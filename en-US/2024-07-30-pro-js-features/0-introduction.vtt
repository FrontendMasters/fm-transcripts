00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.326
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: This
is professional JS workshop,

2
00:00:02.326 --> 00:00:03.923
features you need to know.

3
00:00:03.923 --> 00:00:05.783
My name is Maximiliano Firtman.

4
00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.970
I can go by Max.

5
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.900
That's okay.

6
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.380
Firt on many social networks or
Firtman, Firt or Firtman.

7
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.247
So it depends so on X I'm Firt,
on GitHub Firtman, my last name.

8
00:00:17.247 --> 00:00:19.763
Let me go really quickly
about my experience.

9
00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:20.929
So I am from Argentina.

10
00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.199
So I live in Buenos Aires and
I'm a mobile web developer.

11
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.282
So I have been doing website since
forever, actually, but really from 1996.

12
00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:35.017
And also mobile apps since
2001 before the iPhone,

13
00:00:35.017 --> 00:00:38.679
before the Android,
BlackBerry, Nokia, and so on.

14
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.019
But HTML in particular since 1996 and
JavaScript since 1998.

15
00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.907
And I have developed more than 150
web apps that were deployed at some

16
00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:50.717
time in the past or in the present.

17
00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.457
And I'm also an author.

18
00:00:52.457 --> 00:00:55.657
So I authored 13 books and
more than 70 courses,

19
00:00:55.657 --> 00:01:00.456
a lot of courses here at Frontend Masters,
and a lot of books in English,

20
00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:04.858
and also in other languages
with translations, actually.

21
00:01:04.858 --> 00:01:08.070
And most of my books
are currently around the web and

22
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.188
the mobile space sometimes
web performance and so on.

23
00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:19.541
The last kind of book that I author is
Learn PWA, that is free on web.dev.

24
00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:23.886
Web.dev, it's from the Google Chrome team.

25
00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:26.086
It's just on progressive web apps.

26
00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:31.027
And at Frontend Masters, you will
find a lot of content that I authored

27
00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:35.046
on Frontend, mobile apps,
Swift, Kotlin, Dart, and

28
00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:39.688
Flutter, and also some backend courses,
including PHP and Go.

29
00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.119
So, what is for this workshop?

30
00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.987
So we will actually talk
about JavaScript and

31
00:01:46.987 --> 00:01:49.935
professional features
that you need to know.

32
00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:53.752
Let's talk about the latest
version of JavaScript.

33
00:01:53.752 --> 00:01:58.672
Actually, we'll talk about something known
as ECMAScript that some of you may already

34
00:01:58.672 --> 00:02:02.660
know, but some of you may have not
really understood what's going on,

35
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.339
what's ECMAScript, okay?

36
00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:09.209
So we'll talk about ECMAScript,
the versions of ECMAScript available.

37
00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.849
We will do a recap of ES6 or
ECMAScript 6 version, that at this point,

38
00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.267
most web developers know at
least some of the features.

39
00:02:19.267 --> 00:02:20.835
So we will do a recap of that.

40
00:02:20.835 --> 00:02:23.744
So we are on the same page.

41
00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:27.144
And after that,
we will start talking about the new stuff.

42
00:02:27.144 --> 00:02:32.484
And we will organize those
new topics by category.

43
00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:34.924
So first talking about
language enhancements.

44
00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:39.893
So things that we have new operators,
for example, that we have or

45
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:46.117
new syntax that we have available in
JavaScript for some specific purposes.

46
00:02:46.117 --> 00:02:49.017
Then we will get into array and
collections.

47
00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:51.147
So what do we have new?

48
00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:52.717
We have new collections.

49
00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:56.587
We have also new ways to work with
collections, new methods available.

50
00:02:56.587 --> 00:02:58.457
So we will talk about that.

51
00:02:58.457 --> 00:03:01.241
Then get into async programming.

52
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:06.444
So probably you have already worked
with promises, but we'll do a recap

53
00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:11.721
of promises and also the new things
that we have to work with promises.

54
00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:15.647
And by the way, when we're talking
about JavaScript here today,

55
00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:18.701
we're not just talking about client side.

56
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:23.573
We can also be talking about
the server side as well with Node.js or

57
00:03:23.573 --> 00:03:25.698
with other framework.

58
00:03:25.698 --> 00:03:28.810
So actually, we are talking about
the language, JavaScript, and

59
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.008
not one particular platform.

60
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.346
And then we will end the day with
some advanced techniques and

61
00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:38.218
advanced ideas that might not be
suitable for all of the projects.

62
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.110
They are for very specific situations.

63
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.930
But anyway,
they are there today in the language.

64
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.320
So prerequisites for this workshop,
just basic JavaScript experience.

65
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.771
So if you have ever played with Node.js
scripts or JavaScript client-side or

66
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:58.040
React or Angular or
even TypeScript, you're good to go.

67
00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.618
Some OOP experience is good.

68
00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:02.108
I mean, if you know what a class is,

69
00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:05.598
inheritance you understand
the basic concepts.

70
00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:07.961
And also for today, just a web browser.

71
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:10.491
That's the only thing you need,
not even a code editor, okay?

72
00:04:10.491 --> 00:04:13.661
So I will give you a URL
later to where we are.

73
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:15.817
We will follow along the course,

74
00:04:15.817 --> 00:04:20.372
the workshop with the new stuff that
we have available in JavaScript.

75
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:28.574
So actually, that's the site,
it's firtman.github.io/projs,

76
00:04:28.574 --> 00:04:33.680
that's just an online editor
where we will be covering

77
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.453
most of the stuff that we
have today in JavaScript.
