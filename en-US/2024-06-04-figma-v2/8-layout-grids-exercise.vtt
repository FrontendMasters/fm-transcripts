00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:03.091
Take two minutes and
just get a taste of this.

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:07.247
And we have two frames that
have some names, 2 columns,

3
00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:10.625
36 pixel margins, 16 pixel gutters, and

4
00:00:10.625 --> 00:00:15.562
that ability to kind of like either
adding the padding with 1 row and

5
00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:20.498
1 column or the other way where you
put a column in each side in top and

6
00:00:20.498 --> 00:00:23.124
bottom to kinda get those in place.

7
00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:25.979
And then we'll do that together and
then we'll look at how constraints and

8
00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:27.625
layout grids play nicely with each other.

9
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:41.629
So our mission here is we had
two little kinda mini exercises.

10
00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.403
So, 2 columns, 36 pixel margins,
16 pixel gutters.

11
00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:50.216
So again,
that involves one grid in this case.

12
00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:54.400
So we'll go ahead,
we'll add a layout grid, and

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.092
we will go ahead and switch that to
columns where we want two of them.

14
00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:07.615
And in this case the margin is 36 and
the gutter is 16, right?

15
00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:12.031
You'll notice that if you
switch this to it's offset and

16
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.161
not margin, but in stretch its margin.

17
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:19.097
So that will change depending on
the context in which you use it.

18
00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:22.452
But generally speaking,
it's the word that makes more sense for

19
00:01:22.452 --> 00:01:23.922
the context that you are in.

20
00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:25.935
All right, that was easy.

21
00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.672
So now we just want this
idea of 20 pixel padding.

22
00:01:29.672 --> 00:01:36.179
Now you could theoretically use it,
just a regular grid, right?

23
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.338
So I could change that to 20 and

24
00:01:39.338 --> 00:01:44.018
that will definitely
make it possible to do 20

25
00:01:44.018 --> 00:01:49.051
pixel padding on this
div/frame/ what have you.

26
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:52.384
The other way to do it as we saw
before is if I only want that and

27
00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:56.856
I don't want all those intermediary grid
squares, I can either make one row and

28
00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:59.687
one column or
kind of do those different borders.

29
00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:02.956
If I'm just trying to do the padding,
a lot of times I'll do the one row,

30
00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.327
one column because it's half as much work,
right?

31
00:02:05.327 --> 00:02:07.517
But if I need to do
stuff like the navbars,

32
00:02:07.517 --> 00:02:11.411
that's when I'll do the kind of one
row on the bottom, one row on the top.

33
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:14.717
Let's go ahead and
we'll make this a row and in this case,

34
00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:16.551
we want to 20 pixels padding.

35
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:20.401
So we take this down to one.

36
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:25.958
And then we can do 20 on both sides here.

37
00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.198
And then I can go ahead and
add a second one.

38
00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:32.860
Again, if you find yourself doing this
a lot, it makes sense to save them so

39
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.450
that you can go and just apply that again.

40
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:42.601
So we'll go ahead and we'll make
the column, make one column, 20, great.

41
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:47.770
And again, if you wanted to theoretically
make them visually different,

42
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.418
you can do that as well.

43
00:02:49.418 --> 00:02:53.034
And also if you need to hide any of them
because you're like that's great for

44
00:02:53.034 --> 00:02:56.102
laying something out, but
now I don't ever wanna see it again.

45
00:02:56.102 --> 00:02:57.839
You can do that as well.

46
00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:02.307
Thing that I didn't think
about until just now is day.

47
00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.267
Let's see.

48
00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:05.276
Well, they still snapper,
they're invisible,

49
00:03:05.276 --> 00:03:08.088
I don't know the answer to that
question but let's find out together.

50
00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:17.164
Now they're invisible, they don't do
anything, cool, but they are visible.

51
00:03:24.214 --> 00:03:26.361
You can see that it
will now actually snap.

52
00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:29.742
And it's easy to kind of like align
something with any of those grid lines, so

53
00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:30.745
on and so forth, yes.

54
00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:32.827
&gt;&gt; How do you save the grids?

55
00:03:32.827 --> 00:03:36.868
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if you wanna save the grid so
let's say I love this grid, I wanna use it

56
00:03:36.868 --> 00:03:40.615
forever and ever and ever, you go ahead,
you can do it as a save style.

57
00:03:40.615 --> 00:03:43.555
So we can go ahead and we grab these,

58
00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:49.156
we got to decide what the term of art
is gonna be for four little dots.

59
00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:52.339
You can go ahead and
hit this plus sign, and

60
00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:55.977
you can give it a name of
like 20 pixel padding.

61
00:03:55.977 --> 00:04:01.589
And this is useful for just communicating
what the intended purposes,

62
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.714
but go ahead and
see everything in this case as well.

63
00:04:05.714 --> 00:04:08.771
We'll create the style and now it's saved.

64
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:13.269
So if I go ahead make a new frame right
here and I go ahead, I wanna add a layout

65
00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.924
grid and click this again and look,
there's my new 20 pixel padding grid.

66
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.502
And there it is, and
I can apply that to anything I want, and

67
00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.802
I can never set that up again, right?

68
00:04:23.802 --> 00:04:26.367
And again,
one thing we'll look at towards the end,

69
00:04:26.367 --> 00:04:28.537
is how to publish your libraries and
styles.

70
00:04:28.537 --> 00:04:32.257
So you can say you have one file that is
all of your kind of design system tokens

71
00:04:32.257 --> 00:04:35.746
and stuff along those lines,
all the kind of foundational pieces, and

72
00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.333
then share that with everyone
in the organization.

73
00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:42.335
So then you can have multiple project
files for various different things,

74
00:04:42.335 --> 00:04:46.334
that all have the same, this is the amount
of padding we use around this, so

75
00:04:46.334 --> 00:04:47.244
on and so forth.

76
00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:52.176
And that's especially powerful when we
get to components and variables and stuff

77
00:04:52.176 --> 00:04:57.196
along those lines 'cause then you can
take, let's say you had 62 design files.

78
00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:02.030
And you needed to change the border
radius on the primary button for

79
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.593
all of them, right?

80
00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:05.708
Then you can do that in
the one source file.

81
00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:09.998
And there's a bunch of mechanics for
people can opt in when they're ready for

82
00:05:09.998 --> 00:05:12.514
those updates to happen,
so on and so forth.

83
00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:16.438
But in a given file, as you start kind
of finding the pieces that you use for

84
00:05:16.438 --> 00:05:21.145
lots of different things, for different
shadows, colors, stuff along those lines.

85
00:05:21.145 --> 00:05:24.875
You can save them as styles and
apply them all over the place.
