1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.439
But this only works with the general
idea of a frame and its bounds, right?

2
00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:11.491
A lot of times, a lot of our designs
have some idea of a grid system or

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:15.836
some amount of padding that we
need to be aware of as well.

4
00:00:15.836 --> 00:00:20.507
And Figma has some tools that
help us with that as well.

5
00:00:20.507 --> 00:00:22.342
And they are called layout grids.

6
00:00:22.342 --> 00:00:29.640
And layout grids and constraints actually
overlap and have a lot in common as well.

7
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.297
But let's go ahead and just play around
with some to get a sense of how they work.

8
00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:37.515
So I will leave these for
you to implement in a second.

9
00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.681
We'll have some challenges
in here as well.

10
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:40.907
But I'm gonna go ahead and

11
00:00:40.907 --> 00:00:44.093
just make myself a fun little new
frame that we can play around with.

12
00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:48.668
So I'll hit the F key to switch to
the Frame tool and I will draw a frame.

13
00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:50.467
Yay, here's a frame.

14
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:56.460
So over here we can add this idea of
layout grids and hit the plus sign.

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.808
And at first it will go ahead and
it will create a grid.

16
00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:01.925
Seems great.

17
00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:04.360
That's what it says on the tin.

18
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.683
You can go ahead and click here and
you can change the size of the grid.

19
00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:08.344
So right now it's 10 pixels.

20
00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:10.198
You can change that to whatever you want.

21
00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:13.050
This color, you can change it.

22
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.492
That's the red lines, they're red.

23
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.382
You can change it to
blue if you really want.

24
00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:20.097
That's the opacity of them.

25
00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:25.030
You can add multiple grids, right, two 10
pixel grids don't really do much for me.

26
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.771
Let's go ahead, we'll change this
one to like, I don't know, 25,

27
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:31.337
make it nice and weird.

28
00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:33.918
That's unhinged.

29
00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:35.004
And we can change it to blue.

30
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:38.862
And you can see you can layer
multiple grids on top of each other.

31
00:01:38.862 --> 00:01:39.834
Don't do that.

32
00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:43.134
There is a time and a place for
why you would do that.

33
00:01:43.134 --> 00:01:48.084
I don't tend to use the grid so
much unless I'm kind of

34
00:01:48.084 --> 00:01:52.938
like trying to do,
honestly pixel art, which I do.

35
00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:56.789
But generally speaking, when I'm
trying to do layouts for websites,

36
00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.529
cuz I like to make money,
there's a different kinda grid that I use.

37
00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:03.112
And so we can go ahead and create a grid.

38
00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:08.182
And if you click here, this is very
subtle, but it's the drop down menu.

39
00:02:08.182 --> 00:02:09.982
You've got columns.

40
00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:15.275
Now that looks a little bit more like
what I'm used to having to implement,

41
00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:16.378
and then rows.

42
00:02:16.378 --> 00:02:19.456
And there's a time and
place for both of them, and

43
00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:21.884
sometimes literally for both of them.

44
00:02:21.884 --> 00:02:25.234
But let's actually start with
the columns real quick, right?

45
00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:27.871
This will give you some
amount of column layout.

46
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:32.017
The other things that you can
do is you can give it a margin.

47
00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:37.042
So I can say hey,
we want 48 pixels on each side.

48
00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:39.034
This was a lot smaller
than I thought it was.

49
00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:41.114
So let's actually say 16, right?

50
00:02:41.114 --> 00:02:43.619
So now you've got some margins there.

51
00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.897
You can say that they should stretch
to fill the entire width of the frame,

52
00:02:47.897 --> 00:02:52.659
you can give a gutter, and so that's
the space in between, so I'll make this 8.

53
00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.174
There's less space in between each column.

54
00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:59.033
If I say 24, there's more space
between each column, right,

55
00:02:59.033 --> 00:03:01.218
depends on what you are trying to do.

56
00:03:01.218 --> 00:03:04.812
I can change this as well,
I can say instead of stretch,

57
00:03:04.812 --> 00:03:08.883
put them in the center, and
then I can give them a width as well.

58
00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:12.252
Stretch is going to kinda
evenly divide them up.

59
00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:15.356
But if I know that I just want
five columns in the center,

60
00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:19.716
I'm gonna make these like, then no matter
what, if I change the size of this,

61
00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:22.911
they stay the same width,
they just center themselves.

62
00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:28.167
And if for some reason I want
to put them to the right or

63
00:03:28.167 --> 00:03:31.646
to the left, I can do that as well.

64
00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:36.441
I'm gonna be honest with you,
never done it, never had a reason,

65
00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:39.278
it's either center or stretch for me.

66
00:03:39.278 --> 00:03:40.706
And you can put those in place.

67
00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:45.704
Now, the other useful thing that
you can do with a layout grid

68
00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:48.258
is it might seem insane to you.

69
00:03:48.258 --> 00:03:50.130
But you know what's really useful?

70
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.825
One column or one row, right,
allow me to demonstrate.

71
00:03:55.825 --> 00:04:01.514
And so let's say we make one column,
right?

72
00:04:01.514 --> 00:04:04.504
I lied, I use left and right and
top and bottom all the time.

73
00:04:04.504 --> 00:04:05.689
I'm about to show you.

74
00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.808
I just never did it with multiple columns.

75
00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:10.738
Okay, so we can make one column and

76
00:04:10.738 --> 00:04:16.194
then I can also add another grid,
and we'll make this one a row,

77
00:04:16.194 --> 00:04:20.965
and we'll say one row and
we'll get give it the margin.

78
00:04:20.965 --> 00:04:23.027
What did I say, 16 before?

79
00:04:23.027 --> 00:04:27.598
All right, and you can see what I kinda
did here is I gave myself the ability to

80
00:04:27.598 --> 00:04:30.186
have a certain amount of padding in place.

81
00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:35.089
Now, if I give myself another frame,
let's give this a color.

82
00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:37.174
I don't know, anything works.

83
00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:40.184
Not red, ideally.

84
00:04:40.184 --> 00:04:44.966
Green, right, you can see that the same
snapping that we had against frame edges

85
00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:47.089
works against our layout bridges.

86
00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:48.979
Also, if you had the five columns or

87
00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.565
the however many rows
it'll work there as well.

88
00:04:51.565 --> 00:04:58.325
And so you can get a sense of snapping
it into the padding, so on and so forth.

89
00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:03.363
So like there is a time and
a place for one row and one column.

90
00:05:03.363 --> 00:05:10.653
The other thing that I will do sometimes
is the exact opposite of this, right?

91
00:05:10.653 --> 00:05:13.334
This is where I just
said that I was a liar.

92
00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:16.362
So we can take the one column one row, and

93
00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:20.106
let's say hypothetically I had,
I don't know,

94
00:05:20.106 --> 00:05:25.207
a top navigation and a bottom bar
like I did in the previous example.

95
00:05:25.207 --> 00:05:29.672
What I'll do in that
case is I might say top,

96
00:05:29.672 --> 00:05:34.017
and I'll give it no offset and
a height of,

97
00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:37.907
let's say it's a 48 pixel navbar.

98
00:05:37.907 --> 00:05:39.939
And I might make a second
one at the bottom.

99
00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:45.025
So for instance,
I can go ahead and make one row,

100
00:05:47.744 --> 00:05:50.203
Put that at the bottom.

101
00:05:50.203 --> 00:05:54.487
So 48, right, so now I have the idea
of where I could put the top nav and

102
00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:57.786
the bottom nav without having
to get the pixels right.

103
00:05:57.786 --> 00:06:03.291
And this could be theoretically
a reusable layout grid that I use,

104
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:09.994
especially if this was more iPhone size,
then you could see a more device sized.

105
00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:13.727
It becomes a very useful kinda way to lay
out that top nav, the bottom nav, and

106
00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:16.272
get everything in place and
set up the constraints.

107
00:06:16.272 --> 00:06:20.844
The other thing that you can do, and
we'll talk more about styles later,

108
00:06:20.844 --> 00:06:23.735
is that you can theoretically
then save that.

109
00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:27.260
Like hey, we know that the navbar
should be this tall and

110
00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.413
the bottom bar,
cuz it's harder than you think.

111
00:06:30.413 --> 00:06:37.271
You're like, I make webpages,
48 pixels, whatever, rems.

112
00:06:37.271 --> 00:06:43.720
All these devices, though, they have
notches and cameras and curves and stuff.

113
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.806
So it's not actually one has
to do the math to know it's 88

114
00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:50.601
pixels from the top for the iPhone 15.

115
00:06:50.601 --> 00:06:53.207
I don't know why I know that,
let me tell you, it's the hard way.

116
00:06:53.207 --> 00:06:55.824
So you can create
the different layout grids so

117
00:06:55.824 --> 00:07:00.129
that you basically don't have to remember
how far down the navbar has to go.

118
00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.760
You can kind of lay out these things and
things will snap in place, and

119
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:07.150
they're nice guides, and
you can save them and use them later.

120
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:14.362
Awesome, and then you can put something
there and it'll totally work.
