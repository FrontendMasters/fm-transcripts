00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
At this point, at this moment,

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.797
you are probably good enough
a figment to be dangerous.

3
00:00:07.797 --> 00:00:12.459
Now we get into a victory lap

4
00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.131
of things that are useful.

5
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:22.515
We also get into the part of the portion
that is somewhat paywalls, right,

6
00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:28.167
and so, follow along gets a little bit
harder at this point, but that is okay.

7
00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:33.158
I will take you on a tour because
theoretically if you use this for

8
00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:37.696
side projects, yeah,
maybe you stick to the free stuff.

9
00:00:37.696 --> 00:00:42.784
Design team is the one that is
footing the bill for and Figma, so

10
00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:48.257
I have a paid Figma account, and
most of these things are brand new.

11
00:00:48.257 --> 00:00:52.504
So years and years of designs made
in Figma before any of these,

12
00:00:52.504 --> 00:00:57.245
you do not need a paid Figma account
except for some of these features.

13
00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:02.397
So the other thing that variables

14
00:01:02.397 --> 00:01:09.944
support are these things called modes,
right?

15
00:01:09.944 --> 00:01:11.990
So, a free account you get no modes or

16
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.229
you get one mode technically
which is no modes, right?.

17
00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.680
Modes are only helpful if
you have more than one.

18
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.792
But on a paid account, you can have modes,
you can have up to four,

19
00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:27.051
it's interesting, the starter I'm
gonna pay for myself account,

20
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:31.322
you get four modes, the professional
account, you get four modes.

21
00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:35.461
If you go to enterprise, which I
don't even have, you get 40, right?

22
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:40.323
It's not like you got four and this
one eight this one, it's like 0, 4, 4,

23
00:01:40.323 --> 00:01:44.243
40, I don't ever wanna work at
a company where I need 40 modes.

24
00:01:44.243 --> 00:01:48.565
Especially when you see a mode,
you're gonna cry the idea of having 40.

25
00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:52.662
As a developer, you're going to cry
cuz you know what that would mean for

26
00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:53.951
you in your code base.

27
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:58.753
Cool, so let's take a look,
so I have some setup here.

28
00:01:58.753 --> 00:02:01.427
So we go into variables, and for

29
00:02:01.427 --> 00:02:05.598
the component colors you
can see I have two modes.

30
00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:10.526
And this is kinda what we were
talking about a little bit before, so

31
00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:16.158
if I look at my primary button color,
right, before we had this one column,

32
00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:19.596
I have two modes setup and
see what that means.

33
00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:24.835
I have two columns,
one of them I have called Light and

34
00:02:24.835 --> 00:02:28.105
the other one I have called Dark.

35
00:02:28.105 --> 00:02:31.717
You can take a lucky guess
what I'm doing here.

36
00:02:31.717 --> 00:02:36.982
So now I can go ahead and
I can take this button, and,

37
00:02:36.982 --> 00:02:43.825
cool, here it is, and again,
you didn't even notice that there.

38
00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:46.707
I was talking about this button here,
nobody saw this little icon.

39
00:02:46.707 --> 00:02:50.621
That's two hexagons, two hexagons.

40
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:53.939
Let's double the code.

41
00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:59.729
So this one I can switch it on component
colors, I can switch it to dark mode,

42
00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.526
which is a lighter button,
as somebody who just spent six weeks

43
00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:08.348
implementing dark mode,
I don't recommend it.

44
00:03:08.348 --> 00:03:10.709
I mean, do it cuz everyone wanted it, but

45
00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.241
everything's lighter cuz everything's
darker, it's counterintuitive.

46
00:03:15.241 --> 00:03:17.611
So you can switch it
from light to dark and

47
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:21.741
like those variables then change
to their other properties, right?

48
00:03:21.741 --> 00:03:25.667
And what's kinda cool about
this is that like CSS or

49
00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:30.980
like JavaScript, there's some
amount of cascading inheritance.

50
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.906
I just took two words that
mean different things and

51
00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:39.027
put ' together and
you all nodded, so it's cool.

52
00:03:39.027 --> 00:03:41.031
So here I can take a frame, and,

53
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:45.043
let's say that it's Phil is I
have not in these primitives, and

54
00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:50.197
I would never publish the primitives, but
in this file, I have to deal with them.

55
00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:52.867
I have one called Background, right?

56
00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:57.945
And Background is white in light mode,
and it's slate 950 cuz

57
00:03:57.945 --> 00:04:03.771
one time I read something you should
never actually use black, whatever.

58
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:09.121
And so it's slate 950 in dark mode,
and so what I can do,

59
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:13.722
there it is in dark mode,
there it is in light mode,

60
00:04:13.722 --> 00:04:18.331
there it is in dark mode,
there it is in light mode.

61
00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:19.408
So I can drag this button in.

62
00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:25.231
And you know what, let's,
let's get two more buttons.

63
00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:27.165
Let's toss in a primary button.

64
00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:33.212
Let's toss in a secondary button too,
let's put lots of buttons in here.

65
00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:41.323
It's great, then let's take this frame,
If we switch to dark mode,

66
00:04:41.323 --> 00:04:47.973
all of the subsequent lesser
values also switch into dark mode.

67
00:04:47.973 --> 00:04:50.306
So, and you can't do this with styles and

68
00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:54.448
this is where the difference between
variable and styles kind of exists.

69
00:04:54.448 --> 00:04:56.304
If you have two modes,

70
00:04:56.304 --> 00:05:01.199
then it like if I look at this
button right now, it is set to,

71
00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:10.412
It's set to auto now, it wasn't before,
the other two were though, so it's fine.

72
00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:12.961
It's set to auto,
which means it will inherit, right?

73
00:05:12.961 --> 00:05:16.020
And so they don't care if there
is a parent above them in

74
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.094
the frame hierarchy that has a mode set,
it will then inherit that mode.

75
00:05:20.094 --> 00:05:24.265
If you all your code is the variables, and
you have these two sets of modes, right,

76
00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:26.768
you can throw together
your dark mode prototype,

77
00:05:26.768 --> 00:05:30.536
just by dragging the same components and
re-arranging them in dark mode.

78
00:05:30.536 --> 00:05:37.982
And that I would argue is
the most common case for modes.
