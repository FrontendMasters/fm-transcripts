00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.399
So with that, let's talk a little bit
about kind of just moving stuff around and

2
00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:07.670
getting stuff aligned, right?

3
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.507
And so
Figma does a lot to make your life easier.

4
00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:15.852
It's not like you have to have like
an eagle eye where you can see literally

5
00:00:15.852 --> 00:00:16.704
everything.

6
00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:21.618
In this case, you notice that you
can go and drag something, that for

7
00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:25.111
the most part,
let's zoom in a little bit here.

8
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:31.511
As we get close to another object,
you'll see that it begins to snap.

9
00:00:31.511 --> 00:00:36.446
And on my MacBook trackpad,
there's tactile feedback when something

10
00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:40.160
like is snapping into place,
your mileage may vary.

11
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.585
You can see, okay, if they are kind of
equidistant from the next one near it,

12
00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:49.941
it'll give you a few of those
things to kinda snap into place.

13
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:53.636
You can also hold Option, for
instance, and measure things.

14
00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:55.480
We'll see that in
the next session as well.

15
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.491
The distance between various units.

16
00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.631
But sometimes it makes sense to, like,
hey, I have a whole bunch of stuff and

17
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:03.425
I want to kinda align it, right?

18
00:01:03.425 --> 00:01:08.563
So in any of those cases, you can choose
any of these options over here and

19
00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:11.020
begin to align some stuff as well.

20
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.073
So let's actually take a look at that,
in some use cases,

21
00:01:15.073 --> 00:01:19.069
where with three boxes,
not that hard to drag it around.

22
00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.381
Let's up the ante to five, right?

23
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.205
Could I sit there and
try to get them all equidistant over time?

24
00:01:25.205 --> 00:01:27.085
Absolutely, I could.

25
00:01:27.085 --> 00:01:28.122
Do I want to?

26
00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:29.721
No, I don't.

27
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:33.080
So what I can do is kinda make
use of some of the initial tools.

28
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.851
So here I can select all of
them by clicking and dragging.

29
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:39.902
You could hold Shift and
click on each one of them individually,

30
00:01:39.902 --> 00:01:42.761
whatever makes you the happiest,
go for it.

31
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:44.184
And then we can align it either,

32
00:01:44.184 --> 00:01:47.052
I don't wanna do any of these cuz
these are on the vertical axes.

33
00:01:47.052 --> 00:01:50.155
But if I wanna get these all
in the same horizontal axis,

34
00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:54.127
I can do a line to the top, the vertical
centers of each or to the bottom.

35
00:01:54.127 --> 00:01:58.447
In this case, doesn't really matter which
one I pick, but I could theoretically line

36
00:01:58.447 --> 00:02:01.953
them all vertically centered, and
that gets me most of the way there.

37
00:02:01.953 --> 00:02:04.510
But you can kinda see there's some
like different spacing in here.

38
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.643
And you'll look, I get this icon here
that is very similar to the icon there.

39
00:02:09.643 --> 00:02:11.617
And there's Tidy up.

40
00:02:11.617 --> 00:02:13.975
There's also,
if I just wanna do on one axes,

41
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:18.025
I can distribute the vertical spacing,
which they're all on the same axis, or

42
00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:21.056
the horizontal spacing,
at which point they all even out.

43
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:25.406
And one of the really cool things that
you'll see is when they are even, and

44
00:02:25.406 --> 00:02:30.189
it knows they're even, it gives you the
ability to adjust that either manually.

45
00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.443
So I can change this to 32 if I want, or

46
00:02:33.443 --> 00:02:37.799
I can kind of grab in the middle here and
drag as well.

47
00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.514
So you can do that either on the X or
the Y axis.

48
00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:45.555
You can also, if you have maybe like
a grid of things, you can go ahead and

49
00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:50.863
get this all in place where you can see
that, it'll try to guess what I need.

50
00:02:50.863 --> 00:02:54.028
So we've got the vertical spacing and
the horizontal spacing.

51
00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:58.406
Neither one of these is
gonna do what I want, right.

52
00:02:58.406 --> 00:03:00.488
That's not what I need.

53
00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:05.270
So what I can do is this Tidy up
will do the best to arrange stuff in

54
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.453
the closest it can to a grid.

55
00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:12.323
And the thing you'll notice here now is
because things are evenly distributed

56
00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:17.276
on both kind of the x and the y-axis,
I can actually adjust either one of those.

57
00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:20.800
And I can either change the number or we
can see I get this little curse like this,

58
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.758
I can do this motion.

59
00:03:21.758 --> 00:03:26.168
And there's a lot of tactile feedback
from the trackpad and feels great and

60
00:03:26.168 --> 00:03:28.977
kind of aligned stuff in
a way that makes sense.

61
00:03:28.977 --> 00:03:31.001
You can do the same thing like this.

62
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.815
And those will be when
everything is uniform.

63
00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:37.469
One of the things that we'll find out in
our time together is there's a lot to love

64
00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:38.127
about Figma.

65
00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:43.123
One of the kind of slightly
tedious things is like certain

66
00:03:43.123 --> 00:03:47.925
features will only appear
when they're applicable.

67
00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:52.161
And if it's not a place where you can do
that thing, you just won't see the tool,

68
00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:55.648
but the presence of the tool means
you can do the thing, as well as,

69
00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:58.361
like I said before,
I can adjust the spacing here.

70
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:02.257
There are lots of options but that, again,

71
00:04:02.257 --> 00:04:07.750
only happens when they are in
an even distribution like this.

72
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.529
Cool, let's see what else we got in here.

73
00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.449
We do have an exercise for
you, which is basically

74
00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:18.286
taking some of the stuff you just
saw me do and taking it for a spin.

75
00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:21.621
So in this case, we've got somethings
that are out of order, right?

76
00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:24.418
Why don't you spend a few minutes and
just,

77
00:04:24.418 --> 00:04:29.408
we're just trying to get warmed up here,
and kinda get to the point where we can

78
00:04:29.408 --> 00:04:33.203
kinda take on some definitely
more ambitious challenges.

79
00:04:33.203 --> 00:04:38.020
But just in terms of getting a feel for
Figma itself, let's see if we can

80
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.943
kind of make the top picture look
a little bit more like the bottom picture

81
00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:50.974
All right, so now,
another particularly special here,

82
00:04:50.974 --> 00:04:54.665
what we can do is we can hold Shift and
grab a bunch of these.

83
00:04:54.665 --> 00:04:58.108
One thing you'll notice is, if you're
not getting anything that you want, and

84
00:04:58.108 --> 00:05:01.245
I'll talk about this a little bit later,
too, you can hold Command, and

85
00:05:01.245 --> 00:05:03.290
it'll be literally
the thing under the mouse.

86
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.383
So if you're not always getting exactly,
cuz it's trying, there's a lot going on.

87
00:05:07.383 --> 00:05:09.888
There's a lot of stacked layers.

88
00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:13.911
You can hold Command, you can hold Shift,
select multiple things.

89
00:05:13.911 --> 00:05:18.711
Here, I can try this out, and it will
give me at least the vertical spacing,

90
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:23.137
and then I could theoretically put
them all on the same axis like this.

91
00:05:23.137 --> 00:05:26.323
Similarly, I can do this here as well.

92
00:05:26.323 --> 00:05:28.668
It will try to even them out like that,
but

93
00:05:28.668 --> 00:05:30.954
then I can also put them on the same axis.

94
00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:34.383
One of the other things that you
can do is, yeah, theoretically,

95
00:05:34.383 --> 00:05:36.658
did I spiritually complete this exercise?

96
00:05:36.658 --> 00:05:37.782
I did.

97
00:05:37.782 --> 00:05:39.493
Are they exact matches?

98
00:05:39.493 --> 00:05:40.910
They're not.

99
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.587
So the other option that you always
have is actually looking at the values

100
00:05:45.587 --> 00:05:46.515
themselves.

101
00:05:46.515 --> 00:05:48.096
And you can do a few cool things here.

102
00:05:48.096 --> 00:05:52.457
One, I could theoretically, okay,

103
00:05:52.457 --> 00:05:57.372
this is 61, 51, this is 30, 40.

104
00:05:57.372 --> 00:06:01.154
I can adjust them by
hand by typing in values.

105
00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:04.220
And you'll notice that these are relative
to the frame that they're in, and

106
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.074
we'll talk about frames
in the next section.

107
00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:08.509
But they're relative to,
let's just call it a box for now.

108
00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:13.309
The box that they're in,
you can do math in these, right?

109
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:19.905
For instance, you can write 30 plus 21 and
it will update to 51.

110
00:06:19.905 --> 00:06:22.886
You can also divide by half.

111
00:06:22.886 --> 00:06:25.459
Let's say, hypothetically,
you're working on a workshop and

112
00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:28.605
you took a bunch of retina screenshots
that it thought it was double the pixels.

113
00:06:28.605 --> 00:06:35.508
You could just do slash two and cut the
width in half and stuff along those lines.

114
00:06:35.508 --> 00:06:39.279
So you can get a lot of that
kinda in place here and

115
00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.155
adjust stuff as needed,
and move stuff in bulk.

116
00:06:43.155 --> 00:06:44.850
Again, option will show you the distance.

117
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.549
So these are 84 apart.

118
00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:51.366
These are 84 apart, so it's really just
bulk moving these in the right direction.

119
00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:53.144
Could I sit here and adjust the pixels?

120
00:06:53.144 --> 00:06:54.836
11, totally.

121
00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:59.277
I think we've got most of the point there,
but to show that there are lots of

122
00:06:59.277 --> 00:07:04.300
different ways to have some introspection
and manipulate the position of objects.

123
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:09.188
Seems really low level, so it's things
that make using some of these tools

124
00:07:09.188 --> 00:07:13.392
really frustrating or like,
I know how to do these things.

125
00:07:13.392 --> 00:07:18.003
If you've seen the movie The Matrix, it's
basically that, but you're using Figma.
