00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.282
All right,
your job is to create a some kinda navbar.

2
00:00:05.282 --> 00:00:08.994
You can either take one inspired
by Instagram or you can kind of,

3
00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:12.980
I left some icons here for whatever
you wanna do, some of these are for

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.037
them bottom nav, whatever,
do whatever you want.

5
00:00:16.037 --> 00:00:21.007
But the idea is we want at
least the logo and the avatar,

6
00:00:21.007 --> 00:00:24.790
and then a search field
which will grow and

7
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.783
shrink kind of based on
the size of the navigation bar.

8
00:00:33.123 --> 00:00:39.934
So our mission is to create something
that looks kinda like a navigation bar.

9
00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:43.688
We've got some component
pieces laying around here.

10
00:00:43.688 --> 00:00:48.315
Let's go ahead and
start to arrange them in a way that

11
00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:52.957
feels navigationey,
that's the technical term.

12
00:00:52.957 --> 00:00:56.763
We can go ahead and put that maybe in
the middle, and you could decide that you

13
00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:59.876
actually want it over to the right,
you do whatever you want.

14
00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:04.899
I am going to then,
let's go within the middle and

15
00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:08.257
then we'll see how to adjust it.

16
00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:11.141
Maybe messages too,
messages should go up there, right?

17
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:11.818
I don't know.

18
00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:17.035
Put that there as well,
and we can kinda already

19
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:24.481
see a little bit of the structure
of what we're gonna wanna do here.

20
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:30.404
So we'll kind of take this here and
we'll wrap that in a frame and

21
00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:33.596
we'll say account and messages.

22
00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.287
We'll call this one,

23
00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:50.705
So we can take the three of these now,
wrap it in a frame with, again, I can

24
00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:56.403
either right-click and say Frame selection
or on a Mac, its Command option G.

25
00:01:56.403 --> 00:02:02.879
I think it's Ctrl+Alt+G on Windows,
and we've kind of got that in place.

26
00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:10.456
Now, it's not perfect yet,
because that's not what I want to happen.

27
00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:11.124
Are those in there?

28
00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:12.538
Yeah, those are in my frame.

29
00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:22.926
That's not an auto layout just yet.

30
00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:25.935
So actually, what happened.

31
00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:33.571
All right, so,
I don't know if I wanted to change that or

32
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:37.525
not, but we'll find out together,
we'll make this whole auto layout frame.

33
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:40.265
But yeah,
it doesn't stretch the way that I want.

34
00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:43.599
So just wrapping it in auto
layout does not solve my problems

35
00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.674
immediately like I would like it to.

36
00:02:45.674 --> 00:02:47.218
So what do we need to do?

37
00:02:47.218 --> 00:02:55.514
We need to change this from,
Having a fixed gap to auto.

38
00:02:58.091 --> 00:03:00.343
Right, so
now we've got some of that in place.

39
00:03:00.343 --> 00:03:03.098
And so far, not bad, right?

40
00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:06.379
The fact that these are wrapped
together in one nested auto frame,

41
00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.552
we can give that, it's not an auto frame
just yet, but we'll give that one as well.

42
00:03:10.552 --> 00:03:13.048
And then we don't want these to be auto.

43
00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:17.550
We want this one to, let's go with 8,
which is the number we used before, and

44
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.705
we actually have this one
hugged as Contents, right?

45
00:03:20.705 --> 00:03:26.333
So that one will expand and contract
based on what's in it, other than that,

46
00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:30.941
the bar itself will then space
everything out based on its own.

47
00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:34.275
So the navigation bar in and
of itself has a fixed width, and

48
00:03:34.275 --> 00:03:36.754
then everything inside
of it is spaced out.

49
00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:39.734
My icons, on the other hand,
if I wanted to drag another one in,

50
00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:47.460
Go and center those,
I can drag additional,

51
00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.700
I dragged it outside of that thing,
that's what happened.

52
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.869
It was in a frame,
I dragged the vector out, right?

53
00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:00.834
I can drag additional icons in and
that part will then hug the contents with,

54
00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:02.787
again, that 8 pixel space.

55
00:04:02.787 --> 00:04:04.839
And you can change it to 16,
you can do whatever you want.

56
00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:09.415
Other than that, though,
the items themselves space out.

57
00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.515
Now, that kinda gets awkward.

58
00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:17.723
This doesn't really expand or
contract, right?

59
00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:24.104
So I can give this one a fill container,
that's a bit much right as well.

60
00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:29.217
So what I can actually
do here is on the logo,

61
00:04:29.217 --> 00:04:34.470
let's actually give that
one a min width of,

62
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:41.843
let's go with 240, Right?

63
00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:47.436
We'll do the same here,
we'll give this Account and

64
00:04:47.436 --> 00:04:51.910
Messages a min width of 240 as well, and

65
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.283
we'll right align it, right?

66
00:04:55.283 --> 00:04:57.965
And you can increase that
number if you want to,

67
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.591
they'll always have
some amount of padding.

68
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:04.878
The other option here is,
if I didn't wanna do this, cuz eventually,

69
00:05:04.878 --> 00:05:07.451
it will butt up against this as well,
and so

70
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:10.896
that won't necessarily solve
all my problems forever.

71
00:05:10.896 --> 00:05:13.318
Now granted, this is a design, in code,

72
00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:18.040
I think you've gotta be a little bit more
defensive about these things, right?

73
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.050
You can always see that it's not
the way that you thought and change it.

74
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.432
But let's say that if we
added more icons forever,

75
00:05:24.432 --> 00:05:29.163
we'd end up with a problem where it
is smashing up against that as well.

76
00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:34.435
One of the things that macOS does,
if you are in Safari or whatever or

77
00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:39.246
even Finder, and
you're changing the items in that navbar,

78
00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:44.080
is it has this idea of spacers
that you can put in there as well.

79
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.874
So we can try something like that also.

80
00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:53.016
So we can get rid of the min and
max width, I'll say this one.

81
00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:00.996
I'll make that an auto layout as well.

82
00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:04.080
So it's got 8.

83
00:06:06.362 --> 00:06:10.490
And it'll hug the contents, kinda putting
it back to where we had it before.

84
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.798
Same here, we'll get rid of the min width.

85
00:06:14.798 --> 00:06:18.492
So the other option is that we
can add some spacers in here, and

86
00:06:18.492 --> 00:06:24.106
that's really just taking
some kind of frame, Right?

87
00:06:24.106 --> 00:06:30.381
This one happens to be white, but
we can kinda put it in there in between.

88
00:06:31.697 --> 00:06:33.797
This one,
we can get rid of the fill on it,

89
00:06:33.797 --> 00:06:36.934
and we can give that either a min width or
something like that.

90
00:06:36.934 --> 00:06:39.547
We can actually give it
like fill container but

91
00:06:39.547 --> 00:06:43.041
you can give it a max width too or
something along those lines.

92
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.621
So let's add that and
let's give it another copy.

93
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:49.209
So I'm gonna hold Option and
drag it to duplicate it,

94
00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:51.853
you can see the two mouse cursors here.

95
00:06:51.853 --> 00:06:54.889
So then what we can do here is
give these two a max width,

96
00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.672
which means they'll only
grow a certain amount.

97
00:06:57.672 --> 00:07:02.208
And that will let the search bar in
the middle then kind of expand and

98
00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:07.477
contract with the navbar, but with
a certain amount of a bound to it, right?

99
00:07:07.477 --> 00:07:09.766
So we'll grab both of these and

100
00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:14.884
we'll give them a max width instead of,
let's say 180, right?

101
00:07:22.141 --> 00:07:26.901
And so now let's give it
a fill color of white for

102
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:32.025
now, and
let's give it some horizontal padding.

103
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.440
So now I've got a navbar and you can
see that we have that spacing in there,

104
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.915
we'll give it actually some, There we go.

105
00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:50.178
And now it can, Expand and contract with

106
00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:55.662
a certain amount of extra space between
the search bar and the icons, right?

107
00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:57.644
So you have different approaches,

108
00:07:57.644 --> 00:08:01.421
arguably this is gonna be more
resilient to anything we might need.

109
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:04.371
You could also choose to let
these be completely fluid, but

110
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:07.919
give this one a min width and a max
width or something along those lines.

111
00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:09.895
There's various different options.

112
00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:13.978
Honestly, to a certain extent, it's not
necessarily that there's a right way,

113
00:08:13.978 --> 00:08:16.676
they will all mostly achieve
the same effect, right?

114
00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:18.882
As your design grows and changes,

115
00:08:18.882 --> 00:08:23.141
you might find that a certain choice
that you picked might have some

116
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:27.342
implications that does lead you
into one direction or the other.

117
00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:31.515
But at this point, honestly, any of those
approaches mostly get the job done, and

118
00:08:31.515 --> 00:08:35.449
changing them is pretty easy, especially
when we look at components later and

119
00:08:35.449 --> 00:08:38.191
we can see that we can use
one kinda prototype all over,

120
00:08:38.191 --> 00:08:41.557
making those changes then cascades
throughout all your designs.

121
00:08:41.557 --> 00:08:46.548
But the idea of kind of mixing and
matching various auto layout frames will

122
00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:50.334
kinda allow you to build more
sophisticated designs but

123
00:08:50.334 --> 00:08:55.267
then have a very clear analog to how
you would implement them in Flexbox.
