1
00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:04.806
What I'm gonna do is I am going
to create a whole bunch of

2
00:00:04.806 --> 00:00:07.572
components out of these icons.

3
00:00:07.572 --> 00:00:11.462
And that is very easy to do.

4
00:00:11.462 --> 00:00:13.114
If you look, there's a bunch of icons.

5
00:00:13.114 --> 00:00:16.463
I can go ahead and
select all of these frames.

6
00:00:16.463 --> 00:00:19.834
And you'll look I have
a little carrot here now.

7
00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:20.928
What does that do?

8
00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:24.386
I can create one component
of all of these icons.

9
00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:27.449
I can create multiple components,
that's the one we want.

10
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.927
Or I can create components set,
which there is a time and a place for.

11
00:00:30.927 --> 00:00:33.972
This is not the time.

12
00:00:33.972 --> 00:00:35.895
I'm going to do it in
this page in a second, so

13
00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:37.678
it is the place, it's just not the time.

14
00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:40.964
So we'll create multiple components and
look, they all get these,

15
00:00:40.964 --> 00:00:42.073
fine little diamonds.

16
00:00:42.073 --> 00:00:44.723
If I go in to this page,

17
00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:49.742
you can see here are all
of my components and

18
00:00:49.742 --> 00:00:54.353
I got the button from earlier, right?

19
00:00:54.353 --> 00:00:58.326
That I nested in some insane way.

20
00:00:58.326 --> 00:01:02.224
So I'm going to go to
the main component and

21
00:01:02.224 --> 00:01:08.413
we're gonna update this button so
that it supports having an icon.

22
00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:10.878
Right?

23
00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:13.795
And the ability to like
swap out set icons.

24
00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:15.462
So let's actually change
this button a little bit.

25
00:01:15.462 --> 00:01:18.978
Let's make it, let's start by default
having a secondary button here.

26
00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.420
So will give this one a stroke.

27
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.110
Of a little bit of a darker color.

28
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.975
We'll change the fill to
the lighter color, and

29
00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:37.918
we'll change the label to that
same darker color, right?

30
00:01:37.918 --> 00:01:39.895
Okay, cool, we got a button and

31
00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:43.575
we would love the idea of having
an icon in here too, right?

32
00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:45.630
So we can do is, this is auto layout.

33
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.291
So most of it's there.

34
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:51.641
What I can do, is I can drag in this icon.

35
00:01:51.641 --> 00:01:57.834
And that's a little big.

36
00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:00.419
Right?
And so now could I change the stroke on

37
00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:04.927
the, as I said before, selecting all of
the same property is great when you need

38
00:02:04.927 --> 00:02:08.253
to change the stroke in a bunch
of icons asked me how I know.

39
00:02:08.253 --> 00:02:09.246
Right?

40
00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:12.406
But we'll ignore that for a moment.

41
00:02:12.406 --> 00:02:16.612
And we've got this button and so
the trouble with this button is that,

42
00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:21.389
they're all gonna have this bug on them
and maybe I want other icons in the back,

43
00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.622
maybe I want a cool skull that I made.

44
00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:24.241
I didn't make it.

45
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:28.032
I stole it from the side,
which is open source.

46
00:02:28.032 --> 00:02:30.026
And I want to be able
to swap them out right?

47
00:02:30.026 --> 00:02:38.066
And so what I can do is I can
actually go ahead and see this.

48
00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:39.617
I have that bug in there.

49
00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:44.037
I can say create an instant swap property,
right?

50
00:02:44.037 --> 00:02:45.561
We'll call it icon.

51
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:50.542
Maybe by default it's bug, you can
choose a different one if you want.

52
00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:53.257
Plus sign skull.

53
00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.016
Cool.
And then you can do this idea.

54
00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:57.470
So you can swap any component out,

55
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.708
any nested component out with
another component, right?

56
00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:05.816
But what you can do, since that's a lot
of power, Figma doesn't give you a great,

57
00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:08.808
you can get away with a lot of stuff here,
but what you can do,

58
00:03:08.808 --> 00:03:11.594
you can't stop people from
doing certain components.

59
00:03:11.594 --> 00:03:15.364
We can say, here's the preferred
list that I will show you.

60
00:03:15.364 --> 00:03:20.177
So, you can go in here and it's like,
hey, actually you can swap it out

61
00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:24.446
with either any icon or
depending on what your designers want.

62
00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:28.322
Only a certain subset of icons are right
for the button, a certain subset icons or

63
00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:30.551
for the nav,
a certain subset icons are here.

64
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.446
You can basically select those icons,
so we can say check.

65
00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.261
We're not gonna have
a hashtag been a link button.

66
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:39.118
That seems good, info.

67
00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:40.019
I don't know success.

68
00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.530
Great.

69
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.733
So we have this in place.

70
00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:45.659
So now I've got my button here.

71
00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.798
And if I go I can drag another button in.

72
00:03:49.798 --> 00:03:54.616
And you can see that now this button
has the option of swapping it out with

73
00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:56.156
the different icons.

74
00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:57.915
Right?

75
00:03:57.915 --> 00:04:03.208
The other thing I could do is I
think we saw before I'll show

76
00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:08.824
you from the other angle which is
even if we look at this layer,

77
00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:12.196
the skull that goes up to component.

78
00:04:12.196 --> 00:04:16.919
Let's see, we want this layer,

79
00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.637
we can also say show icon.

80
00:04:20.637 --> 00:04:23.129
Sets up the false by default.

81
00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:28.874
And so now I have a button where
I can say, show me the icon,

82
00:04:28.874 --> 00:04:33.227
and if we show the icon,
what icon you want.

83
00:04:33.227 --> 00:04:35.454
We get the idea to have more fluid and

84
00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:39.984
reusable components cause now we have
a button, we can toggle whether or

85
00:04:39.984 --> 00:04:45.105
not we want to show an icon, we can switch
it out between a preferred list of icons,

86
00:04:45.105 --> 00:04:48.668
could they do some dark stuff
like go outside preferred,

87
00:04:48.668 --> 00:04:53.909
go into component properties and find the
badge and shove it in there, they could.

88
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.479
Right, but
that's just like just yell at people.

89
00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.123
We a lot of times look for

90
00:04:58.123 --> 00:05:02.491
technological solutions when
yelling at people is an option.

91
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:05.971
And so yeah,
it's not totally foolproof, but

92
00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:10.756
at least getting guided in the right
way is super helpful as well,

93
00:05:10.756 --> 00:05:14.333
and so we can create a set of components,
right?

94
00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.203
The other thing,
if we look at this system,

95
00:05:17.203 --> 00:05:21.172
you'll notice that there's
this idea of variance as well.

96
00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:27.653
Because one of the things we know is not
only, especially buttons, buttons are.

97
00:05:27.653 --> 00:05:30.883
If we think about the number of buttons
in a design system, it gets out of,

98
00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:32.198
this isn't even all of them.

99
00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:35.550
If I look at the design system we have,
we have way more buttons than this.

100
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.188
Right, you've got your primary, your
destructive, and your secondary buttons.

101
00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:42.618
Great, like those are just, and
I made those different components, and

102
00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:45.569
then you can swap between them
depending on the organization.

103
00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.593
So, one thing I'll show
you is you grab a button,

104
00:05:51.593 --> 00:05:55.473
I'll grab the primary button.

105
00:05:55.473 --> 00:05:59.773
And you'll notice that when I'm
dragging this primary button,

106
00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:04.006
it will actually let me swap it
out with a different one, right?

107
00:06:04.006 --> 00:06:07.723
And basically, I could actually swap
it out with any component the same way

108
00:06:07.723 --> 00:06:09.493
I could do it with that icon before,

109
00:06:09.493 --> 00:06:13.272
but it will use the organization be like,
yeah, this is on the button page.

110
00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:19.058
So, why do you want to swap this button
out with a more different button, right?

111
00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:19.741
You can do that.

112
00:06:19.741 --> 00:06:22.203
The ghost button is one that
doesn't look like a button.

113
00:06:22.203 --> 00:06:26.389
I don't make the rules, I just took
what we did in our app and reapplied it.

114
00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:32.662
You swap it out to primary, I can swap
it out to a destructive button as well,

115
00:06:32.662 --> 00:06:37.083
and I can switch it between
those different buttons.

116
00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:39.735
So that's one variation on a button,
right?

117
00:06:39.735 --> 00:06:42.030
It's all the different kinds of and
you know there's more button.

118
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.811
There's like rounded
button in some places.

119
00:06:43.811 --> 00:06:47.018
There's links that are technically
look like buttons but

120
00:06:47.018 --> 00:06:49.446
they're really a link H anchor text hrefs.

121
00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:50.588
It's a mess.

122
00:06:50.588 --> 00:06:52.295
Lots and lots of buttons.

123
00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:55.946
There's buttons inside of input
fields as buttons all over the place.

124
00:06:55.946 --> 00:06:58.172
But not only are there
all sorts of buttons, but

125
00:06:58.172 --> 00:07:00.185
those buttons can be in different states.

126
00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:02.181
That button could be hovered over.

127
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:07.128
That button could be currently pressed on
an active, that button could be disabled.

128
00:07:07.128 --> 00:07:09.311
That's probably other states
the button could be in.

129
00:07:09.311 --> 00:07:16.403
So if we wanted to, let's say,
create all those various things.

130
00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:20.666
So I would say I would make a different
component that is very similar for

131
00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:24.433
your destructive, your primary,
your secondary buttons and

132
00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:26.435
style them the way that you want.

133
00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:29.909
They used to be a bunch of hacks, like
using one base component that you don't

134
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:31.841
use as the prototype for all your buttons.

135
00:07:31.841 --> 00:07:34.806
So if you change the border
radius on one of the buttons,

136
00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:36.329
it would affect all of them.

137
00:07:36.329 --> 00:07:40.843
Now we have variables, so I would just
store those values in a variable unless

138
00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:42.933
it's something you truly can't.

139
00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:47.468
But, you can create multiple buttons, but
then the idea of a variant I would only

140
00:07:47.468 --> 00:07:50.820
be like, no, this is a different
state of the same button.

141
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:55.002
So cause otherwise you end up with
a variant list that is like really gnarly

142
00:07:55.002 --> 00:07:56.085
and complicated.

143
00:07:56.085 --> 00:07:59.452
If it is both the difference
between the primary, secondary,

144
00:07:59.452 --> 00:08:03.148
destructive button and then also
the hover and act of state, right?

145
00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.469
It's unwieldy.

146
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:05.495
I've tried it.

147
00:08:05.495 --> 00:08:06.241
It's not great.

148
00:08:06.241 --> 00:08:08.115
And it also there's a lot of limitations.

149
00:08:08.115 --> 00:08:12.413
You make a different component for
each one you use the ability to swap out

150
00:08:12.413 --> 00:08:16.998
components and instant swap to switch
between the different components your

151
00:08:16.998 --> 00:08:21.608
variants are for, like the different
states, hover, active, disabled.

152
00:08:21.608 --> 00:08:25.638
Even disabled I might switch to
a different button cause I've done it both

153
00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:28.567
ways and I always regret
using disabled as a variant.

154
00:08:28.567 --> 00:08:29.828
Cool.

155
00:08:29.828 --> 00:08:34.626
So, I can either start out with
the different styles of buttons like I

156
00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:35.463
have here.

157
00:08:35.463 --> 00:08:40.132
And I can design them all just by
duplicating and changing the parts I want.

158
00:08:40.132 --> 00:08:43.781
If I already have the component I
can hit this button right here,

159
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:45.075
which is add variant.

160
00:08:45.075 --> 00:08:48.607
Right now I have two buttons, right?

161
00:08:48.607 --> 00:08:51.008
It's called property one and variant one.

162
00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:56.892
So for instance, we could rename
this state and variant two,

163
00:08:56.892 --> 00:09:02.450
we're gonna call hover and
variant one default is great.

164
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:07.364
So then what we can do is we can go ahead
and change something about this one.

165
00:09:07.364 --> 00:09:12.104
So let's say that when they hover over it,

166
00:09:12.104 --> 00:09:18.830
we're gonna change the fill
to be slightly darker, right?

167
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.424
So this is one button but

168
00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:26.749
if I drag one of these in now.

169
00:09:26.749 --> 00:09:30.899
You can see that I've got
the property like the show icon,

170
00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:32.768
stuff that we had before.

171
00:09:32.768 --> 00:09:36.786
And then I also have default and
hover, right?

172
00:09:36.786 --> 00:09:40.879
And again, that's one button in
the various states that it can be in.

173
00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:45.586
And so that's typically
where you use the variance.

174
00:09:45.586 --> 00:09:49.546
It's really it's a fine art of like,
do you want to be able to like where

175
00:09:49.546 --> 00:09:53.445
the component property so for
instance, an input field is required.

176
00:09:53.445 --> 00:09:55.397
I wanna show a little red dot next to it.

177
00:09:55.397 --> 00:09:59.427
Maybe I'll make that a component property
of showing and hiding the red dot but

178
00:09:59.427 --> 00:10:00.710
like, theoretically,

179
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:04.206
I wouldn't try to say a variant of
a text input is that number input.

180
00:10:04.206 --> 00:10:05.621
I would make those separate.

181
00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:10.470
Distinct things that you would
implement in code differently should be

182
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:13.540
distinct components,
but the hover state or

183
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.496
the active focus state of an input
field or button are variants thereof.

184
00:10:18.496 --> 00:10:23.171
And then what's kind of cool about this is
then you can then make them interactive

185
00:10:23.171 --> 00:10:25.385
and that's useful for prototyping.

186
00:10:25.385 --> 00:10:28.466
So like theoretically no one's
gonna put a button in a hover state

187
00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:29.704
in their design, right?

188
00:10:29.704 --> 00:10:32.632
And then you so
like then why would we even do this?

189
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:38.901
Where it becomes kind of powerful is if
you switch this over to the prototype tab.

190
00:10:38.901 --> 00:10:41.838
You can go to interactions.

191
00:10:41.838 --> 00:10:44.689
And you can say,

192
00:10:44.689 --> 00:10:49.581
let's see while hovering.

193
00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:51.476
Change it to the hover state.

194
00:10:51.476 --> 00:10:54.953
So now if this component is
using any prototypes, right?

195
00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:57.902
And someone hovers over
a button component,

196
00:10:57.902 --> 00:11:00.159
do you know what's gonna happen?

197
00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:03.350
It's gonna switch to the variant
that is the hover state, right?

198
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.010
So you get the idea we can start
to simulate and get a feel for

199
00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:06.886
all these things.

200
00:11:06.886 --> 00:11:09.473
We'll look at prototyping at the very end,
but

201
00:11:09.473 --> 00:11:12.005
it kinda gives you some
of the initial pieces.

202
00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:16.422
One kind of, we won't do it now, but
I'll give it as an exercise for you later.

203
00:11:16.422 --> 00:11:18.713
Like at home, at homework, if you will.

204
00:11:18.713 --> 00:11:22.546
Is like you can do that like
having a checkbox of unchecked and

205
00:11:22.546 --> 00:11:26.167
checked, right you can create
interaction as unclick.

206
00:11:26.167 --> 00:11:30.450
Switch it from the unchecked state
to the checked state, right?

207
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.142
All of those kinds of various things that
you might seek to do like you can't build

208
00:11:35.142 --> 00:11:38.816
a full UI and figure it out but
again, like it's super useful.

209
00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:43.626
For the product manager and designer to
then go to customers validated design

210
00:11:43.626 --> 00:11:48.513
before you ask for API's that you don't
actually need from the back end team.

211
00:11:48.513 --> 00:11:51.221
And before you spend all that
work building just to redo it,

212
00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:53.995
you can create a pretty like,
we'll see one at the very end.

213
00:11:53.995 --> 00:11:58.226
You can create a pretty compelling
prototype using figma prototypes, but

214
00:11:58.226 --> 00:12:01.196
we can create some of these
basic status variables.

215
00:12:01.196 --> 00:12:02.510
But I will say that for

216
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.683
the most part, you'll notice that
I still have one button in here.

217
00:12:06.683 --> 00:12:07.453
Right?
And so

218
00:12:07.453 --> 00:12:09.791
if I decided no,
I don't believe you, Steve.

219
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:14.606
I wanna make the secondary button and
the destructive button and

220
00:12:14.606 --> 00:12:16.756
all those things variants.

221
00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:17.365
Cool.

222
00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:19.458
Get ready drag we'll see one button here,

223
00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:23.296
drag it in and have to click to change the
state every time and good luck wiring up

224
00:12:23.296 --> 00:12:27.274
all those interactive activities,
like interactive pieces of the component.

225
00:12:27.274 --> 00:12:30.729
It's going to be very hard for
you and it's probably not worth it.

226
00:12:30.729 --> 00:12:35.948
So while it might feel bad to have
a bunch of components that look the same,

227
00:12:35.948 --> 00:12:38.740
like Figma is kind of like ergonomics.

228
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:43.092
Definitely set you up for because I
look having a bunch of different buttons

229
00:12:43.092 --> 00:12:46.003
even like I didn't want to hit,
I got real bored.

230
00:12:46.003 --> 00:12:49.300
Even hitting that toggle to show or
not show an icon, right?

231
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.158
It became a lot easier at a certain point
to just dragging a button that has an icon

232
00:12:53.158 --> 00:12:55.707
and then instance swap it out for
one that doesn't.

233
00:12:55.707 --> 00:12:58.187
It's a little hard to make large
scale changes to all the buttons.

234
00:12:58.187 --> 00:13:00.872
Yes.
But if you're using enough variables and

235
00:13:00.872 --> 00:13:04.347
stuff like that, or you're really
fancy with your select all and

236
00:13:04.347 --> 00:13:07.144
renaming and stuff like that,
you can make it work.

237
00:13:07.144 --> 00:13:10.533
And that's typically what we ended up
doing even though we started down the path

238
00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:13.074
of trying to overload variance
with everything possible.

239
00:13:13.074 --> 00:13:16.572
So my advice to you is use them for
the simplest possible thing,

240
00:13:16.572 --> 00:13:19.285
the more components you have and
you can search.

241
00:13:19.285 --> 00:13:21.579
Naming is very important here,
but then it's easier.

242
00:13:21.579 --> 00:13:22.253
Just drag in.

243
00:13:22.253 --> 00:13:24.824
Like, could I have made this
a bunch of different variants?

244
00:13:24.824 --> 00:13:26.148
I could have.

245
00:13:26.148 --> 00:13:26.947
Did I.

246
00:13:26.947 --> 00:13:28.897
At one point in my life, I did.

247
00:13:28.897 --> 00:13:29.985
Did I regret it?

248
00:13:29.985 --> 00:13:30.931
I did.

249
00:13:30.931 --> 00:13:31.942
Right.

250
00:13:31.942 --> 00:13:35.330
So just having a bunch and then kind of
doing the changes that you need to do.

251
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.585
Before variables,

252
00:13:36.585 --> 00:13:40.878
you can make argument that it was
easier to just change those states.

253
00:13:40.878 --> 00:13:45.985
I think after variables, just having
those things defined in variables and

254
00:13:45.985 --> 00:13:48.148
tweaking those is a lot easier.
