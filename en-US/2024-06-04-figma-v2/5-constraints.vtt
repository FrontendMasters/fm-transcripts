00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.056
Now let's actually learn how to do
some layouts and fun stuff like that.

2
00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:07.055
Let's talk about constraints.

3
00:00:07.055 --> 00:00:10.690
Constraints are not just
the deadline is in two weeks and

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.809
it's easily six weeks worth of work,
so let's not write unit tests, right?

5
00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.816
That is one set of constraints.

6
00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:22.532
These are constraints in terms
of like how your layout works.

7
00:00:22.532 --> 00:00:28.441
By default, things are,
if you make a new frame,

8
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:34.226
the constraints are to the top and
left, right?

9
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:39.000
And so if I look at these,
you can say top and left.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.347
So what does that mean?

11
00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:45.290
Well, it means that if I grab
this corner and I drag it,

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.480
they stay to the top and
to the left, which is,

13
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.145
that's what you want, that's great.

14
00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:57.879
If it's not what you want,
that's frustrating, right?

15
00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.638
Especially, that's not really how
the web works a lot of times.

16
00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:07.492
Yeah, if you just have like a div
with some absolute width and height,

17
00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:13.026
you can change the browser window and it
will stay to the top of the left, great.

18
00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:16.461
But if you have something like a nav bar,

19
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:21.423
you might want that to,
stretch with the browser window.

20
00:01:21.423 --> 00:01:25.800
A sidebar, white stretch with the browser
window, a lot of vertical axes.

21
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.533
We would like to do a lot of
the stuff the same way so

22
00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.736
that when we're kind of working
on responsive designs or

23
00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:35.292
just our general sanity,
we can have the same things in place.

24
00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:41.727
And so that's kind of what we use
constraints for in this example, right?

25
00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:46.691
And so let's grab, so I don't have to
change a whole bunch of stuff at once.

26
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:49.606
Let's take a look at
this very simple example.

27
00:01:49.606 --> 00:01:55.326
Here we've got a box, and
if we look the constraints at the top and

28
00:01:55.326 --> 00:02:00.632
left, it will do exactly what
we saw before, and we, cool.

29
00:02:00.632 --> 00:02:05.376
So what happens, however, if I put
it hypothetically in the center, and

30
00:02:05.376 --> 00:02:08.987
I always want it to be in the center,
that's it's job.

31
00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:13.551
Maybe I'm making the world's
worst radio button, right?

32
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:17.366
I would like the little dot in the radio
button to be in the center, right?

33
00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.558
And so if I resize the thing,
that is arguably not what I want.

34
00:02:20.558 --> 00:02:23.963
Could I then also resize the box in
the middle or could I recenter it?

35
00:02:23.963 --> 00:02:29.144
I could, but you can imagine that
doing that at scale is going to,

36
00:02:29.144 --> 00:02:32.552
make you not want to do it anymore, right?

37
00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.319
It's gonna make you want to go outside and
do something else.

38
00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.728
So, let's actually just
adjust the constraints and

39
00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:41.692
get a sense of how all this might work,
right?

40
00:02:41.692 --> 00:02:44.128
So we can grab this,
let's put it back in the center.

41
00:02:44.128 --> 00:02:49.353
If I change the constraints to Center and
Center, right,

42
00:02:49.353 --> 00:02:55.231
and I grab this frame, hey,
it's doing what I want now, right?

43
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:58.974
Similarly, if I do it to the right,
let's say if I was building this toolbar,

44
00:02:58.974 --> 00:03:02.549
some of these I would want constrained
to the right, some of these I'd have

45
00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.798
constrained to the center, some of these I
would have constrained to the left, right?

46
00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:09.164
And so that if this expander contracted,

47
00:03:09.164 --> 00:03:13.501
they would all follow whatever bound
they're supposed to follow, right?

48
00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:16.633
The other one is in my world's
worst radio button example,

49
00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:20.218
because when I put in the center,
it looked like a bad radio button.

50
00:03:20.218 --> 00:03:25.447
If I set this to scale, Right,

51
00:03:25.447 --> 00:03:28.627
then I can go ahead and

52
00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:33.766
it will scale with the container.

53
00:03:33.766 --> 00:03:39.970
The other kind of interesting
one that's really useful, Is to,

54
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.849
let's say,
let's make it like a pseudo navbar.

55
00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.780
Up top, Right,

56
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.225
if I do, in this case, we'll say,
Be constrained to the top,

57
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:57.896
cuz you're a navbar now little box,
you're no longer a bad radio button.

58
00:03:57.896 --> 00:04:04.111
And then, four, if I set it to scale,
let's just leave that for a second.

59
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:11.678
That's not, yeah, scales, but really, in
this case, what we want is left and right.

60
00:04:11.678 --> 00:04:14.879
That just happened to work, but
trust me, it's not what we wanted.

61
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.018
So now,
if we make it bigger on a horizontal axis,

62
00:04:19.018 --> 00:04:22.173
it's constrained on both the left and

63
00:04:22.173 --> 00:04:26.525
right so it will grow and
shrink on that axis as well.

64
00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:30.933
And now kind of feels like almost
like the Apple Notes application,

65
00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:33.422
right, or a little notepad, right?

66
00:04:33.422 --> 00:04:36.543
And so depending on what you want to do,

67
00:04:36.543 --> 00:04:40.430
you can see various different options,
right?

68
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.807
And so, we've got something that,

69
00:04:42.807 --> 00:04:47.649
I took the iPhone SE frame here,
what we wanna do is make that work, right?

70
00:04:47.649 --> 00:04:50.883
So we've got this idea of a bottom nav,
a top nav,

71
00:04:50.883 --> 00:04:54.579
future Instagram posts,
something along those lines.

72
00:04:54.579 --> 00:05:01.101
Also here as well, we grabbed this,
you can see that's not responsive.

73
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:03.879
That's not what I want,
as I'm like, adjusting for

74
00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.984
different viewports this is
gonna drive me slowly insane.

75
00:05:06.984 --> 00:05:13.069
What I would like is for
it to be a little bit more like,

76
00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.809
this hidden one down here, right?

77
00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.332
What if I drag it?

78
00:05:19.332 --> 00:05:23.549
Everything kind of grows and
manipulates as we would expect, right?

79
00:05:23.549 --> 00:05:28.539
This makes the designer's life easier and
you'll notice the image shrinks,

80
00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.562
but my sidebar stays the same,
but kind of the,

81
00:05:31.562 --> 00:05:36.874
if the three lines is a hamburger menu,
I've decided that these are street tacos.

82
00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:41.120
So this is a street taco menu, you can see
the bookmarks kinda stay where they're

83
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.563
supposed to go,
everything kind of adjusts.

84
00:05:43.563 --> 00:05:49.732
Even this picture in the middle kinda
fills it out and is bound appropriately.
