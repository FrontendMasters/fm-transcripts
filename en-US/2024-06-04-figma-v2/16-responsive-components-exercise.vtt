00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.442
All right, your job, is there are two
kinds of completed examples here.

2
00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:09.360
You can choose whichever one makes you
happier or you can do your own design.

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.946
You do whatever you want.

4
00:00:10.946 --> 00:00:12.824
But we've got this version,

5
00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:17.259
which is effectively the same or
we've got this other kind of approach

6
00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:21.782
where you can see that the date kinda
goes from horizontal to vertical.

7
00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:24.969
But you get that nice like
the Instagram postcard.

8
00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:28.983
Or if you have your own idea where
you wanna combine the two, go for it.

9
00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:33.283
I did the first one and then decided I
wanna do the second one for fancies.

10
00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:35.789
You can implement your
own design as well or

11
00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.301
you can try out to try
to match one of these.

12
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:42.435
The fun part too is you can
also like peek at them and

13
00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:46.185
take a look as well and
kick the tires on them.

14
00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:53.441
So our mission is let's go with
this one coz this seems more fun.

15
00:00:53.441 --> 00:01:00.225
Unless someone wants to make a strong case
to do the other one, I don't really care.

16
00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:03.098
Let's go for it real quick.

17
00:01:03.098 --> 00:01:09.758
So let's, we'll drag in a hold
option drag some copies around.

18
00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:17.204
The time, the date are different and
yeah let's do,

19
00:01:19.295 --> 00:01:22.514
That, all right, so
what do I wanna do here?

20
00:01:22.514 --> 00:01:27.542
I might actually try to this is
where I get myself in trouble where

21
00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:32.194
I decided to like what if I do
neither plan and just wing it and

22
00:01:32.194 --> 00:01:38.390
try something different where
I kinda want This effect but

23
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.472
I still wanted to go on the side like
this one when I was just having fun.

24
00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:47.972
The date collapses, but it doesn't do,

25
00:01:47.972 --> 00:01:51.976
I want kind of a combination
of the two effects.

26
00:01:51.976 --> 00:01:57.088
Let's see this,
how could this possibly end poorly for me?

27
00:01:57.088 --> 00:02:02.806
So let's play around this, so
I'm thinking this is a frame.

28
00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:09.450
This is already kind of
its own thing as well.

29
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.921
So let's go ahead and then I'm gonna make,

30
00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:20.319
I'm gonna make this a frame as well and

31
00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.943
it's currently 263 and about like,

32
00:02:24.943 --> 00:02:28.623
almost the smallest it can get.

33
00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:31.559
So I'm gonna say that it's,

34
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.731
Make this an auto layout and
we're gonna say

35
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:45.029
that it's mean width is let's say 270,
right?

36
00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:47.971
And so we've got that.

37
00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:56.421
And we'll go ahead,
we'll make that an auto layout.

38
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:05.339
And let's have that one wrap too
with a horizontal gap of 16.

39
00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:10.943
16 looks good and so
at its smallest, does it ever flip?

40
00:03:10.943 --> 00:03:13.091
Doesn't really flip.

41
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:18.975
So you know what we're gonna do,
we're gonna simulate that,

42
00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:22.872
but you're just making the font bigger.

43
00:03:24.782 --> 00:03:29.780
Cool, and so we've got this
frame here that we're gonna say

44
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.687
that it can fill the container so
that it does now flip over.

45
00:03:34.687 --> 00:03:39.728
Like we had in the other one,
and let's say that one,

46
00:03:39.728 --> 00:03:44.658
we wanna center align it,
and we're gonna say it's

47
00:03:44.658 --> 00:03:49.608
auto in this direction and
eight in this direction.

48
00:03:49.608 --> 00:03:52.671
So now if I look at this one,

49
00:03:52.671 --> 00:03:57.743
it'll kind of flip like that as well,
cool.

50
00:03:57.743 --> 00:04:04.178
This let's go wrap this all
in now in auto frame here,

51
00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:10.335
and so give it a frame and
then we will auto frame it.

52
00:04:10.335 --> 00:04:16.186
And we're gonna say that
this one also wraps,

53
00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:19.045
let's say 32 here.

54
00:04:19.045 --> 00:04:24.018
And we'll give this one a min width of,

55
00:04:24.018 --> 00:04:29.444
it should never get
smaller than it is now,

56
00:04:29.444 --> 00:04:34.288
that's the smallest should ever be.

57
00:04:34.288 --> 00:04:39.458
And now let's actually
say that this one does.

58
00:04:41.637 --> 00:04:45.472
Fill its container going that way.

59
00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:52.177
So let's see how close did I get, okay.

60
00:04:55.528 --> 00:05:01.603
All right, I don't hate it.

61
00:05:01.603 --> 00:05:06.598
Now I can't give the entire thing padding,

62
00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:13.763
coz I want that kind of cool effect
right for the border radius.

63
00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:17.974
So at this point we'll only
give this one some padding.

64
00:05:17.974 --> 00:05:22.862
And I mostly think I only care
about it horizontally at first so

65
00:05:22.862 --> 00:05:28.977
let's try that out We can have
questions about whether or

66
00:05:28.977 --> 00:05:34.203
not that's enough padding on that side or
if I should double it.

67
00:05:34.203 --> 00:05:39.079
But like, let's worry about
the responsive pieces rather

68
00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:43.086
than the little things
we can tweak afterwards.

69
00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:48.799
So okay this also needs some
kind of man width of its own So

70
00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:52.110
now I can go big like that and
get smaller as well.

71
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.766
Do I love this added effect that I did?

72
00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:56.264
I don't but it's fine.

73
00:05:56.264 --> 00:06:00.940
Coz it's really easy to fix if I
decide you know what the wrapping

74
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.845
is kind of obnoxious and
I don't wanna do it anymore.

75
00:06:04.845 --> 00:06:09.245
I can go up to this frame and
I can just change it to a column and

76
00:06:09.245 --> 00:06:11.798
it's not that hard to implement.

77
00:06:11.798 --> 00:06:15.255
Here we wanna say,
interesting I don't wanna

78
00:06:15.255 --> 00:06:19.343
add the horizontal padding
again to the entire thing.

79
00:06:20.766 --> 00:06:25.758
And now since this has its own padding,
we can argue

80
00:06:25.758 --> 00:06:30.766
that there shouldn't be a gap at all here,
right?

81
00:06:30.766 --> 00:06:34.760
And maybe, no, what do we think?

82
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.786
I don't like that.

83
00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:42.224
What do we think about this?

84
00:06:45.453 --> 00:06:49.040
I don't know if we like it but
we'll try it.

85
00:06:50.214 --> 00:06:52.486
I don't hate it, it's a design choice.

86
00:06:52.486 --> 00:06:55.798
I don't, we got the point of
the nested layers here, but

87
00:06:55.798 --> 00:06:59.814
like we can kind of get to the point
where we can have that all in place.

88
00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:03.942
So now we'll give this overall
frame a fill of white and

89
00:07:03.942 --> 00:07:08.093
we'll give it those rounded
edges that I like so much.

90
00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:11.823
And let's go ahead and
just give it a drop shadow.

91
00:07:11.823 --> 00:07:15.991
And so now we've got that effect, yeah.

92
00:07:15.991 --> 00:07:19.487
Just-
&gt;&gt; Thinking the clip content.

93
00:07:19.487 --> 00:07:24.639
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it couldn't tell coz
it was like the color was so

94
00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:31.250
close to the background, I had to zoom
in and get a sense there as well.

95
00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.152
So now I've got this cool little
card that maybe the breakpoints need

96
00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:37.927
to change slightly, but

97
00:07:37.927 --> 00:07:43.440
the overall effect is a responsive car
that we can kinda see both ways as well.

98
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.866
And so, it's a super powerful tool for
complicated layouts.
