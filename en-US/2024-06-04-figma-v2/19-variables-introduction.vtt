WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.246
But like I said, for the rest of this time
we're gonna talk about variables which

2
00:00:04.246 --> 00:00:08.005
are kind of a newer still in beta,
so it's not fully feature complete.

3
00:00:08.005 --> 00:00:10.420
They've been out for a year though,
and like they haven't changed.

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.648
So when I say they're in beta,

5
00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:14.737
they're not like, and everything we
talk about could change at any moment.

6
00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:17.254
No, it's like they're in beta
cause they're not done yet.

7
00:00:17.254 --> 00:00:19.674
They could change, but
generally speaking they haven't.

8
00:00:19.674 --> 00:00:21.167
In the year that they've been around.

9
00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:25.228
So I feel other than them
adding new capabilities, so

10
00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:29.210
I feel pretty confident
talking about them, cool.

11
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.314
And with that's called a segue.

12
00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:35.005
So let's talk about variables.

13
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.817
So variables again, this is one of the
things we're explaining this to engineers

14
00:00:39.817 --> 00:00:41.923
becomes shockingly easy, right?

15
00:00:41.923 --> 00:00:45.709
I don't think I really need to opine
too much about what a variable is.

16
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:50.471
It's a value that can reference, yeah,
it's a named value that you can reference

17
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:53.339
some arbitrary value and
use in multiple places.

18
00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.049
If you change it once,
it changes everywhere awesome.

19
00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:01.252
And there are a few kinds of variables,
which I could read

20
00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:07.876
you this nice documentation that I
wrote for you or I could just show you.

21
00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:09.549
So let's do that.

22
00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.581
So we have local styles, and
we also have this local variables and

23
00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:19.210
that opens a nice table for us, right?

24
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.479
Years probably just be called collection,
but I have been creating deleting

25
00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.273
collections in this file hundreds
of times working on this workshop.

26
00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:31.471
So mine's now called collection one.

27
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:32.622
I don't know why.

28
00:01:32.622 --> 00:01:33.873
I don't make the rules around here.

29
00:01:33.873 --> 00:01:40.781
And I have no variables, but
I have a button called create variable.

30
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:43.921
And I can create see, I could have read
you or shown you like the document I wrote

31
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:47.178
which shows the four kinds of variables
but here's the four kinds of variables.

32
00:01:47.178 --> 00:01:51.596
Color, number, string, Boolean.

33
00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:53.416
I don't think any of those
need a lot of explaining.

34
00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:55.629
Those should be constants.

35
00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.283
We all kind of like know
from our life before.

36
00:01:58.283 --> 00:01:59.171
How we use them.

37
00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:00.292
That needs some explaining.

38
00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:01.964
But let's start with color.

39
00:02:01.964 --> 00:02:05.526
Since we saw that before,
I can create a variable.

40
00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:08.458
I can call it, let's call this one white.

41
00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:09.557
That makes sense.

42
00:02:09.557 --> 00:02:15.906
The other thing I can do is I can right
click on it, and I can hit Edit variable.

43
00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:21.129
In here I can change the name I
could change the just by double

44
00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.396
clicking on it too I can change the value
here I can change the opacity and

45
00:02:27.396 --> 00:02:33.375
then I can determine where this
color is allowed to be used, right?

46
00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:37.335
So in this case, it's like
wherever colors are found, right?

47
00:02:37.335 --> 00:02:41.088
But if I want to say, hey,
this is only for text,

48
00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:43.755
right I can scope it just the text.

49
00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:45.211
Can't do that with styles.

50
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:49.377
Or I can say it's just for borders.

51
00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:54.633
You can see that as we're building out
a design system, we could have a variable

52
00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:59.594
called primary border, which is
different than our primary background.

53
00:02:59.594 --> 00:03:02.837
And you don't want somebody to use
because we all get lazy, right?

54
00:03:02.837 --> 00:03:06.189
If want that to be the same purple
as a background, or whatever,

55
00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.875
like you can actually kind
of force good behavior.

56
00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:12.333
So that when you go do all those things
are fine in terms of that one ticket that

57
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:13.319
you're working on.

58
00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.456
It comes when it's time to refactor
the code base that all of your like past

59
00:03:17.456 --> 00:03:18.533
crimes come back.

60
00:03:18.533 --> 00:03:21.751
So we can scope it down to
whatever it ought to be.

61
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:24.559
We can also do this for numbers as well.

62
00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:28.403
And we'll just do like a quick one,
which is like cozy padding.

63
00:03:28.403 --> 00:03:30.984
I will show you better naming
conventions in a second.

64
00:03:30.984 --> 00:03:35.636
But like as I'm just putting random values
in here, I don't have a better idea.

65
00:03:35.636 --> 00:03:38.592
Also, I was used to 8 and 16 a lot, right?

66
00:03:38.592 --> 00:03:42.938
So let's say like eight
is cozy 16 is normal and

67
00:03:42.938 --> 00:03:46.544
32 is like comfortable I don't know.

68
00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:48.126
So we'll say, eight in this case.

69
00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:51.459
And just to show you
the scoping there as well,

70
00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.587
I can scope it to just something we
can use for quarter corner radiuses,

71
00:03:56.587 --> 00:04:00.535
just for width and height,
just for padding, right?

72
00:04:00.535 --> 00:04:05.307
And so where this is important
is that engineering and

73
00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:09.555
design should be collaborating here,
right?

74
00:04:09.555 --> 00:04:14.288
Because ideally you have some kind of
like system in the way you've structured

75
00:04:14.288 --> 00:04:16.809
your CSS or something along those lines.

76
00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:21.324
And to be able to have a common
nomenclature makes everyone's job easier

77
00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:25.699
and again, you can then only assign
these certain values if you want.

78
00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.542
The other really cool thing and
where this becomes powerful and

79
00:04:29.542 --> 00:04:32.816
only if you use dev mode,
which is this color syntax.

80
00:04:32.816 --> 00:04:38.710
And me I care about web,
which is that's a waste of my time, right?

81
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.360
But I could say in this case,
it was eight, I could say,

82
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.337
depending on what I'm doing,
I could say that this is like.

83
00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:56.749
That's a it would be 0.5 RAM, right?

84
00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:01.182
Or, I could say.

85
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:14.117
Right and have it mapped to a CSS
variable, right and so now when I generate

86
00:05:14.117 --> 00:05:20.183
code, I have the CSS variable which yes
I then like have defined eight, right?

87
00:05:20.183 --> 00:05:23.753
But then design decides you know what,
no more cozy eight.

88
00:05:23.753 --> 00:05:24.878
Cozy is now 10.

89
00:05:26.792 --> 00:05:29.315
I just go change the CSS variable,
move on with my life.

90
00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:31.049
So there are lots of ways.

91
00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:35.997
I think for the padding and
stuff like that,

92
00:05:35.997 --> 00:05:38.685
I actually made a tool,

93
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.587
Because making variables one
by one is really obnoxious.

94
00:05:49.587 --> 00:05:52.070
So for all those spacing ones,

95
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.144
you can kind of like this will
just generate one based on a 16.

96
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:02.869
RAM value but this will create an entire
JSON file, all of the variables and

97
00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:05.334
there's a plug in that you
can import them, right?

98
00:06:05.334 --> 00:06:07.376
Because like,
I don't want to deal with this anymore.

99
00:06:07.376 --> 00:06:11.139
You can it's just JSON, you can figure
out all the ways to generate whatever.

100
00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.684
So you do the opposite thing, which is
like, hey, we have a bunch of these values

101
00:06:14.684 --> 00:06:17.051
in our code, write some script,
generate the JSON.

102
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.481
If you download this file,
you can see the structure of it.

103
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:24.144
Took me a morning to stare at it, but you
can do theoretically generate from your

104
00:06:24.144 --> 00:06:27.013
code base CSS variables
the design team can use.

105
00:06:27.013 --> 00:06:31.780
And then we'll look at from Figma how to
generate CSS the same way we did with that

106
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.216
CSS gen plugin before.

107
00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:35.693
We'll see how to do this here as well.

108
00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:40.570
But yeah, this will go ahead and you can
get rid of any values you don't want,

109
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.611
add some new ones, so on and so.

110
00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:43.260
Fourth.

111
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.441
So we can do that also,
as we saw with the colors, right?

112
00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:54.708
So let's pull back up that one
based on UI colors, right?

113
00:06:54.708 --> 00:06:58.007
And so we saw there was a way
to create variables as well.

114
00:06:58.007 --> 00:07:04.391
So let's go ahead and
we'll say that this is our primary or

115
00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:08.430
brand or what have you generate me and

116
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.275
then color guide and create the variables.

117
00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:19.460
This went ahead and created this
right in a place I don't want it.

118
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.861
If I go into local variables.

119
00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:27.634
I made a collection called colors
where I've got primary like

120
00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:31.228
this is really named primary /50, right?

121
00:07:31.228 --> 00:07:36.148
Because like the slash works in variables
the same way just the styles as

122
00:07:36.148 --> 00:07:37.460
a way to organize.

123
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.441
The cool thing though is if you wanted to,
you could like grab a bunch.

124
00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:46.487
You can create a new one group and that
does the slash nomenclature automatically.

125
00:07:46.487 --> 00:07:50.708
So if I call this one light,
you get a little more hierarchy.

126
00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:57.507
I think you only get one or two as well,
but you can theoretically create sections.

127
00:07:57.507 --> 00:08:02.097
But one of the things that's super
interesting that you can do,

128
00:08:02.097 --> 00:08:06.179
let's move that up,
from that 50 back up here, okay?

129
00:08:06.179 --> 00:08:07.626
So I've got that color palette.

130
00:08:07.626 --> 00:08:12.682
And again, this is one generate, you can
do this for all the colors that you need.

131
00:08:12.682 --> 00:08:15.492
And create all those color palettes and
create them as variables.

132
00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:18.108
The web UI is super cool too,

133
00:08:18.108 --> 00:08:24.220
by the way you can put it again you
don't have to use this Tailwind.

134
00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:27.822
I know about it because I use tailwind but
like colors or colors or

135
00:08:27.822 --> 00:08:30.170
hex codes do whatever you want with them.

136
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.472
So you can like take
any color you want and

137
00:08:32.472 --> 00:08:36.150
it will do the whole palette
actually even show you it in action.

138
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:39.546
And then like you can edit it and
like change the color stops and

139
00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:42.103
all sorts of fun stuff like that and
save them.

140
00:08:42.103 --> 00:08:43.298
It's super cool.

141
00:08:43.298 --> 00:08:47.446
And there's other tools for just coming
up with a whole color thing, but

142
00:08:47.446 --> 00:08:48.676
I'm not a designer.

143
00:08:48.676 --> 00:08:50.473
That's a different course for
a different day.
