1
00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:03.929
So you can create a collection
of these variables, and

2
00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.640
then there's this variables to CSS,

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.738
I think that's the one I like the most,
yeah it's ugly, but it works.

4
00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:16.177
So here we can go into colors or
all of them, you can choose for

5
00:00:16.177 --> 00:00:18.800
the spacing, what units you want.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.998
For the colors, what kind of thing things
you want, and you can hit generate.

7
00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:28.624
And it will create a bunch of CSS
variables that are all of those colors,

8
00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:32.107
and that you can then kinda
bring into your code base.

9
00:00:32.107 --> 00:00:34.993
And now if you see that as primary-100,

10
00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:40.068
you can reference that CSS variable and
it will be primary-100, right.

11
00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:45.112
And if you are like, we don't use
CSS variables, there's another

12
00:00:45.112 --> 00:00:50.086
plugin like I use CSS variables for
a trick that I use for dark mode.

13
00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:53.680
We don't use the colors directly,
we'll have one for

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.113
like primary button color, right?

15
00:00:56.113 --> 00:01:00.695
And if they switch into dark mode, I swap
out the values of the CSS variables.

16
00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:04.393
So I don't have to do that ugly tailwind
thing with dark colon all over the place.

17
00:01:04.393 --> 00:01:06.738
And so when you switch to dark mode,
all the values and

18
00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:09.833
CSS variables change in the light
mode colors to the dark mode colors.

19
00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:14.111
And we'll see how to do that and
generate that with figma as well, so

20
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:17.432
I use CSS variables but for
whatever format you use.

21
00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:22.222
Yeah, that will create
a tailwind theme for you, and

22
00:01:22.222 --> 00:01:25.949
there's other ones that do this as well,

23
00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:31.283
if you all use prior to CSS variables,
we use Sass, right?

24
00:01:31.283 --> 00:01:35.190
You can generate the sass variables,
whatever you need to do.

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.367
And that is really easy for that kind
of engineering to design collaboration

26
00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:42.109
because now they're using
consistent values and

27
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.187
you don't ever have to type
in a hex code again, right?

28
00:01:45.187 --> 00:01:50.146
You just basically have the ability
to just generate the primitives

29
00:01:50.146 --> 00:01:53.279
in your code based on the designs, sweet.

30
00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:59.061
So that works for colors, and
then once we have those colors in place,

31
00:01:59.061 --> 00:02:02.202
they become very easy to use, right?

32
00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:06.670
So here we have a frame and I want to
change the fill, I just go to libraries

33
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.727
right and those are the primary
colors that I generated earlier.

34
00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:15.217
And then the accidental color that I made
while I was fighting with those vectors

35
00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:19.855
that I accidentally made for you, now I
can just pick one of these colors, right.

36
00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:22.952
And if I go ahead and
change the variable right,

37
00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:27.459
it will then change everything
that's referencing that variable.

38
00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.897
So now, all of a sudden, mergers and
acquisitions goes through,

39
00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:35.631
we're no longer blue,
our color is now green, great.

40
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:40.027
Just go to the primary colors, change
them out to green, make corporate happy,

41
00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:43.596
act like it took you three months,
and then go do something else.

42
00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:48.841
Go outside and stare at the sun right,
and so those variables become

43
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:54.007
incredibly powerful for that,
and we'll kind of play with them.

44
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:58.392
But there's some like really kind of
sophisticated stuff you can do once you

45
00:02:58.392 --> 00:02:59.568
have them in place.

46
00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:03.870
The other thing we saw before is with
the numbers, I was typing it an 8,

47
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.683
16 border radius I have
been going through.

48
00:03:06.683 --> 00:03:09.629
Because I didn't wanna use them
before I showed them to you, right?

49
00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:15.707
Putting a corner radius of 16 on literally
everything we did this entire time right,

50
00:03:15.707 --> 00:03:19.636
that can be a value of this
is our border radius, right?

51
00:03:19.636 --> 00:03:25.501
One of the things that I would do right,
is I don't care for

52
00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:29.712
the initial colors, what you name them.

53
00:03:29.712 --> 00:03:32.450
There's two schools of thought
I subscribe to one of them,

54
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.317
not everyone agrees with me,
you choose your own adventure.

55
00:03:35.317 --> 00:03:40.278
One is to create a color palette of red,
blue,

56
00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:44.614
yellow green so on and so forth, right?

57
00:03:44.614 --> 00:03:48.675
We're all gonna end up at the same place,
I don't do that,

58
00:03:48.675 --> 00:03:53.564
I'll show you, I have this little
design system, worked as example.

59
00:03:53.564 --> 00:03:59.742
Where instead I have it called,
you can kind of see over here.

60
00:03:59.742 --> 00:04:03.991
So I've got my primary, secondary and

61
00:04:03.991 --> 00:04:07.466
then I have an accent color, but

62
00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:12.747
then I've got information success,
warning,

63
00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:18.439
danger, some, but
they're full color palettes.

64
00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:22.868
Even that because we did
the whole use red and

65
00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:27.186
yellow all through our code base, right?

66
00:04:27.186 --> 00:04:31.468
And then all of a sudden the app that
I work on has workflows that can be in

67
00:04:31.468 --> 00:04:35.114
a status of running, canceled,
terminated, whatever.

68
00:04:35.114 --> 00:04:40.769
Cool, let's say you want to change all
the terminated ones from red to like,

69
00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:46.337
deep orange color, you use BG dash
orange everywhere, good luck, right?

70
00:04:46.337 --> 00:04:52.650
Yeah, and there's so many oranges,
there's nine hundreds plus 50 and

71
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.072
950 so 11 colors,
you might not need every shade, right.

72
00:04:58.072 --> 00:05:01.237
And if you have every shade guess what
it's gonna happen you're gonna use every

73
00:05:01.237 --> 00:05:03.374
shade It right, and
then doing refactoring is hard.

74
00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:08.013
You probably want a smaller set of colors,
but also if I wanna change all the primary

75
00:05:08.013 --> 00:05:11.671
buttons from blue to green,
I can't just change green, right?

76
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:14.015
It'd be better if I had
a reference to hey,

77
00:05:14.015 --> 00:05:16.302
this is the color of our primary buttons.

78
00:05:16.302 --> 00:05:18.877
This is the color of
our secondary buttons,

79
00:05:18.877 --> 00:05:22.085
this is the color of our
destructive buttons, right?

80
00:05:22.085 --> 00:05:28.990
And so what you can do, is you can have
your initial color palette, right?

81
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.338
In fact,
let's go back over to this one and

82
00:05:31.338 --> 00:05:33.761
I'll kinda show you the variables in here.

83
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:38.652
You can have this and you can see that
I've got colors and component colors,

84
00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:40.952
colors is my entire color palette.

85
00:05:40.952 --> 00:05:45.339
What you're gonna do is once you
have this entire color palette,

86
00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:47.660
you're gonna select all of them.

87
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.333
And you're gonna right-click and you're
gonna edit, you're not gonna hit delete,

88
00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:55.823
that's rude, you're gonna hit
hide from publishing, right?

89
00:05:55.823 --> 00:05:58.253
You're gonna have
an entire color palette and

90
00:05:58.253 --> 00:06:01.004
then you're never gonna speak of it again,
right?

91
00:06:01.004 --> 00:06:04.963
What you're gonna do is
if you look over here,

92
00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:09.744
I've got a separate collection
of variables, right?

93
00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:12.596
And you can see if I look at button, so

94
00:06:12.596 --> 00:06:16.834
this is the default color
of a primary button, right?

95
00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:20.291
This is the hover color
of a primary button,

96
00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:25.343
this is the active color,
this is the label of a primary button.

97
00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:30.278
My variables are named for
what they're used for,

98
00:06:30.278 --> 00:06:33.849
and they reference a color, right?

99
00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:38.575
And what this does is create a really
powerful abstraction, if design decides,

100
00:06:38.575 --> 00:06:42.411
yeah, purple still our brand,
but a different purple, right.

101
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:46.008
Then you go ahead and you change their
primary color to a different shade of

102
00:06:46.008 --> 00:06:49.910
purple, everything pointing at that
purple, right then gets the new purple.

103
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.244
If on the other hand,

104
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:56.214
it's just the primary buttons are going
to now point to our blue color instead,

105
00:06:56.214 --> 00:07:00.911
you can go in here and change those and
the designs get that effect, right.

106
00:07:00.911 --> 00:07:04.982
And so
you can do that at any given point by,

107
00:07:04.982 --> 00:07:08.942
let's say in here we'll create a color,

108
00:07:08.942 --> 00:07:13.709
I can put in a hex code,
right, or where'd it go?

109
00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:18.603
If I click on it I can go to libraries,
I can alias it to another color, right?

110
00:07:18.603 --> 00:07:22.683
So if I need to change all the primary
colors from one purple to another purple

111
00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:26.656
cool, and then everything pointing
at primary 500 gets that effect.

112
00:07:26.656 --> 00:07:29.719
If I just need to change
the primary buttons right,

113
00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:32.721
then I can go change those values as well,
right.

114
00:07:32.721 --> 00:07:36.092
And so know that way you're not
actually referencing the real colors,

115
00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:38.407
you're only using the semantic names,
right?

116
00:07:38.407 --> 00:07:41.744
Hey, I don't know like this
aliases to some other color but

117
00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:45.501
this is a primary button it should
be primary button blue, right?

118
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:49.234
And then you can say the same thing
like input fields are the worst, right?

119
00:07:49.234 --> 00:07:51.300
Because you want all your input
fields look the same, but

120
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.076
one knows that there's
not just an input field.

121
00:07:53.076 --> 00:07:57.584
There's an input field, there's a text
area, there's a select right, and

122
00:07:57.584 --> 00:07:59.785
they all should look kind of the same.

123
00:07:59.785 --> 00:08:02.277
So you can have the semantic
values point there and

124
00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:04.419
then that point Points to a color, right?

125
00:08:04.419 --> 00:08:09.582
The same works here where I've got tokens,
which are just a very curated set because

126
00:08:09.582 --> 00:08:14.249
I don't need that many sizes of rounded
borders in my application, right?

127
00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:17.777
I say that as somebody who has an
application with that many rounded borders

128
00:08:17.777 --> 00:08:19.460
and now needs to go undo it, right?

129
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:25.042
Some of this is like referenced
by holes that I've dug for

130
00:08:25.042 --> 00:08:29.231
myself but
these are the overall tokens but

131
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:35.182
then that means for a button label or
input padding, right.

132
00:08:35.182 --> 00:08:39.755
Now if I want to change all of the inputs,
I changed what this variable points to.

133
00:08:39.755 --> 00:08:43.993
Or if I changed my entire spacing system
to be based on 16 point equals one ram to

134
00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:47.047
something else,
I can change those underlying tokens.

135
00:08:47.047 --> 00:08:52.257
So you can have variables point other
variables, and then what you would do is

136
00:08:52.257 --> 00:08:57.881
when you did either the variables to CSS
or whatever plugin makes you the happiest.

137
00:08:57.881 --> 00:09:02.424
This one seems fine to me,
you do if you just run it,

138
00:09:02.424 --> 00:09:06.677
let's say component colors and
hit generate.

139
00:09:06.677 --> 00:09:11.862
It does point at these CSS variables,
which means I would

140
00:09:11.862 --> 00:09:18.684
have to have those CSS variables exposed
in my code or I hit Ignore aliases.

141
00:09:18.684 --> 00:09:22.457
And now,
my CSS variables are the hex codes, but

142
00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:26.242
they are pointed to one source of truth,
right?

143
00:09:26.242 --> 00:09:30.165
Hey, I don't this is just
an alert danger background,

144
00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:34.428
those values are generated
from the design system, right.

145
00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:39.204
If the designer has changed your mind,
generate me a new one of these CSS

146
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:44.393
variables, I drop it in, I act like it
took me a week and I go shop for guitars.

147
00:09:44.393 --> 00:09:49.480
Now, how do we actually use
the variables for various things?

148
00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.021
That's a great question, I'm glad that you
all thought it with your minds, let's see,

149
00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:55.291
do I have some variable?

150
00:09:55.291 --> 00:10:00.444
I've got this cozy padding,
that's scoped to I think everything

151
00:10:00.444 --> 00:10:04.872
at this point, you can just
see places that we can use it.

152
00:10:04.872 --> 00:10:09.488
So draw a frame and the colors we saw,
it's just in libraries but

153
00:10:09.488 --> 00:10:13.250
what's super interesting
is now in a lot of places,

154
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.686
you will see this funny little,
like Hexagon.

155
00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:20.756
And hexagon, as we all know,
means code right,

156
00:10:20.756 --> 00:10:24.145
blame node js, I don't make the rules.

157
00:10:24.145 --> 00:10:27.871
So now you can see that I can
just instead of putting 8 or 16,

158
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:32.046
I can put a reference, now the name
of this variable is problematic.

159
00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:37.168
But I could put a reference to this value,
and then that eight will be in there.

160
00:10:37.168 --> 00:10:42.067
And if I change the variable, everything
like that references that border radius

161
00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:45.555
in this case,
light will change to the new value, right?

162
00:10:45.555 --> 00:10:48.014
Great for designers, great for us right,

163
00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:51.920
because we're generating code
based on those variables, right.

164
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:57.147
And so our code just yeah, we just
dumped in the new variable values and

165
00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:59.635
ideally your UI changes as well.

166
00:10:59.635 --> 00:11:03.054
There are some places where it's not as
obvious I'm trying to think of one off

167
00:11:03.054 --> 00:11:03.904
the top of my head.

168
00:11:03.904 --> 00:11:08.033
There are some places where you have
to right-click on the thing and

169
00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:12.814
then you'll see apply variable, so
sometimes you'll see a little diamond,

170
00:11:12.814 --> 00:11:14.422
we'll find it together.

171
00:11:14.422 --> 00:11:18.672
I think stroke is one,
stroke you don't see the diamond, but

172
00:11:18.672 --> 00:11:20.649
you got to right click on it.

173
00:11:20.649 --> 00:11:26.009
Come on, you hit apply variable right,
and there it is, I don't make the rules,

174
00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:31.153
I don't design these things,
sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not.

175
00:11:31.153 --> 00:11:34.969
There are some limitations,
the colors only work for single colors,

176
00:11:34.969 --> 00:11:38.979
if you alias are variable,
you can't be that variable 50% opacity not

177
00:11:38.979 --> 00:11:42.098
gonna happen,
great against is still gotta use styles.

178
00:11:42.098 --> 00:11:44.827
There's a lot of stuff you
still gotta use styles for

179
00:11:44.827 --> 00:11:47.068
where they work they're super powerful.
