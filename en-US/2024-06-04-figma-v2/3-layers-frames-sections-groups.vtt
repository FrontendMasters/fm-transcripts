1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.666
So, then we got this idea of frames,
which I've mentioned a bunch, but

2
00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:08.240
we should probably deal with and
talk about in earnest.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.988
So, there are a bunch of
ways of grouping things.

4
00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:15.268
Three of the major ones
are this idea of frames,

5
00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:21.178
which is most of what we're going to use
today, then we've got sections and groups.

6
00:00:21.178 --> 00:00:24.814
Since frames are the most important,
let's talk about the other two.

7
00:00:24.814 --> 00:00:28.799
Sections are actually a relatively
new thing, that's this over here,

8
00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:31.294
they are mostly just for
organizing things.

9
00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:34.609
In terms of like when you have
a whole bunch of components and

10
00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:36.995
how they get laid out
in that Assets panel,

11
00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:40.790
stuff like sections will add certain
levels of hierarchy in there.

12
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.325
Other than that, they don't really do
anything but have this fun little button

13
00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:48.925
here, where you can market
something ready for development.

14
00:00:48.925 --> 00:00:52.556
We started on our design
system before that existed, so

15
00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:55.267
we use a very sophisticated set of emoji.

16
00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:58.137
But this also work as well.

17
00:00:58.137 --> 00:01:00.091
It can remove the ready status.

18
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:03.254
The other one is Groups,
Groups don't do anything but

19
00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:07.188
they kind of like collect a whole
bunch of random objects together.

20
00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:09.611
A lot of times I will use,
it's really hard for

21
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:11.987
me to remember the times
I always use Groups.

22
00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:13.321
I use groups when I need them.

23
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:16.513
Like, I have some buttons for a website
that have like stars that explode.

24
00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:22.179
So that star thing, which is a bunch of
smaller vectors, needs to be dealt with.

25
00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.805
As like a group, but the other place
where I find myself using it a lot is

26
00:01:26.805 --> 00:01:30.423
think about some of that
aligning that we saw earlier.

27
00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:34.892
Let's say I wanted to keep this kind of
even grid, but I wanted to move the group

28
00:01:34.892 --> 00:01:39.225
up, look pun unintended,
I could theoretically, a lot of times I'll

29
00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:43.518
make a short group, like, just a short
live group where I'll group them.

30
00:01:43.518 --> 00:01:46.491
So now I can kind of move them together,
cuz if I just said,

31
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:50.926
hey, align to the baseline, all six icons
would shoot up and they'd be overlapping,

32
00:01:50.926 --> 00:01:52.239
which is not what I want.

33
00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:55.087
I want the top of this group
to align with the other two.

34
00:01:55.087 --> 00:02:00.189
So if I put them in a group, we get this,

35
00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.901
if they were not in a group and

36
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:08.099
we did that, we will get chaos.

37
00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:08.969
That's not what I want.

38
00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:13.351
So groups are just helpful at times for
arranging stuff as well.

39
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:18.813
So sections organizing groups, don't do
anything except like keep stuff together.

40
00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:20.685
When you need it,
you will know that you need it.

41
00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:22.916
Groups are not a unique feature to Figma,

42
00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:25.735
you've probably seen
something like this before.

43
00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:29.416
Frames are the more interesting ones.

44
00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:34.071
You can think about a frame as anytime
that you would've grabbed a div

45
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:38.340
section article,
pick your favorite semantic HTML element.

46
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.712
And then you would grab one of those is
probably a time you would need a frame.

47
00:02:41.712 --> 00:02:45.178
If you wanna use stuff like layout
grids or constraints or auto layout or

48
00:02:45.178 --> 00:02:49.336
a whole bunch stuff that I'm going to talk
about that I haven't explained to you yet,

49
00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:51.615
that a lot of this is
only supported in frames.

50
00:02:51.615 --> 00:02:53.088
Components are based on frames.

51
00:02:53.088 --> 00:02:57.136
Frames are like kind of
the normal name of the game for

52
00:02:57.136 --> 00:03:00.455
the pieces of our design
that we might use.

53
00:03:00.455 --> 00:03:04.068
And there's a lot of different options,
you can always, at any given point, hit F.

54
00:03:04.068 --> 00:03:06.491
If you click, you draw 100 by 100.

55
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:09.310
Hit F and draw a square, that works too.

56
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.111
You also notice that when I just hit
the F key, I get some pre-sized frames,

57
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:18.323
which are really useful at the very
end when we get to prototyping.

58
00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:22.993
You've got everything from
various different phones,

59
00:03:22.993 --> 00:03:28.837
to presentations, to watch,
to paper sizes, to Twitter post sizes.

60
00:03:28.837 --> 00:03:31.374
Think those are mostly
the open graph sizes,

61
00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:34.454
which unfortunately I know
from memory at this point.

62
00:03:34.454 --> 00:03:36.814
So on and so forth, right?

63
00:03:36.814 --> 00:03:39.411
And those frames kind of just, again,

64
00:03:39.411 --> 00:03:43.829
they are the component pieces to
have almost everything in Figma.

65
00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.890
One or two last things to take a look
at is this clip content button,

66
00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.397
it just shows or hide things that
exceed the bounds of the frame itself.

67
00:03:56.397 --> 00:03:59.285
So like obviously this is
what I'm trying to implement.

68
00:03:59.285 --> 00:04:03.988
But if I needed to, if something was
off the page, I need to grab the end,

69
00:04:03.988 --> 00:04:05.854
I can toggle that on and off.

70
00:04:05.854 --> 00:04:10.850
Lastly, when we change the size of
our frame, you'll see that it changes

71
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.962
the frame, but depending on how
you set up the constraints,

72
00:04:14.962 --> 00:04:17.231
everything in it stays the same.

73
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:22.229
And that is one of the core differences
between the idea of changing the bounds of

74
00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.894
a frame and that, like,
the move tool and the scale tool.

75
00:04:25.894 --> 00:04:30.216
If I grab the scale tool with the K
letter, you'll actually see I can and

76
00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:33.830
big in it or in small in it,
which are very technical terms.

77
00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.301
And those are available for me as well.
