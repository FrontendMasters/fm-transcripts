00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:03.134
Question about colors,
especially color variables.

2
00:00:03.134 --> 00:00:05.049
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I'm always messing with hex,

3
00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.493
normally hex values, but

4
00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:09.785
then every once in a while I
wanna use the same color scheme.

5
00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:14.983
I wanna use an RGBA and
ltrying to match those up and not just

6
00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:21.892
paste in some RGBA that is hard coded
instead of matching the color scheme in.

7
00:00:21.892 --> 00:00:25.188
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the Export Tools you can
choose various different formats.

8
00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:30.164
I really like HSL because it's very
easy to keep consistent, like shade and

9
00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:33.520
lightness, of course,
different hues, right?

10
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.139
And so for that, a lot of times I'll
just use the tools in the Export, right?

11
00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:41.873
In Figma itself,
it shockingly doesn't care,

12
00:00:41.873 --> 00:00:46.071
right, insofar that we
don't need version history.

13
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:47.892
Show me the button.

14
00:00:47.892 --> 00:00:51.992
If I go into this style,
for instance, right?

15
00:00:51.992 --> 00:00:58.995
No, where is my little,
I think I gotta go into the variables now.

16
00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:02.500
Styles, you can hit the little things
variables, you have to go in here.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.183
Back to my base colors.

18
00:01:08.183 --> 00:01:09.472
That was a lot of work.

19
00:01:09.472 --> 00:01:12.844
The cool part in Figma is that they're
all effectively the same thing, right?

20
00:01:12.844 --> 00:01:16.784
So it's currently set to HSL because
that's what I was using last.

21
00:01:16.784 --> 00:01:19.666
But you can see that in the variable
table there, hex, right?

22
00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:25.201
And so, in Figma, you can very cleanly
swing, and you actually get the CSS value.

23
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.956
But I a lot of times like this
because I can do different hues.

24
00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:32.791
Like somebody mentioned in the chat
earlier, Figma doesn't care but

25
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:35.597
then it becomes the,
how do you export it, right?

26
00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:38.791
And the nice part is if
those colors are generated,

27
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.773
you all of a sudden do tend to care less,
right?

28
00:01:41.773 --> 00:01:46.883
And so one of the things that you
can do with CSS variables is you

29
00:01:46.883 --> 00:01:51.992
can write your CSS variable in
such a way that it's a little bit

30
00:01:51.992 --> 00:01:57.609
different than the RGBA or
RGB syntax, it's spaces between them.

31
00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.428
But you can write a CSS variable which
is like those first three values, and

32
00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:07.033
then allowing you to pass in different
opacities for the RGBA, right?

33
00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.399
So some of that you can do with code,
which is like, hey, and

34
00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.700
you can build the variables,
like we've got this red, and

35
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.289
then we have a fourth
value that we can pass in.

36
00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:21.178
And then I no longer think about the RGB
part, it's just the A in that case.

37
00:02:21.178 --> 00:02:23.044
Thank you all so much.

38
00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:25.822
Whoa, thank you so much!

39
00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:28.773
