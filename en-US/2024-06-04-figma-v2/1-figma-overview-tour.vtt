00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.899
Everything I'm gonna cover and arguably
more than I'm gonna cover today is in

2
00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.034
this course website where there is
everything we'll talk about and

3
00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:11.952
then a bunch of stuff
where I wrote the content.

4
00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:15.548
But then some of it is kind
of the extended cut is

5
00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:20.447
in this course website here where
you can kind of follow along.

6
00:00:20.447 --> 00:00:24.802
And for a lot of this stuff, if you saw me
do something real quick, there might be

7
00:00:24.802 --> 00:00:28.774
like an animated GIF, or at least some
prose kind of like explaining it.

8
00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:32.010
Or if you need it
reinforced in another way,

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.077
all of this is kind of
written out as well.

10
00:00:35.077 --> 00:00:40.386
But more importantly, we have this project
file that we're going to work through.

11
00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:45.266
I'm gonna make a fork of it to try to
leave the initial one into a clean state.

12
00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:49.864
So when someone watches this later, they
kind of see exactly where we started from,

13
00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:52.926
not where I drew random buttons and
did stuff like that.

14
00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:55.845
But you can also hit open in Figma and

15
00:00:55.845 --> 00:01:01.002
you will get kind of your own fourth
that you can follow along and

16
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:06.861
play along with as well, and then see
what I'm doing in my file as well.

17
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:12.639
So, with that, let's take a tour
of Figma as it was all about.

18
00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:20.542
So mostly, like most of what's happening
in Figma is kind of on three sides, right?

19
00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:22.646
Along the top we have this toolbar,

20
00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:25.952
which has a lot of the very
basic tools that we might use.

21
00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:30.725
You'll notice that for a lot of these
things, either there's a carrot and

22
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:36.056
a menu, or it's a one one piece thing that
has a little like letter that you can hit.

23
00:01:36.056 --> 00:01:40.054
And so this is if you ever use like
something like Final Cut Pro or

24
00:01:40.054 --> 00:01:45.033
Photoshop or some other tools, you can
switch tools just by hitting K to switch

25
00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:49.194
to the Scale tool or vi to switch to
the Move tool so on and so forth.

26
00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:52.820
The nice part is you can
kind of see what those

27
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.842
shortcuts are just by
hovering over the things.

28
00:01:56.842 --> 00:02:00.473
I will use some of
the really common shortcuts.

29
00:02:00.473 --> 00:02:05.983
I will try not to use a lot of esoteric
ones because it is a lot easier for

30
00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:11.873
you to follow my mouse than it is for
you to magically know what like I did for

31
00:02:11.873 --> 00:02:17.484
muscle memory in some kind of like
code to make a certain thing happen.

32
00:02:17.484 --> 00:02:21.562
So generally speaking you know if for
the very common things, I will say, and

33
00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:25.391
I will sometimes slip up because some
of this is muscle memory after doing

34
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:26.549
it a thousand times.

35
00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.141
But generally speaking, there are keyboard
shortcuts for literally everything.

36
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:35.676
So we've got the keyboard shortcuts for
all of these tools.

37
00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:37.986
This menu here is the Figma menu.

38
00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:42.940
If you are using the desktop application,
you will notice that it has some striking

39
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.937
similarities to what's
going up along top here.

40
00:02:45.937 --> 00:02:49.861
The interesting part about Figma is that
it's theoretically a web app that has

41
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:52.965
a desktop app like most of the stuff
on my computer these days.

42
00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:54.745
It's a web app in a desktop shell.

43
00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:58.194
There's a really great
course called by me.

44
00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:01.671
[LAUGH] you can totally check out
how to build desktop applications.

45
00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:04.215
But that's a different story for
a different day.

46
00:03:04.215 --> 00:03:07.379
There's no expectation you can do this
in the browser you can do in the desktop

47
00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.018
application.

48
00:03:08.018 --> 00:03:12.414
I find in my day to day life that I have
whatever I was working on in desktop

49
00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:17.033
application, and then every random link
I got sent in Slack is usually open

50
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:19.406
in one of my 7000 browser to Tabs.

51
00:03:19.406 --> 00:03:23.699
So, if you're using a desktop app, you've
got all the stuff up and along here.

52
00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:28.488
If you are just in a web app,
all that can also be found here as well.

53
00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:32.232
In the center of the toolbar, and
I'm zoomed in a little bit, but

54
00:03:32.232 --> 00:03:35.102
you'll have a little more
of a separation there.

55
00:03:35.102 --> 00:03:38.205
You will kind of see information about
the file, where you can do stuff.

56
00:03:38.205 --> 00:03:40.015
Stuff like showing the version history,

57
00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:41.936
publish a library if
you're on a paid plan.

58
00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:47.166
There's some branching,
which I think is very much you would see

59
00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:52.123
from Git except no designer has
ever used it in my experience.

60
00:03:52.123 --> 00:03:55.752
Some other file related things.

61
00:03:55.752 --> 00:03:59.818
If you are on a given element, this
changes to some various different, like,

62
00:03:59.818 --> 00:04:04.024
ability to make reusable components or
some other things with that given layer.

63
00:04:04.024 --> 00:04:06.776
But if you're kind of just
in the regular field,

64
00:04:06.776 --> 00:04:09.068
then it's information about the file.

65
00:04:09.068 --> 00:04:11.135
And then to the right of
this top toolbar here,

66
00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:14.328
you have information about your account,
the ability to share a file.

67
00:04:14.328 --> 00:04:17.307
You can do a lot of stuff like you
might see in, like, Google Drive,

68
00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:18.632
share it in view-only mode.

69
00:04:18.632 --> 00:04:21.929
So on and so forth,
there is a lot of like multiplayer,

70
00:04:21.929 --> 00:04:24.023
multiple cursors flying around.

71
00:04:24.023 --> 00:04:27.042
I have that disabled for
all of our Saturdays.

72
00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:30.590
But you can also see all of that as well.

73
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.315
And then just kind of information about
your account like there's ability to chat,

74
00:04:34.315 --> 00:04:35.529
all that kind of fun stuff.

75
00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.434
This is developer mode which is
good gated behind a paid feature.

76
00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:41.719
I happen to have a paid account.

77
00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:45.780
It does stuff like allowing
you to see some of the CSS and

78
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.295
measurements around things as
you're gonna implement it.

79
00:04:50.295 --> 00:04:52.743
It's nice, it's not required.

80
00:04:52.743 --> 00:04:57.557
A lot of what we're gonna talk about
today is some of the strategies around

81
00:04:57.557 --> 00:05:02.140
how you can kind of like structure
your designs should make a lot more of

82
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.331
these concepts easier, right?

83
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:08.387
There's a lot of concepts that map
directly to like Flexbox for instance, and

84
00:05:08.387 --> 00:05:12.022
if you and your design team are using
those, it becomes really clear.

85
00:05:12.022 --> 00:05:16.161
Now grid is totally helpful to see some
of the like Flexbox cheat sheets but

86
00:05:16.161 --> 00:05:19.766
one usually has to kind of take
these as an initial inspiration,

87
00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:24.673
rather than there's nothing really you can
always just copy and paste for most cases.

88
00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:28.943
We have any libraries that we want to
use from our organization, or publishing

89
00:05:28.943 --> 00:05:33.418
this as a library, along with prototyping,
and a bunch of like zooming options.

90
00:05:33.418 --> 00:05:38.326
You can see as I pinch to zoom,
that zoom kind of increases and decreases.

91
00:05:38.326 --> 00:05:40.755
All right, let's turn off dev mode.

92
00:05:40.755 --> 00:05:45.408
Along the side, we have this left panel
that has two major pieces is pages.

93
00:05:45.408 --> 00:05:47.700
So design could have multiple pages.

94
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.734
This might be if you're
doing a component library,

95
00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:52.293
your input fields versus your buttons,
versus something else.

96
00:05:52.293 --> 00:05:56.893
In my case, since I'm using this as kind
of the like, quote, unquote, lesson plan,

97
00:05:56.893 --> 00:06:00.755
agenda is broken out by the different
sections that we're gonna cover.

98
00:06:00.755 --> 00:06:02.517
And then towards the bottom,

99
00:06:02.517 --> 00:06:07.180
you can see all the different layers in
a given page and navigate between them.

100
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.776
You also have your assets, which are gonna
be any kind of like shared components.

101
00:06:11.776 --> 00:06:14.784
Initially in the file,
this will start out as empty for you.

102
00:06:14.784 --> 00:06:18.114
And as we create components that
are reusable, you will see them here.

103
00:06:18.114 --> 00:06:22.088
If your organization has a shared
component library and that they've

104
00:06:22.088 --> 00:06:26.819
published within the org, you'll also see
that shared set of components as well.

105
00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.592
Then over on the right side, this is where
for a given layer that we're playing with,

106
00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:35.328
you'll see all the different
properties that we can manipulate.

107
00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:39.827
Most of the tweaking that you
do will happen in this pane.

108
00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:44.280
And towards the end very briefly,
we'll kind of take a look at the kind

109
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.035
of prototyping interaction design piece
that people a gym can use, are you

110
00:06:49.035 --> 00:06:53.814
to kind of create a working prototype
before you go sit down and write code.

111
00:06:53.814 --> 00:06:58.916
But most of our time is going to actually
be focused on the like building and

112
00:06:58.916 --> 00:07:04.283
structure of design components before
we receive them on the developer end.

113
00:07:04.283 --> 00:07:07.015
And that, there's a few other things.

114
00:07:07.015 --> 00:07:10.590
One, you'll notice if you go to
the Figma menu, there's quick actions,

115
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.824
which is one of those command palettes
like you might see in VS code or

116
00:07:13.824 --> 00:07:15.330
something along those lines.

117
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.554
Where you can just search for
a given menu.

118
00:07:19.554 --> 00:07:23.648
One thing that you'll find in there is
also these keyboard shortcuts, which will

119
00:07:23.648 --> 00:07:27.704
be all the various keyboard shortcuts that
you can learn and memorize over time.

120
00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:32.429
Like I said, I am gonna try
my hardest to avoid too much

121
00:07:32.429 --> 00:07:37.471
keyboard magic because I know
it's hard to follow that.

122
00:07:37.471 --> 00:07:40.551
But over time, if you find yourself
doing something repetitive,

123
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.198
there is probably a keyboard
shortcut to make it easier.

124
00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:46.428
Or sometimes it's like the difference
between holding shift or

125
00:07:46.428 --> 00:07:50.329
command while clicking on a various part
of the UI will be a shortcut, right?

126
00:07:50.329 --> 00:07:51.673
And some of those will find out together.

127
00:07:51.673 --> 00:07:56.748
But for your use cases, there is
probably something that you might see.

128
00:07:56.748 --> 00:08:01.807
For instance, I literally did not know
about hitting double zero to change

129
00:08:01.807 --> 00:08:07.281
the opacity to 0% on a layer until I just
left this tab open while talking to you.

130
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:12.805
And obviously in the middle you have this
canvas here, which is the design itself.

131
00:08:12.805 --> 00:08:17.265
And we will talk a little bit in the very
beginning before we get into components.

132
00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:20.284
Variables and responsive design and
layout grids and

133
00:08:20.284 --> 00:08:23.713
all that fun stuff we're gonna
learn how to click on things.

134
00:08:23.713 --> 00:08:26.225
Right it feels a little but
like eating our vegetables but

135
00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:29.626
it's gonna be good it's gonna be a point
because we'll make our lives easier

136
00:08:29.626 --> 00:08:32.677
as we do some of those more complicated
things later in the workshop.
