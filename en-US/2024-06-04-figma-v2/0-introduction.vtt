00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.994
Hi, my name is Steve and I am the head
of Front Engineering at Temporal.

2
00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:05.888
But we're gonna talk about design today.

3
00:00:05.888 --> 00:00:11.373
Well, we're gonna talk about the
connection between design and engineering.

4
00:00:11.373 --> 00:00:16.206
The origin story of me getting started
with Figma was more of a startup tale,

5
00:00:16.206 --> 00:00:20.660
which is as the first front end engineer
at the startup I work at now that

6
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.606
has a full design team and
a whole front end engineering team.

7
00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:29.227
I kind of inherited some person of
the company is like ideas in Figma

8
00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:31.713
about what the UI should look like.

9
00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:32.286
Right, and

10
00:00:32.286 --> 00:00:35.849
then having to iterate on that, I had
to learn a lot about how Figma works.

11
00:00:35.849 --> 00:00:39.149
And what I figured out was one,
actually it's pretty cool and

12
00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.146
it's an awesome tool and
you should learn how to use it.

13
00:00:42.146 --> 00:00:45.840
But then two, as now we have a full
design team with a head of design and

14
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.392
three product designers and
all those things,

15
00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:51.236
I've got an engineering
team of six people.

16
00:00:51.236 --> 00:00:56.148
But what's super fascinating is that
over time we begin to learn that knowing

17
00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:59.942
how the design tools work and
also what that means for code.

18
00:00:59.942 --> 00:01:02.816
Allows for more collaboration
between the design teams and

19
00:01:02.816 --> 00:01:04.434
the engineering teams, right?

20
00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:07.823
There are ways that
the engineering teams can now, or

21
00:01:07.823 --> 00:01:12.565
my engineering team can help inform
design team like, if we structure

22
00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:17.336
stuff like this, it actually makes our
job of implementing it way easier.

23
00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:21.626
The other interesting thing is as
we'll see in this course is that

24
00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:24.512
there are a bunch of
techniques in figma to,

25
00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:28.022
let's say we have a whole color system or
a spacing and

26
00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:33.253
kind of those design tokens as you hear
in a lot of design systems speak, right?

27
00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:36.069
There are ways to kind of
generate at least not code,

28
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.974
you're never gonna generate a React
component that you can just copy and

29
00:01:39.974 --> 00:01:42.615
paste and move forward with that,
yet at least.

30
00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:46.563
But stuff like generating
all of the CSS variables for

31
00:01:46.563 --> 00:01:50.876
the various colors found
throughout your design system.

32
00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:54.160
There are tools built into figma that
will make your life a lot easier.

33
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.856
The other thing is that a lot of you know
designers will structure things in a way

34
00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:59.148
that makes sense for them.

35
00:01:59.148 --> 00:02:04.745
And helps them work cleanly but like
are ways that once you understand both,

36
00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:10.517
how it works on the whatever whether
it's vanilla JavaScript Reacts Svelte,

37
00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:12.016
what have you side.

38
00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:16.622
And then also hey, but
if we also structured it in this way,

39
00:02:16.622 --> 00:02:22.797
the'll actually translate better when we
go to implement in code, and for a lot

40
00:02:22.797 --> 00:02:28.906
of these things will actually make the
designers in your lives easier as well.

41
00:02:28.906 --> 00:02:31.428
Designs in your lives will
make their lives easier.

42
00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:34.145
And so those things are important as well.

43
00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:38.429
And there's a lot of new functionality
that's come out in the last

44
00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.885
few years in figma wher,
there's a lot of concepts.

45
00:02:41.885 --> 00:02:47.467
I will use some words of some various
new figma features, variables.

46
00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:52.445
All right there are components and
stuff along those lines,

47
00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:57.128
things that kind of make sense
to us as developers because

48
00:02:57.128 --> 00:03:01.144
they map to very engineering
related concepts.

49
00:03:01.144 --> 00:03:03.391
And sometimes you're gonna
work on a side project.

50
00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.263
And when you work on that side project,

51
00:03:05.263 --> 00:03:08.174
you might be helpful to at least
know how to use design tools.

52
00:03:08.174 --> 00:03:11.965
So you don't end up like me where I
started to start designing with Git and

53
00:03:11.965 --> 00:03:14.842
Nit and create React app or
Svelte kit or what have you.

54
00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:19.402
And find myself tweaking CSS just
general I think the basic flow.

55
00:03:19.402 --> 00:03:24.259
A lot of the reason why these tools exist
is because it is easier to kind of think

56
00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:28.011
about the UI in a design tool and
do some of the prototyping.

57
00:03:28.011 --> 00:03:31.552
Towards the end we'll take a very brief
look at some of the prototyping tools

58
00:03:31.552 --> 00:03:32.062
in Figma.

59
00:03:32.062 --> 00:03:36.275
Because one of the biggest things
that will save you time is if we

60
00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:41.125
can take working prototypes to customers
and be able to figure out like,

61
00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:43.048
do you even want this thing?

62
00:03:43.048 --> 00:03:45.315
Before we go ahead and build it, right?

63
00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:47.999
And so all of these things both, I think,

64
00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:53.091
make it easier to learn how to use figma
from a developer perspective, right?

65
00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:54.983
Because yeah,
we're all developers in this room,

66
00:03:54.983 --> 00:03:57.482
I can make jokes about prototypal
inheritance and you'll get them.

67
00:03:57.482 --> 00:04:02.426
And they kind of make a lot of these
concepts a lot easier cuz in my experience

68
00:04:02.426 --> 00:04:06.744
there's not a lot of content out
there about using Figma targeted

69
00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:11.238
at people who also might be on
the implementing side of this as well.

70
00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:15.959
One quick caveat to point out is the large
majority of everything we're gonna

71
00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.692
do until close to the very end of this
workshop is all in the free Tierra Figma.

72
00:04:20.692 --> 00:04:23.714
There are some things
towards the very end,

73
00:04:23.714 --> 00:04:28.452
particularly like variable modes for
doing stuff like dark mode, or

74
00:04:28.452 --> 00:04:32.552
various responsive text that
does involve a paid account.

75
00:04:32.552 --> 00:04:36.623
Stuff like publishing a shared library
does involve a paid account, there is no

76
00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:40.407
expectation that you have a paid Figma
account today, take this course.

77
00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:45.357
I will take you and show you some of these
things in my paid Figma account because

78
00:04:45.357 --> 00:04:48.438
I have it both personally and
through Temporal.

79
00:04:48.438 --> 00:04:52.433
But we'll go ahead and see some of those
features cuz you might also work in

80
00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:55.346
a place eventually that has it or
have it at your work.

81
00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:59.156
And I wanna at least kinda expose you
to some of those things because, again,

82
00:04:59.156 --> 00:05:01.813
for that design team
engineering like integration.

83
00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:06.226
I think a lot of that is where
a lot of the real benefit is here.

84
00:05:06.226 --> 00:05:11.921
So if you are a developer, obviously,
like this course is targeted at you.

85
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.740
But honestly, if you're also a designer,

86
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.035
like understanding the same way the value
prop for developers is understanding

87
00:05:17.035 --> 00:05:19.409
the design tools figure out
how that integration works.

88
00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.920
The inverse is all also true So

89
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.148
the only thing I will say is that,
you know, I am an engineer.

90
00:05:27.148 --> 00:05:31.704
I'm not a designer, I work with designers
Sometimes I pretend to be a designer.

91
00:05:31.704 --> 00:05:35.227
So this is definitely from the how
do we kind of structure and

92
00:05:35.227 --> 00:05:39.672
use all these tools and, you know,
how does that inform implementation?

93
00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:43.346
I will get a little hand wavy when
it comes to stuff like color theory.

94
00:05:43.346 --> 00:05:47.100
And you have a typography here
because that is not my skill set.

95
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:50.848
But there's a whole section on front end
masters that you can definitely watch

96
00:05:50.848 --> 00:05:53.650
courses on that and
see how all that all those pieces work.

97
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.343
So this is kind of like a design tool from

98
00:05:58.343 --> 00:06:03.333
the perspective of a front end engineer.
