WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.058
And so this is one of the places where
this all ties together in a really

2
00:00:03.058 --> 00:00:03.915
interesting way.

3
00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:10.320
I've got this idea of three
different fonts that I might use.

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.493
Right now,
they are all just text objects, right?

5
00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:21.600
What I can do is let's
gotta move this file,

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.164
move to project,
I'm gonna move this into a paid account.

7
00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:29.922
So this is a follow along and
watch lets you have a paid account and

8
00:00:29.922 --> 00:00:30.801
you can do this too.

9
00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.078
But I'm gonna need some modes for this.

10
00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:38.577
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make a component set that's

11
00:00:38.577 --> 00:00:43.992
gonna create three variants
of the same component, right?

12
00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:48.845
Cool, so I've got that,
we'll call it like hero text, right?

13
00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:53.330
Cuz it's not really the content that
matters, cuz in a component I can always

14
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.477
change the content, it's this typeface
font size that we care about.

15
00:00:57.477 --> 00:01:02.555
Now, one thing you'll notice
is that If I go back a second

16
00:01:04.883 --> 00:01:09.619
I named this one size equal mobile size
equals tablet size equals desktop.

17
00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.911
Turns out that when you do that, and
you create a component set the variance,

18
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:16.091
there'll be a property called size and

19
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:18.681
values of mobile desktop and
tablet, right?

20
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.957
And so could you changed the properties
that you saw me do earlier the button?

21
00:01:21.957 --> 00:01:26.510
Absolutely, could you also just name
these things and get it for free?

22
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.224
You can do that too.

23
00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:33.118
So we'll call this hero text.

24
00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:38.205
And we've got that and so now, if I go
to my assets, somewhere, what's this

25
00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:43.321
file called, the problem is this is
meant for a tutorial, not necessarily.

26
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:45.513
Variables, modes, I've got this hero text.

27
00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:49.349
And that's cool,
I can drag one of these in, and

28
00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.100
I can go ahead,
I can switch it between the two.

29
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.763
And that's not bad, that's fun.

30
00:01:55.763 --> 00:02:00.836
That's still helpful for a designer
putting together all these modes.

31
00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:04.412
Like I said, this is one of those
things where it helps designers and

32
00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:06.692
by helps designers, it helps us, right?

33
00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:10.855
Because it means that there's now
consistent typography across the different

34
00:02:10.855 --> 00:02:14.841
sizes, I decided it's bigger in this
one cuz it's never consistent then.

35
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.453
So, we'll go in here and
I'm gonna create a new collection,

36
00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:21.578
cuz your modes are bound
to a particular collection,

37
00:02:21.578 --> 00:02:25.206
so light and dark mode,
you might take our color collection.

38
00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:28.441
This point, we're actually gonna
use something around sizes.

39
00:02:28.441 --> 00:02:34.139
So I'm gonna make a new,
create a collection, and we'll call it,

40
00:02:38.103 --> 00:02:43.692
Break points, and
let's create two variables.

41
00:02:43.692 --> 00:02:51.384
We're gonna make one that's a number and

42
00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:56.230
we're call it min width.

43
00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.384
And we're gonna say that create
three modes in this case.

44
00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:10.931
And we're gonna say that mode number
one is mobile, which is anything.

45
00:03:10.931 --> 00:03:15.878
Mode number two,
I'm trying to remember the break point was

46
00:03:15.878 --> 00:03:19.671
I think it's either 640 or 768 768.

47
00:03:19.671 --> 00:03:26.839
And tablet, thinking two things
at once and desktop, right?

48
00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:34.094
And so this will be 768, and this will be,
I don't know, we're gonna say 1024 for

49
00:03:34.094 --> 00:03:39.357
desktop, I feel like I can look at
my own code but like let's not.

50
00:03:39.357 --> 00:03:43.390
And here's where it gets interesting,
we're gonna create another variable and

51
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.384
this one's gonna be a string variable.

52
00:03:45.384 --> 00:03:47.719
All right, and we're gonna say,

53
00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:57.503
Viewport and this one is going to be there
kind of have the same names as a mode

54
00:03:57.503 --> 00:04:01.015
because because more importantly
than the name of the mode.

55
00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:03.845
It's actually about the name
of the variance that we had.

56
00:04:03.845 --> 00:04:08.475
So we made that text in three variants,
mobile, tablet, and desktop.

57
00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:09.997
So we'll call this one mobile.

58
00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:19.048
Tablet, desktop, awesome.

59
00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:25.531
And so, now we're gonna do is gonna
make a container, here it is.

60
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:28.936
And we're going to say that it's an auto

61
00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:33.053
layout cuz that lets us use admin width,
right?

62
00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:37.220
And at this point what we'll
do is hit Apply variable,

63
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.668
that one's hidden in a dropdown,
I don't make the rules around here.

64
00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:47.488
We'll say it's been with, at that point it
will become zero, you could make it 350 if

65
00:04:47.488 --> 00:04:51.235
you don't want it to get that much
smaller, we could do that as well.

66
00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:56.334
And then, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna drag this component in.

67
00:04:56.334 --> 00:05:00.543
We don't want that to hug, this is
my problem with this zero man with.

68
00:05:06.167 --> 00:05:09.540
And so
we can see that we can go in here and

69
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.956
we say this layer now is
going to be mobile, right?

70
00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:21.562
And for this variant, except to desktop,
we're actually going to say,

71
00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:26.362
hey be viewport,
which is the string mobile.

72
00:05:26.362 --> 00:05:32.475
So now in terms of size instead of
picking mobile, tablet or desktop, right?

73
00:05:32.475 --> 00:05:37.431
We are going to use a variable that
changes based on what mode it's in,

74
00:05:37.431 --> 00:05:40.460
it's either mobile, tablet or desktop.

75
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.436
So if I make this, Teensy tiny, right?

76
00:05:46.436 --> 00:05:53.521
We changed this frame to tablet,
the font gets bigger.

77
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:57.346
We change it to desktop,
the font gets bigger.

78
00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:01.196
So now you can also have fully
responsive text sizes, right?

79
00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:04.968
And the designers can then have like, you
can even like the example I have up here

80
00:06:04.968 --> 00:06:07.747
if we were following along,
I actually set a min and a max.

81
00:06:07.747 --> 00:06:11.451
So like the max gets to right up to where
have mobile guests arrive to where tablet

82
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:13.954
is, the max of tablet gets the write up or
desktop is.

83
00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:17.687
And desktop goes to like whatever
the largest viewport we support is, right?

84
00:06:17.687 --> 00:06:21.406
And now you can instead of having to,
like tweak the fonts cuz like,

85
00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:25.451
prior to kind of coming across US,
the design team they would sit there and

86
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.562
manually change all the typography.

87
00:06:27.562 --> 00:06:32.081
Across five different viewports which
even then the best of intentions

88
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:35.256
leads you me [LAUGH] right,
with a mess to clean up.

89
00:06:35.256 --> 00:06:40.609
Because nobody does it perfectly that much
text, of course that many viewports right?

90
00:06:40.609 --> 00:06:45.278
But you can now like and because
texting kimonos is changeable, right?

91
00:06:45.278 --> 00:06:48.579
Now, they'll switch between
these different typography keys.

92
00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:51.741
And they can now take those responsive
auto layout components that

93
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:54.230
we made earlier,
use those across all the designs.

94
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.072
But that is still one consistent
component for us to implement,

95
00:06:57.072 --> 00:07:00.291
which means that consistent,
the typography can now stay consistent.

96
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:04.596
We can have light and dark mode and
the ability to like export a lot of these

97
00:07:04.596 --> 00:07:08.265
variables gives us like this
amazing ability to kind of like,

98
00:07:08.265 --> 00:07:10.544
then have a very consistent designs.

99
00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:15.126
That we can then export out into the
tokens that we use in our design system,

100
00:07:15.126 --> 00:07:17.473
making our jobs a lot easier, right?

101
00:07:17.473 --> 00:07:19.260
Which is the kind of the value prop here,

102
00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.478
which is how do we help designers help us,
right?

103
00:07:21.478 --> 00:07:25.677
And part of that is knowing how to use
the tools that they're using that we're on

104
00:07:25.677 --> 00:07:28.685
the receiving end of, and
like some of these patterns and

105
00:07:28.685 --> 00:07:31.583
strategies begins to kind
of make their lives easier.

106
00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:35.697
But more importantly,
makes my life easier, which I really like,

107
00:07:35.697 --> 00:07:37.297
I like my life being easy.
