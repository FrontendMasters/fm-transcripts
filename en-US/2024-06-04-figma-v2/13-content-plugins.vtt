00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.988
So, you'll notice that I have avatars and
that I guess as a joke for an Instagram

2
00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:09.618
clone, did I decide it was gonna be
people taking pictures of their food?

3
00:00:09.618 --> 00:00:14.677
Yes, but a lot of times when
you are building out a mock for

4
00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:20.593
a given design, there is the important
stuff which is the layout.

5
00:00:20.593 --> 00:00:23.629
And then there's the unimportant
stuff which is the fake content.

6
00:00:23.629 --> 00:00:27.408
And because we're human,
most of the time we will hyper fixate

7
00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:31.273
on the unimportant stuff at
the neglect of the important stuff.

8
00:00:31.273 --> 00:00:34.868
So I'm gonna show you a cool
little trick and plugin for

9
00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:38.870
making your life slightly easier,
so we can grab anything.

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.090
In this case, we're gonna make get like 3,
4, let's make 5 frames.

11
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.175
And let's say these are eventually
gonna be avatars, right?

12
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:55.815
And so that's a tailwind trick you just
make the border radius ridiculous and

13
00:00:55.815 --> 00:01:01.331
circle, cool, that's how tell
when does the rounded things,

14
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:03.594
it's just that literal.

15
00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:07.599
&gt;&gt; Can you do percentages in there,
do 50%?

16
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.852
&gt;&gt; I think you can, but
I think it turns it into numbers, right?

17
00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:16.692
The math works, I mean in this case,
but it will turn it,

18
00:01:16.692 --> 00:01:19.656
you saw when I did 100%, I don't know.

19
00:01:19.656 --> 00:01:24.239
I was 100% the current value is trying to
do math to I don't know what happens if I

20
00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:28.707
start normally I think about zero 100%
would be 100% zero which is zero.

21
00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:33.537
But like for something that's small,
like five doesn't work too,

22
00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:38.546
but we'll go with the value that I
know works in almost all situations.

23
00:01:38.546 --> 00:01:41.867
And then we can go up to
these Plug-ins up here and

24
00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:46.160
there's one by our friends at
Microsoft called Content Reel.

25
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.358
And this is super useful because you can
either generate if you look there's fake

26
00:01:50.358 --> 00:01:54.062
text, right, that's auto like just
libraries of like fake stuff that

27
00:01:54.062 --> 00:01:57.417
you can fill in there so
if you're doing addresses or whatever.

28
00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:01.366
But there's also images where you can
get like avatars, there's one for

29
00:02:01.366 --> 00:02:05.067
food as you can imagine,
that's where the food pictures came from.

30
00:02:05.067 --> 00:02:08.853
I find it slightly offensive
that as far as I could tell,

31
00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:13.381
all the maps are of the San Francisco
Bay Area, I don't like that.

32
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:17.042
And so we can click Avatars here, and

33
00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:21.886
I have five frames selected
I can hit apply all and

34
00:02:21.886 --> 00:02:27.455
it will randomly fill in five
of those avatars, right?

35
00:02:27.455 --> 00:02:31.828
So if you do need just some like
generated fake content for a design,

36
00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:33.604
it's free, it's great.

37
00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:36.387
You don't need to sign in, you only need
to sign if you wanna add your own stuff.

38
00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:40.654
But then you can add your own library if
there is like unique stuff to whatever

39
00:02:40.654 --> 00:02:41.997
design you working on.

40
00:02:41.997 --> 00:02:46.402
But that is where all of
this fake stuff comes from.
