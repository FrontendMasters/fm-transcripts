WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.654
The next kind of newer feature in
Figma then takes this with one or

2
00:00:03.654 --> 00:00:05.220
two additional features.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.922
We're gonna take the idea of auto layouts,
we're gonna take the idea of min and

4
00:00:08.922 --> 00:00:12.237
max width, and then we're gonna take
kind of a new layout feature which

5
00:00:12.237 --> 00:00:14.524
is this like equivalent deflects wrap,
right?

6
00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:19.777
That's gonna give us some additional
abilities to create responsive components.

7
00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:24.085
But we use in our design, so
let's take a look and jump into that.

8
00:00:24.085 --> 00:00:28.823
So I'm gonna do this Tarantino
style where I'm going to show you

9
00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:32.783
the ending first,
we're gonna see how we got there.

10
00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:37.547
What we want to build is a component kind
of like this, you're like, yeah, cool,

11
00:00:37.547 --> 00:00:40.697
it's a card,
I've seen a card before leave me alone.

12
00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:46.442
But wait, there's more, I expand it, okay.

13
00:00:46.442 --> 00:00:50.839
You're like, whatever, man,
haven't you shown me like six of these?

14
00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.961
Look at that at a certain viewpoint
with it changes the layout, right?

15
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.817
And you can see that we've got this
it's bottom section here that kind of

16
00:01:02.817 --> 00:01:07.211
stays consistent, we've got kind
of text that kind of reflows.

17
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:11.600
And then at a certain point, our
responsive design breakpoint hits, right?

18
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.389
And we can have it in different shapes,
and

19
00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:16.037
I think it's got a max width of
1920 cuz I got carried away.

20
00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:20.652
But maybe it should be less than that, but
it's got a min width, it's got a max width

21
00:01:20.652 --> 00:01:24.894
but it does kind of reshape and respond
as you can put in different viewports.

22
00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:29.787
And this is again super great
because like the ability to

23
00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:34.992
use one component multiple places
in a design means that you

24
00:01:34.992 --> 00:01:40.213
will have consistency when you
go to implement it, right?

25
00:01:40.213 --> 00:01:42.773
It's one of those things that
like anyone working in a design,

26
00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:45.433
having one component they can use
across different view ports and

27
00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:47.480
have it be responsive,
makes their life easier.

28
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.097
And then for you as the developer,
makes your life easier too.

29
00:01:51.097 --> 00:01:53.288
So I can keep,
I joked with windows before,

30
00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:57.140
when you're checking in responsive design,
you just do this over and over,

31
00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.005
over again, I can keep doing this or
we can look at how to.

32
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.721
Should we look at it in a minute,
we should look at it in a minute.

33
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:07.450
Okay, so I've got all of the component
pieces and parts, and I'll give

34
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.561
you a spoiler alert now, you're gonna
do it when I'm done, so pay attention.

35
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:14.342
[LAUGH] Or
you can just ignore me, whatever.

36
00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:18.762
So we've got all of the pieces and
we wanna figure out,

37
00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:24.148
how do we actually implement that
design that I just made bigger and

38
00:02:24.148 --> 00:02:27.530
smaller repeatedly while I was talking.

39
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.564
Cool so let's go ahead and
let's try it out.

40
00:02:31.564 --> 00:02:35.694
So this is a section so I can't turn it
into an auto layout if I wanted to, so

41
00:02:35.694 --> 00:02:40.049
let's go ahead and kind of like give
ourselves a little workspace over here.

42
00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:44.378
So we've got,
let's actually draw ourselves a new frame.

43
00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:47.401
Doesn't really matter.

44
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:51.505
We'll go ahead and
we'll drag the image in,

45
00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:56.367
we'll start out by making
that an auto layout frame.

46
00:02:56.367 --> 00:03:01.448
Now, at first I don't need
that much padding Let's

47
00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:05.846
give it like, I don't know 16 feels good.

48
00:03:05.846 --> 00:03:11.988
So at this point, it's hugging the
contents, instead of that we're actually

49
00:03:11.988 --> 00:03:17.315
going to say, fill the container,
which makes us now a fixed width.

50
00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:23.374
Cool, so now you can see we'll at
least expand to a certain point.

51
00:03:23.374 --> 00:03:27.414
And then this actually has a min and
a max width,

52
00:03:27.414 --> 00:03:34.282
because as I was undoing design, like they
vanish when they leave an auto frame,

53
00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:38.428
auto layout frame, so
I forgot to take that off.

54
00:03:38.428 --> 00:03:40.656
[LAUGH] Right, and
now they're back that they're in here.

55
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:48.137
So spoiler alert, we can set a min width
to 268, a max width to 640, right?

56
00:03:48.137 --> 00:03:52.447
For the frame itself, again, I just,

57
00:03:52.447 --> 00:03:58.859
through implementing design
after design after design.

58
00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.612
I always think about 375,
which is like iPhone SE,

59
00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:07.851
which is usually the smallest viewport
that I tend to have to implement for.

60
00:04:07.851 --> 00:04:11.806
Let's give this auto
frame a min width of 375,

61
00:04:11.806 --> 00:04:16.702
which means we'll never hit
the lower bound of this image, so

62
00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:21.337
you can could raise it,
it also doesn't matter, right?

63
00:04:21.337 --> 00:04:23.821
Cuz the parent can't get
any smaller than 375,

64
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:27.995
which means the image will never hit that
268 min, but it doesn't really matter.

65
00:04:27.995 --> 00:04:29.280
But it can get bigger, and

66
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.023
you could choose that I should have a max
width at some point, like in the exam

67
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.669
one I had 1920 because that's usually
the largest design that I get.

68
00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.012
But like one would argue for

69
00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:41.527
a card like this Because you should
have columns at some point, right?

70
00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:43.913
But that's an implementation detail.

71
00:04:43.913 --> 00:04:49.273
Cool, so we've got that in place,

72
00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:57.324
so now let's drag in some
of the other parts, right?

73
00:04:57.324 --> 00:04:57.879
That's going great, right?

74
00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.147
So we can drag in this scan even better.

75
00:05:02.147 --> 00:05:07.489
So clearly, we can turn off clip contents
for a moment here so I can see everything.

76
00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:11.234
Okay, so one thing we can pretty much
figure out is that you've got some amount

77
00:05:11.234 --> 00:05:12.275
of a flex direction.

78
00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:16.938
Now we are gonna change this to a wrap
in a second, but we do know that these

79
00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:21.762
are almost in every iteration of this
stacked on top of each other, right?

80
00:05:21.762 --> 00:05:27.018
And so these two become
a frame that then get an auto

81
00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:31.911
layout where we'll have
it become vertical.

82
00:05:31.911 --> 00:05:36.399
Now clearly that does not solve
all of my problems for me, but

83
00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.956
it gets me Be part of the way there.

84
00:05:38.956 --> 00:05:43.077
So then the trick now is we turn
on this wrap setting, right?

85
00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:47.546
And, look, we're starting to
get a sense of that card.

86
00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:51.624
Now we do need to change
the height to hug contents, and

87
00:05:51.624 --> 00:05:55.540
we're starting to get
the beginnings of this here.

88
00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:00.315
And so it will wrap now,
the interesting part here

89
00:06:00.315 --> 00:06:04.299
is that the image has a max width, right?

90
00:06:04.299 --> 00:06:07.850
So it is set to fill container,
but at a certain point,

91
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:13.507
it stops obeying that fill container rule
cuz its max width takes precedence, right?

92
00:06:13.507 --> 00:06:19.749
So it'll keep growing, it'll keep growing,
it'll keep growing, and then it'll stop.

93
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:23.127
Right, cuz it'll have hit that max width,

94
00:06:23.127 --> 00:06:27.157
which then kind of gets us
to this mode here, right?

95
00:06:27.157 --> 00:06:32.524
So that's how you create that kind
of like flipping effect here,

96
00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:36.525
the other thing you'll
notice about wrap is that

97
00:06:36.525 --> 00:06:40.442
before we had one gap between,
now we have two.

98
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:44.894
We have one for the kind of,
the gap between rows and another for

99
00:06:44.894 --> 00:06:50.530
the gap between the columns, we've got
a vertical gap and a, horizontal gap.

100
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.451
So you could theoretically
we could say that that's 16.

101
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:04.224
If I wanted more space in this mode,
I can say this is 32.

102
00:07:06.757 --> 00:07:11.409
Doesn't seem to be much of a difference,
but cool,

103
00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:16.484
this we wanna say,
this is also gonna be fill container,

104
00:07:16.484 --> 00:07:20.103
this probably needs a min width as well.

105
00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:28.908
So I could say 3 75,

106
00:07:28.908 --> 00:07:33.150
I said these are 16, so

107
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:37.392
I could say 375- 32

108
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.497
These will also fill up their container.

109
00:07:46.348 --> 00:07:50.453
Because it's, again,
it's a nested auto layout, cool.

110
00:07:56.638 --> 00:07:59.082
And we'll actually have this one,
hug the height and

111
00:07:59.082 --> 00:08:01.497
we'll have this one hug that's hugging.

112
00:08:01.497 --> 00:08:03.852
I need that smaller one.

113
00:08:10.426 --> 00:08:12.314
All right, so we start to get that effect,

114
00:08:12.314 --> 00:08:15.265
cuz at one point they each have
their minimums that they need to be.

115
00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:20.541
So at one point they can't both
fit in there, so it flips over and

116
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:24.549
wraps And
then we've got that bottom bar there,

117
00:08:24.549 --> 00:08:30.049
which as you can imagine is just
another auto layout, there we go.

118
00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:34.492
Cool, so let's see what we do here,
what I'll probably

119
00:08:34.492 --> 00:08:39.043
choose to do here is kind of
start to lay them out like this.

120
00:08:39.043 --> 00:08:43.527
Because I know that these are like kind
of one component this would be a div of

121
00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:44.675
some sort in HTML.

122
00:08:44.675 --> 00:08:47.816
Like when in doubt, you're like,
I don't know where to make the frames and

123
00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:48.317
what to do.

124
00:08:48.317 --> 00:08:51.824
Just look at it like you would look
at a React component or HTML or

125
00:08:51.824 --> 00:08:52.957
whatever, right?

126
00:08:52.957 --> 00:08:58.252
That same intuitive sense that you have
for implementing it and code, gives

127
00:08:58.252 --> 00:09:04.053
you a competitive advantage when it comes
to implementing these designs, right?

128
00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:07.950
So we'll give that an auto layer of frame,
and then we've got that date.

129
00:09:17.498 --> 00:09:22.626
We can kind of give that
Wrap it in a frame,

130
00:09:22.626 --> 00:09:26.447
make it an auto layout as well.

131
00:09:26.447 --> 00:09:31.529
Okay, so in this point what we
wanna do is let's just tweak

132
00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:36.838
this a little bit,
horizontally center it, let it be auto.

133
00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:44.168
Cool.

134
00:09:48.202 --> 00:09:53.053
So we've got all of that in place now,
and then I'll probably

135
00:09:53.053 --> 00:09:58.202
wrap this all one more time in a frame and
make that an auto layout.

136
00:10:00.888 --> 00:10:01.860
Right?
So we've got that.

137
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.380
We don't necessarily need all that space.

138
00:10:06.732 --> 00:10:07.682
A little bit more of that.

139
00:10:07.682 --> 00:10:09.025
Yeah, sure make it eight.

140
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.916
Cool.

141
00:10:11.916 --> 00:10:13.743
We'll give this whole
thing a fill of white.

142
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.295
We'll give this earlier whether we made

143
00:10:31.882 --> 00:10:38.003
And finally,
surrounded corners because why not?

144
00:10:38.003 --> 00:10:39.474
I meant to do that for the whole thing.

145
00:10:47.222 --> 00:10:49.379
Cool as I get a little bit.

146
00:10:55.989 --> 00:11:03.859
That's when I should doesn't need the
padding anymore and looks like we've got

147
00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:13.342
Then something similar
to what we had before.

148
00:11:13.342 --> 00:11:18.291
And again now this is totally responsive
I can put it you know in a more if I put

149
00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:21.526
this give it a min min width
to on this frame here.

150
00:11:21.526 --> 00:11:24.189
So now I can put this in a mobile layout,
it'll look right,

151
00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:26.654
I can drag the same component
into the desktop layout.

152
00:11:26.654 --> 00:11:31.281
It will look, there's some little
teensy tweaks that I need to do,

153
00:11:31.281 --> 00:11:33.402
like that and stuff like that.

154
00:11:33.402 --> 00:11:38.081
And you can dial it in exactly the way
you want it, but generally speaking,

155
00:11:38.081 --> 00:11:39.951
like we've got the general.

156
00:11:43.877 --> 00:11:46.859
Yeah, probably a little bit
of men gaps here to tweak but

157
00:11:46.859 --> 00:11:50.857
we've got the idea of the wrapped
component that we can use across all these

158
00:11:50.857 --> 00:11:52.524
different implementations.

159
00:11:52.524 --> 00:11:54.488
And this means that things
will be consistent,

160
00:11:54.488 --> 00:11:57.690
it also makes the job of the designer once
they have this in place a lot easier.

161
00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:01.771
Cuz now I can tell sometimes
I get designs where it's

162
00:12:01.771 --> 00:12:06.241
like you bespoke made five
different views are, right?

163
00:12:06.241 --> 00:12:08.037
As an engineer that hurts me, right?

164
00:12:08.037 --> 00:12:10.377
Cuz if I bespoke wrote the same
code over and over and

165
00:12:10.377 --> 00:12:13.602
over again instead of writing a function,
it's the same basic idea.

166
00:12:13.602 --> 00:12:16.804
We don't code up five different viewports,

167
00:12:16.804 --> 00:12:22.377
we tend to implement breakpoints in CSS,
and the same idea works here as well.
