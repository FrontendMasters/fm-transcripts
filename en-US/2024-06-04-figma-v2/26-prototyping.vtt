WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.730
So real quick, we're not gonna talk too
much about prototyping, but I will show it

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.793
to you, because I think prototyping
is a really powerful tool in Figma,

3
00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:11.213
but also, I know how to write JavaScript.

4
00:00:11.213 --> 00:00:16.456
So a lot of times, if I wanna prototype
something, I could just build it,

5
00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:20.362
but it's kind of an interesting
concept here as well.

6
00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:25.235
And so with prototyping, we can kind
of create mockups of the UI and

7
00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:27.594
put them in front of customers.

8
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:33.166
And ideally, this one only saves
me work because work I don't

9
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:38.105
have to do is a lot faster
than work I have to do, right?

10
00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.698
So in this case, we can go ahead, and

11
00:00:40.698 --> 00:00:45.321
I'll just kind of show you real
quick with like one or two things.

12
00:00:45.321 --> 00:00:52.639
We can create one of these viewports,
let's go ahead and take the frame tool.

13
00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:57.416
Let's say iPhone 14,

14
00:00:57.416 --> 00:01:00.376
great, cool.

15
00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:01.831
We can go ahead, and

16
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:06.721
we can begin to put together something
that looks like a UI, right?

17
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:08.289
So I've got some pieces in here.

18
00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.353
And this is where our constraints come
back to help us, like some layout guys

19
00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:16.177
would probably also be super helpful for
getting everything in place.

20
00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:20.615
So we've got that, we can give this one
like we saw before, constraints that's

21
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:24.354
left and right and top because I
pull these out of a working version.

22
00:01:24.354 --> 00:01:27.301
They forgot them when they left the frame,
but

23
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:29.878
then remember them when they go back in.

24
00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:37.164
So these are now very similar to what we
had before, great, awesome, seems good.

25
00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:41.564
We can go grab some of these as well,

26
00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:48.460
put one more frame in here,
I'm gonna take this frame,

27
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.025
and I'm gonna say get big like that.

28
00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:59.965
Take up this area,
I'm gonna make this one an auto layout.

29
00:01:59.965 --> 00:02:05.065
And what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna say this

30
00:02:05.065 --> 00:02:10.445
width is fixed, but
hug the contents, right?

31
00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:15.184
Which means be the width of the viewport,
but how tall you are,

32
00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:18.593
let's see what's in you first, all right?

33
00:02:18.593 --> 00:02:21.317
We'll keep the default padding, I could
use my cozy padding if I wanted to.

34
00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:23.088
Yeah, let's do that to
bring it all together.

35
00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:29.226
Cozy padding,
let's say 8 between them two.

36
00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:34.796
Awesome, and so what we'll do is
we'll grab some of these posts,

37
00:02:34.796 --> 00:02:38.348
we'll drag them in, Right?

38
00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.848
Is that inside my frame?

39
00:02:45.848 --> 00:02:49.396
Cool, so that kind of snapped in there,
we'll say, yeah,

40
00:02:49.396 --> 00:02:52.264
fill and be your fixed width,
that's perfect.

41
00:02:52.264 --> 00:03:00.309
We'll take these other ones as well,
Go inside the frame.

42
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:04.336
You can see that it's bigger
than the viewport at this point,

43
00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:05.891
which is totally fine.

44
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:11.493
We're just gonna put that,
Behind the different navigations,

45
00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:14.072
let's grab one more for good effect.

46
00:03:19.054 --> 00:03:21.692
My aim isn't so great.

47
00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:24.356
Cool, so we've got that in place.

48
00:03:24.356 --> 00:03:29.192
And now, what we can do is we just
need to do a few more tweaks for

49
00:03:29.192 --> 00:03:32.448
the prototyping piece here, all right?

50
00:03:32.448 --> 00:03:36.398
What we're gonna do is switch
over the prototype tab, and

51
00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:41.404
we're gonna say for the top nav,
we're gonna say fixed, stay in place.

52
00:03:41.404 --> 00:03:47.102
For the bottom nav,
we're gonna say fixed, stay in place.

53
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:49.788
And for this one,
the middle we're going to say,

54
00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:03.557
Hold on, I grabbed, yeah, I want my frame,
Let's see how that works real quick.

55
00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:07.202
Overflow vertical.

56
00:04:07.202 --> 00:04:12.325
So now I can go in here, You

57
00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:16.432
can deal with that with in a second,
I think maybe I picked a viewpoint that

58
00:04:16.432 --> 00:04:19.423
wasn't exactly the same as
the device that I picked.

59
00:04:19.423 --> 00:04:24.848
But you can see that,
failing to adjust for that a second,

60
00:04:24.848 --> 00:04:29.297
I do get something that feels like a UI,
right?

61
00:04:29.297 --> 00:04:33.020
Let's go ahead,
I could share the prototype as well.

62
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.175
14 and 15 max and
was my prototypes that too,

63
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.207
I said yeah, I don't wanna max,
I want plus, plus seems good.

64
00:04:49.207 --> 00:04:52.794
So we have the product is working, we
just had an issue where as I was dragging

65
00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:55.329
stuff around,
I changed the size of things, right?

66
00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:57.681
And so you can get a feel, and

67
00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:02.885
if I had hover states over buttons,
you would see that as well.

68
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:06.762
I mean, maybe not on an iPhone because
hover and touch, you know what I mean.

69
00:05:06.762 --> 00:05:10.254
Like try doing that in the Chrome DevTools
too, but like theoretically.

70
00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:13.796
The other really interesting
thing that you can do is,

71
00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.568
let's say we made a clone of this, right?

72
00:05:16.568 --> 00:05:22.254
And we took out the contents
of that intermediate frame,

73
00:05:22.254 --> 00:05:26.880
and we just said instead
we're gonna drag in,

74
00:05:29.183 --> 00:05:31.857
Like a few of these,

75
00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:45.250
Go ahead, duplicate that a bunch of times
and keep that going too if I wanted to.

76
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.060
And then,

77
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.746
I could theoretically grab this in
a victory lap to pull this all together.

78
00:05:56.362 --> 00:06:01.917
We can grab a bunch of the different
avatars, can I select them all?

79
00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:02.694
We'll find out.

80
00:06:02.694 --> 00:06:07.740
But I can use that content real,
grab a bunch of these

81
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.912
just manually,
I can content reel them all in place.

82
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.145
And I can even replace names and
stuff like that, but

83
00:06:22.145 --> 00:06:24.296
let's just go with the avatars.

84
00:06:24.296 --> 00:06:27.511
Let's go with photos, that's a new one,
I haven't tried that one yet.

85
00:06:27.511 --> 00:06:31.594
Those don't look AI generated at all,
sarcasm.

86
00:06:31.594 --> 00:06:33.632
The session card that I used earlier,

87
00:06:33.632 --> 00:06:36.380
that was an AI generated
picture from Midjourney.

88
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.966
It was like person thought leader giving
conference talk, and A JavaScript or

89
00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:43.757
something like that,
and that's what we got.

90
00:06:43.757 --> 00:06:48.602
Cool, cool, and
what's really cool about this,

91
00:06:48.602 --> 00:06:52.777
and we'll even just do
one more real quick.

92
00:06:52.777 --> 00:06:56.854
We'll go ahead and
close all those and delete them, and

93
00:06:56.854 --> 00:07:01.472
in this case, what we're gonna
do is we'll grab one of these.

94
00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.123
And one

95
00:07:07.123 --> 00:07:13.625
of these,

96
00:07:28.376 --> 00:07:31.195
Let's see,
I will just leave my desk for a second,

97
00:07:31.195 --> 00:07:33.763
cuz that's not the point
I'm trying to make.

98
00:07:33.763 --> 00:07:38.387
We'll go ahead and
duplicate that a bunch of times.

99
00:07:38.387 --> 00:07:42.827
And what's really kind of cool about this,

100
00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:46.309
take one of these and just, cool.

101
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.817
Is that,

102
00:07:46.817 --> 00:07:50.948
then you can actually set up flows in
between the different screens, right?

103
00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:57.449
So I could theoretically
grab this message icon here,

104
00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:01.841
and we'll go to prototype, right?

105
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:08.250
And you can see this little plus sign,
we're gonna drag it here.

106
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.800
And then, we'll just say with this one,

107
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.871
grab this plus sign,
and we'll drag it here.

108
00:08:17.871 --> 00:08:22.676
And now, if we go to our prototype,
you can see it starts over here.

109
00:08:22.676 --> 00:08:29.069
You can start to build out the entire
experience, we're in the wrong place.

110
00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:31.810
That's what happens when
you talk in prototype.

111
00:08:31.810 --> 00:08:33.065
We'll go right here.

112
00:08:37.335 --> 00:08:39.443
And I can tap the message thing, and

113
00:08:39.443 --> 00:08:42.330
then I can see the screen
tab on the first person.

114
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:47.090
And you can even, go ahead,
you click here and

115
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.618
there is Instant, we're gonna do Move in,

116
00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.272
And on this one,
we'll also say move in, and

117
00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:08.291
we'll go back to this frame here,
and we'll do the prototype.

118
00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:11.488
And so here, if we click this messages,

119
00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:16.014
we kind of get what feels
a little bit like an app, right?

120
00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.976
There's ability to do a back button and
stuff along those lines as well.

121
00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:21.273
And so, you can kind of like
figure out the flow and

122
00:09:21.273 --> 00:09:24.229
get all those things in place,
which is also somewhat helpful,

123
00:09:24.229 --> 00:09:26.931
like there are times depending
on what we're working on.

124
00:09:26.931 --> 00:09:29.151
Like as if it's something straightforward
like hey, we're updating this table?

125
00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:30.267
No, right?

126
00:09:30.267 --> 00:09:34.103
But if there are other interactions like
a lot of times along with the design,

127
00:09:34.103 --> 00:09:37.468
I'll get the prototype to kind of
get a sense of the interactions and

128
00:09:37.468 --> 00:09:38.726
feel of a given feature.

129
00:09:38.726 --> 00:09:41.582
Depending on like, we don't do it for
everything, but we do it for

130
00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:42.812
some of the things, right?

131
00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:44.831
And like you can kind of
get all the way there.

132
00:09:44.831 --> 00:09:49.280
But the important part is there a lot
of like, I think as Figma grows,

133
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.991
especially more true than when
we did this two years ago.

134
00:09:52.991 --> 00:09:57.199
Stuff like the variables and
the ability to generate the tokens for

135
00:09:57.199 --> 00:09:58.862
a design system, right?

136
00:09:58.862 --> 00:10:03.572
Stuff like those responsive components
that kind of like change their layout with

137
00:10:03.572 --> 00:10:07.609
that flex wrap and min and max heights,
those are all new too, right.

138
00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:11.674
And there is more of an ability
than there was, not too long ago,

139
00:10:11.674 --> 00:10:14.987
to actually primitives in the design,
that can very

140
00:10:14.987 --> 00:10:19.753
cleanly translate into the primitives
in the development piece, right?

141
00:10:19.753 --> 00:10:24.011
That said, kind of tried to
pause in the beginning here,

142
00:10:24.011 --> 00:10:29.707
it is kinda somewhat on us to kind of
then play a collaborative role, right?

143
00:10:29.707 --> 00:10:34.940
It is one thing to kvetch about the amount
of work it takes to implement a design,

144
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.453
but I do think that there's
a lot that we can do kinda,

145
00:10:38.453 --> 00:10:40.890
knowing on both sides of the flow of.

146
00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:45.470
Here are some abilities that actually
makes the whole developer design

147
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.928
interaction easier.

148
00:10:46.928 --> 00:10:51.691
Also like I said before, you could be in
a startup, or you could just be working on

149
00:10:51.691 --> 00:10:55.265
a site project, it is a lot
easier to prototype something and

150
00:10:55.265 --> 00:10:58.931
then implement it on my own than
to be like, get a nit, right?

151
00:10:58.931 --> 00:11:02.950
Like create react app, let's go, that
always sounds great on a Saturday morning,

152
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.193
and then I don't know what I'm
doing by the afternoon, all right?

153
00:11:06.193 --> 00:11:10.845
And so, get a lot of that in place early I
think is also a developer's regret because

154
00:11:10.845 --> 00:11:14.897
a lot of times like the thing where it
just start styling stuff all the time

155
00:11:14.897 --> 00:11:17.579
without a real plan bites
me almost every time.

156
00:11:17.579 --> 00:11:21.272
So I think being able to use these tools
are incredibly powerful as well cuz like,

157
00:11:21.272 --> 00:11:24.277
you can be able to like stitch
together a prototype is super cool.

158
00:11:24.277 --> 00:11:28.002
But I think a lot of stuff around
the variables and the modes and

159
00:11:28.002 --> 00:11:32.317
creating stuff that very cleanly maps
to what you might see in the code.

160
00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:35.224
And like yeah,
we saw we can change the values.

161
00:11:35.224 --> 00:11:37.144
Like I would love to tell you that like,

162
00:11:37.144 --> 00:11:39.423
developer mode makes
everything super easy.

163
00:11:39.423 --> 00:11:41.652
It's a nice starting point, right?

164
00:11:41.652 --> 00:11:48.863
To have like the, if I go to one of these,
for instance, like to get a sense of like,

165
00:11:48.863 --> 00:11:54.447
if I output it all these variables like,
could I grab this code?

166
00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:55.915
Sure.

167
00:11:55.915 --> 00:11:58.024
Is there a lot of times a lot
of code I don't want to grab?

168
00:11:58.024 --> 00:12:01.350
Almost always, right?

169
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.358
So you're like one cannot just defer to
it, but getting the colors cleanly listed,

170
00:12:05.358 --> 00:12:08.349
getting at least a starting point,
it's an inspiration, but

171
00:12:08.349 --> 00:12:10.221
it doesn't always solve everything.
