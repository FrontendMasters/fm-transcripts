1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.070
So your mission is to take this and this
and make it behave like it should, right?

2
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:12.610
So take about ten minutes, and
then we will review it together.

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.736
And if you want to,
if you're kind of using the project file,

4
00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:17.130
this is currently hidden.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.667
If you need inspiration,
if you need to cheat, you can go ahead and

6
00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.422
unhide this one and take a look at it, but

7
00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:30.198
then we'll implement it together in a few
minutes and learn all about constraints.

8
00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:42.177
All right, so our mission was to make this
actually behave like a responsive webpage,

9
00:00:42.177 --> 00:00:46.606
and then also we had a second
little exercise down there as well.

10
00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:50.508
So let's go ahead and try out all these
cuz I think it's one of those things where

11
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:54.525
the first time you do it, it's not super
intuitive, but then if you do it enough,

12
00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:58.079
you kind of get the muscle memory,
you just click around on a few things,

13
00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.671
set a few things, and you're good to go.

14
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:04.064
So you can follow along and
watch me as I show off

15
00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:09.611
the muscle memory that I have
accidentally earned over the years.

16
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:12.498
Okay, so looking at this we've got,

17
00:01:12.498 --> 00:01:17.161
these will eventually be
little fake Instagram posts.

18
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.721
But let's start with the navbars first,
right?

19
00:01:21.721 --> 00:01:24.831
So go ahead and
write by default left and top.

20
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:28.086
So in this case I want these left and
right.

21
00:01:28.086 --> 00:01:30.995
And we do actually want the top
nav to stick to the top,

22
00:01:30.995 --> 00:01:35.961
regardless of what we do to the frame, and
this will work even if I stretch it up.

23
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:38.091
I was stretching that.

24
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:41.896
Let's grab the actual frame, right?

25
00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:45.204
The top stuff will actually,
now my bottom bar is following it, but

26
00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:48.410
anything to the top will fall even
when we stretch it up to the top.

27
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.579
Cool, so let's do the bottom.

28
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.619
That's the same idea of left and right.

29
00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.849
And we make the constraint at the bottom,
right?

30
00:01:55.849 --> 00:02:01.973
And now if I grab the overall frame,
right, we're getting there.

31
00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:06.933
But things fall apart a little bit
with these posts if I do this.

32
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:09.563
So in this case, I got two options here.

33
00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:11.233
I could choose to scale them.

34
00:02:11.233 --> 00:02:12.903
Let's see what that looks like.

35
00:02:12.903 --> 00:02:15.823
And then if we don't like that we'll
try something else, so it will scale.

36
00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:21.675
It's not gonna work but That could be

37
00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:25.635
what I want depending on the effect
that you're going for, right?

38
00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:29.943
It's stretching them out, but
it's not necessarily making them, keeping

39
00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:34.582
the proportion, which is probably not the
experience that we're used to maybe for

40
00:02:34.582 --> 00:02:38.020
a paragraph or
something along those lines.

41
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.106
But for
an image is probably not what I want.

42
00:02:41.106 --> 00:02:46.630
So we can go ahead and instead of scale,
let's see what the difference is.

43
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.830
Well, I can scale them both, right?

44
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.744
That's also probably gonna be a little,

45
00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:53.970
it all depends on the effect
you're going for, honestly.

46
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.850
But that'll give me this, which again,
maybe, and then the difference here where

47
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.523
we say actually keep them towards the top,
right, cuz they're not necessarily

48
00:03:03.523 --> 00:03:07.392
supposed to stretch even if
the viewport becomes taller, right?

49
00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:09.952
That's not usually how the web works.

50
00:03:09.952 --> 00:03:13.526
And then we'll kinda keep them,
let's do a center in this case, right?

51
00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:20.639
And that's maybe what we might normally
see maybe there'd be some responsive

52
00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.125
breakpoints that would go into two columns
at one point, and if we did left and

53
00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:29.075
right it's gonna be very similar
to the scale on this case, right?

54
00:03:29.075 --> 00:03:32.063
But I think for the effect that we want,
let's go with center.

55
00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:43.944
Cool, that feels like
a very rudimentary web app.

56
00:03:43.944 --> 00:03:47.404
Awesome, and with this one, let's see.

57
00:03:47.404 --> 00:03:49.811
There's a few more pieces involved, but

58
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:52.984
let's see how it breaks when
I grab the overall frame.

59
00:03:52.984 --> 00:03:56.332
Nothing moves, and in a lot of ways,

60
00:03:56.332 --> 00:04:00.767
this is not dissimilar
from what we had earlier.

61
00:04:02.547 --> 00:04:05.891
So we'll grab this top piece again,
this will,

62
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.657
we will actually want
the overall header in this case.

63
00:04:09.657 --> 00:04:11.427
So do that to left and right.

64
00:04:13.337 --> 00:04:16.918
Now we've got two pieces down here.

65
00:04:16.918 --> 00:04:20.070
So we'll go ahead and we'll actually
say that this will stay to the bottom,

66
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.954
and I think we want both
of them at the bottom.

67
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.682
And that'll get us almost there,

68
00:04:27.682 --> 00:04:31.932
you'll see obviously the image
is not set up for this yet.

69
00:04:31.932 --> 00:04:34.837
Okay, interesting, I need to take both,

70
00:04:34.837 --> 00:04:40.101
at least the middle nav with the bookmark
and make that left and right as well.

71
00:04:40.101 --> 00:04:41.728
So let's go ahead and we'll do that.

72
00:04:47.084 --> 00:04:50.653
Okay, now we gotta deal with the image.

73
00:04:50.653 --> 00:04:54.793
So with this one scale is again not
gonna do necessarily what I want, but

74
00:04:54.793 --> 00:04:56.382
let's do it anyway to see.

75
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:07.549
The problem with scale is
it will scale literally and

76
00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:11.527
get all kind of distorted as well.

77
00:05:11.527 --> 00:05:17.522
So in this case,
let's actually do left and

78
00:05:17.522 --> 00:05:21.417
right, and top and bottom.

79
00:05:21.417 --> 00:05:23.530
And now it kind of keeps its
dimensions a little bit better.

80
00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.330
You can see that it will fill the space
rather than getting distorted as well.

81
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.066
And that feels kind of a nice responsive
component that we can kind of put into

82
00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:37.100
design and
have it actually react appropriately.

83
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.141
Now that was inside of a frame then you
can theoretically take the overall,

84
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.310
eventually we'll get to the point where
these are then components all the way

85
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.163
down, right?

86
00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:49.317
We've got constraints on
each individual piece of UI.

87
00:05:49.317 --> 00:05:53.385
We've got their place in the container,
each piece, so

88
00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:57.877
as we go ahead and figure out all
of the different breakpoints,

89
00:05:57.877 --> 00:06:02.964
because the one thing that I have
learned the hard way particularly when

90
00:06:02.964 --> 00:06:07.881
working on implementing Figma designs
as a developer is a lot of times

91
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:12.883
you'll get the designs and
they have 375 as your mobile viewport,

92
00:06:12.883 --> 00:06:16.915
either 640 or 768 for
tablet, so on and so forth.

93
00:06:16.915 --> 00:06:23.185
And you'll get the designs, and
each one of those breakpoints looks great.

94
00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:26.135
You know it doesn't look right
anywhere in the middle of any

95
00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:27.731
of those breakpoints, right?

96
00:06:27.731 --> 00:06:31.764
And so the ability to kind of test that
out in the design versus the kind of back

97
00:06:31.764 --> 00:06:34.348
and forth of, okay,
I did the breakpoints, and

98
00:06:34.348 --> 00:06:38.383
then it's very easy once you've
implemented in code to take your browser,

99
00:06:38.383 --> 00:06:41.796
I understand that Chrome has
those various response modes.

100
00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:44.383
But we all know that the first
thing anyone does when they see

101
00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:47.177
a new web page being implement is
they take the browser window and

102
00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:50.216
do that repeatedly with it and
change the width of the window.

103
00:06:50.216 --> 00:06:52.966
And that is sometimes how
I end up developing to,

104
00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:57.945
what I'm actually writing the code, yeah,
I'll stay in those different viewports.

105
00:06:57.945 --> 00:07:02.634
But a lot of times you'll see all the
various little intermediary phases where

106
00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:06.541
things overlap, the contrast isn't
there so on and so forth, so

107
00:07:06.541 --> 00:07:10.184
getting this set up in your
designs becomes super powerful.
