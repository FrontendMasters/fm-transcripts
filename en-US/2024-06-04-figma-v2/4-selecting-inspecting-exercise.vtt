00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
There are other useful things
that we need to do in terms of

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.616
getting a whole bunch of
different objects, right?

3
00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:12.475
Could I hunt and try to get all of the
yellow or the red or the cyan rectangles?

4
00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:19.731
I could, and honestly, in this amount
of a design, it's not that hard, right?

5
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:24.533
But as your files grow,
it becomes a lot trickier.

6
00:00:24.533 --> 00:00:28.121
Last week I was working
on buttons with icons,

7
00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:32.722
and I needed to change the stroke
width of all the icon SVGs.

8
00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:37.246
Right, and
not just the icon in the frame, but

9
00:00:37.246 --> 00:00:42.479
the actual like each SVG kind
of like Stroke and fill.

10
00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.106
And so some of these tools become
really cuz there's hundreds of them and

11
00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:48.671
I'm not gonna sit around and
they're very small.

12
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:51.787
And I'm not going to play a game of
operation and try to get each and

13
00:00:51.787 --> 00:00:52.360
every one.

14
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.920
I will probably use
some of these tools for

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.794
trying to easily and
quickly select things.

16
00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:04.350
So, the only thing about this trick
is that whatever you're looking for,

17
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.677
they do need to be in a frame together.

18
00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:09.749
If you just had a bunch of stuff
on the canvas and try this,

19
00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:13.604
it won't necessarily work, they do
need to be in the bounds of a frame.

20
00:01:13.604 --> 00:01:16.554
But once you have that in place,

21
00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:22.873
you can go ahead and
whether it's in the edit menu or

22
00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:28.415
with that command palette,
you can do the select all with, right?

23
00:01:28.415 --> 00:01:31.000
And you've got a bunch of
different options here, okay,

24
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.127
go get me all the ones
with the same properties.

25
00:01:33.127 --> 00:01:37.450
Now, these are very uniform rectangles
that will work great in this case.

26
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.996
Select all the ones with the same fill,
right?

27
00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:47.227
Same strokes, same effects, effect is like
box shadows and stuff like that, right?

28
00:01:47.227 --> 00:01:50.650
So if I did select all
the same properties,

29
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.747
you can see that it's got it's grabbed
all of the cyan rectangles, right?

30
00:01:56.747 --> 00:02:02.316
So I can get them all very easily here
as well, and I can put them back.

31
00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:08.306
The other interesting thing that we can
do, if I grab the frame as a whole,

32
00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:14.800
you can see that it'll show me a summary
of all of the colors being used, right?

33
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.986
And I can go ahead and see this little
target and it will go ahead and

34
00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:24.998
select all of the frames that
are using that red color, right?

35
00:02:24.998 --> 00:02:26.021
And I can change that.

36
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:30.205
The other nice thing is that if you
are doing some kind of like large scale

37
00:02:30.205 --> 00:02:35.016
change, in this selection colors piece, I
can go ahead and I can click this one and

38
00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:36.371
I can go and switch it.

39
00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:38.931
These are colors that
I have from a library.

40
00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:42.098
So if you don't see these colors this
because we have not set up a color

41
00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:42.763
palette yet.

42
00:02:42.763 --> 00:02:46.930
We will, don't worry, but
I live in the future, right?

43
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.826
And so by selecting red and
going into this library here,

44
00:02:50.826 --> 00:02:53.515
I can change them all to green, right?

45
00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:57.735
So if you wanna to wholesale just
replace one color, super useful for

46
00:02:57.735 --> 00:03:01.978
just taking the entire frame, and
just swapping out that one color.

47
00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:05.273
Or you could also theoretically, if you
needed to get all the red buttons and

48
00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:08.431
then change something about their padding,
you could use this target.

49
00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:12.915
Or you can do the select all
with same property, same fill,

50
00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:18.398
depending on what you use cases,
that will all work in this case as well.

51
00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:23.727
But yeah, a lot of times either target or
that select is really useful for that.

52
00:03:23.727 --> 00:03:27.228
Yet we talked about some of these a little
pro tips that hidden here, if you want to

53
00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:30.540
see the distance between two objects
kind of more in a more practical sense.

54
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.484
You can whether it's 64 and
64 is split evenly

55
00:03:35.484 --> 00:03:39.729
spaced out, cool, a select all of those.

56
00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:44.277
So quick to try it out for a second and
try to grab all of the cyan ones and

57
00:03:44.277 --> 00:03:46.327
change something about them.

58
00:03:51.297 --> 00:03:55.110
All right, few more tasting notes on
selecting stuff because not being able to

59
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.788
select the thing you want
is incredibly frustrating.

60
00:03:57.788 --> 00:04:01.513
So spending a few more seconds
kind of going up some tips and

61
00:04:01.513 --> 00:04:03.194
tricks is super worth it.

62
00:04:03.194 --> 00:04:08.466
If I wanted to actually grab the frame,
maybe you can feel the anger

63
00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:13.284
as I click repeatedly and
I don't select the frame, right?

64
00:04:13.284 --> 00:04:15.874
I could go up here and click over here and

65
00:04:15.874 --> 00:04:20.977
now I've got the entire rectangles frame
selected, or I can hold COMMAND and

66
00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:25.555
then that is literally whatever is
under your mouse cursor, right?

67
00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:27.747
Will be selected, right?

68
00:04:27.747 --> 00:04:31.170
And so if you know exactly what you want,

69
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.801
then you can go ahead and
select it as well.

70
00:04:34.801 --> 00:04:40.121
And when we have even spacing like this,
you can see that is figured out like, hey,

71
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:45.535
Steve, you have a bunch of stuff that's
space 64 pixels from each other, right?

72
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:50.244
You can go ahead and
just adjust that here as well.

73
00:04:50.244 --> 00:04:54.236
Similarly, now that will only appear
if they are evenly spaced and

74
00:04:54.236 --> 00:04:56.173
Figma can figure out what to do.

75
00:04:56.173 --> 00:04:57.945
And so if you don't see it,

76
00:04:57.945 --> 00:05:02.880
it's maybe cuz you have something off
by one pixel So, so either go ahead and

77
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.063
hit that, like, distribute evenly or
something else as well.

78
00:05:07.063 --> 00:05:11.752
If it's vertical or tidy up,
what have you, you can adjust those.

79
00:05:11.752 --> 00:05:17.107
The other thing is selecting will
kind of grab all of the ones that

80
00:05:17.107 --> 00:05:22.869
you're hovering over,
unless you grab like a full parent, right?

81
00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:26.039
So once I got big enough
grabbed the entire frame, but

82
00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.929
like when I'm just grabbing
ones that are kind of

83
00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:32.962
not big enough to capture the entire
frame and grab a subset inside.

84
00:05:32.962 --> 00:05:37.547
Very similar to other things
you might use a holding SHIFT,

85
00:05:37.547 --> 00:05:41.215
select multiple things,
you can also shift and

86
00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:46.000
command to grab,
combine any of these keystrokes together.

87
00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.032
And it all worked away that you
might hope or expect that it would.

88
00:05:51.032 --> 00:05:56.498
And with that, we have, for
the most part, covered all of the really

89
00:05:56.498 --> 00:06:01.416
glamorous selecting inspector acting and
adjusting stuff.

90
00:06:01.416 --> 00:06:05.859
That one needs to do in order to do
slightly more complicated things without

91
00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:07.913
getting incredibly frustrated.
