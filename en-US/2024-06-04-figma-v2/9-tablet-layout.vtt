1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.206
The interesting thing
is how layout grids and

2
00:00:04.206 --> 00:00:08.918
constraints play nicely with each other,
right?

3
00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:13.749
So this is an example that we
kinda talked about in the very

4
00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:19.186
beginning of this little section,
where I've got effectively

5
00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:24.118
two columns in my grid and
I've got this idea of a top bar and

6
00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:28.271
a bottom bar and
a little bit of spacing going on.

7
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:31.448
So if we look at the amount
of grids in this one,

8
00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.136
I've theoretically got three grids,

9
00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:39.931
those two columns that are gonna stretch
based on the size of the container, right?

10
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:42.061
So they grow and
shrink with the container.

11
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:47.814
And the one row is effectively, we'll
take a look at the margins in a second.

12
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:52.584
But I'm saying the top bar and the bottom
bar are 48 pixels, right, whatever.

13
00:00:52.584 --> 00:00:54.300
You choose whatever you want.

14
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.341
And then this one in the middle stretches,

15
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:04.661
and it's got a margin
of 80 which is the 48

16
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:09.853
plus 32 for the spacing before it starts.

17
00:01:09.853 --> 00:01:14.427
And the reason that I had that math
in my head is because I originally

18
00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:16.070
did that math, right?

19
00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:21.127
And you can get the number like that,
you do not have to sit there,

20
00:01:21.127 --> 00:01:23.775
I used to sit there with a pencil and
paper before I realized I could do that.

21
00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.057
And there are other tools where
you can't type in the numbers and

22
00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:27.717
they now drive me insane
cuz I'm used to this.

23
00:01:27.717 --> 00:01:28.263
So, yeah.

24
00:01:28.263 --> 00:01:31.173
And 20, 24 pixel, gutter,
choose whatever you want.

25
00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:34.932
You can kind of do
the math as you need to.

26
00:01:34.932 --> 00:01:37.598
Awesome, so we've got that in place.

27
00:01:37.598 --> 00:01:42.324
It's effectively for grids, but
it's starting to look like a website

28
00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:45.788
layout despite the fact that
if I turn the grids off,

29
00:01:45.788 --> 00:01:49.116
it's actually secretly an empty frame,
right?

30
00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:52.718
But it's got the kind of
structure that I eventually need.

31
00:01:52.718 --> 00:01:57.340
And what I wanna do is take kind of what I
had before in those earlier examples and

32
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.314
create something that now works with two
columns, because all those constraints,

33
00:02:02.314 --> 00:02:07.171
if you're just in a frame with no grid,
the constraints follow the frame itself.

34
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:10.416
If you've got layout grids,
the constraints will actually work with

35
00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:12.672
the layout grid and
the column that they're in.

36
00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:17.229
And then it'll be either top-left,
bottom-right or whatever, of the actual

37
00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:21.597
layout grid that you're in, right,
which gives us a lot more flexibility.

38
00:02:21.597 --> 00:02:23.451
So I'm going to go ahead and

39
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:27.655
I can kind of re-implement
something similar to down below.

40
00:02:27.655 --> 00:02:28.876
And these are the new and

41
00:02:28.876 --> 00:02:32.437
improved ones that we kind of built
in the previous section, right?

42
00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:37.344
They expand as one would think,
similarly with this as well.

43
00:02:37.344 --> 00:02:40.369
Cool, and
you don't see any constraints in them yet

44
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.203
because they're not inside of a frame,
right?

45
00:02:43.203 --> 00:02:46.764
You had to put them in a frame
that doesn't have auto layout.

46
00:02:46.764 --> 00:02:49.235
We haven't talked about auto layout yet,
so don't worry about it.

47
00:02:49.235 --> 00:02:53.555
They have to be in a frame to
actually see any of the constraints.

48
00:02:53.555 --> 00:02:56.972
A lot of Figma's tooling
is context specific.

49
00:02:56.972 --> 00:02:59.888
So if you're in something that
doesn't support it, you don't see it.

50
00:02:59.888 --> 00:03:03.848
A lot of times what you're looking for
probably involves a bean in a frame.

51
00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:08.070
If you're trying to select all the same
properties and you see that grayed out,

52
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.305
it's because it's just in this empty
void of a space, not inside of anything.

53
00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:17.121
Cool, so let's start with
the navigation because it's

54
00:03:17.121 --> 00:03:21.146
not too much different
from what we did before.

55
00:03:21.146 --> 00:03:24.008
And go ahead, and I can drag this in.

56
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:31.445
And we change the size of this,
but that's fine.

57
00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:35.052
And so one thing is you notice that my
navbar, because I was playing around with

58
00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:37.786
the size of the tablet smaller
than the completed example,

59
00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:39.548
I can't really get to that edge of it.

60
00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:43.483
If I turned off Clip Content for a second,

61
00:03:43.483 --> 00:03:49.223
I can then see the edge of it, and
I can go ahead and drag it in.

62
00:03:49.223 --> 00:03:53.059
And this has the constraints in
place that are keeping all of those

63
00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:55.722
little icons where they ought to be,
right?

64
00:03:55.722 --> 00:04:00.137
Cuz if you look at these icons here,
they are,

65
00:04:00.137 --> 00:04:03.420
go up one, two, notifications,

66
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.529
they are,
they're in actually an auto layout.

67
00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.072
Cool, so I've got that in place now.

68
00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:12.400
I wanna set the constraints here.

69
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.304
So top and to the left,
I know that I want left and right.

70
00:04:20.315 --> 00:04:22.059
All right, so that's doing what I want.

71
00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:24.688
We'll do the same for
the bottom navigation.

72
00:04:24.688 --> 00:04:27.976
And again, having these grids in place,
now I don't have to guess,

73
00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.712
cuz again, these are the right
size because I know that.

74
00:04:30.712 --> 00:04:33.090
But if I was just trying
to draw new frames,

75
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.598
knowing that I don't have to measure 48
pixels cuz I have a grid setup is great.

76
00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:39.181
So here we go.

77
00:04:39.181 --> 00:04:42.992
The other thing you can do is if
you just click this right here,

78
00:04:42.992 --> 00:04:47.483
it'll set it to the bottom as well,
if you don't wanna do the drop down.

79
00:04:50.571 --> 00:04:55.273
You can hold Shift and
then do the left and the right.

80
00:04:55.273 --> 00:04:56.435
There's things that are muscle memory.

81
00:04:56.435 --> 00:04:59.799
As soon as I have to say out loud,
I'm like, what do I hold to do that?

82
00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.578
[LAUGH] I used to, like,
when I'm trying to teach,

83
00:05:02.578 --> 00:05:06.211
just do this motion with my hand and
be like, you just do that.

84
00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:08.124
And I'm, like,
realize that doesn't make sense anyone.

85
00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:13.316
So you can hit both sides by holding Shift
and you'd get the left and the right.

86
00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:17.311
Now, again, like we had before,
our navbar works.

87
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:23.572
Now where the magic happens here
is we can grab these posts,

88
00:05:23.572 --> 00:05:28.094
right, and I can go ahead and
drag that in.

89
00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:30.719
And we can get it aligned.

90
00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.216
So up along the top there with
that where that grid starts.

91
00:05:35.216 --> 00:05:38.465
Got this one is what, no.

92
00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:43.795
And we'll go ahead and
put that in place as well.

93
00:05:43.795 --> 00:05:48.129
And you can see that this one
is a little bit too small.

94
00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:55.946
Of course we put that in the grid as well.

95
00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:58.715
Make sure that's all aligned just right.

96
00:05:58.715 --> 00:06:02.209
Cool, everything snaps,
where my grid happens to be in place.

97
00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:09.140
Now let's make this one work as well.

98
00:06:11.142 --> 00:06:13.740
Cool, all right, so
they're roughly the same size now.

99
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.419
Grab these other two.

100
00:06:22.021 --> 00:06:23.217
Pop them in here.

101
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.808
It's okay if it overflows slightly.

102
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:35.177
We'll deal with that in a second.

103
00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:38.311
Like a lot of times you don't mind it
overflowing, cuz if we're setting up

104
00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:41.316
a prototype that has scrolling,
that's like slightly intentional.

105
00:06:41.316 --> 00:06:45.725
Cool, so we'll pop that in there as well,
align it all like that.

106
00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:52.884
And get that in place now, because I
was resizing them all willy nilly.

107
00:06:52.884 --> 00:06:55.716
I could select all four of these.

108
00:06:55.716 --> 00:06:58.008
And you can see that
the heights are mixed.

109
00:06:58.008 --> 00:07:04.308
Let's say, I don't really know what I
want the height to be, let's say 420.

110
00:07:04.308 --> 00:07:09.137
Cool, I don't know what
they were originally.

111
00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:11.938
And then I can space them out evenly.

112
00:07:11.938 --> 00:07:15.539
Now with this, because I could have
multiple and they might flow, it's

113
00:07:15.539 --> 00:07:19.568
a little bit trickier because the height
could change depending on the content.

114
00:07:19.568 --> 00:07:23.444
But I could theoretically have a grid that
had the rose as I would want as well, and

115
00:07:23.444 --> 00:07:25.214
maybe we can try that out in a second.

116
00:07:25.214 --> 00:07:32.178
But generally speaking, we're trying to
get the kind of feel of a page in place.

117
00:07:32.178 --> 00:07:34.114
So now with these, now they're in,

118
00:07:34.114 --> 00:07:37.183
they're kinda snapped into
their grid columns, right?

119
00:07:37.183 --> 00:07:38.722
And kinda see as well.

120
00:07:41.307 --> 00:07:48.356
Especially if you kinda scroll in, you can
kinda see, Let's snap them all into place.

121
00:07:48.356 --> 00:07:51.133
Sweet, cool.

122
00:07:59.281 --> 00:08:00.801
Awesome.

123
00:08:05.947 --> 00:08:11.463
So what we're gonna say here is we want
them to kinda behave like a webpage,

124
00:08:11.463 --> 00:08:14.278
which is don't grow if we got taller.

125
00:08:14.278 --> 00:08:17.846
But definitely if these columns expand,
right,

126
00:08:20.936 --> 00:08:24.353
I want them to kinda grow with
the width of the column, right?

127
00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:26.858
And stay where they are in
terms of the height, but

128
00:08:26.858 --> 00:08:28.597
grow with the width of the column.

129
00:08:28.597 --> 00:08:32.811
Cool, so let's go ahead and do that.

130
00:08:32.811 --> 00:08:34.888
So we can grab all four of these.

131
00:08:36.898 --> 00:08:40.635
And we're gonna say again that they
have left and right constraints and

132
00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:42.137
they should stay at the top.

133
00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:44.090
So I chose to center them, but

134
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.555
I think the other important part
with the layout grid is two things.

135
00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:53.028
One thing, most primarily, and
I'll show you a second thing in a second,

136
00:08:53.028 --> 00:08:55.727
which is that trying to
get to the right side.

137
00:08:55.727 --> 00:08:58.239
Imagine now if I had five columns, right?

138
00:08:58.239 --> 00:09:01.522
I don't wanna get to the right width of
each and every one of these things having

139
00:09:01.522 --> 00:09:03.530
Intermediate points that
I can stamp stuff to.

140
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.808
In this case the columns are centered,
and so I used a center constraint on

141
00:09:07.808 --> 00:09:12.579
the items as well, and that actually gives
me the effect that I want super easily.

142
00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:16.394
There is one edge case that
I have to deal with here.

143
00:09:16.394 --> 00:09:21.101
And that is the idea
that I can get too small.

144
00:09:21.101 --> 00:09:23.427
And that's not great.

145
00:09:23.427 --> 00:09:27.300
But we can see ways to handle
that when we get to auto layout,

146
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.643
which is gonna make this a lot easier for
us as well.
