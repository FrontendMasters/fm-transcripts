00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.559
So we've got the kind of the fundamentals
of components, but it kind of gets

2
00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:07.302
a little bit interesting when we kind of
start to build them up a little bit more.

3
00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:11.960
So, one of the things you
can do with components

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.694
is this idea of a component property.

5
00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:17.357
Again, this is where our lives get easy.

6
00:00:17.357 --> 00:00:20.955
It's almost as a Figma
was built by engineers.

7
00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:26.646
And so some of the terms I introduce into
Figma are terms that engineers use, which,

8
00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:32.276
as a bunch of engineers learning how to
use Figma, makes our lives easier, right?

9
00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:36.664
So if I said component property and
you thought in your head,

10
00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:41.493
is that like a prop in React,
we're done, yeah, yes, exactly.

11
00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:47.086
Now, the nuances of how to use them
is a little bit more than that,

12
00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:50.151
but the concept is mostly the same.

13
00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:55.349
So before we had that session
card that we made responsive

14
00:00:55.349 --> 00:01:00.673
to great effect, and
it had these little badges or pills.

15
00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:03.530
You see them in auto completes,
you see them all over the place.

16
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.580
After the button,

17
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.120
it's the second most common thing after
styling input fields that you kinda see.

18
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.691
And so let's say we wanted the option
to we wanna use some component

19
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.247
properties in there.

20
00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:19.685
So let's go ahead and actually we'll start
with actually just the text cuz then I can

21
00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:21.137
do that auto layout trick.

22
00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:28.138
And we'll say that we have badge.

23
00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:30.132
We'll say Shift+A.

24
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.646
Again, some of the stuff
we've seen before,

25
00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:36.810
I could say apply variable cozy padding.

26
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.473
That's the gap, I don't want that.

27
00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:42.711
At some point we'd need more variables.

28
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:43.784
If I copy and paste,

29
00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:47.392
there's an import export variables
feature which is super great.

30
00:01:47.392 --> 00:01:50.440
You can take the spacing stuff they
made before and pull in all the spacing.

31
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.884
Also, if you have an existing set of
components that use variables, and

32
00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:57.390
you copy and paste them between Figma
files, guess what you get for free?

33
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.895
Any variables that those
components referenced.

34
00:01:59.895 --> 00:02:04.791
So if you find you need to port variables
over, you can have something like a set of

35
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.823
layers that reference a bunch of
variables like a spacing chart and

36
00:02:08.823 --> 00:02:13.225
copy paste that or you can import and
export the variables with a plug in.

37
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:15.072
You can take that tool that I made,

38
00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:17.827
get a full set of all
the values that you might need.

39
00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:22.728
But all that is a little bit too tedious
and not the main point at this point.

40
00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:27.763
So we'll use our roundedness though,
and cozy padding is probably

41
00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:32.196
a little bit aggressive for
a badge, but let's go with it.

42
00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:34.704
Great, it does need a fill, so

43
00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:39.052
let's go ahead and
use one of our variables for that.

44
00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:41.664
Let's go with primary 100.

45
00:02:41.664 --> 00:02:44.518
So looks kind of like a badge.

46
00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:49.420
Now, let's say that I wanted
to give it a toggle for

47
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.308
whether or not we should show a hashtag.

48
00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:57.454
That session card,
maybe it's hashtag JavaScript,

49
00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:00.256
hashtag Figma, hashtag whatever.

50
00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.902
So let's try that out for a second.

51
00:03:02.902 --> 00:03:10.041
There's a hash tag icon in most
component libraries as well.

52
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.430
Let's just make this for instead.

53
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.306
Cool.

54
00:03:15.306 --> 00:03:22.362
So what I wanna do now is I wanna say,
hey, let's make this is a component.

55
00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:28.099
And Command Option K makes it a component.

56
00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:33.231
You can see that now that I have
components on more than one page,

57
00:03:33.231 --> 00:03:37.905
it's using the page names to
create a hierarchy for them.

58
00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:40.817
I can create a badge.

59
00:03:40.817 --> 00:03:42.308
Now this badge is fine.

60
00:03:42.308 --> 00:03:43.031
It works.

61
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:46.605
I could probably stand to use a drop
shadow, cuz you I like those, and

62
00:03:46.605 --> 00:03:48.651
maybe a little border, I don't know.

63
00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:50.517
But it works for our purposes.

64
00:03:50.517 --> 00:03:52.422
But I want to do things.

65
00:03:52.422 --> 00:03:52.995
Right now,

66
00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:56.847
the fact that they can change the hashtag
to anything is probably problematic.

67
00:03:56.847 --> 00:04:00.708
And to be clear, in Figma, you can
guide people in the right direction,

68
00:04:00.708 --> 00:04:03.703
if you wanna stop people,
it's not even worth trying.

69
00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:04.922
But we can guide people.

70
00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:09.797
And so if we go here, check this out,
there's a new pane here.

71
00:04:09.797 --> 00:04:12.357
It's called properties.

72
00:04:12.357 --> 00:04:15.447
I can add a bunch of properties.

73
00:04:15.447 --> 00:04:18.376
Let's start with boolean.

74
00:04:18.376 --> 00:04:20.915
Boolean is a true or false value.

75
00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:26.841
Text is a String, so
let's say Boolean which is

76
00:04:31.956 --> 00:04:33.811
Is hashtag one word or two?

77
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:35.278
What's the consensus in the room?

78
00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:36.807
We're going with one.

79
00:04:36.807 --> 00:04:39.963
And we'll say it but its value is false.

80
00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:42.226
And that can go on this layer.

81
00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:45.690
And you can see I got this little
subtle icon that I probably would

82
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.136
have never noticed before.

83
00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:50.820
It says apply Boolean property,
which is a hashtag, and

84
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.523
that was set to false by default, right?

85
00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:56.042
So now if I go to any of these components,

86
00:04:56.042 --> 00:05:01.101
I have a toggle where I can toggle whether
or not it should have the Boolean or not.

87
00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:05.096
Right, and so those are all and
they're independent.

88
00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:08.059
They're basically props passed
into each and every one of these.

89
00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:10.337
The other thing we can do is, as we said,

90
00:05:10.337 --> 00:05:12.891
I can change this to whatever I want,
right?

91
00:05:12.891 --> 00:05:14.564
And for a button or a badge, that's fine,

92
00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:17.183
let them double-click,
let them change to string, no big deal.

93
00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:22.115
But let's say we had a whole big component
with maybe a lot of default text, and

94
00:05:22.115 --> 00:05:25.654
maybe one or two areas that
you might want to customize.

95
00:05:25.654 --> 00:05:26.990
You can do that as well.

96
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.155
So you can go ahead like we did before and
go to properties and hit the plus sign,

97
00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:32.796
but we're not gonna do that for

98
00:05:32.796 --> 00:05:36.606
a hot minute because I'm gonna show
you you can also work the other way.

99
00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:39.757
Which is I can go ahead to this here, and

100
00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:44.532
because this is a component,
it says the text is badge, but

101
00:05:44.532 --> 00:05:49.614
I can also click this and
say the name is, let's call it label.

102
00:05:49.614 --> 00:05:53.897
Right, and so now this is mapped to
that component property of label,

103
00:05:53.897 --> 00:05:56.594
which happens to currently
be set to badge.

104
00:05:56.594 --> 00:06:00.756
But here, I can go to this one,
and now you've got the hashtag.

105
00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:08.083
Right, and so if you only wanna
target very specific strings,

106
00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:10.445
right, you can do that here as well.

107
00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:13.464
And there's some crazy stuff that
you can do with this that you're not

108
00:06:13.464 --> 00:06:16.329
thinking about that we're getting to,
cuz you're like, yeah,

109
00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:18.493
I could have just
double-clicked on the string.

110
00:06:18.493 --> 00:06:22.081
But in a big long thing,
it's very nice, but

111
00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:26.909
there would be some wild stuff
we'll see a little bit later.
