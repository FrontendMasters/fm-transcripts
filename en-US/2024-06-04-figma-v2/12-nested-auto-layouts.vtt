00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:05.780
So we alluded to nested auto layouts in
our riff during auto layout part one,

2
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.029
but let's kind of take a little bit of
a deeper dive and do it in our nest.

3
00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:16.944
So I've got spare parts of
two different ideas here.

4
00:00:16.944 --> 00:00:22.143
One is a nav bar, and the other one
is what looks like those components

5
00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:28.345
that we're playing around with when we're
doing constraints and layout grids.

6
00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:31.479
Except with those,
there's a little bit of work already done,

7
00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:33.288
there was some auto layout in place.

8
00:00:33.288 --> 00:00:38.429
With these, this is just literally all
of the spare pieces laying around,

9
00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.948
and it's on us to kind of
re-put it back together.

10
00:00:41.948 --> 00:00:46.986
So the plan action here is I'm
going to kinda show you the process

11
00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:52.025
of using nested auto layouts to
kind of recreate the photogram,

12
00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:57.250
which apparently was not taken,
post, and then you can take it for

13
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.602
a spin by creating a navigation bar or
something along those lines.

14
00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:06.370
And so there's some pieces laying
around if you try out with that.

15
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.857
But with that,
there are a bunch of kind of nested auto

16
00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:14.863
layout components that
we need to think about.

17
00:01:14.863 --> 00:01:17.801
So before we just start going and
throwing it all together,

18
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:19.575
let's talk about a plan of attack.

19
00:01:19.575 --> 00:01:21.907
They are at least somewhat like,

20
00:01:21.907 --> 00:01:25.989
when I left the spare parts around,
I did at least arranged

21
00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:30.595
them in an order that looked somewhat
like what I intend to build.

22
00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:35.081
So we kind of pieces out kinda like
the same way we would if we looked at

23
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:39.412
a design and thought about the DOM
elements or React components or

24
00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:42.740
a Svelte components or
what have you components.

25
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.336
We've kinda got this top bar, right,
but these two are kind of nested and

26
00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:47.503
related to each other.

27
00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:53.004
So I'm thinking right here this
is one auto layout frame, right,

28
00:01:53.004 --> 00:01:58.227
that exists inside of one that has
the full top bar of the image.

29
00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:02.204
We can argue whether or
not the image itself is one.

30
00:02:02.204 --> 00:02:06.525
Then we get down here and we have a very
similar concept to what we saw before

31
00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:11.143
where we got three things that we wanna be
able to slot a new one in or remove one.

32
00:02:11.143 --> 00:02:16.123
And so this feels like a little auto
layout piece here as well that exists

33
00:02:16.123 --> 00:02:17.286
in a longer bar.

34
00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:23.706
And then probably something similar
here inside of the card itself,

35
00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:29.471
right, which is vertical as
these things stacked together.

36
00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:33.771
I wish that was a picture of a hamburger,
that would better illustrate my point, but

37
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:35.477
that's not how stock art works.

38
00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:39.868
I'll also show you how
to kinda generate sample

39
00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:44.805
content in a little bit as
well as a little side quest,

40
00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:48.663
maybe when we have completed this piece.

41
00:02:48.663 --> 00:02:53.009
But with that, we can start to
assemble the various pieces.

42
00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:58.664
So we'll grab all of this and
let's take it out of that section,

43
00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:03.185
just we can kinda see what we have and
have not used.

44
00:03:03.185 --> 00:03:07.165
I left my very important
screen name behind.

45
00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:11.143
Okay, so this is how I would
probably go about this.

46
00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:15.345
And I don't always end up with
a situation where I'm starting with

47
00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:18.507
all the various pieces,
but a lot of times, I do.

48
00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:21.031
In this case we can kinda start
to select various parts and

49
00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:22.299
put them together, right?

50
00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.206
So we know that this is
effectively one auto layout piece.

51
00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:29.507
I'll usually start with the smallest
ones and work my way out.

52
00:03:29.507 --> 00:03:32.687
So I can grab these two,
I can just hit Shift+A,

53
00:03:32.687 --> 00:03:37.980
which both puts them in a frame together
and also makes that an auto layout frame.

54
00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.806
And so we can call this one,
Frame 1 is fine in context,

55
00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:46.114
but let me tell you how the story ends.

56
00:03:46.114 --> 00:03:49.040
You've got to design with a bunch of
Frame 1, frame this, frame that, and

57
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.429
you can't make sense of anything.

58
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:55.376
So we'll call this one User.

59
00:03:55.376 --> 00:03:57.384
I don't know.

60
00:03:57.384 --> 00:03:59.391
You know what's harder than
live coding and live designing?

61
00:03:59.391 --> 00:04:01.855
Live naming things in front of people.

62
00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:05.744
All right, in here,
it's got a space of 32.

63
00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:07.645
That feels like a bit much.

64
00:04:07.645 --> 00:04:10.684
Let's try 8.

65
00:04:10.684 --> 00:04:14.296
And then we want to align
it in the center so

66
00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:18.437
that we got the text
aligned up with the avatar.

67
00:04:18.437 --> 00:04:24.593
I mean, so far so good, now that exists
in context with this piece here.

68
00:04:24.593 --> 00:04:31.381
Now, you could argue should I
make this an auto layout frame?

69
00:04:31.381 --> 00:04:36.721
On one hand, you can argue no, because
it's one thing, what are you doing, right?

70
00:04:36.721 --> 00:04:39.918
You could also argue future you
might put future things in there.

71
00:04:39.918 --> 00:04:42.528
That's the engineer in your head talking,
and you can listen to it or

72
00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:43.209
not listen to it.

73
00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:44.590
I don't really care.

74
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.765
We're gonna skip it just
in the sake of like,

75
00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:49.297
I know that we will not be
iterating on this forever.

76
00:04:49.297 --> 00:04:52.137
But if it was a design that you
plan on using for a longer time,

77
00:04:52.137 --> 00:04:54.614
you could choose to look,
he's gonna do it anyway.

78
00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:58.523
Make that a frame as well
with the same kind of rules.

79
00:04:58.523 --> 00:05:02.837
We'll make that right
aligned in the center.

80
00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:06.678
We'll keep the value in there.

81
00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:08.536
We'll look at variables in a little bit.

82
00:05:08.536 --> 00:05:12.507
That'll show you how to use one valuable
multiple places, so if you knew how

83
00:05:12.507 --> 00:05:16.675
to change the consistent icon spacing
across your entire app, you can do that.

84
00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.708
But we're not there yet.

85
00:05:19.708 --> 00:05:24.628
So we've got that in place,
that's a row, it's aligned.

86
00:05:24.628 --> 00:05:31.167
We're given at this point no padding,
I can choose to change that later.

87
00:05:31.167 --> 00:05:33.417
But at this moment that feels right.

88
00:05:33.417 --> 00:05:35.501
And now we can grab these
two things together.

89
00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.812
And again,
that becomes an auto layout frame.

90
00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:43.000
And what's kinda nice is that I've mostly
figured out what to do in this case.

91
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.538
So we've got this frame,
again, it's called Frame 1.

92
00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:54.005
Cool, and that actually made
my vector a auto layout frame,

93
00:05:54.005 --> 00:05:56.159
which is not what I want.

94
00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:58.977
All right, so we'll go ahead and
turn that back.

95
00:05:58.977 --> 00:06:00.392
We'll wrap this one in a frame.

96
00:06:00.392 --> 00:06:03.738
So I'm gonna hit Command+Option+G.

97
00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.319
And now that's inside of a frame.

98
00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.981
And we can make that an auto layout.

99
00:06:07.981 --> 00:06:11.993
So now I can theoretically throw more
things in there as well with the 8.

100
00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:16.599
That way, before each and every one of my
street tacos was element inside of that

101
00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.478
frame that had the vector in it.

102
00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.724
And that's not what I wanted.

103
00:06:20.724 --> 00:06:26.410
Cool, every time I just tried to make
a ad hoc decision, I always regret it.

104
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.851
So I'll hit Shift+A again.

105
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:30.157
And now we've got these two together.

106
00:06:30.157 --> 00:06:35.642
And so you can see inside Frame 2, we've
got the user, and we've got the frame.

107
00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:38.653
Now things I hate about this,
it looks fine, but

108
00:06:38.653 --> 00:06:42.987
that's because it assumed that
since they were 211 pixels apart,

109
00:06:42.987 --> 00:06:46.453
that I want a gap of 211 between each and
everything.

110
00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:50.530
I do not want a gap of 211
between each and everything.

111
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.309
What I want is it to be auto.

112
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:56.471
So go ahead and we'll make that auto,

113
00:06:56.471 --> 00:07:01.145
which makes it fixed width instead of
hugged, and then we will center it, right?

114
00:07:01.145 --> 00:07:03.912
And you can see that the iconography
changes a little bit and

115
00:07:03.912 --> 00:07:06.134
some of them all collapsed
together with a gap.

116
00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:07.358
They are literally spread out.

117
00:07:07.358 --> 00:07:11.924
So there's effectively a space
between here as well in

118
00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:15.111
terms of the way they're justified.

119
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:15.904
Cool, cool, cool.

120
00:07:15.904 --> 00:07:17.971
And we'll say More Options.

121
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:19.803
I don't know what to call this.

122
00:07:19.803 --> 00:07:21.609
Cool, so we've got that in place and

123
00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:24.127
then we can do something
similar down here as well.

124
00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:29.992
So we'll grab these three and we will
add them into an auto layout frame.

125
00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:32.601
Yeah, let's call that,

126
00:07:37.787 --> 00:07:41.951
Nope, I grabbed, let's actually
wrap them in a frame together.

127
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:45.906
So Command+Option+G for me, or you can
just literally choose to right-click

128
00:07:45.906 --> 00:07:47.894
the three of them, wrap them in a frame.

129
00:07:47.894 --> 00:07:52.202
But I'm learning that the just
Shift+A on a vector will then,

130
00:07:52.202 --> 00:07:54.494
it tries to be a little too smart.

131
00:07:54.494 --> 00:07:56.375
Cool, so we've got that in place.

132
00:07:56.375 --> 00:08:02.848
We'll call this one Sharing Options, or
social engagement, whatever you want.

133
00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:04.248
Because it's comment sharing,
I don't know.

134
00:08:05.338 --> 00:08:08.095
And, again, we'll wrap that in a frame, so

135
00:08:08.095 --> 00:08:12.318
we can do the same thing we did with
those three tacos up there as well.

136
00:08:13.808 --> 00:08:19.616
Cool, and so
we can grab all of these as well.

137
00:08:19.616 --> 00:08:21.454
And those are now in an auto layout.

138
00:08:21.454 --> 00:08:23.089
All right, I need to wrap these on frames.

139
00:08:23.089 --> 00:08:28.814
That works with text and
it does not work as well.

140
00:08:28.814 --> 00:08:32.452
So now it's in a frame that
we've added auto layout to.

141
00:08:32.452 --> 00:08:35.570
Cool, and again,
we have the same problems we had before.

142
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.143
So we'll say auto, and

143
00:08:37.143 --> 00:08:41.561
now you can see that kinda space
that is been added in there as well.

144
00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:44.052
There's no text, don't make it
seem that they're not aligned,

145
00:08:44.052 --> 00:08:46.281
because they're all icons that
happen to be the same size.

146
00:08:46.281 --> 00:08:50.542
But future me is going to wanna make
sure that they're aligned center.

147
00:08:50.542 --> 00:08:54.271
All right, finally we got this one,
and you can be like,

148
00:08:54.271 --> 00:08:56.231
this doesn't need to be one.

149
00:08:56.231 --> 00:09:00.795
I'm gonna argue that it should be one,
for reasons I'll show you in a second.

150
00:09:00.795 --> 00:09:07.429
So say likes, this will be engagement.

151
00:09:07.429 --> 00:09:10.257
That sounds like a businessey term, right?

152
00:09:10.257 --> 00:09:14.060
Awesome, and so we've got all
of these pieces involved here,

153
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.598
but now we need the kind of larger piece
as well, so I can select all of them.

154
00:09:18.598 --> 00:09:20.934
Certainly look like a card.

155
00:09:20.934 --> 00:09:27.620
Command+Option+G to wrap it in a frame,
and we'll say Photo Card.

156
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:30.897
And now we add an auto layout to that.

157
00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:36.583
Cool, and so
now that has assumed that we want to go,

158
00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:40.477
it assumes that we wanna have 24.

159
00:09:40.477 --> 00:09:43.263
We're gonna go 0.

160
00:09:43.263 --> 00:09:44.658
We can kind of adjust some stuff.

161
00:09:44.658 --> 00:09:47.910
I don't know that if I want the padding
in between each or not, but

162
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.645
I can notice some things that
are already annoying me.

163
00:09:50.645 --> 00:09:53.088
If I biggerize this a little bit,

164
00:09:53.088 --> 00:09:58.245
you can see that that's definitely
not doing what I want in this case.

165
00:09:58.245 --> 00:10:02.922
So we'll go ahead here, and
Instead of this having a fixed width,

166
00:10:02.922 --> 00:10:06.861
we'll go ahead and
have it fill the container, right?

167
00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:11.265
That's kinda like having a constraint, but
less about being attached to both sides

168
00:10:11.265 --> 00:10:14.069
and more about just take up
as much space as possible.

169
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:17.054
If we put a second thing in this row or
something along those lines,

170
00:10:17.054 --> 00:10:19.467
it would then share it,
kinda like divs in a flexbox.

171
00:10:21.588 --> 00:10:25.937
Here as well, we can do that.

172
00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:28.638
Awesome, and then we'll do it here, too.

173
00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:33.202
And what I'll do is if I
wanted the likes on this side,

174
00:10:33.202 --> 00:10:37.328
now I can kinda do some
interesting justification options.

175
00:10:37.328 --> 00:10:42.046
That's why I chose to put this text in
a flexbox because then I can choose, do I

176
00:10:42.046 --> 00:10:47.350
want it left justified, center justified,
or towards the end there, right?

177
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:51.900
Cool, so we'll have that in place as well.

178
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:56.542
And then this is currently
the fixed height, but really,

179
00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:59.573
if we double click on the bottom here,

180
00:10:59.573 --> 00:11:03.570
we can actually make it hug the contents,
right?

181
00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:06.992
But let's see.

182
00:11:06.992 --> 00:11:09.610
Now, what do we do about this image?

183
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.960
You cannot use constraints at
all in an auto layout frame.

184
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.490
So you cannot mix and match.

185
00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.040
You choose one path.

186
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.916
You can have an auto layout frame
inside of a regular one that has

187
00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:21.116
constraints, totally.

188
00:11:21.116 --> 00:11:26.246
But I can't necessarily bind it to
the size of the constraints cuz you'll

189
00:11:26.246 --> 00:11:31.559
see that, again, in the classic Figma
fashion, it's just gone, right?

190
00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:35.764
I happen to know that you cannot
use constraints in auto layout but

191
00:11:35.764 --> 00:11:39.442
if you didn't,
you think you're going slowly insane.

192
00:11:39.442 --> 00:11:43.584
So go ahead and
we'll make that an auto layout frame, too.

193
00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:47.630
And this point,
we are also going to fill the container.

194
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:53.432
And let's actually fill it this way,
too, so that if we choose to grow and

195
00:11:53.432 --> 00:11:59.157
shrink this, not dissimilar from
what I had with constraints, right?

196
00:11:59.157 --> 00:12:03.932
Now, then becomes a question of
how do I wanna deal with padding.

197
00:12:03.932 --> 00:12:05.224
I have two options, honestly.

198
00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:09.530
And I don't really have strong opinions,
so maybe if someone wants to vote for one,

199
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.813
we can do whichever one.

200
00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:11.909
I can add padding, I mean,

201
00:12:11.909 --> 00:12:14.502
I already know which one I want
cuz one's easier than the other.

202
00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:18.714
I can add padding to each of these
components here that I want to have some

203
00:12:18.714 --> 00:12:23.018
amount of padding, or I just put a gap and
space in between each of them.

204
00:12:23.018 --> 00:12:24.158
Do we have strong opinions?

205
00:12:24.158 --> 00:12:25.162
Which one do we wanna do?

206
00:12:26.739 --> 00:12:28.284
Cuz I'm gonna do the easier
one on the list.

207
00:12:28.284 --> 00:12:28.914
&gt;&gt; Gap.

208
00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:31.987
&gt;&gt; Gap, all right, and
if I regret it, we'll change it.

209
00:12:31.987 --> 00:12:37.348
So let's go ahead and
give that gap of, let's start with 8.

210
00:12:37.348 --> 00:12:40.683
Looks pretty good.

211
00:12:40.683 --> 00:12:41.966
Here's an interesting one.

212
00:12:41.966 --> 00:12:47.438
So now if I do the horizontal padding,

213
00:12:47.438 --> 00:12:54.110
right, then my image is also padded,
right?

214
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:58.551
Which doesn't look that bad now,
let's do it vertically as well.

215
00:13:00.028 --> 00:13:05.126
Doesn't look that bad now until I make
the fill color white or whatever.

216
00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:11.998
Sure, that works.

217
00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:16.167
And we can kinda see that
it's not my intended design.

218
00:13:16.167 --> 00:13:17.848
So that's not going to work.

219
00:13:19.013 --> 00:13:20.733
But, let's round the corner
while we're here, though.

220
00:13:23.453 --> 00:13:27.463
And we'll give it a little drop
shadow cuz we're worth it.

221
00:13:27.463 --> 00:13:29.263
So we wanna get rid of this.

222
00:13:29.263 --> 00:13:30.923
Does anyone know what the answer is?

223
00:13:32.403 --> 00:13:33.363
&gt;&gt; Negative margin.

224
00:13:33.363 --> 00:13:34.433
&gt;&gt; Negative margin?

225
00:13:34.433 --> 00:13:35.963
I didn't think about that,
let's try that out.

226
00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:38.546
What happens if I do?

227
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.355
Yeah, this one we say,
do 16 on the sides here or 8?

228
00:13:46.355 --> 00:13:52.547
Let's do, No dice.

229
00:13:52.547 --> 00:13:53.484
That's also the gap.

230
00:13:53.484 --> 00:13:57.841
So, No dice.

231
00:13:57.841 --> 00:13:59.279
I can't have a negative number in there.

232
00:14:00.698 --> 00:14:03.537
&gt;&gt; Uncheck Clip content.

233
00:14:03.537 --> 00:14:06.994
&gt;&gt; That will show it to me,
actually that doesn't even do it, but

234
00:14:06.994 --> 00:14:08.907
that's not gonna solve my issue.

235
00:14:08.907 --> 00:14:15.235
The answer is more auto layout,
[LAUGH] right?

236
00:14:15.235 --> 00:14:17.021
So, what are the suggesting?

237
00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:21.871
So instead of having a,
we'll back to a margin of 0.

238
00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:27.243
And then actually,
I could, this one's easy.

239
00:14:27.243 --> 00:14:30.393
We'll say this one gets the 8, right?

240
00:14:30.393 --> 00:14:31.573
So that looks good.

241
00:14:31.573 --> 00:14:34.664
And then the big question here is,
do I do it twice?

242
00:14:34.664 --> 00:14:37.785
Or do I wrap it in another auto layout?

243
00:14:37.785 --> 00:14:43.887
All right, and that one, what is going on?

244
00:14:43.887 --> 00:14:45.930
Click that, and then we're gonna say,

245
00:14:51.559 --> 00:14:54.200
Add auto layout to that one,
we can give this one an 8.

246
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.861
I could have done it each individual one,
but

247
00:14:55.861 --> 00:14:58.011
if I know that the entire bottom
section should have that.

248
00:14:58.011 --> 00:15:02.574
So basically, the top and the bottom are
their own layers that have that padding,

249
00:15:02.574 --> 00:15:05.832
but then the image is allowed
to go to the margins, right?

250
00:15:05.832 --> 00:15:08.688
So the overall card has no padding, right?

251
00:15:08.688 --> 00:15:11.478
But each part of this should have padding,
does.

252
00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:14.148
Could I have done it individually for
each one of these as well?

253
00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:16.150
I could have, but I like the idea.

254
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:19.137
If I decide to go up to 16, and
I don't have variables yet,

255
00:15:19.137 --> 00:15:21.490
then I'd have to do it
twice all over the place.

256
00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:26.437
I like the idea that no, we have all
the top content and all the bottom content

257
00:15:26.437 --> 00:15:31.249
in layers that have padding, and
I don't necessarily need to do it here.

258
00:15:31.249 --> 00:15:32.300
So that'll work.

259
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:41.622
And we have,
Do you know what else this needs?

260
00:15:41.622 --> 00:15:47.312
We need to give it a,
let's give it a min width of,

261
00:15:47.312 --> 00:15:50.436
why does he choose 375?

262
00:15:50.436 --> 00:15:55.289
Because that is, I think, the iPhone SE in
Chrome on the smallest responsive setting,

263
00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:59.827
and I've committed that to memory somehow,
and that is now the number that I use.

264
00:15:59.827 --> 00:16:01.287
You could choose a different number,

265
00:16:01.287 --> 00:16:03.976
but you wanna know why does
he picking that number?

266
00:16:03.976 --> 00:16:05.206
That's why.

267
00:16:05.206 --> 00:16:09.813
And let's say that the maximum
width of this is 640.

268
00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:12.346
I don't know, right?

269
00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:16.939
So now, it's got some constraints to,

270
00:16:16.939 --> 00:16:22.216
didn't mean to overuse
the word constraint.

271
00:16:22.216 --> 00:16:26.274
Not constraints in the Figma term,
constraints in the, just regular words,

272
00:16:26.274 --> 00:16:26.958
mean words.

273
00:16:26.958 --> 00:16:32.616
And we can also give that
component a minimum height,

274
00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:36.638
at least, maybe a maximum one, too,

275
00:16:36.638 --> 00:16:41.433
let's say the minimum, let's say 240.

276
00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:46.081
And we'll give it maximum height of,

277
00:16:46.081 --> 00:16:49.865
I don't know, 480 again.

278
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.025
Cool, so now I've got a component that
I can kinda use that has some kind of

279
00:16:57.025 --> 00:16:58.870
natural bounds to it.

280
00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:05.404
And we can argue that's maybe too short,
but you can adjust the numbers yourself.

281
00:17:05.404 --> 00:17:09.829
But effectively, now we've got a card that
really does look and feel like something

282
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:14.024
we'd seen in responsive design that we
implemented in code, but all in Figma.

283
00:17:14.024 --> 00:17:19.649
And also it can bring this in
to the one where I've got,

284
00:17:19.649 --> 00:17:22.470
it's inside the pay team.

285
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:28.168
I gotta switch this one over in a second,
but just in the sake of keeping it simple.

286
00:17:28.168 --> 00:17:31.230
I can kinda go through and
see each piece, and

287
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:34.380
this is in dev mode,
tou can kinda get a sense.

288
00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:39.825
If I click on each one of these, it gives
you a lot of the answers around, this

289
00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:45.208
is spaced between in the Flexbox and it
kinda shows you the pieces super easily.

290
00:17:45.208 --> 00:17:49.663
That said, one would argue that,
I think with some of the stuff,

291
00:17:49.663 --> 00:17:54.769
once we conceptually understand
the relationship between auto layout and

292
00:17:54.769 --> 00:18:00.294
Flexbox, you could probably also stare at
the thing and get a sense of it as well.

293
00:18:00.294 --> 00:18:05.017
And that becomes easier when either
you playing the role of designer or

294
00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:10.475
in collaboration with the design team
kinda get some of these patterns in place.

295
00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:15.321
It becomes a lot easier to get
designs where the implementation is

296
00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:20.266
more obvious than if they were
just strategically placed as well.
