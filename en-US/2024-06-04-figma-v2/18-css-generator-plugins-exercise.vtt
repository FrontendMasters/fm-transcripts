00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.366
There are a bunch of other useful
plugins that, once you have,

2
00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:07.442
let's say, the textiles in place,
there are a bunch of interesting ones.

3
00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:12.615
And, like, honestly,
I don't have a favorite, per se,

4
00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:17.380
because it really depends on
the output that you need.

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.625
One that I used to use a lot,
is this CSS gen?

6
00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:26.693
And what's cool about this one
is you can have CSS variables or

7
00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:30.310
if you use Sass or less,
you can do that too.

8
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.751
And you can say, if you want hex values,
I don't have any color.

9
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:38.357
I might have a color in there or
something like that, but colors,

10
00:00:38.357 --> 00:00:40.334
you can choose what modes you want.

11
00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.924
Cool, cool, cool, root font size so for

12
00:00:42.924 --> 00:00:45.891
the sort of RAM question I got earlier,
right?

13
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.507
It will produce RAM add prefix or
not, let's sit no.

14
00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:52.419
Use RAM font size.

15
00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:54.437
We don't need to add a style description.

16
00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:58.337
And then hold on my screen is now
more zoomed in than it was, but

17
00:00:58.337 --> 00:00:59.465
we can kinda see.

18
00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:04.030
We'll generate, and
this one will actually generate a whole

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.469
bunch of CSS classes that you can use,
right?

20
00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:12.066
And so you could theoretically
drop this into your like,

21
00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:16.759
literally CSS file and
now have all of the typography using

22
00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.671
your designs available as CSS
classes that you can just use.

23
00:01:21.671 --> 00:01:27.094
So now what's really powerful about this
is if I click on any of these fonts,

24
00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:31.184
I can see that it is text-9L
typography light, right?

25
00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:36.651
And I know just through looking
at it that there is a CSS class.

26
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:39.638
Now I'm not sitting there going, okay, so

27
00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:43.047
it's like a size 96 font and
this line spacing.

28
00:01:43.047 --> 00:01:44.464
It generated all of that.

29
00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:49.229
I use the class, I move on with my life, I
can go back to looking at guitars, right?

30
00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.026
I ship the ticket a lot faster.

31
00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:57.569
There is another one that I really like.

32
00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.752
There's variables to CSS and
then there's also, there's a one similar

33
00:02:02.752 --> 00:02:07.778
that will like make it to CSS variables
instead of CSS classes, right?

34
00:02:07.778 --> 00:02:11.206
Like whatever your code base best,
but like generally speaking,

35
00:02:11.206 --> 00:02:15.364
once you have an organized set of styles
and or variables when we get to them, like

36
00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:19.549
there are ways to then take all the hard
work of manually translating all of that.

37
00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.917
And auto-generate at least
the foundational components of how you

38
00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.838
implement it in CSS, right?

39
00:02:25.838 --> 00:02:30.331
So predominantly, because we can
also do colors with variables, and

40
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:35.523
you'll see why you might want to do
colors with variables later, it's tricky.

41
00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:41.050
But let's just see how you can
also do it in styles as well.

42
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.483
If I look at these,
they're kind of nicely,

43
00:02:43.483 --> 00:02:46.631
I grabbed this from something
that generated variables.

44
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:52.568
You can see that the name
of this layer is 50, right?

45
00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:54.672
That's not necessarily what I want.

46
00:02:54.672 --> 00:02:57.226
I'd love it to be called primary 50,
right?

47
00:02:57.226 --> 00:02:58.933
So how do I deal with this?

48
00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:01.029
I bulk-rename them.

49
00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:03.076
So your job just real quick go in here and

50
00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:07.561
grab you don't have to do all of them grab
whatever color makes you happiest, right?

51
00:03:07.561 --> 00:03:11.144
Run the batch rename, run styler, right?

52
00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:14.700
Generate at least the styles for
the colors and get a sense of that, and

53
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.089
then we'll meet back up, and
I'll kind of go through it with you.

54
00:03:23.093 --> 00:03:26.009
All right, so our mission but
there's a little,

55
00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:30.247
little nuance to it since trying to
undo a completed one, one edge case,

56
00:03:30.247 --> 00:03:35.038
which is these technically aren't layers
since I was gonna get angry with me which

57
00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:38.813
I figured out by just eavesdropping
on y'all during the break.

58
00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:42.029
So, yeah, I think, like,
when I go back and edit this,

59
00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:46.523
I'll make these into actual layers trying
to take an existing color palette and

60
00:03:46.523 --> 00:03:49.562
on color palette,
I had one edge case of in consider.

61
00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:54.947
But theoretically, let's pretend we lived
in a happy place where that worked.

62
00:03:54.947 --> 00:03:58.140
You could bulk rename them all and
run Styler.

63
00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.275
Just like we did for the fonts.

64
00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:03.504
That said, I'm not willing to invest more
time in this because I don't want color

65
00:04:03.504 --> 00:04:05.300
styles, I want color variables.

66
00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.771
So like spending time doing that,
it's not interesting to me.

67
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:10.518
Cool.

68
00:04:10.518 --> 00:04:13.899
One thing I wanna talk about is this
works for an existing type system.

69
00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:16.512
This works for
existing color palette, right?

70
00:04:16.512 --> 00:04:21.216
However, I made this colorful palette,
and you can too, and

71
00:04:21.216 --> 00:04:27.477
you can make your own type system, right,
using something called math, right?

72
00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:31.004
Now I'm a liberal arts major, so
I will not be doing the math.

73
00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:34.048
I will be employing
computers to do math for me.

74
00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:39.509
So let's go ahead and try out,
but for the typefaces,

75
00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:45.229
one that I like is called typescales,
and you can run it.

76
00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.281
And you can deal with the fact that

77
00:04:48.281 --> 00:04:52.430
my screen is a lot smaller
than it was before.

78
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.856
Actually, I can see all
the parts that are important.

79
00:04:56.856 --> 00:04:59.219
There's a few more fonts down here, but

80
00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.777
my increased resolution is
hurting our feelings right now.

81
00:05:02.777 --> 00:05:06.162
But what's cool about it,
you can set the base size for the RAM.

82
00:05:06.162 --> 00:05:07.894
16 is like standard, so

83
00:05:07.894 --> 00:05:11.927
we'll keep that you can choose
the way that the fonts scale.

84
00:05:11.927 --> 00:05:15.234
There seems to be some kind of
music reference going on here.

85
00:05:15.234 --> 00:05:20.615
You pick major third, you can pick a minor
third, golden ratio that makes you happy.

86
00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:23.092
You can also see how
all this stuff matters.

87
00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:28.260
You can pick the line height, how many
sizes above the base you want, and

88
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.767
how many below that you want, and whether
or not you want to round the values or

89
00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:39.064
not, I don't ever want to live in
a world with a 61.488 pixel font.

90
00:05:39.064 --> 00:05:45.829
So I'm gonna choose around the values,
and we hit generate,

91
00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:52.606
and it creates a frame with all
of those font sizes ready to go.

92
00:05:52.606 --> 00:05:58.681
And for the trick that I
wanted to show you before,

93
00:05:58.681 --> 00:06:02.885
we can grab each of these, right?

94
00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:05.703
If you hold command that trick
we saw in the beginning,

95
00:06:05.703 --> 00:06:10.008
as long as you don't get like this is,
I'll add another frame hiding under there.

96
00:06:10.008 --> 00:06:15.326
Get rid of that,
if I hold command, I can create,

97
00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:19.139
grab just the nested ones, right?

98
00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.306
And like, so now I've got each one
of those and like, theoretically,

99
00:06:23.306 --> 00:06:27.820
if I ran Styler, I would get a bunch
of styles called type at 9, type at 12,

100
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.950
type at whatever.

101
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.561
If I wanted to bulk rename these things,
that's where I can hit command r.

102
00:06:32.561 --> 00:06:40.643
And I could say, instead of type at,
We can say like whatever,

103
00:06:40.643 --> 00:06:44.841
and like you can rename
the numbers if you want to, but

104
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:48.200
you can rename these to whatever you want,

105
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.420
and then you could theoretically
run Styler on them.

106
00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:58.971
Right?

107
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:01.971
Created nine new typefaces.

108
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:04.401
There's one for bulk replacing fonts.

109
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.614
This will do it in, I believe,
enters the default one,

110
00:07:08.614 --> 00:07:14.099
now they're in style, so if you need
to adjust it, yeah, it's Enter.

111
00:07:14.099 --> 00:07:16.709
You can also replace the font,
stuff along those lines, right?

112
00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:19.120
Like, ideally, as an engineer,
like the design team,

113
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.597
probably has come up with some
kind of typography system.

114
00:07:21.597 --> 00:07:25.554
But if you find yourself at
a startup playing designer,

115
00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:30.687
because you are the only front end
engineer, I was like three years ago,

116
00:07:30.687 --> 00:07:35.933
this is good, because have I read a book
on type systems and color theory?

117
00:07:35.933 --> 00:07:38.032
Yes.
Do I really trust myself?

118
00:07:38.032 --> 00:07:38.906
I don't.

119
00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:43.142
And so this will go ahead and kind of
get you some of the basics as well,

120
00:07:43.142 --> 00:07:47.983
and then you can use some of these tools
to bulk create the styles that you want.

121
00:07:47.983 --> 00:07:50.593
You might have to do some
little manual renaming, but

122
00:07:50.593 --> 00:07:52.856
the overall time investment
is not that much,

123
00:07:52.856 --> 00:07:56.059
particularly if you don't have
a bunch of people staring at you.

124
00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:58.725
You kind of just do it
during something else.

125
00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:01.947
It's a little bit of clicking,
but you can kind of like,

126
00:08:01.947 --> 00:08:03.973
get through it all pretty quickly.

127
00:08:03.973 --> 00:08:07.802
There's still a piece of me that
wants to slay this beast, but

128
00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:09.579
I'm not going to right now.

129
00:08:09.579 --> 00:08:12.971
All these seem like bad ideas, okay?

130
00:08:12.971 --> 00:08:16.423
But the same basic approach works for
any styles that we wanna create in bulk.

131
00:08:16.423 --> 00:08:19.316
The other thing we can do is
to create a color system.

132
00:08:19.316 --> 00:08:23.191
There are a lot of different tools for
this.

133
00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:28.031
The one that I like is again,

134
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:33.694
I happen to use Tailwind at work.

135
00:08:33.694 --> 00:08:35.310
None of this is Tailwind specific.

136
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.232
I mean, that one is definitely Tailwind
specific, but this one is not.

137
00:08:38.232 --> 00:08:43.856
This comes from a website
called uicolors.app, right?

138
00:08:43.856 --> 00:08:47.369
Which you can also go visit, but

139
00:08:47.369 --> 00:08:53.368
what this does is it allows
you to pick a color, right?

140
00:08:53.368 --> 00:08:56.775
And then it creates all
the various shades for you, and

141
00:08:56.775 --> 00:09:00.851
what's even nicer is it can generate
a color guide like these ones

142
00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:03.762
that I tried to reverse engineer and
failure.

143
00:09:03.762 --> 00:09:08.056
And it will also create
either the styles or

144
00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:12.001
the variables for you as well, right?

145
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:17.068
And so you can define that base color,
tweak it however you want and

146
00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:20.523
then like have it say, hey, create styles.

147
00:09:20.523 --> 00:09:22.612
It will give it a default name.

148
00:09:22.612 --> 00:09:27.132
In this case, there is, I've used
multiple, like color palette apps, and

149
00:09:27.132 --> 00:09:29.926
they all will give the same
color the same name.

150
00:09:29.926 --> 00:09:33.004
So there's clearly some JavaScript
library that everyone uses.

151
00:09:33.004 --> 00:09:37.772
But we're gonna talk a little bit
about color names versus semantic

152
00:09:37.772 --> 00:09:39.862
names in a little bit right but

153
00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:45.316
like one would argue in no world do you
really want this called fountain blue?

154
00:09:45.316 --> 00:09:52.692
You either want to call it like primary
brand, information danger error, or blue.

155
00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:57.044
Fountain blue seems oddly specific
unless you have 17 other blues,

156
00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:00.594
so we can call this blue, and
we say, create the styles.

157
00:10:00.594 --> 00:10:04.127
And you can see that it
generated a color palette,

158
00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:09.272
much like the one that I accidentally
tried to have as reverse engineer.

159
00:10:09.272 --> 00:10:12.459
And then if we go into the color styles,

160
00:10:12.459 --> 00:10:17.385
you can see that I created all of
these blues that we can now use

161
00:10:17.385 --> 00:10:22.226
without ever having to think
about the hex code ever again.

162
00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:26.325
And again it also helps making sure that
we have consistency across the designs

163
00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:29.181
because it is a lot easier to
accidentally just drag and

164
00:10:29.181 --> 00:10:32.657
drop that little like color wheel in
a design than it is to look up yet

165
00:10:32.657 --> 00:10:35.853
another hex code, right and
implement that stuff, right?

166
00:10:35.853 --> 00:10:37.858
Like, it's not that big a deal
when you're working on design.

167
00:10:37.858 --> 00:10:39.516
It's a bit big deal when
you're implementing it.

168
00:10:39.516 --> 00:10:42.022
So this will create all that for
you as well.

169
00:10:42.022 --> 00:10:47.148
If you need to get rid of these you
can also just scroll up, hit Shift.

170
00:10:50.603 --> 00:10:51.442
No.

171
00:10:54.437 --> 00:10:57.894
Maybe not that I don't think and go across
the boundaries of the different sections.

172
00:10:57.894 --> 00:11:04.147
Hit Shift and delete lots of things.

173
00:11:04.147 --> 00:11:05.396
I do entire sections.

174
00:11:05.396 --> 00:11:07.228
Yeah I can, right?

175
00:11:07.228 --> 00:11:09.438
And so you can go ahead and
delete them if you don't want them.

176
00:11:09.438 --> 00:11:12.969
Now styler will like also like, again we
saw before, you rename a thing, and it can

177
00:11:12.969 --> 00:11:16.617
handle renaming so you don't have to leave
stuff if you're just trying to rename it.

178
00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:22.663
But we don't want all these styles right
now, because they were just us playing

179
00:11:22.663 --> 00:11:26.565
around, but I want to delete all of them
in front of you because that's boring.

180
00:11:26.565 --> 00:11:32.507
So styles, I would say at this
point at the time of recording,

181
00:11:32.507 --> 00:11:39.387
I mostly only use styles for
layout grids, shadows, and typography.

182
00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:43.263
When variables come to typography,
I will probably use variables fat for

183
00:11:43.263 --> 00:11:45.340
reasons I will show you in a little bit.

184
00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:50.303
There are things that variables don't
support, even though they support colors.

185
00:11:50.303 --> 00:11:53.699
For instance, linear gradients,
styles only, right?

186
00:11:53.699 --> 00:11:56.615
And so there's a time and
a place to still use styles.

187
00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:59.628
And if you're like, I don't really
understand when I'm supposed to see

188
00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:02.070
a style and when I'm supposed
to see a variable, welcome.

189
00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:03.933
It's like a weird, like,

190
00:12:03.933 --> 00:12:09.129
transitionary period at the time of
this recording, that is a valid thing.

191
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:16.566
If you have a bunch of styles, right, one
could run the styles to variables plugin.

192
00:12:16.566 --> 00:12:20.327
Why you might use this even if you don't
have a bunch of styles is it a lot of

193
00:12:20.327 --> 00:12:24.339
cases there is more tooling for generating
a bunch of styles than there are for

194
00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:26.149
generating a bunch of variables.

195
00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:30.415
So sometimes it makes sense to
generate a bunch of styles and

196
00:12:30.415 --> 00:12:32.985
then create variables off of that.

197
00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:37.027
There are plugins where you can
theoretically throw in a picture, and

198
00:12:37.027 --> 00:12:40.052
it will generate a color
palette from that picture.

199
00:12:40.052 --> 00:12:43.131
That seems cute, it's really useful.

200
00:12:43.131 --> 00:12:49.043
You throw in like a screenshot of your
current UI, and you have a generated color

201
00:12:49.043 --> 00:12:54.337
palette based off the current UI,
which is a lot better than what I did,

202
00:12:54.337 --> 00:13:00.363
which is sit there with a color picker for
30 minutes and select them one by one.

203
00:13:00.363 --> 00:13:02.238
So that's another way to do it.

204
00:13:02.238 --> 00:13:05.057
Depending on what situation you're in,

205
00:13:05.057 --> 00:13:10.054
there is usually a tool that exists
that makes your life somewhat easier.
