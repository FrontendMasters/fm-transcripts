00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.570
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's use it,
we have an array of weapons.

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.810
We have a candlestick,
a lead pipe and a revolver.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.830
We also have this function
called makeBroken.

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.110
What it does is it takes and

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.710
item returns a broken item by
prepending it with the word broken.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.300
So, what we want to do is

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.590
we want an array of broken weapons.

8
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.980
We're pacifists here, okay?

9
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.350
We make functions that break them.

10
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.426
How might we do that?

11
00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:48.626
Let's take five minutes to do that.

12
00:00:48.626 --> 00:00:55.750
One tip is that,
I don't think there's underscore here.

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.665
There's kombuches here,
do you guys see this?

14
00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:03.000
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What is that?

15
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.109
Does anyone know what that is?

16
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.014
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That is funny.

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.500
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hm.

18
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.320
Something's tracking me.

19
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.880
Okay.

20
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.100
So, looks like we don't have a underscore,
we have some other things.

21
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.810
So, if you want to use _map, what I do,
and I also do this with jQuery

22
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.190
if I wanna just test something really
quick, is I just go the _js website.

23
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.160
We don't wanna go to the docs, cuz then
you can see it, and you just open it,

24
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.506
and it'll have it.

25
00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:48.870
So, that's a tip.

26
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.100
You can just come here if you
don't wanna sit at the library and

27
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.010
all that, if you don't already
have it you can do that.

28
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.794
And most libraries will let you do this.

29
00:01:56.794 --> 00:02:00.500
So jQuery,

30
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.579
you can see,

31
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.178
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know anyway,

32
00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:13.990
it's there.

33
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.000
&gt;&gt; Off screen: What are you looking for?

34
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.900
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nothing, I was
just showing them that they can access

35
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.770
the jQuery library.

36
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.140
By just going to the jQuery website and
playing in the console.

37
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.020
Just as like a quick and dirty, I wanna
see something, really how it works.

38
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.030
Okay, So, you guys got your task.

39
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.550
We're gonna take these weapons.

40
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.370
We're gonna make them broken
by mapping over them.
