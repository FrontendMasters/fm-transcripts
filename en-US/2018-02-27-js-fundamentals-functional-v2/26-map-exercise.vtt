00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.240
Let's use it.

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:07.850
We have a array of weapons, we have a
candlestick, a lead pipe, and a revolver.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.870
We also have this function
called makeBroken.

4
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.522
What it does is it takes an item and

5
00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:19.710
it returns a broken item by prepending
it with the word [LAUGH] broken.

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.536
So, what we wanna do is we want a,

7
00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:33.590
Array, we want an array of broken weapons.

8
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.980
We're pacifists here, okay?

9
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.591
We make functions that break them.

10
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.616
And, how might we do that?

11
00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:49.235
Let's take 5 minutes, To do that.

12
00:00:49.235 --> 00:00:55.750
One tip is that I don't think
there's underscore here.

13
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.280
There's kombuchas here,
do you guys see this?

14
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.620
What is that?

15
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.972
Does anyone know what that is?

16
00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:12.280
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; That is funny.

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:20.320
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Something's tracking me.

18
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.580
Okay, so
looks like we don't have underscore.

19
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.100
We have some other things.

20
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.557
So if you want to use underscore map, what
I do and I also do this with jQuery, if I

21
00:01:33.557 --> 00:01:39.190
want to just test something really quick,
I just go to the underscore js website.

22
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.470
We don't wanna go to the docs
cuz then you can see it.

23
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.770
And you just open it, and it will have it.

24
00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.925
So that's a tip, you can just come here if
you don't wanna like set up a library and

25
00:01:51.925 --> 00:01:54.805
all that, you don't already have it,
can do that and

26
00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.370
most libraries will let you do this.

27
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.133
So you guys got your task,
we're gonna take these weapons,

28
00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:02.530
we're gonna make them broken
by mapping over them.
