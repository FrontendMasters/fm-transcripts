00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.879
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
so what do we do here?

2
00:00:04.384 --> 00:00:10.944
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Increment = (n).

3
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:18.978
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Actually
we could do this

4
00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:24.231
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: n + 1.

5
00:00:26.874 --> 00:00:32.802
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: n,

6
00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:37.981
so, in this case,
because we're saying n times n and

7
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:44.210
n + n, we don't need It to
explicitly return or have brackets.

8
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.057
However, I recommend for your sanity,

9
00:00:47.057 --> 00:00:50.920
cuz there's a lot of edge cases,
just to always do it.

10
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.571
Just make your life better.

11
00:00:59.628 --> 00:01:03.853
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And so
we have doMathSoIDontHaveTo.

12
00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:12.824
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And that equals that,
and we need to have n, func.

13
00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:14.740
Yeah, also we don't need these.

14
00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:29.554
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
then we return func(n).

15
00:01:32.862 --> 00:01:35.131
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

16
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:40.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Thank you.

17
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.251
Okay.

18
00:01:44.564 --> 00:01:45.285
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: There we go.

19
00:01:47.871 --> 00:01:49.029
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Any questions?

20
00:01:51.628 --> 00:01:56.189
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's
a nice break from scope.

21
00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.250
A scope brain, mush.
