00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So this is JavaScript
fundamentals to functional programming.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.830
We're gonna learn
the fundamentals of JavaScript by

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.610
applying them to functional
utility methods.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:18.280
So it's gonna be a fun class and
I probably should introduce myself first.

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.100
So my name's Bianca, I'm an open-source
JavaScript framework developer,

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.200
consultant, and a trainer.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.680
I work at Bitovi,
which is based in Chicago.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.040
We are a JavaScript consulting firm that
builds our own open-source framework.

9
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.839
DoneJS, CanJS, any kind of JavaScript
tool that you can think of,

10
00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.390
we have a like Webpack kind of tool.

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.430
We have a documentation generator.

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.100
We have a testing framework.

13
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.060
So we do it all and it's really cool.

14
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.420
I've been learning a lot working there.

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.380
I've been there for about six months now.

16
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.770
Kind of diving into morale of
the meta programming side of things,

17
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.800
which has been very interesting.

18
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.800
You can follow me on Twitter,
@BiancaGando,

19
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.900
it makes me feel popular if you do that.

20
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.420
And about me, aside from JavaScript stuff,
I like really bad puns.

21
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.220
So if you think of one, let me know.

22
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:22.260
I also really like board games, riddles
and mysteries, and stuff like that.

23
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.660
So that's me.

24
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.300
So I just wanna start off to be
clear that this course is not

25
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.400
really about functional programming.

26
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.150
There are courses out there
about functional programming.

27
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.720
This course is about
JavaScript fundamentals.

28
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.060
And we use functional programming because
I believe that the core concepts that it

29
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.620
takes the understand and
use functional programming methods.

30
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.660
Will just help you become deeper
with the JavaScript language.

31
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.740
So the main things that we're
gonna cover are objects, arrays,

32
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.670
functions and high order functions,
scope closures, things like that.

33
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.700
And we are going to practice those
by using functional utility methods.

34
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.620
And if you have no idea what that is yet,

35
00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.770
you'll learn all about them,
and also implementing them.

36
00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.750
So not only will we be using them but
we'll be implementing them.

37
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.370
So then when you move onto
your future courses or

38
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.540
maybe you're picking up rxts or
something like that.

39
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.040
You will understand like how this
stuff works under the hood and

40
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.540
it will make you just a better
developer in general.

41
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.620
You'll be able to understand
how this stuff works.

42
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.060
You don't just trust in the magic,

43
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.510
you understand the magic cuz you
implemented it yourself, cool.

44
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.330
Awesome, anyone surprised
by this statement?

45
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.300
No?
We're good?

46
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.660
Okay, good.
Sometimes people

47
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.870
come in with the wrong idea, awesome.

48
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.300
But this is probably surprising,

49
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.980
because this course is also about
figuring out what happened to Mr. Body.

50
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.440
Mr. Body is a millionaire tycoon who
knows all the secrets of his friends.

51
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.110
He threatened to exploit these secrets,
and was murdered.

52
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.420
So through this course,
we'll figure out who killed Mr. Body.

53
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.160
So now you can see why I like
board games and mysteries.

54
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.550
And all of this, it gets a little
complicated because we'll also be

55
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.600
doing some JavaScript, maybe a little bit.

56
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.340
But mostly we're gonna be
figuring out this murder mystery.

57
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.740
So just a review,

58
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.280
you're gonna strengthen your
understanding of tricky jobs concepts.

59
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.280
We're gonna be learning about
functional utility methods.

60
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.940
What are those?

61
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.110
Have you ever heard of like, each,
it's not super functional, but

62
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.640
it's kinda the stepping stone map reduce,
concat, things like that.

63
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.620
Those are what I talk

64
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.490
when I say functional utility
methods that's what I mean.

65
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.030
We're gonna understand
how to implement them,

66
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.070
and we're gonna apply our
JavaScript fundamentals throughout.

67
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.930
Learn some ES6 features.

68
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.070
When I originally thought about
this course, I thought I would just

69
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.440
rewrite everything in ES6, and
that would be the upgraded version.

70
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.350
But then I realized that, in doing that,
we would lose a lot of the key concepts.

71
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.930
A lot of ES6 is syntactically sugar.

72
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.780
And to really master JavaScript you have
to understand what it's really doing.

73
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.570
So we're gonna be focusing on ES5, and
then adding ES6, if that makes sense.

74
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.630
So it's not that this whole course
is gonna be totally in ES6.

75
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.820
It's not gonna be arrow functions,
constant let everywhere.

76
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.960
But we will be going into how some ES6
features effect things like objects,

77
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.910
arrays, functions, and Things like that.

78
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.800
Cool?

79
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.180
And we'll also figure out,
the murder mystery.

80
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.720
That's the bonus.

81
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.080
So a little more about expectations.

82
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.210
I expect everyone here to be sincere,
but not serious.

83
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.860
I want to have fun.

84
00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.250
This is an interactive course.

85
00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.640
My style is very socratic.

86
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.640
So expect for me to call on you.

87
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.170
You may have warning ahead of time,
you may not.

88
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.780
So just know that now, maybe take a deep
breath while you're digesting that.

89
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.010
And this is important for
all of us, right?

90
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.380
It's not about embarrassing you,

91
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.590
it's about getting a pulse of
where we're all at, right?

92
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.278
So we're here together,
we're learning together as a team.

93
00:05:21.278 --> 00:05:25.830
And I wanna make sure that we're all
getting to the same place, right?

94
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.836
And if someone's left behind,
that means that probably I messed up and

95
00:05:29.836 --> 00:05:31.690
I missed something.

96
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.530
So, that's a part of it.

97
00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.840
But you do have a way out.

98
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.150
I used to not, but
I've gotten nicer in my old age.

99
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.840
So either I'll ask you a question.

100
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.290
Sometimes I'll warn you,
sometimes I won't.

101
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.370
But you have to be prepared either to
answer it, or to ask me a question.

102
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.370
So if you're terrified of me
calling on you, just make sure

103
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.990
that you note a question around every
few slides, and then you'll be fine.
