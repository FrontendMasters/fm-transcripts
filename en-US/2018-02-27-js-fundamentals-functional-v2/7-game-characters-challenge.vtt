00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.656
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So this is
a creative exercise where we're going to

2
00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:09.761
create a clue game and
represent it as an object in array.

3
00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:14.572
So let me tell you a little bit
about what is in a Clue game, so

4
00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:18.638
that you can effectively
approach this problem.

5
00:00:18.638 --> 00:00:21.633
So there are a few things.

6
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:25.486
And you don't need to do all of these, but
I'm just gonna give you sort of a rundown,

7
00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:28.350
and you can choose whatever
you think is important.

8
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.490
It's more of a creative exercise.

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.420
And there's no one right way to do it.

10
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.100
So, obviously it's a board game, right.

11
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.830
So you have pieces and
a board, and stuff like that.

12
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.210
So if you really wanna represent
the visual aspect of the Clue game.

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.960
You can think about the different
pieces that there are.

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.020
So there's pieces for the characters.

15
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.570
There are different cards for the two,

16
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.530
so there's different characters.

17
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.780
There are weapons and
there are rooms in this game.

18
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.470
And there is a card that looks
like this is called confidential.

19
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.300
Inside of this card
there are three things,

20
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.780
there's the murderer, there's the room,
and there's the weapon.

21
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.730
And so, no one see it until the very end.

22
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.800
The whole process of the game is to
figure out which cards are in this

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.930
envelope because everyone
else has all the other cards.

24
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.040
So you need to figure out who the other
cards, to figure out which cards

25
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.071
are missing to make a good guess as
to what is inside of this envelope.

26
00:01:40.765 --> 00:01:43.500
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
the data is characters, right?

27
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.120
And you can make up
character names if you want.

28
00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.770
They usually correspond with different
colors, weapons, keep it, I don't know.

29
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.577
Actually do whatever you want.

30
00:01:57.577 --> 00:01:59.480
And then rooms.

31
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.280
And this is kind of a old school game,

32
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.205
so the rooms are like the parlor and
the billiard.

33
00:02:07.205 --> 00:02:07.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The conservatory.

34
00:02:07.718 --> 00:02:10.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
the conservatory, and the library.

35
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.710
And the weapons are like
the candlestick or a lead pipe.

36
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.360
Stuff like that.

37
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.540
So, that's your task.
