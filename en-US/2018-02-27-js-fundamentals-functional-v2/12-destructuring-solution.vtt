1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.060
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
let's go through it.

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.140
And then after that, we'll talk about what
happened earlier when that error came up.

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.033
All right, so

4
00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:16.067
who is going to program this?

5
00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:20.201
How about,

6
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:25.506
yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We'll start off with

7
00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:31.240
const and then the object.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

8
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Open bracket it up equals.

9
00:00:37.045 --> 00:00:45.256
No, no, yeah, without the brackets.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: After object,

10
00:00:45.256 --> 00:00:51.507
we'll say equals, open bracket,
and then name, room, weapon,

11
00:00:51.507 --> 00:00:57.154
and assign the variables.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, all right,

12
00:00:57.154 --> 00:01:04.574
let's run it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Are we

13
00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:14.153
confident this is gonna work?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Ugh, really?

14
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:26.818
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you bump up that console

15
00:01:26.818 --> 00:01:32.844
size?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

16
00:01:32.844 --> 00:01:33.502
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Man, it's like

17
00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:37.283
a separate setting.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All

18
00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:37.911
right, you know what?

19
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:38.691
I'll just do it here.

20
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.437
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

21
00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:52.420
what do we think is gonna happen?

22
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.650
How about with the Diet Coke?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What

23
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.903
do we think is gonna happen?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

24
00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:04.271
just take a guess.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well,

25
00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:08.310
it looks like the object at the top,

26
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.684
does it have the name object?

27
00:02:11.684 --> 00:02:13.143
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It does,

28
00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:14.320
okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No.

29
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It doesn't.

30
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.320
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You're right.

31
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

32
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.759
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's just a anonymous

33
00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.864
object.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay, so then this

34
00:02:20.864 --> 00:02:25.624
should just, it-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's the problem?

35
00:02:25.624 --> 00:02:27.031
How could we fix it?

36
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.967
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well,

37
00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:33.584
if we were writing it with destructuring,

38
00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:39.356
we'd have const open bracket name, room,

39
00:02:39.356 --> 00:02:46.603
weapon equals.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay, name and weapon, okay.

40
00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:52.763
And then on right side,

41
00:02:52.763 --> 00:02:58.530
name: Rusty.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like this?

42
00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, pretty much.

43
00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:04.255
And then, yeah, looks like we're missing

44
00:03:04.255 --> 00:03:09.794
the room on the left side, but-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

45
00:03:09.794 --> 00:03:15.280
all right, cool.

46
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.120
What do we think?

47
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.370
Is it gonna run?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It will run.

48
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.831
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is it gonna give us

49
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:26.050
what we expect?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well, so after you ran that,

50
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.740
then you could just call name and it would
give you Rusty, I think, for example.

51
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.650
I don't know if

52
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.270
that answers your question, but that's me.

53
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.400
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

54
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.020
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Do a snap or

55
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.400
something?

56
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.332
Woo!
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome,

57
00:03:43.332 --> 00:03:47.493
so do you guys use destructuring
in your day to day?

58
00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:51.208
Do you guys use ES6 in
your work a little bit?

59
00:03:51.208 --> 00:03:55.821
So I use ES6, I don't use it,
I sometimes use it?

60
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:58.178
Okay, most of us don't.

61
00:03:58.178 --> 00:04:02.529
Cool, all right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I have a question.

62
00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:03.400
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

63
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.496
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So we have tackled a little

64
00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:06.836
bit about this.

65
00:04:06.836 --> 00:04:12.329
We were both kinda thrown on how, so
when you're calling name right now,

66
00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.355
I guess it's like an anonymous object.

67
00:04:15.355 --> 00:04:17.481
It doesn't have an explicit name.

68
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:21.712
So when we call the variable name,
is it calling it a global object or

69
00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:24.309
something, is that making sense?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

70
00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:29.830
it's basically saying var name =.

71
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.725
Well, let's name our object really quick,

72
00:04:33.725 --> 00:04:38.906
let's just name this object,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right?

73
00:04:38.906 --> 00:04:44.706
So it's the equivalent of saying var name,
or const name actually,

74
00:04:44.706 --> 00:04:48.940
but I don't wanna go back, is obj.name.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Okay.

75
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.024
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So you're declaring

76
00:04:50.024 --> 00:04:50.689
a variable.

77
00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:59.113
Yeah, and you're doing that three times.

78
00:04:59.113 --> 00:05:06.580
So this is saving you three lines of code,
yeah, about three to do it this way.
