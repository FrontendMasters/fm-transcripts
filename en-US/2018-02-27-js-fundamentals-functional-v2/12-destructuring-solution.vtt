00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:02.795
So what do we think is gonna happen?

2
00:00:05.192 --> 00:00:11.950
How about with the Diet Coke?

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.400
&gt;&gt; What do we think is gonna happen?

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.133
&gt;&gt; Well,
it looks like the object at the top,

5
00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:25.720
does it have the name object It does okay.

6
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.281
&gt;&gt; No, it doesn't,
it's just an anonymus object.

7
00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:32.721
&gt;&gt; Okay, so then this should,

8
00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:36.211
Just [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] How can we fix it?

9
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:41.194
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] [LAUGH] Well,
if we were writting it

10
00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:45.738
with destructuing we have, const,

11
00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:51.467
open bracket, name, room, weapon equals.

12
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.108
Okay, name and weapon, okay, and

13
00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:05.242
then the name on the right side name,
call in rusty.

14
00:01:07.705 --> 00:01:12.467
&gt;&gt; Like this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, pretty much, And

15
00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:17.627
then yeah, looks over missing the room
in the first on the left side but.

16
00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:18.406
&gt;&gt; Okay.

17
00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:23.653
&gt;&gt; [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right, cool.

18
00:01:25.565 --> 00:01:27.900
What do we think, is it gonna run?

19
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.722
&gt;&gt; It will run.

20
00:01:29.722 --> 00:01:34.032
&gt;&gt; Is it gonna give us what we expect?

21
00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:38.675
&gt;&gt; Well, so I mean, after you ran that,
then you could just call name and

22
00:01:38.675 --> 00:01:41.930
it would give you Rusty,
I think, for example.

23
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.209
I don't know if that answers
your question, but that's me.

24
00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:46.691
&gt;&gt; Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

25
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:50.453
&gt;&gt; Do snap or something [SOUND]

26
00:01:52.943 --> 00:01:58.583
Awesome, so do you guys use
destructuring in your day to day life,

27
00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:01.416
do you guys use ES6 in your work?

28
00:02:01.416 --> 00:02:07.811
A little bit, so I use ES6 I don't use it,
I sometimes use it,

29
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:12.417
okay, most of the stuff, cool, all right?

30
00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:13.742
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

31
00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:15.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

32
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.389
&gt;&gt; So, we talked a little bit about this,
you're both kind of thrown on how, so

33
00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:26.090
like when you're calling name right now,
I guess it's like an anonymous object.

34
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.477
It doesn't have like an explicit name,
so when we call the variable name is it

35
00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:34.396
calling on like a global object or
something, does that make sense?

36
00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:39.974
&gt;&gt; So it's actually create,
it's basically saying var name equals,

37
00:02:39.974 --> 00:02:46.143
well, let's name our object really quick,
let's just name this object.

38
00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:49.199
&gt;&gt; [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Right, so

39
00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.804
it's the equivalent of saying var name or

40
00:02:52.804 --> 00:02:58.168
const name actually, but,
I wanna go back this object name.

41
00:02:58.168 --> 00:02:59.049
&gt;&gt; Okay.

42
00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:08.450
&gt;&gt; So, you're declaring a variable Yeah.

43
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.948
And you're doing that three times, so
this is saving you three lines of code,

44
00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:16.960
maybe yeah, about three to do it this way.
