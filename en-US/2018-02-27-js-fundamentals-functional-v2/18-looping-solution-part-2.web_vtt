WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.300
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, the exercise was
to loop through all the properties of

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.040
the suspect objects in the suspects array,
and mark them if you think you're guilty.

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.190
I'm curious to see how
you guys approached it.

4
00:00:16.074 --> 00:00:17.580
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we still have this game here.

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.250
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Do you wanna?

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.780
Take a step.

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.936
Did you finish it?

8
00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:28.581
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mostly,
I used for each method on here.

9
00:00:28.581 --> 00:00:31.120
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You used for each?

10
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.940
Did anyone use a loop?

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.342
Cool.
You used loop?

12
00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:36.744
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's a four
in like you're shown there.

13
00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:37.360
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

14
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.780
Cool.
We're gonna do for each next though.

15
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.280
You're ahead of the game all right,
so walk me through it.

16
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.004
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, sure, so I just
declared a function called game loop, so

17
00:00:48.004 --> 00:00:50.632
var game loop difficult function.

18
00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:51.132
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

19
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.351
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: First line of that is a for

20
00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:03.381
loop Ivar = 0
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I less than

21
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:08.670
games.suspects.length, i plus, plus.

22
00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:15.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: .length, you guys
have to be my spell check here, okay.

23
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I did the for
in loop, so I said for

24
00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:26.437
key in game.suspects i and then,

25
00:01:26.437 --> 00:01:32.130
first line of that is if statement.

26
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.770
I didn't really know exactly
how to figure out whose guilty.

27
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.960
You know I was thinking of getting like
a kind of confidential object, but

28
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.280
for now I thought rusty was it.

29
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.257
So I said if game.suspects at i and
then bracket key.

30
00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:53.910
Because I noticed you can't use .key here.

31
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:55.120
For whatever reason that didn't work.

32
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.410
Maybe you can explain,
but I had to do this.

33
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.341
So if that all equals,

34
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:05.199
equals, Rusty,
I just said Rusty in string.

35
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.860
Then I would have a log that
says found one or a return true,

36
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.030
maybe, just did a log there,
found him, yeah.

37
00:02:20.277 --> 00:02:23.215
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If I could type.

38
00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:26.337
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and

39
00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:29.698
then else not this time,
or something like that.

40
00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:37.273
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

41
00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:43.014
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So
since we have one of the things matching

42
00:02:43.014 --> 00:02:48.098
that should return one found them and

43
00:02:48.098 --> 00:02:50.896
the rest next time.

44
00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:52.450
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, I like it.

45
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.990
How many times does this outer loop run?

46
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.550
I feel like I pick on the people
on the outside the most.

47
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.448
I actually haven't talked
to our friend in the back.

48
00:03:06.448 --> 00:03:08.430
How many times does this loop run?

49
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It runs for each entry.

50
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.040
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For each what?

51
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Runs for
each entry in suspects.

52
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.290
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
each suspect object, right?

53
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.110
So a number form, two times, right?

54
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.870
Cool.

55
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.290
How many times does this loop run?

56
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Four.

57
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:41.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

58
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.359
And what order does it running?

59
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.730
So if I was going to console that log and
I'm gonna try to do this quick.

60
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:59.700
Outer loop, then we console that log,
inner loop.

61
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.710
What pattern would it log?

62
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.080
Someone in this area of the room.

63
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:19.701
I'm getting like decision
fatigue choosing people.

64
00:04:24.384 --> 00:04:27.183
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
what's the first thing that I will log?

65
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:31.872
How about Cameron?

66
00:04:31.872 --> 00:04:33.491
Sorry.

67
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.695
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Outer loop?

68
00:04:35.695 --> 00:04:37.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.

69
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.018
So it will log outer loop.

70
00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:45.620
And then, our lawyer friend.

71
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.198
what's the next thing that it'll log?

72
00:04:48.198 --> 00:04:52.183
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: In a loop.

73
00:04:52.183 --> 00:04:53.679
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

74
00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:56.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: And then another inner loop.

75
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.818
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: And
then two more inner loops.

76
00:04:59.818 --> 00:05:04.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not quite, so.

77
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.620
At this point our our first inner loop

78
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.140
suspect is gonna be our very first one,
right?

79
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.490
It's gonna be Rusty, orange.

80
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.380
So, for all the keys in this object,
it's gonna run it twice.

81
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.800
So, the first one is name, right?

82
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.120
Next one is caller, and then that's it.

83
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.570
So then we break out of this loop and
we continue back here.

84
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.821
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Assuming that we
didn't hit this if else statement,

85
00:05:37.821 --> 00:05:38.810
which we would have.

86
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.810
Does that make sense,
why it doesn't keep looping?

87
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Not really,
if you can go over it.

88
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure, one more time.

89
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.110
So do you know what this object is?

90
00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.326
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Yeah,
it is the first key in suspects.

91
00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:03.370
It's Rusty and orange.

92
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.010
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
it's going to loop through this object.

93
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.600
So there are two
properties to this object.

94
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.760
Right, the name, and
then there's a a color.

95
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.220
So it's gonna loop through both of those.

96
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.630
And that's all it knows about because,
i is 0.

97
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.320
And we've only made it that far so loop
doesn't like jump ahead it doesn't know

98
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.360
that in fact we are gonna ask it to
loop again for the next one but,

99
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.970
it won't know that until we
say game suspects at one.

100
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:40.530
See what I mean does that clarify?

101
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:41.860
Yeah, cool.

102
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.071
So we have outer loop, inner loop, inner
loop, and then this corner over here.

103
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:53.800
How about on the end,
what's the next thing that's gonna log?

104
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.371
Do you know?

105
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:58.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Outer loop?

106
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.410
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not quite
since suspects at i is rusty.

107
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.130
So what's the next thing?

108
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.758
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: If it's rusty
it's gonna be found on.

109
00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:17.184
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, awesome.

110
00:07:17.184 --> 00:07:18.938
And then what's the next
thing that's gonna run?

111
00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.780
Next door.

112
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:21.910
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right there, yeah.

113
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.920
What's the next log?

114
00:07:30.768 --> 00:07:31.684
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Me?

115
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: He's like not me,
please.

116
00:07:35.864 --> 00:07:40.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: You fulfill the logic
when you found Rusty, right?.

117
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: When you say we
fulfilled the logic, what does that mean?

118
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:48.452
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: It was equal to Rusty so
log you found so

119
00:07:48.452 --> 00:07:51.330
you resumed on the if.

120
00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:53.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then
if you iterate again.

121
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.919
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Then you gonna go through
that process and catch the else.

122
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well what's
the very next thing that happens?

123
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.030
After this.

124
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.380
So you're right that we met
a condition for a if statement,

125
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.340
we entered into an if block and
then we're gonna move on from that.

126
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: You're probably
gonna go back to the outer loop.

127
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:14.840
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

128
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: And repeat the operation.

129
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:18.298
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we'll console log outer loop next.

130
00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:22.979
&gt;&gt; [BLANK AUDIO]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

131
00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:25.370
then next
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Inner loop twice more.

132
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yup,
we'll do inner loop.

133
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:34.134
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Shouldn't found him
actually be before the first inner loop?

134
00:08:34.134 --> 00:08:35.629
Or matching the name?

135
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.660
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
you mean like this one should be later.

136
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.050
Well I think,
I mean there's no guarantees, but

137
00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:48.480
we'll just pretend that it's name.

138
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:48.980
Just for fun.

139
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:52.510
So then it's going to be inter looped.

140
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:53.060
What's that?

141
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's no guarantee
on the order of the properties?

142
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.084
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nah,
we'll just pretend.

143
00:08:57.084 --> 00:09:00.590
And then,
we're gonna enter into the if else.

144
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.310
What do you think it's going to log?

145
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.370
We're here.

146
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Why is it
running again through it?

147
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.450
Why didn't it stop after Rusty,
it did a console.log found 'em

148
00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.120
why would it go-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where did it

149
00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.691
tell it to stop?

150
00:09:17.691 --> 00:09:21.658
Cuz [INAUDIBLE] Mm-hm.

151
00:09:21.658 --> 00:09:23.320
How could you tell it to stop?

152
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.398
Do you know?

153
00:09:24.398 --> 00:09:25.336
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Break.

154
00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:27.400
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Break.

155
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.324
Yeah, you could break keep
you return stuff like that.

156
00:09:30.324 --> 00:09:33.024
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Would it log, so

157
00:09:33.024 --> 00:09:37.369
it's just gonna to do Rusty.

158
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well the color is orange.

159
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
it's gonna be the next property.

160
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.720
So then it will say next time.

161
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

162
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.770
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does that makes sense?

163
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's not Rusty.

164
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:50.560
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That has to be.

165
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.060
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

166
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:55.963
Cool.
Do you guys see where this is going and

167
00:09:55.963 --> 00:09:57.580
how this flows?

168
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.380
Okay, cool,
I think we should take a break.

169
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.960
It's been an hour.

170
00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can we run it once
just to see if we're right?

171
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:06.720
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

172
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:17.398
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We need this.

173
00:10:19.136 --> 00:10:24.453
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just
because I don't wanna run

174
00:10:24.453 --> 00:10:29.566
it anymore, issues with that

175
00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:35.404
game has already been declared.

176
00:10:35.404 --> 00:10:39.862
All right.

177
00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:51.967
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so

178
00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:56.581
game loop.

179
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.930
What did I say game23.

180
00:11:02.769 --> 00:11:07.690
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This is a problem, you
guys are supposed to be my spell check.

181
00:11:13.034 --> 00:11:18.030
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, all right
now I think we're ready, let's see.

182
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.700
So we have outer loop, inner loop,
found them, inner loop.

183
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.620
Should we look at it side by side maybe?

184
00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:39.242
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right let's see,
outer loop, inner loop,

185
00:11:39.242 --> 00:11:42.760
found them, we did make a mistake.

186
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:47.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's gonna go through
inner loop again, and then next

187
00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:52.286
time-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How did I get there?

188
00:11:52.286 --> 00:11:56.826
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I thought that's what

189
00:11:56.826 --> 00:11:58.310
we did, well.

190
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Then to
inner loop next times.

191
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
Why does it go through all of them.

192
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:06.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Going back
through both of the properties.

193
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.020
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's that?

194
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:10.847
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The part you missed was
the inner loop going through multiple

195
00:12:10.847 --> 00:12:11.710
properties.

196
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:17.250
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah well the
second we didn't finish the second one but

197
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.030
yeah, I think we
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And

198
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.390
our loop's gonna run twice,
cuz it's going through two different keys.

199
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:26.459
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and
it's also gonna be hitting this if,

200
00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:29.394
else which we'll be logging as well, cool.
