1
00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:02.935
So we're just back from our exercise.

2
00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:05.868
And the exercise was to create
an object using bracket and

3
00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.374
dot notation that represents
the characters and

4
00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:11.080
whatever related data you
may find in a game of Clue.

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.180
So what's the first thing I need to do?

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.220
Who wants to go first,
how about someone in the middle?

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.024
Anyone wanna volunteer themselves?

8
00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:26.420
The very first thing is
always the easiest one.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.579
Okay, what's the very first thing?

10
00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.437
&gt;&gt; You have to make an empty object.

11
00:00:31.437 --> 00:00:32.138
&gt;&gt; Yep.

12
00:00:32.138 --> 00:00:34.439
But what's the first
thing you need to type?

13
00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.949
&gt;&gt; Var.

14
00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:40.527
&gt;&gt; Okay, and
we initialize that as a object

15
00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:45.621
literal, put a semicolon in there.

16
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:51.515
All right, what's the very
next thing that we should do?

17
00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:52.971
&gt;&gt; Define a property.

18
00:00:52.971 --> 00:01:02.798
So do game.murderer="??"

19
00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:07.493
&gt;&gt; I like it, the mystery.

20
00:01:07.493 --> 00:01:08.589
What's the next thing?

21
00:01:12.657 --> 00:01:15.235
Flannel shirt.

22
00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:17.298
&gt;&gt; Another property for weapons.

23
00:01:17.298 --> 00:01:21.931
&gt;&gt; Weapons,
how do we do that without that notation?

24
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.469
Like this?

25
00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:32.630
&gt;&gt; You could do it with a string.

26
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

27
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.850
Okay.

28
00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.218
&gt;&gt; I made an array of-
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

29
00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:46.030
&gt;&gt; Of gun and-
&gt;&gt; Stuff like that?

30
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.477
&gt;&gt; Tank.

31
00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:49.356
&gt;&gt; All right, lazer beams.

32
00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:50.904
Oops, that's not how you spell laser.

33
00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:55.067
Lasers, angry cats.

34
00:02:00.442 --> 00:02:02.903
All right.

35
00:02:02.903 --> 00:02:05.284
Should I put Monster energy drink in here?

36
00:02:05.284 --> 00:02:10.639
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Awesome, so this is cool.

37
00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:16.723
Why would we choose an array
versus an object in this case?

38
00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:20.647
We haven't talked too much about when
we would choose one or the other.

39
00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:23.246
I'm assuming that you guys have
all used objects and arrays and

40
00:02:23.246 --> 00:02:26.399
have had to make that decision over
which data structure you're gonna use.

41
00:02:31.328 --> 00:02:36.043
&gt;&gt; Is it just easier to store a lot
more data inside of an array?

42
00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:37.522
&gt;&gt; The size doesn't really matter.

43
00:02:37.522 --> 00:02:42.199
It's more about the structure of
the data here since this is a collection

44
00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:46.198
of things that are the same
essentially and they don't have.

45
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.233
Yeah, basically it's because it's
a collection of things that are same,

46
00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:57.173
they're all weapons so
it's just a list of weapons.

47
00:02:57.173 --> 00:03:02.455
Versus an object is more like
a document you can think of it,

48
00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:07.856
you can make bigger things with it and
have more properties.

49
00:03:07.856 --> 00:03:11.481
But you can also make
an array of objects and

50
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:15.218
things like that, so you can combine them.

51
00:03:15.218 --> 00:03:22.473
So if I was gonna make an array of
objects here, How might I do that?

52
00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:26.713
Let me just break this
out into lines here,

53
00:03:30.264 --> 00:03:31.926
Just so we have space.

54
00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:40.348
So an object has a key and a value, right?

55
00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:43.000
So what could be the key here?

56
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.959
&gt;&gt; Weapon one, weapon two.

57
00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.413
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well the thing is we
have indexes and so we can line

58
00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:53.908
up anything that has a number like
that we'll just refer to as the index.

59
00:03:53.908 --> 00:04:00.371
So weapon one or
zero would be lasers, etc.

60
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:04.616
Two would be dish soap, very deadly.

61
00:04:07.312 --> 00:04:11.918
So what would be a property name?

62
00:04:14.982 --> 00:04:21.031
You can call a property name also a key,
just so you know it's the same thing.

63
00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:22.346
Property name.

64
00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:26.106
All right, how about,
who is next in the list?

65
00:04:26.106 --> 00:04:30.633
How about a friend in the way back?

66
00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:34.305
&gt;&gt; Well you have to have
say maybe lasers and

67
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:38.085
then the location that the lasers are at.

68
00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:41.688
So you would do the lasers, colon,

69
00:04:41.688 --> 00:04:46.140
and then the string of
like found in the lab.

70
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.310
&gt;&gt; Hm, okay, that's interesting.

71
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.520
You could do that, that's valid.

72
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.779
But I would recommend having
a property name that is

73
00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.560
consistent among your objects.

74
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.258
So for example, I would say to do

75
00:05:03.258 --> 00:05:07.434
maybe type: 'Lasers' and

76
00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:11.450
then location: 'Lab'.

77
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.220
Do you guys see the difference there?

78
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.769
Because now each of these data structures
has a type, it has a location, and

79
00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:20.043
we can organize our data around that,

80
00:05:20.043 --> 00:05:24.830
versus having to know what the property
name is for a specific thing every time.

81
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.050
So if the property name was lasers and
here it was angry cats,

82
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.640
we may have to remember that.

83
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.390
Whereas we could just say weapon set
type and it returns lasers, awesome,

84
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.637
we don't have to remember the specific
string that's stored there.

85
00:05:39.533 --> 00:05:41.528
And this is a pattern.

86
00:05:47.656 --> 00:05:50.191
Etc., cool.

87
00:05:50.191 --> 00:05:51.858
What else might we have in our game?

88
00:05:55.722 --> 00:06:00.024
You guys know the rest of this,
right, would be the same pattern.

89
00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:02.873
&gt;&gt; Maybe character's name?

90
00:06:02.873 --> 00:06:04.216
&gt;&gt; Character's name?

91
00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:06.887
&gt;&gt; Of the game.

92
00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:08.417
&gt;&gt; The name of the game?

93
00:06:08.417 --> 00:06:10.486
Name the game.

94
00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:14.735
&gt;&gt; No, like Mr. White [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; The characters.

95
00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:17.220
How would I do that?

96
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.070
&gt;&gt; The way I did I did,
I guess it would be game.name and

97
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:28.034
then I pass an array with different
nicknames saved as a string.

98
00:06:28.034 --> 00:06:29.582
&gt;&gt; Cool.

99
00:06:29.582 --> 00:06:37.106
So someone know a name
of a character of Clue?

100
00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:38.338
&gt;&gt; Miss Scarlet.

101
00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:42.242
&gt;&gt; 'Miss Scarlet'.

102
00:06:42.242 --> 00:06:47.472
All right and brown sweater,
I'm sorry, I don't know your names.

103
00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:48.689
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Peacock.

104
00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:50.876
&gt;&gt; Well actually my question is
a little bit different, sorry.

105
00:06:50.876 --> 00:06:55.007
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; How will we add Miss Scarlet to that

106
00:06:55.007 --> 00:07:01.204
array, Without just putting
it in there an array literal?

107
00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:05.624
So this is array literal where
we just pop it in there, but

108
00:07:05.624 --> 00:07:09.041
we wanna add it later or
add it dynamically.

109
00:07:09.041 --> 00:07:11.788
&gt;&gt; You'd do a bracket notation,
or just [CROSSTALK]

110
00:07:11.788 --> 00:07:14.151
&gt;&gt; Sure, tell me exactly what to type.

111
00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:19.526
Pretend like I'm, what's that,
Dragon dictation software?

112
00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:20.281
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

113
00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:25.601
But, game.name[0].

114
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.228
&gt;&gt; Oops.

115
00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:30.474
&gt;&gt; Equals.

116
00:07:30.474 --> 00:07:32.255
&gt;&gt; Nice.

117
00:07:32.255 --> 00:07:33.304
Perfect.

118
00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:34.948
&gt;&gt; Semicolon if you want it.

119
00:07:34.948 --> 00:07:36.448
&gt;&gt; I do want it.

120
00:07:36.448 --> 00:07:38.840
Is anyone here anti-semicolon?

121
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.260
Okay, just wondering if we
could still be friends.

122
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.595
Just kidding,
I don't engage in those silly things.

123
00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:48.094
But I do use semicolons.

124
00:07:50.353 --> 00:07:51.540
Awesome.

125
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.090
&gt;&gt; Or push.

126
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can use push.

127
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.634
What does push do?

128
00:07:57.634 --> 00:08:02.189
&gt;&gt; In the green sweatshirt
&gt;&gt; Puts it at the front of the array.

129
00:08:02.189 --> 00:08:05.101
&gt;&gt; Puts it at the back of the array.

130
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:06.201
But, yeah.

131
00:08:09.417 --> 00:08:15.430
So then an array would
look something like this,

132
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:21.158
Miss Scarlet and then Mr.
Green, or does it?

133
00:08:21.158 --> 00:08:22.923
Can someone tell me
what's wrong with this?

134
00:08:28.224 --> 00:08:32.223
How about black sweatshirt.

135
00:08:32.223 --> 00:08:33.593
&gt;&gt; Me?
Mm-hm.

136
00:08:33.593 --> 00:08:35.056
&gt;&gt; What's wrong with the array?

137
00:08:35.056 --> 00:08:36.588
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

138
00:08:36.588 --> 00:08:41.267
Or what's wrong, so we just added,
we used the push method.

139
00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:42.356
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

140
00:08:42.356 --> 00:08:44.774
&gt;&gt; And I was saying we want
it to look like this, and

141
00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.632
now I'm hinting that maybe
there's something wrong.

142
00:08:47.632 --> 00:08:50.802
&gt;&gt; You already have Mr.
Green there [CROSSTALK]

143
00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:54.228
&gt;&gt; Well, this is not real.

144
00:08:54.228 --> 00:08:59.285
This is what we want, and
I'm hinting that maybe this line is wrong.

145
00:09:02.925 --> 00:09:04.637
How did we add Miss Scarlet before?

146
00:09:06.739 --> 00:09:07.876
&gt;&gt; Used a bracket.

147
00:09:07.876 --> 00:09:11.088
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, but what's the difference
between line 14 and 15?

148
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.005
&gt;&gt; I blank out when I'm put on the spot.

149
00:09:15.005 --> 00:09:15.623
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's okay.

150
00:09:15.623 --> 00:09:18.690
&gt;&gt; You have the half
circles there [CROSSTALK]

151
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.481
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is a method.

152
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:22.745
Absolutely, but what about this part?

153
00:09:25.143 --> 00:09:27.111
&gt;&gt; The name property.

154
00:09:27.111 --> 00:09:31.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're pushing it to
the game which is an object.

155
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.500
So we can't push things to an object,
we can only push things to an array.

156
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:41.455
So what we need to get to that point
was we just need to reference the next

157
00:09:41.455 --> 00:09:42.780
nested property.

158
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:50.690
Cool, so now we're gonna move on unless we
have any questions to nested properties.

159
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.260
What's up?

160
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.560
&gt;&gt; Just a little circle back from
the previous before the break.

161
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.466
If we were to assign game as a array, so

162
00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:04.360
then it would still work
as an array of objects?

163
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.450
&gt;&gt; So you're saying if we just did this?

164
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:11.202
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

165
00:10:11.202 --> 00:10:13.493
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
everything would work exactly the same.
