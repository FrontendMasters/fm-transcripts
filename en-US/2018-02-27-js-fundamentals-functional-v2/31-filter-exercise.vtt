00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.621
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're gonna start
off with a quick recap on where we are in

2
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:05.243
our investigation so far.

3
00:00:05.243 --> 00:00:08.572
Really, we've just gotten started, but

4
00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:13.016
we've learned that things
aren't always as they seem.

5
00:00:13.016 --> 00:00:18.425
What was an example of things being
a little bit different than we expected?

6
00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:21.161
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A raise in objects?

7
00:00:21.161 --> 00:00:23.734
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
a raise in objects, that was a big one.

8
00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.353
Anything else that comes to mind?

9
00:00:30.924 --> 00:00:32.979
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No,
that's the one I was asking for.

10
00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.624
Cool, so our detective team,
we're here working together,

11
00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:40.474
we have a lot of skills and
working with and manipulating data, and

12
00:00:40.474 --> 00:00:44.014
we're just getting better and
better by the minute really.

13
00:00:44.014 --> 00:00:49.633
And, our team of elves,
who are secretly helping us out,

14
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.202
were really hard at work last night.

15
00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:57.964
And Justin,
we have some data that they scraped

16
00:00:57.964 --> 00:01:02.847
from some video footage
at the mansion where Mr.

17
00:01:02.847 --> 00:01:07.032
Body, is thought to have been murdered.

18
00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.404
And we have this object of dat,

19
00:01:09.404 --> 00:01:14.161
luckily our data scrapers
are also JavaScript programmers.

20
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.914
We only associate with people
who program in JavaScript, so

21
00:01:17.914 --> 00:01:19.613
we choose our team wisely.

22
00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:22.086
So we have this data to get us started.

23
00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:26.024
And now let's just kick
off with a quick exercise,

24
00:01:26.024 --> 00:01:31.337
where we're gonna filter through
this data, and we wanna figure out

25
00:01:31.337 --> 00:01:37.400
who was present in this video footage,
at the mansion the night of the murder.

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.105
So what is filter?

27
00:01:39.105 --> 00:01:42.644
Has anyone used filter before
in underscore or low dash?

28
00:01:42.644 --> 00:01:44.083
A couple of people.

29
00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:49.472
So, filter is a function that
takes an array in a callback.

30
00:01:49.472 --> 00:01:54.270
And it is going to return a new array,
this is similar to map,

31
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.222
its going to return a new
array that will contain,

32
00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:03.113
this is the important part of
filters that it will only contain

33
00:02:03.113 --> 00:02:06.900
the values that return
true from the callback.

34
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.606
So the callback has to return a boolean,
either true or false.

35
00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:16.772
If that callback returns true,
then we're going to save it to the array.

36
00:02:16.772 --> 00:02:18.617
If not, we won't.

37
00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:22.596
So, with map, when we loop through
all of the items in our list,

38
00:02:22.596 --> 00:02:26.164
we returned an array that was
at the same length, right?

39
00:02:26.164 --> 00:02:27.488
Every time.

40
00:02:27.488 --> 00:02:32.431
With filter that's not always true, filter
can be shorter than the original array.

41
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:39.700
It really depends on our callback function
and if it's returning true or false.

42
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.559
We also call this particular kind
of callback function a truth test.

43
00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.593
Yeah.
