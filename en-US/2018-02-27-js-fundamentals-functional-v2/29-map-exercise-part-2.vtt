00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
our next task is to implement map.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.870
What are some things we may want to
consider when we're implementing map?

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.040
What's the difference between
when we implemented each?

4
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:17.917
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Map returns an array.

5
00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:18.549
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yup.

6
00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:19.790
Map returns an array.

7
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.890
So we'll need to.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.430
Have a return statement
in there somewhere.

9
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.750
We'll need to create an array,
perhaps, to store data.

10
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.230
What's the same, what's similar?

11
00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:38.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Iterates through each.

12
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.719
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm,
yeah, iterates through a list.

13
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.840
Exactly.

14
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.520
So, there's two ways you can do this,
you guys are gonna hate me.

15
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.380
But, the first way you can
do it with a loop, right?

16
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.540
Second way is that you can use each,
instead of a loop, so.

17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.480
That's the task.

18
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.670
Are you guys ready?

19
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.220
Any questions before we get started?

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.802
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we're gonna implement map just like we

21
00:01:14.802 --> 00:01:16.182
implemented each.

22
00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:17.076
