1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.300
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so
we're taking it a little more advanced.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.760
It is going to let me?

3
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.695
Okay, this one is working.

4
00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:13.283
Okay, so let's save our whatever

5
00:00:13.283 --> 00:00:20.240
this return gets saved into here.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.450
Whatever this returns,
you could save in here, right.

7
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.520
So let us start with this one.

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.660
Who is next?

9
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.620
Who just went last?

10
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.666
You, OK.
What happens

11
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:39.760
first?
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: It

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.599
is a brand new [INAUDIBLE] continue
from where you highlighted.

13
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.941
we are calling this function, that's where

15
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:52.963
I would like to start.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: So then you

16
00:00:52.963 --> 00:01:00.000
are saying that the my alert to funcalert?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm,

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.210
but we have to,
since we are calling the function,

18
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.180
we need to go into the body
of the function, right.

19
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.580
So we go into the body of the function,

20
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.930
what's the first thing that happens?
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: To find

21
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.450
the variable X with a string help.

22
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.460
I think I find a clue.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep

23
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.850
and Josh, what happens next?
&gt;&gt; Josh: Setting

24
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.520
a counter.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

25
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.030
initializing a counter a zero.

26
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.496
Awesome, Ginny?
&gt;&gt; Ginny: In setting

27
00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:35.940
a function to "lerter.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

28
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.000
then Cameron what happens next?
&gt;&gt; Cameron: An alert with the string and

29
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.070
every count we're on.

30
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.510
In this case zero.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

31
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.590
you say that it's going
to call the function?

32
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.240
Where is it being invoked?
&gt;&gt; Cameron: Right.

33
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.702
It returns alerter next.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah so

34
00:02:01.702 --> 00:02:08.751
it returns whatever value is held,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right,

35
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:13.100
and the value that it's held
is a body of a function.

36
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.775
So the body of the function
is now funcAlert.

37
00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:22.472
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Thumbs, are we good?

38
00:02:22.472 --> 00:02:28.085
Make sense, okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now,

39
00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:33.990
what happens next?

40
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.809
Chris?
&gt;&gt; Chris: So then would it go to

41
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.372
the constant funcalert2 equals my

42
00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:47.220
alert to call the function again?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,

43
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.750
it would call the function a whole other
time, and just like we mentioned before,

44
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.470
we'll create a new execution context.

45
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.050
All of these things get re-initialized.

46
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.650
So we have a new instance of the string
in memory, we have the new counter.

47
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.730
We create a new function, and
then we return that function, and

48
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.888
we have it now in this funcalert2, okay?

49
00:03:12.888 --> 00:03:17.615
Then what happens?

50
00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:20.967
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: I want to

51
00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:26.907
jump and be like, it's gonna return,
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: It's

52
00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:31.578
gonna call the function

53
00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:36.613
body of the alerter.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's right,

54
00:03:36.613 --> 00:03:37.883
that's right.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: That right?

55
00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:38.624
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

56
00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:39.314
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Okay, cool.

57
00:03:39.314 --> 00:03:39.814
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

58
00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:40.314
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: All right

59
00:03:40.314 --> 00:03:41.776
then, that's what I've been going for
the whole time.

60
00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:44.161
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]

61
00:03:44.161 --> 00:03:48.250
Yeah, no, your intuition is on the mark.

62
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.085
So because my alert returns this function

63
00:03:54.085 --> 00:03:59.512
body,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We

64
00:03:59.512 --> 00:04:00.640
can reference it, right?

65
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.650
We talked about this in
the scope exercise too, and so

66
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.190
what is this gonna be Jamie?
&gt;&gt; Jamie: Is it gonna alert

67
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.505
help I think I found a clue?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

68
00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.445
&gt;&gt; Jamie: And then, one?

69
00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:22.276
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, yep, exactly.

70
00:04:22.276 --> 00:04:27.717
So now, what happens

71
00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:37.089
if we do this?
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Okay so

72
00:04:37.089 --> 00:04:41.359
it's gonna go back to the body,

73
00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:45.954
alerter.
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

74
00:04:45.954 --> 00:04:46.501
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's a trick

75
00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:47.630
question.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Hang

76
00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.670
on.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

77
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.520
this.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: No it's not.

78
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.514
If anything its going to [INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This is going to call,

79
00:04:53.514 --> 00:04:58.800
this is going to invoke, or
try to invoke whatever this returns.

80
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.410
What does this return.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: An

81
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:01.770
alert screen.

82
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.550
Like an alert.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But

83
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.570
it doesn't return anything.

84
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:04.420
It just alerts.

85
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.920
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: It doesn't

86
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.628
return anything.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

87
00:05:05.628 --> 00:05:08.809
it just returns on the fine.
So trick question.

88
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.426
That won't work,

89
00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:12.620
cool.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Okay so

90
00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.850
it's like a one and done?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well, not exactly,

91
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.100
because we could just reference,
we could just run this line again.

92
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.250
Now what's going to happen?

93
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.887
Aisha?
&gt;&gt; Aisha: Adds another,

94
00:05:31.887 --> 00:05:34.880
it iterates.
&gt;&gt; Aisha: Or no,

95
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.953
it starts over again.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well.

96
00:05:39.384 --> 00:05:40.026
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: These are the

97
00:05:40.026 --> 00:05:41.199
important questions.

98
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.320
Does it start again,
or does it keep adding?

99
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.014
So, in this case,
my alert created one execution context and

100
00:05:53.014 --> 00:06:01.850
then when we call funcalert we are
recreating some child execution context.

101
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.580
But we are not recreating
the parent execution context, okay?

102
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.625
So we are actually are retaining access to

103
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:13.627
count.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just like before

104
00:06:13.627 --> 00:06:18.411
when we were doing that, do you remember?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

105
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:23.845
every time we call this,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's

106
00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:27.739
gonna increment this, so the next time
it'll be two, and then three, etc.

107
00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:31.577
That make sense?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Can I get thumbs

108
00:06:31.577 --> 00:06:32.242
on that?

109
00:06:32.242 --> 00:06:32.800
We're good?

110
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.980
If you had a side thumb or a down thumb,
feel free to ask a question cuz it's

111
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.150
gonna get a little weirder in a second.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Okay it just

112
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.740
iterates count in the parent scope.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It

113
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.390
incriments it.

114
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.910
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: It
incriments it.

115
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.460
Does it?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

116
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:48.490
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Okay, cool.

117
00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.380
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: In its parent scope

118
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.496
that's created by this call.

119
00:06:51.496 --> 00:06:58.920
However, or and,
we created another execution

120
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.666
context from my alert a second time.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Yeah, but

121
00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:04.212
that's still zero.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, and so

122
00:07:04.212 --> 00:07:09.422
it's still gonna be zero
because they're separate,

123
00:07:09.422 --> 00:07:14.136
yeah?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

124
00:07:14.136 --> 00:07:17.840
you guys are the smartest
group I have had so far.

125
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.910
You really are getting anything,
or you are lying to me,

126
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.033
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: The right

127
00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:25.991
answers.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yea

128
00:07:25.991 --> 00:07:27.100
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: I'm

129
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.818
just lying.

130
00:07:27.818 --> 00:07:30.082
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Female Student: And

131
00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:33.202
possibilities of what I think it is,
tell me.

132
00:07:33.202 --> 00:07:34.186
[CROSSTALK] [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Really

133
00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:36.290
good at guessing first, right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yea,

134
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.570
it's a good skill to have.

135
00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:44.210
Okay, so let's just check this out.

136
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.700
Okay, so then we have our funcalert.

137
00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:54.190
Okay, it's kind of small, but it says,
help I think I found a clue 1.

138
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.080
Great, and then we can do it again and
then this says 2.

139
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:03.272
Can you guys probably can't even see that,
super small, and then 3 great.

140
00:08:03.272 --> 00:08:08.943
So funcAlert2,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is

141
00:08:08.943 --> 00:08:14.535
gonna start one.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

142
00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:17.320
two, so they're separate.

143
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.180
So it's retaining a memory
of its parent's scope, but

144
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.410
it's different than this other
function's parent scope.

145
00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:29.230
And that's a really important
concept to remember,

146
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:34.110
because it's kind of
the core of how everything

147
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.840
sort of fits together in Script.
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Male Student: Feel like

148
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:41.950
two different states right now.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, yeah.

149
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.330
Well you have a few, depending on how you

150
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.100
divide it up, but I see what you mean.

151
00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.030
Okay, that was fun.

152
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.115
I like that one.

153
00:08:54.115 --> 00:08:56.325
