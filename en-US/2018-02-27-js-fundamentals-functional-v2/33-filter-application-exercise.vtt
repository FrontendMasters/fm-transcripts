00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:03.935
So now we're going to take our filter and
we're going to apply it to our data.

2
00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:07.992
Remember we have our data here,
it scrolls, so just copy and

3
00:00:07.992 --> 00:00:09.354
paste from the top.

4
00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:17.854
Put it into your text editor or
whatever you're using, and

5
00:00:17.854 --> 00:00:22.545
then you're going to use your
filter to filter this data.

6
00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:24.509
You wanna see who is present.

7
00:00:26.243 --> 00:00:27.650
That night.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.816
Hint, there's a flag here, a flag is
just a property that says true or false.

9
00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:38.044
There's a flag here that says if
the suspect was present at the mansion.

10
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.200
So, let's use filter and
return an array of these objects.

11
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:50.308
Containing only people that were present.
