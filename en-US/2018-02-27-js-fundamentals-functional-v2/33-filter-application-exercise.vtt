00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca: So
now we're gonna take our filter and

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.000
we're gonna apply it to our data.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.931
Remember, we have our data here,
it scrolls, so just copy and

4
00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:09.200
paste from the top.

5
00:00:12.924 --> 00:00:17.868
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Put it into your text editor or
whatever you're using and

6
00:00:17.868 --> 00:00:22.720
then you're gonna use your
filter to filter this data.

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.737
You want to see who was
present that night.

8
00:00:26.737 --> 00:00:30.680
Hint, there is a flag here.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.900
A flag is just a property
that says true or false.

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.259
There's a flag here that says,
if the suspect was present at the mansion.

11
00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:45.868
So let's use filter and
return an array of these objects,

12
00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:50.113
containing only people that were present.
