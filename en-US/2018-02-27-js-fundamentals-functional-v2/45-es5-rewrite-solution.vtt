00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.664
Our challenge was to rewrite this
function in iOS six step one would be

2
00:00:04.664 --> 00:00:09.032
to identify what feature exists that
isn't available in iOS six, and

3
00:00:09.032 --> 00:00:11.120
that is this default parameter.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.840
So we have to work with what we got.

5
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.099
And the most common way my goodness, good
all this craziness, the most common way.

6
00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.433
Okay, let's move over,

7
00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:33.161
the most common way to do this

8
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:37.889
is to simply slow all kinds of

9
00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:42.431
weird anyone does matter.

10
00:00:45.113 --> 00:00:47.910
Is to say b=b, right?

11
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.480
So if b has value,
great, or what was it 2?

12
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:55.980
Yeah.

13
00:00:58.652 --> 00:01:06.948
That's how he did it before So
what this is the or operator.

14
00:01:06.948 --> 00:01:13.810
So this will only evaluate
one side if it's true.

15
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.626
So to say if this is true,
it'll just stop and

16
00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:23.160
then it'll just return,
great, for the an operator.

17
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.124
This is good for if you want it to
check if something is true, and

18
00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:31.220
then do the second thing.

19
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.260
So this one says if b exists,
then the value is 2,

20
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.980
so it's kinda a little bit unusual.

21
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.293
Way of using these logic operators
as a way to kinda do if else kinda

22
00:01:48.293 --> 00:01:54.310
statements in one line, but
that's the most common one just like that.

23
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.663
Cool, have you guys seen things like this?

24
00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.109
We're using the F in the end.
