00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Our challenge was to
rewrite this function in ES6.

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.273
Step one, would be to identify
what feature exists that

3
00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:11.090
isn't available in ES6, and
that is this default parameter.

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.014
So we have to work with what we've got.

5
00:00:16.803 --> 00:00:22.970
&gt;&gt; Bianca: And the most common way, my
goodness, look at all of this craziness.

6
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.449
The most common way,
okay, let's move over.

7
00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:36.284
The most common way to
do this is to simply,

8
00:00:36.284 --> 00:00:41.560
it's all kinds of weird.

9
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.270
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

10
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.059
Is to say b equals b, all right, so

11
00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.260
if b has value, great or what was it?

12
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.160
Two?

13
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.724
Yeah, that's how

14
00:01:00.724 --> 00:01:05.007
we did it before.

15
00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:05.862
Any questions?

16
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.440
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Has anyone done
this before in their code?

17
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.810
Yeah?

18
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.228
Raise your hand if you have.

19
00:01:18.228 --> 00:01:20.690
A couple people about half of us, yeah.

20
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.555
So what this is is the OR operator.

21
00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:29.580
So this will only evaluate
one side if it's true.

22
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:37.371
So it'll say, if this is true, it'll
just stop, and it'll just return, great.

23
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:40.671
For the AND operator, this is good for

24
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:46.772
if you wanted to check if something
is true, then do the second thing.

25
00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:53.591
So this one says,
if the exists then the values two.

26
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:58.785
So it's kind of a little bit
unusual way of using these

27
00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:06.300
logic operators as a way to kind of do
if-else kind of statements in one line.

28
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.070
But that's the most common one,
just like that.

29
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.264
Cool, have you guys seen things like this?

30
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.933
&gt;&gt; Bianca: We're using the if and the and.
