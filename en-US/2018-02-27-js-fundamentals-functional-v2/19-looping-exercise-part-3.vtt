00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:04.380
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The exercise is to
destructure this nested data structure

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.290
into two variables with
the strings red and orange.

3
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.430
So at the end of this,
you should have two variables,

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.550
one should hold the value red and
the next should hold the value orange.
