00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:02.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so
we're going to talk about advanced scope.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.070
So this is our second
time talking about scope.

3
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.690
Are you guys ready for this?

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.437
This is gonna require us
to do the thing where

5
00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:16.850
we run it together, so
we have to be ready.

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.850
So we gotta stretch and
we're gonna do some advanced scope here.

7
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.890
Okay, so we have a function called alert.

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.240
Let's just call it here.

9
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.960
Normally, I would trick you into
saying that it's already called but

10
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.720
it hadn't actually been invoked yet.

11
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.158
But since we're running low on time,
I'll just skip to the meat of it.

12
00:00:46.158 --> 00:00:49.464
All right, who wants to go first?

13
00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:51.308
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Constant of
x is set to that string,

14
00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:55.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Inside the function.

15
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, well first
we have to set it up, then we call it.

16
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I thought
we skipped that part too.

17
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.626
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, you're right,
we didn't skip that part,

18
00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:02.305
but yeah, you're right.

19
00:01:02.305 --> 00:01:04.926
And then we do this, right,

20
00:01:04.926 --> 00:01:10.730
we save the string into the x constant,
and then what happens?

21
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Then we set another constant
alerter, which describes another function.

22
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.034
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, typo.

23
00:01:23.554 --> 00:01:24.260
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

24
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.555
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Then we run alerter and

25
00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:33.190
as in constant x into the alert method.

26
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.483
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm,
do you know what alert does?

27
00:01:36.483 --> 00:01:38.163
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It pops up on your window.

28
00:01:38.163 --> 00:01:42.220
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, it does,
but only if you aren't masking it.

29
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.080
I hate that this, see how it has this bug.

30
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.150
Anyway, I give up.

31
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.530
You wanna rename this.

32
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.490
This is gonna give us an error.

33
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.510
So alert, this is gonna call itself.

34
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.230
And it's gonna just go
over cursing forever.

35
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.410
So make sure that it's myAlert, cool?

36
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.680
So we have an alert that pops up and
it says, help, I think I found a clue.
