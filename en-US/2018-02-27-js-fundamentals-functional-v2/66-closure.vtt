00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.496
All right, so
we're gonna talk about advanced scope.

2
00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:05.324
So this is our second
time talking about scope.

3
00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:06.494
You guys ready for this?

4
00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:13.983
This is gonna require us to do
the thing where we run it together.

5
00:00:13.983 --> 00:00:16.671
So we have to be ready.

6
00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:21.636
So we gotta stretch we're gonna do

7
00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:25.581
some advanced scope here.

8
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:32.466
Okay, so we have a function called alert.

9
00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:35.159
Let's just call it here.

10
00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:36.525
All right, who wants to go first?

11
00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:44.222
&gt;&gt; Constant of x is set to that
string inside the function.

12
00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:47.948
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, first,
we have to set it up, then we'd call it.

13
00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:49.039
&gt;&gt; I thought we skipped that part.

14
00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.591
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right.

15
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.444
We didn't skip that part.

16
00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.410
But yeah, you're right.

17
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.347
Then we do this, right?

18
00:00:52.347 --> 00:00:58.306
We save the string into the x constant,

19
00:00:58.306 --> 00:01:01.923
and then what happens?

20
00:01:01.923 --> 00:01:09.048
&gt;&gt; Then we set another constant alerter,
which describes another function.

21
00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:13.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, typo, Okay.

22
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:22.560
&gt;&gt; Then we run alerter and
As in constant x into the alert method.

23
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.542
&gt;&gt; Do you know what alert does?

24
00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:27.157
&gt;&gt; Pops up on your window?

25
00:01:27.157 --> 00:01:31.422
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does but
only if you aren't masking it.

26
00:01:31.422 --> 00:01:36.314
[INAUDIBLE]
see how has this

27
00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:40.766
bug anyway, I give up.

28
00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.556
You want to rename this?

29
00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:45.929
This is gonna give us an error.

30
00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:51.999
So alert, this is gonna call itself and
it's gonna just go over cursing forever.

31
00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:56.122
So make sure that it's myAlert.

32
00:01:56.122 --> 00:02:00.620
Cool, so, we have an alert that pops up
and it says, help, I think I found a clue.
