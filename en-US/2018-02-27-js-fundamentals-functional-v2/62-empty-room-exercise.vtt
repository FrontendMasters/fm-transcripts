00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
so exercise two.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.290
We have some data, and it's updated.

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.536
We have a new development from our team of
elves, who are doing a lot of research and

4
00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:17.107
helping us figure out who the murderer is
while we're here strengthening our skills.

5
00:00:17.107 --> 00:00:24.560
We need to figure out which room no
one was in on the night of the murder.

6
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.490
So this is updated with the rooms that
people were in on the night of the murder.

7
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where can we find that?

8
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's on the slides.

9
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.983
Let's see, yeah, and

10
00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:51.385
the link is jsbin.com/pazixim/edit,
pazixim.

11
00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.645
And so you can use any methods, and

12
00:00:54.645 --> 00:01:00.045
I encourage you actually to
take a peek at either Lodash or

13
00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:04.770
Underscore, whichever one that you prefer,
and

14
00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.410
see what methods could be useful for
doing this.

15
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.368
And again we are doing this by methods,
not by writing it out and

16
00:01:13.368 --> 00:01:15.670
not figuring out or
reading it or anything like that.

17
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.790
Cuz if you imagine that
this was a huge data set,

18
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.460
you couldn't do that on your own.
