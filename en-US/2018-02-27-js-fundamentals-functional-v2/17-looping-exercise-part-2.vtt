00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.550
all the properties of the suspect
objects and the suspects array.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.190
So you wanna be looping through name,
color, name, color.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.566
And while you're at it, if you have
a hunch on who you think is guilty,

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:22.430
why not just mark it?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And how you mark it,

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.707
