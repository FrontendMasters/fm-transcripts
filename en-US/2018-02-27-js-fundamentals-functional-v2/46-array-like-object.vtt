1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.515
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great, so
we're gonna talk about the arguments,

2
00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:05.990
array-like objects, a little bit more.

3
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.140
But first, let's run this code,
see what happens.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.180
Who wants to go first?

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.630
Someone probably wants to go first
cuz there's a crazy line here.

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.100
So whoever goes first
doesn't have to do that line.

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.620
For sure.

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.713
No takers,
you guys all want to do line two?

9
00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:36.639
All right, lets see,
Jenny can you choose someone to go.

10
00:00:36.639 --> 00:00:40.580
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Lets

11
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.055
say two people directly behind me.

12
00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:46.041
Is there, nope,
there's no one directly behind me, sorry.

13
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:47.720
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
am I starting it off?

14
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.132
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yup.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Or do line two?

15
00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:52.176
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's a gift
really cuz it's the easiest one.

16
00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:54.870
What's the very first thing that
happens in this code block?

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So we declare accounts
variable and give it a function.

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.400
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so we're creating
this definition somewhere in memory.

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.760
Great, which way you wanna go,
left or right?

20
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.108
Who do you like better?

21
00:01:10.108 --> 00:01:11.327
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Ohhh!
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]

22
00:01:11.327 --> 00:01:12.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

23
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.140
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just kidding!

24
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm gonna go with my guy,
Ben over there.

25
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna skip!

26
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.780
Okay.

27
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.924
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: He's in my
fantasy football team league.

28
00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:23.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I lost to him last

29
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.230
time, so [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]

30
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.580
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And just so you know,

31
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.800
it's gonna go this way now,
so be prepared.

32
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.710
Did you see that, Dan?

33
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.640
It's gonna go this way, okay.

34
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.830
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So we just jumped
over the declarations there, right?

35
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so
we jumped over the function body, and

36
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.670
now we're-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Now,

37
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.110
we are currently calling the constructArr

38
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.930
function with the Passing
at the arguments was it in.

39
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.748
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That
sounds really bad actually.

40
00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:56.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Man, ok, Dan?

41
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.960
&gt;&gt; Dan: The question is
what is running next?

42
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.988
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
what happens next?

43
00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:02.920
&gt;&gt; Dan: The function
body is going to get run?

44
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.140
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so
we'll jump into the function body, and

45
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.054
then what happens?

46
00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:13.459
&gt;&gt; Dan: New variables declared.

47
00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.341
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

48
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:16.140
&gt;&gt; Dan: Array or ARR.

49
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We declare a variable

50
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.430
R, and we assign it to something crazy.

51
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.560
Ryan, do you want to take
a stab at what's happening?

52
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So you

53
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.450
assign it to the arguments
that were called, was it in.

54
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.550
But prototype slice,

55
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.030
I mean, you are going to create
a slice of an array somehow, but

56
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.180
I'm not really sure what
mechanically happens at that point.

57
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.900
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
a little bit crazy.

58
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.840
What this does is it will
take an array-like object and

59
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.030
turn it into an array.

60
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.571
So basically,
what it's doing is it's referencing

61
00:03:05.571 --> 00:03:11.984
the slice method that comes with arrays,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

62
00:03:11.984 --> 00:03:16.310
passing it that,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's passing it

63
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.270
the argument pseudo array as the context.

64
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.498
And as a result of that,
it gets It turns an object

65
00:03:26.498 --> 00:03:32.497
like an array like object into an array,
array.

66
00:03:35.523 --> 00:03:36.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does that make sense?

67
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.990
You don't have to understand
what this stuff is doing.

68
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.678
Just know that this craziness is going to
turn this argument's object into an array.

69
00:03:46.678 --> 00:03:49.413
Yeah?

70
00:03:49.413 --> 00:03:52.148
Cool.

71
00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.237
And then.

72
00:03:53.237 --> 00:03:55.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Is this
the cannonical way of doing that,

73
00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.710
of taking that pseudo arguments array?

74
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.360
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pretty much.

75
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.404
Has anyone done it a different way?

76
00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:05.858
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
this is the way I've always done it.

77
00:04:09.556 --> 00:04:14.170
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so array is
now an array that looks like what?

78
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.421
Let's just, man really?

79
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:20.236
This is not how it's supposed to work,
okay.

80
00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:26.330
So what is ARR look like at this point,
Jenny?

81
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.390
I'm going to write it out first.

82
00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: What does it
look like at this point?

83
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.880
I don't know what to say right now.

84
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.
So do you remember what happened here?

85
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.160
In this craziness?

86
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah,
it took the string-looking array and

87
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.700
turned it into an array.

88
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and so
what does that array look like?

89
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.371
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So it's got the brackets and

90
00:04:53.371 --> 00:05:00.359
then the was it in separate
pieces of the array?

91
00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:03.022
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, exactly.

92
00:05:03.022 --> 00:05:04.050
Cool.

93
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.670
And then, Josh what happens next?

94
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:09.779
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Push the billiards
room onto that array.

95
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.570
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

96
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So it ends up on the end.

97
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.120
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's that?

98
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It ends up on the end.

99
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.660
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, so
now we have an array that looks like this.

100
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.760
The billiards room.

101
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.728
And then, Altimere,
what are we going to return?

102
00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So, you do need some sort of
manipulation with the join of that array.

103
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:46.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, the join method
is a native array method that's going to

104
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.250
take all of the indices and

105
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.060
join it with whatever character you
give here, so I just put a space.

106
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.240
So it's going to join it with the space.

107
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.979
So it'll say,
was it in the billiards room?

108
00:06:02.344 --> 00:06:07.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
that's what we just did.

109
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.310
How do we feel about that?

110
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.940
Makes sense?
Any questions about anything in there?

111
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Is it returning a string?

112
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.
