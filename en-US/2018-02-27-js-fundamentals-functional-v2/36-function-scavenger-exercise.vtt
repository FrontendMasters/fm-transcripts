&gt;&gt; Bianca: So, I'm gonna send
you guys on a scavenger hunt.

2
00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:07.793
You wanna find definitions, function
names, where things are being invocated,

3
00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:11.419
arguments, parameters, function bodies,
and where there are return values and

4
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:12.784
where there are side effects.

5
00:00:12.784 --> 00:00:17.269
I didn't mention the last part, so return
values are anything that's explicitly

6
00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:19.630
returned, in this case an ES5 at least.

7
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.890
It's explicitly returned with
a return statement, right?

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.020
You see the word return then it's
something that's being returned.

9
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.280
And then side effects are things
that are happening other than

10
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.210
returning the value that effects
something outside of that function.

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.110
So, console.log for
example is a side effect,

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.820
because you are logging to the console
that exists outside of that function.

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.250
That's a side effect.

14
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.440
Or if you're changing the value of
an object that's in a different scope.

15
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.450
That's a side effect.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Cool?

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.260
Are we clear on kind of the trickier
points of side effects versus return,

17
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.700
invocation versus definition,
and parameters versus arguments?
