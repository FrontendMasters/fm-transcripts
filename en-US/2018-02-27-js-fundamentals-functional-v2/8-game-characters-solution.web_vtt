WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're just back
from our exercise, and the exercise was to

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.790
create an object using bracketed dot
notation that represents the characters.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.040
And whatever related data you
may find in the game of Clue.

4
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.130
So what's the first thing I need to do?

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.120
Who wants to go first?

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.180
How about, someone in the middle?

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.270
You might want to volunteer themselves.

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.430
Very first thing is
always the easiest one.

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.420
Okay, so very first thing.

10
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have
to make an empty object.

11
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.465
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, but
what's the first thing I need to type?

12
00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:35.983
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: var.

13
00:00:35.983 --> 00:00:40.943
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We initialize that as

14
00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:44.300
object, literal, put a semicolon in there.

15
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.710
What's the very next
thing that we should do?

16
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Define a property?

17
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.688
So, do it like game.murder, equals,

18
00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:02.900
quotations, question mark.

19
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.510
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I like it, a mystery.

20
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.480
What's the next thing?

21
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.860
Flannel shirt.

22
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Another property for
weapons.

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.290
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Weapons.

24
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.700
How do we do that without dot notation?

25
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.090
Like this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You could do it with a value

26
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.630
dated string.

27
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.161
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, okay
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I

28
00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:42.924
made an array of-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome.

29
00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:45.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Of gun and-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Stuff like that.

30
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Of tank.

31
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

32
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.930
Laser beams, oops,
that's now how you spell laser.

33
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.374
Lasers, angry cats,

34
00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.654
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

35
00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:06.041
should I put Monster energy drink in here?

36
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:09.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome,

37
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.230
so this is cool.

38
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.690
Why would we choose
an array versus an object?

39
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.380
In this case, we haven't talked too much
about when we choose one or the other.

40
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.447
I'm assuming that you guys have
all used objects and arrays, and

41
00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:25.924
had to make that decision, over which
data structure you're gonna use.

42
00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:32.697
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it just easier to

43
00:02:32.697 --> 00:02:34.880
store a lot more data inside of an array?

44
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.090
Is that
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Size doesn't

45
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.720
really matter.

46
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.370
It's more about the structure
of the data here.

47
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.035
Since this is a collection of things
that are the same, essentially.

48
00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:53.007
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, basically it's
because it's a collection of things that

49
00:02:53.007 --> 00:02:54.950
are saying we're all weapons.

50
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.440
So it’s just like a list of
weapons versus an object.

51
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.480
It’s more like a document you can
think of it, like, it’s more of a,

52
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.130
you can make bigger things with it and
have more properties.

53
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.440
But you can also make an array
of objects and things like that.

54
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.530
So you can combine them.

55
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.600
So if I was going to make an array of
objects here, how might I do that?

56
00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.670
Let me just break this
out into lines here.

57
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.930
Just so we have space, so

58
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.130
an object has a key and a value, right?

59
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.240
So what could be the key here?

60
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Weapon one, weapon two.

61
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.170
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, well, the thing
is we have indexes, and so we can

62
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.150
line up anything that has a number like
that, we'll just refer to as the index.

63
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.114
So weapon one or
zero would be lasers, etc.

64
00:03:58.114 --> 00:04:03.897
Two would be dish soap, very deadly.

65
00:04:07.204 --> 00:04:11.901
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
what would be a property name?

66
00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:16.970
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You can call
a property name also a key.

67
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.210
Just so you know, that's the same thing.

68
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.287
Property name, all right,
how about who was next in the list?

69
00:04:26.287 --> 00:04:29.120
How about Fred in the way back?

70
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You could do,
well you'd have to have maybe lasers,

71
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.270
and the location that the lasers are at.

72
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.960
So you would do the lasers: And
then the string of like founding the lab.

73
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
that's interesting.

74
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.030
You could do that, that's valid but
I would recommend having a property name,

75
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.530
that is consistent among your objects.

76
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.645
So, for example,

77
00:05:01.645 --> 00:05:07.681
I would say to do maybe type lasers and

78
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:11.400
then location, lab.

79
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.280
Do you guys see the difference there?

80
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.460
Cuz now each of these data structures
has a type, it has a location.

81
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.300
We can organize our data around that,

82
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.830
versus having to know what the property
name is for a specific thing, every time.

83
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.980
So if the property name was lasers, and
here was angry cats, we may have to

84
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.450
remember that, whereas weapon set type and
it returns lasers, awesome.

85
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:39.335
We don't have to remember the specific
string that's stored there,

86
00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:40.919
and this is a pattern.

87
00:05:47.716 --> 00:05:50.159
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Etc., cool.

88
00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.666
What else might we have in our game?

89
00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:58.239
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You guys know
where the rest of this is, right?

90
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.370
It would be the same pattern.

91
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:01.668
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The characters name.

92
00:06:01.668 --> 00:06:05.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Characters name?

93
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Name of the game.

94
00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.300
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Name of the game?

95
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No.

96
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.760
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The characters.

97
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.950
How would I do that?

98
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:18.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The way I did, I did.

99
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.780
It should be game.name, and

100
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:26.880
then I pass an array with
different names saved as a string.

101
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.107
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,
so someone know a name

102
00:06:33.107 --> 00:06:37.179
of a character of Clue?

103
00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:39.134
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Miss Scarlet.

104
00:06:39.134 --> 00:06:43.241
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Miss Scarlet,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, and

105
00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:46.575
brown sweater, I'm sorry,
I don't know your names.

106
00:06:46.575 --> 00:06:49.650
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well actually my

107
00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.655
question is a little bit different, sorry.

108
00:06:51.655 --> 00:06:53.098
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How would we add

109
00:06:53.098 --> 00:06:55.629
Miss Scarlet to that array?

110
00:06:58.657 --> 00:07:01.430
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Without just putting
it in there in an array literal.

111
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.280
So this is array literal.

112
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.040
Where we just pop it in there.

113
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.670
But we want to add it later,
add it dynamically.

114
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do a bracket notation?

115
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure,
tell me exactly what to type.

116
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.250
Pretend like I'm like,
what's that drag in dictation software?

117
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:25.214
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know but,
game.name, bracket 0.

118
00:07:28.028 --> 00:07:34.987
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Oops,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nice, perfect.

119
00:07:34.987 --> 00:07:40.550
I do want it,
is anyone here anti-semicolon?

120
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.270
Okay, just wondering if we
could still be friends.

121
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:46.770
Just kidding,
I don’t engage in those silly things.

122
00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.460
But I do use semicolons, awesome.

123
00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or push.

124
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.230
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, we can use push.

125
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.694
What does push do?

126
00:07:57.694 --> 00:08:00.505
In the green sweatshirt.

127
00:08:00.505 --> 00:08:01.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It puts it
at the front of the array?

128
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:05.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It puts it at
the back of the array, but yeah.

129
00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:16.646
So then an array would lok something like
this, Ms. Scarlett, and then Mr. Green.

130
00:08:18.812 --> 00:08:21.214
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or does it?

131
00:08:21.214 --> 00:08:22.523
Can someone tell me
what's wrong with this?

132
00:08:28.077 --> 00:08:31.206
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How
about black sweatshirt?

133
00:08:31.206 --> 00:08:32.558
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Me?

134
00:08:32.558 --> 00:08:33.661
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

135
00:08:33.661 --> 00:08:35.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's wrong with the array?

136
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.790
Mm-hm, what's wrong?

137
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:41.185
So we just added, we used the push method.

138
00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:43.760
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
And they're saying we want it to look like

139
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.044
this, and now I'm hinting that
maybe there's something wrong.

140
00:08:46.044 --> 00:08:50.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We already have Mr.
Green there.

141
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.360
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well this is just-
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

142
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.410
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This is not real.

143
00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:59.070
This is what we want, and
I'm hinting that maybe this line is wrong.

144
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How did
we add Miss Scarlet before?

145
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:09.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: With a bracket.

146
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.458
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But
what's the difference line 14 and 15?

147
00:09:12.458 --> 00:09:14.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The blank-out.

148
00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When I'm put on the spot.

149
00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:15.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

150
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:18.597
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The half-circles, there.

151
00:09:18.597 --> 00:09:22.010
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah,
so this is a method, absolutely.

152
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.790
What about this part?

153
00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The name property.

154
00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we are pushing it to the game.

155
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.570
Which is an object.

156
00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.030
So we can't push things to an object.

157
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.510
We can only push things to an array.

158
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.640
So we need to get to,
that point was we just need a reference,

159
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:42.800
the next nested property.

160
00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:48.210
Cool, so now we're gonna move on,
unless we have any questions,

161
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:50.690
to nested properties.

162
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.240
What's up?

163
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.805
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just little, circle back
from the previous, before the break.

164
00:09:54.805 --> 00:09:55.560
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm?

165
00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:00.055
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we were to assign game,
as a array?

166
00:10:00.055 --> 00:10:01.720
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

167
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So then you would
still work as an array of object?

168
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
are you saying if we just did this?

169
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

170
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:13.080
everything will work exactly the same.
