00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.750
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
just a quick recap.

2
00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:05.010
So here are the rules for
the people who like lists of things.

3
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.595
So when can you use a dot?

4
00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:07.187
When it's a string.

5
00:00:07.187 --> 00:00:12.320
When it's a string and
it's a valid character.

6
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.910
So it can't be a number, it can't have
quotes around it, no weird characters and

7
00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.610
no expressions.

8
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.304
Expressions are things like 2 + 2,
things like that.

9
00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:23.707
So with brackets, really,
you can use brackets all the time.

10
00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:25.977
You can use them with strings,
numbers, variables, weird characters,

11
00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:26.860
and expressions.

12
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.990
So why in the world would we use dots?

13
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.150
Why does that even exist?

14
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.750
Anyone have a guess?

15
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.860
Forgot where we left off.

16
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.330
Over here, light grey sweatshirt, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why

17
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.294
would we use dots?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

18
00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:49.157
why would we ever use dots if we
can always just use the bracket?

19
00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:51.320
Seems like it covers all the cases,
you don't have to think too hard.

20
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.017
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Less characters.

21
00:00:53.017 --> 00:00:53.787
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, that's

22
00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:54.830
exactly right.

23
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.133
We do things just to save characters.

24
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.247
And you'll see that when we get to,
actually, in just, I think,

25
00:01:01.247 --> 00:01:04.491
the next slide,
when we talk about destructuring.

26
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:06.800
We like to type less.

27
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.462
Because if you're typing these things
all day, every day, over and over and

28
00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:15.420
over again, a few characters could
turn into a lot of saved time.

29
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.157
However, it doesn't always work.

30
00:01:18.157 --> 00:01:22.008
So as you're speedily typing through
all of your property definitions,

31
00:01:22.008 --> 00:01:23.510
just keep in mind the rules.

32
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.180
Awesome, so here's a recap.

33
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.302
Of course, my thing is all weird.

34
00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:37.240
I'm gonna skip the recap, but
this is here for you to quiz yourself.

35
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.836
So a learning technique that I like
to share with people is as you're

36
00:01:40.836 --> 00:01:43.551
going through a course,
instead of taking notes,

37
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:47.355
write a study guide for yourself, so
that you can quiz yourself later.

38
00:01:47.355 --> 00:01:50.936
And so this is an example of that,
this recap, so some things is like,

39
00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:52.354
what is an object, right?

40
00:01:52.354 --> 00:01:54.060
What is the difference between dot and
bracket notation?

41
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.670
I'm not gonna go over them cuz
we've been going through them.

42
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.390
But I recommend taking notes like this,
if you're a notetaker.

43
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.820
And then, on your way home, or

44
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.080
whatever, whenever you have a free moment,
just go through them.

45
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.210
Quiz yourself, and
then you can see what's sticking.

46
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.360
And then you can find patterns
in what is working for

47
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.360
you, what teaching styles work for you.

48
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.750
What frequency or repetition do
you need to learn something new?

49
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.450
Things like that.

50
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.216
So there's also apps for this.

51
00:02:26.216 --> 00:02:29.507
Have you heard of Anki?

52
00:02:29.507 --> 00:02:31.479
It's flash card kinda apps?

53
00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:36.523
I would just look for
flash card apps if you wanna invest in

54
00:02:36.523 --> 00:02:43.157
the technological piece, but usually
I'm kind of a pen and paper person.

55
00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:45.450
Awesome.

56
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.870
Does anyone do this already
when they take notes, no?

57
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.000
Worth a try.
