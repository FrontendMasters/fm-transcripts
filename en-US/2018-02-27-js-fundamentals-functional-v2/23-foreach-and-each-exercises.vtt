00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.683
So for the exercise,

2
00:00:01.683 --> 00:00:07.550
we're gonna first start by implementing
the internals of an each function, right?

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:13.710
So, just remember that each takes two
arguments, a list, and a call back.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.822
It's gonna iterate through,
each item in that list and

5
00:00:18.822 --> 00:00:24.500
call back with the values in that list,
one at a time, right?

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.390
So if we have a list of length 3,
it's gonna to call the callback 3 times,

7
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.340
each with one of those values.

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.520
Also underscore each works for
both arrays and objects.

9
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.560
So that's something to consider.

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.229
Once you finish,
you can test it by running it by using it

11
00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:50.271
with the exercise from
the previous module where we

12
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:57.390
loop through our suspects lists and
create a suspect objects.

13
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.212
So, good luck, also don't forget
that this is a little tricky here is

14
00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:05.168
that the underscore is gonna be an object.
