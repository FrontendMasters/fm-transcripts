&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So for the exercise,

2
00:00:01.615 --> 00:00:07.378
we're gonna first start by implementing
the internals of an each function, right?

3
00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:13.670
So, just remember that e ach takes two
arguments, a list, and a callback.

4
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.120
It's going to iterate through
each item in that list and

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:24.500
call that callback with the values
in that list, one at a time, right?

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.620
So if we have a list of like three,

7
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.356
it's gonna call the callback three
times each with one of those values.

8
00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:38.560
Also, _ .each works for both arrays and
objects, so that's something to consider.

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.900
Once you finish, you can test it by using

10
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.480
it with the exercise
from the previous module.

11
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.390
Where we look through our suspects
list and created suspect objects.

12
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.166
So good luck.

13
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:03.280
Also don't forget that,
this is a little tricky here,

14
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.808
is that the underscore
is gonna be an object.
