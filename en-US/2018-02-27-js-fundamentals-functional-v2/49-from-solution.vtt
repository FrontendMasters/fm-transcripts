00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.170
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone
really stoked to share

2
00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.230
what they did?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.870
it's basically what we just saw earlier,
right?

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.670
So we need to have a temporary, or

5
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.958
just return a slice.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

6
00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:19.041
return Array.prototype.slice of
what the array-like object that we

7
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:24.714
passed to it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,

8
00:00:24.714 --> 00:00:29.866
great, there you have it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone do it

9
00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:35.731
differently?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No,

10
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:39.400
you did?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just used h [INAUDIBLE].

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.037
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, okay.

12
00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:41.557
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,

13
00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:46.240
I was under the impression that
we weren't supposed to use those

14
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.021
other the prototype.slice.call,
or the .from from ef6 so-

15
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:51.899
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, well,

16
00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.565
you can't use .from because
that would be defining it with

17
00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:57.580
a definition.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Right.

18
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, either way.

19
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.470
Either way, cool, awesome.

20
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.470
So, and just one reminder that
functions are also objects, and

21
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.600
you can add properties to them.

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.780
So when you see functions like .call and

23
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.540
things like that, that is because
functions are also objects.

24
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.650
So just know that .prototype,

25
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.590
things like that, those are just
properties on this object, a special kind

26
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.882
of object that's a function.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Was anybody's mind blown?

27
00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:32.988
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] [NOISE]

28
00:01:32.988 --> 00:01:33.558
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Functions

29
00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:34.620
are objects.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
