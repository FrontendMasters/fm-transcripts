00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.471
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Usually in my workshop I spend
a lot of time talking about how to learn,

2
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.532
how to succeed.

3
00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:07.844
I kind of cut it short this time.

4
00:00:07.844 --> 00:00:13.261
I have my old videos if you wanna learn
all about my opinions about learning to

5
00:00:13.261 --> 00:00:19.291
code, how to succeed as a learner, how to
succeed as an engineer, stuff like that.

6
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:25.624
You can reference my other ones, but
some main tips but I still wanna say are,

7
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:31.390
if it feels uncomfortable as
the difficulty ramps up, that's good.

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.250
That's where you wanna be.

9
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.190
Some people,
when it starts to get difficult,

10
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.390
they think I am not ready for this.

11
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.360
My advice is just to stick with it and
see what happens.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.790
You might be surprised that eventually
there'll be an aha moment or

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.850
you will figure out what
your question really is.

14
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.800
I think that's a big part of being lost
is you don't really know what your

15
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.220
question is.

16
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.060
If you did, then you could ask it,
and then you would be fine.

17
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.670
But digging in to really where your
mental model is differing from

18
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.620
how it actually works, how your code
executes or whatever it might be.

19
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.320
It might be uncomfortable, maybe not.

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.029
Stick with it, see what happens.

21
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.610
You're here to learn,
you're here to be challenged, so

22
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.370
expect those things to happen.

23
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.590
Take responsibility for your learning,
this is huge I think, because

24
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.895
a lot of people make excuses for
things, right?

25
00:01:22.895 --> 00:01:31.920
I don't understand that because I'm
not good at math, whatever it may be.

26
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.234
So, I would like to challenge
you to put excuses to the side,

27
00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:41.226
whatever stories you have about
your skill set, or your experience,

28
00:01:41.226 --> 00:01:45.900
or whatever, and just like really
focus and try to let it soak in.

29
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.900
And try to figure out what
your barriers are though,

30
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.770
they're like really what
your questions are again.

31
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.960
And don't make excuses,
figure out what's missing for

32
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.750
you and figure out how to
measure you're learning, right?

33
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.094
How do you know that you're learning?

34
00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:11.910
It is different for everyone, so
I would just think about that and yeah.

35
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.740
And consider the questions that I'm
asking you throughout the course because

36
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.290
they're intentional.

37
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.260
So they're meant to lead
you on through a thought

38
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.620
process to help you mold
your understanding, right.

39
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.800
So when I ask you a question and
you answer it.

40
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.105
If you answer it wrong that's great
because then that's an opportunity to

41
00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:38.280
re-mold your understanding of a concept.

42
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.010
Yeah, otherwise if you're just kind
of listening along passively like

43
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.740
a lot of people would if this
was like college course, or

44
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.140
something like that,
you miss those opportunities to do that.

45
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.890
And especially in a live course,
a lot of people watch this online later.

46
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.460
They don't have as much
opportunities to do stuff like that.

47
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.560
So I would take advantage of it.

48
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.620
Anyone here feel like they're a really
good learner, they know how to learn?

49
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.950
What makes you a really good learner?

50
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Doing.

51
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.740
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Doing practicing?

52
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, not just reading or
watching or writing.

53
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.310
It's actually doing it and
trying to get it to work.

54
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.770
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yeah, absolutely I agree.

55
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.674
I agree.

56
00:03:20.674 --> 00:03:24.570
Yeah, that's one of my tips that I
usually say is don't read too much.

57
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.180
It seems like its productive, but

58
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.430
if you're trying to learn a skill
that requires you to solve problems,

59
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.486
it's not always as
productive as it may feel.

60
00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:42.730
Also reading in bed feels
like a good thing but

61
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.610
half time, I don't know if anything
like me I'm like half falling asleep.

62
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.232
I read a paragraph,
especially if it's a technical book,

63
00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:53.736
it doesn't really work for me.

64
00:03:53.736 --> 00:03:56.699
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a really
good book online so they say,

65
00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.080
it's called The Obstacle is the Way.

66
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.704
I don't know if anybody's heard of that,
but it's by Ryan Holiday and

67
00:04:01.704 --> 00:04:06.562
it's a really good book, it talks about,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That space

68
00:04:06.562 --> 00:04:09.961
where things become challenging is
actually the space you wanna be in,

69
00:04:09.961 --> 00:04:11.910
kinda like what you were talking about.

70
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.464
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And it says that that's

71
00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:15.600
where you grow if you're in that space.

72
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.982
It's pretty good.

73
00:04:16.982 --> 00:04:17.907
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

74
00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:19.781
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Thank you, sure, I like that.

75
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:20.470
Anyone else?

76
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.904
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What helps me
learn is teaching other people,

77
00:04:26.904 --> 00:04:30.557
explaining how you learned it and
what it is.

78
00:04:30.557 --> 00:04:32.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yeah, absolutely, cool.
