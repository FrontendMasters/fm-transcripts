WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.365
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna move
forward with a similar idea of going

2
00:00:03.365 --> 00:00:05.737
through lists and transforming them.

3
00:00:05.737 --> 00:00:07.024
We are gonna through in a function now.

4
00:00:07.024 --> 00:00:13.740
So this function is called
CreateSuspectObjects.

5
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:14.820
And what does it return?

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.640
Who feels like they've been neglected?

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.564
Avoid my eye contact
if you feel neglected.

8
00:00:26.564 --> 00:00:29.451
[LAUGH] That's forcing you to
actually look at me, that's so funny.

9
00:00:33.312 --> 00:00:36.099
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What about,
I feel like we chat a lot, but

10
00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:42.150
maybe I don't call on you as much, so
maybe you guys are neglected over here.

11
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.207
What does this function return?

12
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It looks like it returns
an object, but there's a lot going on.

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:56.232
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, what makes you
think that it's returning an object?

14
00:00:56.232 --> 00:00:57.104
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Honestly,

15
00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:59.124
the curly brackets-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

16
00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:01.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And the object
properties that we're looking at here.

17
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.849
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
ding ding ding, exactly.

18
00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:04.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, yeah.

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.448
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so
we're returning an object.

20
00:01:09.856 --> 00:01:11.638
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're finding some
properties on this object, right?

21
00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:13.793
We have three properties,
we have a name property.

22
00:01:13.793 --> 00:01:17.340
And this name's getting passed in, right?

23
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.860
So we have just this function and it spits
out an object, when you give it a name and

24
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.040
it figures out it's color by splitting

25
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.270
the name at the space and
getting the second one.

26
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.340
So Scarlet, Mustard, White and then it has
a speak function where it says its name.

27
00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.580
Yeah, so we have this colon

28
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.370
syntax here that's the object literal
syntax that we were looking at earlier.

29
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.740
Often on the side, right we've been
working a lot with dynamic properties

30
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.110
adding things after we
initialize the object.

31
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.010
But here's just an object
giving it to you all at once.

32
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.850
But it's the same thing.

33
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.500
The key here is that there's
some curly brackets.

34
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.160
We don't see any key words
around it like function or if or

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.220
something like that, that may make
it feel like it's something else.

36
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.790
And also, we can't return things if and
things like that, but

37
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.630
we can return functions.

38
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.810
Cool, and then,
we have an array of suspects.

39
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.510
So we have some more suspects now.

40
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.120
We have Colonel Mustard on the scene.

41
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.080
Wonder what happened to Rusty.

42
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.245
I don't know.

43
00:02:28.245 --> 00:02:32.266
So
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: can someone spot

44
00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:33.288
the difference?

45
00:02:33.288 --> 00:02:37.733
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Is it that
you called a speak immediately?

46
00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:42.123
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: There is something
different about speak, I will admit.

47
00:02:42.123 --> 00:02:45.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's a method
on the object now?

48
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.200
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
so this is a method.

49
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.670
This is an ES6 feature where
we can add methods like this,

50
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.620
no colons, just straight on there.

51
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.228
Works the same, no surprises, not
an error function or anything like that,

52
00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:02.567
just a regular function, so there you go.

53
00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:06.671
There you have some ES6, okay.

54
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:12.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Like need
the function keyword for speak.

55
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.997
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nope,
not in this case.

56
00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:20.428
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, all right.

57
00:03:20.428 --> 00:03:22.200
All right, so

58
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.410
we're initializing the empty suspects
list and, actually before I give it away.

59
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.570
What we wanna do is, we wanna
initialize each suspect into an object.

60
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.600
I call this like hydration,
like we're hydrating data into an object.

61
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.520
It's not the most,
I'm not using it very academically

62
00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.900
when I say that though like people have
opinions on what hydration is and isn't.

63
00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.950
In this case, when I say we're hydrating
an object, that means we're just taking

64
00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.630
a data, a piece of data and we're turning
it into some data structure, right?

65
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.900
And your applications, you probably
have a view model or something.

66
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.680
You guys work with view
models at work maybe, and

67
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.890
you have some data coming in or
even just a model, right?

68
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.620
You've some data coming in
either from the backend or

69
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.860
if in the case of your view model maybe
you have data coming in from a user.

70
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.870
Who knows?

71
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.980
And to me, I would say that when we take
that data and we turn it into an object or

72
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.950
like a class, that's like hydrating it.

73
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.740
Does anyone else?

74
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.830
I hear some people use it like that, but

75
00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.279
I also hear people using it
in a lot of different ways.

76
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.460
Does that make sense?

77
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.880
Have you guys taken data and
turned it into a class or an object?

78
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.910
Yeah, can I just see if that's
something people have done?

79
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.560
Okay, okay.

80
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.570
Cool.

81
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:53.400
So that's what we're going to do here.

82
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.630
So this function is kind of like a class.

83
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.020
In JavaScript, classes really are just
functions that return objects.

84
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.760
So this is really a class

85
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.120
in as much as using the keyword new or
whatever is a class,

86
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.570
except in this case we don't have
to worry about the keyword this.

87
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.740
Who really understands the keyword this?

88
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.590
I do, cuz I teach it,
but most people don't.

89
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.640
So we're not doing that today,

90
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.890
because that just a whole other
tangent that I would love to get in.

91
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.980
I think I actually have in one
of my courses, actually I think

92
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.470
in data structures and algorithms course,
if you wanna learn about the keyword this.

93
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:38.320
That's one of the very first, I do
an object oriented programming piece and

94
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.520
you can look into that and
look at the different styles.

95
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.440
Anyway, so we're gonna hydrate this list.

96
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.811
What do we do?
So we have the suspectslist, which needs

97
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:54.960
to be a list of objects created from
the create suspect objects function.

98
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.010
Are you guys following me here?

99
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.590
I'm saying suspects a lot and
it is very difficult.

100
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.360
So we want Miss Scarlet to have a function

101
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.970
with a name property that
says Miss Scarlet, right?

102
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.170
When we say Miss Scarlet.speak,
I want it to say,

103
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:14.900
my name is Miss Scarlet,
that kind of thing, yeah?

104
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.590
We're good?

105
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.050
Okay, what do we do?

106
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.420
How do we do it?

107
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.390
Do we use destructuring here?

108
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.890
No, I'm just kidding.

109
00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:28.940
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What do we do?

110
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.075
How about this corner?

111
00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.645
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cameron's like,
don't look at me.

112
00:06:37.645 --> 00:06:40.890
[LAUGH] Christina?

113
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.800
Could just take a stab at it.

114
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.085
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well, if you said
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Miss Scarlet

115
00:06:53.898 --> 00:06:59.719
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: .speak, it should.

116
00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:06.343
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah we will need it,
initialize it first.

117
00:07:09.226 --> 00:07:12.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
basically, what needs to happen,

118
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:17.932
is we need to pass this
string to this function, so

119
00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:22.640
that we have an object
that has Miss Scarlet with

120
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.653
the name that should say Scarlet, etc.

121
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:36.498
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That make sense?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: CreateSuspectsObjects,

122
00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:41.168
you mean calling the function?

123
00:07:41.168 --> 00:07:41.979
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay, great.

124
00:07:41.979 --> 00:07:45.422
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we'll do CreateSuspectObjects.

125
00:07:50.822 --> 00:07:51.606
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then what?

126
00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:57.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And then,
the name, Miss Scarlet.

127
00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.940
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But
let's get it out of our suspects.

128
00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:00.527
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

129
00:08:00.527 --> 00:08:02.438
Okay, it's 0, yeah.

130
00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:05.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Something like that.
Yeah, so we call it like that.

131
00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.439
Of course, this isn't gonna work.

132
00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:19.563
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, do I have

133
00:08:19.563 --> 00:08:23.693
any typos?

134
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Naming split still says one.

135
00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It should say one,
I think.

136
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Well for zero and one.

137
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.300
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.
Is it gonna work?

138
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:38.140
Is it gonna explode?

139
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:39.801
Ahh.

140
00:08:41.338 --> 00:08:42.500
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: There we are.

141
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.229
There's our hydrated
object with Miss Scarlet.

142
00:08:45.229 --> 00:08:47.319
Cool.

143
00:08:47.319 --> 00:08:48.988
Straight forward.

144
00:08:48.988 --> 00:08:54.391
Awesome.

145
00:08:54.391 --> 00:09:01.623
So we can loop through our list and,
I kinda messed up my indentation,

146
00:09:01.623 --> 00:09:05.922
but we can look through our list, right?

147
00:09:05.922 --> 00:09:09.476
So we start at 0, we go all the way
up to the length of the suspects,

148
00:09:09.476 --> 00:09:11.265
we increment each time, right?

149
00:09:11.265 --> 00:09:14.008
That's what this says.

150
00:09:14.008 --> 00:09:20.486
And we're gonna assign a suspect, right?

151
00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:22.104
Maybe you wanna say let here, right?

152
00:09:22.104 --> 00:09:25.897
Cuz we're gonna reassign it
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

153
00:09:25.897 --> 00:09:32.070
we're gonna pass CreateSuspectsObjects,
suspects at one or sorry at I.

154
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.053
Then we're gonna push suspect
into the suspectsList.

155
00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:41.330
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Seem fair?

156
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:46.660
So we're looping through a collection,
hydrating it, creating instances of these

157
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.430
objects, suspect objects.

158
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.600
Cool.

159
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.065
Have you guys done this
kinda thing before?

160
00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:58.000
Yeah, okay.

161
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.680
Cool.

162
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:00.330
Here's that with the last line.

163
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.340
Combined, so

164
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.010
we just say CreateSuspectsObjects,
suspects at i and put that inside a push.
