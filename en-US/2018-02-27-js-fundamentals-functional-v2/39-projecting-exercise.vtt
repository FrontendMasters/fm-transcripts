00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.370
&gt;&gt; Bianca: So we're gonna do something
called projecting, which is basically when

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:11.880
you take a value out of a data structure
and turn it into another data structure.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.910
It's just a fancy name for
that you might find in

4
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.710
functional programming libraries or
literature.

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.430
But basically all we wanna do is, we're
gonna reference this data structure here.

6
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.170
&gt;&gt; Bianca: And you could actually
do it in the jspin if you want.

7
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.360
But I just put it in here so
that you can copy it.

8
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that the same
one we were using earlier?

9
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.346
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Is it the same one?

10
00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:39.713
Yes, it is.

11
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.036
&gt;&gt; Bianca: So, before we filtered it,
and then we wanna map it into

12
00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:54.652
an array of strings so
we filtered it into an array of objects,

13
00:00:54.652 --> 00:00:58.648
now we wanna map it into
an array of strings so

14
00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:05.790
the output should look something like
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Something like this.

15
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Right?

16
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:16.814
So just building on the previous exercise.
