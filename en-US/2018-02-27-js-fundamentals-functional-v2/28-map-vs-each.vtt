00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
now we understand how to implement it.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.640
I couldn't find a free version
of a broken pipe, of all things,

3
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.830
so there's [LAUGH] my stock photo.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.640
So yeah, here's our broken weapons.

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:17.930
We have a list of broken stuff, cool?

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:18.917
So we transformed our list.

7
00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:28.281
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome, so
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Here's

8
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:32.643
our example from before where we have our,
and I do have a typo here.

9
00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:47.360
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
where were we, okay.

10
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.350
So we're mapping through our suspects,
right?

11
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.870
Remember before this was a suspects list,
and we just had an array.

12
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.770
We were looping and pushing it.

13
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.774
Now we don't have to do that.

14
00:00:58.774 --> 00:01:02.910
We'll just map through our suspects for
each name.

15
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.910
We'll create an object and
we'll return it.

16
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.237
And it will create a suspects list.

17
00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:15.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone
wanna see this in action?

18
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.145
Yeah or no?

19
00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:19.037
Yeah, okay.

20
00:01:25.087 --> 00:01:27.194
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

21
00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:36.323
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?

22
00:01:40.388 --> 00:01:44.242
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So this is a more
realistic application of map, right?

23
00:01:44.242 --> 00:01:51.270
Rather than concatenating strings,
we're creating objects and returning them.

24
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.673
And then we can each through them and
call each one.

25
00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:08.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Suspect.speak?

26
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.467
Cuz we need suspectsList.

27
00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:15.903
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What is it?

28
00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:20.336
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's cuz of your
log instead of console dot.

29
00:02:20.336 --> 00:02:26.011
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, well,
you guys get the gist, right?

30
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.930
The gist is life is hard.

31
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.920
Editing Chrome tools is hard.

32
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.493
Okay, so here's another version of that

33
00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:44.758
just with the each from before to compare.
