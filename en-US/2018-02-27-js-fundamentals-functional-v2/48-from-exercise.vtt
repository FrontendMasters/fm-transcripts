1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.390
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, yeah,
so we're gonna implement this.

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:07.875
In this case, we're gonna pass the array.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just so

3
00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.497
you know.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And we're gonna

4
00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:17.394
implement the internals of from.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

5
00:00:17.394 --> 00:00:20.970
then we'll do that, we'll eat lunch, and

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
we'll come back in an hour,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or so.

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.708
You have a question?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Yeah, so

8
00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:32.127
the array-like object that it's receiving,
could you just say

9
00:00:32.127 --> 00:00:37.757
more about what that is supposed to be,
at least for this exercise?

10
00:00:37.757 --> 00:00:39.070
Should it
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: They should

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.870
return an array.

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.124
It should take an array-like object and
return an array.

13
00:00:43.124 --> 00:00:49.380
An array-like object is just
an object that has numerical indices,

14
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.380
but it doesn't have array methods on it.
&gt;&gt; off screen: Okay.

15
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.670
Okay, I think I see what you mean then.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, it

16
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.557
actually even has a length, so be careful.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But

17
00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:02.310
it won't have a push.
&gt;&gt; off screen: Okay.

18
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.718
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's what it would

19
00:01:05.718 --> 00:01:06.990
look like visually.

20
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.462
That's a good question.
&gt;&gt; off screen: Okay, got it, thank you.

21
00:01:09.462 --> 00:01:11.494
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

22
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.449
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And if you do, well,

23
00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:25.017
let's try something here, I'm curious.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

24
00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.510
I'll show you a cool trick.

25
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.810
You ready?

26
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.100
So did you know that you could
just put a debugger here?

27
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.844
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Did you guys

28
00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.590
know that?

29
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.434
And then you run it, and
it just opens your random code snippet in

30
00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:44.434
the debugger?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

31
00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:48.478
I put a debugger here, because I wanna
stop the function right there, so

32
00:01:48.478 --> 00:01:51.150
I can have access to arguments.

33
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.370
And why did I wanna do that again?

34
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.744
Now I'm totally blanking
what I was about to do.

35
00:01:54.744 --> 00:01:59.108
What were we just talking about?

36
00:01:59.108 --> 00:02:03.209
So here's what the arguments,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Looks like, and

37
00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.667
if we say Array.isArray,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: (arguments),

38
00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.120
should return false.

39
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.560
Can you guys see that?

40
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.004
It's a little small.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So all I did was,

41
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:20.290
I took a code snippet, I put
a debugger in there, it pauses it here.

42
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.670
And the reason I wanna pause it there is
cuz it's after it's been invoked, and

43
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.031
the argument's,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Variable has a value

44
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:29.980
at that point.

45
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.500
So, if you wanna
experiment with your code,

46
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.461
you can do that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And, for

47
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:43.038
those of you who aren't
familiar with how this works,

48
00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:47.720
you can step over your code as well,
and you can also step into methods.

49
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.600
So, if you define a method, you can
step into it, and it will jump into

50
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.730
that file or to that method definition,
and then you can keep walking through.

51
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.070
And you can follow how
your code runs in your,

52
00:03:01.032 --> 00:03:02.449
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Project.

53
00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:07.790
So, that's kind of nice, and if you go
too far in, you can step out as well.

54
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.520
But most of the time,
I'm just stepping over things.

55
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.600
And then it will tell me, for
example, that array looks

56
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.580
like that, and I can hover,
which is pretty nice.

57
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.700
Also, if I go too far,
I can look at the call stack, and

58
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.260
I can do something called
restart stack frame.

59
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.212
And it will go back to the beginning, and
then I can do it again, and just be like,

60
00:03:31.212 --> 00:03:32.660
wait, what happened?

61
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.752
Okay, that's what happened.

62
00:03:33.752 --> 00:03:36.342
And then I forgot again,
and I restart it, or

63
00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:40.106
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's another

64
00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:41.040
cool thing.

65
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.420
You can watch variables if you want,

66
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.680
it's not as useful as it used
to be now that we can hover, and

67
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.541
it has these little orange things now.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You can see

68
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.980
different scopes, which will be useful,
after lunch, we're gonna talk about scope.

69
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.440
So, in our global scope,

70
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.815
it looks like we have a lot of different,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Libraries

71
00:04:04.815 --> 00:04:11.211
here with a bunch of craziness.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then locally,

72
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:17.032
we have our arguments array in the window.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'm not sure,

73
00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:22.760
I guess the script scope is just the scope
of this little snippet that I passed in.
