>> Bianca Gandolfo: Let's use it, we have an array of weapons. We have a candlestick, a lead pipe and a revolver. We also have this function called makeBroken. What it does is it takes and item returns a broken item by prepending it with the word broken. So, what we want to do is we want an array of broken weapons.

[00:00:33]
We're pacifists here, okay? We make functions that break them. How might we do that? Let's take five minutes to do that. One tip is that, I don't think there's underscore here. There's kombuches here, do you guys see this?
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What is that? Does anyone know what that is?

[00:01:11]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: That is funny.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Hm. Something's tracking me. Okay. So, looks like we don't have a underscore, we have some other things. So, if you want to use _map, what I do, and I also do this with jQuery if I wanna just test something really quick, is I just go the _js website.

[00:01:39]
We don't wanna go to the docs, cuz then you can see it, and you just open it, and it'll have it. So, that's a tip. You can just come here if you don't wanna set up the library and all that, if you don't already have it you can do that.

[00:01:55]
And most libraries will let you do this. So jQuery, you can see,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know anyway, it's there.
>> Off screen: What are you looking for?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Nothing, I was just showing them that they can access the jQuery library. By just going to the jQuery website and playing in the console.

[00:02:25]
Just as like a quick and dirty, I wanna see something, really how it works. Okay, So, you guys got your task. We're gonna take these weapons. We're gonna make them broken by mapping over them.
