00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.500
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: In conclusion,
I just made this slide for

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.140
people who try to cheat.

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.490
So before we reveal the big reveal,

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.970
I wanna talk a little bit more about next
steps, and how to apply these skills.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.250
So what we did over the past
couple of days is we

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.500
learned how to implement
functional utility methods.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.470
Maybe some of you had used
them before at work or

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.950
saw them around in documentation for
various frameworks.

9
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.152
But most people haven't had a chance
to take the time and implement them.

10
00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:35.190
And so we didn't,

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.140
we implemented them and we learned
a lot along the way around scope,

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.490
functions, objects, arrays, all of
the core fundamentals of JavaScript.

13
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.484
We did it in ES5, and
we applied some ES6 concepts on top

14
00:00:50.484 --> 00:00:54.868
of it just to bring it up
to a more modern standard.

15
00:00:54.868 --> 00:00:57.352
And as far as next steps I recommend,

16
00:00:57.352 --> 00:01:01.937
if you'd really like to learn more
about functional programming.

17
00:01:01.937 --> 00:01:06.141
Everything you've learned in the past
couple days can be applied to a future

18
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:08.190
course in functional programming.

19
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.687
You can learn more about architecting
your code in a functional way and

20
00:01:13.687 --> 00:01:19.092
composing these different utility
methods in creative ways to write

21
00:01:19.092 --> 00:01:25.560
your code more effectively.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's about it.

22
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.600
And the murderer is, does anyone know?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.478
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No, the murderer is

24
00:01:34.478 --> 00:01:37.539
you guys cuz you killed it.
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]

25
00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.105
Aah!
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Do not edit that out.

26
00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:42.959
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] That's

27
00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:43.712
it!
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I have

28
00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:44.274
to go.

29
00:01:44.274 --> 00:01:48.056
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Cue

30
00:01:48.056 --> 00:01:49.170
the music.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

31
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.148
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: [LAUGH] Cue the music.

32
00:01:50.148 --> 00:01:51.238
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]

33
00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:51.927
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: I need the world's

34
00:01:51.927 --> 00:01:53.480
tiniest violin.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Cue the music back to life.

35
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.260
