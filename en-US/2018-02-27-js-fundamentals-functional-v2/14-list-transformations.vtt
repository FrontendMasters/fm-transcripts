00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The next thing
we're going to talk about is list

2
00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.860
transformations, which is one of the core
things that you will be doing in

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.830
functional utility methods,
which is take a list or collection of

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.550
data in different arrangements and
then, extract data from them similarly,

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.810
to how we using destructing but
also by looping through it

6
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.660
and using various logic to
get what we need from it.

7
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.560
A lot of times, especially if you're
working on the front end, you're stuck

8
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.850
with using an API, that you don't really
have any control over and the data

9
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.070
that you're getting back isn't always
in the form that you need it to be in.

10
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.022
So using these functional
utility methods to transform

11
00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:54.339
these lists into something
that is more usable or

12
00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.709
works better for how your UI is
arranged is something you have

13
00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:04.973
to do everyday Are you guy doing
that every day in your jobs or

14
00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:10.376
do you have pretty good API's,
that give you what you need?

15
00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:13.812
Anyone?
Does anyone work with JSON data at work?

16
00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we talked a little bit about nesting.

17
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.890
Here's an example from earlier

18
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.180
when we were talking about
making that game object.

19
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.135
Here we just happen to be using
the bracket notation with strings.

20
00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:36.948
All right.

21
00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:41.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
here we're pushing.

22
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.770
And this is what our
object literal looks like.

23
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.234
I like to have a visual here so
that we can kind of keep track

24
00:01:50.234 --> 00:01:54.705
of what the object looks like
as we're manipulating it.

25
00:01:54.705 --> 00:01:59.428
Okay, and so we can push,
and we can also use

26
00:01:59.428 --> 00:02:04.444
just a regular array,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Bracket

27
00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:06.090
with the number thing.

28
00:02:08.183 --> 00:02:10.136
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, awesome.

29
00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:14.252
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's
game suspects going to return?

30
00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:23.707
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How about
grey sweater the button up.

31
00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:26.398
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] Suspects.

32
00:02:26.398 --> 00:02:29.803
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,
can you see that there's a question mark,

33
00:02:29.803 --> 00:02:31.642
question mark next to it.

34
00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:40.667
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, it should,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Turn the object.

35
00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:44.968
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Which object?

36
00:02:44.968 --> 00:02:48.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The suspects object,
the collection of-

37
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.144
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Suspects array?

38
00:02:49.144 --> 00:02:50.376
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The array of the array of.

39
00:02:50.376 --> 00:02:54.056
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What do
you think it will return?

40
00:02:54.056 --> 00:02:57.426
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's what I think too,
but it's got,

41
00:03:06.631 --> 00:03:07.820
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

42
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.358
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

43
00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:09.611
What do you think, Dee?

44
00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:12.984
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Got it.

45
00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.918
What do you think?

46
00:03:14.918 --> 00:03:21.461
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It looks to me it's
gonna return that array of objects.

47
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:22.431
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

48
00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:24.835
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Name, color, name, color.

49
00:03:24.835 --> 00:03:29.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'm gonna
tell you that you're wrong.

50
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.882
Will you forgive me?

51
00:03:32.228 --> 00:03:34.218
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So unfortunately,

52
00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:39.931
we're not using our,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

53
00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:41.724
We were using our quotes so

54
00:03:41.724 --> 00:03:46.623
it wasn't going to do anything that
we wanted it to do, but now it will.

55
00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:51.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
you guys see that?

56
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.130
Tricky tricky, be careful,
I like to be a trickster.

57
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.700
Anyone see that?

58
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.678
Yeah, you guys are good for keeping quiet.

59
00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome,
so here we are.

60
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.428
It's gonna return the array with
these suspect objects in them.
