00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:05.342
Next thing we're gonna talk
about is list transformations,

2
00:00:05.342 --> 00:00:09.907
which is one of the core things
that you will be doing in

3
00:00:09.907 --> 00:00:14.371
functional utility methods
which just take a list or

4
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:18.744
a collection of data and
different arrangements.

5
00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:25.476
And then extract data from them similarly
to how we're using destructuring,

6
00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:32.412
but also by looping through it and using
various logic to get what we need from it.

7
00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:36.144
A lot of times, especially if
you're working on the front end,

8
00:00:36.144 --> 00:00:41.310
you're stuck with using an API, that
you don't really have any control over.

9
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.132
And the data that you're getting back
isn't always in the form that you

10
00:00:44.132 --> 00:00:44.800
need it to be in.

11
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.461
And so, using these functional
utility methods to transform these

12
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:55.624
lists into something that is more usable,
or works better for

13
00:00:55.624 --> 00:01:00.903
how your UI is arranged,
is something you have to do every day.

14
00:01:00.903 --> 00:01:03.790
Are you guys doing that
everyday in your jobs?

15
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.221
Or you have pretty good APIs
that give you what you need.

16
00:01:10.152 --> 00:01:11.050
Anyone?

17
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.951
Does anyone work with JSON data at work?

18
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:16.160
Yeah.

19
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.492
Cool, okay.

20
00:01:21.083 --> 00:01:23.080
So, we talked a little bit about nesting.

21
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.185
Here's an example from earlier,

22
00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:29.190
when we were talking about
making that game object.

23
00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:35.135
Here, we're just happened to be using
the bracket notation with strings.

24
00:01:35.135 --> 00:01:36.973
All right.

25
00:01:39.847 --> 00:01:43.181
Here we're pushing.

26
00:01:43.181 --> 00:01:45.770
And this is what our object
literally looks like.

27
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.216
I like to have a visual here so that we
can kind of keep track of what the object

28
00:01:49.216 --> 00:01:51.034
looks like as we're manipulating it.

29
00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:57.911
Okay, so we can push and

30
00:01:57.911 --> 00:02:02.877
we can also use just a regular array

31
00:02:02.877 --> 00:02:08.540
bracket with the number thing, okay?

32
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.620
Awesome.

33
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.160
What's game suspects gonna return?

34
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.556
How about gray sweater

35
00:02:22.556 --> 00:02:27.924
that button up
&gt;&gt; Under suspects?

36
00:02:27.924 --> 00:02:31.690
&gt;&gt; Yep, can you see that there's
a question mark next to it?

37
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.266
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it should

38
00:02:39.046 --> 00:02:42.806
Return the object.

39
00:02:42.806 --> 00:02:45.230
&gt;&gt; Which object?

40
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.660
&gt;&gt; The suspects object.

41
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.573
&gt;&gt; Suspects array.

42
00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:52.792
&gt;&gt; The array of,
&gt;&gt; What do you think?

43
00:02:54.366 --> 00:02:59.560
&gt;&gt; It looks to me like it's gonna
return that array of objects.

44
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.470
Name, color.

45
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.960
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna tell you that you're wrong.

46
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.274
Do you forgive me?

47
00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:14.160
So, unfortunately we're not using our.

48
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.590
Yeah, we're using air quotes so it wasn't
gonna do anything that we wanted it to do.

49
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.111
But now, well Yeah, you guys see that?

50
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:34.801
So, here we are, it's gonna return the
array with the suspect objects in them.
