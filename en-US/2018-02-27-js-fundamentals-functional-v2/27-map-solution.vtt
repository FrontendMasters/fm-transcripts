00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.860
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We were given
the task of taking the weapons list and

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.940
breaking them off using map.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.890
So first things first,
let's just bring up map.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.420
How do we do that?

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.872
The first thing that it's
expecting is a list, and

6
00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:22.674
the second thing is a callback function.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Weapons.

7
00:00:22.674 --> 00:00:24.481
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, weapons, and

8
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:29.580
then what's the callback function?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Function-

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.390
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, the

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.230
makeBroken one.

11
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.711
So what is this gonna return?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What if I

12
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:42.305
did this?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: An array?

13
00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:42.885
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.

14
00:00:47.106 --> 00:00:49.757
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, can we do it as array?

15
00:00:49.757 --> 00:00:50.263
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

16
00:01:00.421 --> 00:01:00.932
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Woo-hoo, so

17
00:01:00.932 --> 00:01:02.470
it's an array.

18
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:03.588
What's gonna be in the array?

19
00:01:03.588 --> 00:01:09.055
How about,

20
00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:13.440
anyone?

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.240
We're almost there.

22
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.830
We're almost to the end.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Broken candlestick,

23
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.370
broken leadpipe, and broken revolver.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.
