&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're gonna create
an object that looks something like this,

2
00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:04.330
right?

3
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.494
We have a name, a room, and a weapon.

4
00:00:06.494 --> 00:00:11.474
And we have a new character, Rusty.

5
00:00:11.474 --> 00:00:15.532
He sounds a little
suspicious if you ask me.

6
00:00:15.532 --> 00:00:18.358
And we have room in the kitchen.

7
00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:20.333
So we're gonna extract out the weapon and

8
00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.890
location using the structuring
techniques mentioned above.

9
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.050
You can use whatever keyword for
declaring your variables as you like.
