00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.730
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mrs.
White was an array this whole time?

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.130
How is that possible?

3
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.840
Any idea?

4
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.383
What is who gonna be if Mrs.
White is really an array?

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.814
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's who?

6
00:00:12.814 --> 00:00:16.416
Let's see, how about go kart sweater?

7
00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:23.939
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sorry,

8
00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.235
what's the question again?

9
00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:26.432
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
you see where it says who ??

10
00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:29.057
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep.

11
00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:31.727
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What do you think that
will evaluate to after this code is run?

12
00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.016
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mrs. White.

13
00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.256
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

14
00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:45.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

15
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.890
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah?

16
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:52.605
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is
anyone suprised by that?

17
00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:53.713
Has anyone seen this before?

18
00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:58.735
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Raise your
hand if you've seen this before.

19
00:00:58.735 --> 00:01:00.598
This looks familiar, a couple people.

20
00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:08.466
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I would argue that you
have seen this before, cuz we did talk

21
00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:13.600
about it earlier with array.push,
array.length, right?

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.230
We have properties on our arrays, yeah?

23
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.879
Do you believe me?

24
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.293
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No,
yeah, yeah, no, circle.

25
00:01:27.434 --> 00:01:29.733
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
so arrays are objects and

26
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:33.150
because of that the rules
are exactly the same.

27
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.790
And you may be thinking, but I always
see arrays doing something different,

28
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.960
there's always a number,
there's always some bracket thing,

29
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.760
we don't really use dots with arrays,
that's weird.

30
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.870
What is this crazy lady saying?

31
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.370
Well I'm here to tell you
that it's all a sham, and

32
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.870
the reason that we use brackets is

33
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.280
not because it's an array but also,
we used brackets with objects.

34
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.370
So, what do you think this
is gonna evaluate here?

35
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.310
typeof white === array.

36
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.550
Who have I not spoken to yet?

37
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.731
Maybe you, Prime sweatshirt.

38
00:02:24.683 --> 00:02:26.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sorry,
where was White assigned?

39
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.856
I don't see a,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Whoops, sorry,

40
00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:30.200
that's supposed to say person.

41
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sure.

42
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.200
I believe that would then
respond with the true.

43
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.401
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's try it.

44
00:02:44.827 --> 00:02:47.158
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'll
have to change that.

45
00:02:47.158 --> 00:02:49.303
Can you guys see this all right?

46
00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:54.183
Who thinks, so put your thumbs up if
you think this is gonna evaluate to

47
00:02:54.183 --> 00:02:59.082
true put your thumbs down if you think
this is gonna evaluate to false.

48
00:02:59.082 --> 00:03:03.258
So we have some thumbs up,
we have some thumbs down, be proud.

49
00:03:06.393 --> 00:03:11.025
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I like you're
like I don't want to show anyone.

50
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:13.665
Moment of truth, false.

51
00:03:17.767 --> 00:03:18.875
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Type of object.

52
00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:19.577
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is it an object now?

53
00:03:19.577 --> 00:03:20.477
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

54
00:03:25.633 --> 00:03:29.125
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So for most of your
JavaScript career you're surprised by

55
00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.770
this because people
have been lying to you.

56
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.486
And I'm sorry to be the person to tell
you, but people have been lying to you,

57
00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:42.180
arrays are just objects.

58
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.774
Yes, they are different a little bit,
but not fundamentally.

59
00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:51.276
The only difference between an object and
an array,

60
00:03:51.276 --> 00:03:54.627
is that the arrays have
some cool methods on them.

61
00:03:54.627 --> 00:03:56.730
Yeah, a method is just a function, right?

62
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.980
So when you say array.push, array.pop and

63
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.030
this is my symbol for the invocation,
call a function, two parentheses.

64
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.480
Does that translate?

65
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.950
I don't know if that translates
internationally, and over a screen.

66
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.690
But, so those are our methods.

67
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.410
And that's really the thing
that is different about arrays.

68
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.711
Is that length property,

69
00:04:23.711 --> 00:04:28.315
which I think is the most important part
of the array is the .length property.
