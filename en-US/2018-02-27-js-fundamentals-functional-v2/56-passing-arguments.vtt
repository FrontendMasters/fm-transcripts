00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
what about passing arguments to functions?

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.772
So here we have this increment function.

3
00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:08.935
And I apologize for this example,

4
00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:13.415
it's the most cliche example,
but here we are.

5
00:00:13.415 --> 00:00:18.082
So we have an increment function,
right, we're defining a function,

6
00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:20.157
it takes n and it returns n + 1.

7
00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:25.678
Then we have the square function,
it takes n and it returns n times n, okay?

8
00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:28.867
So this one's gonna square it,
this one's gonna increment it.

9
00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:32.232
And this is our function,
it says doMathSoIDontHaveTo.

10
00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:36.938
This function takes n and it takes
a callback function, and it returns that

11
00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:42.617
function with n passed to it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone have

12
00:00:42.617 --> 00:00:48.501
a question about what I just said?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

13
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:54.746
so, doMathSoIDontHaveTo takes n and
it takes a function.

14
00:00:54.746 --> 00:01:02.160
Returns that function with
n invoked as an argument.

15
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.200
So in this case,
doMathSoIDontHaveTo takes 5,

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.490
so n is 5, square, right,
this function as func.

17
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.097
And so this is square with 5 which equals,
25, yeah.

18
00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:25.652
[LAUGH] You guys make me laugh.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

19
00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:30.160
not interested in entertaining
me like a kindergartner.

20
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.229
So this one is doMathSoIDontHaveTo,
we pass 4, n is 4,

21
00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.854
increment, which is this
function that increments.

22
00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:46.569
Func is increment and
we return increment n,

23
00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.877
which is then?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 5.

24
00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.138
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, I was thinking

25
00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:54.385
it was 6 for some reason but it's 5.
