[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: The next thing we're going to talk about is list transformations, which is one of the core things that you will be doing in functional utility methods, which is take a list or collection of data in different arrangements and then, extract data from them similarly, to how we using destructing but also by looping through it and using various logic to get what we need from it.

[00:00:32]
A lot of times, especially if you're working on the front end, you're stuck with using an API, that you don't really have any control over and the data that you're getting back isn't always in the form that you need it to be in. So using these functional utility methods to transform these lists into something that is more usable or works better for how your UI is arranged is something you have to do everyday Are you guy doing that every day in your jobs or do you have pretty good API's, that give you what you need?

[00:01:10]
Anyone? Does anyone work with JSON data at work?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we talked a little bit about nesting. Here's an example from earlier when we were talking about making that game object. Here we just happen to be using the bracket notation with strings. All right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And here we're pushing.

[00:01:43]
And this is what our object literal looks like. I like to have a visual here so that we can kind of keep track of what the object looks like as we're manipulating it. Okay, and so we can push, and we can also use just a regular array,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Bracket with the number thing.

[00:02:08]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, awesome.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What's game suspects going to return?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: How about grey sweater the button up.
>> Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] Suspects.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, can you see that there's a question mark, question mark next to it.
>> Speaker 2: Yeah, it should,
>> Speaker 2: Return the object.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Which object?
>> Speaker 2: The suspects object, the collection of-

[00:02:48]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Suspects array?
>> Speaker 2: The array of the array of.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What do you think it will return?
>> Speaker 3: That's what I think too, but it's got,
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay. What do you think, Dee?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Got it. What do you think?
>> Speaker 4: It looks to me it's gonna return that array of objects.

[00:03:21]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 4: Name, color, name, color.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I'm gonna tell you that you're wrong. Will you forgive me?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So unfortunately, we're not using our,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah. We were using our quotes so it wasn't going to do anything that we wanted it to do, but now it will.

[00:03:49]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, you guys see that? Tricky tricky, be careful, I like to be a trickster. Anyone see that? Yeah, you guys are good for keeping quiet.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome, so here we are. It's gonna return the array with these suspect objects in them.
