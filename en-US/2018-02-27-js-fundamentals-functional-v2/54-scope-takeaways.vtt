00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:03.440
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What were your big
takeaways from that scope exercise?

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.094
Where did we leave off in
our little trailing game?

3
00:00:08.094 --> 00:00:11.752
Who did the big reveal on the last one,
13?

4
00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:14.817
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No one remembers?

5
00:00:14.817 --> 00:00:16.186
That was a big responsibility.

6
00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:20.109
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like five whole minutes ago.

7
00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:22.343
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
it was five minutes ago, you're right,

8
00:00:22.343 --> 00:00:23.930
that's way too long to remember.

9
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.457
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The ability that let can
be blocking scope, I didn't know that.

10
00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:33.031
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, that, and you
can use let and create block scope, yeah.

11
00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:41.849
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You are setting the values
as soon as you call the function again.

12
00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:42.530
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

13
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.966
creating an execution context
every time we call a function.

14
00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:50.849
A new execution context is created, which
means any variables that are initialized,

15
00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:52.138
just like in a loop, right?

16
00:00:52.138 --> 00:00:55.198
When you loop,
you leave a variable inside of a loop,

17
00:00:55.198 --> 00:00:57.383
it's going to get re-initialized.

18
00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:01.430
If you're initializing your
variable in a loop, similar idea.

19
00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:08.553
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So.

20
00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:18.193
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's talk about why
we're really here, we're trying to figure

21
00:01:18.193 --> 00:01:23.130
out who killed Mr. Body,
anything on Miss Scarlett so far?

22
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.710
So we've been going through, for
almost two days now, a lot of data.

23
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.862
Anyone have any hunches
about Miss Scarlett's

24
00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:40.635
relationship with the murder of Mr. Body?

25
00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:51.292
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Thumbs up
if you think she is not guilty.

26
00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:53.812
Thumbs down if you think she
is a cold blooded killer.

27
00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.839
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, some people
don't have opinions, there is no-

28
00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:01.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,

29
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.294
she's a viable suspect right now, right?

30
00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:05.925
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

31
00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:06.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

32
00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think we've been awfully
focused on Miss Scarlet, I mean,

33
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.561
we're kind of picking people here.

34
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:13.668
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's a red herring.

35
00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:15.482
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, a scarlet one.

36
00:02:15.482 --> 00:02:17.139
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH]
