&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Our exercise is
that we are going to use some loops.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.637
So, we're gonna take this data structure,
or you can use the data structure

3
00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:13.520
that you already created in the previous
exercise, and we're just gonna

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.348
loop through this nested array using
any kind of four loop that you like.
