[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we're just back from our exercise, and the exercise was to create an object using bracketed dot notation that represents the characters. And whatever related data you may find in the game of Clue. So what's the first thing I need to do? Who wants to go first?

[00:00:16]
How about, someone in the middle? You might want to volunteer themselves. Very first thing is always the easiest one. Okay, so very first thing.
>> Speaker 2: You have to make an empty object.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, but what's the first thing I need to type?
>> Speaker 2: var.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay
>> Bianca Gandolfo: We initialize that as object, literal, put a semicolon in there.

[00:00:47]
What's the very next thing that we should do?
>> Speaker 3: Define a property? So, do it like game.murder, equals, quotations, question mark.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I like it, a mystery. What's the next thing? Flannel shirt.
>> Speaker 2: Another property for weapons.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Weapons. How do we do that without dot notation? Like this.

[00:01:28]

>> Speaker 2: You could do it with a value dated string.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, okay
>> Speaker 2: I made an array of-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome.
>> Speaker 2: Of gun and-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Stuff like that.
>> Speaker 2: Of tank.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right. Laser beams, oops, that's now how you spell laser. Lasers, angry cats,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, should I put Monster energy drink in here?

[00:02:06]

>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome, so this is cool. Why would we choose an array versus an object? In this case, we haven't talked too much about when we choose one or the other. I'm assuming that you guys have all used objects and arrays, and had to make that decision, over which data structure you're gonna use.

[00:02:31]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 2: Is it just easier to store a lot more data inside of an array? Is that
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Size doesn't really matter. It's more about the structure of the data here. Since this is a collection of things that are the same, essentially.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, basically it's because it's a collection of things that are saying we're all weapons.

[00:02:54]
So it’s just like a list of weapons versus an object. It’s more like a document you can think of it, like, it’s more of a, you can make bigger things with it and have more properties. But you can also make an array of objects and things like that.

[00:03:11]
So you can combine them. So if I was going to make an array of objects here, how might I do that? Let me just break this out into lines here. Just so we have space, so an object has a key and a value, right? So what could be the key here?

[00:03:43]

>> Speaker 2: Weapon one, weapon two.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, well, the thing is we have indexes, and so we can line up anything that has a number like that, we'll just refer to as the index. So weapon one or zero would be lasers, etc. Two would be dish soap, very deadly.

[00:04:07]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: So what would be a property name?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You can call a property name also a key. Just so you know, that's the same thing. Property name, all right, how about who was next in the list? How about Fred in the way back?
>> Speaker 2: You could do, well you'd have to have maybe lasers, and the location that the lasers are at.

[00:04:38]
So you would do the lasers: And then the string of like founding the lab.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, that's interesting. You could do that, that's valid but I would recommend having a property name, that is consistent among your objects. So, for example, I would say to do maybe type lasers and then location, lab.

[00:05:11]
Do you guys see the difference there? Cuz now each of these data structures has a type, it has a location. We can organize our data around that, versus having to know what the property name is for a specific thing, every time. So if the property name was lasers, and here was angry cats, we may have to remember that, whereas weapon set type and it returns lasers, awesome.

[00:05:34]
We don't have to remember the specific string that's stored there, and this is a pattern.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Etc., cool. What else might we have in our game?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You guys know where the rest of this is, right? It would be the same pattern.
>> Speaker 2: The characters name.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Characters name?

[00:06:05]

>> Speaker 2: Name of the game.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Name of the game?
>> Speaker 2: No.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: The characters. How would I do that?
>> Speaker 2: The way I did, I did. It should be game.name, and then I pass an array with different names saved as a string.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so someone know a name of a character of Clue?

[00:06:37]

>> Speaker 2: Miss Scarlet.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Miss Scarlet,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right, and brown sweater, I'm sorry, I don't know your names.
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Well actually my question is a little bit different, sorry.
>> Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: How would we add Miss Scarlet to that array?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Without just putting it in there in an array literal.

[00:07:01]
So this is array literal. Where we just pop it in there. But we want to add it later, add it dynamically.
>> Speaker 2: Do a bracket notation?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Sure, tell me exactly what to type. Pretend like I'm like, what's that drag in dictation software?
>> Speaker 2: I don't know but, game.name, bracket 0.

[00:07:28]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Oops,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Nice, perfect. I do want it, is anyone here anti-semicolon? Okay, just wondering if we could still be friends. Just kidding, I don’t engage in those silly things. But I do use semicolons, awesome.
>> Speaker 2: Or push.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, we can use push. What does push do?

[00:07:57]
In the green sweatshirt.
>> Speaker 2: It puts it at the front of the array?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: It puts it at the back of the array, but yeah. So then an array would lok something like this, Ms. Scarlett, and then Mr. Green.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Or does it? Can someone tell me what's wrong with this?

[00:08:28]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: How about black sweatshirt?
>> Speaker 3: Me?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 3: What's wrong with the array? Mm-hm, what's wrong? So we just added, we used the push method.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm. And they're saying we want it to look like this, and now I'm hinting that maybe there's something wrong.
>> Speaker 3: We already have Mr. Green there.

[00:08:50]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Well this is just-
>> [INAUDIBLE]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: This is not real. This is what we want, and I'm hinting that maybe this line is wrong.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: How did we add Miss Scarlet before?
>> Speaker 3: With a bracket.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: But what's the difference line 14 and 15?
>> Speaker 3: The-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: The blank-out.

[00:09:14]

>> Speaker 3: When I'm put on the spot.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Speaker 3: The half-circles, there.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, so this is a method, absolutely. What about this part?
>> Speaker 2: The name property.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we are pushing it to the game. Which is an object. So we can't push things to an object.

[00:09:34]
We can only push things to an array. So we need to get to, that point was we just need a reference, the next nested property. Cool, so now we're gonna move on, unless we have any questions, to nested properties. What's up?
>> Speaker 2: Just little, circle back from the previous, before the break.

[00:09:54]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm?
>> Speaker 2: If we were to assign game, as a array?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.
>> Speaker 2: So then you would still work as an array of object?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So are you saying if we just did this?
>> Speaker 2: Yeah
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, everything will work exactly the same.
