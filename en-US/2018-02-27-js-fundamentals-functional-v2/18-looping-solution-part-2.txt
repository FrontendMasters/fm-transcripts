[00:00:00]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So, the exercise was to loop through all the properties of the suspect objects in the suspects array, and mark them if you think you're guilty. I'm curious to see how you guys approached it.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we still have this game here.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Do you wanna? Take a step.

[00:00:23]
Did you finish it?
>> Speaker 2: Mostly, I used for each method on here.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: You used for each? Did anyone use a loop? Cool. You used loop?
>> Speaker 3: It's a four in like you're shown there.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah. Cool. We're gonna do for each next though. You're ahead of the game all right, so walk me through it.

[00:00:43]

>> Speaker 3: Yeah, sure, so I just declared a function called game loop, so var game loop difficult function.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
>> Speaker 3: First line of that is a for loop Ivar = 0
>> Speaker 3: I less than games.suspects.length, i plus, plus.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: .length, you guys have to be my spell check here, okay.

[00:01:15]

>> Speaker 3: I did the for in loop, so I said for key in game.suspects i and then, first line of that is if statement. I didn't really know exactly how to figure out whose guilty. You know I was thinking of getting like a kind of confidential object, but for now I thought rusty was it.

[00:01:42]
So I said if game.suspects at i and then bracket key. Because I noticed you can't use .key here. For whatever reason that didn't work. Maybe you can explain, but I had to do this. So if that all equals, equals, Rusty, I just said Rusty in string. Then I would have a log that says found one or a return true, maybe, just did a log there, found him, yeah.

[00:02:20]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: If I could type.
>> Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and then else not this time, or something like that.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right.
>> Speaker 3: So since we have one of the things matching that should return one found them and the rest next time.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, I like it. How many times does this outer loop run?

[00:03:01]
I feel like I pick on the people on the outside the most. I actually haven't talked to our friend in the back. How many times does this loop run?
>> Speaker 3: It runs for each entry.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: For each what?
>> Speaker 3: Runs for each entry in suspects.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so each suspect object, right?

[00:03:21]
So a number form, two times, right? Cool. How many times does this loop run?
>> Speaker 4: Four.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah. And what order does it running? So if I was going to console that log and I'm gonna try to do this quick. Outer loop, then we console that log, inner loop.

[00:04:02]
What pattern would it log? Someone in this area of the room. I'm getting like decision fatigue choosing people.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So, what's the first thing that I will log? How about Cameron? Sorry.
>> Speaker 5: Outer loop?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yep. So it will log outer loop. And then, our lawyer friend. what's the next thing that it'll log?

[00:04:48]

>> Speaker 6: In a loop.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
>> Speaker 7: And then another inner loop.
>> Speaker 8: And then two more inner loops.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Not quite, so. At this point our our first inner loop suspect is gonna be our very first one, right? It's gonna be Rusty, orange. So, for all the keys in this object, it's gonna run it twice.

[00:05:18]
So, the first one is name, right? Next one is caller, and then that's it. So then we break out of this loop and we continue back here.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Assuming that we didn't hit this if else statement, which we would have. Does that make sense, why it doesn't keep looping?

[00:05:45]

>> Speaker 8: Not really, if you can go over it.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Sure, one more time. So do you know what this object is?
>> Speaker 8: Yeah, it is the first key in suspects. It's Rusty and orange.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so it's going to loop through this object. So there are two properties to this object.

[00:06:11]
Right, the name, and then there's a a color. So it's gonna loop through both of those. And that's all it knows about because, i is 0. And we've only made it that far so loop doesn't like jump ahead it doesn't know that in fact we are gonna ask it to loop again for the next one but, it won't know that until we say game suspects at one.

[00:06:37]
See what I mean does that clarify? Yeah, cool. So we have outer loop, inner loop, inner loop, and then this corner over here. How about on the end, what's the next thing that's gonna log? Do you know?
>> Speaker 7: Outer loop?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Not quite since suspects at i is rusty.

[00:07:10]
So what's the next thing?
>> Speaker 7: If it's rusty it's gonna be found on.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, awesome. And then what's the next thing that's gonna run? Next door.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Right there, yeah. What's the next log?
>> Speaker 9: Me?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: He's like not me, please.
>> Speaker 9: You fulfill the logic when you found Rusty, right?.

[00:07:40]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: When you say we fulfilled the logic, what does that mean?
>> Speaker 9: It was equal to Rusty so log you found so you resumed on the if.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Then if you iterate again.
>> Speaker 9: Then you gonna go through that process and catch the else.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Well what's the very next thing that happens?

[00:08:02]
After this. So you're right that we met a condition for a if statement, we entered into an if block and then we're gonna move on from that.
>> Speaker 9: You're probably gonna go back to the outer loop.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Speaker 9: And repeat the operation.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: So we'll console log outer loop next.

[00:08:18]

>> [BLANK AUDIO]
>> Bianca Gandolfo: And then next
>> Speaker 3: Inner loop twice more.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yup, we'll do inner loop.
>> Speaker 3: Shouldn't found him actually be before the first inner loop? Or matching the name?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, you mean like this one should be later. Well I think, I mean there's no guarantees, but we'll just pretend that it's name.

[00:08:48]
Just for fun. So then it's going to be inter looped. What's that?
>> Speaker 3: There's no guarantee on the order of the properties?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Nah, we'll just pretend. And then, we're gonna enter into the if else. What do you think it's going to log? We're here.
>> Speaker 4: Why is it running again through it?

[00:09:09]
Why didn't it stop after Rusty, it did a console.log found 'em why would it go-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Where did it tell it to stop? Cuz [INAUDIBLE] Mm-hm. How could you tell it to stop? Do you know?
>> Speaker 3: Break.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Break. Yeah, you could break keep you return stuff like that.

[00:09:30]

>> Speaker 3: Cool.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Would it log, so it's just gonna to do Rusty.
>> Speaker 4: Well the color is orange.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, it's gonna be the next property. So then it will say next time.
>> Speaker 4: Okay.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Does that makes sense?
>> Speaker 4: It's not Rusty.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Speaker 4: That has to be.

[00:09:50]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah. Cool. Do you guys see where this is going and how this flows? Okay, cool, I think we should take a break. It's been an hour.
>> Speaker 3: Can we run it once just to see if we're right?
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: We need this.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Just because I don't wanna run it anymore, issues with that game has already been declared.

[00:10:35]
All right.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so game loop. What did I say game23.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: This is a problem, you guys are supposed to be my spell check.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, all right now I think we're ready, let's see. So we have outer loop, inner loop, found them, inner loop. Should we look at it side by side maybe?

[00:11:35]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: All right let's see, outer loop, inner loop, found them, we did make a mistake.
>> Speaker 3: It's gonna go through inner loop again, and then next time-
>> Bianca Gandolfo: How did I get there? Okay,
>> Bianca Gandolfo: I thought that's what we did, well.
>> Speaker 3: Then to inner loop next times.

[00:12:04]

>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah. Why does it go through all of them.
>> Speaker 3: Going back through both of the properties.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: What's that?
>> Speaker 3: The part you missed was the inner loop going through multiple properties.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah well the second we didn't finish the second one but yeah, I think we

[00:12:18]

>> Speaker 3: And our loop's gonna run twice, cuz it's going through two different keys.
>> Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and it's also gonna be hitting this if, else which we'll be logging as well, cool.
