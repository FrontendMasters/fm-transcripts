00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.078
I mentioned before that there is also
another app that is Chromium-based and

2
00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:07.090
that's freezing detection.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.390
So the Page Lifecycle API it's okay, okay?

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.842
But it's also been fire
when we are getting out of

5
00:00:16.842 --> 00:00:21.306
the app because we are going
to another website.

6
00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:26.853
It's also been Firefox when
you put another window on top.

7
00:00:26.853 --> 00:00:32.323
So can we be more specific
about saving data only

8
00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:37.940
if my app is actually
going to be suspended?

9
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.422
Well, we have this API,
it's called the Page Lifecycle API and

10
00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:45.750
it's only available on Chromium-browsers.

11
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.733
This feels weird but
even on Android sometimes the API is not

12
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:57.160
working where it's actually more useful.

13
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.070
So this API works for
sure on Chrome on desktop.

14
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.170
But now you're thinking,
do we have suspension on desktop?

15
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.510
That's interesting, right?

16
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.190
So can we actually discard a tab?

17
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.590
I will show you in
a second how that works.

18
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.193
On Chrome I'm not sure if
you have ever seen that URL.

19
00:01:21.193 --> 00:01:26.150
Well, it's time for
doing that for the first time.

20
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.439
So if you open Chrome and
you go to Chrome discards,

21
00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.760
you will see something like this.

22
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.420
It's not a nice UI, it's not the best
UI that you will see in Chrome.

23
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.440
What's the idea?

24
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.967
I can open different UIs,
different URLs here like Twitter and

25
00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:53.250
many others and
you will see here all your tabs.

26
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.750
Let me increase the font size.

27
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.928
So here you will see this is for debugging
purposes only, it's not for the end user.

28
00:02:00.928 --> 00:02:03.410
You will see all your current tabs, okay?

29
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.670
The current visibility state, okay?

30
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.142
So that's the page visibility API,
the loading state,

31
00:02:12.142 --> 00:02:16.596
and the lifecycle state,
and discard count.

32
00:02:16.596 --> 00:02:21.460
Actually in Google Chrome
tabs can be discarded.

33
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.547
It's only on very special situations for
example,

34
00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:32.260
here to test this we have
some links here at the top.

35
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.319
For example,

36
00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.267
we can click here urgent discard
a tab now is like I need memory now.

37
00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:43.196
So if I click here it will just take
one of the tabs that are not seen so

38
00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:47.617
one of the hidden tabs, and
it will discard the tab, okay?

39
00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:48.692
So let's try it.

40
00:02:48.692 --> 00:02:55.890
I click it there and
it seems like, here it is.

41
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.800
Now I have this urgent
discard link on both.

42
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.240
I can select which one they wanna discard.

43
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.990
So I can discard this one.

44
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.350
So now that tab is discarded.

45
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.370
How do I know?

46
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.437
You don't actually know as a user but
if I go back,

47
00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:15.540
let's do that with Twitter as well.

48
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.100
So now both are discarded.

49
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.094
If I go back to that tab that
tab will reload because it

50
00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:29.130
wasn't actually loaded,
it was discarded, okay?

51
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.442
So this happens on desktop
only on low memory situations,

52
00:03:33.442 --> 00:03:36.170
on memory pressure, RAM pressure.

53
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.399
In that case when you have 80 tabs
open there will be a couple that will

54
00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:44.190
be discarded by Chrome.

55
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.550
Other browsers such as Brave,
they are more aggressive with this.

56
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.160
And they discard tabs more often
than Google Chrome itself.

57
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.810
Makes sense?

58
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.442
There is another extension
as well available,

59
00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:05.266
the extension, okay?

60
00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:09.599
It's here it's called
the greater discarder, okay?

61
00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.723
So with the greater discarder
you can even pin this so

62
00:04:13.723 --> 00:04:18.422
actually if I pin this,
let's pin the greater discarder.

63
00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:24.454
You can go to your tab and
click discard this tab.

64
00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:31.260
And what will happen is that it will
change tabs so that it can discard it.

65
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.724
So actually we can
discard tabs on desktop.

66
00:04:35.724 --> 00:04:41.664
And we have a way in Chrome only or
Chromium based browsers

67
00:04:41.664 --> 00:04:47.870
only to know that that's happening or
that that happened.

68
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.216
The event is called freeze, okay?

69
00:04:52.216 --> 00:04:56.727
So freeze means this is your last dinner.

70
00:04:56.727 --> 00:05:00.823
This is your last
opportunity to save data.

71
00:05:00.823 --> 00:05:06.136
This tab is about to freeze so
that means you

72
00:05:06.136 --> 00:05:11.455
won't be able to execute code after this.

73
00:05:11.455 --> 00:05:14.393
So then you save data.

74
00:05:14.393 --> 00:05:18.940
Remember that the other operation
can happen in two ways.

75
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.363
When the user is going back to your app
maybe your app is still in memory or

76
00:05:23.363 --> 00:05:26.400
maybe your app was discarded,
you don't know.
