00:00:00.453 --> 00:00:05.281
We've covered today JavaScript in
the background, the web app lifecycle.

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:08.440
Remember that what happens
when you go to the background,

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.382
where are all the background
possibilities, the background's life.

4
00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:14.336
What happens with timers?

5
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:16.918
Timers might get throttled,

6
00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:21.983
also your whole website might
be suspended or discarded.

7
00:00:21.983 --> 00:00:23.585
We've talk about detection.

8
00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:27.953
API's for detection such as
the page visibility API, and

9
00:00:27.953 --> 00:00:31.351
the lifecycle API that it's chromium only.

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.670
The basics of notifying the user while in
the background, because we don't have DOM.

11
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.090
We don't have user interface,
service workers,

12
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.230
very basic idea just to sit on
top of that lots of other API's.

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.196
Execution in the background,
we've seen all the API's that

14
00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:54.163
can actually let us do something
in the background no matter if

15
00:00:54.163 --> 00:00:58.675
the user keeps the PWA or
the website in the foreground.

16
00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:04.975
Or even open, such as background sync,
the beacon API, media API's.

17
00:01:04.975 --> 00:01:09.435
Periodic background scene,
background fetch, and now Web Push.

18
00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:14.115
So that's actually everything that
exists today in the web platform,

19
00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:17.859
at least in the standards,
not without extensions, and

20
00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:23.750
native apps around that has to do with
background execution with JavaScript.

21
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.350
Well, remember you have the final
version in the project, so in case you.

22
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.749
You weren't coding, you have the final
version that is probably not 100% the same

23
00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:36.183
but it's kind of the same idea that
you have there working in case you

24
00:01:36.183 --> 00:01:37.404
want to play with that.

25
00:01:37.404 --> 00:01:41.988
Also you have that hidden cam that will
let you see what's going on if you want to

26
00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:46.173
play with that as well with your real
devices and see what happens when.

27
00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:49.970
The window goes to the background,
what happens with your timers,

28
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.513
with your service workers,
with your web workers, and so on.

29
00:01:53.513 --> 00:02:00.267
So after saying that,
I have only one work, thanks.

30
00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.954
