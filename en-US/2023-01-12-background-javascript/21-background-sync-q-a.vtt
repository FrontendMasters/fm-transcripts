WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.474
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I was curious,

2
00:00:02.474 --> 00:00:07.870
the word sync is the event, the event
that we're catching is sync, right?

3
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.119
That I think maybe what I was wondering
about when you alluded to this was,

4
00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.792
that seems to be an event that gets fired
when a sync is successfully completed,

5
00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:21.931
not when one is attempted and then-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

6
00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:23.189
&gt;&gt; Is that right?

7
00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
you're complaining about the event name.

8
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.852
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, yes, it's not quite
as specific as some of the others.

9
00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:34.428
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not.

10
00:00:34.428 --> 00:00:40.610
In this case, well,
also push, what does it say?

11
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.900
It's like push received, it's like push.

12
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.075
And even I think it's using push
as a noun, not even as a verb.

13
00:00:48.075 --> 00:00:52.895
So that's an event,
it's kind of, what is that?

14
00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:59.452
Well, we need to add some context to
the event name in the case of sync means,

15
00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:05.609
hey, I have an unprocessed sync operation,
try now, try to sync now.

16
00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:10.441
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; That's kind of the event.

17
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:15.661
The event is for
us to try to sync the data and

18
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:19.442
fulfill that sync operation.

19
00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:23.726
&gt;&gt; I see, so this data doesn't
get pushed to the client or

20
00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:27.093
to the service worker with the sync event.

21
00:01:27.093 --> 00:01:29.975
The sync event is saying,
server would like to sync and

22
00:01:29.975 --> 00:01:33.496
then it's on us to reach out-
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah, in fact,

23
00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:37.899
if you look here, I never said
what the sync operation means,

24
00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.911
it's just a name, a label, the tag,
it's a tag name, that's all.

25
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:49.840
I didn't set if it's a request to the
server or maybe it's a sync to a database.

26
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.696
&gt;&gt; Typically we do this with
HTTP requests or we do that for

27
00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:58.898
HTTP requests but it can do anything.

28
00:01:58.898 --> 00:02:02.839
So maybe I wanna think something
in my index DV database.

29
00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:05.669
I wanna parse something from index DV,

30
00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:10.664
I wanna take something from a database and
create another database.

31
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:16.098
Instead of doing that in the main
context or in a worker attached

32
00:02:16.098 --> 00:02:21.237
to the main worker,
I can ask the service worker to do that.

33
00:02:21.237 --> 00:02:28.308
Remember, have in mind this
API is chromium only, for now.

34
00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:34.537
We don't know if Safari, or WebKit
is going to implement that any time.

35
00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:35.951
&gt;&gt; But conceptually,

36
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:40.783
you could implement sort of the same
thing with a push, or a website.

37
00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:44.819
&gt;&gt; The problem with the push is
that the push will notify the user.

38
00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:45.657
&gt;&gt; And this will not?

39
00:02:45.657 --> 00:02:48.535
&gt;&gt; This will not and requires permission.

40
00:02:48.535 --> 00:02:49.940
This will not.

41
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.865
So the only alternative to these is to
just send the message to a service worker.

42
00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:00.792
In a standard,
like through a broadcast channel,

43
00:03:00.792 --> 00:03:05.557
you send a message to a service
worker to actually do the sync.

44
00:03:05.557 --> 00:03:10.087
The only thing that so
far is not going to do that in that case

45
00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:14.622
is retry in two hours if
the connection is not working now.

46
00:03:14.622 --> 00:03:19.273
&gt;&gt; Right, so it's on your application to
manage a connectivity issue instead of

47
00:03:19.273 --> 00:03:21.443
allowing the browser-
&gt;&gt; It's up to you.

48
00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:22.700
&gt;&gt; Queue them up.

49
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.440
&gt;&gt; For example,
some service worker frameworks

50
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.824
such as workbooks, they have a fallback.

51
00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:36.448
So they have its own internal
algorithm to fall back to

52
00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:41.293
other mechanisms in case
the sync API is not available.

53
00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:46.067
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

54
00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:50.048
I'm trying to connect to a use case.

55
00:03:50.048 --> 00:03:51.752
I just wanted to check with you.

56
00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:56.447
For example,
I have a browser that opens the UI, but

57
00:03:56.447 --> 00:04:00.516
I deployed with newer
version in the server.

58
00:04:00.516 --> 00:04:06.033
So unless I do a hard refresh,
I don't see the newer versions, the.

59
00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:09.532
Is there a way that sync works like,
hey, I have a new version,

60
00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:13.243
the server gets sort of the push
notification or something to see-

61
00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:15.620
&gt;&gt; Well, you can do that with push, but

62
00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.399
there is no direct relationship
between a push and a sync.

63
00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:23.099
So if a push message is
waking up the service worker,

64
00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:28.244
the service worker can take advantage
of that moment to update the data.

65
00:04:28.244 --> 00:04:34.384
You don't need to wake up the service
worker and register a sync.

66
00:04:34.384 --> 00:04:38.888
I mean, you can, but you're already
there so you can take advantage of

67
00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:43.635
that moment and download the new data
at that moment when the push arrives.

68
00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:47.425
Unless the connection isn't working so

69
00:04:47.425 --> 00:04:52.669
in that case you can leave
a pending sync for the future.

70
00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.591
So you can try again later, make sense?

71
00:04:55.591 --> 00:04:57.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

72
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.130
Any question on, it's just that so there
is nothing else to talk about this API.

73
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.078
It's actually pretty simple.

74
00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:13.214
That's background sync and
what we have in within

75
00:05:13.214 --> 00:05:19.960
the service workers' dev tools,
a way to send a tag for testing.

76
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.910
Like, I don't know,
javascript rocks, or whatever.

77
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.480
What I need is the button sync.

78
00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:32.158
So that is sending a sync operation.

79
00:05:32.158 --> 00:05:37.315
So I'm getting in my service worker
an unknown sync with that Tag name.

80
00:05:40.802 --> 00:05:43.363
What are the other ways that we have for

81
00:05:43.363 --> 00:05:48.424
a server to unilaterally wake up your
service worker and interact with it?

82
00:05:48.424 --> 00:05:50.290
&gt;&gt; From your server, you say?

83
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.441
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, is that-
&gt;&gt; From the server there's only one way,

84
00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:59.140
and that's with push
with user's permission.

85
00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.960
If you want to wake up the service
worker from the server,

86
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.315
the only way you have is web push.

87
00:06:09.315 --> 00:06:12.885
&gt;&gt; And does that require the user's
permission once or every time?

88
00:06:12.885 --> 00:06:14.328
&gt;&gt; Once.

89
00:06:14.328 --> 00:06:16.671
&gt;&gt; But
they get the notification every time.

90
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:19.389
&gt;&gt; But they can deny identification-
&gt;&gt; A notification every time.

91
00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.739
&gt;&gt; Is a notification permission,
it's the same dialogue as notification.

92
00:06:23.739 --> 00:06:29.810
So push notification is just
one big umbrella, okay?

93
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.095
But web sync API,
the client is the one, so

94
00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:38.310
the web page client side is the one
registering the sync operation.

95
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.042
Yeah, you can trick these and
you can have a timer,

96
00:06:43.042 --> 00:06:48.434
the registers sync every half an hour
just to see if there is something new but

97
00:06:48.434 --> 00:06:51.230
yeah, it won't make any difference.
