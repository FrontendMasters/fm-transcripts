1
00:00:00.021 --> 00:00:02.886
Let's try to see this in action.

2
00:00:02.886 --> 00:00:10.099
Okay, so in background.js, now I think
I have another one media.js, okay?

3
00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:15.798
So, here I have already
a background audio playing.

4
00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:20.663
So if we look at the HTML,
in the HTML I have

5
00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:25.124
a video element and an audio element.

6
00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.152
This is HTML.

7
00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:31.500
Okay, nothing really fancy,
but using JavaScript and

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.291
these APIs,
I can actually add all the metadata.

9
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:37.873
So that's the change.

10
00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:43.100
For example, when I'm playing,
I hear there is an open

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.772
source royalty free song,
so when I'm playing so

12
00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:52.242
in the bottom play,
I want to add the metadata.

13
00:00:52.242 --> 00:00:56.879
So that metadata will let me
using the media session API,

14
00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.335
will let me in the background
interact with OS, okay?

15
00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:06.302
So from here for example,
in my Btnplay, before or

16
00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:11.498
after the play doesn't
matter in the event handler,

17
00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:19.019
so I'm going to talk with the
navigator.media session.metadata option.

18
00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:22.650
And I'm going to create
a new media metadata.

19
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.143
There is a constructor for that,

20
00:01:25.143 --> 00:01:30.134
that receives an object with all
the properties that I have to set.

21
00:01:30.134 --> 00:01:37.307
There are three mandatory properties
title, artist and artwork.

22
00:01:37.307 --> 00:01:40.021
You need to provide those three at least.

23
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:43.874
There are more properties that might
be used or not or might be ignored.

24
00:01:43.874 --> 00:01:48.093
So for example in this case
the title is too much funk.

25
00:01:48.093 --> 00:01:51.039
That's the name of the song.

26
00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.808
Then we have the artist,
this is the real artist, Steve Oaks.

27
00:01:56.808 --> 00:02:02.461
The album we could say, well,
I don't need the quotes here,

28
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:07.047
that this is Fronted Masters
greater hits maybe.

29
00:02:07.047 --> 00:02:12.256
And for the artwork,
it's actually an array of images

30
00:02:12.256 --> 00:02:18.837
that is following the same format as
in the web app manifest for PWAs.

31
00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:23.275
I'm not sure if you have
that object in mind, but

32
00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:27.715
actually it has source
with the URL of the image,

33
00:02:27.715 --> 00:02:32.079
type And sizes.

34
00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:38.701
Oops, so that's the structure, okay?

35
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.682
So I do have an E mash.

36
00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:46.378
It's media thumb dot png, okay?

37
00:02:46.378 --> 00:02:48.014
So I'm going to use that one.

38
00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:52.453
So it's media, from png.

39
00:02:52.453 --> 00:02:59.957
The type is image png, and the size is,
if I remember correctly, it's 800 by 800.

40
00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:06.527
So you can provide many, and each OS
will pick the one that it prefers, okay?

41
00:03:06.527 --> 00:03:10.467
So there are no standard icon sizes here,

42
00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:15.093
so every OS will just take
wherever you provide.

43
00:03:15.093 --> 00:03:18.596
So again, this is just metadata, and

44
00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:24.620
over the same object I could also
listen for JavaScript actions.

45
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.301
So then while you are in
the background from

46
00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:34.383
the watch you can do
something in JavaScript.

47
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.425
Makes sense?

48
00:03:40.174 --> 00:03:41.578
You have a question face, I'm not sure.

49
00:03:41.578 --> 00:03:45.142
&gt;&gt; And then thinking about like the other
ways that you can interact with that, so

50
00:03:45.142 --> 00:03:46.708
then like I think also like Siri and

51
00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:49.803
other voice assistants can then
interact with that media session.

52
00:03:49.803 --> 00:03:52.310
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, that's correct,

53
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.522
so both assistants they
are connected to those as well.

54
00:03:56.522 --> 00:04:01.123
&gt;&gt; That's very interesting that if
you're like streaming it to one of

55
00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:05.334
those speakers you can then
interact with your voice to have.

56
00:04:05.334 --> 00:04:07.968
You can navigate through
part of your JavaScript.

57
00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:08.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

58
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.315
&gt;&gt; I'm just thinking of the weird
things you could probably do with that,

59
00:04:12.315 --> 00:04:15.507
like if you go backwards,
it actually moves down the page.

60
00:04:15.507 --> 00:04:20.633
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
also let me increase the weirdness there,

61
00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:25.392
you could stream that
if it's video it's only

62
00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:30.275
also you can stream that
to Google cast device or

63
00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:35.422
Apple TV and
also you can use your remote control.

64
00:04:35.422 --> 00:04:40.441
So from your remote control you could
be actually executing JavaScript.

65
00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:43.139
&gt;&gt; And the homepods can hook
up to an Apple TV if you use

66
00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.899
the Siri on the homepod is
gonna go to your Apple TV,

67
00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:48.682
which goes to your phone
which controls a website.

68
00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:49.248
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

69
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:50.534
&gt;&gt; Which is very very strange.

70
00:04:50.534 --> 00:04:55.454
&gt;&gt; I actually could be someone on
a television program that you're watching

71
00:04:55.454 --> 00:04:59.486
that says, remote execution attack,
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so

72
00:04:59.486 --> 00:05:03.728
now you have a remote, boys,
child scraping checking attacks.

73
00:05:03.728 --> 00:05:07.481
&gt;&gt; You could like use the seek function
to scroll through your page and

74
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:10.564
do percentage of the way through
your song is how much of

75
00:05:10.564 --> 00:05:15.005
your website you're scrolled down to,
and have the worst website possible.

76
00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:16.010
&gt;&gt; That's what I want.

77
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.084
&gt;&gt; Well, let's see this in action.

78
00:05:17.084 --> 00:05:18.402
Let's see if that works.

79
00:05:18.402 --> 00:05:23.819
So I did that on the audio plane,
is this one,

80
00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.965
so if I hit play, we have the song.

81
00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:32.846
And on the OS you can see here,

82
00:05:32.846 --> 00:05:36.565
too much funk, okay?

83
00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:40.524
With the front and
master logo, so that works.

84
00:05:40.524 --> 00:05:45.474
And if we run this on the phone I
can show you that later if you want,

85
00:05:45.474 --> 00:05:51.150
it works also on the watch shaft by
sending metadata, and that also works.

86
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.756
Even if I minimize this, I'm not actually
seeing that I can still play in that.

87
00:05:57.756 --> 00:06:01.861
I remember that plays not just
playing the audio element,

88
00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:07.809
it executing the JavaScript event handler,
and you can do wherever you want there,

89
00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:12.190
not just working with the audio
that you're hearing, okay?

90
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.248
Make sense?

91
00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:17.688
So again, this is new in the JavaScript
in the background space.

92
00:06:17.688 --> 00:06:22.248
This is actually compatible
now with every browser, and

93
00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:25.009
it happened within the last year.

94
00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:32.520
It works on Safari also, so it works on
Android, on IOS, on iPad OS, and desktop.

95
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.544
Make sense?

96
00:06:35.544 --> 00:06:40.807
About Picture-in-Picture,
we do have a button here that

97
00:06:40.807 --> 00:06:46.923
toggle Picture-in-Picture, but
it's doing nothing right now.

98
00:06:46.923 --> 00:06:51.277
So I'm going to add the code.

99
00:06:51.277 --> 00:06:56.281
If I wanna directly start
Picture-in-Picture,

100
00:06:56.281 --> 00:07:01.412
I can get the element by ID or
by tag name or directly.

101
00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:03.871
Our new friend queryselector.

102
00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:07.352
I can take the video element,
I have only one.

103
00:07:07.352 --> 00:07:12.572
It just request Picture-in-Picture.

104
00:07:12.572 --> 00:07:14.301
It's just that fancy,
so it's pretty simple.

105
00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:20.269
And of course I can do the toggle thing,
so it gets in or out.

106
00:07:20.269 --> 00:07:24.001
Well, I think it's minimized, it's.

107
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:28.136
So if I hit Toggle immediately,

108
00:07:28.136 --> 00:07:34.273
even if it's not playing,
it goes to a window.

109
00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:38.689
It's as simple as that, and
if I want this to be toggled,

110
00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:41.637
you can see my window is there, okay?

111
00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:48.948
I should check if in the document,
we have the Picture-in-Picture element.

112
00:07:48.948 --> 00:07:52.533
And if it's there, it's because we
are already in Picture-in-Picture.

113
00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:57.006
So we are going to exit
Picture-in-Picture.

114
00:07:57.006 --> 00:08:00.692
And if not, we are going to
request Picture-in-Picture.

115
00:08:00.692 --> 00:08:01.997
This is going to toggle.

116
00:08:04.563 --> 00:08:07.280
Make sense?

117
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.520
It's as simple as that.

118
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.349
Any question?

119
00:08:11.349 --> 00:08:15.964
So toggle, toggle, gets in, get out.

120
00:08:15.964 --> 00:08:19.398
Of course the user is in charge also, so

121
00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:24.301
you can actually hit
the exits Picture-in-Picture.

122
00:08:24.301 --> 00:08:27.537
&gt;&gt; So this Picture-in-Picture will
be available even if you move from

123
00:08:27.537 --> 00:08:28.664
one tab to another tab.

124
00:08:28.664 --> 00:08:29.656
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

125
00:08:29.656 --> 00:08:34.635
So it's even if I minimize,
let me toggle this.

126
00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:39.100
Even if I minimize the browser or
if I go to another app,

127
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.185
it's always there,
running in the background.

128
00:08:43.185 --> 00:08:44.983
In this case is, is it running JavaScript?

129
00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:48.474
Not in my case, but
it could be running JavaScript as well.

130
00:08:48.474 --> 00:08:52.514
In fact, the code that generates each
frame of the video can be JavaScript.

131
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.959
&gt;&gt; Is this still having
the throttle issues or it will run?

132
00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:04.537
&gt;&gt; No, because when you are rendering
media playing in the background,

133
00:09:04.537 --> 00:09:07.961
your timers are not being
throttled in the same way.

134
00:09:07.961 --> 00:09:14.492
So you have the same power, the same
abilities as if you're in the foreground,

135
00:09:14.492 --> 00:09:19.671
because you need to provide enough
data to keep the frame rate.

136
00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:23.331
So the browser is giving you more power.

137
00:09:23.331 --> 00:09:24.816
Of course can you abuse that?

138
00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:30.020
Well, the user is seen
the Picture-in-Picture, so it's difficult.

139
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.347
Can you cryptomine?

140
00:09:31.347 --> 00:09:33.092
Can you do cryptomining with this?

141
00:09:33.092 --> 00:09:36.890
You can, but the user will see
something that means you need to

142
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.277
entertain the user while you're
doing cryptomining with something,

143
00:09:41.277 --> 00:09:43.633
because if not the user will close it.

144
00:09:43.633 --> 00:09:46.681
And if it closes it goes back to normal.

145
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:49.850
So we request Picture-in-Picture
to the video element and

146
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.279
we're requests exit in
Picture-in-Picture to the document.

147
00:09:53.279 --> 00:10:00.781
&gt;&gt; If you said this is added
u all videos automatically?

148
00:10:00.781 --> 00:10:04.075
&gt;&gt; It depends on the browser but, yeah.

149
00:10:04.075 --> 00:10:09.199
In that case, it depends on the browser
but if the browser like Chrome for

150
00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:12.985
example is adding that if
you're in probably macOS.

151
00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:17.359
So if I go back to the tab,
where is my tab?

152
00:10:17.359 --> 00:10:19.156
It's minimized.

153
00:10:19.156 --> 00:10:23.759
There is a menu here, so
it's always here in the drop down menu.

154
00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:25.999
Maybe Safari.

155
00:10:25.999 --> 00:10:28.627
So there is one.

156
00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:29.187
Yes, Safari.

157
00:10:29.187 --> 00:10:33.557
Safari is the one that is giving
you the icon there no matter what,

158
00:10:33.557 --> 00:10:36.502
even if you're not adding any JavaScript.

159
00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:39.661
So Safari works in the same way.

160
00:10:42.086 --> 00:10:46.610
Okay, so this is the one of
the biggest background execution

161
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.434
rules that has nothing to
do with service workers.
