WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.690
Well, let's go back to our push.js,
I think that this part is okay.

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.611
But now the last part is that we
need to actually send that data,

3
00:00:13.611 --> 00:00:17.870
the details that we have to our server.

4
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.510
Okay, so that's the last part.

5
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.390
So how are we going to do that?

6
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.529
If you look at our server,

7
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.098
our server already has an endpoint for

8
00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:37.679
a little API that says, /push/subscribe.

9
00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.148
There is expecting the data
to arrive as json.

10
00:00:42.148 --> 00:00:45.136
So what we need to do is make a fetch,

11
00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:49.980
from our client to that server,
okay, make sense?

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.420
But before doing that,
let's see how are we doing so far.

13
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.310
So I'm going to just do
a console log of the details and

14
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.651
maybe call my log API then say
that Web Push, subscribed.

15
00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:10.341
Check to see if we are good at this point.

16
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:15.300
What happens if you subscribe
to the pushManager twice?

17
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.040
Nothing, you will get
the same data in return So

18
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.811
every time you're getting to the website,
you are subscribing again.

19
00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:29.040
Okay, it will give you the same details.

20
00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.272
I will explain why that might
be useful at some point.

21
00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:40.516
Okay, well, let's see what happens.

22
00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:43.194
So I will refresh here.

23
00:01:45.456 --> 00:01:50.273
Be careful,
we need to check that maybe for later,

24
00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:53.187
that we have update on reload so

25
00:01:53.187 --> 00:01:58.245
when we change the service worker,
we will get that.

26
00:01:58.245 --> 00:02:03.577
And now if I try the push that by the way

27
00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:08.750
I think I didn't add it to the HTML.

28
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.100
So we can call this that was in the HTML.

29
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.534
The only thing that I'm I need to do,

30
00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:24.255
I didn't do this, is that by default,

31
00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:29.262
by CSS, my code is hiding the push because

32
00:02:29.262 --> 00:02:34.220
maybe the push is not there, right?

33
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.965
So what we need to do is
to change that from CSS.

34
00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:42.437
Yeah, I'm not using any library,
any reactive library,

35
00:02:42.437 --> 00:02:45.843
so plain JavaScript, Vanilla JavaScript.

36
00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:50.076
I'm not sure if you're rusty with that or
not, it's simple anyway,

37
00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:54.980
we just need to change CSS style, or
we can do a class wherever you want.

38
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.495
So, we have a button that is hidden,

39
00:02:57.495 --> 00:03:01.240
we have a whole section that is hidden for
push.

40
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.502
So what we need to do, we can check
that this push.js file in the HTML.

41
00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:13.902
It has a defer property.

42
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.770
Because of that, we know for
sure that the DOM is ready.

43
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.200
I don't need to wait for DOM content
loaded to do something like that.

44
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.799
So that means that here,
we can actually check if the API is ready,

45
00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:38.269
showNotification in
ServiceWorkerRegistrationPrototype and

46
00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:43.120
here we can go and enable the section.

47
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.180
Does it make sense?

48
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.250
So it means we Push is available,
so am going to enable

49
00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.460
the section from CSS,
or JavaScript plus CSS.

50
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.547
So, we're going to getElementById,

51
00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:04.030
push.style.display = block.

52
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.448
If this was a reactive library, well, I
just change a Boolean and a flag that will

53
00:04:09.448 --> 00:04:14.570
trigger re-rendering and it will
render that option, okay, make sense?

54
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.180
Do you have any questions so far?

55
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.188
&gt;&gt; I'm getting a
ServiceWorkerRegistrationPrototype is not

56
00:04:22.188 --> 00:04:22.899
defined.

57
00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:25.777
&gt;&gt; You've done prototype [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Dot also.

58
00:04:27.544 --> 00:04:32.177
But it's weird that you're getting an
error on that one because that one should

59
00:04:32.177 --> 00:04:33.086
be brady also.

60
00:04:33.086 --> 00:04:35.787
But, yeah, those prototypes
should work anyway, like this.

61
00:04:39.784 --> 00:04:41.978
Let's try to keep this consistent.

62
00:04:44.072 --> 00:04:50.337
Another way is to check for,
if you look here, what else you can check?

63
00:04:50.337 --> 00:04:52.760
You have also PushManager.

64
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:58.230
So also you can check if PushManager
is available in the window object.

65
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.923
That's another way, okay,
to check if the PushManager is available.

66
00:05:05.003 --> 00:05:08.875
Okay, so let's see now.

67
00:05:08.875 --> 00:05:12.478
I have now my section at the bottom that

68
00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:17.104
says Push Notifications,
okay, makes sense?

69
00:05:17.104 --> 00:05:25.215
If I try this on my IOS simulator
that today is not supporting the API,

70
00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:33.487
Localhost4000, I shouldn't see

71
00:05:33.487 --> 00:05:38.532
the Push API because it's not there yet.

72
00:05:38.532 --> 00:05:42.531
On the rest of the browsers today,
it's available.

73
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:46.407
Remember, for those of you on a Mac,
if you're using Safari,

74
00:05:46.407 --> 00:05:48.900
you need to be on Ventura.

75
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.130
If not, isn't gonna work, okay?

76
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.629
So if you do an upgrade yet,
it's not gonna work.

77
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:58.350
You can use Chrome or
Firefox to test this.

78
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.419
So actually, if I click Subscribe,

79
00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.674
I'm getting the permission dialogue for
local host, Allow.

80
00:06:06.674 --> 00:06:12.779
And after a while,
I'm getting the details in the console.

81
00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:16.540
So the first step is there.

82
00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:21.434
But if I try Firefox, let me try the same,

83
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:25.179
Websites on Firefox.

84
00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:26.930
I'm opening the console.

85
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:35.164
I have Push Notification,
Subscribe dialogue, Allow.

86
00:06:35.164 --> 00:06:40.232
And after a while I'm getting
PushSubscription detail.

87
00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:47.880
The endpoint points to another URL
that it's within Mozilla's boundaries.

88
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:54.230
It's updates.push.services.mozilla.com,
so that's the endpoint.

89
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.789
So why it's called endpoint?

90
00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.735
Because if you wanna send
the message to that user,

91
00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:01.899
you will need to send an HTTP
package to that endpoint.

92
00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:08.358
And then the payload,
the body of that request

93
00:07:08.358 --> 00:07:12.409
needs to be encrypted
with your private key.

94
00:07:14.156 --> 00:07:16.412
That's how the handshake works.

95
00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:22.240
The security handshake work between your
server, your website and the push server.

96
00:07:23.646 --> 00:07:26.498
Okay, make sense?

97
00:07:26.498 --> 00:07:27.094
&gt;&gt; Question?

98
00:07:27.094 --> 00:07:27.629
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

99
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.246
&gt;&gt; The public private key we created,
is it specific to any browser or

100
00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:32.352
is it application?

101
00:07:32.352 --> 00:07:35.827
&gt;&gt; No, it's per your app, actually.

102
00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:38.909
You need to save it every time you
create a new pair, it's a new pair,

103
00:07:38.909 --> 00:07:40.510
it's a random pair.

104
00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.263
Of course,
between them they're not random, but

105
00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:47.240
then you can use the same on any browser.

106
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.950
And the idea is that you will use the same
for the rest of the life of your web app.

107
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:57.290
If you change those keys,
then it will be like a separate app.

108
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:02.951
From a push server point of view,
you are at different app, so

109
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:07.415
you will lose control of sending
messages to your old users.

110
00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:11.320
&gt;&gt; The question came because we are
sending it to different endpoints, right,

111
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.275
one for the fcs.google,
another one is for the Mozilla.

112
00:08:14.275 --> 00:08:15.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

113
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.932
&gt;&gt; They were same public,
&gt;&gt; They have their own databases,

114
00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:22.865
their own implementations of the spec and

115
00:08:22.865 --> 00:08:27.575
they will all save your public key
attached to your origin as well.

116
00:08:27.575 --> 00:08:31.820
We're on Safari, Safari on Ventura, okay?

117
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:36.590
So I will open the console as well,
Subscribe.

118
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.470
And it says, look at that.

119
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:44.084
It says that, the Provided
applicationServerKey does not match

120
00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:46.870
the key in the existing subscription.

121
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:47.640
What's that?

122
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.710
It seems like I have already subscribed
the user to this port number.

123
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.070
And it says, you already have a
subscription key and it's not the same, so

124
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.680
I'm not going to register this.

125
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.010
Can this happen?

126
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.510
Yes.

127
00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:06.338
What can you do about that?

128
00:09:06.338 --> 00:09:10.777
Actually on Safari today in
the current implementation, nothing

129
00:09:13.456 --> 00:09:20.933
This is like the example that you
mentioned recently, you change the key.

130
00:09:20.933 --> 00:09:25.925
&gt;&gt; Do you mean you as the application
engineer or you as the user of Safari?

131
00:09:25.925 --> 00:09:28.845
&gt;&gt; Well, both to be honest,
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

132
00:09:28.845 --> 00:09:30.495
&gt;&gt; I mean, as an application engineer

133
00:09:30.495 --> 00:09:33.425
here, yeah,
you can change the port number, okay?

134
00:09:33.425 --> 00:09:36.705
And to see what happens if
you change your port number?

135
00:09:36.705 --> 00:09:40.325
&gt;&gt; No, I meant to clear out that
current registration or something.

136
00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:43.750
&gt;&gt; Well, that's cool, how can we see here.

137
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.816
Well, here you can see work,
what can I do in Safari, okay?

138
00:09:48.816 --> 00:09:53.060
Where can I see the details for
this website?

139
00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:58.929
So I have a bookmark, share,
reload, compared with Chrome,

140
00:09:58.929 --> 00:10:03.160
the UX that Safari has
it's actually weird.

141
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.880
I mean, you can go to Settings, okay.

142
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.325
In Settings, you can check Websites,
on Websites, okay,

143
00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:13.360
we can say, okay, what do we wanna see?

144
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.705
Notifications, okay, here are different
notifications that we need

145
00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:25.430
to find local host here that says,
allows and I'm going to, I can deny them.

146
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.410
That's revoking permission.

147
00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:28.490
Why can't remove them?

148
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.358
Remove will actually
remove the subscription.

149
00:10:35.435 --> 00:10:39.484
Yeah, probably who is
going to get into here?

150
00:10:39.484 --> 00:10:42.230
No, it's actually pretty difficult,
right, to actually get there.

151
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.039
I think that Chrome has the better UX and
Firefox as well.

152
00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:50.390
Because on Firefox,
you can also click on the details, okay?

153
00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:55.600
And everything you have
here like the permissions

154
00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.840
the UX feels better, okay,
in terms of how that works.

155
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.460
So now I deleted that,
let's see what happens if I try again.

156
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.533
Now, I'm seeing again,
this is the dialog for Safari,

157
00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:13.920
it's different from the other dialogues,
okay?

158
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.910
It's different.

159
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:20.278
If I allow this,
I should get in the console at one point,

160
00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:24.500
the endpoint that points
your web.push apple.com.

161
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.710
So we have the three browsers
working with our code right now.
