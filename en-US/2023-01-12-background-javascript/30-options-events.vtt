WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.600
At this point, you can understand why
this is complicated to the bottom.

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.042
And think about thousands of users with
many versions of the ServiceWorker

3
00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:14.870
because maybe the user is not
coming back to your website.

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.456
But again, we are not going to
the service workers details.

5
00:00:21.456 --> 00:00:26.202
But having mind that when you send
a push message and the ServiceWorker

6
00:00:26.202 --> 00:00:32.360
activates for the first time in a while,
it will check if there is a new version.

7
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.990
And if there is a new version,

8
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.720
it will install the new version that
will be ready for the next push.

9
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.095
Okay, so it's we are uncomplicated,
but yeah, with enough information and

10
00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:52.501
enough organization,
you can version your service workers.

11
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:58.976
You can log that in your server, you can
know which versions users have, and so on.

12
00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:04.327
Okay, make sense,
do you have any question at this point?

13
00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.351
What else can we do here
in the notification?

14
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:14.190
So if I'm going to the ServiceWorker,
but if you look here,

15
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.710
it's the ServiceWorker, the one that is
sending the notification, not the server.

16
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.667
So the server is waking up, but
the one that generates the UI,

17
00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:31.273
the visual notification
is the ServiceWorker,

18
00:01:31.273 --> 00:01:34.320
and here I have a larger object.

19
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.090
So I can show you everything that

20
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.077
can be done in notification.

21
00:01:49.697 --> 00:01:56.824
Fact is let's see the another example,
registration show notification for

22
00:01:56.824 --> 00:02:01.217
the master, and
that option, it's long one.

23
00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:06.439
So we have the body, we have already
seen that one, we can specify direction

24
00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.840
that for Arabic or Hebrew, okay,
you can change that, you can have actions.

25
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.280
What's an action buttons that you
can have in your notification?

26
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.360
To be honest on desktop, they look weird,
they look really nice on Android.

27
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.670
So the notification can include actions,
buttons, makes sense?

28
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.924
So then you can say yes, no.

29
00:02:31.924 --> 00:02:35.355
I mean, the notification can have
a question and then yes or no.

30
00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:39.670
And you can provide different icons,
okay, for that, and yeah,

31
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.470
we'll explain, okay, where?

32
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.815
What happens with the action?

33
00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:44.750
Okay, wait a minute.

34
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.170
Well icon, a batch, what's the difference
between the icon and the batch?

35
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.505
The batch is the little icon that
appears in the Android status bar,

36
00:02:56.505 --> 00:02:59.510
okay, that sometimes is grayscale.

37
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.538
So you can change the icon that you
see when you open the notification

38
00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:10.335
from this molar icon from
the status bar on Android.

39
00:03:10.335 --> 00:03:16.453
Okay, an image so you can provide like
a larger image it can be a photo.

40
00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:21.859
For example, when you receive a photo from
WhatsApp, you can get a thumbnail of that

41
00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.052
photo in the notification itself that then
you can see in your watch for example.

42
00:03:27.052 --> 00:03:32.461
Remember that you will see web push
notifications on watches as well.

43
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:37.960
Okay, vibration, this works on
Android only on some Androids also.

44
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.981
You will find here a vibration pattern,
this is vibration, delay,

45
00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:47.758
or pause, vibration pause,
vibration pause in milliseconds.

46
00:03:47.758 --> 00:03:51.645
&gt;&gt; Is there limit on that?

47
00:03:51.645 --> 00:03:53.565
Can we do like nine million seconds?

48
00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:57.792
&gt;&gt; You could, but yeah, so
the spec has no limit to

49
00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:03.530
be honest on most I think this
works on Firefox Android.

50
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.518
Chrome on Android depends on
the manufacturer, it's not gonna work, so

51
00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:11.990
it doesn't work really consistently.

52
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.820
Hey, the vibration, you can make a sound
as well in the real world doesn't work.

53
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.214
The idea is that you can provide
an mp3 file that will be played when

54
00:04:22.214 --> 00:04:26.293
the notification is arrived like
your own sound for that, but

55
00:04:26.293 --> 00:04:30.305
it doesn't work, it's in the spec,
but it doesn't work.

56
00:04:30.305 --> 00:04:35.185
Attire, this is to identify that
notification if you have more

57
00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:40.174
than one notification that will
explain why it's useful data.

58
00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:44.517
You can attach payload
to the notification,

59
00:04:44.517 --> 00:04:49.544
a timestamp, this is so
when some operating systems

60
00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:55.890
render the notification it
says a day ago four hours ago.

61
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.712
Because maybe you have just
received the notification, but

62
00:04:58.712 --> 00:05:00.490
it's what generated four hours ago.

63
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.870
Okay, make sense?

64
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:10.717
Require interaction if you say true,
typically it works on Android only,

65
00:05:10.717 --> 00:05:16.079
then the user will have to like
click on it to do this method.

66
00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:20.515
Renotify true if you say true,
false is the default,

67
00:05:20.515 --> 00:05:25.990
if you say true, it's saying,
hey, I'm using the same tag.

68
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.231
So it's the same ID,
it is the same authentication,

69
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:34.140
I don't wanna just silently modify
the contents, I wanna re-notify the user.

70
00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.032
So like vibrate again or sound again, and

71
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:41.920
silent, true, or false,
it's in the spec, but isn't gonna work.

72
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.630
So this is a lot of based
on a best effort actually.

73
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.110
The question is what about actions?

74
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.930
What about ID?

75
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.480
So how can I play with that?

76
00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.331
Well, there are more events
in the ServiceWorker such

77
00:06:00.331 --> 00:06:05.083
as push such as terminal push,
notification click.

78
00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:09.033
So if the user is clicking
in one notification,

79
00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:12.998
you will get here in your
ServiceWorker a call.

80
00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:19.037
And in the event, you will receive
the data, the payload that you sent,

81
00:06:19.037 --> 00:06:25.571
you will receive the tau, so you know
exactly which notification is that one,

82
00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:29.043
and you will receive an optional action.

83
00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:35.571
So in the case, there is an action,
because maybe there are no actions,

84
00:06:37.843 --> 00:06:41.779
You will know here which
button the user has used.

85
00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:45.034
So then you can just notify your server,

86
00:06:45.034 --> 00:06:50.034
you can send a request saying
the user says yes or no to this ID.

87
00:06:53.521 --> 00:06:55.875
Make sense?
What else you can do here?

88
00:06:55.875 --> 00:07:01.018
This is the only place in
the whole ServiceWorker

89
00:07:01.018 --> 00:07:06.035
ecosystem where you can
actually focus the user

90
00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:11.690
browser in your tab or
you can open a new tab only here.

91
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.020
So a ServiceWorker cannot open tabs
because it's in the background,

92
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.280
it's weird,
the only exception is notification click.

93
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.443
From notification click,

94
00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:30.084
you can open a new tab because the user
has clicked in the notification,

95
00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:35.458
so the user wants something, so
something can be opened in the URL.

96
00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:38.238
&gt;&gt; Is that in the event objects then?

97
00:07:38.238 --> 00:07:41.890
&gt;&gt; The opening the noise
in the clients API.

98
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:44.863
So the ServiceWorker
has a clients property.

99
00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:49.129
And the clients open a property
you can query all the clients, so

100
00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:54.106
you can see all the clients to see if
there was a client from a service workers

101
00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:57.602
perspective, a Window, or
a PWA from that origin?

102
00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:02.313
So you can query the clients and
see if you have one client available.

103
00:08:02.313 --> 00:08:07.083
And if it's there,
you can just focus on that one, so

104
00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:11.114
it will pop up the current
available Window or

105
00:08:11.114 --> 00:08:15.797
you can create from here,
you can open a new client.

106
00:08:15.797 --> 00:08:20.515
So this is known as the client API, so

107
00:08:20.515 --> 00:08:25.700
is the ServiceWorker client API on MDN.

108
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:32.324
You have what you can do so much all is
the way you have to actually search or

109
00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:36.132
see all the clients available right now.

110
00:08:36.132 --> 00:08:40.582
And you have the open Window
that will open a new Window, but

111
00:08:40.582 --> 00:08:45.398
clients open Window will work
only within notification click.

112
00:08:45.398 --> 00:08:50.140
That's the only place where you have
permission to actually open a Window.

113
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:55.190
So for example,
here you can open a Window to one URL that

114
00:08:55.190 --> 00:09:00.360
says notification click and
you pass the ID or whatever.

115
00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:08.495
You pass the tie and that will open
the browser in that particular URL,

116
00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:13.768
because remember,
everything happens in the background.

117
00:09:15.892 --> 00:09:19.875
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering how it knows it's
in the event listener like if we create

118
00:09:19.875 --> 00:09:22.877
a separate function called
handle notification click?

119
00:09:22.877 --> 00:09:27.644
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] It will work because I mean,
the browser knows the event that is

120
00:09:27.644 --> 00:09:31.602
firing the current execution,
it's in the call stack.

121
00:09:31.602 --> 00:09:34.240
So if it's in the call stack,
it will work.

122
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.922
The same happens that you cannot today
on Safari, for example, you cannot

123
00:09:38.922 --> 00:09:44.310
request permission for notification on
payload, you need user interaction.

124
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:49.369
So the browser knows if you're
executing a function, and

125
00:09:49.369 --> 00:09:56.508
in the cost stack, it's because there
was an click event, okay, make, sense?

126
00:09:56.508 --> 00:10:00.598
That's the push API,
then everything on top

127
00:10:00.598 --> 00:10:04.911
of that it's something
that you need to build.

128
00:10:04.911 --> 00:10:08.960
So the API is this, that's how it works.

129
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.245
There's nothing that we mentioned before,
but

130
00:10:11.245 --> 00:10:14.545
push messages can arrive when a web
app is active or when it's closed.

131
00:10:14.545 --> 00:10:16.662
If it's closed, it's simple, but

132
00:10:16.662 --> 00:10:19.950
if it's active maybe you don't
wanna open a new Window.

133
00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:25.223
You wanna send the message internally
to the page saying, hey, there is

134
00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:31.288
a message notifier, maybe you notify the
user internally or something like that.

135
00:10:31.288 --> 00:10:36.273
And I mentioned before,
you are not forced to notify the user

136
00:10:36.273 --> 00:10:41.376
with a payload's body,
you are forced to notify something.

137
00:10:41.376 --> 00:10:46.400
You can take advantage of the data
that the server send or not up to you.
