1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.540
So, let's then figure out how we're
actually gonna generate this modal.

2
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.950
So, this is gonna be another helper and
it's gonna be called modal.

3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.716
And this helper is going to accept
a few things that we call modal args,

4
00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:21.110
and that's gonna include a trigger ID,
we're gonna have the ID itself.

5
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.030
We will have the title, submit text,
which will default to be submit.

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.040
Whoops, submit, and then we want
the blocks that are gonna be displayed.

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.470
So, the blocks will come out of our
block utility that we just created.

8
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.610
So, the first thing we're gonna
send through is the trigger ID.

9
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.043
A trigger ID is something sent from
Slack that lets us identify which

10
00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.470
interaction we're responding to.

11
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.230
So, if two people were to run
the command at once, this is so

12
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.595
that we can disambiguate,
trigger ID one needs the first response,

13
00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:56.620
trigger ID two needs a second, and so on.

14
00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.644
Then we're gonna send in the view,
this is the actual blocks and

15
00:00:59.644 --> 00:01:02.310
information we're gonna
send back to the user.

16
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.153
So, we'll send a type of modal then we're
going to send a callback ID, which is

17
00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:13.496
how we identify what type of modal is
being sent that's gonna have an ID.

18
00:01:13.496 --> 00:01:17.714
The title is going to
be type plain text and

19
00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:23.869
we'll include the text of
whatever we defined as the title,

20
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:34.396
For our submit button,
we want type of plaintext again and

21
00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:38.578
a text of whatever our submit text is.

22
00:01:38.578 --> 00:01:40.690
And finally,
we wanna pass through the blocks,

23
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.316
these are the blocks that will
actually appear in the modal,

24
00:01:43.316 --> 00:01:45.803
those are gonna be our inputs,
select boxes, and so on.

25
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.635
So, now that we've got both the blocks
builder and the modal builder,

26
00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:58.150
we are ready to return one of
those from our slash command.

27
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.219
So, we can head into our actual
slash command handler here.

28
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.800
And we're going to get a few
more pieces out of our utility.

29
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.767
We're gonna get blocks, we're gonna
get modal and then down in here,

30
00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:21.050
we're gonna get rid of all of
this part that we've done so far.

31
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.505
And instead, what we're gonna do is
get a response out of the Slack API

32
00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:34.581
using the views dot open,
which is how we send a modal.

33
00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:40.467
And we pass in our modal helper, so
the ID is gonna be food fights modal and

34
00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:46.468
that just needs to be unique to you,
it's an identifier that we will use.

35
00:02:49.793 --> 00:02:56.074
Then we need to send in a trigger ID and
the trigger ID is sent through Slack.

36
00:02:56.074 --> 00:03:02.327
So, we just grab that trigger ID out and
then for blocks, we send in an array.

37
00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:06.987
And we're gonna put in
blocks dot section and

38
00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:13.868
this one is gonna say,
Let's give it a little,

39
00:03:13.868 --> 00:03:19.152
let's see,
the discourse demands food drama, and

40
00:03:19.152 --> 00:03:25.995
then we'll make some bold text so
send in your spiciest food takes so

41
00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:30.340
we can all argue about them and
feel alive.

42
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.961
Close up our bold tag, okay?

43
00:03:35.961 --> 00:03:41.331
Then we're going to add another block,
this is gonna be our input and

44
00:03:41.331 --> 00:03:45.500
this one is going to
have an ID of opinion.

45
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.483
It's gonna have a label of deposit your

46
00:03:50.483 --> 00:03:55.317
controversial food opinions here and

47
00:03:55.317 --> 00:04:00.452
then we're gonna have a placeholder and

48
00:04:00.452 --> 00:04:07.550
our placeholder is gonna be example,
peanut butter and

49
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.705
mayonnaise sandwiches are delicious.

50
00:04:12.705 --> 00:04:18.861
That's a real food opinion held
by a real person that's not me,

51
00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:23.421
initial value,
we will set the payload dot text

52
00:04:23.421 --> 00:04:28.551
which is what somebody would
type after the command,

53
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:32.770
we'll show how this works in a minute.

54
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.479
And if that's not set,
then we'll set it to blank.

55
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.542
And then as a hint so
that we can have something that doesn't

56
00:04:41.542 --> 00:04:48.532
disappear when you start typing, you can
say what do you believe about food that,

57
00:04:48.532 --> 00:04:53.394
add an extra space in here,
what do you believe about food

58
00:04:53.394 --> 00:04:57.982
that people find appalling,
say it with your chest.

59
00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:06.750
And then we're gonna
add in our select here.

60
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.220
So, let me blocks dot select and
we're gonna set an ID.

61
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.260
This is gonna be our spice level so
we're gonna let people

62
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.406
kind of identify how spicy
their opinion is, set the label

63
00:05:24.406 --> 00:05:30.410
of how spicy is this opinion, and
then we will set up a placeholder.

64
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.040
And for a select, it's kind of like what
shows when the select hasn't been used.

65
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.489
So, we're just gonna make it
an instruction, select a spice level.

66
00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:44.811
And then for the options,
we have an array and it's gonna be label.

67
00:05:47.277 --> 00:05:50.917
And the value, and these are the same,

68
00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:55.771
we probably could have
simplified our utility, but

69
00:05:55.771 --> 00:06:00.954
I thought in a lot of cases
you're gonna have a different

70
00:06:00.954 --> 00:06:07.813
value from what the label might be, so
it was worth not making it the same.

71
00:06:07.813 --> 00:06:12.499
And then we've got mild, medium, spicy,
and we'll add a nuclear option in

72
00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:16.896
case you've got something really out
there that you love about food, so

73
00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:26.267
then we can say if this, And
we're missing let's see,

74
00:06:30.483 --> 00:06:35.870
Start collapsing things down and figure
out what I missed, identifier expected,

75
00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:49.244
I have added an extra curly boy here,
okay,

76
00:06:49.244 --> 00:06:53.857
so just to reiterate what happened there.

77
00:06:53.857 --> 00:06:59.149
I had put a curly brace around this modal,
but because the modal returns that object,

78
00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:03.485
we don't want that, we instead want
this to be at the top level here and

79
00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:07.261
that will return the object that
we wanna pass in as the body.

80
00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:09.045
And then spell response correctly and

81
00:07:09.045 --> 00:07:11.671
that'll clear up this other
issue we'd had down here.

82
00:07:16.375 --> 00:07:21.391
So, this now is a working
modal hopefully so

83
00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:26.678
we can make sure our
command is still running,

84
00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:30.880
it is, I'm going to open up Slack and

85
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.102
let's head to our general channel.

86
00:07:40.618 --> 00:07:42.993
And now, we get a modal.
