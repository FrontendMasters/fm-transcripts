WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.726
With this setup,
we are able to stop here for a second and

2
00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:08.705
we're going to spend a little time in
the browser because the next thing that we

3
00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:11.230
need to do is set up our Slack app.

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:18.670
So I'm going to go to api.slack.com and
we're going to set up an app.

5
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.191
So I'm actually going to
delete my current app, and

6
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:24.840
we're gonna start from scratch here.

7
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.240
So, let's create a new one.

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.438
We're gonna go from scratch, and we want
this app to be called Foodfight, and

9
00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:37.936
we're gonna deploy it to my Learn
with Jason Slack instance, and

10
00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.609
we're gonna create this app.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.401
Okay so, what we've just done
is we have created a brand

12
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:53.730
new app that will be available only
currently to our instance of Slack.

13
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.650
So there are ways that you can
publish these as apps that any

14
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.540
Slack instance can install.

15
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.690
That's really not the point
of this particular workshop.

16
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.580
What we're trying to do
is build internal tools.

17
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.647
So the idea is that this is a private
app that will only be used by your Slack

18
00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:08.680
instance.

19
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.126
And that allows us to make it a little
more personalized to our team as opposed

20
00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:17.711
to something that would need to be more
generically applicable to any team that

21
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:18.276
uses it.

22
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.199
So the next thing that we want
to do is let's scroll down and

23
00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:27.050
add some details about the the app.

24
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.083
So I wanna make this just
a little more personable.

25
00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:35.884
So I'm gonna add like this
little smiling emoji,

26
00:01:35.884 --> 00:01:40.010
and then I'm gonna add some details here.

27
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.022
So, we'll say,

28
00:01:41.022 --> 00:01:46.150
argue with your coworkers about food
opinions that definitely don't matter.

29
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.430
We've got an asset for
the app icon that is in the GitHub repo.

30
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.031
So, if we go to that chat ops frontend
masters into assets, we can grab this and

31
00:01:57.031 --> 00:01:59.200
use this as a logo for the app.

32
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.540
So I'm going to open that.

33
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.610
I set a background color.

34
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.890
You're welcome to, you know, you can skip
all this stuff if you don't want to do it.

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.550
But so
this is 691487 as a background color.

36
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.870
And then as a long description,
I'm going to copy paste this out.

37
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.757
And what we've got here is just
a little fun copy to explain

38
00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:26.000
to people why this exists, right?

39
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.941
So, the app that we're building for
this one is not like task management

40
00:02:30.941 --> 00:02:37.260
specifically because I figured that would
be too idiosyncratic between teams.

41
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.356
So instead I'm using the same flow of,
we want to capture user

42
00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:47.550
input out of Slack and
then put it somewhere for later triage and

43
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.737
you can adopt this to your specific
workflow, you don't need to use mine.

44
00:02:53.737 --> 00:02:55.852
I think it should be it should
be something that you talk to

45
00:02:55.852 --> 00:02:56.780
your team about.

46
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.890
What information do you need,
why are you capturing it?

47
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.890
How does it get managed?

48
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.150
What are the intervals for it?

49
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.987
So we're intentionally going a little bit
silly with this app, to get away from

50
00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:10.890
the idea that I'm telling you this is
exactly how you should build the app.

51
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.942
And more, these are the mechanics
of building the app and

52
00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.150
you should adapt it to your team.

53
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.380
So once we have set that up,
let's save it.

54
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.370
And then we can go over to
this slash commands section.

55
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.475
So the place we're going to spend the most
time in this app is in this slash commands

56
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:30.350
and interactivity and shortcuts here.

57
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.100
So you'll see me go back
to these quite a bit.

58
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.339
So inside the slash commands,
we're going to create a new one and

59
00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:42.769
we're going to call this one Foodfight and

60
00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.878
the request URL is going
to be our nullify live URL.

61
00:03:46.878 --> 00:03:50.370
So I'm going to copy this,
and head back in.

62
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.910
And now there's a caveat to be made here.

63
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.616
And it's important because it
can get annoying, but to me,

64
00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:59.600
it's less annoying than
having to deploy every time.

65
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.400
Anytime you stop and restart your dev
server, it is going to change this URL.

66
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.651
This little hash here is going
to change every time we stop and

67
00:04:07.651 --> 00:04:09.200
start the dev server.

68
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.097
So because right now
I've stopped the server,

69
00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:17.978
I actually should start it again so
that we can try this out.

70
00:04:21.277 --> 00:04:22.700
Oops, I forgot to do the live flag.

71
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.231
Oops.

72
00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:30.880
There's the live flag.

73
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.289
And so here we can see we've got a new
hash, and so I'm gonna change this out.

74
00:04:40.731 --> 00:04:45.480
And now we've got a new
live URL that we can run.

75
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.222
And so anytime you make the change,

76
00:04:47.222 --> 00:04:50.950
you will need to edit this in the Slack
API dashboard, so that is important.

77
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.429
Next we can add just some details,
these will show up in Slack, so

78
00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:56.760
it's nice to have.

79
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.750
So I'm gonna add a short description of
start an argument about food as a treat.

80
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.454
And then as a usage hint,

81
00:05:03.454 --> 00:05:08.500
this is kind of saying like what
the parameters are of the command.

82
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.570
So I'm going to I'm going to set it to
say your most controversial food opinion.

83
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.882
And the intention here is that when
somebody writes a slash command,

84
00:05:15.882 --> 00:05:19.610
they don't even have to open the slash
command before they can start typing.

85
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.095
They can just say, slash,
FoodFight and then type a sentence.

86
00:05:23.095 --> 00:05:27.722
And that sentence will be what gets passed
in to the user input, so this is really

87
00:05:27.722 --> 00:05:31.729
really similar to what somebody would
do if they were just gonna say,

88
00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.479
hey can you help me build XYZ?

89
00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.411
Now they can just do slash request,
can you help me build XYZ right?

90
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:39.590
So again, compliance via convenience.

91
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:44.362
If somebody's gonna type in your Slack
channel anyways, letting them know

92
00:05:44.362 --> 00:05:49.431
that prefixing it with your slash command
means that it actually gets tracked and

93
00:05:49.431 --> 00:05:54.348
triaged and managed with a CLA from your
team like yes, we are actually going to

94
00:05:54.348 --> 00:05:59.785
earn, SLA from your team, we're going
to manage these tasks within x time.

95
00:05:59.785 --> 00:06:04.304
Those are really powerful ways to help
your team know how to work with you and

96
00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:07.533
feel confident that the way
they're working with you

97
00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.199
is going to actually work.

98
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.550
So once we've done that, we can save.

99
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:19.108
And then I'm going to minimize this and
I'm going to open up Slack.

100
00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:23.437
So this is a Slack workspace and

101
00:06:23.437 --> 00:06:27.600
what I'm gonna do is just go,

102
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.270
let's just clear this out a little bit.

103
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.480
So this is a cleared,

104
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.650
[LAUGH] very high-tech clearing
of the Slack channel here.

105
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.533
But what we can do now is we can actually
run our FoodFight command after we've

106
00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:47.030
added the app.

107
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.390
So we need to make the app available,
right now it's not here.

108
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.877
So you can see if I start typing
just FoodFight, it's not there and

109
00:06:55.877 --> 00:06:59.803
I need to add the app to a channel
in order to make it work, so

110
00:06:59.803 --> 00:07:04.000
the first thing is going into
the OAuth and permissions here.

111
00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.495
Why don't we make sure that
it's got all the right scopes?

112
00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:09.687
So, this first scope here, commands,

113
00:07:09.687 --> 00:07:13.625
is the one that's going to allow those
slash commands to be registered.

114
00:07:13.625 --> 00:07:17.300
So we're saying your bot can manage
commands, but the part that we don't have

115
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.485
yet is right now our bot wouldn't
be able to send any messages back.

116
00:07:20.485 --> 00:07:23.093
And we do want it to be able to do that,
so before we install it,

117
00:07:23.093 --> 00:07:26.420
because every time you change permissions,
you have to install it.

118
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.970
Let's add chat, right?

119
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.530
And that is gonna be everything
that this one needs.

120
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.350
So we can, we can save that.

121
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:37.847
And then now let's install
it to the workspace.

122
00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:42.646
Doesn't have a bot user to install.

123
00:07:42.646 --> 00:07:43.240
I know what it is.

124
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:43.740
Nevermind.

125
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:49.049
Let's, so here on the add display name.

126
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.170
So it's on App Home.

127
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:57.605
Scroll down to your
app's presence in Slack,

128
00:07:57.605 --> 00:08:04.570
and here we have to add
actual bot information.

129
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.273
So we're going to name
this bot food-fight,

130
00:08:07.273 --> 00:08:12.130
and we're going to give it a default
username of food-fight and add.

131
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.930
And then we can show it as always online.

132
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.990
That's a nice easy thing to do
if people want to see whether or

133
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.630
not the bot is working.

134
00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:21.370
And so up here now it says bot user added.

135
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.243
So now that we've added that bot user,
we can go back to this OAuth and

136
00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:29.620
permissions and
we can install the workspace.

137
00:08:33.273 --> 00:08:36.090
And now it's saying that it can do things.

138
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.032
It can send messages as food-fight,
and it can add shortcuts or

139
00:08:40.032 --> 00:08:42.300
slash commands that people can use.

140
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.466
And that's what we wanted to be able
to do, so we're gonna hit allow.

141
00:08:46.466 --> 00:08:47.371
Good, good.

142
00:08:49.512 --> 00:08:57.487
And next we're going to
minimize this window here,

143
00:08:57.487 --> 00:09:01.480
start typing Foodfight.

144
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.518
And now we've got Food Fight here.

145
00:09:04.518 --> 00:09:09.335
And you can see that whatever
we give it as the body of

146
00:09:09.335 --> 00:09:14.490
our command is what will
show up in the output here.

147
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.022
But note that it's only visible to you,
and

148
00:09:17.022 --> 00:09:21.812
that's because we can give feedback to the
user who ran the command using the body of

149
00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:24.226
what we returned from the slash command.

150
00:09:24.226 --> 00:09:26.810
But if we want to send
a message to everybody,

151
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.692
we're going to have to use Slack's API
to send a message as the bot.
