1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.533
So now that we've got the bot
responding to the slash command and kind

2
00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:09.069
of putting the details from the payload
from the user input back into chat,

3
00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:13.555
we wanna do one more thing before we
start dealing with saving that input.

4
00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:17.676
Which is, if somebody's not following our
process, which is pretty common on teams

5
00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:21.109
that I've been on, it's pretty
standard for somebody to kind of

6
00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.452
fly in from a meeting and say, hey,
I don't really like chocolate.

7
00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:28.502
If I can type.

8
00:00:32.062 --> 00:00:36.939
And in this case, they're starting
a food fight but in a work context,

9
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:39.884
they would be saying, hey, we need x or y.

10
00:00:39.884 --> 00:00:41.484
We need your help with this.

11
00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:44.100
We were working on x launch.

12
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.455
And the message flies into Slack,
and then who's responsible for

13
00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:50.330
keeping up on that, right?

14
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it the person who posted it is
supposed to be tracking that task?

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.510
Is it the team?

16
00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.197
It's hard to say.

17
00:00:56.197 --> 00:01:00.528
So what we really want is we want a way to
nudge that person to follow the process,

18
00:01:00.528 --> 00:01:04.880
which we could do by going in here and
being like, hey, please use the process.

19
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.598
But doing it this way it's a tiny conflict
even if it's not actually that tense or

20
00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:15.391
that big of a deal and it's still
just a little moment of you having to

21
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:20.100
kind of steal yourself to go tell
a co worker that they're wrong and

22
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.495
that they need to do
something a different way.

23
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:27.635
And that drains energy,
it uses up some of your spoons and

24
00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:31.470
leaves you with less in
the tank to do your job.

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.460
So a better way to do this is
to let a robot do it for us.

26
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.645
So we are going to add
a context menu shortcut, so

27
00:01:37.645 --> 00:01:42.100
that we can ask people without
having to type anything to them.

28
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.163
We just wanna be able,
instead of having to do it this way.

29
00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:51.030
We wanna open up this menu here,
and then ask them to do a thing.

30
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.840
So, to handle that,
we're going to go back to the browser.

31
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.901
And we're gonna get into our interactivity
and shortcuts menu again, and

32
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:02.160
we're gonna create a new one.

33
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.750
Now to create a new one,
we want this to work on messages.

34
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.402
So there's an option globally to just
hit that little lightning bolt icon and

35
00:02:08.402 --> 00:02:10.910
it'll give you options
of things you wanna do.

36
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.191
But in our case,
we're responding directly to a message, so

37
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:15.840
we want this to be on Messages.

38
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:21.640
So we're gonna hit that hit next and
then we are going to give it some details.

39
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.958
So the details that we want to
include our request to food fight and

40
00:02:25.958 --> 00:02:28.798
that's gonna be what shows up in the menu.

41
00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:33.484
And then we wanna have a short description
and this is going to be something that

42
00:02:33.484 --> 00:02:38.120
just kind of gives some details on
why you would use this context menu.

43
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.181
So, did your coworker just
offend your food sensibilities?

44
00:02:48.142 --> 00:02:52.060
Ask them to start a food fight so

45
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.954
you can lay into them for
eating incorrectly.

46
00:02:57.954 --> 00:03:02.778
And then as a callback ID, this can be
anything you want as long as it's unique,

47
00:03:02.778 --> 00:03:06.720
and I'm gonna call this one
start food fight nudge.

48
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.810
So I'm gonna hit Create and
then this is a little unintuitive.

49
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.648
You also have to hit Save or else it's
not going to do what you wanted to do.

50
00:03:14.648 --> 00:03:19.900
So, I have now saved and
I'm gonna come out here and reload and

51
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.648
then we can see that we've
got the request a food fight.

52
00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:26.130
I hit the wrong button.

53
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.812
Request a food fight, and
it'll say it didn't work and

54
00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:31.500
that's because we're not handling it yet.

55
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.090
So then we can open this up and
we're going to add a new case in here.

56
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.413
So we're gonna say case, and
it's going to be start food-fight-nudge,

57
00:03:42.413 --> 00:03:45.910
and then that'll have a break down below.

58
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.728
Then we can collapse these so

59
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:51.678
that we can focus on just the piece
that we're worried about.

60
00:03:51.678 --> 00:03:55.613
Great, the first thing we need is we need
to figure out what channel the nudge was

61
00:03:55.613 --> 00:03:56.210
sent from.

62
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.305
And that comes from our payload.

63
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:00.255
And the channel, and
then we'll grab the id.

64
00:04:01.695 --> 00:04:05.919
Next, we wanna know who was the person
that needs to be nudged because we're

65
00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:07.165
gonna tag them.

66
00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:12.940
So user id, and that's gonna
come out of the payload user id.

67
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.010
Then we need to know what the thread is
that we're in because what we're doing is

68
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.018
we're going to send this as a response to
their message in a thread as opposed to

69
00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:25.028
a public channel, which it's just a little
bit more subtle than like publicly

70
00:04:25.028 --> 00:04:27.668
blasting somebody for
not following the process.

71
00:04:27.668 --> 00:04:30.968
We do want it to be public so that people
can see that there is a process and

72
00:04:30.968 --> 00:04:32.133
it needs to be followed.

73
00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:35.122
But we don't need to do
the main channel,

74
00:04:35.122 --> 00:04:37.727
at user put them on blast kind of thing.

75
00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:40.644
So we're gonna grab
the thread timestamp and

76
00:04:40.644 --> 00:04:43.259
there are two places that can come from.

77
00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.912
If you are already in a thread, there's
gonna be the parent thread timestamp,

78
00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.101
and if you are replying to
a message with its first reply,

79
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:54.180
you're just gonna use
the message timestamp itself.

80
00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.828
So we're gonna check if
it's in a thread first,

81
00:04:56.828 --> 00:04:59.910
that's payload message thread timestamp.

82
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.035
And if that doesn't exist, we're gonna
get the payload message timestamp.

83
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:11.220
With those details, we can send our
message, so we're gonna await Slack API.

84
00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.757
We're gonna use the chat.postMessage, and

85
00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:18.309
what we wanna send is the channel, so
that's where it's going, the thread ts, so

86
00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:22.990
that it goes into the right reply,
and then we need to set up our text.

87
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.840
And so this is going to be just a nudge
to remind somebody that like, hey,

88
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.130
you should use the process.

89
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.650
So we'll say, hey and tag them and
that's their user id.

90
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.255
And again, these pointy boys
are a way of Slack letting you

91
00:05:41.255 --> 00:05:45.954
link in a not markdown, but
they call it markdown way.

92
00:05:45.954 --> 00:05:54.686
And we can say an opinion like this
one deserves a heated public debate.

93
00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:58.550
Run the and
then we wanna use some backticks here so

94
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.066
we're gonna escape them and
we'll say slash food fight.

95
00:06:03.066 --> 00:06:05.886
Wanna make this wrap.

96
00:06:05.886 --> 00:06:13.940
Food fight slash command in
a main channel to start one.

97
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.594
And I call out main channel because
slash commands don't work in threads,

98
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:19.110
which is a little bit of a pain.

99
00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.966
And it's a bit confusing because like
the "giphy" command does work in threads,

100
00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:26.406
but that's a special case that Slack.

101
00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:28.950
They just decided that that was
the way things were gonna be.

102
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.132
There's no way to make your
app work in a thread so

103
00:06:31.132 --> 00:06:33.750
you just have to nudge people
to go back to the main thread.

104
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.400
If they do try to use it in a thread,
it will tell them that.

105
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.640
So it's not a big deal,
it's just a thing to be aware of.

106
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.626
So I'm gonna save this, And now if I
go back out to the Slack instance,

107
00:06:46.626 --> 00:06:49.321
I'm gonna refresh by hitting Cmd+R,

108
00:06:49.321 --> 00:06:53.890
because sometimes it takes a second for
this to load.

109
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.100
I have two of these for
reasons I don't understand.

110
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.795
But the one that we just added
is the top one here, and

111
00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:05.549
that is going to show our message.

112
00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:09.363
So it created a thread, it tagged
the person who made the request, and

113
00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:10.795
it gives them a next step.

114
00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:14.988
So this is a nice little process nudge
that gives people a clue of what they

115
00:07:14.988 --> 00:07:16.797
should be doing next, right?

116
00:07:16.797 --> 00:07:20.926
So again, you're just trying
to take that mental burden,

117
00:07:20.926 --> 00:07:26.387
that emotional burden off of somebody of
having to go in and be the process cop.

118
00:07:26.387 --> 00:07:30.755
You want the bot to just gently and
very uniformly, same treatment for

119
00:07:30.755 --> 00:07:34.320
everybody, remind them that
processes are processes.

120
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.840
And this is the way that
work gets done here.
