WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.702
So this modal is what we
designed it to be, right?

2
00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:09.292
So we're able to say kind of
we define start a food fight.

3
00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:12.737
We've got a little
description of what it is and

4
00:00:12.737 --> 00:00:16.710
then what we need people to do,
including a hint here.

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.180
Because once I start typing here,
this goes away.

6
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.470
So you can add some details there and

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.070
then it gives you more info
about like what is required.

8
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.574
You can mark fields as
optional if you want, but

9
00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:29.650
in our case none of these are optional.

10
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.052
So at the moment, if I try to submit this,

11
00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:39.460
I am gonna say something like peanut
butter is a controversial thing.

12
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.742
So we'll say peanut butter and jalapenos

13
00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:53.201
Got to make sure you get
the diacritics right, are delicious.

14
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:56.442
And it's a jalapeno, so it's spicy.

15
00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:58.878
So I submit this, and it's going to fail,

16
00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:02.680
because we don't have any way of
handling this modal yet, right?

17
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.660
So it says, hey,
there was some trouble connecting.

18
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.808
That's because it tried to send something
and there was nothing to handle it.

19
00:01:08.808 --> 00:01:10.660
There's nothing registered for
it to send this to.

20
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:11.930
So it just times out.

21
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.200
It kind of flies into the void and
nothing comes back.

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.990
So it's like, I don't know,
maybe you didn't build this yet.

23
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.200
So, the next thing we need to
do is to actually build this.

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.400
We're gonna add interactivity here.

25
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.320
That means we're headed
back to the browser and

26
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.701
we're gonna full screen this, and
let's head into interactivity and

27
00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:40.106
shortcuts here on the left-hand side,
And we wanna turn this on.

28
00:01:40.106 --> 00:01:43.784
So, the way that interactivity works is
there are a lot of things that slack can

29
00:01:43.784 --> 00:01:45.840
do that it counts as interactivity.

30
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.309
If you click a button, if you respond to
a modal, if you run a contact shortcut or

31
00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:54.046
a bunch of other things,
it is going to call that interactivity and

32
00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:58.751
it sends it to one URL, which is actually
kinda nice in comparison to the commands.

33
00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:03.231
Because the commands you have
to add a URL for each one, and

34
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:07.085
that's useful for
separation of complex stuff.

35
00:02:07.085 --> 00:02:10.844
But in our case, it's kinda nice that it
all just goes to one place because we've

36
00:02:10.844 --> 00:02:12.627
got the switch commands to handle it.

37
00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:16.282
So we're just gonna use the exact
same URL here, actually.

38
00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:20.036
So I can let's see.

39
00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:22.010
I have this somewhere in here.

40
00:02:26.884 --> 00:02:33.945
Grab this,
drop it in here with the /api/slack.

41
00:02:37.093 --> 00:02:38.092
And we can save.

42
00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:45.903
Okay, what we're doing now is we're
sending it we can see these requests

43
00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:47.404
coming in as I submit.

44
00:02:47.404 --> 00:02:49.909
Probably a little easier to
see if I make this bigger.

45
00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:53.773
That we've got all these happening here.

46
00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:57.984
So submit, there's another one,
there's another one.

47
00:02:57.984 --> 00:03:02.158
And so we're sending these responses,
but because we're not actually handling

48
00:03:02.158 --> 00:03:05.560
the interactivity,
nothing is actually happening.

49
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.638
So to do that, we are going to head
back into the function here and

50
00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:18.637
we're gonna create a new function
underneath our handleSlashCommand.

51
00:03:18.637 --> 00:03:23.331
And this one's gonna be
called handleInteractivity.

52
00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:31.762
And this one also takes a payload and
that's gonna be the slack modal payload.

53
00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:38.295
And this one, we're gonna grab out
the callback id because we need that.

54
00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:43.792
And that's gonna be the payload,
callback id or

55
00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:47.823
the payload.view, callback id.

56
00:03:47.823 --> 00:03:51.082
And the reason that we're checking
both is that depending on whether or

57
00:03:51.082 --> 00:03:54.142
not we're sending a shortcut or
a modal, it changes a little bit.

58
00:03:54.142 --> 00:03:57.170
So this is just a quick fallback.

59
00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.538
That means we're not gonna have to
remember to change this later when we add

60
00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:01.509
additional pieces.

61
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:03.860
So let's set up a switch here.

62
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.513
We're gonna do this just like we
did in the handle slash command,

63
00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.860
where we're switching on the callback id.

64
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.433
And in the case of
the one we just created,

65
00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:17.000
our food fight modal,
we need to do some stuff.

66
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.600
So the stuff we wanna do
is let's get our data and

67
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.530
that's gonna be the payload
view state values.

68
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.955
These objects are large.

69
00:04:28.955 --> 00:04:33.104
Then to get our actual fields,
we wanna define the data that we need.

70
00:04:33.104 --> 00:04:35.677
So it's gonna be our opinion, and

71
00:04:35.677 --> 00:04:39.950
we'll come back and
actually set these our spice level.

72
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.970
And the submitter.

73
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.857
So I wanna know who
sent this opinion in so

74
00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:48.590
that if we have questions we
wanna follow up we can do that.

75
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.450
So to get these we
are gonna use this data.

76
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.650
So data.opinion_ block.

77
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.450
Remember I said that we
were using the id _ block?

78
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.510
Then we get to .opinion and
then the value.

79
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.290
So, this pattern just makes
things a little bit easier.

80
00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.679
There's no way to get
around the block really.

81
00:05:07.679 --> 00:05:10.804
And I don't know if
they need to be unique.

82
00:05:10.804 --> 00:05:14.231
So I just, or they do need to be
unique because otherwise they would,

83
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:15.899
you'd end up with kind of a mess.

84
00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:18.740
So this is the simplest
way I found to do it.

85
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.020
You can come up with whatever naming
convention you like, if you would like.

86
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.279
So, then we've got the spice level block,
the spice level itself,

87
00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:29.820
what the selected option is,
and then the value of that.

88
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.940
And finally, for the submitter,
that's not part of the form,

89
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.800
that's part of the original payload.

90
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.150
So, we can get the user and their name.

91
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.434
And what you could do if you were if
your team is all under like a single

92
00:05:43.434 --> 00:05:48.627
domain name, and you all sign into
Slack with your work email, and

93
00:05:48.627 --> 00:05:54.377
you all sign into Notion or GitHub or
whatever it is with your work emails,

94
00:05:54.377 --> 00:05:57.807
you can map these where
you can do a lookup for

95
00:05:57.807 --> 00:06:01.947
the user in the service
that you're searching for.

96
00:06:01.947 --> 00:06:07.625
We're not gonna do that today because
it's this is not like a work instance.

97
00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:11.924
And so, if somebody else joined and
they're using a Gmail account, we're not

98
00:06:11.924 --> 00:06:16.418
going to find their their email, because
there's no guarantee that they signed up

99
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:20.426
for Slack with the same email that
they signed up for Notion with, right?

100
00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:21.921
But it is an option.

101
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:27.591
It's what I did on a previous team because
everybody needed their at companyname.com.

102
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.211
And that allowed me to even have
people get updates in Notion for

103
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:33.412
something they'd created in Slack.

104
00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:36.178
It was a really nice workflow.

105
00:06:36.178 --> 00:06:41.018
But now that we've got this,
we will eventually save these,

106
00:06:41.018 --> 00:06:45.874
but for now we are going to just
send the details back to Slack.

107
00:06:45.874 --> 00:06:48.658
So we're going to use chat postMessage.

108
00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.751
We're gonna use a channel.

109
00:06:51.751 --> 00:06:56.440
And the channel that we are going
to use is our general channel.

110
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.920
So in this case I don't want to use
the channel where it was submitted.

111
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.260
I wanna use this channel's
detail directly.

112
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:10.560
So I'm gonna copy this channel id, and
then I'm gonna go back into here and

113
00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.262
post, oops, in quotes, paste that here.

114
00:07:14.262 --> 00:07:15.415
So that gives us our channel id.

115
00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:19.996
So anytime somebody starts a food fight,
it will post to the general channel.

116
00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:24.900
The way that I did this in previous
teams is if somebody made a request for

117
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:29.314
help with my team, it would post
in my team's public channel and

118
00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:34.499
tag the person who wrote it so that
they would know where we triaged issues.

119
00:07:34.499 --> 00:07:39.878
Next, we're gonna set up some text and
we'll say, dang y'all,

120
00:07:42.254 --> 00:07:46.368
And then we can put some emojis
in there because why not?

121
00:07:46.368 --> 00:07:51.338
And then we'll say we're gonna
use a specialty thing that

122
00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:55.203
that Slack does where
you can send like a tag.

123
00:07:55.203 --> 00:07:56.250
They do it like this.

124
00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.990
You put it in curly boy or
angle brackets like this.

125
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.561
And then you can add somebody
by either their username or

126
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:10.521
id and that'll turn into an actual
mention in the message and

127
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:16.565
then we can say just started a food
fight with a will do fields spice level.

128
00:08:19.836 --> 00:08:24.245
Take and
then I want this to have some new lines.

129
00:08:24.245 --> 00:08:29.152
So we'll just do some new
line fields there, and

130
00:08:29.152 --> 00:08:36.707
then I'm going to say fields.opinion,
and why don't we make that bold?

131
00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:43.461
And then we can add
a couple more new lines and

132
00:08:43.461 --> 00:08:47.174
just encourage everybody to discuss.

133
00:08:51.137 --> 00:08:53.571
We're gonna break under that.

134
00:08:55.132 --> 00:08:59.354
So, that is our basic setup here.

135
00:08:59.354 --> 00:09:04.149
And then if we want to
have a default case,

136
00:09:04.149 --> 00:09:07.029
we can just console log.

137
00:09:07.029 --> 00:09:14.219
We'll say no handler defined for payload.

138
00:09:14.219 --> 00:09:16.143
We'll actually,
we'll just send in the callback id.

139
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:25.307
And then we can return a status
of status code 400 and

140
00:09:25.307 --> 00:09:29.213
it'll be a body of this as well.

141
00:09:29.213 --> 00:09:34.954
So that it shows up oops, so that this
shows up on the screen for the person who

142
00:09:34.954 --> 00:09:41.071
posted it because again if something's
wrong like that you do want it to show up.

143
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:46.144
And then finally, down below our
switch case, we're gonna return

144
00:09:46.144 --> 00:09:51.840
a status code of 200, just like we did
in the other one with an empty body so

145
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.755
that Slack knows that we did,
in fact, respond to this request.

146
00:09:56.755 --> 00:10:01.297
Then to use it,
we are going to come down in here.

147
00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:07.471
And we're gonna check to see
if there's a body payload.

148
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.571
And if there is, we're gonna parse that.

149
00:10:10.571 --> 00:10:13.411
And this is sent as JSON, so

150
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:18.600
we'll do a JSON.parse and
get a body.payload.

151
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:25.061
And then return handleInteractivity and
pass in that payload.

152
00:10:25.061 --> 00:10:26.200
So let's give this a try.

153
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.586
Let's see how it's doing.

154
00:10:30.989 --> 00:10:33.298
So I'm gonna run my foodfight command.

155
00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:37.288
And then I wanna also show,
because we're checking for text,

156
00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:39.407
we can add the take right in here.

157
00:10:39.407 --> 00:10:44.715
So let's just say,

158
00:10:44.715 --> 00:10:52.529
Raisins are a garbage snack.

159
00:10:55.064 --> 00:10:57.801
So that'll get picked up and
automatically filled into that input,

160
00:10:57.801 --> 00:10:58.896
which is a nice way to do it.

161
00:10:58.896 --> 00:11:03.290
It lets people kind of move at the same
speed that they would normally type.

162
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:05.390
They just have to prefix
with that command.

163
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.460
And I don't know that this is
a particularly controversial thing to say.

164
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.060
I think this is probably
50-50 in the population.

165
00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.330
So we'll submit it.

166
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:13.640
And there we go.

167
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.520
It's now responding to the whole channel.

168
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.670
It tags my user and
says that I just started a food fight.

169
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:23.283
It includes the take that I put in, and

170
00:11:23.283 --> 00:11:26.770
it includes the spice level that I set for
it.

171
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:31.806
So, now we've got kind of a discussion
happening inside of slack.

172
00:11:31.806 --> 00:11:36.436
And this could be good enough for some
cases where if you just need a way you to,

173
00:11:36.436 --> 00:11:38.859
if somebody takes a particular action,

174
00:11:38.859 --> 00:11:42.515
have kind of an audit log of what
actions were taken and when.
