WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.013
We are going to actually start
saving this information, so

2
00:00:04.013 --> 00:00:07.010
we're going to start handling Notion.

3
00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.730
So this is a Notion database.

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.518
The way that this works is
that it's got a whole bunch of

5
00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:19.590
cool features for
managing and sharing data.

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.820
You can do different views and everything.

7
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.316
What we are gonna use it for is just
this kinda limited set of, we want items

8
00:00:27.316 --> 00:00:32.636
that have a few details in them,
who submitted it, what the status is,

9
00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:37.800
what the spice level is, and
we wanna show those in a progress board.

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.260
So to do in progress and complete.

11
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.362
This is set up to be sharable, and

12
00:00:45.362 --> 00:00:51.890
what we're going to do then is
we need to create a Notion app.

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.819
So we need an app here so that we can
read and write from this database.

14
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.298
So to do that,
we go to notion.com/my-integrations,

15
00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:10.200
and this allows you to create integration.

16
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.580
So as we did before, I'm gonna delete
this one and we'll start from scratch.

17
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.460
First, we're gonna choose
the right workspace.

18
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.180
We are going to use the, I created
one called Frontend Masters ChatOps.

19
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.790
If you created a new workspace,
make sure you actually select that.

20
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.680
Then we are gonna call it Food Fight.

21
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.720
And then we will run this
image command here, or

22
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.540
we will use the image
from the starter repo.

23
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.362
Submit, and then next,
we wanna go to capabilities and

24
00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:40.460
make sure that our bot can do all
the things that it needs to do.

25
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.700
So we're gonna make sure that it can read,
update, and insert content.

26
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.790
These are the only pieces
we really care about.

27
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.218
We're not gonna be doing
anything comments, and again,

28
00:01:48.218 --> 00:01:51.141
we're not gonna be trying to sync
users based on email or anything, so

29
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.280
we don't need any user information.

30
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.429
That is always something you can add
later, so feel free to kinda go with

31
00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.040
the minimum set of permissions to start,
so we can save that.

32
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.568
And now when we go over here and
refresh the page,

33
00:02:05.568 --> 00:02:09.810
and up in the top right,
there's this context menu.

34
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.830
Click that, go to Add connections,
and search for your connection.

35
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.450
There it is, and it's gonna have
access to this and all child pages.

36
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.080
We wanna be able to manage this database,
so that's what we want, so we can confirm.

37
00:02:28.093 --> 00:02:34.290
Now we need to get our Notion credentials
into the environment variables.

38
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.560
So to do that, we're going to
head into our integrations again,

39
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.322
get our secrets, and this is going to,

40
00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:49.960
I'm gonna copy this and
go back into my code here.

41
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.560
And we'll open up the .env and

42
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.660
we're gonna add a new one called
NOTION_SECRET and drop that in there.

43
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.048
And then we also are gonna
need the NOTION_DATABASE_ID.

44
00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:13.510
And the way that these work is that if you
look at the URL of your, make this bigger.

45
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.620
If you look at the URL of a database,
it's gonna have two hashy-looking numbers.

46
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.557
The first one here,
that's your database ID.

47
00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:27.670
And then this query string here,
v, that's not the piece you need.

48
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.158
So just copy this, and
then you can head back into your .env and

49
00:03:33.158 --> 00:03:36.380
put that in, save it, and close it.

50
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.094
So then what I'm gonna do is stop and
restart this again.

51
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.506
Because we've changed the environment, so

52
00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:49.130
we need to make sure that all of our
environment variables are being loaded.

53
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.330
That gives us a new hash for the live,
so I'm gonna go update that in Slack.

54
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.850
And that has to be updated
in two places now.

55
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.220
So we're gonna update this one and save.

56
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.573
And then we're gonna go into our
slash commands, edit the food fight,

57
00:04:11.198 --> 00:04:13.690
And change that one and save.

58
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.437
So now when we make calls to
the Notion API, they're going to have

59
00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:22.760
the proper permissions,
we're gonna be able to do that.

60
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.559
And because we changed our local dev,
that changes the hash,

61
00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:28.392
we have to update those URLs.

62
00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:35.790
Next up, we are going to create
a Notion helper function.

63
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.630
And this is gonna be very similar to
the Slack utils that we put together.

64
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.650
In this case, it will be for Notion.

65
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.354
So this src &gt; util &gt; notion
is already stubbed out, so

66
00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:54.894
you can just open up that file and
we will put everything in here.

67
00:04:54.894 --> 00:05:02.167
And this one is going to export
async function notionApi.

68
00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:06.614
And that's gonna have an endpoint,
and that's gonna be a string.

69
00:05:06.614 --> 00:05:10.387
And then it's gonna have a body, and

70
00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:14.417
that's gonna be an object by default.

71
00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:19.748
Next, we're gonna set up our response
that's going to await a fetch call.

72
00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:25.833
And that goes to https,
api.notion.com is the base,

73
00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:30.621
and then /v1 for
the version of the API that

74
00:05:30.621 --> 00:05:35.939
we're using, and
then we pass in the endpoint.

75
00:05:39.658 --> 00:05:44.447
It's going to be sent as a post,
and then we've got some headers.

76
00:05:44.447 --> 00:05:49.697
The headers that we need to include are an
accept header so that we get back JSON.

77
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:55.091
Then we wanna set up our authorization,
and

78
00:05:55.091 --> 00:06:00.234
that is also going to be a bearer
token just like we did with Slack,

79
00:06:00.234 --> 00:06:05.420
except this time we're using
process.env.NOTION_SECRET.

80
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.920
Then we want the Notion version.

81
00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.798
This is a required header from Notion
to let us know what version of

82
00:06:11.798 --> 00:06:13.660
API we're requesting.

83
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.594
The latest, I believe,

84
00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:21.639
that they show is this 22-06-28.

85
00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:25.487
And finally, we're gonna send the content
type to let Notion know that we

86
00:06:25.487 --> 00:06:28.291
are sending in JSON as well,
so application/json.

87
00:06:31.387 --> 00:06:34.443
And the body will be stringified JSON.

88
00:06:38.663 --> 00:06:43.868
And if something goes wrong,
we'll just catch that and

89
00:06:43.868 --> 00:06:46.976
throw it out to console.error.

90
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:54.858
Otherwise, we're gonna check if
there's no res or res.ok is false,

91
00:06:54.858 --> 00:07:00.440
then we're gonna console.log the error
as well, or the whole response.

92
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:08.370
And finally, we'll grab that data and
await res.json.

93
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.796
And we're just gonna,
because it might be undefined,

94
00:07:13.796 --> 00:07:17.870
we'll do one of these,
then we're gonna return our data.

95
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.976
So this is how we will get
data out of Notion, and

96
00:07:20.976 --> 00:07:24.471
this gives us the ability to send and
receive data, so

97
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:29.692
we'll be able to create new entries as
well as reading data from the databases.
