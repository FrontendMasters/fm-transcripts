00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.241
I'm Jason Lengstorf,

2
00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:04.599
I am very excited today to be
teaching everybody about ChatOps.

3
00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:09.455
I will specifically be teaching
about Slack and Notion today, but

4
00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:14.485
the concepts that we're gonna cover
will extend to any chat tool that

5
00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:19.793
has an API and any note taking or
project management tool that has an API.

6
00:00:19.793 --> 00:00:24.099
You'll be able to carry these
across to whichever one fits your

7
00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:25.816
particular work setup.

8
00:00:25.816 --> 00:00:31.351
I chose Slack because Slack seems
to be the most popular currently.

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.338
Well, I guess other than Microsoft Teams,
but I don't know Microsoft Teams,

10
00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:36.624
I haven't worked with it,
I've always worked with Slack.

11
00:00:36.624 --> 00:00:38.016
So we're gonna be going there.

12
00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:41.945
And then Notion,
mainly because Notion is what I use and

13
00:00:41.945 --> 00:00:45.631
it's what I use to manage
my teams in previous jobs.

14
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.451
But you could also apply these same
concepts to GitHub issues, to Jira,

15
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:55.112
to Linear, to Trello, or any of
the other tools that would allow you to

16
00:00:55.112 --> 00:00:58.292
keep track of your work and
incoming requests.

17
00:00:58.292 --> 00:01:01.070
So first, what is ChatOps?

18
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.916
Why does it exist, and
why are we doing it?

19
00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:08.646
So ChatOps is the idea of bringing
common tasks that your team does

20
00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:13.473
into your chat tool rather than
asking people to switch contexts.

21
00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:18.623
And the reason this is important is that,
what I've noticed at least is that,

22
00:01:18.623 --> 00:01:22.214
when you work on a team that
manages inbound requests,

23
00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:27.699
your Slack channel will often become the
place where people come to ask for things.

24
00:01:27.699 --> 00:01:28.574
And that makes sense.

25
00:01:28.574 --> 00:01:32.602
Well, a lot of us are on remote teams,
when you are discussing work,

26
00:01:32.602 --> 00:01:35.112
it is usually being
done in a team channel.

27
00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:40.117
And that work leads to ideas, tasks,
things that need to be followed up on.

28
00:01:40.117 --> 00:01:45.563
So the good part about this is that we've
got this very clear place to discuss and

29
00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:47.597
have ideas and brainstorm for

30
00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:51.432
what we should be doing
that'll get the best outcomes.

31
00:01:51.432 --> 00:01:56.203
The downside, though, is that then it sort
of turns Slack into a project management

32
00:01:56.203 --> 00:02:00.638
tool, where somebody has to keep track
of what messages were sent, whether or

33
00:02:00.638 --> 00:02:02.808
not somebody's followed up on them.

34
00:02:02.808 --> 00:02:08.297
And that typically leads to somebody
having to be sort of the channel admin or

35
00:02:08.297 --> 00:02:12.243
channel secretary,
who has to take these messages and

36
00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:16.908
transcribe them over or
transport them over to another medium.

37
00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:21.995
So in our case, when I was at Netlify,
what we had was effectively what

38
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:27.962
we call the week's kind of admin, we had
a funny name for it that I'm forgetting.

39
00:02:27.962 --> 00:02:30.592
But it's effectively the channel admin,
and

40
00:02:30.592 --> 00:02:33.029
their job was to do this
sort of admin work.

41
00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:36.952
If a question came into the Slack channel,
they had to go and

42
00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:42.145
take that request and translate it into
our to-do list, which was in Notion.

43
00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:44.946
They had to go make sure that
everybody got a response.

44
00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:48.511
They had to be looking at the requests
that were open, and making sure

45
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:52.880
that somebody was paying attention to them
that they'd been triaged and assigned.

46
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.487
And it was really everybody on
the team dreaded that week.

47
00:02:57.487 --> 00:03:01.534
And because there were six of us, so
it only came every month and a half or so.

48
00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:05.772
But that week was a terrible week
because you didn't get to do anything,

49
00:03:05.772 --> 00:03:09.398
you were just sort of monitoring
things and doing paperwork.

50
00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:13.424
And that's not what anybody, especially
if you're not hired specifically to

51
00:03:13.424 --> 00:03:16.260
do that job,
if your job isn't to be a project manager.

52
00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.289
Getting an assignment of being a project
manager for a week is usually something

53
00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:23.790
that drains people of energy, and
that's not what we want, right?

54
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.518
So ChatOPs is the idea of
trying to outsource as much of

55
00:03:28.518 --> 00:03:31.468
that busy work as we can to an app.

56
00:03:31.468 --> 00:03:38.524
So what we're trying to get to here
is compliance via convenience.

57
00:03:38.524 --> 00:03:40.398
When you have a process,

58
00:03:40.398 --> 00:03:44.690
you are attempting to get
people to follow that process.

59
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.977
So when my team had our Slack channel,
we would try things like saying,

60
00:03:48.977 --> 00:03:52.201
if you have a request,
you need to put it into Notion.

61
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:56.649
If you want a follow-up,
you need to put it here so that we see it.

62
00:03:56.649 --> 00:04:00.733
And people weren't unwilling to do it,
but they would forget.

63
00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:05.167
And when they forgot, that meant that
somebody on the team had to go and

64
00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:09.392
be the code cop and tell everybody,
you got to go do the thing.

65
00:04:09.392 --> 00:04:13.821
And that was a mild confrontation,
nobody was really angry or upset.

66
00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:18.338
But being put in a spot where you have
to tell somebody that they did something

67
00:04:18.338 --> 00:04:22.728
wrong is a tiny bit of tension that
drains your energy throughout the day.

68
00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:27.966
And so instead, what we were
aiming to do with this ChatOps and

69
00:04:27.966 --> 00:04:31.389
why we leaned this way
is that we made it so

70
00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.453
that it was easier to do the right
thing than to do the messy.

71
00:04:36.453 --> 00:04:39.980
Like drop a request in Slack and
then hope somebody follows up on it.

72
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.206
Because what we're hoping for is that
people want to do something that is

73
00:04:44.206 --> 00:04:46.854
convenient, they want
to do the easy thing.

74
00:04:46.854 --> 00:04:50.795
And if you can give them a shortcut
that is the correct thing to do,

75
00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:55.096
it's the most compliant thing that
they can do with the given process,

76
00:04:55.096 --> 00:04:57.263
then they'll take that shortcut.

77
00:04:57.263 --> 00:05:01.300
Not out of adherence to the rules or
anything, but

78
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.799
because it's the fastest and
least painful thing that they can do.

79
00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:12.099
This was a huge win for us when we
put this in place because it meant

80
00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.910
that we were able to actually
remove the admin rotation and

81
00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.136
let people focus instead on doing
the job they were hired to do.

82
00:05:22.136 --> 00:05:27.147
And so this was a really powerful
thing that we were able to build.

83
00:05:27.147 --> 00:05:33.211
And I wanna, This is one of

84
00:05:33.211 --> 00:05:38.274
those things that, I feel like it's easy
to brush this off as this isn't important.

85
00:05:38.274 --> 00:05:42.518
Internal tooling is something that we're
seeing happen more and more in companies.

86
00:05:42.518 --> 00:05:45.985
We see people talk about the value and
need for internal tooling,

87
00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:48.581
we're seeing internal
tooling teams stand up.

88
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:52.624
And I'm really, really excited about that
because that hasn't always been the case.

89
00:05:52.624 --> 00:05:56.331
In a lot of companies,
internal tools are seen as,

90
00:05:56.331 --> 00:06:01.173
they're not aligned with
the priorities of the company, right?

91
00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:04.639
Well, why are we building software for
us instead of for our customers?

92
00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.428
And you get these arguments
that the tools we're building,

93
00:06:08.428 --> 00:06:12.598
it's not the best use of engineering
time or something like that.

94
00:06:12.598 --> 00:06:15.406
But the problem is that nobody
wants to be a process cop.

95
00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:20.740
Nobody wants to be the one who is
monitoring other people's behavior and

96
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.695
then having to nudge them gently to do the
right thing when they miss the process.

97
00:06:26.695 --> 00:06:30.328
Because again,
people aren't doing this work to be mean,

98
00:06:30.328 --> 00:06:35.716
they're not skipping your process because
they don't like you or don't respect you.

99
00:06:35.716 --> 00:06:39.596
It's because everybody's busy and every
team has a lot of different processes.

100
00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:44.090
And it's very easy to forget which team
has which process, where you're supposed

101
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.571
to put things if you want this team
to look at it versus that team.

102
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.792
And that forgetfulness is not malice,
it's just everybody's busy and

103
00:06:50.792 --> 00:06:52.656
there's a lot of things to keep track of.

104
00:06:52.656 --> 00:06:56.461
So automating things allows to
get rid of the process cop,

105
00:06:56.461 --> 00:06:59.030
and instead put in place a process bot.

106
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:03.274
And the process bot is impartial,
it's very level, and

107
00:07:03.274 --> 00:07:08.235
it's not accusatory,
it's just you saying, this is a process.

108
00:07:08.235 --> 00:07:11.239
And if you do something that
doesn't follow the process,

109
00:07:11.239 --> 00:07:14.256
the bot just reminds you, hey,
you gotta do the process.

110
00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:16.979
And you're making it very friendly and
easy for

111
00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:22.101
people to then follow that process, which,
again, they're not doing it out of spite.

112
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:24.963
If they are, you've got a whole different
problem, but for the most part,

113
00:07:24.963 --> 00:07:26.589
people aren't doing things out of spite.

114
00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:28.641
They're doing things because they forgot,

115
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.557
because doing it according to
the process takes a lot more time.

116
00:07:31.557 --> 00:07:34.888
They've got a context switch and
get out of the chat app, and

117
00:07:34.888 --> 00:07:38.364
then open up the project management
app and fill out this form.

118
00:07:38.364 --> 00:07:41.393
And it just gets them, you don't
have time for that, so you're like,

119
00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:43.477
I'll do it later, right,
I'll do that later.

120
00:07:43.477 --> 00:07:46.472
And then you don't deal with it later, but
then you still need that work done, so

121
00:07:46.472 --> 00:07:47.990
you end up relying on the Slack message.

122
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.918
So you just want a way to
make things more friendly and

123
00:07:51.918 --> 00:07:55.131
more accessible for
the rest of your team so

124
00:07:55.131 --> 00:08:00.325
that they can participate in the process
in a way that feels natural.

125
00:08:00.325 --> 00:08:05.112
It's the most convenient thing,
because again, we're going for compliance

126
00:08:05.112 --> 00:08:09.986
via convenience, not through being strict
or draconian about your processes.

127
00:08:09.986 --> 00:08:12.378
You don't want anybody to
have to be a process cop.
