1
00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:04.672
That'll let us get items, and
we'll look at that in a minute.

2
00:00:04.672 --> 00:00:07.426
But what we're gonna do now
is we're going to save items.

3
00:00:07.426 --> 00:00:13.452
So we're gonna create another
helper called saveItem,

4
00:00:13.452 --> 00:00:17.479
and that is going to also be a NewItem.

5
00:00:17.479 --> 00:00:21.189
And this one is also gonna
access the notionApi.

6
00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.257
So we await notionApi.

7
00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:27.481
And this time, we're posting to pages.

8
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:29.479
So we wanna set the parent.

9
00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:33.985
That parent is going to be the database_id
because we want this to show up in our

10
00:00:33.985 --> 00:00:34.683
database.

11
00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:41.051
So process.env.NOTION_DATABASE_ID.

12
00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:44.058
And then what we're gonna
pass in is properties.

13
00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:47.669
Properties, Will have the opinion.

14
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.084
That opinion is going to include a title.

15
00:00:55.084 --> 00:00:59.229
That title is an array that has
an object in it, that has text.

16
00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:05.161
And then it has another object that is
content, and that's the item.opinion.

17
00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:13.731
Then we need, The spiceLevel.

18
00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:22.902
Like I said, these objects get
a little big, but that's okay.

19
00:01:22.902 --> 00:01:27.013
Let me do a select, and then we're gonna
set the name, and that is item.spiceLevel.

20
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.421
And finally, we want the submitter.

21
00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:36.142
And that submitter is gonna be rich_text.

22
00:01:36.142 --> 00:01:40.311
And that is very similar
to the way the title works.

23
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:46.314
You pass in an array, and then you
pass in objects that have content.

24
00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:50.147
And this one,
we're gonna do a little bit of formatting.

25
00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:56.628
So we're gonna do an @ and
item.submitter, On Slack just to kinda

26
00:01:56.628 --> 00:02:01.798
link back to who sent this in so that
the people triaging can go and set it up.

27
00:02:08.296 --> 00:02:14.372
And with that set, we're gonna say,
if anything didn't work with that call,

28
00:02:14.372 --> 00:02:17.371
then we're going to console.log it.

29
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:20.632
But otherwise, there's not really anything
for us to do, we just wanna save that.

30
00:02:22.757 --> 00:02:27.906
To actually use this,
we can head into our top level function,

31
00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:31.904
and we're going to edit
the foodfight-modal.

32
00:02:31.904 --> 00:02:34.967
And we've already got our details here,
and

33
00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:38.199
these match that NewItem
type that we created.

34
00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:44.836
So all we have to do to make this work
is await savItem and pass in our fields.

35
00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:49.437
In here,

36
00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:54.989
see how I wrapped this inside of opinion
instead of making it its own thing.

37
00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.922
So let me go back up here and
just fix that typo.

38
00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:04.100
So now we have top-level properties.

39
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.091
We've got properties,
opinion, spiceLevel, and

40
00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:10.617
submitter instead of nesting them
in that weird way that I did.

41
00:03:10.617 --> 00:03:11.861
So we can save that.

42
00:03:14.244 --> 00:03:18.870
And we'll come back out here and
try this one more time.

43
00:03:22.783 --> 00:03:30.019
And we'll say,
Pop Rocks make any dessert better.

44
00:03:33.051 --> 00:03:35.110
Okay, medium.

45
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.250
There we go, and
it showed up somewhere here.

46
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.081
Here it is.

47
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:45.867
So now we've got a communication
directly from Slack into Notion, because

48
00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:51.041
whenever we run this command, we're able
to gather the details out of the modal.

49
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.264
Package them up in a way
that Notion understands, and

50
00:03:54.264 --> 00:03:58.201
then send it through to Notion so
that the team can come and look and

51
00:03:58.201 --> 00:04:01.657
see that there are things
that need discussion, right?

52
00:04:01.657 --> 00:04:03.343
This is great,
this is exactly what we want.

53
00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.423
And if we need more details,

54
00:04:05.423 --> 00:04:11.238
we can also see that my user is the user
that submitted this particular opinion.

55
00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:14.171
So if there's any
follow-up that's necessary,

56
00:04:14.171 --> 00:04:18.807
like if somebody wants to clarify what
flavor of Pop Rocks, they know to find me,

57
00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:22.373
and it's not just kind of a mystery
as to where this came from.
