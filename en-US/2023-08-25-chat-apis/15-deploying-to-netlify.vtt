WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.472
So the only thing that we have left
to do here is actually deploy it,

2
00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:10.474
which will give us the ability
to see this chron job running.

3
00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:12.492
So I'm gonna stop here and

4
00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:18.007
I'm going to see all these things
that I've got, commit everything.

5
00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:23.440
Git commit,
let me check out a new branch actually.

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.180
We'll call this a workshop.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:32.266
Okay, then I'm gonna git
commit everything and

8
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.550
say working chatops flow.

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.933
We're gonna git push origin and workshop.

10
00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:47.500
Okay, so this is pushed up to
my particular branch here.

11
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.885
And then if I go into Netlify and

12
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:58.380
look at my app, I've just deployed.

13
00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:03.010
Let's see if I get past
all my starred stuff.

14
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.930
Here's my chat ops.

15
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.850
And that was deployed at 9:26.

16
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.750
So I think this is set up on
the right one, but it's not using

17
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.590
the branch that I want cuz I just
pushed to my workshop branch.

18
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.920
So, I'm gonna change that here
to where right now it's on Main.

19
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.590
I'm gonna change it to Workshop.

20
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.780
I'm gonna save.

21
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.971
And then, I can go to My Deploys,
and we'll deploy the site so

22
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:35.250
that it uses the Workshop branch.

23
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.639
And we can see up here that it's now using
that Workshop branch when it deploys.

24
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.770
So it's deploying our site,
it's got our functions, and

25
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.380
it should say that we have
a scheduled function.

26
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.168
And if I go and
look at my function setup here,

27
00:01:56.168 --> 00:02:01.640
we can see that we've got this one
set up as a scheduled function now.

28
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.130
And it should run in one minute.

29
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.360
So any second now,
we should see that actually execute.

30
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.786
I missed a step, actually,
because remember,

31
00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:16.300
we've got all those
environment variables locally.

32
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.270
So we need to actually put those
environment variables up on Netlify.

33
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.341
And because we've got the .env file,

34
00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.820
this is actually Just
delightfully straightforward.

35
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.309
I can run ntl env import and
then grab the .env file,

36
00:02:34.546 --> 00:02:40.450
And that pulls in all those details,
which I will hide here.

37
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.394
And then we're going to go back out and
we're just gonna rebuild one more time now

38
00:02:44.394 --> 00:02:47.470
that we've got those environment
variables because if I go and

39
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.320
look at my settings here,
now we'll see that they're actually there.

40
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.670
So they weren't there before.

41
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.388
That's why it wasn't working.

42
00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:56.609
So we'll trigger one more deploy,

43
00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.840
only takes a few seconds because
this is just a couple of functions.

44
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.850
We don't have a lot of advanced
anything going on in this.

45
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.260
All right, that build is complete.

46
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.110
Head back out to our functions we
can see that our reminder is here.

47
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.280
It's scheduled to run every minute
next execution in one minute.

48
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.340
So we can collapse this down, hide this.

49
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.700
And in a minute here we should
see our function execute.

50
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.650
There we go.

51
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.862
So now we have a Notion bot, or a Notion
app, I should say, and a Slack app that

52
00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:37.540
allow us to run slash commands to
add something to our task queue.

53
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.219
We've got a shortcut that allows
us to remind other people about

54
00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.840
how to follow that process and
to use the slash command.

55
00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.203
We've got the ability to sync
those slash command entries and

56
00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:49.699
save that input to Notion.

57
00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:54.625
And then we've got the ability for Notion
to take that input and send it back using

58
00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:58.899
a cron job so that the team is able to
see what they're on the hook for and

59
00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:02.248
make sure they stay on top
of those incoming requests.
