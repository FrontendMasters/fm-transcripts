00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.086
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's think
about what we're building here.

2
00:00:02.086 --> 00:00:04.458
So we can select a project.

3
00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:09.138
But we can't unselect a project.

4
00:00:09.138 --> 00:00:12.913
So what if you're like, I don't really
wanna do anything with this yet.

5
00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.495
Well think about what will you do.

6
00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:22.487
Capture the click and
we would set select the project to no.

7
00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:27.172
If I were thinking about this,

8
00:00:27.172 --> 00:00:32.044
click, we'll just go cancel.

9
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.401
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Notice it's not
super happy so we'll hop over here.

10
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:45.843
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm actually
super surprised that worked,

11
00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:49.177
considering that crazy parameter soup.

12
00:00:49.177 --> 00:00:54.253
So we'll go cancel,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

13
00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:59.605
then what I could do is I could just
say this selectProject equals null.

14
00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:04.201
But if you're going to mutate state I
think it's good to do it in a single

15
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:04.750
place.

16
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.406
So what I'm then going to do
instead of just manually this,

17
00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:12.925
I'm going to defer this back to,
select project.

18
00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:16.584
So this is strictly a preference for
me, but as I'm trying to,

19
00:01:16.584 --> 00:01:21.281
it's a mutating state in adjusting
properties even presentation properties,

20
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:24.198
is that I try to isolate
those into a single place.

21
00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.422
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes?

22
00:01:26.422 --> 00:01:27.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe a simple thing.

23
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.229
But first of all, I think you're
calling the selectProject function,

24
00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.078
not selectedProject.

25
00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:32.278
And you're,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Thank you.

26
00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:33.236
PEAR programming for the win.

27
00:01:33.236 --> 00:01:34.346
Air five, okay.

28
00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:37.978
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Second, I'm wondering why
you didn't just call selectProject and

29
00:01:37.978 --> 00:01:38.798
pass it a null?

30
00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:41.840
Maybe would that give an error or
something I'm just not seeing?

31
00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:45.106
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: From here?

32
00:01:45.106 --> 00:01:46.424
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah just make it simple.

33
00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:49.071
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So you could,
and that's a good question.

34
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:53.451
It's like why didn't I just
call select project directly?

35
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:59.538
So back to personal preference is
that I like code to be descriptive.

36
00:01:59.538 --> 00:02:02.947
In terms of when I call this
what's going to happen.

37
00:02:02.947 --> 00:02:07.870
Well you're going to cancel something,
what this also does is it sets the stage

38
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.672
for possibly I need to
do additional things.

39
00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:15.327
And so typically if I basically
couple that action to a single thing,

40
00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:18.549
then I typically cannot
extend it beyond that.

41
00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.477
And so therefore when I click
the cancel button, I know hey,

42
00:02:22.477 --> 00:02:25.865
a cancel method is being called and
so makes sense but

43
00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:29.814
if I said click cancel and
also just order pizza or whatever.

44
00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:34.893
There's a disconnect there, so I like to
reduce friction by when I click this, this

45
00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:39.774
event that I'm calling matches up to the
action and the context of where I'm at.

46
00:02:39.774 --> 00:02:42.736
More importantly, I said it allows for
additional sequencing.

47
00:02:42.736 --> 00:02:45.077
That maybe I want to cancel this but

48
00:02:45.077 --> 00:02:49.451
maybe I need to navigate somewhere else or
something like that.

49
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.065
Very good question.

50
00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:53.790
Let's see if I blow this up,

51
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.616
isTrusted is true, wait hold on.

52
00:02:58.616 --> 00:03:01.409
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah [LAUGH],

53
00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.640
that's why that was actually working.

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.096
I'm like,
this just doesn't make any sense.

55
00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:06.354
There we go.

56
00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:09.294
All right, so we've updated this.

57
00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:11.654
Let's go back, there we go.

58
00:03:11.654 --> 00:03:17.304
And if I go to Cancel, we're at a Null.

59
00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:21.092
But again, not super duper helpful.

60
00:03:21.092 --> 00:03:24.675
I think we can do better.
