00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:07.555
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So now what we can do,
because this is an observable stream,

2
00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:14.000
you can

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.480
attach some parameters to this,
or you can filter some things.

4
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.417
So for instance, we can go pipe.

5
00:00:23.697 --> 00:00:25.420
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
then from here, let's go filter.

6
00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:37.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This may break
on the import, hopefully not.

7
00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:46.874
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And we could see
that if we go back to our JSON here,

8
00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:52.030
that we have an approved property here.

9
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.930
So some are approved, some are not.

10
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.120
And so what we can do, because I
can't get this import to work right,

11
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.880
I'm just going to show
what this would look like.

12
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.820
You can say, rather,

13
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.160
result.,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Approved.

14
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.350
And it will just say, anything that is
approved, it will allow to go through.

15
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:29.020
Okay, so with that said,
let's do the short way here.

16
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.614
So this.projects =,

17
00:01:32.614 --> 00:01:38.369
this.projectsService.all().

18
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.320
So right now it's saying,
not an observable, what do we do?

19
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.290
Well, let's go here and
let's turn this into an observable.

20
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.680
So we're going to recast this.

21
00:01:57.955 --> 00:01:59.530
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I totally
don't know why I did that.

22
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.730
I think the universe is just
laughing at me right now.

23
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.110
Get up there.

24
00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:15.440
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

25
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.860
I think we can salvage this.

26
00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:22.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

27
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.319
What we'll also do by convention,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: When

28
00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.002
you have an observable stream,
typically you put a dollar sign on

29
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:36.870
the end of it to indicate that this
is Projects, but it's a stream.

30
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.110
So we'll go down here.

31
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.260
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Put a dollar sign
on the end of this, there we go.

32
00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:51.366
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go into
our project's component, and

33
00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:57.940
where we are iterating over this,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Is

34
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.860
project of projects.

35
00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:13.155
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll do is,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We

36
00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:15.685
need to add in an additional
pipe which is async.

37
00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:17.775
So saying that this is
an asynchronous service.

38
00:03:17.775 --> 00:03:20.355
So what it will do is it's
passing in the observable.

39
00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:25.323
And that asynch pipe is actually taking
that observable, unwrapping it and

40
00:03:25.323 --> 00:03:26.960
making that available.
