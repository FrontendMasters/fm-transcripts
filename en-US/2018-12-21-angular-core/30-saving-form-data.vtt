00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.760
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's build out
the rest of the project components.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.791
So we've done the form.

3
00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:13.621
We're capturing the selected object,
binding it to the form using ng-model.

4
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:22.183
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We know
that we can delete a project.

5
00:00:22.183 --> 00:00:27.326
But we haven't set anything up to

6
00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:33.211
create a project or update a project.

7
00:00:37.058 --> 00:00:38.795
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
we'll just flesh these out.

8
00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:46.430
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And I'm just going
to copy this for the sake of time.

9
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.914
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
we wanna create, obviously create.

10
00:00:51.914 --> 00:00:57.852
We're going to send in the entire project,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Like so.

11
00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:02.890
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
typically what I will do,

12
00:01:05.618 --> 00:01:07.612
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: For these, definitely,

13
00:01:07.612 --> 00:01:10.521
is we'll go ahead and resetProject.

14
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:21.617
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so
this is a fairly straightforward call.

15
00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:24.626
This is just going to be update.

16
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:27.644
And when it comes in,
getProjects, resetProjects.

17
00:01:27.644 --> 00:01:30.751
So there are some ways that you
can kind of extract this out,

18
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.751
make it a little more sophisticated.

19
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:38.057
But you could have just a reset
everything or whatever.

20
00:01:38.057 --> 00:01:40.194
But for now, we'll just leave this here.

21
00:01:40.194 --> 00:01:45.933
And when we call saveProject,
what we're going to

22
00:01:45.933 --> 00:01:51.419
do is,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If there's

23
00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:56.829
a project.id, or rather,
we'll check if project.id

24
00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.396
is not null,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then

25
00:02:02.396 --> 00:02:07.029
we'll call this updateProject,
send that in.

26
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.690
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: createProject.

27
00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's the opposite
of what you want, I think.

28
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.353
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did I do that?

29
00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:31.606
So if it's not null, then the id
exists and you wanna update it.

30
00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:34.918
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's checking if
the project.id doesn't exist.

31
00:02:34.918 --> 00:02:35.448
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did I mess that up?

32
00:02:35.448 --> 00:02:37.241
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It would evaluate to true.

33
00:02:40.954 --> 00:02:45.370
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes, so if it does
exist, you would wanna call it big so

34
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.339
good call.

35
00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:51.763
Okay, and so
now let's just see what happens.

36
00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:53.497
TEST PROJECT.

37
00:02:53.497 --> 00:02:58.504
TEST, we'll set this to
some arbitrary number.

38
00:02:58.504 --> 00:03:02.967
Let's say you got super lucky and
it was 38%, and they're like you're done,

39
00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:05.062
you don't have to do any more than this.

40
00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:10.016
Then save here, so
notice it went, it refreshed it.

41
00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:16.767
But in order to make sure this is indeed
a real deal, scroll down to the bottom.

42
00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:20.645
You can see here, done deal.

43
00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:25.504
Now one thing I would say is that
typically it's tempting working with

44
00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:29.636
JSON Server or whatever to have
let's make ids be numbers.

45
00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:31.153
That doesn't scale very well.

46
00:03:31.153 --> 00:03:35.166
So even when you're 1, 2, 3, 4,

47
00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:39.920
make them strings for
this reason right here.

48
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.711
Is that their had all numbers then you
got a JSON Server some real data base and

49
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.342
you get these strings back.

50
00:03:46.342 --> 00:03:49.687
So then from here, we can go and

51
00:03:49.687 --> 00:03:54.854
we'll just go hea,
add some different stuff.

52
00:03:54.854 --> 00:04:00.275
Let's set this to we're
going the extra mile, save.

53
00:04:00.275 --> 00:04:07.128
Now, you'll notice here, and this is what
we're gonna talk about in the next module.
