&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I need to make one
additional piece of commentary,

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.590
here, that could trip you up.

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.936
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: When you're using ngModel,
so

4
00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:13.210
this is specifically
a template driven form.

5
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.080
So for most basic use cases,
this is completely fine, that

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.850
if you use an ngModel,
that you must have a name property

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.960
on that element or it will fall apart.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.160
Something under the hood allows
angular to connect that.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.760
So you notice when I was on the slider,
that I forgot to put the name on it.

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.070
Everything else was working but
that slider wasn't responding.

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.520
So in order for ngModel to hook into and

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.640
bind to a form element,
it needs a name property.

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.050
Which, really, the reason being, it's cuz
it's attaching a top level form controller

14
00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.020
to the entire form, and then,
essentially, keeping track of everything.

15
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.240
And if that goes in a bad spot,
then it will capture that.
