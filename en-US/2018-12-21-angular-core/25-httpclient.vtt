00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.060
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go ahead and

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.370
we're going to re-factor
this to use the http client.

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.590
So let's do first things first,
make sure that

4
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.290
in the core data module that we've
included the HttpClientmodule.

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.630
Now, what you also need to do and
this is what we wanna write is that in

6
00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.750
your top level up module, we need to

7
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.860
import HttpClient module as well.

8
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.270
All right, so now that we have the imports
in both places, let's go ahead and

9
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.410
hop back into our project service and
let's start to build the cell.

10
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.650
So we're gonna go ahead and delete this
local structure, we don't need it.

11
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.581
And we are going to import the http
client via dependency injection or

12
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:04.089
we're going to make it
available in our constructor.

13
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.820
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Via
dependency injection, httpClient.

14
00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.320
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Make
sure I have the right one.

15
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.590
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

16
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.450
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We
can also get rid of that.

17
00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:30.000
And because we're using a constructor
assignment by putting private on here,

18
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.840
this makes the service available for

19
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.500
consumption in the rest of the service or
class.

20
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:50.860
And so
we'll go return this.httpClient.get and

21
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.920
from here, we need to put our end point.

22
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:59.709
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so we're going
to break this up into two pieces

23
00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.099
using a string literal.

24
00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:07.413
So typically what I'll do is at the top
of the class is I'll create a string

25
00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:13.000
that represents the model that I'm
working with, so in this case projects.

26
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.930
And so we'll go here and we'll put model,
but then we need to put in our base URL.

27
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.234
So
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If you look in your

28
00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:32.070
packets.json there is, not the lock.

29
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.425
We have installed json server which
then spins up a db.json file.

30
00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:45.060
So it actually take that json file and
converts it into a rest endpoint.

31
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.980
So if we go to the browser and
we go to, in this case localhost 3000,

32
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.370
we can see that we have
the server running.

33
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.250
And if we go to projects, you can see
that we have our project structure.

34
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.170
So I'm gonna go back here and
I'm just going to copy the base URL.

35
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.450
And then in our code, let me just
swap this disk around, we'll go here.

36
00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:16.720
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And I'm going
to create in the project service,

37
00:03:22.717 --> 00:03:23.995
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: A base URL constant,

38
00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.630
we'll just paste this in.

39
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.600
And then from here, we paste in BASE_URL.

40
00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.313
Now, what you could do is there's
an environments file that

41
00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:41.860
you could tuck it in there, if you wanted,
but for now to keep it simple,

42
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.110
I'm going to keep it in
the project service, so base URL.

43
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.900
By putting it an environments file which
you could do is like if you are in dev

44
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.340
use a dev url, if you are in prod,
use a production url.

45
00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.800
So we'll take off the typing here and
make sure that it's this.model.

46
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:03.582
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Like so.

47
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.067
And so when we call all,
it's going to basically do a git

48
00:04:10.067 --> 00:04:15.710
request to this base URL,
plus forward-slash projects.

49
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:20.090
So now we need to actually consume this
data, so back into our projects component.

50
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.917
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You'll notice here
that it's saying that this is not of type

51
00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:29.500
of an observable of an array of project.

52
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.620
So we're gonna do a couple of tweaks here.

53
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.260
I'm gonna show you kind of the long
way around on how to get this data.

54
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.220
So because we're doing an asynchronous
version, so this is the long way.

55
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.537
And then we'll see kind of the short way.

56
00:04:45.537 --> 00:04:50.053
We need to subscribe to
this observable stream

57
00:04:50.053 --> 00:04:53.987
which is then going to
give us a result and

58
00:04:53.987 --> 00:04:59.100
then from here we can say
this.projects = result.

59
00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:05.340
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,
let's save the cell.

60
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.520
Make sure that,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Everything is running.

61
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.830
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You notice here one,
two, three, and five.

62
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:28.100
Well, let's verify that if we go
to dv.json in the server folder,

63
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.960
that is indeed what we were doing.

64
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.480
In fact, let's go down here to projects,

65
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.629
Project HOLLA, let's save this.

66
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.040
Because this is in memory I need
to stop the server, restart it,

67
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.110
let this run and then when this refreshes,
then it better be Project Holla or

68
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.902
I'm gonna be quite cross.

69
00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:04.030
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Boom, there we go.
