00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.750
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So if we go over
to here apps, libs nothing is here,

2
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:13.370
so let's start to build this out.

3
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.120
So the first thing that we're going
to do if you have an nx workspace is

4
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.422
we need an application to put into it
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,

5
00:00:28.639 --> 00:00:29.608
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Before we generate

6
00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:32.920
the application though,
let's do one thing real quick.

7
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.930
And this is just one of these niggly
things that you would have to do it once

8
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.265
or twice and you'd be like,
this is super annoying.

9
00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:43.180
And you would just catch it and you'd be,
man, if I could just go back in time or

10
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.880
you would fix it, and
then you'd have to go fix everything.

11
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.000
If you go to nx.json,
they attach an npmScope to your projects.

12
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.420
And so angular hyphen core,
hyphen workshop, that's a little verbose.

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.630
So let's change that to just workshop.

14
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.880
So already I think you
got your money's worth,

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.860
because this is super frustrating when
you start generating a bunch of stuff.

16
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.076
And your mpm scope is something
totally weird or not descriptive.

17
00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:13.339
One other things that we will do
is just a bit of housekeeping.

18
00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:18.489
These are the things that
after doing this ten times

19
00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:26.031
I wish I had done initially is we
are going to set our default preprocessor,

20
00:01:26.031 --> 00:01:30.602
ng config schematics, nrwl/schematics.

21
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.415
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Component.styleext
scss.

22
00:01:47.046 --> 00:01:54.590
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now what this will
do is if we go into our angular.json.

23
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.700
So this is now the main control panel for
everything.

24
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.030
Down at the bottom,
you will see that schematics and

25
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.590
the style extension is basically SaaS,
which I think is a much better option.

26
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.460
If you wanted to go with straight CSS,
not a problem, but typically being able to

27
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.610
just nest that and
have hierarchical styling is a huge plus.

28
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.566
All right, so let's go ahead and
generate our first application.

29
00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:30.810
So, ng app, or

30
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.140
ng g app, and
we're going to call this dashboard.

31
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.210
We're gonna attach some
additional flags so, routing.

32
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.590
So we wanna generate this application
with routing baked into it.

33
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.980
In some cases, you may want to generate
an application where there is not a route,

34
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.430
it's just a single page.

35
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.270
And so you would leave this off.

36
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.400
What we're also going to do, this is
another kind of a super annoying thing

37
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.120
is that when you generate a component,
you have a selector prefix.

38
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.470
And you kind of want to control that.

39
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.010
It would generate, I think in this case
because our work space is workshop,

40
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.266
then it would say well okay your prefix
is workshop which is kind of annoying.

41
00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:19.050
So- p or- p for prefix equals app and

42
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.250
I am just going to go ahead and
I'm gonna set this here,

43
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.630
so just to show that, let's say,
you had not set the default.

44
00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.490
You could still do --style and
just set this to scss.

45
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.490
Now one of the things you can do is a -d,
or you can do --dry run.

46
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.416
And what this does is
it runs it in a vacuum.

47
00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:52.179
So this is really,
really handy when you're like,

48
00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:57.324
I want to generate this thing but
I don't know what's going to happen.

49
00:03:57.324 --> 00:04:02.205
And so being able to just quickly say,
okay, well it's going to create this

50
00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:07.950
dashboard e to e, It's gonna generate
this dashboard application here.

51
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.590
All right, this looks good.

52
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.150
Updating angular.json.

53
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.850
So it's just a really handy way to see,
did I get my

54
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.840
naming conventions correct and
is it going into the right spot?

55
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.680
So that's kind of a major bummer when
you're like I think I got my file

56
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.500
structure right, you maybe missed some
folder and now you have this thing that's

57
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.970
been generated that you have to kinda
delete or move around, not fun.

58
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.710
So I definitely recommend,
is this really what I want to do?

59
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.640
Just add a- D to the end of it and
you can do a dry run.

60
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.660
But this is indeed what I do want to do.

61
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.413
So we will go ahead and run this.

62
00:04:47.413 --> 00:04:52.520
All right, so now,
if we go back into our file system,

63
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.970
you notice here, in apps,
that we now have a dashboard application,

64
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.920
as well as an end to end
application right next to it.

65
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.000
And then from here it's generated

66
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.620
all of our files do have
a standalone application.

67
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.030
So if you just went right from
the English sail line you did ng new app,

68
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.785
this is essentially what it would create.

69
00:05:18.785 --> 00:05:24.181
The difference is, because you're
going through narwhal extensions that

70
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:29.676
it has a very specific place that it's
putting it which is in the apps folder.

71
00:05:29.676 --> 00:05:34.793
And if you go down here,
let me just pull this down,

72
00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:39.690
that it's also keeping
track of your projects.

73
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.646
So you can kind of scroll down here and

74
00:05:43.646 --> 00:05:47.835
I'm not gonna read through the whole thing
but there are some configuration for

75
00:05:47.835 --> 00:05:52.042
everyone of the projects that you have as
well as your libs as you generate them.

76
00:05:54.728 --> 00:05:57.628
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We go down here
as well it's able to keep track of.

77
00:05:57.628 --> 00:06:03.430
In your nx.json,
these are the projects that you have.

78
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.570
And so, you can start to tag them and
compare them and

79
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.280
do some pretty interesting things there.

80
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.440
Now, if we want to run the application,
let

81
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.570
me just look real quick,
if we go into angular.json,

82
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.820
I'm pretty sure it's at the top or
it might be at the bottom.

83
00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.020
Yes, so right now,

84
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.320
if you look at the bottom of angular.json,
the default project is dashboard.

85
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.240
And so
when I go back into the command line, and

86
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.670
I go npm start that this
is going to spin up.

87
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:47.068
And once it's built,
we'll go back to localhost 4200.

88
00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.550
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go latent,
so jumping from one branch to another.

89
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.100
And here we go, so
this is a super basic default.

90
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.230
This is your Nrwl workspace.

91
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.730
Here we are.
