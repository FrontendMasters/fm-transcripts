00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.521
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If we go
into app.component.html,

2
00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:11.113
notice here on the sidenav-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We

3
00:00:11.113 --> 00:00:14.870
have a sidenav local template reference.

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.350
And then what we can do
is if we go up here,

5
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.480
we have this button so if we look at
the app, it's this button right here.

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.860
This is what when we click
this we want to toggle this.

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.580
And so capture the click.

8
00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:49.135
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then from here sidenav,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Toggle.

9
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.761
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let me just do that one
more time cuz I think its tooling is

10
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:59.779
starting to increase in its capabilities
and its ability to introspect code.

11
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.430
I start typing and
IntelliSense is able to pick it up and

12
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.740
say, here is these additional methods.

13
00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.600
And so this is sidenav.toggle.

14
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.540
If we go here, let's save this.

15
00:01:18.698 --> 00:01:21.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And so, we just took two
things and we just put them together.

16
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.850
So we had a click that when
we clicked in this case

17
00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.980
because this is an Angular
material component

18
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.930
that is exposing this toggle
method as you saw in IntelliSense.

19
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.992
That we're saying, when we click
this we want to call sidenav.toggle.

20
00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:46.199
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So that toggle method
is built into the material component,

21
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:47.939
is what you're saying?

22
00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:48.539
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yep.

23
00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:49.914
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'll show you one other

24
00:01:49.914 --> 00:01:51.240
thing that I think is really handy.

25
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.820
That when I'm working with code,
I'm like, what does this thing do?

26
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.610
A lot of times,
I'll just Command + click on that.

27
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.800
And it would take TypeScript definition,
and you can start to kind of poke around.

28
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.560
And so MatSidenav extends MatDrawer,
and I feel like if I kept going

29
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.730
down this rabbit hole, eventually,
I'd find like a toggle method in here.

30
00:02:20.803 --> 00:02:22.705
There we go.

31
00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:26.389
And so just to summarize that point
is that if you're in something and

32
00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.132
like what does this do, or
what is available to me?

33
00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:31.860
TypeScript definitions you can click in,
you can step and you can see.

34
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.280
So it's really, really handy obviously
I'm dealing with any kind of

35
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.880
part of Angular or Ngrx or even
components, you can step in, you can start

36
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.850
to kind of introspect yourself and start
to make sense of what this thing does.

37
00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's talk
of just a few more things.

38
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.137
So we have a title here
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

39
00:02:58.137 --> 00:03:00.620
this is an app.component.html.

40
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.510
So if I go into just
the regular app.component.ts.

41
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.300
Notice here that we have the title.

42
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.590
It's dashboard.

43
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.902
I'm gonna change this to
Angular Core Workshop.

44
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.775
There we go.

45
00:03:15.775 --> 00:03:21.830
So you can imagine if we go back here.

46
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.350
Now, Angular Core Workshop.

47
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.140
So far so good.
