00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
now we've seen the event come through.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.330
Let's assign this to,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: A local property.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.741
Now,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That we've assigned this,

4
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:17.430
how do we know which one we've selected?

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.110
Well, we could just dump
it into the template.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.536
So we'll go back here, and let's do this.

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.372
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Handy pretag,
we'll go selectedProject,

8
00:00:36.372 --> 00:00:39.719
and we'll set this to json.

9
00:00:44.397 --> 00:00:44.923
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Look at this.

10
00:00:49.218 --> 00:00:52.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So as we select we're going
through, so this is just to kind of set

11
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.969
the stage, not super useful, but
eventually we'll drop a form in here, and

12
00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.870
then actually use this information
to populate form so you can update.

13
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.690
Let's go a little bit further,
and let's do something fun here.

14
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.070
So we know the project, it's selected,
let's go, selectedProject.

15
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.980
Not selectProject, let's go
selectedProject, and let's go, title.

16
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.720
Let's save this.

17
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.430
Let's see what happens.

18
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.048
I would imagine if I go down here,
there's an error.

19
00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:33.590
Like, can I read property of undefined?

20
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.379
And so
you will run into occasions where you

21
00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:39.724
bind into something that
just doesn't exist yet.

22
00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:40.870
And what do you do?

23
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.370
Pray tell.

24
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.771
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You can do a couple things.

25
00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:51.540
So, you can add in the safe
navigation operator.

26
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.785
So, what it would do,
it will say does, it exist?

27
00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:59.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that typescript or

28
00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.051
is that angular-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That's angular.

29
00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:03.572
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's angular, okay.

30
00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:04.179
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.
