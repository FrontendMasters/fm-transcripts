1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's do
the details component.

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.590
So if we go into our
project details component,

3
00:00:23.742 --> 00:00:25.975
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So it's looking for

4
00:00:25.975 --> 00:00:30.973
selectedProject, as well as saveProject.

5
00:00:30.973 --> 00:00:36.450
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
just take this event handler off For

6
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.382
now, we can put it back.

7
00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:42.548
Select a project, and

8
00:00:42.548 --> 00:00:48.035
let's take this off as well.

9
00:00:48.035 --> 00:00:53.955
All right so, obviously we
need a select a project input.

10
00:00:53.955 --> 00:01:03.356
So, if we go into the component,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How do we do that?

11
00:01:03.356 --> 00:01:11.612
Well, input, so input,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It'll go,

12
00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:18.751
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's just do this.

13
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:21.223
We'll call it project.

14
00:01:21.223 --> 00:01:21.989
Makes sense.

15
00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:25.404
So I think really select
a project is like a concern of

16
00:01:25.404 --> 00:01:27.665
actually that parent component.

17
00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:31.292
Like this is the selected project,
internally it's just says hey,

18
00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:32.300
this is a project.

19
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.428
And let's also, since we're here,
let's do output

20
00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:44.445
of,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: saved.

21
00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:46.586
Now, remember when you create an output,

22
00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:48.971
you need to instantiate
it as an EventEmitter.

23
00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:55.098
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Make sure
that I got output imported.

24
00:01:55.098 --> 00:01:56.270
Good, good, good.

25
00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.774
And we'll call this cancelled.

26
00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:02.333
Seems pretty reasonable.

27
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:09.449
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: This is not happy
that we're not implementing OnInit,

28
00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.055
we don't really need it, so
we'll just take that off,

29
00:02:22.294 --> 00:02:23.367
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And this takes

30
00:02:23.367 --> 00:02:28.736
selectedProject because that doesn't
exist on our component class,

31
00:02:28.736 --> 00:02:30.981
and let's just change that.

32
00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.578
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So already,
we say what's going on?

33
00:02:44.578 --> 00:02:47.360
Can't read property "id" of undefined.

34
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.239
Well, we saw that coming.

35
00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.926
Let's go in to our project component, and

36
00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:02.952
let's bind to project equals.

37
00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:04.418
Was it selected project?

38
00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:08.334
There we go.

39
00:03:08.334 --> 00:03:16.520
Save this,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Must

40
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.074
have that console log still in there.

41
00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.307
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No.

42
00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:25.459
It's still happening.

43
00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.524
[LAUGH] I knew that was gonna happen.

44
00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:32.486
Playing with you guys.

45
00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:37.109
So let's just hook up our
EventMeters real quick.

46
00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:45.830
So saveProject($event),

47
00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:50.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And we'll duplicate this,

48
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.744
and we'll go canceled.

49
00:03:58.927 --> 00:04:01.417
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: This is just cancel,
all right?

50
00:04:01.417 --> 00:04:06.847
So this is pretty much
what I would expect.

51
00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:11.455
Kinda am in a pretty stable spot,
let me just back this up.

52
00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:15.194
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And those names.

53
00:04:15.194 --> 00:04:17.915
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Are you showing
the console your error?

54
00:04:17.915 --> 00:04:18.636
Our error?

55
00:04:18.636 --> 00:04:20.186
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What's that?

56
00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:21.268
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The console.

57
00:04:21.268 --> 00:04:22.134
This error.

58
00:04:22.134 --> 00:04:26.267
[INAUDIBLE] That error?

59
00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:27.238
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The one?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

60
00:04:27.238 --> 00:04:28.514
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay.

61
00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:29.429
What's that?

62
00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:31.505
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, that's right.

63
00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:32.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is this right?

64
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.220
Let me see.

65
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.446
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Cancelled so

66
00:04:34.446 --> 00:04:36.205
this is the event.

67
00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:37.456
And so I'm listening for this event.

68
00:04:37.456 --> 00:04:41.276
So if I called this wahoo,

69
00:04:41.276 --> 00:04:46.146
then here I'd have to change it.

70
00:04:46.146 --> 00:04:49.099
So I'm defining like this is the event
that I wanna listen for, and

71
00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.022
then here in the Cancel event
we're just resetting the project.

72
00:04:52.022 --> 00:04:57.330
So we're starting to see kind of
like data in, events come out.
