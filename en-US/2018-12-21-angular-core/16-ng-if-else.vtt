00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.761
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So what we could
do is, and this is where we'll

2
00:00:05.761 --> 00:00:11.174
introduce another structural directive,

3
00:00:11.174 --> 00:00:16.000
is that in our project title here,what

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.949
we can do is let's introduce and

5
00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.849
ngIf
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

6
00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.372
I do span,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: ngIF,

7
00:00:31.372 --> 00:00:39.593
and let's just say,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If there is,

8
00:00:39.593 --> 00:00:41.320
and actually I apologize.

9
00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.489
Let me go down here,
I'm in the wrong block here.

10
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.740
Here we are, let's do this.

11
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.665
So we'll go, we're at this in a span.

12
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:02.631
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And then we're
going to attach ngIf to this, so span.

13
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:16.914
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: ngIf, and we're just
gonna say if there is a selectedProject,

14
00:01:16.914 --> 00:01:19.351
let's go ahead and do this.

15
00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:26.040
And so if selectedProject exists,
then this is going to show.

16
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.760
So you can actually take
the safe navigation operator off.

17
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.500
So one thing or common technique,
generally, if I look at a template and

18
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.310
there's just a turn of safe navigation
operators, like does this exist and

19
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.180
does this exist?

20
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.760
I think that is kind of a sign that
maybe you should do a higher level

21
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.890
like does this thing even exist,
if so then I'll show it.

22
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.817
So this is a way to kind of
keep from [INAUDIBLE] with some

23
00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:54.890
super verbose kind of DOM.

24
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.144
I'll duplicate this line
because we can say, well,

25
00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:07.868
if it doesn't exist then let's just go
select project, or select a project.

26
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.360
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, save this.

27
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.550
We'll go here, select a project.

28
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.570
Selected.

29
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.990
So if we go down here,
what we really wanna do

30
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.760
is if it doesn't exist,
we wanna show something else.

31
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.721
So we wrap it in an ng-template and

32
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:41.590
then notice that we have this thing,
it's an else block.

33
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.840
But more importantly,
what is this right here?

34
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.760
So what this allows you to do is
it's a local template variable,

35
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.040
is that you can by using the pound sign,
you can create a variable

36
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.170
that references the element
that this is on.

37
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:09.639
So here we can go,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: else.

38
00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:10.648
Was it elseif?

39
00:03:12.602 --> 00:03:13.635
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's else.

40
00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.522
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Here elseBlock.

41
00:03:27.235 --> 00:03:28.348
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

42
00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:33.020
So this is, I believe, a lot cleaner
than just stacking a bunch of like NgIfs

43
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.660
turning it on and
say if it's this or this.

44
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.418
And so let me just summarize
what's happened here.

45
00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:45.704
So, we took ngIf and we are saying
instead of adding another ngIf for

46
00:03:45.704 --> 00:03:50.114
the else clause,
that we are going to go else and

47
00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:56.211
then we're gonna say instead show
this block here, else block.

48
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:58.052
You would call this whatever you want.

49
00:03:58.052 --> 00:04:03.231
And then within a ng-template we
are putting the code that we wanna see.

50
00:04:05.454 --> 00:04:08.102
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
then from here, elseBlock, and so

51
00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:12.820
this is how we're saying,
if it's this, show what's in here.

52
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.169
If not, take this content right here,
and project it into here.

53
00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.951
And you're referencing it,

54
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:23.525
you're connecting it via this
local template reference.
