00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.690
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's
start with the list,

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.891
because it's going to be the easiest,

3
00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.230
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: In our
ProjectsListComponent.

4
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:20.515
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What do
we need to render the list?

5
00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:25.014
Projects, right?

6
00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:28.060
So we do this via this input decorator.

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.970
Make sure that's imported.

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.980
Now, little caveat here is
decorators are functions.

9
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.310
And so make sure that you
close this with parentheses.

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.260
And we're just going to go projects.

11
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.290
We can even strongly type this if we want.

12
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.149
Remember we did this at workspace thing,
this is the alternate to that,

13
00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.670
pretty ugly, right?

14
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.090
So let's go back here.

15
00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.248
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Much better.

16
00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:07.903
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay.

17
00:01:13.188 --> 00:01:16.599
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so
now that we have an Input of projects, so

18
00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.798
what we're saying is,
this is a property on this class,

19
00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:23.685
that we are allowing external forces or

20
00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:28.240
mechanisms to basically satisfy
this particular property.

21
00:01:31.454 --> 00:01:36.815
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so
if we go to projectListComponent in here,

22
00:01:36.815 --> 00:01:38.527
what we can do.

23
00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:44.433
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: How do we
dump something onto the stage?

24
00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:50.173
Pre projects json}},

25
00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:52.908
here we go.

26
00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:02.490
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it's there, we are
binding to it, but there's no projects.

27
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.023
How do we get that in there?

28
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.943
&gt;&gt; Student: Is that it?
May sync, right.

29
00:02:08.943 --> 00:02:12.654
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So you have two main
type of binding, property binding and

30
00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:13.723
event binding.

31
00:02:13.723 --> 00:02:16.631
And so this is where kind of everything
we've talked about is going to,

32
00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:17.850
I feel like, come together.

33
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.894
So remember when I said,
I wanna do style.color?

34
00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:26.870
And whenever that color change, so I could
have actually hooked this into a text box

35
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.470
that whenever I change it, it would
automatically update and change the color.

36
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.147
Well now, check this out.

37
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:43.370
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's now saying,
this component has an input of projects.

38
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.976
Then I can go here.

39
00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:51.780
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
we can go projects.

40
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.197
Now notice, this is an observable.

41
00:02:55.378 --> 00:02:57.582
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
I can unwrap it with the async pipe.

42
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.877
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go back.

43
00:03:05.307 --> 00:03:09.520
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
notice now that we're passing that in.

44
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.392
But the beauty of it is that
this ProjectsListComponent

45
00:03:17.392 --> 00:03:22.430
in here, it has no conception of
where that data is coming from.

46
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.560
It's ambivalent and

47
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.590
impervious to the implementation
details of where that's coming from.

48
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.070
It just knows,
I'll take whatever you give me.

49
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.470
And so you can pick this up and
move it in all sorts of places.

50
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.230
And as long as you match up to this
interface, it's totally fine, and

51
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.653
it's totally portable.

52
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.240
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
projects, pretty good.

53
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.770
Let's also do.

54
00:03:49.916 --> 00:03:52.307
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm
gonna add one more input.

55
00:03:54.651 --> 00:03:57.180
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
we're just going to call this readonly.

56
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.640
For instance,
let's say you wanna show the list but

57
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.339
you don't wanna allow them to actually
delete it, you just wanna show the list.

58
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.830
Readonly, and
we're going to set this to false.

59
00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.538
So by default this is not readonly, but

60
00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:17.401
you could set to true and we'll see why.

61
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:24.686
So in our template let's go a head and
get rid of these comments here.

62
00:04:37.013 --> 00:04:40.215
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take these click events off

63
00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:41.210
for just a moment.

64
00:04:46.102 --> 00:04:47.909
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And we'll go here.

65
00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:54.100
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We can
probably get rid of this.

66
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.177
But what we do wanna do is.

67
00:05:04.396 --> 00:05:04.920
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Here.

68
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.120
Instead of allowing it to delete, well,
we'll put all this up in a second, but

69
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.440
more so is we'll go ngif readonly.

70
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.990
And so now, if we refresh this.

71
00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:29.140
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's not here.

72
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.500
Did I set this to true?

73
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.400
Let me just double check.

74
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.974
Or rather, not readonly, yeah.

75
00:05:37.974 --> 00:05:39.310
Wait for it.

76
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.130
And so now we're showing it.

77
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.180
But if you wanted to pick this up and

78
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.150
first let's put it on to the home
component, then that may not be a place

79
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.880
where you want to allow them
to manipulate that collection.
