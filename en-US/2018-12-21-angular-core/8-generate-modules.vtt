WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's do the feature that
we're going to be kind of focusing on,

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.370
at least for
the first part of this workshop, ng g m.

3
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.876
We're gonna call this projects,
also with routing.

4
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Go ahead and run that.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.720
And then we'll also do
the projects component.

6
00:00:21.552 --> 00:00:25.081
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
let's go ahead and do one more.

7
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:28.059
And so this one's a bit of a toss-up,

8
00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:32.447
we'll see how far we get,
but customers, same thing.

9
00:00:32.447 --> 00:00:34.390
It's nice to at least have these for
a placeholder.

10
00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:40.501
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: ng g c customers.

11
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.165
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There we go.

12
00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:50.868
And so if we look over here,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That in our app,

13
00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:56.045
we now have customers, home, and projects.

14
00:00:56.045 --> 00:01:00.840
So very quickly we're starting to just
spin this up, and things are happening.

15
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.918
And if you look in the app module,
you'll notice that,

16
00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:10.128
well this isn't, so what I need to do is.

17
00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:15.343
Right now we have the material module,
but what we need to do is,

18
00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:20.271
because we generate these
features as stand alone modules,

19
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:23.670
how do we get these into our application?

20
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.461
So if we go into our code, and so
let's just do home real quick.

21
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:35.468
We have our home module, and so

22
00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:41.032
this is going to hold everything
that has to do with home.

23
00:01:41.032 --> 00:01:45.692
So if we go into Our AppModule
will just go down here and

24
00:01:45.692 --> 00:01:48.510
we'll just import this in.

25
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.120
So HomeModule, there we go.

26
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.480
And you'll notice that it's imported.

27
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.775
So we now have the AppComponent and
our HomeModule.

28
00:02:00.775 --> 00:02:04.569
And we can do this as well for
our ProjectsModule, so

29
00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.732
we'll just add these all in.

30
00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:17.293
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And our CustomersModule.

31
00:02:21.685 --> 00:02:22.565
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And if we go in

32
00:02:22.565 --> 00:02:27.540
our HomeModule,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We'll see that our

33
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.660
HomeComponent.

34
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.780
So let's what happens if we go into,

35
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:42.259
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'll just take this.

36
00:02:47.398 --> 00:02:51.709
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: We'll

37
00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.740
go app.

38
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.226
For our home component, let's just make
sure my selector's correct at home.

39
00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:04.240
There we go.

40
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.583
Let me just double check and
make sure this compiled.

41
00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:10.832
So far so good.

42
00:03:10.832 --> 00:03:17.152
And let's refresh this and see,
I might have thrown in an error.

43
00:03:17.152 --> 00:03:22.833
App home is not in your element,
so let's try this,

44
00:03:22.833 --> 00:03:27.363
so Exports,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: HomeComponent, so

45
00:03:27.363 --> 00:03:31.230
I think we're back to kind of
our material kind of trick here.

46
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.485
So let's just take this out.
