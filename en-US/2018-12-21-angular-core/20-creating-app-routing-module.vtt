00:00:03.079 --> 00:00:06.431
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's
talk about routing.

2
00:00:06.431 --> 00:00:11.872
Up to this point we've kind of
just went to a single component,

3
00:00:11.872 --> 00:00:15.476
and this is where our attention has been.

4
00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:20.451
But, naturally, we like to build things
that are as complex as the world that we

5
00:00:20.451 --> 00:00:25.353
live in, which means that multiple
features, in fact, I think we were having

6
00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:29.958
a conversation we're you're looking
at pulling in like 30 features or

7
00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:34.890
something crazy, well,
programming is hard because life is hard.

8
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.001
So, let's talk about routing and

9
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:44.116
a way to navigate from feature to feature.

10
00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:50.562
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,
if we look in the root of our

11
00:00:50.562 --> 00:00:55.417
project,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm going to pull up

12
00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:58.540
app dot module, which is already up.

13
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.770
And, if we look down here,
when I generated this,

14
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.600
I said I would very much
like to have routing.

15
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.386
Well, in line within
the module definition,

16
00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:15.100
this is feasible,

17
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.650
I could even extract this out and
just say routes.

18
00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.001
And then above here,
do something like, and

19
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:30.680
then put a routing table in here,
and drop the send.

20
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.980
But, what I'm going to do, and I think
it's interesting, that when you generate

21
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.210
a module with routing that you
get a standalone routing file.

22
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.478
So I'll just put this back for
just a moment.

23
00:01:49.614 --> 00:01:51.620
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
make sure my app is running.

24
00:01:56.632 --> 00:02:02.508
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hopefully nothing went
awry and if we look in, for instance,

25
00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:08.158
the project's component,
that we have a projects routing

26
00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:13.356
module here where they've
taken the routing table and

27
00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:18.690
they've extracted it out
into a stand-alone module.

28
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.220
So let's go ahead and do a similar
thing for our top-level application.

29
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.600
Because I think actually
having that nested inlined

30
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.980
in your top level module
is not really a good idea.

31
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.390
Let's just see where we are.

32
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.763
Well, I'll do it this way.

33
00:02:37.763 --> 00:02:41.816
We'll go here, New File,

34
00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:46.409
app.routing.module.ts.

35
00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:52.400
And so, similar to our feature running
modules, I've just manually created this,

36
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.740
and then within here I'm just going to
paste in the general structure here.

37
00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.719
But because we're not a child, where this
is top-level we're gonna go for root,

38
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.470
and then I'm going to change
this to AppRoutingModule.

39
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.832
So the only thing I've done is I've
just picked up the routing file

40
00:03:18.832 --> 00:03:24.005
from our feature components and
I've just created an app hyphen

41
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:29.107
routing module file, and
I changed from forChild to forRoot.

42
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.068
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now what we will
do is go into the module itself,

43
00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:47.710
@Module and
let's get rid of this right here.

44
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.550
And lets add this in as a standalone.

45
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.524
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Module.

46
00:03:57.524 --> 00:04:01.520
AppRouting module, let me just make
sure where this is coming from.

47
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.210
Occasionally VS code has
some funny ideas about

48
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.860
where the stuff that I
wanna pull in exists.

49
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.670
So AppRoutingModule, now it exists.

50
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.335
Now let's add in some tables.
