00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.200
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So one thing I will do
very quickly is, we'll go back to my app,

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.670
component dot html and
I'm going to just pull this out.

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:21.300
And in its place,
let's put in the projects.

4
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.520
So we'll go to the ProjectsModule.

5
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.756
I'm just going to,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Export

6
00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:35.390
the ProjectsComponent so
that it's available here.

7
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.120
So this is in the ProjectsStyleModule.

8
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.490
We're exporting the Projects.Component.

9
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.780
And then I'll hop back
into app.component.html.

10
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.881
And we will add in app.project, and

11
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:57.703
I can see that because we
have exported this properly

12
00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:02.882
that the code was able to pick that up.

13
00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:07.005
So Intellisense is amazing
when it's working,

14
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:10.933
it is incredibly
frustrating when it's not.

15
00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:15.500
All right so
now we just add it in our projects

16
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.955
component into our app component.html.

17
00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:24.217
So if we go back Into our application,

18
00:01:24.217 --> 00:01:30.490
we can see here local host,
4200, project works!

19
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.020
And so this is very, very small, but this
is typically default when you generate

20
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.980
the component that it just says whatever
the component's name is, it works.

21
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.800
Now, let's hop into our snippets,
and let's build this out.

22
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.690
And so I'm going into the snippets file.

23
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.970
So if you go to the projects component,

24
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.890
down here we're just
going to copy this and

25
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.630
we're going to paste this in to our code.

26
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.214
So this is all HTML, so

27
00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:19.100
in our projects.component.html
we're going to paste this in.

28
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.726
Now you'll notice here that in our
math card content these different

29
00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:30.267
angular material things that it's
angry like what's happening.

30
00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:35.273
Because the projects component
is behind a module we need

31
00:02:35.273 --> 00:02:41.813
to go to the projects module,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Here and

32
00:02:41.813 --> 00:02:48.661
we need to import the material module.

33
00:02:52.324 --> 00:02:53.604
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

34
00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:03.010
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Like so.

35
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.586
Now if we go back into our component
that the language services

36
00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:11.110
hasn't caught up but
this should be good to go.

37
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:18.120
As you can see here that now
we have some basic layout and

38
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.440
we could start to work with this.

39
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.250
So this is strictly just basic HTML.

40
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.420
While we're here, since we're
building this out, let's go up and

41
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.770
let's also do the App Component.

42
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.977
So we'll just copy App Component and

43
00:03:37.977 --> 00:03:43.675
if we go to app component.html,
I am going to just paste this in.

44
00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:50.304
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Here, and
I'll walk through the structure

45
00:03:50.304 --> 00:03:54.987
here in just a moment,
of what we are doing.

46
00:03:59.578 --> 00:04:03.118
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right, so
just make sure that this renders, and

47
00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:06.344
I will catch everybody up
on what we are saying.

48
00:04:08.938 --> 00:04:13.440
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So this is our
component, or projects component.

49
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.220
The difference is that we have
went into our app component,

50
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.630
and using angular material we started
to structure some components.

51
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.910
And so we have our tool bar right here.

52
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.570
With our icon, we have our logo,
some different things.

53
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.030
So these are strictly just structural,
here's how we're going to organize.

54
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.960
As you can imagine,
we created the UI tool bar,

55
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.410
anybody want to take a guess where
this is going to be going eventually?

56
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.510
Into that lib.

57
00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.100
Then we have a sidenav-container.

58
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.750
What this does is it allows us
to basically put a navigation

59
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.090
into the sidenav, and then just outside
of that we have our main content.

60
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.210
So if anybody would like me to
offer more commentary on some on

61
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.720
angular material components.

62
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.595
But I typically find their
fairly self descriptive and

63
00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:13.858
that's nearly interesting is what's
happening under the hood in the angular.

64
00:05:13.858 --> 00:05:18.894
And so
if we go back to our projects component,

65
00:05:18.894 --> 00:05:24.993
what we see here is I just have
two columns and two cards.

66
00:05:24.993 --> 00:05:28.400
Okay, so this is a very basic component.

67
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.390
There's not other than
the angular components themselves

68
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.640
that very well documented.

69
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.360
We're not doing anything yet.

70
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.170
Yes sir?

71
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have ES code
extension that's doing that?

72
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:48.490
Sort of smart looking into your angular
modules and determining what's going on.

73
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.350
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So there's angular
language services under the hood.

74
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.140
That's kind of surfacing some of
the angular pieces as well as,

75
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.080
because this is type script,
that it's able to infer certain things

76
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.490
that well, this is now being
exported from this thing.

77
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.910
It is now available.

78
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.590
And most modern browsers or
modern IDEs will do that.

79
00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.300
So WebStorm and VSCode,
I kind of flip flop between the two, and

80
00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.630
they're pretty good about
introspecting and seeing the code.
