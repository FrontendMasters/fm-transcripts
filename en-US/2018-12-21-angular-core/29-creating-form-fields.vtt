WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now, the beauty of this
is that when we cancel this, and

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:12.030
we want to go and fill this out.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.770
Well, the thing is, this doesn't have
an ID yet, because it's an empty object.

4
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.410
And so now you can say,
does this have an ID, yes or no?

5
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.040
If it has an ID, update it,
if not, create it.

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.201
So essentially it's a kind of an upsert
as it checks does this exist, if not,

7
00:00:26.201 --> 00:00:28.390
create it, if it does, then update it.

8
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.944
We'll notice here as
well in the component,

9
00:00:32.944 --> 00:00:37.810
we'll go up here, that we're
checking does the product exist?

10
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.476
Well, it's always going to exist,

11
00:00:40.476 --> 00:00:44.700
because now we're initializing
it to this empty object.

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.465
So we go here.

13
00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:50.215
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Select the project.

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.008
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Then we hit Cancel,
then it goes back to nothing.

15
00:00:56.008 --> 00:00:59.066
So into our code now.

16
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:04.181
Let's go ahead and let's build out for

17
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:09.320
the rest of the properties here.

18
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.846
So Title, we had, let's check here.

19
00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:25.614
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Details,
percentComplete, and approved.

20
00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:31.357
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
we'll make this actually a texttarea.

21
00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:41.756
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Details and
because this is a textarea.

22
00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:47.843
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Then you need to close that.

23
00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:51.932
And then what we'll do here is,

24
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.443
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: For the percent complete,

25
00:02:05.088 --> 00:02:06.112
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Let's do linear,

26
00:02:06.112 --> 00:02:08.930
just kind of a new component,
cuz it's fun.

27
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.880
So we'll go h4.

28
00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:19.603
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: SelectedProject.

29
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.989
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: PercentComplete.

30
00:02:28.214 --> 00:02:30.209
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I don't know
why that came out as a class.

31
00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:44.619
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Complete, and
then from here let's introduce a slider.

32
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.299
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I'll go mat.

33
00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.978
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then within the slider,
we're gonna go into the class,

34
00:03:01.978 --> 00:03:03.453
also set this to full-width.

35
00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
then let's set some additional properties.

36
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.409
So min is going to be 0.

37
00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.120
Max is going to be 100.

38
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.670
And let's add in the thumbLabel.

39
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.029
So some of these things,

40
00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.737
it's just a matter of actually
looking it up in the documentation.

41
00:03:27.116 --> 00:03:27.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: ThumbLabel.

42
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.247
And then we're going to also hook in.

43
00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:45.818
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Es code is being just
crazy right now, no tick interval.

44
00:03:52.851 --> 00:03:55.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: NgModel.

45
00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.160
So this is two-way data binding that,
if parentheses are events, and

46
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.510
brackets are properties, that essentially
you're connecting the two together.

47
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.383
So making a two-way street.

48
00:04:13.423 --> 00:04:18.655
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: SelectedProject and
percentComplete.

49
00:04:21.218 --> 00:04:23.065
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And we have one more here.

50
00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:33.588
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
the one thing I had to do as well.

51
00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:42.324
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is mat-form-field
is very particular about what can

52
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:43.876
actually go in it.

53
00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:49.270
And so mat-form-field, I took that off and
I made this just a section.

54
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.818
And let's do one more, also a section.

55
00:04:54.818 --> 00:05:02.818
And mat-checkbox ngModel

56
00:05:02.818 --> 00:05:11.515
selectedProject.approved

57
00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:16.039
name approve.

58
00:05:18.375 --> 00:05:19.244
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right.

59
00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:27.239
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Approved By Customer.

60
00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:31.888
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
an extra angle on line 52.

61
00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:33.872
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Line 52.

62
00:05:33.872 --> 00:05:37.263
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mat-slider
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Good eye.

63
00:05:39.652 --> 00:05:44.649
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And then I believe,
this on the other hand,

64
00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:49.253
needs to have a closing mat-checkbox.

65
00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:54.787
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right.

66
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.025
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So Title, Details,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And I wonder,

67
00:06:04.025 --> 00:06:05.325
let me just double-check.

68
00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:13.063
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There we go.

69
00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:13.779
So here.

70
00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:23.624
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And for some reason,

71
00:06:23.624 --> 00:06:29.249
the slider is not binding correctly.

72
00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:36.596
Right, name=percentComplete.

73
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:41.698
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There we go.
