00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.711
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So now let's get
down to what we're actually going to be

2
00:00:04.711 --> 00:00:07.318
building over the workshop and

3
00:00:07.318 --> 00:00:12.144
what you can expect over the next seven or
eight modules.

4
00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:19.729
So we have a project, and it is for
the most part a master detail view.

5
00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:24.862
And so we are going to be building out
this project's feature within the project.

6
00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:28.972
And you have a master list of projects,
and then you select one.

7
00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:32.824
Then you can see the different detail or
the details for

8
00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:37.610
the specific project that you can update,
delete and manipulate.

9
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.330
So I believe that the master detail
view interface is one of the most

10
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.230
fundamental interfaces for
line of business applications.

11
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.720
It's very, very common, I mean,

12
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.700
pretty much every line of
business application that I see

13
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.080
is you have a master list of something and
then you're going to manipulate that.

14
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.370
So when you wanna build a new framework,
for instance, or

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.160
test out the new framework,
what do you do?

16
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.295
Well, you build out a to-do app.

17
00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:02.472
Well, what is a to-do app?

18
00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:05.257
It's a master detail view,
depending on how you implement it.

19
00:01:05.257 --> 00:01:10.378
But a master list of to-do
items that you then manipulate.

20
00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:15.739
And so we are going to be focusing
on building out this application,

21
00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:20.453
and then dropping in or
building out the projects feature.

22
00:01:20.453 --> 00:01:24.470
And what you see here
on the screen is what,

23
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.728
by the end of the workshop,
this is where we will end up.

24
00:01:29.728 --> 00:01:35.001
So the project detail view has been
built out using component driven

25
00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:41.767
architecture communicating with the REST
server forms and component fundamentals.

26
00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:46.196
A lot of the directors to
the different bindings and

27
00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:51.144
things that you would expect
in an Angular application.

28
00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:52.984
But if we hop into the repo,

29
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:57.704
we have broken this up into a couple
different branches to be helpful.

30
00:01:57.704 --> 00:02:02.247
So I was in the 08 component
architecture branch, and so

31
00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:07.680
when you finish the workshop,
this is where you will end up.

32
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.403
But if you go to, for
instance, the master branch,

33
00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:16.477
this is a completely blank Angular or
space Angular CLI project

34
00:02:16.477 --> 00:02:22.163
with a few additional resources to kind
of streamline getting up and starting.

35
00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:27.068
So I've actually fleshed out the style
sheet, and a couple different images

36
00:02:27.068 --> 00:02:31.386
as well as a back-end implementation
that you'll just move over.

37
00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:38.759
And so right now we are on the kind of
the finish branch for the workshop.

38
00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:44.649
Now if I jump into here,
I can checkout master.

39
00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:51.176
And this is, for all intents and
purposes, a completely empty workspace.

40
00:02:51.176 --> 00:02:55.532
So if I go npm start,
there's actually nothing to run.

41
00:02:55.532 --> 00:02:59.503
We are going to build this
up from ground zero and

42
00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:02.592
then start to stack these concepts.

43
00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:05.313
But the main application we will be
building will go into the apps directory.

44
00:03:05.313 --> 00:03:09.941
And then we will build
some common libraries

45
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:14.454
that go into the libs directory down here.

46
00:03:14.454 --> 00:03:18.247
Now because there is quite
a bit of material to cover,

47
00:03:18.247 --> 00:03:22.630
as well as some additional things
that we're just not going to

48
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.810
have time to get to in this workshop.

49
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.950
What I have done is I've created
an additional reference branch.

50
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.310
And so this has everything
that we're going to cover

51
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.680
in the workshop plus some
additional techniques and

52
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.100
things that you can use as you're
building out your own applications.

53
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.500
And so I'll go ahead and run this.

54
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.784
So, npm start.

55
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.358
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And then in here,
if we refresh this, since it's building,

56
00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:00.214
here we go.

57
00:04:00.214 --> 00:04:04.785
You can see that here's
our project's feature but

58
00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:09.778
we can go into customers and
we have a list of customers,

59
00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:13.726
this kind of cool status report component.

60
00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:16.856
You can actually select on a customer and
then drill down.

61
00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:20.276
So, this is like a master detailed view
but I've separated it across two routes.

62
00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.970
And then, for instance,
we have child routes.

63
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.270
We have a kind of a home component,

64
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.970
where you'd put any widgets
rather that you want.

65
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.071
So just showing kind of
the portability of components,

66
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:38.270
as well as we have a login
feature here that you can login.

67
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.381
And then checking a JavaScript web token,

68
00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:48.329
then we're doing an HTTP interceptor
as well as a route card.

69
00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:53.120
So there's definitely plenty of things in
here outside of the workshop that once you

70
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.156
finish the workshop I encourage
you to go to the repo,

71
00:04:56.156 --> 00:05:00.002
pull down this branch specifically and
start to look through some of

72
00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:03.665
the additional pieces that I'm
certain you will find helpful.
