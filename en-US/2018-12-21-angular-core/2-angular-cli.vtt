00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.960
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right, so
the first thing that you need to do if you

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.590
are going to work with NSWorkspaces
is that you need to install the CLI.

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.250
Now, the Angular CLI is, I believe,

4
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.750
a monumental leap forward for
Angular developers.

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.310
I believe that there's a React CLI,
there's a Vue CLI.

6
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.006
And what this allows you to do is
to generate opinionated code and

7
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:34.348
projects that adhere to the style guide.

8
00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:39.049
And so, fortunately, well,
when Angular JS started

9
00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:43.963
there was no real opinion on
how to build an application.

10
00:00:43.963 --> 00:00:46.986
It was like put your controllers
in a controllers folder,

11
00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:49.510
put your services in a services folder.

12
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.300
And we realized very quickly
that simply does not scale.

13
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.148
And so out of that,

14
00:00:55.148 --> 00:01:00.480
emerged some best practices which
then was quantified in a style guide.

15
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.730
Which then ended up in
the Angular CLI as we know it.

16
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.910
And I believe one of the biggest
advantages of using the CLI

17
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.910
is that it is predictable and
consistent across developers.

18
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.170
With the CLI that there's the ability
to extend that with schematics.

19
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.440
So I believe this really
officially came in Angular 6.

20
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.770
But now we can think of
the CLI as a platform for

21
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.790
building domain specific or specific
use generators that we can use to,

22
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.160
for instance, generate NgRx,
Ionic, whatever you may need.

23
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.104
Or even within your organization, you can
generate these specific schematics for

24
00:01:45.104 --> 00:01:48.222
whatever it is you need to
streamline development.

25
00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:53.656
And so,
in order to install the Angular CLI,

26
00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:58.241
it's just npm i -g @angular/cli.

27
00:01:58.241 --> 00:02:01.730
And I'm not going to do this,
because I already have it installed.

28
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.972
But then the next step is that
you would install the extensions,

29
00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:15.000
which if we hop into the readme,
which is about right here.

30
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.360
So NWRL schematics.

31
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.770
Yeah, so
anyways I had this working just perfectly.

32
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.810
I'm almost afraid to breathe on it,
all right.

33
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.020
So with that said,
let me generate an application and

34
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.950
let's just see what happens.

35
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.820
By the way a year, a year and a half ago,

36
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.020
this wouldn't have taken us probably
90 minutes to do, maybe more.

37
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.820
If it worked, it would take 90 minutes.

38
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.623
So, create-nx-workspace and

39
00:02:46.623 --> 00:02:53.660
we will call this, angular-core-workshop.

40
00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.780
So, let us run.

41
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.740
And so what this is going
to do is this is going to

42
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.570
create an Angular CLI
project that is designed

43
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.010
to hold additional Angular CLI or
Angular projects.

44
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.280
But, not only that is that
it splits the file structure

45
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.250
into applications, and reusable libraries.

46
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.750
And so after this generates,

47
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.780
and we kind of start to see this working,
I'll elaborate on why that's important.

48
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.956
But if we go into this folder,

49
00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.182
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And we just go code,

50
00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:47.866
and I'm gonna insert a new id here.

51
00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:56.487
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Zoom this out,
what we have here is an apps folder and

52
00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:57.840
a libs folder.

53
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.000
And we have some additional
files down here.

54
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.758
But for the most part, this is basically,
it has most of the pieces for

55
00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:14.041
an Angular CLI project and
your Angular CLI commands will work.

56
00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:23.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And if we go down to
package.json, you can see that ng for

57
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.488
the Angular CLI start, build, test,
so these are pretty stock but

58
00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:33.970
then down here we have
some additional commands,

59
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.520
such as, format right, format check, etc.

60
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.780
So, with that said,
I'm going to close this down

61
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.080
and this is exactly where I left off or
when you check everything in,

62
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.530
this is exactly what you get,
minus the resources folder.
