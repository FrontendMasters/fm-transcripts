00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.436
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right, so now,

2
00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:04.403
we're gonna just step
back just a little bit.

3
00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:10.219
And we're gonna fall back on our previous

4
00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.376
lesson of the template
stuff we were doing.

5
00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:19.670
And if you notice over here,

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.304
in the sidenav we have
this like link thing here.

7
00:00:25.304 --> 00:00:29.735
So we'll go

8
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:34.166
ngfor = let

9
00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:39.932
link in links.

10
00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.948
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then, link icon.

11
00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:56.710
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And link
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Title.

12
00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:13.672
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: ng4, [LAUGH].

13
00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:17.930
This is AngularJS, there we go, all right.

14
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.540
So we have these on the side.

15
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.777
Now, let's go ahead and put these up so

16
00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:28.487
that instead of having to go
through the browser window,

17
00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:33.997
that we can actually click on this and
navigate to these.

18
00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:39.770
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So on the link itself,
I'll just pull this down.

19
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.326
What we can do is on this, so
remember property binding.

20
00:01:46.326 --> 00:01:49.868
routerlink=link.path.

21
00:01:49.868 --> 00:01:55.342
And then what we can also

22
00:01:55.342 --> 00:02:01.373
do is routerlinkActive.

23
00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:07.510
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And it will detect if
this particular link is active, so for

24
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.898
instance, if you are on customers.

25
00:02:09.898 --> 00:02:14.112
And then,
what it can do is assign an active class.

26
00:02:14.112 --> 00:02:18.897
So for instance, you have a navigation,
you wanna keep track of where,

27
00:02:18.897 --> 00:02:20.970
then you can check that.

28
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.899
Also, let me double-check and see where is

29
00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:37.930
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I
think that was a work.

30
00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.240
Yes, all right.

31
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.210
And so, when you click on this, this
would be, unfortunately spelling errors.

32
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.179
And I don't wanna get in
the weeds too much on this, but

33
00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:51.300
at the same time,
I kinda need to fix this.

34
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.959
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because
they're being lazy loaded.

35
00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.875
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you don't have, okay.

36
00:03:03.897 --> 00:03:05.539
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You
write that person down and

37
00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:07.590
they are getting a t-shirt from me.

38
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.385
And 50 bucks.

39
00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:09.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

40
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.384
an all paid vacation.

41
00:03:13.112 --> 00:03:14.180
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So lazy loading.

42
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.703
It changes things.

43
00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:21.886
And if you're lazing loading a module,
so this is actually really interesting,

44
00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:25.840
is it illustrates how these
things come together.

45
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.972
Because if you're lazy loading a module,

46
00:03:29.972 --> 00:03:34.693
then would it make sense for
me to have to import?

47
00:03:34.693 --> 00:03:38.734
No.
The oversight on my part is that because

48
00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:43.740
this is coming in eventually,
no need to import it.

49
00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.796
And that where I was throwing this.

50
00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:46.859
I already know about this, but
now you're lazy loading it.

51
00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:47.895
Do I overwrite it, yes or no?

52
00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:52.927
So that is a very interesting

53
00:03:52.927 --> 00:03:56.916
lesson to be learned.
