WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:05.867
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,
making a round-trip for the server,

2
00:00:05.867 --> 00:00:10.200
we now are able to pull
the data in to Projects.

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.426
We can select it and we can see it.

4
00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:18.810
But how do we update it and
send it back to the server?

5
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.059
Or
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: The next question is

6
00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:27.348
if we actually want to create
a new project, how do we do that?

7
00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:31.697
We're now going to, in the projects

8
00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:36.857
component,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's

9
00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:41.410
introduce a form, so it's already in here.

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.087
So form, and it comes down to here.

11
00:00:45.087 --> 00:00:49.390
So we're encapsulating the card
content and the buttons here.

12
00:00:52.762 --> 00:00:56.082
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
the first thing that we can do,

13
00:00:56.082 --> 00:01:01.070
because this is a form,
is we can hook in a submit.

14
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:07.610
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Event and
we're just going to go saveProject.

15
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.589
And we'll go with, is it selectedProject?

16
00:01:13.589 --> 00:01:14.930
Yes, here we go.

17
00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:20.853
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so
when we start to fill this form out, that,

18
00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:24.202
because we have a submit
button when we hit Enter,

19
00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:28.260
it's going to capture that event and
call saveProject.

20
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.986
So,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There is

21
00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:37.651
a reason why I'm being
slightly opaque here.

22
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:43.023
SaveProject, we'll take the project, and
we're going to do something in a moment.

23
00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:46.030
Saving project.

24
00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:51.699
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
then we'll just trace the cell.

25
00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:56.165
So now in our component here,

26
00:01:56.165 --> 00:02:01.130
let's build out the form.

27
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.639
Now, for the sake of time I'm just going
to really click top into the reference.

28
00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:11.072
I'm just going to pull one
of these elements off, and

29
00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:17.740
we'll go back into the code and
I talk about what I've just done.

30
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.963
So within the form,
I'm introducing the mat form field,

31
00:02:22.963 --> 00:02:26.598
so this is an Angular material element.

32
00:02:26.598 --> 00:02:32.079
And then within this form field,

33
00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:39.191
then we have mat input and
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're

34
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:42.130
binding to the value of the ngModel.

35
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.847
So I'm going to take this off for
just one moment, and let's let this build.

36
00:02:50.545 --> 00:02:52.970
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And then let's
come over here and check this out.

37
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.853
So, when you are using a form
element in Angular material,

38
00:02:58.853 --> 00:03:03.208
notice that you get some
kind of interesting

39
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:07.812
things that are happening
within this input.

40
00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:13.298
And so, this title here when you select,
how it animates up,

41
00:03:13.298 --> 00:03:19.320
notice that when you click out,
you are getting kind of this neat.

42
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.632
It's underlined,
you're selected, you're out,

43
00:03:22.632 --> 00:03:27.194
and
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So with that,

44
00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:31.982
because this is an input that we're

45
00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:36.769
gonna say, okay, for this field,

46
00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:42.689
I want to bind to selectedProject.title.

47
00:03:45.407 --> 00:03:47.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, let's save that.

48
00:03:56.917 --> 00:03:59.475
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
the reason why this is failing,

49
00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:02.640
so let me take this off real quick,
save it.

50
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.289
Go back to Projects, not a problem,
nothing's happening, totally fine.

51
00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:14.320
Because, up to this point,
we're only using Angular material.

52
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.228
But the minute that I put on ngModel,

53
00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:23.407
we need to add in the form
functionality to this.

54
00:04:23.407 --> 00:04:30.314
So as you can imagine,
as this has been super interesting today,

55
00:04:30.314 --> 00:04:35.070
that you need to import the forms module.

56
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.704
And so now once I save this,
we go back here, save this.

57
00:04:46.125 --> 00:04:49.978
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let me make
sure I imported this correct.

58
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.485
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is why.

59
00:05:00.125 --> 00:05:01.177
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: On
the projects module,

60
00:05:05.352 --> 00:05:06.118
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go,

61
00:05:06.118 --> 00:05:07.168
I'll save this.

62
00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:22.510
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We select this, there
we go, so notice that it's filling it out.

63
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.540
Let me just refresh this.

64
00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.480
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That's interesting
behavior, but nonetheless, here we go.

65
00:05:34.664 --> 00:05:37.590
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
I'm curious why, if we go back.

66
00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:51.248
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
notice, whats happening here,

67
00:05:51.248 --> 00:05:56.083
is because this is asynchronous, and

68
00:05:56.083 --> 00:06:03.200
we're binding to selectedProject,
well guess what?

69
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.096
SelectedProject doesn't exist yet.

70
00:06:07.096 --> 00:06:13.836
So, what I would do here, and
there's a few ways to solve this, but

71
00:06:13.836 --> 00:06:19.160
I'm going to jump straight
to typically how when I'm

72
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.980
sharing a form that I'm creating
something and updating something.

73
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:33.975
Is that I will keep an empty project,

74
00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:38.042
object in this case.

75
00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:54.209
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
we'll just go const emptyProject, and

76
00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:59.159
we will cast this to a project so
we know that what it is.

77
00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:06.206
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And from here,
we're gonna say, id is null,

78
00:07:06.206 --> 00:07:11.154
title is just an empty string,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What other

79
00:07:11.154 --> 00:07:13.120
properties around here?

80
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.055
Just jump in and see here, not to bad.

81
00:07:23.457 --> 00:07:24.532
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So details,

82
00:07:24.532 --> 00:07:29.330
we'll just set everything to
kind of some defaults here.

83
00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:39.230
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then
we can do as well this.

84
00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:57.219
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: selectedProject =,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Or let's do this.

85
00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:02.160
selectProject, so we're only doing
it in one place, emptyProject.

86
00:08:08.557 --> 00:08:11.269
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
any time this page loads,

87
00:08:11.269 --> 00:08:16.360
we just reset the project,
as well as when we cancel.

88
00:08:19.487 --> 00:08:20.450
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll reset as well.

89
00:08:22.455 --> 00:08:23.000
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

90
00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:31.496
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And notice,

91
00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:36.710
everything is rendering because this is
being initialized to an empty project.
