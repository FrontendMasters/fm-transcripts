00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Look what happens
when I start mutating this.

2
00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:21.214
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Everywhere.

3
00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:23.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And so
I'll go ahead and save this.

4
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.320
Notice here, good.

5
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.430
But it was that leaky mutation
that sets the stage for

6
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.430
component of an architecture, and how you
kind of deal with that particular issue?

7
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.720
But then how you start to structure
your applications at scale.

8
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.320
Yes?

9
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sorry,
I just did not see that.

10
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.065
What mutation were we observing on there?

11
00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:57.912
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: All right, so don't blink.

12
00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.251
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Again,
I'm not sure where to be looking.

13
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: On the left.

14
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They all say-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So I'm mutating the form, so

15
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.400
I'm changing the data structure.

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You just don't want that
to be represented in the final saved.

17
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Well, so if I change
it here, not only do I not want it,

18
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.090
you may not realize it but
you definitely don't want it.

19
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570
You don't want to change
something in one place and

20
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.660
have it change in the title And
down here in the projects list.

21
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.310
And so this is a very obvious example, but

22
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.760
this happens all the time in
applications where you have shared,

23
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.480
mutable state, where you have, for
instance, an object in a service.

24
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.560
You're passing by reference
across two components and

25
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.310
one component is like,
this can never go up to past ten.

26
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.921
And the other component's like, I'm
a rock star, I'm gonna turn this to 11.

27
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:56.090
And all of a sudden, boom,
you've got a problem.

28
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.357
Or you're expecting something to be in
a certain state, but something over here,

29
00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:05.496
because the right hand doesn't
know what the left hand is doing,

30
00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:08.227
then you get into an unpredictable state.

31
00:02:08.227 --> 00:02:13.545
Because somewhere somebody else has done
something that you weren't aware of.

32
00:02:13.545 --> 00:02:16.326
And so this is, I think, a very,
okay, to my seven-year-old son, Dad,

33
00:02:16.326 --> 00:02:18.157
what's state mutation or
shared mutable state?

34
00:02:18.157 --> 00:02:19.094
I'm like, well, let me show you.

35
00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:25.014
We come here and I'll be like, see,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

36
00:02:25.014 --> 00:02:26.800
I type it here,
you see how it's here and here.

37
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.044
So very simple, but don't be like,

38
00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:36.512
it's kind of a simple example,
but it's indicative of something.

39
00:02:36.512 --> 00:02:39.350
It appears benign but it's not at all.

40
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.290
It's very,
very dangerous in your application

41
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.110
when you have state that can be
mutated in more than one place.
