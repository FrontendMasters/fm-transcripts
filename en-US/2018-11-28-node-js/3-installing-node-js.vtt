00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So what we're gonna
do now is we're gonna install Node.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.018
So if you already have Node,

3
00:00:04.018 --> 00:00:06.738
then congratulations you
already installed Node.

4
00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:07.309
Yes.

5
00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:08.859
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there
a version you want us to be on?

6
00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:10.058
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yep,
we're gonna get into that.

7
00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:16.021
It's gonna be the latest,
which is like ten something, anything ten.

8
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:19.464
But so there's two ways, okay, there
might be a lot of ways to install Node.

9
00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:23.712
But there's really only two ways to
install Node and there actually is

10
00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:28.640
only one way to install Node and
that is to use NVM, node version manager.

11
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.640
That is my recommended
way to install Node.

12
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.230
If you were to Google how to install Node.

13
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.990
That might not be the first thing to come
up, because obviously, what would probably

14
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.160
come up is installing it from the Node
source, from the Node website, and

15
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.000
they have an installer,
they have all this amazing stuff.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.600
You could totally do that, and
actually that's fine for this course,

17
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.340
cuz we're only gonna stick to one version.

18
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.500
But going forward,
as someone who's developing for Node, and

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.250
has seen a lot of different things,

20
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.680
you will avoid tons of issues if you
just install what node version manager.

21
00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.920
So we re going to go over the differences.

22
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.043
So if you installed from the node source,
like I said,

23
00:01:01.043 --> 00:01:02.393
it's the easiest way to install.

24
00:01:02.393 --> 00:01:06.937
They have an installer for your computer,
like a gooey, install everything for you,

25
00:01:06.937 --> 00:01:08.006
it's super legit.

26
00:01:08.006 --> 00:01:09.240
You can't mess it up.

27
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.348
It works on pretty much
any operating system.

28
00:01:12.348 --> 00:01:15.939
But it kind of limits your options for
having many versions of Node,

29
00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.310
because it installs in one
root place on your computer.

30
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.020
And that's it.

31
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.170
You can't put another version there
without having to manually do things, so

32
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.190
that kind of sucks and
it could cause permission errors.

33
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.970
There's some things that you have
to do with Node when it comes to

34
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.450
installing modules.

35
00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.875
Globally, and sometimes it needs
higher level permissions for

36
00:01:33.875 --> 00:01:37.070
that,and then you have to start
doing all this sudo stuff.

37
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.770
And it just messes everything up, so

38
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.690
I highly recommend not doing it from
the node source, although it works.

39
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.971
For this course you just won't have
any of those problems most likely.

40
00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.686
But what I do recommend is
using node version manager and

41
00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:52.330
that's because it allows you to run
mini versions of node whenever.

42
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.590
So because the thing about
Node is that some modules

43
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.260
might only work for some version, or

44
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.790
you might be deploying to this cloud
provider and it only has this version.

45
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.048
You need to be able to
switch versions sometimes.

46
00:02:06.048 --> 00:02:09.953
And being able to do that,
which is one command from your terminal,

47
00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:11.057
is super awesome.

48
00:02:11.057 --> 00:02:13.490
NVM allows you to do that, so you can just
download as many versions as you want.

49
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.009
And it's like, all right,
use this one now or use this one.

50
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:20.007
And it doesn't mess up permissions and
it kinda encapsulates everything.

51
00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:22.700
And it's super useful,
especially for testing.

52
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.990
I use this for testing all the time.

53
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.620
I'm like, I've gotta test it against this
version, test it against this version,

54
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.540
test it against this version,
test against this version, and that's it.

55
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.909
I'm not gonna go below this version.

56
00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.598
So I highly recommend doing that.

57
00:02:33.598 --> 00:02:36.223
So you don't have to do it right now, but
we're gonna get to the exercise part and

58
00:02:36.223 --> 00:02:36.930
we're gonna break.

59
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.340
And everybody can start installing it.

60
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.070
But if you want to get a head start,
like go ahead.

61
00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.100
Maybe, you know,
it might take a while, probably not.

62
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.640
But yeah, we're gonna keep going for
a little bit.

63
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.050
Any questions on installing node?

64
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.151
There's more, the links to these are gonna
be in the readme for the source and

65
00:02:54.151 --> 00:02:54.752
the NVM.

66
00:02:54.752 --> 00:02:57.640
And I'm gonna walk through both of them
after we, when we get to the exercise.

67
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.190
How to do them a little bit.

68
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.080
The installer one is super easy,
literally watch me through it.

69
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.362
NVM 1 might take some commands,
but we're gonna walk through it.

70
00:03:06.362 --> 00:03:08.810
Any other questions on installation?

71
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.923
You can also use docker, if you want to.

72
00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:14.990
I mean, if you really want docker.

73
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.138
If you use docker and you want to just
not have a node on your computer for

74
00:03:18.138 --> 00:03:20.380
whatever reason,
then you just want to virtualize it,

75
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.900
you can put it into docker and
download the docker temp.

76
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.522
We are not gonna go over that on this
course, cuz that's a whole other thing,

77
00:03:25.522 --> 00:03:27.327
but that is another way to install it.

78
00:03:27.327 --> 00:03:30.721
That's literally another way to install
everything, but we're not gonna do that.
