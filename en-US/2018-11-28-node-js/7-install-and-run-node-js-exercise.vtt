&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so Exercise 1, like
I said, we're gonna get to this exercise.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.489
You're gonna install Node on your machine.

3
00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:08.790
You're gonna verify your installation.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.200
And the way you verify is
both of those command work.

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.960
You should be able to type in node and
you should see a REPL.

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.554
If you type in node and
it says I have no idea what Node is,

7
00:00:17.554 --> 00:00:19.998
open up a new window in your terminal and
then try it.

8
00:00:19.998 --> 00:00:23.310
And if it still doesn't work, then your
installation is corrupted or something.

9
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.430
So we'll have to figure it out.

10
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.680
Use the Node REPL and
write some JavaScript.

11
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.440
Do a log, do whatever you want,
just write some JavaScript so

12
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.790
you know that it's working.

13
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.350
And then use the Node CLI executable
against a JavaScript file.

14
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.300
So just write a JavaScript file, it could
literally, like I said, be a console log.

15
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.170
It could be anything, just
the JavaScript that you know and love.

16
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.770
Write something in a file and then use
the Node CLI to execute that file.

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.770
You can save it on your desktop,
wherever you want to do it.
