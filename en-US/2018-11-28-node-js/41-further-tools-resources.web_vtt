WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.954
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So the last thing I wanna
leave you guys with is something,

2
00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:06.751
just like next step, something to sink
your teeth into things you should be

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:09.186
trying to learn and
things you can just ignore.

4
00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:13.200
And I think of myself as someone who's
aside really invested in the community.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.778
And where the community is going and
the tools that they're building and

6
00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:16.547
how they're doing.

7
00:00:16.547 --> 00:00:20.662
I'm literally the person that's on,
I have a slide that subscribes to GitHub,

8
00:00:20.662 --> 00:00:23.263
to specific things that I
read like ten times a day,

9
00:00:23.263 --> 00:00:26.493
just to see what people are doing
on GitHub, I'm that person.

10
00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:29.985
So I'm really crazy about what's
happening on GitHub and Open Source.

11
00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:34.376
So here is what I recommend,
I would imagine a lot people use node for

12
00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:35.609
specific things,

13
00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.710
specially if they work in companies
probably do something with like service.

14
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.996
Probably some server thing or
some built tools.

15
00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:45.141
Either they're upgrading
their frontend tech stack and

16
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:46.532
they're using some new framework.

17
00:00:46.532 --> 00:00:49.894
I need to learn how to use a build tool or
they're like building some API and

18
00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:51.316
they will learn how to do that.

19
00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:56.296
So what I would recommend is one
learning Express, so check out express.

20
00:00:56.296 --> 00:01:00.342
We have a course here that I taught
that talks about how to use Express and

21
00:01:00.342 --> 00:01:01.363
stuff like that.

22
00:01:01.363 --> 00:01:04.378
So I highly recommend
learning how to use Express.

23
00:01:04.378 --> 00:01:06.918
It's the framework you
used on the last exercise.

24
00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:09.024
That was a server framework
on how to build APIs.

25
00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:14.406
I heavily recommend learning how to build
APIs with Express and change of life.

26
00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:21.152
The next thing I recommend looking in
to other than like service side stuff.

27
00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:26.252
Would be common things you use for
build tools, so like Webpack.

28
00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:29.013
Webpack is probably the best one,
they're pretty legit.

29
00:01:29.013 --> 00:01:31.285
I mean it kinda just changed
how everything works.

30
00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.220
Like I said they allow you to
convert anything into a module.

31
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.559
I mean any file you can think of
could be a module, a JavaScript file,

32
00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:41.283
a handlebar file, common JS,
SASS, Jpeg JPEG, PNG.

33
00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:45.987
I'm thinking like I don't
understand what that means,

34
00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:49.127
why would I require a JPEG into my app?

35
00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:50.098
Why would I do that?

36
00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:53.380
Trust me just learn your Webpack
it will change how you build apps.

37
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.042
I just can't imagine building or
front an app today without using Webpack.

38
00:01:57.042 --> 00:01:59.907
I just cannot think of how it would work.

39
00:01:59.907 --> 00:02:04.871
So yeah, learn to do this and
this is really great.

40
00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:09.083
I think we have a course on
this too Mark for Webpack, yes.

41
00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.777
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sean Larkin
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, Sean Larkin,

42
00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:13.457
he's like the Webpack.

43
00:02:13.457 --> 00:02:15.332
Yeah, he's part of the Webpack team.

44
00:02:15.332 --> 00:02:17.269
So if anybody is gonna teach Webpack,
it's that guy.

45
00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.165
Very amazing talented guy,
highly recommend you watch that course.

46
00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:24.926
Yes, I need to watch it, now, that I'm
thinking about it it's pretty dope.

47
00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:29.074
Yeah, so Webpack, Express, and-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: As somebody who struggled

48
00:02:29.074 --> 00:02:32.089
with Webpack, I watched that course, and

49
00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:35.796
I was able to set up a bunch
of custom Webpack setups.

50
00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:37.019
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Nice.

51
00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.641
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: After that pretty quickly.

52
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:39.593
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: He's a good teacher.

53
00:02:39.593 --> 00:02:41.052
He's definitely one of
my favorite teachers.

54
00:02:41.052 --> 00:02:42.058
That dude is pretty legit.

55
00:02:42.058 --> 00:02:44.701
Nice guy too, very nice.

56
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:49.894
So yeah, Express, Webpack and then if you
wanna do more CLI things then you can

57
00:02:49.894 --> 00:02:55.421
check out Commander which we already used,
but just so you know what it looks like.

58
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:56.434
Commander is pretty legit.

59
00:02:56.434 --> 00:02:57.556
There's other ones out there.

60
00:02:57.556 --> 00:03:00.963
We're using another one at my company,
but it's super advanced so

61
00:03:00.963 --> 00:03:02.469
I'm not gonna recommend it.

62
00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:06.078
This one's pretty easy to work with,
so if you wanna see a light stuff,

63
00:03:06.078 --> 00:03:07.716
Commander is a really good one.

64
00:03:07.716 --> 00:03:09.962
And there's just tons of
other modules out there but

65
00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:12.370
I highly recommend just
pinning on what you're doing.

66
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.476
If you're trying to build some APIs,
learn Express.

67
00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:17.839
If you're trying to build some funding
tools and observations, learn Webpack.

68
00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.149
If you're trying to build some CLIs,
learn Commander.

69
00:03:21.364 --> 00:03:25.626
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Other than that,
the only the other stuff I would be on

70
00:03:25.626 --> 00:03:29.335
the lookout for or
to learn is actually Babel.

71
00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:33.094
So if you haven't learned Babel,
you heard me mention it a couple of times,

72
00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:35.640
it's the compiler for
the next JavaScript stuff.

73
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.171
So if you go to babel.js.io/repl, you can
write some code in here on the left and

74
00:03:40.171 --> 00:03:43.203
you can see what it looks
like on the right, all right?

75
00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:47.114
So if I wrote some code
here like function-

76
00:03:49.671 --> 00:03:52.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Const add = async, and

77
00:03:52.045 --> 00:03:57.524
I wanna see what that looks
like over here on the right.

78
00:03:57.524 --> 00:03:58.509
That's what it looks like.

79
00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:01.297
[LAUGH] It looks like that.

80
00:04:01.297 --> 00:04:03.685
So yeah, it does all that for you.

81
00:04:03.685 --> 00:04:07.411
So yeah, it uses a generator,
which is ridiculous, and

82
00:04:07.411 --> 00:04:09.828
a Y loop and all types of crazy stuff.

83
00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:14.313
So yeah, Babel is pretty cool, I use it
on node all the time to allow me to write

84
00:04:14.313 --> 00:04:17.765
future versions of JavaScript
that just aren't here yet.

85
00:04:17.765 --> 00:04:22.018
So really, really cool stuff.

86
00:04:22.018 --> 00:04:24.304
Other than that, yeah, just explore npm.

87
00:04:24.304 --> 00:04:27.799
If you get lost on npm,
try out some new modules,

88
00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:30.450
crazy new models contribute to npm.

89
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.420
If you got ideas let them be out
there pushing them out there,

90
00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.700
it doesn't matter if
people don't use them.

91
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.540
And yeah, push yourself make some
really cool stuff with node.

92
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.834
I promise you if you could think
of it you can make it with no de.

93
00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:42.848
It just really isn't a limit to it.

94
00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:44.186
Unless you're trying to
do Machine Learning.

95
00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:47.502
Then yeah, you could do it,
but I wouldn't do it.
