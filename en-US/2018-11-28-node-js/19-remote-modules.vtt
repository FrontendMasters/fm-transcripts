00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Cool,
Remote Modules, the cool stuff.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.440
So, what are remote modules?

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.790
Basically, you can download it and
use other modules from the internet.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.010
That's basically it.

5
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.728
You want some modules
that somebody else made?

6
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:15.393
Cuz most likely if you're
making an app in Node,

7
00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:19.310
I'm 99% sure you're gonna use
some modules from the internet.

8
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.240
I just don't know how
you wouldn't honestly?

9
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.250
Maybe that sounds bad saying
that.out loud, but yeah.

10
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.100
You would be so inefficient to
write anything big in Node and

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.900
not download a module that
makes it easy for you.

12
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.095
It just would suck.

13
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:36.495
There's some things where it's like,
yeah, I can make this myself.

14
00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:39.776
But it's just easier to just pull
something in that's already tested,

15
00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:44.000
that somebody already build, a lot of
people are already using and just use it.

16
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.521
So Node.js has grown a bunch, and a bunch
of that growth is due to the community and

17
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:53.213
the ability to share modules and
consume them at will.

18
00:00:53.213 --> 00:00:55.440
Literally whenever you want,
just pull it down.

19
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.910
You can slap together an app really
fast by reusing public modules,

20
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.670
which are the same as modules you make,
but they're packaged for downloading.

21
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.210
So we've been making modules like

22
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.630
what you just made on the last exercise
because every file's a module.

23
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.930
But just because it's a module,

24
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.995
that doesn't mean it's ready to be
used by another app by someone else.

25
00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:17.120
You gotta do some specific
things to get that to happen,

26
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.710
they can't just plug into your machine and
take your code.

27
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.900
You're not gonna e-mail them a folder
with your modules like here,

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.170
that's just gross right?

29
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.340
That's really bad,
there has to be a better way.

30
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.660
So like I said,

31
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.010
it sounds nice but you also have to
be aware of malicious code right?

32
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.600
If you're downloading
code from the internet,

33
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.630
you need to do some diligence
to make sure it's not bad, and

34
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.960
there's some couple things you
can do that we'll go over.

35
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.430
But yeah, it really is
sometimes you just don't know.

36
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.380
Hopefully somebody writes a Medium post
about it later and warn everybody, but

37
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.470
that's about it.

38
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.724
You'd be surprised,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: It is very dangerous, but

39
00:01:51.724 --> 00:01:54.910
people use Node modules all the time.

40
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.030
They're trying to fix it now and
it's getting really crazy,

41
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.120
but, yeah, it's just really bad.

42
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.749
Also, you need a system to help with
the management of the remote modules.

43
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.863
So again, you can't just e-mail
folders and modules around,

44
00:02:07.863 --> 00:02:11.209
so there has to be something you
need to help uploading and updating,

45
00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.228
updating versions, and
downloading and locking versions.

46
00:02:14.228 --> 00:02:17.625
You need something to manage
all of that efficiently, so

47
00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.407
there is something for that.
