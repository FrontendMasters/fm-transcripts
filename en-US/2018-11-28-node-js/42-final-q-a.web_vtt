1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.890
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, that's it.

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.680
I wanna thank you all for
coming to my course, and

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.910
if there's any other questions ask me now,
yes?

4
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.122
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You recommend node.js or
Express for

5
00:00:10.122 --> 00:00:13.880
building CMS or ecommerce sites?

6
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.840
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so you might
not have heard of this product, but

7
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.600
if you go to tipe.io it's
literally a CMS that's

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.750
built with node, but
it's kind of more than a CMS.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.810
But yeah,
actually I do recommend doing that.

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.700
I think the thing about a CMS is
that the difficult part is not

11
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.170
The difficult part about CMS is
the database, it's the data model, right?

12
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.950
It's how do you model,
especially if you're CMS is dynamic.

13
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.830
If you allow people to make custom types,
right,

14
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.070
if you allow them to do something
like that, then it gets really crazy.

15
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.470
So I think the CMS challenge
is a database choice, but

16
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.210
node I think is the best choice for
CMS because at the end of the day,

17
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.030
your CMS has a front end component, right?

18
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.410
You don't have a CMS for mobile.

19
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.830
Almost nobody has that
it's mostly on the web.

20
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.840
So the web is built with JavaScript if
your server was also built in JavaScript,

21
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.370
you can do more interesting things
like server-side universal rendering

22
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.410
you do a lot more crazier optimizations.

23
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.450
You can do AB testing you can do all
the stuff you would have liked to

24
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.050
done in like PHP and WordPress, but
now you can also do it in JavaScript.

25
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.640
So for that I do recommend using
something like note on the server.

26
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.270
For your CMS because you
kinda get that same feel

27
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.510
where you were doing all
this embedded stuff in PHP,

28
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.570
you can do that JavaScript now with
a universal framework but it's JavaScript.

29
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.630
So I highly recommend doing that
because it's really good at that, but

30
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.760
still put your assets
on the CDN somewhere.

31
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.913
Don't be serving assets from a note
server, just cache them somewhere.

32
00:01:37.913 --> 00:01:39.927
But yeah type is a CMS.

33
00:01:39.927 --> 00:01:41.540
You should check it out.

34
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.110
Don't build one.

35
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.012
Just use this one.

36
00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:45.060
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you don't need the GUI

37
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.070
like Gatsby is getting a lot of
popularity when it comes to.

38
00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.700
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah Gatsby
is really amazing.

39
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.390
One of the best out there.

40
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.410
Kyle and the guys behind that
team is just like pretty legit.

41
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.400
They have like a static site generator
that's like powered by Graph QL.

42
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.430
We're doing a lot of
integrations with them, and

43
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.410
they're kinda changing
the game of how things work.

44
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.030
And there's tons of other ones out there.

45
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.030
One that we like to use is called Nuxt.

46
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.210
Nuxt is and look, there's our logo.

47
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.030
Nuxt is a framework built around Vue.

48
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.880
It's one of the best
frameworks I've ever used.

49
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.500
So it's Vue, but
a framework on top of that framework.

50
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.350
It's service side rendering, universal,
static side, single bridge application,

51
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.550
you name it, they got it.

52
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.700
They even handle animations and
transitions.

53
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.890
Pretty much everything you
can think of they handle it.

54
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.170
And they're really good it's one
of the best frameworks I've used.

55
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.510
So we use them, they're pretty legit.

56
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.110
And yeah, there's just a lot of them.

57
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.990
Gatsby's good, Nuxt is good.

58
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.540
If you like React you might
want to check out Next.js.

59
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.000
I don't know if people still use this or
not.

60
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.291
I just don't keep up with
React like I used to.

61
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.090
But Next is pretty good.

62
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.275
There's a lot of optimism.

63
00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:56.430
Yeah, Next.js 7 is out so
it looks like they're still working on it.

64
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.085
The team behind Next is
a really strong team.

65
00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:02.127
A really strong developer so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What I understood like

66
00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:05.916
Nuxt and Next are very similar but
are more for

67
00:03:05.916 --> 00:03:10.803
like dynamic applications
versus something view press or

68
00:03:10.803 --> 00:03:15.604
Gatsby just like static
generators not dynamic server.

69
00:03:15.604 --> 00:03:17.300
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, so Next I'm.

70
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.610
I don't know the state of Next,
but Next came out first.

71
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.260
And then Nuxt copied Next and made Nuxt.

72
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.980
They just replaced the E with U.

73
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.550
But I don't know what Next can,
but with Nuxt,

74
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.480
you can generate static if you want to.

75
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.350
You can just say,
just make a static site and

76
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.990
I'm done it doesn't have to be dynamic.

77
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.360
So they have those options.

78
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.520
And that's why I like it, is you can like
if you've ever built a app that had to

79
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.520
work in different modes like universal,
single page, static,

80
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.280
it's a pain to get all
those modes to work.

81
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.340
Whereas you can just do it with a flag
with a CLI like universal or just deploy

82
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.720
static or actually this is a single page
application or this is just pure server.

83
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.760
All the different four different
types of modes they'll allow you

84
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.780
to do it with one flag.

85
00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.288
And that's why I like using them.

86
00:03:59.288 --> 00:04:03.470
Gatsby is strictly just for static sites,
which are becoming more dynamic every

87
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.380
single day, because everything's on
a cloud now, cloud made up websites.

88
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.790
But yeah, all those are really good
options, so really cool stuff.

89
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.590
Cool, all right, everyone, I appreciate
you coming out to the course, and

90
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.470
I hope you learn how to
do some node things.

91
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.230
And hit me up on Twitter,
whatever email me if you got some stuff

92
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.700
you want me to contribute to or
some stuff to check out or

93
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.590
if there's some cool stuff you
want to show me like let me know.

94
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.810
I'm down to like check out cool stuff and
and promote all types of things.

95
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.460
So yeah, let me know.

96
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.528
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Last thing I'll mention
is check out Scott's next course.

97
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:39.733
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Which is the API design.

98
00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:41.116
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes, yes.

99
00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:44.643
So if you want to go to the next
level check out the next course which

100
00:04:44.643 --> 00:04:48.520
is API design where we take express,
we go a little deeper with rest.

101
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.083
We also do some graph ql things there.

102
00:04:50.083 --> 00:04:53.539
If you have never used graph ql it's
pretty interesting, but we go a lot more

103
00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:57.490
into detail about that React connecting
with mongo and doing database things.

104
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.229
Sorta taken just a little step
further of how to build an API, and

105
00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:01.467
that course is already out.

106
00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.499
So feel free to check that out and
most of patterns that I use in that course

107
00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.730
is actually what we use every day
in my company that I built myself.

108
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.320
So those are real world patterns and
not so

109
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.220
much super intro to very specific,
very practical things.

110
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.405
So if you want to get down to nitty-gritty
to building applications, yeah,

111
00:05:18.405 --> 00:05:19.243
check that one out.

112
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.912
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
