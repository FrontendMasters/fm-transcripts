00:00:00.488 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt; Scott: And that's it.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:05.883
So now I'm gonna go over the two
different types of installations.

3
00:00:05.883 --> 00:00:09.592
Just very briefly, so
you can kinda just see them and

4
00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:13.398
talk about any issues you might run into,
maybe not.

5
00:00:13.398 --> 00:00:16.672
Let me get out of this full screen
mode very quick, there we go.

6
00:00:16.672 --> 00:00:24.153
So for Nodejs, you go to nodejs.org.

7
00:00:24.153 --> 00:00:26.697
You click on Downloads.

8
00:00:26.697 --> 00:00:31.109
And you'll see this thing where
it says LTS and then Current.

9
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.117
Sometimes, it'll be the same,
sometimes, they won't.

10
00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:37.604
But LTS means Lifetime Support.

11
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:42.626
So the way that Node versions Node,
the Node community versions

12
00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:47.373
Node is that every other major
version is lifetime support.

13
00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:49.194
So it's like almost every even version.

14
00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:53.746
So you can see latest LTS versions 8.2,
or I'm sorry, 8.12.

15
00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:56.570
But the current version is 10 something.

16
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.476
So that means there's a version
9 somewhere that it's not LTS.

17
00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:02.471
It's basically like, you can use this
version, but we're not gonna support it

18
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:05.393
forever, because there's some stuff
here that we don't really care about.

19
00:01:05.393 --> 00:01:07.010
The next version after this
we'll support forever.

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.341
So it's how they can try out new features
without locking themselves into it and

21
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:13.223
shooting themselves in the foot.

22
00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:17.361
And again, all this is because
forked Node and created this chaos.

23
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:21.212
So it was so good, it was so good.

24
00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:23.005
Yes, LTS is lifetime support.

25
00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:25.658
Current is whatever
the current version is.

26
00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:29.037
We're just gonna do the current one,
because the current one is 10, and that's

27
00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:32.243
most likely gonna be lifetime support,
because it's two versions after 8.

28
00:01:32.243 --> 00:01:33.899
So just do the current one.

29
00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.070
I'm trying to think, yeah, actually,
you have to do the current one.

30
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.593
The exercise that I have, taking advantage
of only stuff that's in current.

31
00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:46.648
So don't do 8.12 because your
exercises might not work.

32
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:47.517
So do the current one.

33
00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:51.693
If you already installed Node prior
to this or if you already had it and

34
00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:54.431
it's not on 10, you need to install 10.

35
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:58.216
And if you did do that and you're not
using NVM you're probably gonna have

36
00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:00.608
a problem trying to
install another version.

37
00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:03.150
Because you're gonna upgrade
your version to 10 and

38
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.982
it might break stuff that you have now.

39
00:02:04.982 --> 00:02:07.894
So this is why NVM is great, because
you can just have another version and

40
00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.159
still have your old version and
not mess with anything.

41
00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:14.447
I recommend if you already have node
installed and it is not version 10 then

42
00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:18.878
wait till I get to the NVM instructions
and use NVM to install another version.

43
00:02:18.878 --> 00:02:23.018
If you're fine with just upgrading your
version to 10 because you don't really

44
00:02:23.018 --> 00:02:26.512
care, then just upgrade your version
to 10 and you should be fine.

45
00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:31.099
But yeah, so you'll click on Current and
you can see current is 10.11 and

46
00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.267
it says it includes npm 6.4.1.

47
00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:34.856
We'll talk about npm later.

48
00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:38.910
And basically, yeah,
these things have installers,

49
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.839
just pick on your logo, and
install it, and that's basically it.

50
00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.517
You don't really have to do anything else.

51
00:02:46.517 --> 00:02:52.133
So if you're going to do this version,
as far as installing it from the source.

52
00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.284
So it's pretty self-explanatory,
just download appropriate one for

53
00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:57.307
your machine and
let the installer do its job.

54
00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:59.940
For NVM,
we're gonna take a look at that one.
