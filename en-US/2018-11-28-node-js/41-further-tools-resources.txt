[00:00:00]
>> Speaker 1: So the last thing I wanna leave you guys with is something, just like next step, something to sink your teeth into things you should be trying to learn and things you can just ignore. And I think of myself as someone who's aside really invested in the community.

[00:00:13]
And where the community is going and the tools that they're building and how they're doing. I'm literally the person that's on, I have a slide that subscribes to GitHub, to specific things that I read like ten times a day, just to see what people are doing on GitHub, I'm that person.

[00:00:26]
So I'm really crazy about what's happening on GitHub and Open Source. So here is what I recommend, I would imagine a lot people use node for specific things, specially if they work in companies probably do something with like service. Probably some server thing or some built tools. Either they're upgrading their frontend tech stack and they're using some new framework.

[00:00:46]
I need to learn how to use a build tool or they're like building some API and they will learn how to do that. So what I would recommend is one learning Express, so check out express. We have a course here that I taught that talks about how to use Express and stuff like that.

[00:01:01]
So I highly recommend learning how to use Express. It's the framework you used on the last exercise. That was a server framework on how to build APIs. I heavily recommend learning how to build APIs with Express and change of life. The next thing I recommend looking in to other than like service side stuff.

[00:01:21]
Would be common things you use for build tools, so like Webpack. Webpack is probably the best one, they're pretty legit. I mean it kinda just changed how everything works. Like I said they allow you to convert anything into a module. I mean any file you can think of could be a module, a JavaScript file, a handlebar file, common JS, SASS, Jpeg JPEG, PNG.

[00:01:41]
I'm thinking like I don't understand what that means, why would I require a JPEG into my app? Why would I do that? Trust me just learn your Webpack it will change how you build apps. I just can't imagine building or front an app today without using Webpack. I just cannot think of how it would work.

[00:01:59]
So yeah, learn to do this and this is really great. I think we have a course on this too Mark for Webpack, yes.
>> Speaker 2: Sean Larkin
>> Speaker 1: Yeah, Sean Larkin, he's like the Webpack. Yeah, he's part of the Webpack team. So if anybody is gonna teach Webpack, it's that guy.

[00:02:17]
Very amazing talented guy, highly recommend you watch that course. Yes, I need to watch it, now, that I'm thinking about it it's pretty dope. Yeah, so Webpack, Express, and-
>> Speaker 2: As somebody who struggled with Webpack, I watched that course, and I was able to set up a bunch of custom Webpack setups.

[00:02:35]

>> Speaker 1: Nice.
>> Speaker 2: After that pretty quickly.
>> Speaker 1: He's a good teacher. He's definitely one of my favorite teachers. That dude is pretty legit. Nice guy too, very nice. So yeah, Express, Webpack and then if you wanna do more CLI things then you can check out Commander which we already used, but just so you know what it looks like.

[00:02:55]
Commander is pretty legit. There's other ones out there. We're using another one at my company, but it's super advanced so I'm not gonna recommend it. This one's pretty easy to work with, so if you wanna see a light stuff, Commander is a really good one. And there's just tons of other modules out there but I highly recommend just pinning on what you're doing.

[00:03:12]
If you're trying to build some APIs, learn Express. If you're trying to build some funding tools and observations, learn Webpack. If you're trying to build some CLIs, learn Commander.
>> Speaker 1: Other than that, the only the other stuff I would be on the lookout for or to learn is actually Babel.

[00:03:29]
So if you haven't learned Babel, you heard me mention it a couple of times, it's the compiler for the next JavaScript stuff. So if you go to babel.js.io/repl, you can write some code in here on the left and you can see what it looks like on the right, all right?

[00:03:43]
So if I wrote some code here like function-
>> Speaker 1: Const add = async, and I wanna see what that looks like over here on the right. That's what it looks like. [LAUGH] It looks like that. So yeah, it does all that for you. So yeah, it uses a generator, which is ridiculous, and a while loop and all types of crazy stuff.

[00:04:09]
So yeah, Babel is pretty cool, I use it on node all the time to allow me to write future versions of JavaScript that just aren't here yet. So really, really cool stuff. Other than that, yeah, just explore npm. If you get lost on npm, try out some new modules, crazy new models contribute to npm.

[00:04:30]
If you got ideas let them be out there pushing them out there, it doesn't matter if people don't use them. And yeah, push yourself make some really cool stuff with node. I promise you if you could think of it you can make it with no de. It just really isn't a limit to it.

[00:04:42]
Unless you're trying to do Machine Learning. Then yeah, you could do it, but I wouldn't do it.
