00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.005
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, and there are other
tools that aim to do the same thing.

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.865
So one of them is gonna be Yarn.

3
00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:07.697
That's the one that I use.

4
00:00:07.697 --> 00:00:08.695
So I use Yarn.

5
00:00:08.695 --> 00:00:13.176
Yarn is literally the same thing as NPM,
but it was made by Facebook.

6
00:00:13.176 --> 00:00:14.257
No, I don't like Facebook.

7
00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:16.126
I'm not trying to sell you on Facebook.

8
00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:18.099
I just really like Yarn.

9
00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.761
It literally does the same thing as NPM.

10
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:23.661
It even has the same command names,
cuz they want it to be easier to switch.

11
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:26.001
And that's basically what I use.

12
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:28.084
So, I would say yarn.

13
00:00:28.084 --> 00:00:31.502
Some of the differences there, you could
do yarn install, but I do yarn add.

14
00:00:31.502 --> 00:00:34.017
And I'll just add the name of it.

15
00:00:34.017 --> 00:00:36.654
Yarn add lodash and
it will do the same thing.

16
00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:39.403
The difference with yarn
is that up until recently,

17
00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:42.338
it's just been faster cuz it
uses a CDN to cache things,

18
00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:45.655
whereas, at the time,
when Yarn was made, NPM didn't do it.

19
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:48.136
NPM's doing it now, and
they're actually pretty fast.

20
00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:52.217
And also, Yarn, at the time,
was the only project that had some type of

21
00:00:52.217 --> 00:00:56.791
locking mechanism where I can lock
reversions of dependencies from changing.

22
00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:01.015
That way, not only did I have a
package.json that downloaded the modules,

23
00:01:01.015 --> 00:01:05.371
but I also was able to freeze them in
times, only this version, this module and

24
00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.238
nothing else.

25
00:01:06.238 --> 00:01:07.022
So Yarn did that.

26
00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:09.473
NPM does that now too
with the NPM shrink wrap.

27
00:01:09.473 --> 00:01:11.921
Or they might even have a lock file now.

28
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:12.954
But I haven't used NPM in a while.

29
00:01:12.954 --> 00:01:14.342
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Packagelog.json?

30
00:01:14.342 --> 00:01:15.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Packagelog.json,
there you go.

31
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.365
So NPM does now, so
it's funny how this community works.

32
00:01:18.365 --> 00:01:20.351
People will like,
fork things, make things.

33
00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:23.179
And then the original creator was like,
really?

34
00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.070
Well, we're gonna make ours better too.

35
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.520
That's literally what happened with NPM.

36
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.237
Yarn came out, NPM was just like, wow,
we can do that too, and overnight,

37
00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:31.621
they just did all this stuff.

38
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:32.800
So pretty legit.
