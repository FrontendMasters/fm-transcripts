00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.806
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So hope everyone had
a chance to make some progress on fixing

2
00:00:04.806 --> 00:00:07.061
this static access server.

3
00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:09.095
And if you got it done,
even better, that's awesome,

4
00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:10.410
without looking at the solutions.

5
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.650
Obviously the solution is there and
it's tempting.

6
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.060
But that's fine as long as you
can understand what's happening.

7
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.653
I'm gonna go through it and if you had any
questions, any roadblocks that you were

8
00:00:19.653 --> 00:00:22.690
stuck on, please bring them up,
and we'll explore this together.

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.950
Cool, so a few things happening here.

10
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.880
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
start the server to kind of see where

11
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.816
we left off.

12
00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:39.169
Again, so a couple of issues where
is if I start this, and I go

13
00:00:39.169 --> 00:00:46.524
to localhost:3000,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The HTML

14
00:00:46.524 --> 00:00:48.616
seems to get rendered just fine, right.

15
00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:53.152
And I could verify that if I go look
at the network tab in Chrome, and

16
00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.340
I click on Doc and hit a refresh.

17
00:00:58.014 --> 00:00:59.323
It broke cuz the server just restarted.

18
00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:00.550
Let me restart that.

19
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.840
There we go.

20
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.500
So here we go.

21
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.930
So it looks like it resolved
the HTML correctly, right?

22
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.497
I can look at the response,
the correct HTML.

23
00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:15.596
But then what happens is that in
that HTML file, there is a link tag,

24
00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:21.720
right, and if you know how the browser
works, it's gonna parse this HTML.

25
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.800
Then it's gonna look for other URLs for
link tags, other script tags, images,

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.831
anything that's in here, and it's gonna
send off requests for those assets.

27
00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:33.393
So one of the assets is style.css,
because that's not an absolute URL,

28
00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:34.484
it's a relative URL,

29
00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:38.790
it's gonna go to the same origin that this
index file came from, so your server.

30
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.525
And it's gonna say, hey, get request
style.css mime type whatever, right?

31
00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:47.606
It's gonna go to the server, and
in our servers, it doesn't handle that so

32
00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:50.176
it just freaks out and crashes,
and then the whole app breaks.

33
00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:53.000
So kind of a really bad experience,
definitely don't want that.

34
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.099
So we need to fix it.

35
00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.449
And then the other thing was that
the findAssets was synchronous.

36
00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:00.572
This is blocking.

37
00:02:00.572 --> 00:02:03.461
I mean, there's problems with reading
a file over and over and over again for

38
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:04.850
the same file that doesn't change.

39
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.806
That's one problem.

40
00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:07.022
We're not gonna about that problem.

41
00:02:07.022 --> 00:02:08.411
That's just a performance thing.

42
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:11.280
But two,
it's synchronous as in it's blocking.

43
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.955
If I load tested this with like a million
hits and started hitting this over and

44
00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:17.912
over and over again,
then it's definitely gonna slow down.

45
00:02:17.912 --> 00:02:21.128
Yeah, so if I was hitting
the findAsset function over and

46
00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:24.077
over again because it's
using fs.readFileSync,

47
00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:27.910
then this would definitely slow down,
this would be a bottleneck.

48
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.399
And if you did any type of load testing,

49
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:31.399
you would see the problem
would definitely be here.

50
00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:32.403
So you have to fix this.

51
00:02:32.403 --> 00:02:36.280
Or you want this to go in the background
because if this is synchronous, so

52
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.281
if this reads and it hits it and
another request comes in,

53
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:43.730
then the other request can't even be
registered until this one's done.

54
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.726
And if there's a queue, if you already got
into the back of the line of this queue

55
00:02:46.726 --> 00:02:49.931
and there's already like 1,000 in front
of you then now you're just waiting.

56
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:51.895
And eventually the server will
just be like [SOUND], I'm done.

57
00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:52.940
I can't handle this.

58
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.980
I ran out of memory.

59
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.800
I ran out of resources or whatever.

60
00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.620
I'm done.

61
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.160
So you don't want to do that.

62
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.360
So we need to make this asynchronous.

63
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.250
So let's start with that.

64
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.310
We'll make this asynchronous first.

65
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.917
So there's a couple ways we can do it.

66
00:03:03.917 --> 00:03:07.945
I demonstrated a little bit of it
when you started the exercise, but

67
00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:12.360
my approach is I like to use async
await so I'm gonna use async await.

68
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.476
So the first step is for
me to convert readFileSync into a promise.

69
00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:17.915
So I need to permissify that.

70
00:03:17.915 --> 00:03:20.010
I was gonna do it the manual way.

71
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.790
So first thing I'm gonna do is I'm just
going to copy that, get rid of it.

72
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.498
And then I'm just gonna return a Promise,
a new Promise,

73
00:03:28.498 --> 00:03:32.258
which takes a callback of resolve and
reject.

74
00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:35.221
This is how you make
a Promise out of anything.

75
00:03:35.221 --> 00:03:37.486
And then I'm going to
paste that back in here.

76
00:03:37.486 --> 00:03:42.180
Change it to readFile without the Sync.

77
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.341
Get rid of this .tostring and
then readFile takes a third argument,

78
00:03:45.341 --> 00:03:46.760
which is a callback.

79
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.080
Remember I said the callback pattern in
node is always error first, result second.

80
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.620
That's how it always is, so
this callback takes those two.

81
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.450
I didn't even have to look
cuz that's just how it works.

82
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.134
So now that I have those two things,

83
00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:05.443
I was going to say if(error),
then reject(error).

84
00:04:05.443 --> 00:04:06.949
And that's just how you do things for
promises.

85
00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:11.914
You reject errors and you resolve,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Your data

86
00:04:11.914 --> 00:04:14.120
if there is any data, so
in this case, Result.

87
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.518
So there we go.

88
00:04:16.518 --> 00:04:19.882
So now I just made findAsset
an asynchronous function that returns

89
00:04:19.882 --> 00:04:20.488
a promise.

90
00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:22.060
So that's good.

91
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.880
That's step one.

92
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.271
So now that it's an asynchronous promise,
I got to go to where I'm actually calling

93
00:04:26.271 --> 00:04:29.164
this function, findAsset, and
make sure it handles it accordingly.

94
00:04:29.164 --> 00:04:31.458
Cuz right now it still
thinks it's synchronous.

95
00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.741
So because it's a promise,
I have to resolve it.

96
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:37.781
I have to do a .then or
something like that.

97
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:42.431
So what I'm going to do now is,
the findAsset function is right here.

98
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.180
It's inside of res.writeHead.

99
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.840
And I kinda like the way it sits in here.

100
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.320
I don't wanna have to do a .then and

101
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.360
put all the rest of the code
inside of the .then.

102
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.560
I kinda just like it here on one line.

103
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.490
And this is why I wanna do async await.

104
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.710
So if I wanna put await here,
I have to go up to the function

105
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.520
that this code is in and
put an async in front of it.

106
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.260
And that function is here.

107
00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.840
So I put async here on this
callback function like that.

108
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.230
I can now just go ahead and
just put await right here.

109
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.300
And then I'm done.

110
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.380
Now that's an async function.

111
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.230
That's pretty cool that you
can put await right there?

112
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.720
You didn't have to do it on just
the other side of the equal sign.

113
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:20.890
You can put it anywhere.

114
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.700
So yeah, now I didn't really
have to change my code.

115
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.890
This still looks synchronous, but
it's actually asynchronous and

116
00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.355
all I had to do is change the async in
front of this callback function here and

117
00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:30.390
make this a promise.

118
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.520
So let's start that.

119
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.760
Let's see if it didn't break anything.

120
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.023
So the CSS file will still break,
but hopefully,

121
00:05:39.023 --> 00:05:42.750
yeah, this still seems to, wait.

122
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.138
Here we go.

123
00:05:44.138 --> 00:05:48.510
Yeah, so the CSS file still broke, but
it looks like it was able to get the HTML

124
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.020
file, but
then it just broke on the CSS file, so.

125
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.248
And you can see now, instead of it
just breaking and saying an error,

126
00:05:55.248 --> 00:05:56.472
you get this weird thing,

127
00:05:56.472 --> 00:05:59.310
UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning with
an Error.

128
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.000
The reason that's the case
is because whenever you put

129
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.670
async on any function, it basically
turns that function into a promise.

130
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.580
And because I just
randomly threw an error,

131
00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.340
I didn't catch it, I just threw it, that's
why Node's freaking out and saying, hey,

132
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.340
you had
an UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning.

133
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.474
So this function, which is now a promise,
cuz you put async in front of it,

134
00:06:25.474 --> 00:06:28.839
had an error called route not found and
you did not handle it.

135
00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:30.650
So that's the warning
that it's telling me.

136
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.230
It's like you had an error that was
thrown during some asynchronous thing and

137
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.340
you didn't handle it.

138
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.072
So you probably wanna know about that and
that's what it's saying right now.

139
00:06:39.072 --> 00:06:42.140
So that's a really good
tool to let us know.

140
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:45.380
So that's step one.

141
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.278
So the next thing we wanna do is we wanna
create some type of router to be able

142
00:06:50.278 --> 00:06:53.059
to handle all different types of assets.

143
00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:57.210
And then just silently fail if they don't
exist, so that's what we're gonna do.

144
00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.450
So my little quick router is just
gonna be something like this.

145
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.828
So I'm gonna say router.

146
00:07:03.828 --> 00:07:05.290
It's gonna be an object.

147
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.255
And then if you ever built a router, you
know there's usually a combination of at

148
00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:11.880
least two things you want to do for
a router.

149
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.237
The route and
then there's the verb, right?

150
00:07:14.237 --> 00:07:19.404
So you have, like, I did a git request to
/users or I did a post request to /users.

151
00:07:19.404 --> 00:07:21.460
So there's a combination of a route and
a verb.

152
00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.010
So I just wanna optimize for an efficient
lookup, so that's all I'm gonna do.

153
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.330
So I have two assets here,
I have an index.html asset and

154
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.810
I have a style.css asset.

155
00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.500
So I'm just gonna create routes for those.

156
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.580
So my convention is, if you do
a request to this path with a slash,

157
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.140
with this verb, GET,
then I'm just gonna put some stuff here.

158
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.554
If you do a request to

159
00:07:50.554 --> 00:07:57.230
style.css with the verb GET,
then I'm gonna do some stuff here.

160
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.540
So for this stuff here,
I just need two things.

161
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:04.785
I need the path to the asset so
I can have read file find it,

162
00:08:04.785 --> 00:08:07.007
and then I need the mime type.

163
00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:10.266
Anyone not know what a mime type is?

164
00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:15.460
A mime type is basically information
about what type of file that your

165
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:21.923
server is sending, so the consumer in this
case, a browser, knows how to render it.

166
00:08:21.923 --> 00:08:24.997
If we didn't tell the browser what
the mime type of an HTML was,

167
00:08:24.997 --> 00:08:29.480
it wouldn't know to render it as HTML,
it would just think it was a string.

168
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.210
If we didn't tell it that
the mime type was CSS,

169
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.050
it wouldn't know that it was CSS and
it would just render it as a string.

170
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.570
So we have to give it a mime type.

171
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.970
Every file has a mime type, so
those are the two things that are needed.

172
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:45.032
So I'm just gonna say asset, and
the path to index.html is just gonna be or

173
00:08:45.032 --> 00:08:48.030
the name's gonna say index.html.

174
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.752
And then I'm just gonna say mime.

175
00:08:50.752 --> 00:08:54.860
I don't wanna have to think
of what the mime type is.

176
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.990
Actually I know what the mime type is.

177
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.089
I've done this so
many times with HTML files.

178
00:08:58.089 --> 00:08:59.644
But it's kind of annoying to think of it.

179
00:08:59.644 --> 00:09:02.620
So this is where NPM comes in,
super legit.

180
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.800
I'm just going to install
something to help me out.

181
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.436
So as an exercise,
this is what I would do.

182
00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:16.434
I would literally just type in mime
npm on Google and see what comes up.

183
00:09:16.434 --> 00:09:18.175
Man, look at that.

184
00:09:18.175 --> 00:09:19.003
I'm gonna go here.

185
00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:24.540
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, seems pretty legit.

186
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.930
Six months ago,
it's not that popular, but I mean,

187
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.940
it's a Mime library, who uses this?

188
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:34.140
Still, the publish this year, yeah,
sure, I'll go ahead and install this.

189
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:40.140
So I'm just gonna say npm install mime,
and I'm gonna save that.

190
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.160
So I'll let that install, and
then I'm gonna go ahead and use it.

191
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:48.292
So I'm just gonna say const
mime = require('mime').

192
00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:52.528
And if you look at the documentation,
there's a function here called getType,

193
00:09:52.528 --> 00:09:56.970
and I'll just put the type of it and
it'll return the mime that I need for it.

194
00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.910
So that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

195
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:05.332
So for the mine type of an index.html
file, I'm gonna say mime.getType.

196
00:10:05.332 --> 00:10:07.330
And I'm gonna say it's html.

197
00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.639
So it'll put the right mime type there for
me.

198
00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:15.627
The same thing for the CSS,
asset, it's gonna be style.css.

199
00:10:18.487 --> 00:10:23.598
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then it's mime,
it's gonna be mime.getType, and css,

200
00:10:23.598 --> 00:10:28.913
or whatever that is,
which is text/css, this was text/html.

201
00:10:28.913 --> 00:10:31.970
So now I got the mimes, I got this stuff.

202
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.910
So now all I gotta do is
just look it up down here.

203
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.630
So we already have the method,
that's gonna be here.

204
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.070
We already have the route,
now it's gotta create some type of key.

205
00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:47.590
Which basically is just the route plus the
method with a space in between, that's it.

206
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:52.188
So what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna say key =,

207
00:10:52.188 --> 00:10:59.280
actually I'll just do this, found,
or I'll just call it match.

208
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.716
So a match is gonna be
router with the method.

209
00:11:09.442 --> 00:11:10.260
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And a space.

210
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.564
I'm sorry.
Not the method, but the route.

211
00:11:15.364 --> 00:11:17.861
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: With a space and
then a method.

212
00:11:19.727 --> 00:11:23.628
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, cuz again,
it's the route with a space and

213
00:11:23.628 --> 00:11:25.330
then the method.

214
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.740
That's the key.

215
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.190
So boom, that'll give me a match.

216
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.730
And then what I'll say is if not a match,

217
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.020
this is where we handle
stuff that's not a match.

218
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:39.939
I'll just copy this, paste it here.

219
00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:47.067
And then I'll say 404 and
I'll just say, I don't really need it.

220
00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:54.155
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Mime type there, definitely
not sending back anything there,

221
00:11:54.155 --> 00:11:59.566
I'll just say 404, and
I'll just log this 404, there we go.

222
00:11:59.566 --> 00:12:01.465
And then I'll just make sure I do
return so it doesn't continue.

223
00:12:04.555 --> 00:12:05.695
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So I got that part.

224
00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:09.318
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then everything else,
I don't have to do this check.

225
00:12:09.318 --> 00:12:12.900
I just get the match so
I can get rid of this if and this else.

226
00:12:15.034 --> 00:12:21.244
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And instead I can
just say 200 and then for the mime,

227
00:12:21.244 --> 00:12:27.601
which is Content- Type,
I'll just say match.mime.

228
00:12:27.601 --> 00:12:34.110
And then for the findAsset I can
just say match.asset and that's it.

229
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.470
Now have a router that can
serve different things.

230
00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.485
So let's test this.

231
00:12:41.485 --> 00:12:45.171
So we'll start the server.

232
00:12:45.171 --> 00:12:47.600
Didn't break, if something broke,
it would have blew up right now.

233
00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.614
So that's good.

234
00:12:49.614 --> 00:12:51.728
And then we'll refresh this and boom.

235
00:12:51.728 --> 00:12:54.443
You can see the CSS loaded up and
you can see it formatted and

236
00:12:54.443 --> 00:12:55.620
everything looks good.

237
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.498
There aren't any errors.

238
00:12:56.498 --> 00:13:00.560
So if we look at the Network tab, local
host loaded just fine, got the document.

239
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.060
See the CSS file, that loaded just fine.

240
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.650
So it seems to be working which is good.

241
00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:08.180
And if we go look at the server, you can
see we did a GET request, looked for

242
00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.530
a robots.txt.

243
00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:10.950
That's not there, clearly.

244
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:13.798
Did a GET request to index, got a 200.

245
00:13:13.798 --> 00:13:17.493
Did a GET request to style.css, got 200,
and looked for the robots.txt again and

246
00:13:17.493 --> 00:13:19.000
that's not there.

247
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.472
So it looks like our server started
serving our starting assets.

248
00:13:22.472 --> 00:13:27.212
So if we try to ask for something that's
not there, like something like that.

249
00:13:27.212 --> 00:13:30.699
You can see, I get back a 404.

250
00:13:30.699 --> 00:13:33.500
But the server's still running,
it didn't crash.

251
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:38.281
So we're good and we can test that out,
if I just go back to here,

252
00:13:38.281 --> 00:13:39.799
and it still works.

253
00:13:42.885 --> 00:13:44.903
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any questions on that?

254
00:13:44.903 --> 00:13:48.538
There's obviously some things you can do
here for a better user experience like if

255
00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:52.540
there's an error, instead of sending back
just a 404, sending back a not found page,

256
00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:54.877
right, an HTML page that's a 404 page,
right?

257
00:13:54.877 --> 00:13:56.396
You would do something like that instead.

258
00:13:56.396 --> 00:13:58.316
Or if you're doing
a single page application,

259
00:13:58.316 --> 00:14:01.100
you would just send back the index.html
for every single request and

260
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.688
have the browser take care
of the routing for you.

261
00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:08.734
But honestly, you probably won't
even build a static server in Node,

262
00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:12.028
although it's good at it,
it's not its job.

263
00:14:12.028 --> 00:14:15.553
You'll probably use something like
a CDN or something like that, or

264
00:14:15.553 --> 00:14:17.943
put NGINX in front of Node or
you just use a CDN.

265
00:14:17.943 --> 00:14:20.536
Only time you ever use Node for

266
00:14:20.536 --> 00:14:25.725
static assets now is probably
almost never, to be honest.

267
00:14:25.725 --> 00:14:28.440
Yeah, maybe for an IoT thing,
maybe that makes sense.

268
00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:32.410
If we're doing universal, you do some
type of processing on the server,

269
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.560
that makes sense, but everything else,
just use something that's better.

270
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.873
Specifically a CDN,
don't serve your static assets from

271
00:14:38.873 --> 00:14:43.686
a origin server somewhere in Canada, just
put it on a CDN so it's fast and cachable.

272
00:14:46.536 --> 00:14:48.833
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
a CDN can be written in JavaScript.

273
00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:51.464
So I guess technically
you can do it in Node?

274
00:14:51.464 --> 00:14:55.003
[LAUGH] Any questions on this?

275
00:14:55.003 --> 00:14:56.139
Anybody do this differently?

276
00:14:56.139 --> 00:14:57.050
I'm very interested.

277
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.566
How'd you do it?

278
00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:02.853
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I used
the Promisify utility.

279
00:15:02.853 --> 00:15:03.429
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Nice.

280
00:15:03.429 --> 00:15:06.884
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
wrapped the file read in that.

281
00:15:06.884 --> 00:15:10.976
I just said if you're looking for
slash, then you're looking for

282
00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:14.774
index.html, and
let the response figure out the mime type,

283
00:15:14.774 --> 00:15:15.538
cuz-
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There you go.

284
00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:16.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just under CSS.

285
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.120
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let it do its job.

286
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.088
Yeah, yeah, I like that, cool.

287
00:15:19.088 --> 00:15:20.510
Anything else?

288
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.051
Who else did something a little different?

289
00:15:25.895 --> 00:15:28.903
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No,
everything was just like this?

290
00:15:28.903 --> 00:15:30.542
Exactly like this?

291
00:15:30.542 --> 00:15:32.336
[LAUGH] That's all right.

292
00:15:32.336 --> 00:15:34.401
Any questions?

293
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:38.000
Is anybody just really stuck on something
and they just couldn't get past it?

294
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.779
What was the biggest challenge?

295
00:15:43.631 --> 00:15:48.014
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Was it the router or was
it the asynchronous non-blocking stuff?

296
00:15:48.014 --> 00:15:52.045
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My first attempt was to turn
the findAsset call into an asynchronous

297
00:15:52.045 --> 00:15:56.653
function and then try and kind of wait
inside that and then return the result.

298
00:15:56.653 --> 00:15:57.207
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

299
00:15:57.207 --> 00:15:59.473
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
that always returned an unsettled promise.

300
00:15:59.473 --> 00:16:01.643
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right, because then
you got to handle that too, right?

301
00:16:01.643 --> 00:16:07.162
Because, if findAssets is waiting
on something asynchronous,

302
00:16:07.162 --> 00:16:10.020
then now it too is asynchronous.

303
00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:12.950
So now even though it's waiting
on something asynchronous,

304
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.214
you still have to wait for that down
here because at the end of the day,

305
00:16:16.214 --> 00:16:19.620
it is asynchronous because it's
waiting on something asynchronous.

306
00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:24.273
So yeah, when you put async in front
of anything, it'll be asynchronous,

307
00:16:24.273 --> 00:16:27.576
or if you return a promise from anything,
that function is now asynchronous.

308
00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:32.360
There's just no way to avoid it other
than to await it or resolve it with .div.
