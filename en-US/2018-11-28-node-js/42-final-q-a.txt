[00:00:00]
>> Scott Moss: Yeah, that's it. I wanna thank you all for coming to my course, and if there's any other questions ask me now, yes?
>> Speaker 2: You recommend Node.js or Express for building CMS or ecommerce sites?
>> Scott Moss: All right, so you might not have heard of this product, but if you go to Type IO it's literally a CMS that's built with Node, but it's kind of more than a CMS.

[00:00:27]
But yeah, actually I do recommend doing that. I think the thing about a CMS is that the difficult part is not The difficult part about CMS is the database, it's the data model, right? It's how do you model, especially if you're CMS is dynamic. If you allow people to make custom types, right, if you allow them to do something like that, then it gets really crazy.

[00:00:45]
So I think the CMS challenge is a database choice, but Node I think is the best choice for CMS because at the end of the day, your CMS has a front end component, right? You don't have a CMS for mobile. Almost nobody has that it's mostly on the web.

[00:00:57]
So the web is built with JavaScript if your server was also built in JavaScript, you can do more interesting things like server-side universal rendering you do a lot more crazier optimizations. You can do AB testing you can do all the stuff you would have liked to done in like PHP and WordPress, but now you can also do it in JavaScript.

[00:01:13]
So for that I do recommend using something like note on the server. For your CMS because you kinda get that same feel where you were doing all this embedded stuff in PHP, you can do that JavaScript now with a universal framework but it's JavaScript. So I highly recommend doing that because it's really good at that, but still put your assets on the CDN somewhere.

[00:01:33]
Don't be serving assets from a note server, just cache them somewhere. But yeah type is a CMS. You should check it out. Don't build one. Just use this one.
>> [LAUGH]
>> Speaker 3: If you don't need the GUI like Gatsby is getting a lot of popularity when it comes to.

[00:01:48]

>> Scott Moss: Yeah Gatsby is really amazing. One of the best out there. Kyle and the guys behind that team is just like pretty legit. They have like a static site generator that's like powered by Graph QL. We're doing a lot of integrations with them, and they're kinda changing the game of how things work.

[00:02:03]
And there's tons of other ones out there. One that we like to use is called Nuxt. Nuxt is and look, there's our logo. Nuxt is a framework built around Vue. It's one of the best frameworks I've ever used. So it's Vue, but a framework on top of that framework.

[00:02:18]
It's service side rendering, universal, static side, single bridge application, you name it, they got it. They even handle animations and transitions. Pretty much everything you can think of they handle it. And they're really good it's one of the best framers I've used. So we use them, they're pretty legit.

[00:02:33]
And yeah, there's just a lot of them. Gatsby's good, Nuxt is good. If you like React you might want to check out Next.js. I don't know if people still use this or not. I just don't keep up with React like I used to. But Next is pretty good.

[00:02:52]
There's a lot of optimism. Yeah, Next.js 7 is out so it looks like they're still working on it. The team behind Next is a really strong team. A really strong developer so-
>> Speaker 3: What I understood like Nuxt and Next are very similar but are more for like dynamic applications versus something view press or Gatsby just like static generators not dynamic server.

[00:03:15]

>> Scott Moss: Yeah, so Next I'm. I don't know the state of Next, but Next came out first. And then Nuxt copied Next and made Nuxt. They just replaced the E with U. But I don't know what Next can, but with Nuxt, you can generate static if you want to.

[00:03:29]
You can just say, just make a static site and I'm done it doesn't have to be dynamic. So they have those options. And that's why I like it, is you can like if you've ever built a app that had to work in different modes like universal, single page, static, it's a pain to get all those modes to work.

[00:03:45]
Whereas you can just do it with a flag with a CLI like universal or just deploy static or actually this is a single page application or this is just pure server. All the different four different types of modes they'll allow you to do it with one flag. And that's why I like using them.

[00:03:59]
Gatsby is strictly just for static sites, which are becoming more dynamic every single day, because everything's on a cloud now, cloud made up websites. But yeah, all those are really good options, so really cool stuff. Cool, all right, everyone, I appreciate you coming out to the course, and I hope you learn how to do some Node things.

[00:04:18]
And hit me up on Twitter, whatever email me if you got some stuff you want me to contribute to or some stuff to check out or if there's some cool stuff you want to show me like let me know. I'm down to like check out cool stuff and and promote all types of things.

[00:04:31]
So yeah, let me know.
>> Speaker 3: Last thing I'll mention is check out Scott's next course.
>> Scott Moss: Yes.
>> Speaker 3: Which is the API design.
>> Scott Moss: Yes, yes. So if you want to go to the next level check out the next course which is API design where we take express, we go a little deeper with rest.

[00:04:48]
We also do some graph ql things there. If you have never used graph ql it's pretty interesting, but we go a lot more into detail about that React connecting with mongo and doing database things. Sorta taken just a little step further of how to build an API, and that course is already out.

[00:05:01]
So feel free to check that out and most of patterns that I use in that course is actually what we use every day in my company that I built myself. So those are real world patterns and not so much super intro to very specific, very practical things. So if you want to get down to nitty-gritty to building applications, yeah, check that one out.
