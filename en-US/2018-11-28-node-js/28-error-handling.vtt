00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now we're going to talk
about error handling a little bit.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.140
So we talked about handling those errors.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.820
But now we're gonna talk about why
you need to handle those errors.

4
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.120
Any thrown or unhandled error will
cause the process to crash and exit.

5
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.760
That's fine in a browser, maybe.

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.060
But on the server, if you have one
server serving a million requests, and

7
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.480
one error crashed the entire server.

8
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.810
Nobody can use your product.

9
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.110
So it's not really a good thing.

10
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.410
So you need to handle those errors and

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.560
especially think about the unhandled
ones and stuff like that.

12
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.580
Your app may have errors that
should not cause a crash.

13
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.210
So you must handle them accordingly.

14
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.710
Like if I have an API and a user is
trying to authenticate but that user,

15
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.480
they sent up invalid authentication token,
and that causes an error on my server.

16
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.030
That shouldn't crash my server
because a user sent me an invalid

17
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.750
authentication token.

18
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.350
I should just send back a proper response.

19
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.050
I should handle that and send it back.

20
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.410
Just because there was an error,
that doesn't mean my app should crash.

21
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.500
I should accordingly figure out this
should definitely cause a crash,

22
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.030
or, this was a user error.

23
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.980
Just let them know about it,
and things like that.

24
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.320
So every error shouldn't
cause your app to crash.

25
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.260
Some you just don't care about,
some you do.

26
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.680
So you gotta figure out
accordingly how that works.
