00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Cuz NVM is open source,

2
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.180
it's not created by some foundation or
some paid company.

3
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.820
It's just some person made this, or
a group of people made this and was like,

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.350
here, I'm sick of this.

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.150
So it's open source,

6
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.350
so hopefully depending on them to
make a good readme, which they did.

7
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.870
So for NVM, they have a pretty
simple way to install it.

8
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.640
It wasn't this simple when I did it,
but if you have curl, right?

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.030
You can just use curl, and you can
just run this script right here, and

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.410
it'll pretty much install everything for
you.

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.730
Or if you have wget, you could use this,
and that's basically it.

12
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.530
So what it should do is it should add
these environment variables to your Bash.

13
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.200
So export them, it should do all this for
you by default.

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.390
But it's just showing you here
just in case it doesn't happen.

15
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.010
And that's about it.

16
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.090
You really shouldn't
have to do anything else.

17
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.850
You should just run this script and
it should just work.

18
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
If anything, you might have to source,
update your bash profile or

19
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.620
just open up a new terminal
window to get it to activate.

20
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.890
And that's about it.

21
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.670
And once you install NVM, now you have
to install the latest version of node.

22
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.650
And to that that, all you have to
do is just run NVM install node.

23
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.150
Just like that.

24
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560
I have all these instructions
in the readme, too.

25
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.800
I kind of go over how to install this
stuff but again if you're using NVM.

26
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.720
Once you install NVM,
just NVM install node.

27
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.700
Node is an alias for the latest version,
which will be 10 11.

28
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.430
So that will download it and

29
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.800
then what you should do now,
is now you got to switch to it.

30
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.560
Now you gotta tell your computer
in NVM that you want to use

31
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.190
the version you just downloaded.

32
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.576
And it gets kind of annoying if
you have to keep doing that,

33
00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:45.261
so instead of us using NVM use node,

34
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:50.474
what you can do is you can use
the default command, which is default.

35
00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.707
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Where is that?

36
00:01:55.707 --> 00:01:56.240
Here we go.

37
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.200
So you can just say NVM alias default.

38
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.470
And then the name of the version
that you downloaded, but

39
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.210
if you used the node name,
then it says node.

40
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.480
If you used the version name like ten,
then you will put ten here.

41
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.350
But I recommend just using
node cuz it's the latest.

42
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.140
So all you have to do is just
have an NVM alias default node.

43
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.242
And then now,

44
00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:19.210
any environment that you wrote will
always be the default version ten.

45
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.160
So you know, keep typing it NVM use ten,

46
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.980
NVM use ten every time
you open the window.

47
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.600
So I said,
there's a couple more steps here, but

48
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.380
there's really only like three commands.

49
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.940
You install NVM, you install node,
and then you set it to your default.

50
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.250
Just those three commands, they're in the
readme, and that's all you have to do and

51
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.630
then you are good and then you should
be able to verify your instructions.

52
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.850
Use the Red Bull use the CLI executable.
