00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:05.947
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is a topic I
really wanted to teach because,

2
00:00:05.947 --> 00:00:08.324
like I was telling someone earlier,

3
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.870
I just can't imagine a time where
I've written code without Nodejs.

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.602
I can't even go back in my
head like when did I learn it?

5
00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:17.770
I feel like I've always known it.

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.330
So I just want everybody else to
know it because it's life changing.

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.961
It's pretty amazing.
Especially if you already know JavaScript.

8
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:26.427
So I normally don't do slides.

9
00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:29.567
If you have ever watched any of my
courses, i'm just not the slide person.

10
00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:32.030
The military just kind of killed
me when it came to slides.

11
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.693
So I just don't do slides.

12
00:00:33.693 --> 00:00:38.069
But I'm doing slides for this one, because
there are a lot of concepts that I wanna

13
00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:42.574
go over and have conversations with you
all about, that aren't related to examples

14
00:00:42.574 --> 00:00:45.637
in code, but
just more thought exercises and concepts.

15
00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:49.821
So there will be slides with this, but
also there will be accompanying repo where

16
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.360
you will be doing a lot
of different exercises.

17
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.280
So in the repo you see read me and
all different types of things.

18
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.050
Feel free to poke around and look at it as
we go, but we're gonna explore all this,

19
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:58.900
so no need.

20
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.373
No requirements, or anything like that.

21
00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:03.110
We're gonna go over everything.

22
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.024
But again, the read me is there for any
resources or things that I talk about and

23
00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:10.188
you wanna see where that link is,
it's gonna be in the read me.

24
00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:12.570
And then, also the link to
the slide is in the reading.

25
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.060
So if you go down to resources and

26
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.460
click on that,
you'll see a link right here to the slide.

27
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.130
So you can go ahead and click on that and
follow along, if you want on the slide or

28
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.250
you can just watch my screen,
it's up to you.

29
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.135
But the slides will be there.

30
00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:29.520
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
start with this, with the slides and

31
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.110
then we'll jump back to a,
to the actual project in a minute, cool.

32
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.260
All right, so show of hands,
who's used Java script before?

33
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.240
Okay, everybody, yeah.

34
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.020
Cuz that's kind of a requirement for
this course.

35
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.626
So like if you didn't know Java script
it's gonna be a hard hard time, so

36
00:01:48.626 --> 00:01:51.735
that's good, that's good, okay, awesome.

37
00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:56.201
I heard a lot of people built like
projects with React or Ember.

38
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:58.438
So that means you have a little
bit of experience with Node,

39
00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:00.430
unless you're doing like
everything client side.

40
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.960
So I would imagine it's probably

41
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.910
gonna be some specific questions you
might have in your experience with Node.

42
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.920
So feel free to ask me those questions.

43
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.930
I really wanna help people out with
any practical situations that they

44
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.670
have at work.

45
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.200
That's just how my mind works.

46
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.430
I'm very practical.

47
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.439
So if there's something very specific
that you've encountered and you're like,

48
00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:20.423
well, explain this, ask me right away.

49
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:24.375
And that brings me to my next point,
so yeah, let's have fun with this.

50
00:02:24.375 --> 00:02:27.722
So yeah, like Mark said,
this is gonna be an intro to Nodejs.

51
00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:31.187
We're gonna go over everything
from installing to deploying

52
00:02:31.187 --> 00:02:34.530
many different types of apps,
and everything in between.
