&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, this is great.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.331
And what I wanna have you do,

3
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:07.607
is we're gonna define our own name
to types just using comments.

4
00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:12.187
The way you do that is with this typedef,
comment type.

5
00:00:12.187 --> 00:00:15.588
So, what we're effectively
saying here is we have a type,

6
00:00:15.588 --> 00:00:18.640
we're going to refer to
it as InventoryItem.

7
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.970
Now, whenever we're using that
@type thing in a comment,

8
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.397
we can say well this is an InventoryItem.

9
00:00:24.397 --> 00:00:29.510
And we're basically saying I'm going
to refer to a structure by name.

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.817
And with this typedef, this is where we
define what that structure looks like.

11
00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:37.507
And you can see here it's just an object
that has a property called, name,

12
00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:43.160
whose type is a string and a property
called price, whose type is a number.

13
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.864
We can combine that with another type and
we can call this an invoice item.

14
00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:50.488
And you see here,
rather than just saying object,

15
00:00:50.488 --> 00:00:55.650
we're actually in lining another type,
it's a different way.

16
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.506
So, this object here,
that's just another type definition.

17
00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:02.674
Sorry, this is just
another type definition.

18
00:01:02.674 --> 00:01:07.048
We could put whatever we want there,
including something that looks like this,

19
00:01:07.048 --> 00:01:12.010
which is not just an object, but it's
an object that it's of a particular shape.

20
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.750
And so we're saying okay,
we've got an InvoiceItem which says okay,

21
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.357
item whose value is an InventoryItem,

22
00:01:19.357 --> 00:01:24.027
that's the thing you took off the shelf
and here's how many you took.

23
00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:26.075
And then down here we could define,

24
00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:30.300
we could say okay well invoice
simply an array of invoice items.

25
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.917
And we could push an item into that and
it would be happy.

26
00:01:34.917 --> 00:01:39.528
And of course we try to push something
into it with a different shape,

27
00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:41.604
this is square peg round hole.

28
00:01:41.604 --> 00:01:42.780
It won't work.
