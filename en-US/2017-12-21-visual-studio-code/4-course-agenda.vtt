00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:01.812
&gt;&gt; Mike North: They way this
course is going to flow,

2
00:00:01.812 --> 00:00:05.338
we're first going to deal with becoming
expert users of Visual Studio Code.

3
00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:08.050
And then we're gonna get into
how we can fine tune it.

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.970
Customize the way it operates.

5
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.740
One of the things that
is a little challenging,

6
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.880
whenever I'm learning about a new editor
like this, is all of the key bindings and

7
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.704
all of little tips and tricks.

8
00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:23.214
I'm going to try to sprinkle those on
this course like seasoning, right?

9
00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:27.010
So we'll learn those as
we go add a new one or

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.310
two with every exercise that we tackle,
so that I'm not just dumping

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:38.670
a big list of key strokes on you like
at ones, which is always difficult.

12
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.224
The first one I'm gonna show you here,
this is cmd + D.

13
00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:45.630
And I told you you can bring
your key bindings with you.

14
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.380
So I'm showing you these
sublime oriented key binding.

15
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.870
You can find this one.

16
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.790
It's gonna be add next occurrence
under the selection menu.

17
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.410
So, if you've got a different
key map installed,

18
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.480
let me change my resolution
here just to make it bigger.

19
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.820
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Cuz the menus
are a little harder to see.

20
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:17.870
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm just gonna go
down to 720, that should be better.

21
00:01:20.406 --> 00:01:23.070
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So if we say Selection,
Add Next Occurrence.

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.150
So I've got cmd+D there.

23
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.390
What this one does.

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.970
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let me go to the README
we've been looking at here.

25
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.548
So, if I select,
put my cursor inside a inside a word and

26
00:01:37.548 --> 00:01:42.084
I hit cmd+D,it will select the whole word.

27
00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:43.893
And if I keep hitting cmd+D over and

28
00:01:43.893 --> 00:01:46.931
over again,
it'll actually select the next occurrence.

29
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:51.357
And you will notice we have
multiple occurences here.

30
00:01:51.357 --> 00:01:54.698
So I can like add new
characters along the way.

31
00:01:54.698 --> 00:02:01.310
This is one that I recommend you,
like focus on and try to love.

32
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.370
Try to incorporate into development,

33
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.770
because it lets you let's see if I can,
if it's case insensitive.

34
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.700
It is case insensitive.

35
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.670
So, if you're trying to like
rename a variable or something.

36
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.880
This is one way to do it.

37
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.010
We'll look at better ways for
that specific case.

38
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.850
But if you can now,
maybe you're dealing with like an open and

39
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.480
close tag of a particular
type of dom element or

40
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.330
a particular React component,
like this is an easy way to go about this.

41
00:02:28.893 --> 00:02:30.922
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
we will learn those as we go, so

42
00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:35.955
that hopefully they sink in a little bit
better rather than one consolidated dom.

43
00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.673
We'll be working with both JavaScript and

44
00:02:38.673 --> 00:02:42.229
TypeScript today,
you do not need to know TypeScript.

45
00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.704
We will talk about types, and

46
00:02:44.704 --> 00:02:50.360
like what is going on in terms of
how TypeScript understands types.

47
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.210
But this is not a requirement.

48
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.970
It's not required that you know this.

49
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.580
If you can work with JavaScript,
you should be fine here.

50
00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:02.010
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So with that,
let's jump into using Visual Studio code.

51
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.429
You can actually click on these links.

52
00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:10.350
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And I'm gonna just click up
here which is, Open Preview to the Side.

53
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.540
And we're on our next document.

54
00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:19.077
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, this is the general
outline of all of the topics were

55
00:03:19.077 --> 00:03:19.960
gonna hit.

56
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.200
We'll first talk about
building great documents.

57
00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.100
Mark down and otherwise.

58
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.160
We'll then dive into something
called Emmet which is,

59
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.348
I've been using Emmet for about a decade.

60
00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:38.210
And it's one of these things that
if you spend just a little bit of

61
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:42.740
time learning it, even if you only
ever get into it at a simple level,

62
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.060
it can really speed up your workflow.

63
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.310
It can make mundane things easy and fast.

64
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.540
And it is like really impressive
to be able to move so

65
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.400
quickly to generate HTML with Emmet.

66
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.320
So we'll dive into what exactly
that is and how to use it.

67
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.119
We'll look at some simple and then
increasingly complex refactoring cases.

68
00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:12.638
We will talk about Type-Checking,
and how we can check our JavaScript,

69
00:04:12.638 --> 00:04:18.880
and add type information without making
the full transition to using TypeScript.

70
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.079
We'll just stick with regular JavaScript
and see how much Typescript can do for

71
00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:27.348
us, without us actually
adopting the language.

72
00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:28.539
And then finally,

73
00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.236
we will deal with all of the great
debugging functionality inside VS code.

74
00:04:33.236 --> 00:04:35.545
I think with the exception
of the documents,

75
00:04:35.545 --> 00:04:38.840
because I don't need us to write
a document as an exercise here.

76
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.710
These four are each gonna have
about like a 20 minute intro, and

77
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.440
then exercise, we're gonna do it together.
