00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.490
&gt;&gt; Mike: So we talked about multi cursor.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.505
Option and click is how we
got those little cursors and

3
00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.054
without the Cmd+D thing.

4
00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:11.050
It was just placing cursors, right?

5
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.764
If we alt click,
it's just those individual positions.

6
00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:16.400
There is something called box select.

7
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.831
The way I remember this is,
it's multi cursor with Shift.

8
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.863
Multi-Cursor with shift.

9
00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:23.975
And that let's us do something like this.

10
00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:28.681
Alt+Shift, oops.
&gt;&gt; Mike: Sorry

11
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:32.779
it is fooling me by
highlighting in kind items.

12
00:00:32.779 --> 00:00:38.910
Alt+Shift and then you can drag up and
over like this.

13
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.130
Really nice for Like if you wanted
to grab a bunch of HTML elements and

14
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.960
like embed them, or
you have a list of items.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.302
Say we had something like this.
&gt;&gt; Mike: Like one,

16
00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:58.430
two, three,
it looks I already did example last night.

17
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.110
So I could just drag
a line of cursors here.

18
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.622
Select them, one of the cool things
about multi-cursor support and

19
00:01:06.622 --> 00:01:09.280
this works as it does in other browsers.

20
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.430
It's almost like each cursor get to
do in a little slot and a clip board.

21
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.213
So while I would go back here and
type like li and

22
00:01:17.213 --> 00:01:22.356
everyone gets the same thing,
I can actually grab all of this,

23
00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:26.251
cut it move my cursor into the middle and
paste.

24
00:01:26.251 --> 00:01:29.838
It’s not going to be one, one, one.

25
00:01:29.838 --> 00:01:34.736
It kind of remembers that each cursor
gets to hold onto it’s own value, and

26
00:01:34.736 --> 00:01:37.010
then when you paste it out it goes.

27
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.610
The values are preserved
on a per cursor basis.

28
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030
So, command U.

29
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.760
And I will update this that

30
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.000
option click also remove a cursor
if you click on that exact cursor.

31
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.840
And it appears to also work with

32
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.100
like if we have that multi
selection going on here.

33
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.500
And I alt click on this, it'll actually
get rid of the selection as well

34
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.620
not just the cursor which is exactly
what we would want in this case.

35
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.180
So you could select everything,
like we could do this what was it,

36
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.140
I haven't internalized this one yet.

37
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.940
Control command g, so I could say get
everything but remove just that one there.

38
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.349
It looks like it got everything.

39
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.611
Ctrl+Cmd+g.
&gt;&gt; Mike: Select everything and

40
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:33.140
then we on click.
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah, so

41
00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.383
now,
&gt;&gt; Mike: Well, sorry I messed it up there,

42
00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:41.137
but effectively we were
able to grab everything and

43
00:02:41.137 --> 00:02:43.880
then get rid of this one and
that one there.

44
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.730
And in this case that particular term
is probably used 30 times in this file.

45
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.450
It 'd be really nice to
bring it all at once.

46
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.120
All right, so line manipulation and
this is a subset but

47
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.900
I feel like it's the attainable subset for
line manipulation.

48
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.740
There are hot keys for everything.

49
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.320
Most of it is not stuff
that I would end up using.

50
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.740
Like there are people who you could
steal their mouse for a day and

51
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.160
they wouldn't even notice,
I am not one of those people.

52
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.230
So here is how I like to remember it, if
I hold down option, I can use the up and

53
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.839
down arrows to move this line
wherever I wanna move it.

54
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.890
Right I'm moving this around.

55
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.210
If I add shift to that and
hit down I'm copying this line.

56
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:43.380
So I would say the moving around thing
I have internalized and I'm trying to

57
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.520
remember that adding shift gives,
it is stamping that all over the place.
