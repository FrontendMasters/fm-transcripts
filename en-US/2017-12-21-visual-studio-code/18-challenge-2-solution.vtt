00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.250
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So welcome back.

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.270
We are going to go through
two refactoring exercises.

3
00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.934
First what we’re gonna do is,
we're going to rename two functions.

4
00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:11.970
We’re gonna do it in such a way where
we are kind of focused on one file.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.210
And we can change the name of a symbol.

6
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.030
In this case, the name of a function and
this will work across our whole project.

7
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.660
This will work in most cases.

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.590
We've seen at least one where
it didn't quite catch something.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.460
Where we were having functions that were

10
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.310
bound to dom events through the render
function of a react component.

11
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.480
But for your vanilla JavaScript stuff,
this should work pretty nicely.

12
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.038
The second thing we're gonna do is,

13
00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:45.364
we're basically gonna change
the structure of an argument.

14
00:00:45.364 --> 00:00:48.180
We're gonna change
a convention that sort of

15
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.870
deals with how two pieces
of our code communicate.

16
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.960
Normally, you'd have to do a lot of
searching by string to find like,

17
00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.040
who is invoking this function and
what are they passing along?

18
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.100
And is this the same fire function
that we were talking earlier or

19
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.720
is this something different?

20
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.650
So we're gonna see if we can
showcase two refactoring tasks and

21
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.170
see what VS Code does for us.

22
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.040
Let's go to this listener-support file.

23
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.820
The first thing we want to do
is register and un-register.

24
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.896
We want to rename this.

25
00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:24.910
I am gonna open up my sidebar here,
and go back to this explorer view.

26
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.820
So here, just so we can see

27
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.588
any files that may pop-up here,
as a result of what we are doing.

28
00:01:33.588 --> 00:01:37.430
I am gonna select register and
I am just gonna hit F2.

29
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.437
And what this is doing is gonna let
me rename this function across all

30
00:01:41.437 --> 00:01:45.571
files.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You can see

31
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:49.290
over here on the left,
these three things popped up.

32
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.000
They're basically unsaved
files with modifications.

33
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.070
It's my job to go through and
make sure that they look reasonable.

34
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.460
Before I do I'm gonna hit F2 here.

35
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.311
And I'm gonna say unregister(listener),
so we can get both at once.

36
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:07.039
So this file looks good, I made these
changes explicitly, let's look over here.

37
00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.353
We will use as a guide.

38
00:02:09.353 --> 00:02:16.390
The little like coloration of
the scroll bar I would say, right.

39
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.550
So we've got these two little blue chunks.

40
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.020
Those represent modifications.

41
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.210
You can see here is our register and
unregister.

42
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.630
I just dove into the definition there.

43
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.170
In this case, for

44
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.290
react people you will note that I
am not unregistering these ever.

45
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.330
It's because this component
is never torn down.

46
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.320
So typically you would want that symmetry.

47
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.860
This one's always on the screen.

48
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.060
So those look good.

49
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.180
I'll save this file, and I'm just going
through this kind of like to do list.

50
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.990
Saving the file when I'm happy
with the way that this works.

51
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.870
Okay, so here's my register listener.

52
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.520
That looks good.

53
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.630
I should probably be tearing
that down as well, but no worry.

54
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.360
We don't really have multiple
routes in this app, so

55
00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.680
this is always on the screen too.

56
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.710
Okay, and the last one here,
we've got a category row.

57
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.663
Here, these do come on and
off the screen potentially, and so

58
00:03:07.663 --> 00:03:12.385
we've got our register and our unregister
and those both look good to me.

59
00:03:12.385 --> 00:03:16.620
So we can save those, and over here I'm
actually gonna close these tabs like this.

60
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.930
Close, close, close, all right.

61
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.784
So that's task number one.

62
00:03:22.784 --> 00:03:23.740
We're done with that.

63
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.260
Task number two involves basically finding
everyone who's using a function and

64
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.990
making a little change to it,
so that we're

65
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.310
altering the form of argument
that is passed to a function.

66
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.100
So all parties who are calling this
function must be touched up a little bit.

67
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.900
So we'll dive back into this file,
listener support, and

68
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.330
we can get rid of this for now.

69
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.800
And let's like at fire, and
we're gonna right click on this.

70
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.370
And I'm gonna find all references, and

71
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.540
we're basically gonna use our ability
to change code right within the peak

72
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.710
editor here,
to make all of our necessary changes.

73
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.830
Now you can see one of these is sort of
the definition of the function itself.

74
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.290
So that counts as a reference,
it is where it's defined.

75
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.410
But these other three,
we will need change a little bit.

76
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.560
And all we're gonna do is wrap this,
in an object.

77
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.630
Like that, we can save it.

78
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.819
And we'll go over here,

79
00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:33.458
in the grocery item store.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Save

80
00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:38.547
it.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Just change all of these,

81
00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:42.430
it's really easy,
cuz it is basically our to-do list.

82
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.225
And then the last one.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

83
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:52.656
and now the last thing we have to do is,
we said we shouldn't really alter what is

84
00:04:52.656 --> 00:04:56.711
parsed to each of these listeners we
just have to do something like that.

85
00:04:56.711 --> 00:04:59.946
Payload.data, so
that the call backs that we register,

86
00:04:59.946 --> 00:05:04.510
those are all getting exactly the same
thing that they have been getting.

87
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.320
We've sort of through
making this set of changes,

88
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.680
which was,
I mean let's admit it relatively painless.

89
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.180
We have altered the form of an argument
while leaving as much of our other code as

90
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.670
possible relatively intact.

91
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.900
So this would be a great thing where like,

92
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.600
this would be a small
commit that you could make.

93
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.950
That is one complete change in isolation.

94
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.940
Save that.

95
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.690
Let's refresh.

96
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.305
Our app should still work
if it's in the foreground.

97
00:05:34.928 --> 00:05:36.104
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Maybe I forgot something,

98
00:05:36.104 --> 00:05:36.670
let's see.

99
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.850
Do we have a JavaScript error?

100
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:46.945
Do, do, do, cannot read map of undefined.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting.

101
00:05:51.807 --> 00:05:54.075
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Categories,

102
00:05:54.075 --> 00:05:58.590
it's like something didn't take.

103
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.520
Maybe I have an unsaved file, I do.

104
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.812
Here it is.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

105
00:06:03.812 --> 00:06:06.390
here this wasn't saved for some reason.

106
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.300
Let's bring back my sidebar,
I do need to save all this, sorry.

107
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.560
And now it should work.

108
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.060
And it does.

109
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.790
So really, really nice.

110
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.610
This peak editor lets you kind
of work within this file,

111
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.780
the listener support file,
focus on that one function, and

112
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.480
then open up in a little sub window like
all of the things that are using this and

113
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.390
go through one by one and
make those alterations.

114
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.180
Much, much easier than like,
opening up seven different tabs and

115
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.964
making sure that that's
the correct function.

116
00:06:38.964 --> 00:06:40.530
And is this the right module?

117
00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.240
Like all of that work is done for you.

118
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.178
All of that work is why they're
showing up as references and

119
00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:52.630
not just sort of this less Robust,
like search panel on the left.

120
00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.680
Where we're just searching simply for
string match.

121
00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.130
This is not a string match.

122
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.970
This takes the structure
of your code into account.

123
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.370
The modules into account.

124
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.360
The types into account.
