00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You can also
use Emmet in style sheets.

2
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.300
So I'll show you what that looks like.

3
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.814
All right, so
let's say we've got some style body, and

4
00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:12.390
we can basically create
an abbreviation that

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.342
looks like this.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Tab and

6
00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:22.891
it will be padding of ten pixels.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

7
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.317
I cannot remember anywhere near
all of the different style

8
00:00:27.317 --> 00:00:31.120
properties here in order
to make this work for me.

9
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:39.060
So I rely on IntelliSense, which are these
little autocompletes that it's showing us.

10
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.440
And you can see here, we're being told.

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.530
Okay, P10, this is what code is
understanding at this moment, right,

12
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.490
its understanding its padding and
its ten pixels and we should expand it.

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.204
We can add a P and
we can see we've gotten 2% at that point.

14
00:00:56.204 --> 00:00:57.660
Lets see if we can do this one.

15
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.550
So that's color black.

16
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.840
And you can hit tab and expand that out.

17
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.593
So it works for CSS2.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So the too

18
00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:19.250
many style combinations to remember,
remember this is for repetitive stuff.

19
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.390
And like it, this is not a mountain
that you should try to climb and

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.170
try to just memorize everything.

21
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.450
If it's repetitive enough,
you will know it.

22
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.980
For me margin and padding,
that's a good place to start.

23
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.193
M10, P10 something like that.

24
00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:39.900
You can even do something like P10!,
don't use important now.

25
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.240
Watch the SAS course for
why you shouldn't use important.

26
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.260
But, you probably do want to remember
these, they're called value aliases.

27
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.200
And it's just an abbreviation for,
think of it like your units almost.

28
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.490
So we've got rem, this is not
really an abbreviation, but px.

29
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.850
Certain things like margin and

30
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.250
padding they will assume
pixels unless told otherwise.

31
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.254
They're other value aliases,
but these are,

32
00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:13.270
this is a good place to start.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

33
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.940
from multi word properties just
try the first letter of each word.

34
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.170
Like line height LH that's
probably line height.

35
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.132
But IntelliSense is gonna
tell you the right thing.

36
00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:28.697
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There you go,

37
00:02:28.697 --> 00:02:33.135
it should probably be like that,

38
00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:36.470
or something like that.

39
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.100
So it's designed to be intuitive.

40
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.365
Here's some examples,
like I would definitely remember this one.

41
00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:49.028
I would probably use this all
the time without the important.

42
00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:52.808
This,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Depends how many cups of

43
00:02:52.808 --> 00:02:56.000
coffee I've had whether I remember this or
not.

44
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.220
This I would definitely remember.

45
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.710
I had to do capacity all the time for
animations and things like that.

46
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.600
So again,
just pick up what you can pick up.

47
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.150
And I probably retain
10% of this stuff but

48
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.320
I still get a ton of mileage out of it.

49
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.997
Even after l n years I still
retain only the stuff that I need,

50
00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:21.948
rIght?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

51
00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:26.590
so as you start to use Emmet,
first be aware that any new line or

52
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.606
space that is regarded as sort of
a stop in these Emmet expansions.

53
00:03:31.606 --> 00:03:36.940
So if I were to do something like this,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: that's not going to expand.

54
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.300
It needs to basically be spaceless and
new lines are not allowed either.

55
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.536
We will end up creating a custom shortcut.

56
00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:51.508
We're gonna make it placeholder image that
will just be PH, so you can do PH tab.

57
00:03:51.508 --> 00:03:54.078
And then you'll basically just
need to say with the height

58
00:03:54.078 --> 00:03:57.500
of the placeholder in which those
are the two blanks that will fill in.

59
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.480
But it will build this whole image tag
with the URL set properly all done for us.

60
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.442
Big one here, just go for
the small expansions.

61
00:04:08.442 --> 00:04:11.830
I probably only go two layers deep.

62
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.980
If I'm going three layers deep,
I'm exceptionally perky that day,

63
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.850
but two is probably what to shoot for.

64
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.230
Even if you're just doing a div
that has multiple classes on it,

65
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.840
it's really nice to just be able
to do .class, .class, .class tab.

66
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.020
So start there, don't

67
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.448
fall into the trap of trying to
make a perfect one shot thing.

68
00:04:37.448 --> 00:04:41.080
It's satisfying but there it's not
saving you time, it's costing you time.

69
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.370
And again just like the key bindings,

70
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.120
start with the few and
prepare in more as you go.

71
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.870
Add more as you go.
