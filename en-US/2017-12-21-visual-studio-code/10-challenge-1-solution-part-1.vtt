00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.330
&gt;&gt; Mike: We're going to go through
the solution for this exercise.

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.590
So what we want to do is go to this file.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.740
And basically, we want to create
a down structure that looks like this.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.582
So we've got an li and
then an h4 that is a descendant of that.

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.346
And then as a sibling to that,
we've got a span and image tag,

6
00:00:24.346 --> 00:00:33.036
so let's open up the file in question
&gt;&gt; Mike: All right,

7
00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:35.511
so, I'm just gonna move
this off to the side so

8
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.310
that we can see the structure
that we're going for.

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.802
By the way, if you didn't catch that, you
can just drag tabs off to the right side.

10
00:00:48.727 --> 00:00:51.076
&gt;&gt; Mike: So we want an li on the outside.

11
00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:58.803
It's gonna be li.GroceryItem.mui-panel.

12
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:03.844
&gt;&gt; Mike: And then inside of that,

13
00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:08.339
we're gonna have,
expanding this out a little bit.

14
00:01:08.339 --> 00:01:12.062
So h4 and then a span, so
we'll just say there's our h4 and

15
00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:16.004
then we'll have parentheses,
and actually we don't need it,

16
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:19.670
because we're gonna go
as a descendant into it.

17
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.800
So, the span has a click for
more class on it.

18
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.795
And the image has an item image class.

19
00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:34.580
Span.click-for-more&gt;img.item-image.

20
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.320
So if I tab now, we've basically
created the appropriate structure.

21
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.430
Now that was like, so let me prove
that it is the appropriate structure.

22
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.803
We're gonna hit Save, and

23
00:01:46.803 --> 00:01:54.031
let's look at the app.
&gt;&gt; Mike: Looks like I'm not running.

24
00:02:03.486 --> 00:02:05.113
&gt;&gt; Mike: Scroll all the way to the right,

25
00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:06.784
we get something here, right?

26
00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:11.721
We're not seeing anything yet, let me
make sure that everything looks proper.

27
00:02:11.721 --> 00:02:18.690
We don't have anything in this h4.
&gt;&gt; Mike: Something like that.

28
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.270
And if we look back and refresh,
there we've got our click for more.

29
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.190
So now we just have to create
our image attribute there.

30
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.450
And so the general form, we're looking for

31
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.260
is something like this, right?

32
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.360
So this will actually work, so
that's like frozen food, right?

33
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.390
So I'll copy that, go over here,
paste that in, oop.

34
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.844
I had something else on my clipboard,

35
00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:54.156
apparently.
&gt;&gt; Mike: We don't need to look at these

36
00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:55.113
side by side anymore.

37
00:02:55.113 --> 00:02:56.528
We'll get back into this mode here.

38
00:02:56.528 --> 00:03:02.100
Copy and paste.

39
00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.690
We're serving these images on same origin.

40
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:12.222
So we can use an absolute path,
and same origin is implied.

41
00:03:12.222 --> 00:03:16.148
The point I was trying to make
about interpolating dynamic and

42
00:03:16.148 --> 00:03:20.679
static content, in react, we cannot
simply do something like this and

43
00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.940
start putting our JavaScript in there.

44
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.350
Basically, value of this attribute
it is either static or it's dynamic.

45
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.350
So, as soon as we find
ourselves wanting to mix,

46
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.840
wanting to put something in there that's
dynamic, we have to shift into a world

47
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.670
where we're basically building a
JavaScript expression inside these braces.

48
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.940
And if we convert this
quotes to back text,

49
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.540
we're basically using these template
literals as a JavaScript language feature.

50
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.040
And inside here,
we can put whatever it is of interest.

51
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.360
So I'm just gonna copy this
because this is apparently how

52
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.830
the name of the category is rendered as
little title above the row of groceries.

53
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.246
We'll put that down here and
we need to do one last thing,

54
00:04:08.246 --> 00:04:15.419
two lower case.
&gt;&gt; Mike: And

55
00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.980
if we refresh, it should work.

56
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.850
Now depending on how your file
system is set up, you may or

57
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.760
may not actually need to
make it lower case or not.

58
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.730
So it is based on how
you've formatted your disk,

59
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.790
like sometimes capitalization just
doesn't matter for file names at all.

60
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.955
So maybe that you're able to get it
like no matter what, this will work for

61
00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:42.455
everyone, now that we've said two
lowercase, the file name is lower case, so

62
00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:45.980
even if you have a case sensitive disk,
should be good.

63
00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.658
And now we have these little tiles, right?

64
00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:56.640
I'm gonna say that was sort
of unrealistically complex,

65
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.920
I will show you how I would have
done this more realistically.

66
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.640
So you can see that what you're trying
to learn is not how to create this huge,

67
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.670
long expansion.

68
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.090
It is multiple little rapid expansions.

69
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.487
So I probably would've
done something like this.

70
00:05:11.487 --> 00:05:16.263
li.GroceryItem.mui-panel, tab,

71
00:05:16.263 --> 00:05:19.637
Enter, and then h4, tab.

72
00:05:19.637 --> 00:05:22.822
And then, Click for more and

73
00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:27.735
here I would say span.click-for-more,

74
00:05:27.735 --> 00:05:31.200
and then an image inside of it.

75
00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.500
And then here,
I would have started building my image.

76
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.560
But you see, because of the cursor
placement is so nice, right.

77
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.290
Because we can say,
if we go all the way back to this here.

78
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.407
When I hit tab like my cursor is in
just the right place to hit enter and

79
00:05:47.407 --> 00:05:49.752
to start working on my next expansion.

80
00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:55.514
This is easier for me to think about,
cuz almost no thought

81
00:05:55.514 --> 00:06:01.760
is required to kind of transform
this into what it expands to.

82
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.020
This, to me, is obvious,
because it is like a CSS selector for

83
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.880
this particular element.

84
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.240
So I would do it in a couple of steps,
more realistically.

85
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.293
But as you go through, just took like,

86
00:06:15.293 --> 00:06:19.105
start with just things that
completely align with CSS.

87
00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:23.402
And then after that,
start adding in this multiplication thing.

88
00:06:23.402 --> 00:06:25.913
You can even,
as you start to get more complicated,

89
00:06:25.913 --> 00:06:30.827
do things like this.
&gt;&gt; Mike: We didn't cover

90
00:06:30.827 --> 00:06:35.278
it but,
&gt;&gt; Mike: You can add attributes the same

91
00:06:35.278 --> 00:06:38.780
way you would add them in CSS
selectors and expand them out.

92
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.300
So to me, this is as easy to read and
as easy to remember as CSS.

93
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.370
So this is what sticks for me.

94
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.530
The rest of it,
I kinda just write by hand.

95
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.230
So even at a basic level,
you get a lot of mileage out of this.
