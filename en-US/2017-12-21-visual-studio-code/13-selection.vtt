00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.575
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
let's talk about selection a little bit.

2
00:00:02.575 --> 00:00:05.100
Cmd+A, select all for most things.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.010
This is true, if we were to
just go to a browser here and

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.072
hit Cmd+A,
we actually end up selecting everything.

5
00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:15.170
So this is not a code thing,
this is the way your OS works.

6
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.400
Select next occurence, so we've already
looked at that, for me, it's Cmd+D.

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.970
You can edit this file locally and
put your key binding here so

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.720
you remember it later.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.060
That'll be in this selection menu
right here, Select Next Occurrence.

10
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.840
Previous Occurence, I find that
like I can spot the first one and

11
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.030
then find it from there.

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.457
And keep in mind that when you
say select next occurrence,

13
00:00:43.457 --> 00:00:46.440
it'll actually wrap around to
the beginning of the file.

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.680
Eventually if you just
spam Cmd+D a few times,

15
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.908
you will catch everything
that has that name.

16
00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:58.160
Select all occurrences is pretty slick and
for me, that key binding, it's at the end,

17
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.018
it's Ctrl+Cmd+G.

18
00:01:00.018 --> 00:01:04.855
So let's see if this this actually works,
if I've got groceryItem here.

19
00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:10.470
Ctrl+Cmd+G, now I've got all
groceryItems in my whole file selected.

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.740
Not just that, but
I've got a cursor at the end of each, so

21
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.440
if there was a spelling error or
something, I'd be in a great position to

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.140
fix it and then save.

23
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.160
But I've got cursors all
over the place here.

24
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.383
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So this, when we start

25
00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:32.250
talking about key bindings, sometimes you
find that there's a really useful tool.

26
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.900
Like maybe you discover that, okay,
Cmd+D, finding the next occurrence.

27
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.950
That's great, but really, you just select
all is what you want most of the time.

28
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.290
You could always remap that, right?

29
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.450
And I'm gonna suggest you only pick four
or five of these things at least to start.

30
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.702
Where you say,
this looks really promising,

31
00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:56.100
but then do it gradually and
incrementally.

32
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.600
Developers like to jump in and
tweak everything, tune their editor, and

33
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.110
try to get used to everything at once.

34
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.971
And it is tough to retain all that, yes?
&gt;&gt; off screen: If you're using the at next

35
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:10.770
occurrence, and you go one too many,
say you had ten instances and

36
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.283
you only wanted to select seven or
eight of them,

37
00:02:14.283 --> 00:02:19.264
is there a way to undo?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yep, see, undo

38
00:02:19.264 --> 00:02:20.914
&gt;&gt; off screen: How, which-

39
00:02:20.914 --> 00:02:22.287
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That's Cmd+U.

40
00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:23.004
&gt;&gt; off screen: Cmd+U?

41
00:02:23.004 --> 00:02:24.126
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Cmd+U, and that,

42
00:02:24.126 --> 00:02:25.860
by the way, that is the same.

43
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.970
So anyone in here used
multi-cursor support at all,

44
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.340
just clicking in a couple of different
places, where you hold down Alt and click.

45
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.770
And has anyone ever, when you're trying
to edit six items, when you get to that

46
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.190
sixth item, you're like,
please let me land in the right spot here.

47
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.980
If you're one character off,
you've created more work for

48
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.350
yourself than you had a hope of saving.

49
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.000
But you can just hit Cmd+U and
it'll unwind those cursors.

50
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.920
So you could go click,
click, click, click and

51
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.590
then Cmd+U, think of it as
a little mini undo redo stack.

52
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.180
Right, undo redo does not apply to this,
but

53
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.870
it's got its own little mini
sequence of operations.

54
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.010
And it'll keep track of these things,
like these selections here, and

55
00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.505
you can just hit Cmd+U and back it off.
&gt;&gt; off screen: Well I think you can

56
00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:18.110
Alt-click on it, as well, can't you, if
you wanna pick ones out of the middle or

57
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.180
something?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's see,

58
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.750
can I Alt click on this and
remove it, I can.

59
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.400
But that's dangerous territory, man.
&gt;&gt; off screen: [LAUGH]

60
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.560
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And for selection, yeah,

61
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.250
I guess that could work.

62
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.930
Let's see if it works with this, though.
&gt;&gt; off screen: If you wanna just remove

63
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.730
one from the middle or something,
you don't wanna edit one in the middle,

64
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.980
you can just Alt-click that.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah, that's a good tip.

65
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.210
&gt;&gt; off screen: I did not know that,

66
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.490
that's awesome.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I like that, so

67
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.160
that's like a random access way
of getting rid of a cursor,

68
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.790
in addition to the undo redo stuff.

69
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.400
Cool stuff, I learned that just now,
thank you for

70
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.565
the tip.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

71
00:03:56.565 --> 00:03:58.145
fill in you key bindings as you go.

72
00:03:58.145 --> 00:03:59.755
This is really worth it,

73
00:03:59.755 --> 00:04:03.285
especially if you've got a variable that
you're using in multiple different places.

74
00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:05.925
And now you find that you've
collided with this other thing.

75
00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:10.455
Or in a code review, you bring your
friend over, you start pair programming.

76
00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:12.685
They say, I don't understand
the name of that variable.

77
00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:15.665
It's not descriptive enough,
time to go rename it.

78
00:04:15.665 --> 00:04:17.245
We'll look at a better way
to rename in a moment.
