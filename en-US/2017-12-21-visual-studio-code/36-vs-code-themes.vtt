00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.910
&gt;&gt; Mike North: When dealing with theming
you can have two kinds of themes

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:04.530
that work.

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.260
One is a color theme.

4
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.240
And I will show you what that looks like.

5
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.747
So I just did shift command P and
then if you just search for a theme,

6
00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.204
you will see you get to color theme and

7
00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:20.653
color icon theme
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And so,

8
00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:26.589
you can actually go up and down, and
it should update sort of in real

9
00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:33.036
time with whatever you are asking for.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You

10
00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:35.540
also get a file icon theme.

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.506
And let's
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's look at how

12
00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:41.780
that appears.

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.580
Notice I've got icons to the left here.

14
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.940
And just because I've named these files in
a particular way they get a special icon.

15
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.290
Like client has a tiny little laptop and
a mobile device..

16
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.330
Server has a big tower.

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.410
Box there.

18
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.302
Webpack has its own icon, and

19
00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:04.036
those are their own themes.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And you can pick what you

20
00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:08.010
want, so you see this is like the one
that ships the Visual Studio Code.

21
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.964
This is a ridiculously popular one,
VSCode Icons.

22
00:01:11.964 --> 00:01:16.142
It probably is by far the most
downloaded extension.

23
00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:23.590
It's got like 3 million Downloads total
which is huge for something like this.

24
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.738
So you get to pick what you want,
setti is something that's sort of is a,

25
00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:34.656
it was popular with,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think that

26
00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:39.326
comes from Adam but, you see,
we've got, like, some file icons here.

27
00:01:39.326 --> 00:01:43.184
The folders don't get icons,
it's a little bit more, sort of,

28
00:01:43.184 --> 00:01:47.510
minimal, if what I had going on there
was a little bit too busy for you.

29
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.540
So, I was going to go through, like,
the ability to define your own theme, so

30
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.940
that we could each build our
own little extension and

31
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.330
install that as our own color scheme.

32
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.010
The good news is you don't
have to do that anymore.

33
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.590
As of two weeks ago,
you can do this right in your settings,

34
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.130
you can pick a base theme
that you're interested in.

35
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.130
And you can do whatever you want in
terms of colors right there in your own

36
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.030
configuration, without having to worry
about making it a separate project that

37
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.170
you then push to the marketplace, and
then bring into your Visual Studio Code.

38
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.720
And it's like Much less
hassle to just do it.

39
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.020
And if you wanna share it,
just share your settings files or

40
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.790
share the subset that's just your colors.

41
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.690
Again, tons of options here for
customizing things.

42
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.500
So I'm not gonna tell you the entire list,
IntelliSense will help you out a lot.

43
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.684
Let me show you.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

44
00:02:41.684 --> 00:02:47.086
here I've got,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's

45
00:02:47.086 --> 00:02:52.430
do workbench.colorCustomizations, and
then in here I'm going to delete that.

46
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.700
That is extra.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We need a comma there.

47
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.480
So here you can see we've got a whole
array of options to pick from.

48
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.181
So we could do something really obvious,
editor.background, and

49
00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:13.179
we'll make it,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Bright

50
00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.181
red.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

51
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.750
it takes effect immediately.

52
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.770
And if I remove that and
save, It goes away.

53
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.220
Really easy to do,
one that I have all the time in place.

54
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.470
Actually, I don't do much
with color customizations.

55
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.470
I do something else, though.

56
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.620
And that is
a Syntax Highlighting Customization.

57
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.652
So what you're seeing here, this is a
representative example of different things

58
00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:41.594
you can do with syntax highlighting.

59
00:03:41.594 --> 00:03:44.910
And you see starting from the top
we've got comments and types.

60
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.270
So that would be any of the types
that we were working with before,

61
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.070
like constructors, you would see those
colored in a particular way with

62
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.250
that color, right, comments,
it would brighten up.

63
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.230
This is one that I have for real in my
user settings all the time, because most

64
00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.020
developers want the comments to sort
of be A secondary aspect of their code,

65
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.830
meaning it doesn't compete for
attention with the function itself.

66
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.140
Unless you're training people and
presenting on a projector all day,

67
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.600
at which point the comments
are probably very important.

68
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.740
So I will pick a theme and then make sure
the comments are appropriately emphasized.

69
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.160
So, these are examples of sort
of basic things you can do.

70
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.230
Here is an example of
using text mate rules.

71
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.940
So text mate is another editor that
defined a really comprehensive and

72
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.060
complete way of editing themes at a far
more granular level, where you can say.

73
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.140
Yeah, I want to apply
the following styles to just

74
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:53.340
variables when they are arguments
to functions or parameters.

75
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.691
And only then should
you make them bold and

76
00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:59.166
red.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

77
00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:03.230
you have far more knobs to turn once
you get into these text-made styles.

78
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.760
And then finally down here,
it's an example of,

79
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.340
maybe we don't wanna change the color of
something, but we can change its style and

80
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.680
we will see why that might
be interesting in a moment.
