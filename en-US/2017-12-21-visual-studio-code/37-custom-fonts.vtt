00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.895
&gt;&gt; Mark North: So
there are fonts built just for developers.

2
00:00:03.895 --> 00:00:08.760
Custom fonts that you can install
that are just intended for code.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.027
They're all monospaced.

4
00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:13.000
Meaning, each letter has
the exact same width.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.550
The one that I've been
using is called Fira code.

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.630
This is one of my favorites,
but these are all free.

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.901
So I will show you why you might want
to use something like Fira code.

8
00:00:27.947 --> 00:00:32.385
&gt;&gt; Mark North: So one of the benefits here
is something called ligatures which is

9
00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:34.885
think of how script font might look,

10
00:00:34.885 --> 00:00:39.484
a cursive font when you have two
letters that are next to each other,

11
00:00:39.484 --> 00:00:43.740
it will render them as kind of
a different combined glyph.

12
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.182
Basically, taking the end of
the stroke for the first letter and

13
00:00:47.182 --> 00:00:48.658
moving it into the second.

14
00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:53.535
So some of these fonts have taken
that ability to do that kind of thing

15
00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:57.490
with text and
they've done some interesting things.

16
00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.200
Like if I say, greater than or
equal to, I end up looking like that.

17
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.133
Or if I say, not equal, I look like that.

18
00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:10.850
And if I add another equal sign not
double equal, it looks like that.

19
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.450
Or my fat arrow functions,
kind of become nice like this.

20
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.030
When I'm writing a licks here, there's
something called a pipe forward operator.

21
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.650
Turns into a nice little triangle.

22
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.130
Asterisk usually is written above the
midline of a font, almost like a footnote.

23
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.977
But with this one,
it is written on the same line and

24
00:01:32.977 --> 00:01:36.382
all of the arithmetic
symbols like plus and minus.

25
00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:39.748
They're enlarged by about 50%, so

26
00:01:39.748 --> 00:01:44.520
you can easily read them as
you go through this stuff.

27
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.161
So it really does make
quite a big difference and

28
00:01:48.161 --> 00:01:51.354
just find what you like, and install it.

29
00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:55.330
You don't wanna install a whole bunch of
fonts, they take up system resources.

30
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.167
They basically have to live in your RAM,

31
00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:00.150
your whole table of fonts that you
have installed in your device.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.200
So it's not a good idea to just
like install a thousand of them.

33
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.860
But find a couple that you enjoy,

34
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.895
that are good representative
examples of this is what I like for

35
00:02:11.895 --> 00:02:16.553
code and I use these for
presentations and get them right.

36
00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:21.700
So this is how we would go about
adding one of these to our work space.

37
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.034
These are the things that you would
paste into your user settings.

38
00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:26.609
So you see I've got Fira code.

39
00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.420
I've enabled font ligatures, which is
the thing that will let me look at greater

40
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.049
than or equal to combined and
form one glif.

41
00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.430
Now if you selected that and
pasted it somewhere else,

42
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.150
it's actually two characters.

43
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.450
It just shows on the screen as one
thing and this basically, oop, sorry.

44
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.530
This thing here is the same flag, but
I'm also turning on ligatures for

45
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.100
the integrated terminal.

46
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.510
So if wanted to have a difference there,
there's the option to.

47
00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.960
One thing I wanna show you, so there's
some non-free fonts that you can get.

48
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.140
One of the popular ones, which I am
just demonstrating here for you.

49
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.800
It's called Operator Mono.

50
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.996
So if I save that, one of the cool things

51
00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:18.563
about Operator Mono is that if we do

52
00:03:18.563 --> 00:03:23.129
our color customizations here and

53
00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:29.751
we said like let's say
that keywords are italic.

54
00:03:37.523 --> 00:03:39.615
&gt;&gt; Mark North: And we need to
discuss some of that as keywords.

55
00:03:41.808 --> 00:03:42.338
&gt;&gt; Mark North: There we go.

56
00:03:42.338 --> 00:03:48.063
So that's actually cut little
cursive e letters for any keywords.

57
00:03:48.063 --> 00:03:50.780
Do we have an if somewhere?

58
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.182
&gt;&gt; Mark North: I guess there
are no ifs in this code.

59
00:03:55.182 --> 00:03:56.730
There we go, if and else.

60
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.962
So you can have some interesting
stuff going on here.

61
00:04:00.962 --> 00:04:02.988
And if you see this kind
of thing in screenshot,

62
00:04:02.988 --> 00:04:05.429
it's just cuz someone's got
one of these fancy phones.

63
00:04:13.783 --> 00:04:14.870
&gt;&gt; Mark North: Backing it up.

64
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.884
Save and we're back.
