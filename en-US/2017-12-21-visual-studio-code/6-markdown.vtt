00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The next thing
we're gonna talk about is

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.480
building great documents
in Visual Studio Code.

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.050
One of the great strengths of the way
markdown is handled in Visual Studio Code

4
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.060
is it matches really nicely with
the way GitHub handles markdown.

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.218
So what I'm gonna show you here,
this is sort of a cheat sheet for

6
00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:25.915
all of the different things you can do
in the body of a GitHub issue that you

7
00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:26.916
would create.

8
00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.583
Or pull request that you'd open or

9
00:00:28.583 --> 00:00:32.140
just markdown files that you
would check into your project.

10
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.740
So, the first thing I wanna show you or
just gonna go and

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.690
look at the same project on GitHub.

12
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.880
Oops, sorry it's over here.

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.090
So when we just look at
a folder like docs/here.

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.300
Here are the files in this folder.

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.031
If you have a readme markdown file below,
that will be shown below.

16
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:58.755
So think of it as almost like
the same way like if index.html

17
00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:03.773
will be shown if you want to view
a set of like static web assets.

18
00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:06.590
And you just go to
a particular folder path.

19
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.780
That is sort of the implied thing
that you end up looking at.

20
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.570
And so even as we drill through this,

21
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.260
like we can see that there are other
README's inside each of these folders.

22
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.910
So it's kind of nice to leave,
especially if you have a large team and

23
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.440
you have certain conventions that apply
within a particular area of your code.

24
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.100
Just create a readme within
that folder structure.

25
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.320
It doesn't just have to be the one
read e for the whole project.

26
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.030
But this can serve as
a good living document

27
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.910
that is versioned along with your code.

28
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.920
If these practices change over time
it's really easy to look at the history,

29
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.740
just like you would with code,
and to see how this has evolved.

30
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.960
So we're gonna look at
all of these different

31
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.890
markdown tricks that you can use.

32
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.360
The way you create images with
markdown is pretty simple.

33
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.570
You begin with an exclamation mark, and

34
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.960
then within square brackets you
have the name of this image.

35
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.760
And that's used to
populate the alt attribute

36
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.610
of the image tag that we're
seeing rendered below.

37
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.763
And then you can have a path to a file
here, that can be a relative path.

38
00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.530
So this one happens to be
checked into this project.

39
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.240
It doesn't have to be something
that's hosted in the CDN somewhere,

40
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.700
it's just, it is another file and
we can refer to it that way.

41
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.560
So, here is the way that ends up looking,
just so you can understand the size of it,

42
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.740
it's about the full
height of my editor here.

43
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.620
So that's great but

44
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.030
it's kind of limiting because we
have to size our images just right.

45
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.080
So if we wanted to deviate from that and
customize things a little bit.

46
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.210
Turns out you can also
use an image tag as well.

47
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.870
And this gives us the ability to
use almost all of the attributes

48
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.840
available on image tags.

49
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.610
You can't use things like source sets,
which are typically for

50
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.390
handling a retina version of an image,
an irregular version of an image.

51
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.520
That's a little bit too involved and
complicated.

52
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.980
But we can specify a height.

53
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.240
There's an align attribute and
think of that almost as it is a float but

54
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.256
it does even more things
than a float does.

55
00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:22.380
And we've got vpace and hspace and

56
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.680
think of those as horizontal and
vertical margin around this image.

57
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.090
So, here's what we end up
with with this mark up above.

58
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.550
You can see we begin with something
that is floated to the right.

59
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.980
And just like when we use like
a CSS float, it doesn't, when

60
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.420
you float something it doesn't really,
it ends up having no height, right.

61
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.780
So that's what lets us float to the right,
and then we can put something to the left.

62
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.310
And these end up sort of being
horizontally centered on each other.

63
00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.982
The reason this is not aligned up with the
top edge here is because we have got this

64
00:03:59.982 --> 00:04:00.971
vspace of 20.

65
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:04.019
So that is what is making
it come down like this.

66
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.810
When working with GitHub and this is where
GitHub and VSCode split a little bit,

67
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.510
it likes to wrap everything on
a particular line with the paragraph tag.

68
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.970
And so you'll see,
like if you have a bunch of images,

69
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.500
if we wrote this for example,
right and sent it up to GitHub.

70
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.150
Sorry, if we had a couple images like
this, right, without floating them,

71
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.000
like one two three,
VS code would show them as inline images.

72
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.020
Whereas GitHub would wrap each
of them in a paragraph tag.

73
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.622
The consequence for you is you would
see three images, one on each line.

74
00:04:42.622 --> 00:04:46.230
On GitHub, whereas here, you would see
them next to each other on the same line.

75
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.158
But this here, what we're looking at,

76
00:04:50.158 --> 00:04:54.116
that works,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There it is,

77
00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:56.260
that works on GitHub as well.

78
00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.640
Let me just get my zoom right.

79
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.491
So there's our little
floater to the right thing.

80
00:05:05.098 --> 00:05:09.472
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So this align attribute
works on a variety of elements,

81
00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:12.736
paragraph tags are a common thing to use.

82
00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:16.544
Because if you provide one GitHub
will not automatically wrap stuff

83
00:05:16.544 --> 00:05:18.660
in a paragraph tag for you.

84
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.823
So that's what let's us do something
like this, where we've got left,

85
00:05:21.823 --> 00:05:22.649
right and center.

86
00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:25.281
So if you want to sort of,
if you looked at the Readme for

87
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:28.672
this project you see we've got a little
image centered and at the top.

88
00:05:28.672 --> 00:05:33.760
And we've got our build status tags and
things centered right below it.

89
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.480
This is how we're able to do that.

90
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.530
You can do this in a poll request or
an issue.

91
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.887
Anywhere where you're using
markdown syntax this is important.

92
00:05:46.945 --> 00:05:51.509
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what I'm showing you
here is we have align top and bottom.

93
00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:56.358
And keep in mind we're dealing with
sort of a single like horizontal line

94
00:05:56.358 --> 00:05:57.557
of content here.

95
00:05:57.557 --> 00:05:59.675
But what we can do is use the top and

96
00:05:59.675 --> 00:06:02.932
bottom align to take these
two images to the left and

97
00:06:02.932 --> 00:06:08.620
float one like vertically align one up and
vertically align the other down.

98
00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.550
So the only way we're allowed
to see this is cuz we have

99
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.320
a larger image that sort of defines the
height of this paragraph tag, if you will.

100
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.337
And that gives us the ability
to take smaller things and

101
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:21.641
choose where we would like to align them.

102
00:06:23.832 --> 00:06:26.772
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Hopefully we've
all used unordered lists before,

103
00:06:26.772 --> 00:06:31.179
this is one the one of the first things
you'll typically learn as you'll start

104
00:06:31.179 --> 00:06:32.630
working with MarkDown.

105
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.400
So that will end up rendering like this.

106
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.620
We have ordered list as well and
you will note here so

107
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.780
we've got again the pattern is the Mark Up
and then how it's rendered is below it.

108
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.754
So you;ll note that I have got 111.

109
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.490
You could do one, two,
three if you really wanted to.

110
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.990
However, the benefit here is if we added
something into the middle of the list,

111
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:00.630
we would not have to go through and
explicitly renumber everything ourselves.

112
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.590
It'll take care of incrementing
that number as we go along.

113
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.690
One of the annoying things about
this kind of list is you can't

114
00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:16.304
use this syntax up here and
get nested ordered lists.

115
00:07:16.304 --> 00:07:21.290
We can fall back to regular HTML and
do something similar though.

116
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:25.380
But we've got ol for
ordered list, list items and

117
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.890
then we've got nested
ordered list in the side.

118
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:30.630
And we end up getting something
that looks kind of like an outline.

119
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.630
So this type attribute
is what gives us that.

120
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:35.615
If you were making a table of contents or

121
00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:38.382
something where you wanted
to refer to like section A,

122
00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:42.129
subsection one, something like that,
this would be a great way to do it.

123
00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:47.819
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So I learned about this
preparing for the course, there's

124
00:07:47.819 --> 00:07:52.055
something called description lists,
I've never actually used this before.

125
00:07:52.055 --> 00:07:56.231
But these come in pairs where
you've got a description, well,

126
00:07:56.231 --> 00:07:58.797
you've had a title and a description.

127
00:07:58.797 --> 00:08:02.304
And it'll render itself
as sort of the title and

128
00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:05.770
then it'll indent the description.

129
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.030
I'll show you how this looks on GitHub.

130
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:13.840
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Basically like that.

131
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.550
That is how it ends up being rendered.

132
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.870
So kind of nice if you had
maybe your contact information.

133
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:25.390
You can have name and
then a couple of things below it,

134
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.130
without having to deal with bullets or
something like that.

135
00:08:32.150 --> 00:08:33.780
This is my favorite here.

136
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.070
This, you will.

137
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:39.670
You will look like
a Mark Down wizard to people

138
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:42.150
if you start doing this in pole requests.

139
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.720
So, is there anyone ever reported
an issue where you've had to like

140
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.280
paste some log output like.

141
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.630
Mike, I'm having trouble
installing this project,

142
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.720
here is the error message I'm seeing and
you paste the big thing.

143
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.430
And this of course for
everyone reading this Issue.

144
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.890
They're gonna have to scroll
through everyone's log output and

145
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:06.540
like, other people will come comment on it
and say no, I get this huge log instead.

146
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.470
And someone else will say,
no I get this mega log output.

147
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:12.770
And before long it's like eight
pages that's a mile long.

148
00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.940
So we can use detail summary here.

149
00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:19.030
What ends up happening is, we get
a little collapsed element here, and

150
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.450
we can open it up.

151
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.080
And you see we were able to
use a Markdown inside of it.

152
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.300
This is a code block with
typescript syntax highlighting,

153
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:30.610
and you see that we can keep
that collapsed in here.

154
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.640
So this is a nice way to let people
sort of optionally open things up, or

155
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.500
I've at times used this for quizzes.

156
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.750
Where you have the question and
then you can open that up and see answer,

157
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.680
but the use has to click to open it up.

158
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:48.710
So this stands out because it's a little
bit of interactivity in your documents.

159
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:54.334
If you are doing this, keep in mind that
in order to transition from the HTML

160
00:09:54.334 --> 00:10:00.248
world Into back into the Markdown world
here you want to have an empty new line.

161
00:10:00.248 --> 00:10:05.550
Otherwise it will be seen as just
HTML text that isn't back text.

162
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:10.290
I can show you what that will
look like if we go down here.

163
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.888
If I were to delete that.

164
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:22.940
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah, see,
that is less impressive there.

165
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.520
It's just regarding this as regular text.

166
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.850
So just make sure that you have
that new line in there and

167
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.120
it should work out, just like that.

168
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.070
And by the way, the way I'm able to
get this little line here like this,

169
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:40.210
that is a block quote.

170
00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.523
So if we look at the Markdown here
that's going on behind the scenes.

171
00:10:43.523 --> 00:10:47.776
I'm just using these to basically
shift everything in and

172
00:10:47.776 --> 00:10:51.340
to give myself a nice little space.

173
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:55.350
So, we can really easily see like
this is code and this is the answer.

174
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.220
So, detail summary, use it anytime you're
pasting a giant like log output and

175
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.130
people will open it up if they care and
they won't, if they don't.

176
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:07.930
And of course, me for
something absolutely amazing.

177
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.360
That is summary that's appearing here.

178
00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:14.290
And then finally,
you can use tables in Markdown and

179
00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.490
you just have to basically, like this
is the Ascii art version of the table.

180
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.125
Be careful, because if you get
even one row incorrect here,

181
00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:23.899
I'll show you what happens.

182
00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:34.060
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It basically, let's see
if we can screw it up a different way.

183
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:37.930
Seems more tolerant than I remember.

184
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.491
What if we do that?

185
00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:48.290
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I am surprised that it's,
it's keeping up here.

186
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:50.062
I would not necessarily trust all.

187
00:11:50.062 --> 00:11:53.199
I'll Markdown renderers to
handle this gracefully.

188
00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:57.990
But you can see these tables
sort of basically unravel into

189
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.862
the row syntax again.

190
00:11:59.862 --> 00:12:03.267
And you just see a bunch of pipes and
dashes and stuff and it wouldn't

191
00:12:03.267 --> 00:12:08.210
understand that it should create a table
tag and table rows and table columns.

192
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.850
Wow, more robust than I thought
maybe I have to save it.

193
00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.820
Let's see.

194
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.550
Now it actually is handling it.

195
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:15.700
Bravo, code team.

196
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.670
So, those are my Markdown tips there.

197
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:25.640
Now, in terms of, if you had to just
remember one, remember details summary.

198
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.882
Just remember that and
if you remember two, align.

199
00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:36.985
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what I suggest you do,
one of the benefits of having,

200
00:12:36.985 --> 00:12:40.573
these slides as code within this project.

201
00:12:40.573 --> 00:12:42.482
Take notes as we go along and

202
00:12:42.482 --> 00:12:47.630
commit those notes to yourself as part
of these like exercise solutions.

203
00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.871
So we'll be going through and

204
00:12:49.871 --> 00:12:55.527
you can use some of these like tips here
to style your notes in some rich way.

205
00:12:55.527 --> 00:13:00.643
But just like with the key bindings,
as you start to like just incorporate

206
00:13:00.643 --> 00:13:06.310
a few things to start, don't try to
learn it all at once, it won't stick.

207
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.530
It never does.

208
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:10.157
But just pick one or
two or three things and

209
00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:12.722
try to focus on making use of that thing.

210
00:13:12.722 --> 00:13:16.258
And once it becomes internalized,
you will know when you've internalized it,

211
00:13:16.258 --> 00:13:18.136
you don't have to think about it anymore.

212
00:13:18.136 --> 00:13:19.660
And then you can move on to the next one
