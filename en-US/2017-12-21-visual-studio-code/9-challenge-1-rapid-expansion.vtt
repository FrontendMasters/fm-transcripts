00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.380
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so
we've got this grocery app,

2
00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.844
hopefully everyone's
been able to start it up.

3
00:00:04.844 --> 00:00:09.780
And what we wanna do is,
to the extreme right of every row

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.363
of like items for particular category.

5
00:00:13.363 --> 00:00:17.120
We're gonna add a little tile there that
basically says, click here for more.

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.970
So let's say we're showing
the first ten items.

7
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.707
And we wanna give people a place to
click to show me the full list of

8
00:00:23.707 --> 00:00:25.521
everything in this category.

9
00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:30.224
And we want something that kind
of looks the same as these tiles

10
00:00:30.224 --> 00:00:32.037
that are based on data.

11
00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:36.376
And so we're gonna have to create some
HTML for that and you'll note that each

12
00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:40.730
has its own little image here that sort
of matches the appropriate category.

13
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.670
So, where we'll need to modify things is,
it's in this file here.

14
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.478
It's a typescript React file,
so, it's a .tsx extension.

15
00:00:53.478 --> 00:00:58.070
Don't panic, we're gonna just be dropping
a HTML in there with a little bit of

16
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.730
dynamic variable just for the URL.

17
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.410
So if click that link,
you'll find yourself in this file here.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.020
And what you're gonna look for
is this thing that says code for

19
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.610
exercise one here.

20
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.290
And you're just gonna be putting
HTML below that line, or

21
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.170
replace that line in HTML.

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.130
But this is effectively a comment.

23
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.025
So whatever goes here,
think of this UL here,

24
00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:27.810
this is the horizontal
row of grocery items.

25
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.300
This here, think of that as like,

26
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.520
the array of items based
on data that we retrieved.

27
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.670
And then, after that, you're gonna
add one more that's just static.

28
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.240
It's always there of our list
of what data we got back.

29
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.709
And that's gonna look like
what we see in the image here.

30
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.112
That's gonna look like
these things to the right.

31
00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:51.240
So the per-category image,if
you start up your app,

32
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.845
it follows this form here and
you are gonna have to change this

33
00:01:56.845 --> 00:02:00.644
&lt;lower-case-category-name&gt; based
on the category name.

34
00:02:00.644 --> 00:02:03.408
All right so
you may wanna look in other places in this

35
00:02:03.408 --> 00:02:06.170
file.&lt;/lower-case-category-name&gt; to
see for example,

36
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.240
I see that there's like a word,
dairy, here.

37
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.004
And if I look up here like there might be,
looks like that's a category name here.

38
00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:19.870
So we may want to like follow that same
pattern of putting things between places.

39
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.840
If you've never used React that's
why I'm explaining that to you.

40
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.880
So maybe you can use that and arrive at
a conclusion that will get you a dynamic

41
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.290
piece of data in this large
static chunk of HTML.

42
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.230
And the point here is, use Emmet.

43
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.462
Even if you wanna take
a couple of passes at it so

44
00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:41.685
that you can figure out the thing
that would explain it all at once.

45
00:02:41.685 --> 00:02:46.164
And then experiment with how you
could explain it out step by step and

46
00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:47.587
save yourself time.

47
00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:52.230
Basically use this as a structure to get
comfortable with expanding things out.

48
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.610
This is the HTML structure
that you're gonna look for.

49
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.520
This question mark here that is for
you to fill in.

50
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.140
Remember this image is different depending
on what category we're looking at.

51
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.900
And you're gonna have to lowercase
the categories name in order to

52
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.265
get the right URL.

53
00:03:09.265 --> 00:03:14.423
For those who are not React indoctrinated
yet just be aware of two things.

54
00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:19.109
Number one in HTML,
that is in JS actually I should say,

55
00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.200
the stuff that looks
like HTML in this file.

56
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.080
You cannot say class equals something
to add classes to dumb elements,

57
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.660
the reason is this word has
a very specific meaning sorry,

58
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.640
this word class has a very
specific meaning in JavaScript.

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.474
And we cannot use it there, so class
name is what you'll wanna change it for.

60
00:03:40.474 --> 00:03:46.655
And then finally if you've never used
JSX before to mix static values and

61
00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:53.055
dynamic values, you will basically
have to construct a string like this.

62
00:03:53.055 --> 00:03:56.146
Rather than saying my
value is as a string.

63
00:03:56.146 --> 00:03:58.080
And then shift into the world of like,

64
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.170
here's the JavaScript
value that I'm omitting.

65
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.110
So you basically wanna
omit the whole thing.

66
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.970
You wanna construct the whole string.

67
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.960
I advise using something like
a template like this where we've

68
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.440
got out backticks and then this will be
evaluated as a job descrip expression.

69
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.340
So this should give you the little
tiny subset of react you need

70
00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.030
in order to make this work.

71
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.510
In the end you're looking for
something that looks like this.

72
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.190
So why don't we take about

73
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.640
let's say 25 minutes just in
case people have set up issues.

74
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.666
And in the end like you want something
that ends up looking kinda like what you

75
00:04:34.666 --> 00:04:35.432
have on the right.
