00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.750
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So the next exercise, and
I'm actually gonna go through it and

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.070
solve this right away cuz we do have
a couple more little steps here and

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.710
I don't want us to get in the weeds here.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.120
But what we're gonna do is
we're gonna tune our editor and

5
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.908
I've given you a couple background colors
and things to add in your customizations.

6
00:00:19.908 --> 00:00:24.514
And I've challenged you
to define your own syntax

7
00:00:24.514 --> 00:00:30.119
highlighting scheme using
coolors.co as a basis for this.

8
00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.431
So if we click on this,

9
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:35.520
you can see you have a variety of
different color schemes to pick from.

10
00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.480
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Do we need Flash for this?

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.960
No we don't, thankfully.

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.062
So, if you are at a loss as to what
colors look good together against

13
00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.527
a dark background,
this might be a good place to start.

14
00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:52.881
Where you could use some
of these as inspiration for

15
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:56.867
different things that would
make sense in a single pallete.

16
00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:03.063
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm gonna ask
you to disable the minimap,

17
00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:07.997
disable the indent guides, which are those
things that show you, this is one tab,

18
00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:10.699
this is two tabs,
various levels of indent.

19
00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:15.374
And then we're gonna add a place holder
image for basically adding, if you've

20
00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:20.288
never used placecorgi.com, it will give
you an image of prescribed dimensions.

21
00:01:20.288 --> 00:01:23.814
But we're gonna have two little place
holders in there that will let us

22
00:01:23.814 --> 00:01:26.619
just type in ph, tab,
and then, 300 tab, 200,

23
00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.180
and we'll have an image tag that
matches our particular dimensions.
