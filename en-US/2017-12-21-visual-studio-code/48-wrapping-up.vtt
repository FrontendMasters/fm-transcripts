&gt;&gt; Mike: So I hope this was helpful.

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.933
I hope that you feel like this
is a tool you know more deeply.

3
00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:13.273
And you can make it your ally in
building programs more easily,

4
00:00:13.273 --> 00:00:15.810
more quickly, more safely.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.215
And just keep an eye on new releases,

6
00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.440
because this seems to be
getting better every month.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.220
It's a really cool project.

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.506
And thanks for coming.
