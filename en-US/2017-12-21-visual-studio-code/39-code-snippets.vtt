00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.850
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So I told you we'd
deal with code snippets here.

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.580
These are extensions to Emmet.

3
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.470
Emmet is sort of the core
of the code snippet

4
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.930
functionality that is built into VS Code.

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.111
And we've got a couple
things going on here.

6
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:19.190
First off, you see that we've
got a name here called For Loop.

7
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.972
That is sort of the name of this snippet.

8
00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:23.945
And we're gonna start typing this and

9
00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:27.346
then hit Tab once it recognizes
we're working with the For Loop.

10
00:00:27.346 --> 00:00:30.199
And we will get this body.

11
00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.713
Right, sorry, we' re gonna type for.

12
00:00:32.713 --> 00:00:35.545
This will be shown in the tool tip as
sort of a description of what we're

13
00:00:35.545 --> 00:00:36.590
working with.

14
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.789
And then the body will
be pasted into our code.

15
00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.866
You'll note that we've got the \t here.

16
00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.025
So this is just text.

17
00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:45.973
It is your responsibility to make
sure that this turns into valid code.

18
00:00:45.973 --> 00:00:49.053
And you'll note that we have
a couple things that look like this.

19
00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:50.439
We've got 1:index.

20
00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:54.944
So basically the thing before the colon,
well, these are parameters first of all.

21
00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:58.630
Remember with Emmet where we could
tab between different things, and

22
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.702
we'd sort of fill in all of the blanks?

23
00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:03.734
This is what defines a blank to fill in.

24
00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:06.883
So what this is saying is
it's the first parameter, and

25
00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:11.715
the default we're gonna fall back on to is
index, or initially it's gonna be index.

26
00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:16.180
But the number 1 means that that index,
and this index, and this index here,

27
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.049
those are all gonna be kind of linked
together as the same variable.

28
00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.330
So as I try to rename something,
it should end up renaming all of them.

29
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.103
Let's see how that works.

30
00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:28.935
So this is our for loop.

31
00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:29.724
It's a user snippet.

32
00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.690
I have it in place already to demo to you.

33
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.975
Okay, so now when I, this is the first
parameter, and because those all were

34
00:01:37.975 --> 00:01:43.310
1:index, now when I turn this to i,
all of them get turned into i.

35
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.320
It's really three or four references
to the same variable, and so

36
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.310
it's regarded as one placeholder.

37
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.178
I'm gonna hit the Tab key.

38
00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:55.173
Now I'm on this array,
and so I could say list.

39
00:01:55.173 --> 00:02:00.048
And then the Tab key once more,
oops, I messed that up, didn't I?

40
00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:08.368
&gt;&gt; Mike North: i, Tab, list.

41
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.691
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Tab, thisItem,
something like that.

42
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:17.751
And now we've defined our for loop.

43
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.000
List doesn't exist,
that's what it's telling us.

44
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.255
So this is sort of Emmet working for
you in JavaScript.

45
00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:28.257
Where you can just have an abbreviation,
hit Tab, expand it out,

46
00:02:28.257 --> 00:02:30.520
fill in your placeholders really,
really nice.
