00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.304
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what we're gonna do now,
this is the last exercise I'm gonna

2
00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:08.062
ask you to do today,
is we're going to run this linter.

3
00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:12.127
It's called TSLint, and
this is the command that you wanna run.

4
00:00:12.127 --> 00:00:15.373
So we're gonna create
a task that will run this.

5
00:00:15.373 --> 00:00:19.330
Here is the sample output,
spits out things like this.

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.554
You can see that here is a file name,
here is a line and

7
00:00:23.554 --> 00:00:27.314
a column number, and
then here's a message.

8
00:00:27.314 --> 00:00:32.550
So we want to basically emit this or
we want to run this script,

9
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.014
which will then print these lines and
our problem matcher will detect this.

10
00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:43.629
And you should see problems start to stack
up down here as we find these linting

11
00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.198
errors.

12
00:00:44.198 --> 00:00:48.725
This is the equivalent of ESLint,
but it's for typescript.

13
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.533
So we're gonna create this custom task.

14
00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.268
I keep double-clicking.

15
00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:57.281
Create the custom task to run TSLint,
define a regex-based Problem Matcher

16
00:00:57.281 --> 00:01:01.530
to capture the output and
then fix all the bugs that it points out.

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.469
And if you want to learn
a new hot key here,

18
00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.527
F8 will cycle through any of the problems.

19
00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:08.397
So let's just worry about the tasks, and

20
00:01:08.397 --> 00:01:12.421
then in about 15 minutes
we'll go through it together.

21
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:14.799
Don't worry about fixing the problems for
now,

22
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.180
we'll do that together
once we get it straight.
