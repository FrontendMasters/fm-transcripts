00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.089
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So I'm going to
make a really quick commit, and

2
00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.088
we will fast forward with
the next section here.

3
00:00:18.243 --> 00:00:19.324
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Actually, you know what,

4
00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:20.430
I'm not going to use this.

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.480
I will show you how to make
a commit from within code,

6
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.730
there is source control built into this.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.080
I'm glad I remembered,
I'm trying to develop good habits here.

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.150
So the way you would do that is under
the View menu here, you see an SCM option.

9
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.820
And I've actually managed to like
remember this key bonding which for

10
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.110
me is shift and CTRL and G.

11
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.460
G for get.

12
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.740
And this is what we get.

13
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.132
It takes up this side bar area the same
way that we had our file tree there,

14
00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:56.447
there's this source control thing.

15
00:00:56.447 --> 00:00:58.636
You might have actually seen.

16
00:00:58.636 --> 00:01:01.831
If you had, what do they call that,
the activity bar,

17
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:05.850
you might have something like this and
is this icon right here.

18
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.650
Now, I take it away because we're not
showing the screen to everyone here,

19
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.520
this is not, it's not valuable for
me to have that stuff there.

20
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.490
But it's this right here, and

21
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.460
what we got is unstaged changes and
if we click each of these.

22
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.170
Let me zoom out a little.

23
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.180
If we click each of those we can
see we get a side by side dif.

24
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.190
So it's basically saying like here's what
happened, you've added these lines here.

25
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.572
And we can actually like
resolve conflicts and

26
00:01:37.572 --> 00:01:42.680
deal with staging and
unstaging selected ranges.

27
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.696
If you've ever used something like
source tree which is in that last scene,

28
00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:50.679
like stand alone get UI.

29
00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.802
It's really nice for like protect,

30
00:01:52.802 --> 00:01:55.823
like removing unnecessary
changes to white space.

31
00:01:55.823 --> 00:01:57.501
I can do lines that you may have added.

32
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:00.380
You can really clean up
your commits nicely.

33
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.860
So in this case I can say I
want to stage this range, and

34
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.689
basically add my cursor somewhere
in this code that I have added.

35
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.760
It looks like I've made
another change to this file.

36
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.260
Let's see.

37
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.702
Nope.

38
00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:20.230
That's a stage change.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's see what's actually

39
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.130
stage change.

40
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.460
Sorry, it was just that line.

41
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.240
So we can remove that unstage it.

42
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.610
We can just go like that.

43
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.890
Maybe we have to select the whole thing,
there we go.

44
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.180
So note that this file here used to be
under here under this changes title.

45
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.480
And that would have represented
an unstaged change, right?

46
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.760
Something that is not going to be part
of this commit that we're making.

47
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.740
I also it looks like I fixed that image.

48
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.250
As we started up it was like the image
wasn't relative path to that

49
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.960
visual studio code logo was not correct.

50
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.800
So we will stage that as well.

51
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.980
And in this case,
I am going to actually get the whole file.

52
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.651
I will just hit this plus.

53
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:07.137
And that's not an individual
chunk of code.

54
00:03:07.137 --> 00:03:09.430
It is the whole file.

55
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.510
If we had hit this button here,
that effectively

56
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.480
reverts the whole file back to whatever
the head of your current branch is.

57
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.320
So discard these changes, get rid of them.

58
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.940
We can add our commit message here.

59
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.360
It's gonna be exercise one, Emmet.

60
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.180
And you can hit this check mark or
command enter, same way you would

61
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.280
like the same key stroke for like submit
this chat message things like that.

62
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.200
And I've just made a commit we can tell so
down here I've got this little icon.

63
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.900
That says publish changes.

64
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.190
That's cuz I've never pushed this
branch up to my origin before.

65
00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.010
So I'm clicking that.

66
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.900
It's saying which Git remote
would you like to publish to?

67
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.910
And I'll send it to the origin,
and then from this point on,

68
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.870
now it's gonna change the logo
to this sync thing and

69
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.350
effectively what that does is it pulls
down maybe changes that might be available

70
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.800
on that branch, basically brings my branch
up to date, and then pushes my changes up.

71
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.600
So those operations together,

72
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.659
sort of synchronize a given branch with
whatever we've got stored on GitHub.

73
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.310
So it's a pretty nice UI,
and in particular,

74
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.490
if you're confident that you've changes
and you just wanna add everything and

75
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.030
create a commit and push it up,
that is fine with the terminal.

76
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.580
It's very difficult with the terminal
to look at the side by side disks,

77
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.150
which basically everyone should be doing,
right?

78
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.080
You've like the way, what ends up
happening if you don't look at things

79
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.760
before you send them off is you end up
like accidentally changing tabs to spaces

80
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.650
or doing unintentional last
meaningful changes to codes up.

81
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.710
This gives you a way to proofread it.

82
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.970
Let me show you another
thing that can be done here.

83
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.920
So I've just made another change, and
I can switch to inline view here.

84
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.660
It's probably more appropriate for

85
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.100
our purposes, like showing this on
the screen all nice and big for you.

86
00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.769
Note that now you've
got side by side divs.

87
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.890
It's no longer side by side, you have an,
side by side, you have an inline def.

88
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.890
So if we were to then say,
delete this here.

89
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.010
There you go.

90
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.000
You can't really see it but

91
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.060
the line my cursor is on is
highlighted in green right now.

92
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.740
So those who are watching
online can see it but

93
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.970
the projectors,it is a very light green.

94
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.310
So this is nice to be able to see like
what's been added, what's removed.

95
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.480
And you can select a whole bunch of stuff
here and cycle through various changes.

96
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.830
And say like I want to
revert selected ranges and

97
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.480
it'll like get me back to
where I was at before.

98
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.430
So, really nice for
looking at like chunks and

99
00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.640
get terminology, this will be like blobs.

100
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.390
Right, there are sections
of codes that represent

101
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.300
some mutations that has happened.

102
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.110
Some change that has happened.

103
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.120
That is a finer grade than you
usually have when working with get

104
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.410
through the terminal.

105
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.740
So I like this a lot, and
I'm going to start using it.

106
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.880
I might still pull and push myself
because especially for my purposes,

107
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.420
where I oftentimes don't want to re-base
a feature branch or something like that.

108
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:33.310
You don't necessarily want to do
that synchronization thing the way

109
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.660
that Visual Studio code does it, but for
forming a new commit, this is brilliant.

110
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.199
And I have no need for

111
00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.831
another get UI anymore.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so

112
00:06:44.831 --> 00:06:49.375
if I save this, we should see
that the file disappears from

113
00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:53.550
changes because it's now
like it is equal to head.

114
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.290
I'm completely lined up.

115
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.710
And down here, I've got the ability
to select branches, and

116
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:01.920
I've got no little asterisk
next to the branch name,

117
00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.185
which is what I would get
if there were changes here.

118
00:07:05.185 --> 00:07:07.118
That indicates like,

119
00:07:07.118 --> 00:07:11.237
I am forward from my head
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

120
00:07:11.237 --> 00:07:14.690
we've committed that and we will press on.
