00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.140
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's first deal with
the task of this UI customization stuff.

2
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.670
So I'm gonna open up my
user preferences here, and

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.215
I think I might've actually
had some stuff here.

4
00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:19.192
[SOUND] That is actually the solution,
fantastic.

5
00:00:19.192 --> 00:00:24.249
So what we're gonna do here is We've got

6
00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.457
some color customizations here where you

7
00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:35.376
can see,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: If you go down into

8
00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:41.208
this next line and just hit Ctrl+Space,
you're triggering this IntelliSense like,

9
00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:46.790
give me all valid completions You know,
with the input I've given you so far.

10
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.750
This is why I didn't attempt to list
all of the different things that

11
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.030
you can customize.

12
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.560
It is a crazy long list of all of
these different things you can tune.

13
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.270
Hopefully now you can see
that you do not to build

14
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.700
your own extension to define a theme.

15
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.310
You have like a thousand numbs
that you can turn here and

16
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.130
get things exactly the way you want them.

17
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.800
So if I save this,
we should see a couple of things changed.

18
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.383
Well first off, this text is so
late that I can hardly see it.

19
00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:21.150
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We'll do that,
there we go, a little more contrast.

20
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.460
So that's the active foreground and
then of this tab here.

21
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.770
You can see our peak views background
ends up being a dark red and

22
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.360
if we were to go to like cart store and
say

23
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.700
show me the definition of this peak
definition this is like a hard to see

24
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.540
in the projector were hopefully you
could see that video really dark red.

25
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.640
So all of these like this yellow
here that's badge here we can see

26
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.850
the background is yellow the foreground
is a very dark gray we could like.

27
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.886
Make it darker, turn this to white.

28
00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:08.490
You typically want to have, oops,
sorry, that is the panel background.

29
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.910
You typically want to
have a file open here.

30
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.110
So that you can see the effect that
it's having on these various things.

31
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.299
So let's talk about the snippets.

32
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.120
So those are the user settings.

33
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.999
Let me make sure I'm
taking all the boxes here.

34
00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.919
That should have taken care of this.

35
00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:31.110
I will leave it to you to do
your syntax highlighting.

36
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.160
I will show you what I've got here but
that's so I've got a text mate rule

37
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.700
That just for operators makes them bright
red, and let's see how that looks.

38
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.350
So here's my equal sign
that became bright red.

39
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.820
We've got any other operators in here,
++, bright red there.

40
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.223
So it just became like,
really easy to see in You know pop out.

41
00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:05.321
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Just be smart like about
your syntax highlighting cuz it becomes

42
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.380
a mess if you just tweak
it to too many directions.

43
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.000
So the next step disable my mini map and
the indent guides.

44
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.460
I've got that in place here Minimap
enabled false, indent guides false.

45
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.817
If I wanted to do a specific,
on a per file type customization,

46
00:03:26.817 --> 00:03:30.566
I could do something like this, markdown.

47
00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:35.810
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It would be like that,
markdown.

48
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.490
We could say minimap enabled is true.

49
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.530
And then here, I'm in a JavaScript file,
there's no mini map, but

50
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.450
if I went to this workspace,
now that's this thing over here, right?

51
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.140
Where we can sort of click around and
see everything.

52
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.758
So you can just use per file
type customizations like that.

53
00:04:03.117 --> 00:04:06.060
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
then finally let's do our code snippets.

54
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.880
So what we want is you're gonna
say open user snippets and

55
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.019
I just hit Shift Cmd+P and
typed in snip and there it is.

56
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.430
And you're going to have
pro language user snippet.

57
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.280
So here we are.

58
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.710
This is what I left myself to demo to you,
I'm going to update this so

59
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.120
that it does what we are looking for
it to do.

60
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.295
Sorry, we don't want JavaScript,
we want html [NOISE] Aw and

61
00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:41.873
here we go, so
this is the image placeholder SnipIT.

62
00:04:41.873 --> 00:04:45.280
Now what we've got here is a prefix.

63
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.170
So I can just type ph tab, I will get this
text here and then we'll regard these as

64
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.330
two different blanks to fill in or
I can just hit tab, tab, to fill them in.

65
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.911
So we can see how that looks.

66
00:05:00.886 --> 00:05:04.782
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Down here I can just
type ph tab, and that's what I get.

67
00:05:04.782 --> 00:05:10.529
And you see the other blank is ready for
me to tab into it, so 210 tab.

68
00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.490
Something like that and it'll just work.

69
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.840
So, particularly if you are building
the same kinds of components all the time,

70
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.270
there are libraries you can bring that
will give you some nice snippets here.

71
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:26.990
But, we all have boilerplate code
that we keep writing over and

72
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.100
over again that's unique
to our specific apps.

73
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.603
Really easy to write these things out.

74
00:05:32.603 --> 00:05:35.456
And they mesh so nicely with Emmet.

75
00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:37.443
Well, I believe we can even do this.

76
00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:43.041
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Oops all right, maybe not.

77
00:05:51.353 --> 00:05:53.480
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Nope,
it doesn't like it Okay.

78
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.490
So we're not there yet.

79
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.890
Can't mix with the core [INAUDIBLE] stuff,
but it behaves just like emit does.

80
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.010
And that you can tab and
then have the slots to fill in.
