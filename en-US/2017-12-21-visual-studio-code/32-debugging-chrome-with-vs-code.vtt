00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:04.555
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, so
that was on node, Chrome is very similar.

2
00:00:04.555 --> 00:00:09.167
So we create a launch configuration here,
this is not attach, this is launch.

3
00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:12.469
That's already exist in your project,
don't worry about copying this in.

4
00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.301
And essentially,
this lets us just create a new Chrome, and

5
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:19.684
to attach to it immediately.

6
00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:23.141
So we can launch this the same time as
our node debugger, Let me show you.

7
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:27.554
I'm gonna go launch Chrome, and

8
00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:31.340
then boom, and there it is.

9
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.590
Now you'll note, I don't,
I have some Chrome extensions installed.

10
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.529
This has no Chrome extensions here.

11
00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:41.830
It's a nice, clean,
standard environment set up.

12
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.121
And if we were to set up,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: A break

13
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.849
point,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Like

14
00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:56.118
here.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That's not a line

15
00:00:56.118 --> 00:01:01.409
of code here, have it in the constructor.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's kill this.

16
00:01:07.173 --> 00:01:09.761
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, start up Chrome,

17
00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:16.819
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Stop there, for

18
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:18.896
some reason, and there we go.

19
00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:22.230
Now, you'll note that in this
debugger thing, this is new.

20
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.139
So I can go between like, my Chrome and
my node, and if we look at the call stack,

21
00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:32.480
you'll see I've got two
different top level trees here.

22
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.373
So, this isn't just multiple threads,
these are multiple processes,

23
00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:39.719
multiple Java Script run times,
all in one environment here.

24
00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.175
And it's all based on one project, and
so, in terms of finding the files and

25
00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:49.116
things, we can just set break points in
one spot, and then like advance, and then,

26
00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:51.086
maybe our server side debugger.

27
00:01:51.086 --> 00:01:56.968
We'll pick up on others when we hit them,
it is pretty nice.

28
00:01:56.968 --> 00:02:02.872
And of course, we can reorder
all this stuff quite nicely.

29
00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:09.431
So, you would be hard pressed to find this
kind of thing built into a browser, right?

30
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:12.169
Browsers are generally are not
gonna be able to say, yeah,

31
00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:14.707
you can debug this thing that's
running in me right now.

32
00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:17.045
And simultaneously, connect to node and

33
00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:21.135
show it all in one window that's
seamlessly, tied to your source code.

34
00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:26.046
Not to rip on Chrome, but
that's like, they're a Web browser,

35
00:02:26.046 --> 00:02:29.721
not a full scale, like,
editing environment.
