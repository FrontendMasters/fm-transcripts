00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.060
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So,
the next topic we're gonna cover

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.740
is we're gonna a little bit
into work space customization.

3
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.220
So, this last set of topics is,

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.380
this had to do with customizing
visual studio code to meet our needs.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.810
And then we're gonna just touch on
the two elements beyond that tasks and

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.890
launch configurations.

7
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.790
So, we've already dealt with tasks, sorry,
we've already been working with launch

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.660
configurations, we're gonna
dive a little bit deeper.

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.030
Alright, let's kill this, cause we
don't need it anymore and here we go.

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.130
All right, so why would we want
to customize our work space here?

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.685
Well, first off, you spend a lot
of time in your code editor.

12
00:00:43.685 --> 00:00:47.365
This is the same reason developers
tend to buy decent headphones,

13
00:00:47.365 --> 00:00:49.796
like if you're listening to music all day,

14
00:00:49.796 --> 00:00:52.833
you may as well make it a good
experience for yourself.

15
00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.693
You may as well have a nice chair
because you're in it all day,

16
00:00:55.693 --> 00:00:57.783
and you may as well like,
tweak your editor so

17
00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:01.468
that, you know, it's not straining your
eyes, and so you can really review,

18
00:01:01.468 --> 00:01:05.780
if you open up a piece of code, you can
see what's going on with greater ease.

19
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.010
So what can configuration do for you?

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.020
It can noticeably increase your speed
if you get the right plugins and you

21
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.910
get key bindings set up so that you can
you don't do things quickly, that's good.

22
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.895
Just changing the look and feel can
make things easier to read and write.

23
00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:27.647
You can spot errors more easily if you
add things like static analysis tools and

24
00:01:27.647 --> 00:01:32.091
through color schemes you can
noticeably reduce fatigue and

25
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:37.980
give your eyes a couple of extra years
before you start to have vision problems.

26
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.000
Which we're all likely
to have a little bit,

27
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.060
but we may as well put that
off as long as we can.

28
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.330
So in terms of levels of customization,

29
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.640
you can do this in a couple
of different ways.

30
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.020
And this is,
these are listed from most specific and

31
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.840
highest Precedent downward.

32
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.530
So you can save some settings
right in the project,

33
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.100
like this can be part of your stuff
that you're checking in to get,

34
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.050
and this might be things that
pertain to this specific code base.

35
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.610
You can make that something you share with
your whole team, anyone who's using VS

36
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.010
code will like, read that file and
they'll get whatever's in that file.

37
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.500
Then you have user specific settings, and

38
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.500
these, depending on which OS you're using,
they're available in various places.

39
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.430
The easiest way to access them for,
on a Mac at least is command comma.

40
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.120
And you see we've got this nice little
like user settings editor here.

41
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.350
We will dive in in a moment.

42
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.660
There are the defaults
that chip with the editor.

43
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.760
That is the lowest level,
a complete set of preferences.

44
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.770
So if you haven't defined
anything in your project, or

45
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.130
it's a user setting,
you will get the default.

46
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.740
It's sort of the lowest level, but

47
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.310
you fall back to that if you
don't find anything else.
