WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.610
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what we're going to do
is create two new launch configurations.

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.750
One is for starting up our client with
an environment variable in place.

3
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.943
So we've got a web pack plug in that will
print out a nice little tree graph that

4
00:00:13.943 --> 00:00:20.440
will show us like, our app is how big,
and how does that break down.

5
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.960
How many kilobytes are coming from react
and how many are coming from react dom?

6
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.480
So, we'll do that and then, second,
we will use nodemon to continuously,

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.740
it's just, this is a commonly
used tool for node development.

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.100
And it will just restart a nodejs
program any time a file is changed.

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.410
Currently, if you were to edit files
on the back end of this project,

10
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.298
you'd have to actually
stop the debugger and

11
00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:51.470
then start the program again, in order for
those changes to be incorporated.

12
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.100
Like to be taken into account.

13
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.150
Nodemon it's just the same
as life reload or

14
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.330
as what we're using on
the client right now.

15
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.260
Some of you may have like
hot module loading working.

16
00:01:06.663 --> 00:01:08.643
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So I'm gonna go through and

17
00:01:08.643 --> 00:01:10.370
solve these right now.

18
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.210
The first thing we need to do is, I'm just
gonna copy this so you remember what that

19
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.580
environment variables is called, and
we're gonna open our launch.json.

20
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.980
Here, we're going to add an environment.

21
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.570
Actually, I can just
create a copy of this.

22
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.339
I'll leave that here, copy that, paste it.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

23
00:01:39.339 --> 00:01:44.930
we're just gonna call this
Launch Chrome and ANALYZE.

24
00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.365
Is that how you spell it?

25
00:01:49.365 --> 00:01:52.685
Close enough and,

26
00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.880
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sorry,
it's not Chrome that's interesting here.

27
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.900
It's building our program,
which is the node thing.

28
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.180
So it is front end, but keep in mind
it's the back end that builds it.

29
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.500
So we're gonna call this ANALYZE,
and I'm not gonna start with this.

30
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.430
I'm gonna start with a Launch Program.

31
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:31.658
So we'll call it Launch Program.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

32
00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:39.058
the program is at server/index and

33
00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:46.222
we can pass in env is ANALYZE true.

34
00:02:46.222 --> 00:02:50.570
Let's see.

35
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.550
Sure, I'll make it a string.

36
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.630
Let's see how this works.

37
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.060
So we can now, in our debug configuration.

38
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.484
We should see,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You

39
00:03:07.484 --> 00:03:09.820
should see a new thing here,
launch program.

40
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.390
Hit it and address is in use.

41
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.700
We can fix that.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: One

42
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.112
more time.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

43
00:03:29.112 --> 00:03:34.272
it's building.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Should be building

44
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:47.255
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, it's opened

45
00:03:47.255 --> 00:03:50.395
somewhere, there it is, it has opened.

46
00:03:50.395 --> 00:03:52.449
So, this is showing us what
our bundle looks like.

47
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.930
And we can drill down and

48
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.820
see like this is the part that's
coming from React and so on.

49
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.510
So now we have a new thing that's built
up based on our environment variable.

50
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.151
The last thing we're gonna do here is,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We

51
00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:13.400
wanna deal with this nodemon thing and
it turns out this is a common

52
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.459
enough need that there is a built
in nodemon thing that will just

53
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.767
work.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

54
00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:29.740
this is saying this is a node
thing we're gonna launch.

55
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.830
The name is called nodemon.

56
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.180
Here's the executable we're gonna use.

57
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.820
This is another example of
like run time executable.

58
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.110
There's our app.

59
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.136
Restart as true integrated
terminal never open, fair enough.

60
00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:48.677
So let's run it.

61
00:05:00.078 --> 00:05:01.819
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right so

62
00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:07.739
what we've got now if I go to index.JS,

63
00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:11.930
and I set a break point here.

64
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:22.778
I can restart,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Come on,

65
00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:28.734
you can come back.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All

66
00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:35.462
right we'll try again.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

67
00:05:35.462 --> 00:05:39.250
run it, okay, so we stop there.

68
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.340
We can let it continue forward and
if I were to change something here and

69
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.419
save it's stopping the debugger and
restarting it again.

70
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.680
Delete, save and
then we're hitting it again.

71
00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.620
So play through, down, save and
we're hitting it again.

72
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.870
So it's basically restarting
the program every time a file and

73
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.890
particular set of subset
of our project is changing.

74
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.390
Allowing us to work just as easily as we
do on the client with something like live

75
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.360
reload or every time we save
we see the browser refresh.

76
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.990
Here it is on the server,
and it just kinda works.

77
00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.300
So really nice to have this kind of set
up and to be able to integrate it so

78
00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.850
nicely with Visual Studio code.
