&gt;&gt; Mike North: When we're
thinking about key bindings,

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.790
so don't go nuts with key bindings.

3
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.250
It's better to be able to sort of
interchange with other developers.

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.980
If you have a pair program,
which you should,

5
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.280
it is good to sort of have
a standard set up and

6
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.550
not to have something when people sit down
at your machine it's mind-boggling, right?

7
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.850
Same reason you wanna have
a standard keyboard instead of some.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.020
I had a developer friend, that looked
like two bowls that he would type in.

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.006
I could never get used to that, and
so I could never use his machine.

10
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:40.940
You can bring in key maps which are,
there's one for vim, one for

11
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.282
sublime, one for Adam, one for IntelliJ.

12
00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:48.909
And if you're coming to Visual Studio
code, having already familiarized yourself

13
00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.440
with one of those other editors,
you can just find one of those.

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.830
So let's open up this
extension marketplace.

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.760
If you paste that string in here we can
see like here are all of the different

16
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.400
key maps that you can install.

17
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.430
That's a good starting point.

18
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.930
So basic customizations,

19
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.820
you wanna perform in the nice keyboard
shortcuts UI, which looks like this.

20
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.050
Sorry that is help,
I'll just use my keystrokes here.

21
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.140
So a really nice UI here where
you can sort through and

22
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.120
look through, there's a huge array
of different preset keystrokes.

23
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.630
You should be able to do
most of what you need here.

24
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.530
One thing I wanna point
out is this when column,

25
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.580
that has to do with context, right.

26
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.794
So this is saying the editor has focus and
it is not in read only mode, only

27
00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:43.742
then can we add a comment line, right?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

28
00:01:43.742 --> 00:01:48.278
if your needs are not met by what you see
there, if you find there's some action

29
00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:52.610
that you wanna bind a key to it, and
for some reason that UI doesn't work.

30
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.220
keybindings.json gives you
kind of arbitrary control.

31
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.980
And you would add little things like this,
a key, a command, and a when.

32
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.880
If you're going to keybindings.json.

33
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.480
You are customizing more than I would.

34
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.780
Because you're sort of in no
man's land at that point.
