00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.620
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So we're gonna go through
the solution to multi process debugging.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.880
The first thing we're gonna do is
just get our break points in order.

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.050
This is the one where I don't
have the correct link there.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.681
So I'm gonna open up cart-store and in
the save cart function I'm just gonna set

5
00:00:16.681 --> 00:00:20.030
a break point here,
before we send our fetch request out.

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.300
And I'm really just interested in like,
what is this?

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.940
That we're about to send out as
the payload of our response.

8
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.740
On the server side I'm gonna open up

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.720
this cart.js and it says look for
this put/items handler.

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.370
Up, there it is right here, put/items.

11
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.442
So I just set a break point right here,

12
00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:46.294
like all we've done is
kind of grab some stuff.

13
00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:50.782
Before we start trying to do anything
with what looks to be a database.

14
00:00:50.782 --> 00:00:56.489
Something or the other, we'll just stop
and have a look at what's going on.

15
00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.360
So the next step here is we want to,

16
00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.320
by the way, a pro tip here,
just cuz I'm seeing it now.

17
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.540
Notice how cart is italicized here,
as opposed to here it's not?

18
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.010
So that means this is what's
called a preview pane.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.290
Where we've kinda looked at it,

20
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.830
we can make an edit and
then if we go away it may disappear.

21
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.367
Like if we say I wanna go back to
cart-store that's gonna take the place of

22
00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.540
where we just were.

23
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.630
You can double click on the tab and

24
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.720
now it's like a full fledged thing and
anything else would be open up in new tab.

25
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.030
So you can turn this off if you like,
but I kinda like to live it on.

26
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.390
So good time for debugging.

27
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.590
We'll open open up our debugger panel
on the side just to show everyone

28
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.820
where that is.

29
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.760
You probably have an activity
bar that looks like this,

30
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.410
there's your debugger panel right there.

31
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.170
If you were somewhere else,
like the keyboard shortcut for me,

32
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.780
which I've kind of gotten
used to is Cmd+Shift+D.

33
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.948
Oops, you have to have something over here
selected, and now we're at the debugger.

34
00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:07.463
So, we can, we will

35
00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:12.520
kick things off here.

36
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.168
First thing we need to
do is launch this thing.

37
00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:23.929
Debug inspect,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

38
00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:27.020
we will attach to the node
that we just started out.

39
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.240
There we are at our break point,
we're gonna let it run cuz that's fine.

40
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.130
We didn't need it to stop there.

41
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.910
Next thing we'll do is launch Chrome.

42
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.380
Click the play button again.

43
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.136
If I look at the Chrome
that just started up.

44
00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:48.670
You can see we've got a similar like
break point there that it stops at.

45
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.130
Now the app's running.

46
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.200
So I want to hit this at the cart button.

47
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.610
This is where the arrow happens.

48
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.560
We've actually frozen that at our first
break point and we can see, here,

49
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.680
this attach here, we can rename our launch
configurations, in order to make this,

50
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.760
like, to make it a little easier
to see what's going on here.

51
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.010
But we could attach, we can see
that Chrome is what's paused here.

52
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.280
And if we look, we've got what
appears to be a list of items.

53
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.430
In fact, I can just stringify this,
go to my Debug Console, paste that.

54
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.671
And it looks to be an array.

55
00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:29.270
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's look up at the top.

56
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.440
Yeah, it begins as an array here.

57
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.350
Okay, so I'm just gonna let this play.

58
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.750
And where I stop next is now
I'm in my other debugger.

59
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.300
So if we look, Chrome is running now.

60
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.770
I can go back here,
I can scroll around, I'm not frozen.

61
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.490
I am now on my backend.

62
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.770
Now that was a pretty seamless transition
for popping between two debuggers.

63
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.180
So, what we can see here,
is we've got the context.

64
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.510
There's our request object.

65
00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.040
There's our body.

66
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.860
And then we grab a data property off of
it and it's not telling me anything, so

67
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.140
what's going on here?

68
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.160
And it turns out,
this ends up being undefined.

69
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.000
So it looks like this wants a data
property like wrapping this array.

70
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:23.160
So we would need to fix that or to say
like, we could test our hypothesis here.

71
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.632
Step to the next break point and
then say items

72
00:04:28.632 --> 00:04:33.820
= ctx.requests.body;, that's it.

73
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.215
Cannot read property.

74
00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:42.430
R-E-Q-U-E-S-T.

75
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.462
Okay, so
now items has we'd have to look over here.

76
00:04:47.462 --> 00:04:49.770
Let see.

77
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.181
Do we need to,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting.

78
00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:59.220
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I wonder if
we have to let it run here.

79
00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.840
See what happens.

80
00:05:02.292 --> 00:05:03.310
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Items?

81
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:04.350
There it is, okay.

82
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.530
So we didn't get a new look just
having set that in our console.

83
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.560
Our scope,
our variables panel here did not update.

84
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.040
But it has in fact been updated.

85
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.550
There are the items here.

86
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.630
So this should play through with no issue.

87
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.640
And it in fact does, and
that item just got added to the cart, so

88
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.320
I can pick another one here.

89
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.370
And I can do the same thing and you'd see
the cart kept another item added to it.

90
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.482
How will we fix this?

91
00:05:33.531 --> 00:05:35.132
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I just
updated on the client side.

92
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:49.770
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Now, you'll note that
what we just did is we saved a file,

93
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.120
which is part of this app we're
building up to serve over HTML.

94
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.910
Like serve with HTMLs and
external JavaScript.

95
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.230
We've got webpack kind of
built in into this tool.

96
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.330
So we won't even have to restart here.

97
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.440
Webpack kind of did this
thing on the next refresh.

98
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.990
We're gonna get the new
version of the asset.

99
00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.790
So let's add a new item to the cart.

100
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.120
Something that I haven't
had in there before.

101
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.060
Pretty sure I don't have this.

102
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.300
Okay, so now we can see, yeah,
we've got this thing here.

103
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.840
We've wrapped it appropriately.

104
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.330
We're gonna pop back
over to the server side.

105
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.390
Hey look, there's our data.

106
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.750
And so now we've just fixed this bug.

107
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.740
We'll peel back all our break points,
let it run through.

108
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.330
And now we see the number nine up here.

109
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.435
And there's our ginger root in the cart.

110
00:06:37.435 --> 00:06:40.754
So I've never seen quite so
easy a way to toggle back and forth,

111
00:06:40.754 --> 00:06:42.960
between two different states like this.

112
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.110
Two different fun times
that we're debugging here.
