00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.560
Or we can do some other things, we can do
max and min, and intersection and union.

2
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.650
I wanna provide a counter
example to monoids and

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.310
show that we can't promote a semi
group to a monoid with an identity.

4
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.928
So one example of that
would be interest section.

5
00:00:15.928 --> 00:00:21.280
So if I make intersection and I try to,
let's just copy my little template here.

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.045
And I try to say okay, well, I have
the intersection of this and that one,

7
00:00:28.045 --> 00:00:36.090
we'll use like low dash intersection,
right, of this and the other one.

8
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.110
And now how would I provide a value

9
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.168
that said, a starting value to get
the intersection of the list, right?

10
00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:52.293
If I concated that,
if I had an intersection of this list, and

11
00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:57.528
I wanted to concat that with
the intersection of another list.

12
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.046
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

13
00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:04.945
What would happen is if I
provided an empty list,

14
00:01:04.945 --> 00:01:07.290
nothing would ever intersect with it.

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.650
I would always get an empty list back.

16
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.825
If I provided a list of every
possible anything, that might work.

17
00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:17.530
[LAUGH] But I don't know how to do that.

18
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.660
So we're just gonna say that
intersection does not have an empty.

19
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.840
Therefore it is only a semigroup,
it is not a monoid.

20
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.120
And so that's interestingly a union,
we could just give it an empty list and

21
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.500
that'll be identity.

22
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.416
So, union is a monoid,
intersection is not.
