00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.298
Lastly, shapes.

2
00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:04.560
Can anybody name the shape?

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.135
Just kidding.

4
00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:09.221
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] I'm using this to represent

5
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:12.200
a bunch of different effect types.

6
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.090
So you have your async and your error
handling, and your event streams,

7
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.000
and we tend to model these
with types like the functors.

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.090
So you have your task and
your either, and your this or that.

9
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.520
And at the end of the day, these things
don't compose, monads don't compose.

10
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.250
And so what happens is, functors compose,
mono is compose, and we'll see that.

11
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.790
But if you have to use
a monad in your application,

12
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.990
which is typically the case,
these things don't actually compose.

13
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.932
So, we focus on normalizing the shape,

14
00:00:43.932 --> 00:00:49.131
kind of mashing them into the one
thing like the inside of a gobstopper.

15
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:51.241
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And then you can combine them,

16
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.085
and it's all happy, right?

17
00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:56.440
So normalizing the effect types

18
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.980
throughout the app is something
that you probably want to do.

19
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:09.230
I don't think it's necessarily necessary
all the time but, necessarily necessary.

20
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.601
It's just good guiding principle to have
a normalized shape of your effects so

21
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:17.900
you end up making maybe an app monad,
and everything falls into that.

22
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.560
And so everything kind of composes.

23
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.020
And there's different
strategies as we'll see,

24
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.200
we'll see free monads,
free monoids, that stuff.
