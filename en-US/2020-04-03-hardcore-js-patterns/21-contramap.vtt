00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.002
So contravariant functors are functors
that operate on their first value.

2
00:00:06.002 --> 00:00:09.383
So if I have a function from a to string,

3
00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:13.904
right, and
I know it will always return me a string.

4
00:00:13.904 --> 00:00:16.680
But I can take in any a to begin with.

5
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.200
I can map over the a and turn it into a b
but it will always end up on a string.

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.305
SO an example of that, and

7
00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:29.530
we could do this with sort functions,
predicate functions.

8
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.650
Predicate functions take in anything and
return a Bool, right,

9
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.970
sorting functions return an enum of -1,
0, 1, or something.

10
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.588
But we're able to map
over to the argument, and

11
00:00:42.588 --> 00:00:45.330
this is kind of like a superpower, right?

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.920
So if I start off with a function,

13
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.370
let's do Reducer because
that one's kinda fun.

14
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.370
So this takes, I'll say run.

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.338
And, what is Reducer holding?

16
00:00:57.338 --> 00:01:00.958
It's a taking an accumulator and an x or

17
00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:05.600
some a returning a new accumulator, right?

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.425
So, accumulators fixed.

19
00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:09.575
I can't map over it, it can't change that.

20
00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:14.655
But it can change each of these values
a to a b cuz it doesn't really matter,

21
00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:18.224
so that it sets like an input
type that I can map over.

22
00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.670
So let's go ahead and model Reducers.

23
00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:24.980
And we have a run function exposed.

24
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.120
And we have a concat.

25
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.060
So let's just so
how we can concat two Reducers.

26
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.260
We could take a Reducer, I'm actually
not gonna deliver that you can

27
00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.330
concat two Reducers just by merging the
accumulators or picking one or the other.

28
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.580
Let's do contramap.

29
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.355
This is the thing we're focused on.

30
00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.723
So, contramap takes a function f.

31
00:01:47.723 --> 00:01:51.314
And instead of writing map where
we would map over the output,

32
00:01:51.314 --> 00:01:54.504
we're gonna map over the input,
does that look like.

33
00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:57.649
We're returning a new Reducer
because we're mapping,

34
00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.820
we take our accumulator and our value.

35
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.104
And we're gonna run our thing
on the accumulator, and

36
00:02:04.104 --> 00:02:08.660
we're gonna hit that x
before it ever gets there.

37
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.461
So, what we've done is transformed
the value before it got to our function.

38
00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:16.578
And we're able to do these contramaps.

39
00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:23.220
And that is useful if you have a bunch
of functions you're gonna combine.

40
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.080
So, I can make a few Reducers.

41
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.376
We could write concat here real quick,
but let's say we have Reducer like login.

42
00:02:32.376 --> 00:02:35.094
And another we're gonna concat

43
00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:40.031
that with a Reducer that's
like change page or whatever.

44
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:44.831
And the thing is if I wanna run
this with just like a payload,

45
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:49.643
just some kind of like,
let's say this is like the action.

46
00:02:49.643 --> 00:02:52.778
It has a user and
the user has a bunch of stuff and

47
00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:57.053
it's got like an environment and
that's got a bunch of stuff.

48
00:02:57.053 --> 00:03:03.973
When I'm able to do is actually
contramap each of these functions and

49
00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:08.043
actually pluck values off the payload.

50
00:03:08.043 --> 00:03:13.549
So we'll get the user here,
And then we concat

51
00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.805
that with change page which should take us
make this the router or the current page.

52
00:03:19.805 --> 00:03:24.359
Change page should will contramap

53
00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.705
the payload and taken the current page.

54
00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:37.073
All right so, we've done is combined
two Reducers, both of them have

55
00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:42.139
been contramapped in advance to take
this one input and transform it into

56
00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.891
what they're actually looking for
as an input to their functions.

57
00:03:46.891 --> 00:03:51.305
And then, I'm running it with
some state and some payload new,

58
00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:53.360
get all those and run it.

59
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.084
So the point is, contramap hits
arguments before it comes in.

60
00:03:58.084 --> 00:03:59.620
That's part of the exercises.

61
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.050
So I wanted to call that out.

62
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.725
Does anybody have any questions
on how contramap works?

63
00:04:06.553 --> 00:04:09.880
Cool, this is going swimmingly,
stuff is hard.

64
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.840
[LAUGH] All right, so we have, yes?

65
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.493
&gt;&gt; So the purpose of contramap is
to keep the entire payload going

66
00:04:16.493 --> 00:04:21.351
through this system, but plucking things
off and passing it to inner functions?

67
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:23.280
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

68
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.350
That is one use case you can do,
you can say like I'm combining a bunch of

69
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.730
functions but
they all take different inputs, right?

70
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.760
And I'm gonna call run once after
I've combined all my functions.

71
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.000
So this is one use case I was using
reducers to say like, hey, you have all

72
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.660
these reducers that you've combined but
they all take different inputs.

73
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.710
Well we can contramap
before they get there.

74
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.930
So if you're combining functions into one,

75
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.780
you might wanna manipulate
stuff before they get there.

76
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.270
And this provides it's
almost like a before hook.

77
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.770
Whereas map would be like an after hook.

78
00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.637
So that gives you the ability
to kind of get in there and

79
00:04:57.637 --> 00:04:59.823
change the argument before it arrives.

80
00:04:59.823 --> 00:05:04.685
And that tends to really only be useful
in situations where you're combining

81
00:05:04.685 --> 00:05:07.990
functions into one and
they all take the same input.

82
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.810
And it's also useful in situations
where you have a fixed output

83
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.670
and the fixed output is static, but
the input is not, and you're able

84
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.760
to pre-compose instead of post compose
to be able to build out applications.
