00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
Let's now talk about
eventless transitions.

2
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.361
And, so i'm going to talk about why
eventless transitions exist and

3
00:00:08.361 --> 00:00:10.800
why you might want to use them.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.270
An eventless transition,
is a transition that occurs with no event.

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.490
So basically, it occurs immediately.

6
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.870
So, let's go to our scratchpad take
a look at what that looks like.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.090
Okay, so
i have this alarm machine over here.

8
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.350
And let's say that i also
want a greeting machine.

9
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.320
So a greet machine, i'm going to create
a greet machine, create machine.

10
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.020
And now here's where it gets tricky.

11
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:53.490
I want to say good morning or good day,
depending on what time it is.

12
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.021
Obviously, if it's afternoon,

13
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:58.180
i don't wanna say good morning
that's a little bit silly.

14
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.568
And one question that frequently
comes up is how do you define

15
00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:05.060
a dynamic initial state?

16
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.604
So basically how do you say i want to
start on this date on this condition, but

17
00:01:09.604 --> 00:01:13.935
i want to start in a different state
if that condition doesn't pass, and

18
00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:16.140
this other condition passes.

19
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.027
And the answer is to use
an eventless transition.

20
00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:24.672
So we could say, at first basically
when this machine starts,

21
00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:29.080
we don't know whether it's morning or
not..

22
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.180
So let's have states,

23
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.120
initial or sorry, unknown.

24
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.829
So in this unknown state,
this is a state where we could find out,

25
00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.110
is it morning or is it evening.

26
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.590
So we could have an eventless transition.

27
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.514
Originally, you specify eventless
transitions with an empty string

28
00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:56.950
over here.

29
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.842
In the latest version of x state,
even though that will still work,

30
00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:05.550
this has been simplified so that you
specify it on the always property.

31
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:13.168
So we could say, always go to the morning
states and so we'll have a morning state.

32
00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:14.582
Over here.

33
00:02:16.952 --> 00:02:21.590
And by the way, you could have
multiple machines in the components.

34
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.516
So you could say const greet state,
and we won't send anything.

35
00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:33.102
Use Machine, greet machine.

36
00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:40.870
And then, over here, i'm just gonna
make a h2 tag and i'm gonna say good.

37
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.934
And then i'm going to
basically see if the greet

38
00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:53.011
state dot value is morning,
then say morning.

39
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:59.695
Otherwise, say day.

40
00:02:59.695 --> 00:03:04.969
Now, when we get here it's
going to say good morning.

41
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.169
And it didn't say good day
because we're transitioning

42
00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.700
immediately from this unknown state.

43
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.320
And we're always going
to the morning state.

44
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.760
Now, what if we actually
do want to check the time?

45
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.147
Well, just like in the previous
lesson we could use,

46
00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:24.793
we could make this a guarded transition.

47
00:03:24.793 --> 00:03:31.510
So we could say a cont is morning, and
only if it's morning do we go to morning.

48
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.150
Otherwise, let's go to day.

49
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.020
So we'll add this new day state over here.

50
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.110
And now we also have to
specify that is morning.

51
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.690
So i'm just going to just
put this in line for now.

52
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.270
I could say return new dates
dot get hours is less than 12.

53
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.570
I believe this is going to return
a number between 0 and 23.

54
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.550
And so obviously if it's before 12,
it's morning.

55
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.640
Alright, so this should say, good day and
so it transition immediately to good day.

56
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.000
Because it's not morning,
the condition didn't pass.

57
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.930
And so that guard,
the transition is not taken.

58
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.560
And you're going to take this day instead.

59
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.617
Now, a word of warning since this always,
always, always gets called, when you,

60
00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:30.200
enter this state, you have to be careful
that you don't get into an infinite loop.

61
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.958
And you could accidentally
get into an infinite loop,

62
00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:37.380
basically, if you stay
in that state at all.

63
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.697
So if you have this condition and
you forget this day,

64
00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:42.920
then this is what's gonna happen.

65
00:04:45.563 --> 00:04:49.360
Or target morning should go somewhere.

66
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.640
Let's force this to be unknown just
to show you what happens over here.

67
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.448
So basically we have a stack overflow, and

68
00:05:00.448 --> 00:05:06.100
that's because it's going to keep trying
to go to that state over and over again.

69
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.660
So again, that's something
that you don't want to do.

70
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.648
Always make sure that, this is called
a transient states because it does

71
00:05:13.648 --> 00:05:17.264
have that,
it's basically going somewhere else.

72
00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:21.689
You're not staying in that state, you're
immediately either going to morning or

73
00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:24.040
day depending on if that condition passes.

74
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.101
So those are what's known as eventless,
or always, in other words, transitions.
