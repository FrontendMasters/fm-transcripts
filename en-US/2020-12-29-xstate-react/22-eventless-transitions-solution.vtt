00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.346
All right, so
let's take a look at exercise five and

2
00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:05.580
use event list transitions.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.107
So what we want to do is we want on these
running states to have a transition

4
00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:18.380
that basically is always taken
if it meets a certain condition.

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.651
So when running,
we always want to go to the expired state

6
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:30.021
if the total elapsed time
exceeds the duration.

7
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:35.144
So we could add always over here and say,

8
00:00:35.144 --> 00:00:41.322
always go to the expired
state on the condition,

9
00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:46.445
we'll take the context and we'll say,

10
00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.816
if context.elapsed is greater or

11
00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:54.756
equal to context.duration.

12
00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:59.877
The reason we have greater than or equal
is because our interval is zero.1 and

13
00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:02.760
JavaScript is really weird with decimals.

14
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.835
So make sure you have greater than or
equal to otherwise,

15
00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:08.480
you'll get into some
really weird edge cases.

16
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.003
That's a JavaScript thing
not an SQL thing ,all right.

17
00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:19.353
So this event list transition is
going to basically always be checked,

18
00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:23.320
but only taken when
this condition applies.

19
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.290
And you probably noticed that we got rid
of our guard in the tick transition too.

20
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.332
So tick is always going
to be doing its thing and

21
00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:36.764
you're going to see that's
actually important for

22
00:01:36.764 --> 00:01:41.849
us to do in the next lesson because we
do wanna keep listening for those ticks.

23
00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:46.781
So yeah, let's check this out and

24
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:50.450
see if our logic works.

25
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.464
All right, so 54321 it gonna go
to the expired state, which does.

26
00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:58.010
So we know our logic works there.
