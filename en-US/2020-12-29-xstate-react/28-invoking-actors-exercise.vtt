00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.938
Okay, so
we're going to go to exercise seven,

2
00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:09.183
which is invoking actors.

3
00:00:09.183 --> 00:00:13.788
And we're going to move
all of that interval

4
00:00:13.788 --> 00:00:18.019
logic that we have in the use effect, and

5
00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:24.008
we're going to put that in
an invoked callback instead.

6
00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:29.270
So yeah, so you can see we
removed the use effect over here,

7
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.650
it's no longer there,
even though it was in previous ones.

8
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.034
This same use effect logic, that's gonna
go inside of the timer machine instead.

9
00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:47.212
So in the running state, that's where
we're going to invoke that callback,

10
00:00:47.212 --> 00:00:50.977
which is going to send a tick
event on every interval, and

11
00:00:50.977 --> 00:00:55.153
you could grab that interval
from the context directly there.

12
00:00:55.153 --> 00:01:01.696
And yeah, so essentially we're just
refactoring the timer machine,

13
00:01:01.696 --> 00:01:07.050
so that that interval logic
is within the machine itself.
