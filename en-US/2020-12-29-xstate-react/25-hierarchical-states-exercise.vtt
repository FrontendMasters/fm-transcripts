00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.454
And so in this exercise, we're gonna
be looking at hierarchical states and

2
00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:08.850
implementing that same overtime logic
that we saw in the complete app.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.938
So the reason we want that to
be in the same running state is

4
00:00:13.938 --> 00:00:20.409
because we have this tick event that
keeps moving the clock, like that.

5
00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:25.530
And obviously,
we should have something that stops it.

6
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.173
But that's going to be
the running.overtime state.

7
00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:32.903
So we want two substates
of that running state.

8
00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:36.291
Normal, which shows
the clock is running normal.

9
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:42.296
And overtime, which allows ticks to make
updates to it, but could also be reset.

10
00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:46.790
And so yeah,
we're gonna be doing a few things.

11
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.991
So we're going to be moving the event
list transition from running to that

12
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:53.320
running.normal child state.

13
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.000
And we're going to be
making sure that reset

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.688
happens in that running.overtime state.

15
00:01:04.688 --> 00:01:10.068
But we don't want that reset to
happen in the running.normal state.

16
00:01:10.068 --> 00:01:14.080
So we're gonna be using a forbidden
transition to prevent that from happening.

17
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.900
Basically, we don't want to be able
to press reset while it's running.

18
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.470
So we want to forbid that transition.

19
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.884
And also, if it's going in overtime,

20
00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:30.380
we don't want pausing to do anything or
pressing toggle.

21
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.580
Obviously, we don't wanna pause and
play a timer when it's in overtime.

22
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.601
So just make sure that that
transition is forbidden as well.

23
00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:42.300
And just a quick review
on forbidden transitions.

24
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.442
The way you forbid a transition is
just by, for example, if we wanted

25
00:01:47.442 --> 00:01:53.220
to forbid this success transition,
we would say SUCCESS: undefined.

26
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.280
So we're defining the success transition,
but we're saying it's undefined.

27
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520
Nothing should happen
with this transition.
