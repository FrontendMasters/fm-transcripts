00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.920
Okay, so for the next exercise, we are
going to refactor our previous machine.

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.257
And so
we're going to be going to exercise 01.

3
00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:16.256
We're going to be refactoring
this to use xstates.

4
00:00:16.256 --> 00:00:21.690
So you'll see in timer.js, we have this
timer machine and you could just copy and

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.101
paste the same machine that you
created in exercise zero for that or

6
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:30.142
you could copy and
paste it from the timer machine over here.

7
00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:34.815
And over here,
this is going to be replaced with use

8
00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:39.280
machine instead,
which is imported over here.

9
00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.891
So all you have to do is
uncomment that and import it and

10
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.280
pretty much everything else from
exercise zero stays the same.

11
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.520
So you're going to want that
same onClick handler over here,

12
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.890
except call it send instead of dispatch.

13
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.376
Basically the same thing.

14
00:00:56.376 --> 00:01:03.107
And yeah, so, again,
we're refactoring the machine from or

15
00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:10.240
the component from exercise zero
to use xstate react instead.

16
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.390
And that use machine hook.

17
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.960
So are there any questions
before we start this exercise?

18
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.376
&gt;&gt; The exercise page says
to install xstate and

19
00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:22.120
react xstate that's in our
package locked already, right?

20
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so installation instructions
over here it says to install xstate and

21
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.950
xstate react.

22
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.275
This is just in general,
if you're doing a reacts project,

23
00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.240
you do wanna do those steps as well.

24
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.916
But since it's already done for you,
when you installed this create react app,

25
00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:40.790
it's going to be there for you.
