00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:06.250
Okay, so let's get to exercise 4,
which is on guarded transitions.

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.280
This exercise is basically to
fix the logic that we have here.

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.701
I put the timer at the 5 seconds
to make it easier to test, but

4
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:23.830
right now when you click the timer,
it goes to 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

5
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.990
And then it just sort of keeps going.

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.331
So what we want to do,

7
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:32.560
is we want to use guarded transitions to
basically make sure that doesn't happen.

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.224
So, the first goal whenever
a tic event happens,

9
00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:40.157
we only want to increments the context,

10
00:00:40.157 --> 00:00:45.790
that elapsed when incrementing it
won't exceed the context duration.

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.160
So, you're going to
have a guard that says,

12
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.975
does context duration plus
context dot interval,

13
00:00:52.975 --> 00:00:59.280
this context that elapsed plus context
dot interval exceed the duration.

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.778
If so,
we wants to go to in expired states.

15
00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:08.634
Otherwise, we wanna just keep doing
the same thing we were doing before.

16
00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.184
And then like we just talked about,

17
00:01:11.184 --> 00:01:17.000
you can also parameterize that cond and
optionally put it in the guards.

18
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.687
And so in the expired state,

19
00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:22.005
we also want to reset events
to transition back to idle.
