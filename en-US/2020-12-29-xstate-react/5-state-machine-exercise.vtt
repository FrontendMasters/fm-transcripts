00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.560
Okay, so
let's get into the first exercise.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.797
What you should do if you're
on the main screen over here,

3
00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:14.000
go ahead and click Exercise 00,
Creating a state machine.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.224
And so in this exercise, we're going to be
doing the exact same thing that I showed

5
00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:22.900
you, which is creating a state machine
from scratch and putting it in useReducer.

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.010
Again, you could either use
switch case statements or

7
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.850
you could use that Object Notation
that I showed you.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.375
So our state machine is going to have
three states, idle, running and paused.

9
00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.840
So idle means the timer
hasn't started yet.

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.652
Running means the timer is
currently counting down,

11
00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:45.690
which is not going to work yet
because we haven't added the ticker yet.

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.620
That's for a future exercise.

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.760
And, we have the paused state, so that
you could pause the timer at any time.

14
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.600
The machine should start in the idle stat
and then when the toggle event happens,

15
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.960
where basically toggling
between running and paused.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.810
So that's what that play
button is going to do here.

17
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.757
We also have a reset button here,

18
00:01:06.757 --> 00:01:13.400
where it's going to allow you to
just start the machine back in idle.

19
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.460
And so
that should happen in the paused state.

20
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.572
And so
those toggle events should be dispatched

21
00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:24.800
when you click this start timer and
pause timer.

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.940
You'll see that the buttons
switches between start and pause.

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.021
And also if you click this, that should
also do the same thing as that button.

24
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:34.810
And honestly,

25
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.944
that's where that logic just centralizing
that logic becomes really helpful.

26
00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:43.284
So that instead of copying and pasting
your logic for both this and the button,

27
00:01:43.284 --> 00:01:47.640
you could just dispatch the same events
and that's going to do the same thing.

28
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.695
There's also some restrictions like
only show the pause timer when you're in

29
00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:54.160
the running state.

30
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.728
Obviously, you don't wanna pause
in the already paused timer and

31
00:01:57.728 --> 00:02:01.650
only show the start timer button
when we're either in paused or idle.

32
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.994
You don't wanna show the play
button when it's already playing.

33
00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:10.884
Which sounds like how could anyone
make that mistake but honestly,

34
00:02:10.884 --> 00:02:16.471
at the time of this workshop, there's
a lot of election news sites going on.

35
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:19.246
And some of the videos have that play
button, where you keep pressing play and

36
00:02:19.246 --> 00:02:20.021
it doesn't go away.

37
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:23.740
Or even if the video is already playing,
it shows that play button or

38
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.780
it shows the pause button
at the wrong time.

39
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.095
State machines just make you notice
all of these logic problems.

40
00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:31.991
So, yeah, all right?

41
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:36.950
The exercise material is going
to be in these two files.

42
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.280
We have timer.js.

43
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.878
And you're going to see a lot of
hints on how you should do this just

44
00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:48.950
throughout the file, especially
these comments with the three dots.

45
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.210
That's usually an indication that
you should be doing something there.

46
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:58.485
And there's also this timer machine file,
which this is going to be that reducer.

47
00:02:58.485 --> 00:03:03.249
So you could create this however you want.

48
00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.394
If you wanna use the objects,
there's this timer machine config or

49
00:03:06.394 --> 00:03:08.004
you could use a switch statement.
