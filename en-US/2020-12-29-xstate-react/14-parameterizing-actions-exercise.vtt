00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:05.257
&gt;&gt; So, let's get onto the next exercise,
which is exercise number three,

2
00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:08.118
this should be pretty simple exercise.

3
00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:13.235
What we're going to be doing is we're
going to be using the actions that we

4
00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:18.940
created in exercise two, which you'll see
are already in the machine over here.

5
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:24.060
And we're going to be parameterizing them,
so basically moving them out,

6
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.986
giving them names such as tick,
add minute, and resets.

7
00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:32.236
And if you want, you could add them to

8
00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:37.731
the actions over here,
but that's optional.

9
00:00:37.731 --> 00:00:42.537
So in general, just moving this and
this entry, we're gonna be

10
00:00:42.537 --> 00:00:48.144
parameterizing both of them and
we're also gonna be doing one more thing,

11
00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:52.507
we're introducing a new event,
which is the tick event.

12
00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:56.995
What that's going to do,
is it's going to increments

13
00:00:56.995 --> 00:01:01.484
the elapsed time by the interval
on every interval, so

14
00:01:01.484 --> 00:01:06.673
we're going to be modeling that just for
now with use effects.

15
00:01:06.673 --> 00:01:10.568
And so, you should also add
a use effect over here to

16
00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:13.473
send a tick events on every interval.

17
00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:19.393
So basically, you're going to be using set
interval to do this, make sure to clean

18
00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:25.158
up that interval using clear interval in
the cleanup function of the use effect.

19
00:01:25.158 --> 00:01:28.733
And every single one of those intervals,

20
00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:32.621
you're going to be
sending that tick event.

21
00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:38.421
And the tick event should increments
the elapsed by context done interval.
