00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:05.920
All right, so let's start exercise 2,
which is on context.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.160
We're going to be using
context to hold some

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.868
extended states within
our timer application.

4
00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:17.193
Now, if we go back to complete,

5
00:00:17.193 --> 00:00:21.768
you could sort of see where that
extended state comes in handy.

6
00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:27.368
We want to keep this value over here,
which is the current time or

7
00:00:27.368 --> 00:00:32.356
the time that has elapsed
basically the time remaining.

8
00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:36.397
But we also wants to keep
what the original time was.

9
00:00:36.397 --> 00:00:40.515
So, see we have duration,
which could be something

10
00:00:40.515 --> 00:00:45.102
like 60 seconds because this
is a minute timer elapsed,

11
00:00:45.102 --> 00:00:49.144
which is how much time has
elapsed in the interval.

12
00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:56.598
This interval is mainly for counting down
and we don't have to worry about that yet.

13
00:00:56.598 --> 00:01:01.860
Instead, we're just going to be
worrying about duration elapse,

14
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.211
but also add that interval
to the state context object.

15
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.950
So, in this exercise, we go to number 2.

16
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.504
You'll also notice that there's
a few extra buttons too.

17
00:01:14.504 --> 00:01:20.285
So we have this plus 1 and
so clicking that button

18
00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:25.507
should assign 1 minutes to this interval.

19
00:01:25.507 --> 00:01:30.943
And so reset should also take
the elapsed time back to 0.

20
00:01:30.943 --> 00:01:34.911
And so that's what the reset
functionality is for.

21
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:40.362
So, basically, we are modifying context in

22
00:01:40.362 --> 00:01:45.964
this timer app and
follow the goals over here.

23
00:01:45.964 --> 00:01:47.900
And yeah, good luck.
