1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.773
Okay, so how do MVPs or minimum viable
products apply to accessibility,

2
00:00:04.773 --> 00:00:07.580
especially if you are in
a waterfall system?

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.899
There is this well-known
concept in agile software

4
00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.046
development of the minimum viable product,
or MVP.

5
00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:19.802
And the idea is to produce iterations
of a product that meet a customer

6
00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.693
need every step of the way.

7
00:00:21.693 --> 00:00:24.927
As opposed to trying to get it all in,
in this mammoth

8
00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:29.967
giant build that takes forever and
goes over budget, we wanna increment.

9
00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:34.678
We wanna get to sort of a picture
this graphic on the screen,

10
00:00:34.678 --> 00:00:39.955
where it's instead of single wheels
in the goal of building a car,

11
00:00:39.955 --> 00:00:45.810
we go from a skateboard to a scooter
to a bike to a motorcycle to a car.

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.200
So it has less features, and maybe it
works slightly differently, but if we can

13
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.264
ship something that works to accomplish
at least part of a customer need,

14
00:00:54.264 --> 00:00:56.320
then we can build on that.

15
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.088
And so, for accessibility,

16
00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:02.313
I like that metaphor because
sometimes that's what we need to do.

17
00:01:02.313 --> 00:01:07.177
We can't just go and rip everything out
and ship the perfect component fix,

18
00:01:07.177 --> 00:01:08.783
sometimes you can.

19
00:01:08.783 --> 00:01:13.302
Sometimes I can't even touch that part of
the code if it's not part of the ticket

20
00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:18.553
that I'm working on, I work in a pretty
restrictive environment like that.

21
00:01:18.553 --> 00:01:23.225
So we have to find ways that we can ship
things on time that are still accessible.

22
00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:29.405
The unfortunate reality is that a lot
of early phase product launches don't

23
00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:31.092
include accessibility.

24
00:01:31.092 --> 00:01:36.318
I mean, it's the easiest way to get
people coming with torches to yell at you

25
00:01:36.318 --> 00:01:41.546
on Twitter if you launch something
that doesn't have accessibility in it,

26
00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:42.785
it's not great.

27
00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:46.539
And it's because people are so
frustrated about this, they're like,

28
00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.766
why can't we think about
accessibility earlier?

29
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:53.451
We hear things like, it's an alpha
version, don't worry about it,

30
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:56.269
we're just getting started,
we'll ship it later.

31
00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:58.983
I mean, they're doing their best,
I understand, but

32
00:01:58.983 --> 00:02:00.671
I think we can do better than that.

33
00:02:00.671 --> 00:02:06.566
And so, part of my goal as I've matured
and learned, is when you point that stuff

34
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:12.751
out, be kind about it, the pitchforks and
torches are probably a bad idea.

35
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:16.066
Cuz we want people to learn about it,
we wanna be like, hey,

36
00:02:16.066 --> 00:02:19.795
this is great,
I really like how you did this part.

37
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:24.568
I wish it had accessibility included
in the beginning because it would be

38
00:02:24.568 --> 00:02:26.691
just more successful that way.

39
00:02:26.691 --> 00:02:30.293
I think the challenge is that,
we do that over and over,

40
00:02:30.293 --> 00:02:32.833
and it just is continually forgotten.

41
00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:36.388
So if you're building an early
stage product, be a hero and

42
00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:39.589
a champion [LAUGH] by
including accessibility early,

43
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.710
because you can incorporate it
into the DNA of the product.

44
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.934
You could potentially handle use cases
that would be really hard to add after

45
00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.300
the fact.

46
00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.725
And so, you do this by incorporating
accessibility in planning, in design,

47
00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:58.080
not just like, dang, we caught it in QA,
now we have to go and try and

48
00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.462
jam changes back into earlier parts of
the software development life cycle.

49
00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:08.700
So there's a quote in the article
by Henrik Nyberg who wrote or

50
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.912
created that original MVP graphic.

51
00:03:11.912 --> 00:03:13.932
He had the idea of,
what's the cheapest and

52
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:17.002
fastest way that we can
make something usable?

53
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:20.108
And I kind of took a spin on that and
thought what's the cheapest and

54
00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:23.670
fastest way we can make
something usable and accessible?

55
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.540
Note, I have to do a big caution.

56
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.788
I am not talking about adding an overlay,
which is a one line of code fix that

57
00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:35.458
claims to make your site accessible,
that is not what we're talking about here.

58
00:03:35.458 --> 00:03:39.651
Cuz that's, yeah,
outside of the scope of this talk.

59
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:43.211
But I think if we can
create iterations and

60
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:48.196
phases where we kind of ship
something that's solid, but

61
00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:52.432
just does fewer things and
then we build on that.

62
00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:57.268
The next version of this will be more
interactive or we'll have one widget that

63
00:03:57.268 --> 00:04:02.105
can do more functions instead of having
a toggle between two different views or

64
00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:03.519
something like that.

65
00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.557
Technical debt applies to
accessibility big time, and

66
00:04:08.557 --> 00:04:11.989
it's why it becomes so
costly to do it later.

67
00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.869
And parts of MVPs, some of those live
on in design decisions and code,

68
00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:20.883
those early prototypes,
the work in progress.

69
00:04:20.883 --> 00:04:24.799
How many times do you see WIP commits and
code that live on forever and

70
00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:26.843
all kinds of projects.

71
00:04:26.843 --> 00:04:31.479
So those decisions, I've actually heard
them described as layers of sediment,

72
00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.263
which I thought was really interesting.

73
00:04:34.263 --> 00:04:38.598
Yeah, kind of a nature theme to think
about, or tree rings, or something, and

74
00:04:38.598 --> 00:04:41.218
it's like these decisions live on.

75
00:04:41.218 --> 00:04:46.211
And so, if we make decisions early on
about how we architect our frontend code,

76
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:49.698
in particular,
we can make it easier for ourselves.

77
00:04:49.698 --> 00:04:53.710
Cuz it is hard to recover from this
debt without significant re-imagining,

78
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.498
re-platforming, and
essentially starting over.

79
00:04:58.286 --> 00:05:01.406
So just do less,
if you can't make it accessible, do less.

80
00:05:02.716 --> 00:05:07.589
Add a widget that people can toggle
between, if you have a really fancy

81
00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:11.718
table that you can sort, but
it only works for mouse users,

82
00:05:11.718 --> 00:05:17.896
provide an alternative format that's easy
to get to, that's pleasant to all users.

83
00:05:17.896 --> 00:05:21.663
We don't wanna ship people
off to text-only, boring,

84
00:05:21.663 --> 00:05:26.214
non-maintained sites, but
it is okay to have lower five versions,

85
00:05:26.214 --> 00:05:30.614
especially early on, that then you go and
iterate on and improve.

86
00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:32.594
Make it part of your culture,

87
00:05:32.594 --> 00:05:37.354
make it an accountability culture
that's friendly, not cutthroat.

88
00:05:37.354 --> 00:05:42.181
[LAUGH] But I think the culture piece
is what's missing a lot of the time.

89
00:05:42.181 --> 00:05:43.413
So, how do we do this?

90
00:05:43.413 --> 00:05:47.578
In the software development lifecycle,
as I was saying,

91
00:05:47.578 --> 00:05:51.152
we wanna tackle it earlier
than catching it in QA.

92
00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:55.994
So, we wanna consider accessibility
earlier, what we call shifting left,

93
00:05:55.994 --> 00:06:01.293
cuz we wanna consider it and planning,
design, engineering, content strategy.

94
00:06:01.293 --> 00:06:05.719
Basically any time that decisions
are being made about what users

95
00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.902
are going to see and experience,
if we can plan ahead of time,

96
00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:15.914
we could prevent some re-work, some cycles
of the feedback loop of, does it work?

97
00:06:15.914 --> 00:06:19.511
And we test it, goes to QA,
we feel like start over, just that loop,

98
00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:21.644
you can cut that down.

99
00:06:21.644 --> 00:06:24.656
It gets really hard when
some of the things you

100
00:06:24.656 --> 00:06:28.946
have to change are really core to
the product like brand colors.

101
00:06:28.946 --> 00:06:33.854
If you can't make colors past visual
contrast ratios without changing it so

102
00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:37.766
much that your orange looks brown,
you just can't fiddle,

103
00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:41.392
you can't tweak those colors
enough to make that work.

104
00:06:41.392 --> 00:06:46.465
You have to go back to your design
team and your brand people,

105
00:06:46.465 --> 00:06:52.334
and try to come up with a solution
that can be hard with T-Mobile pink,

106
00:06:52.334 --> 00:06:59.614
or some color like that, pink and white,
the pink can't get any pinker, that's it.

107
00:06:59.614 --> 00:07:02.957
Or if your whole app is
built in HTML5 Canvas,

108
00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:07.600
that's kind of hard to change and
very hard to make accessible.

109
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.972
There were some claims that you could
do that, but it's just not the same.

110
00:07:11.972 --> 00:07:14.471
I'm a Figma,
that's what they're dealing with.

111
00:07:14.471 --> 00:07:20.122
That's a Canvas-based application that
is very hard to go in and change.

112
00:07:21.372 --> 00:07:23.242
They're working on it, bless them.

113
00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:25.132
They're awesome, but that's hard.

114
00:07:27.122 --> 00:07:29.642
And so, we'll have the most success
when we consider it earlier.

115
00:07:29.642 --> 00:07:33.232
All right, we're doing this in Canvas,
should we?

116
00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:35.162
What are we gonna do to
make this accessible?

117
00:07:35.162 --> 00:07:37.497
That's a tough thing to overcome later on.

118
00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:43.057
So what kinds of things need
to be addressed in design?

119
00:07:43.057 --> 00:07:45.960
I mean, contrast, colors, that was one.

120
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.920
I mean, you could be assigned
a drag-and-drop widget that to

121
00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:53.446
make it accessible,
we're going to work on one later.

122
00:07:53.446 --> 00:07:58.237
And I happen to know from working on
those that sometimes you have to change

123
00:07:58.237 --> 00:08:00.027
the design to make it work.

124
00:08:00.027 --> 00:08:04.347
And design might have already
been signed-off on months ago,

125
00:08:04.347 --> 00:08:06.956
depending on how your process works,

126
00:08:06.956 --> 00:08:12.189
it could be a totally different company
that made that, so that can be hard.

127
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:18.379
So, yeah, some things like, you can only
finesse it so much as a dev, you have to

128
00:08:18.379 --> 00:08:24.776
understand that you might need to open up
some design cycles to really get it right.

129
00:08:26.156 --> 00:08:28.413
And so, yeah, just keep that in your mind,

130
00:08:28.413 --> 00:08:32.927
in the back of your mind when you're doing
sprint planning, you're thinking about how

131
00:08:32.927 --> 00:08:36.956
is this work gonna get done, yeah,
know that you might need some design help.

132
00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:43.191
And so, we had some kind of questions,
thoughts around how to convince

133
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:47.529
stakeholders, because it's the stuff
people don't always wanna do.

134
00:08:47.529 --> 00:08:51.658
There is a bit of an art to this, and
depending on what motivates people,

135
00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:56.281
that's part of what makes it an art, is
like finding out what matters to people.

136
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.733
Some people might respond to a carrot,

137
00:08:58.733 --> 00:09:01.569
some people might respond
better to a stick.

138
00:09:01.569 --> 00:09:04.758
And so, those approaches, it's kind of
exhausting having to think about that.

139
00:09:04.758 --> 00:09:09.572
But if we wanna get this work done right,
sometimes we have to think about this.

140
00:09:09.572 --> 00:09:10.327
So what do people care about?

141
00:09:10.327 --> 00:09:14.440
Legal risk and compliance,
maybe, lost revenue,

142
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.843
possibly, brand reputation,
that could be a big one.

143
00:09:20.093 --> 00:09:23.756
So my strategy is to tackle these
tasks and phases, find easy wins,

144
00:09:23.756 --> 00:09:28.061
find things you've already done, and
you can say, hey, look, we did this and

145
00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:29.499
you didn't even notice.

146
00:09:29.499 --> 00:09:32.473
Think about,
if we put a little bit more emphasis here,

147
00:09:32.473 --> 00:09:34.191
how much more we could get done?

148
00:09:34.191 --> 00:09:39.391
And here are some prioritized
issues at least a quick pass at

149
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:46.259
that to think about how much work we need
to do, make it easy for them to say yes.

150
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:51.338
So that's what I would do anyway,
especially as a tech lead.

151
00:09:51.338 --> 00:09:56.259
And when you combine that with kind of the
MVP approach of having something that you

152
00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:59.989
can do in phases, something that
works every step of the way.

153
00:09:59.989 --> 00:10:03.738
Or at least, you're gonna
tackle it the next sprint, and

154
00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:08.253
you have it scheduled, it's not
just gonna languish in the backlog,

155
00:10:08.253 --> 00:10:10.566
that's how you can chip away at it.

156
00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:15.379
But I think the reality is, accessibility
often is fixed long after something is

157
00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:19.079
launched, cuz people go,
dang, I didn't know [LAUGH].

158
00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:21.198
So sometimes that's what
you'll be dealing with and

159
00:10:21.198 --> 00:10:24.458
it's kind of the same process though, you
still have to break it down into parts.

160
00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:28.280
You still have to schedule it, figure
out what the scope and estimates are,

161
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:28.826
all that.

162
00:10:30.086 --> 00:10:34.506
So to help you prioritize some
heuristics that I would think about for

163
00:10:34.506 --> 00:10:39.242
prioritization include,
what's the accessibility impact of issues.

164
00:10:39.242 --> 00:10:44.091
You can find all kinds of little
tweaky issues, but some of them might

165
00:10:44.091 --> 00:10:48.520
be WCAG AAA and, or maybe they're
kind of your personal bias or

166
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.302
your personal thought of
how something should work.

167
00:10:52.302 --> 00:10:54.837
Really consider how blocking is this?

168
00:10:54.837 --> 00:10:58.613
Can someone complete this if they
really can't use a mouse and

169
00:10:58.613 --> 00:11:01.820
their focus dial is lost,
are they going to be lost?

170
00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:08.006
Yeah, probably, that happens to be,
I think, a level A criterion in WCAG.

171
00:11:08.006 --> 00:11:09.854
So, yeah, what's the impact?

172
00:11:09.854 --> 00:11:14.373
If there is a WCAG criterion for
web content accessibility guidelines,

173
00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:17.757
there's three levels, level A, AA, AAA.

174
00:11:17.757 --> 00:11:20.757
Level A is absolutely yes,
you must meet it.

175
00:11:20.757 --> 00:11:23.017
AA is also absolutely yes, usually.

176
00:11:23.017 --> 00:11:30.334
AAA is, well, if you can meet that great,
but usually AA is what we're aiming for.

177
00:11:30.334 --> 00:11:35.254
So that can help you kind of gauge how
that works and test with users too,

178
00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:39.849
if you think someone is blocking,
if you can have someone test it,

179
00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:43.067
who knows, that's really great input also.

180
00:11:43.067 --> 00:11:47.695
Analytics and metrics, so
we can't track screen reader users for

181
00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:52.819
privacy reasons, but we do have traffic
metrics that we can see usually,

182
00:11:52.819 --> 00:11:55.892
are these core user
flows that these are on?

183
00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:59.831
How much traffic talking about here
cuz that could be really impactful?

184
00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:04.327
If people can't check out,
they can't buy a mortgage or whatever,

185
00:12:04.327 --> 00:12:09.755
that's a problem, you're gonna lose
a sale, you're gonna lose some business,

186
00:12:09.755 --> 00:12:15.623
that is what Target got sued for,
their checkout button was not accessible.

187
00:12:15.623 --> 00:12:20.950
And so, they've changed their culture
now as a result, which is really cool.

188
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.768
But which browsers and platforms?

189
00:12:23.768 --> 00:12:25.407
Are there any areas that need more help?

190
00:12:25.407 --> 00:12:29.086
I was saying,
do you need more design help?

191
00:12:29.086 --> 00:12:32.111
And then the cost of not doing it,
I'm not an MBA, but

192
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:36.156
I could probably break it down into
coming up with some scary estimate.

193
00:12:36.156 --> 00:12:41.113
[LAUGH] Or sorry, not scary, a helpful
estimate of the cost of not doing it,

194
00:12:41.113 --> 00:12:43.486
that's what you could make scary.

195
00:12:43.486 --> 00:12:47.237
Like, hey, if we do this, these
are the benefits, if we don't do this,

196
00:12:47.237 --> 00:12:48.761
here's the scary estimate.

197
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:53.937
But we'll talk a lot more about
organizational skill building a little

198
00:12:53.937 --> 00:12:55.061
bit later.

199
00:12:55.061 --> 00:13:00.739
So accessibility personas,
especially in the design phase planning,

200
00:13:00.739 --> 00:13:03.445
thinking about who our users are.

201
00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:07.289
This is one of the earliest times that
people with disabilities are marginalized

202
00:13:07.289 --> 00:13:08.259
out of the process.

203
00:13:08.259 --> 00:13:10.021
And there's no thought or

204
00:13:10.021 --> 00:13:14.433
care into how someone would use
a screen reader or use a keyboard.

205
00:13:14.433 --> 00:13:18.922
And so, sometimes that can be part of
your planning phase, your design phase,

206
00:13:18.922 --> 00:13:21.200
to think about, how is this gonna work?

207
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.524
What would our customer be doing,
if we're a bank?

208
00:13:25.524 --> 00:13:27.637
Yeah, blind people have bank accounts.

209
00:13:27.637 --> 00:13:28.739
Blind people do all kinds of things.

210
00:13:28.739 --> 00:13:34.907
So including your customers in
accessibility personas can be helpful.

211
00:13:34.907 --> 00:13:38.731
And while personas are not real people,
they do represent your users,

212
00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:41.549
people using your product,
buying your services.

213
00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:47.856
So I have some examples, because there
is a lot of really great expertise

214
00:13:47.856 --> 00:13:51.449
that's been shared over
the last couple of decades.

215
00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:55.903
There's some from the UK Government
Digital Service, from Stanford,

216
00:13:55.903 --> 00:14:01.393
book called A Web for Everyone that weaves
personas throughout, that's really great.

217
00:14:01.393 --> 00:14:07.027
I found these personas on the Figma
community, part of the Figma as well.

218
00:14:07.027 --> 00:14:10.135
And I have the cover of that on the slide,
but

219
00:14:10.135 --> 00:14:13.423
there's a whole series
of personas in there.

220
00:14:13.423 --> 00:14:17.818
So you could see kind of how do people
approach that, I think we can benefit from

221
00:14:17.818 --> 00:14:22.313
the wisdom that's been shared by
people in the Accessibility community.

222
00:14:22.313 --> 00:14:25.412
So you can share that with your
design partners and colleagues.
