00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.746
Big picture questions when you're
considering picking a library or

2
00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:07.190
framework, like what's
the lifespan of your project?

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.171
Is this gonna have to live forever,

4
00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:12.550
are you gonna need something
really robust in years to come?

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.189
Or is this a smaller experiment where
maybe you can live on the bleeding edge

6
00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.130
a little bit more?

7
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.098
Yeah, what's the lifespan, what's
the roadmap for the library that we're

8
00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:28.514
evaluating, what's their funding model,
were they just acquired?

9
00:00:28.514 --> 00:00:32.595
Gatsby was just acquired by Netlify and
nobody knows what's gonna happen with it,

10
00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.874
maybe not the best choice right now.

11
00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:38.664
Sorry, sorry, people, still love you.

12
00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:42.156
But think about that, what's the state of
it, has it been around for a while but

13
00:00:42.156 --> 00:00:43.777
it's kind of dying?

14
00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:48.570
Do an honest assessment of that, cuz there
are some risks associated with picking

15
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.507
a library that's on its way out,
and that is hard to predict.

16
00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:56.536
I mean people have been thinking React's
gonna go down and it's still super solid,

17
00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:59.784
it's partly cuz I think a lot of
us love it, but some people don't.

18
00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:03.642
So these are all pretty
subjective questions.

19
00:01:03.642 --> 00:01:07.535
But in terms of business we
have to think about longevity,

20
00:01:07.535 --> 00:01:10.243
what our goals are, what are the risks.

21
00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:15.995
Who's maintaining this library, what's the
state of their issue tracker code base?

22
00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:19.595
Can you do a partnership,
you're a big enterprise,

23
00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:23.840
can you pay those open source
people to fast track your issues?

24
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.361
I've seen that kinda thing happen,
partnerships,

25
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:30.403
there's stuff like that with axe-core, so
you can fast track getting your issues.

26
00:01:30.403 --> 00:01:34.175
Microsoft, and axe-core, and
Deque, they work together,

27
00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:37.176
that's how Accessibility Insights
came about.

28
00:01:37.176 --> 00:01:39.964
So these are all things, as a tech lead or

29
00:01:39.964 --> 00:01:44.732
in leadership we should be thinking
about these kinds of questions.

30
00:01:44.732 --> 00:01:45.576
And then look for

31
00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:49.141
accessibility APIs within the framework
to help make your decision.

32
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:55.532
React has refs, there's use ID,
all the testing libraries and things.

33
00:01:55.532 --> 00:02:02.022
Vue has template refs, Ember has
somewhat of an accessibility culture.

34
00:02:02.022 --> 00:02:05.450
Angular, I think you're kinda
more on your own, unfortunately.
