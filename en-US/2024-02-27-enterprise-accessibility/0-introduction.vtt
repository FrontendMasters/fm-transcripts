00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.190
Hello everyone, I am here to talk to
you about enterprise accessibility.

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.161
I'm your instructor, Marcy Sutton Todd,
and I'm really thrilled to tell you

3
00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:14.148
everything I know about more advanced
levels of accessibility for tech leads.

4
00:00:14.148 --> 00:00:19.062
Really anyone who's at a more senior level
who wants to know how to incorporate

5
00:00:19.062 --> 00:00:22.867
accessibility at organizations
of medium to larger sizes.

6
00:00:24.177 --> 00:00:29.143
So we have our materials available on
GitHub, I've shared them in the chat, you

7
00:00:29.143 --> 00:00:34.708
can find them on my GitHub, Marcy Sutton,
Frontend Masters Enterprise Accessibility.

8
00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:37.599
It's sort of optional,
if you want to check these out and

9
00:00:37.599 --> 00:00:39.177
build them locally, you can.

10
00:00:39.177 --> 00:00:41.423
The exercises are all in there.

11
00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:44.979
So let's take a little
tour of our setup today.

12
00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.739
So here we are in GitHub.

13
00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.359
I have this cloned locally
in my text editor VS code.

14
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.039
So I'll be jumping back and forth
between the browser and the text editor.

15
00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.416
And most of the time we'll be
looking at the site in the browser.

16
00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.094
So let's dive in.

17
00:01:04.094 --> 00:01:07.362
Just to start, I'll tell you
a little bit about who I am and

18
00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:08.716
how did I get into this.

19
00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:12.107
So, I'm Marcy,
I started as a web developer and

20
00:01:12.107 --> 00:01:16.991
really found accessibility mattered to me,
once I learned about it,

21
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:21.994
I met people with disabilities on
the job and it changed my whole world.

22
00:01:21.994 --> 00:01:27.693
And so, my hope for you in this course, if
you haven't already gotten that spark and

23
00:01:27.693 --> 00:01:32.126
that light bulb of, whoa,
accessibility is really important.

24
00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:36.646
I hope to open that door for you today,
especially as tech leads and

25
00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:39.299
people in influential roles.

26
00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.354
You can turn other coworkers and
colleagues into champions and

27
00:01:43.354 --> 00:01:44.432
make an impact.

28
00:01:44.432 --> 00:01:47.435
It's like that's what today is all about,

29
00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:52.224
is seeing what opportunities we can
find to improve accessibility and

30
00:01:52.224 --> 00:01:57.092
really pushing the needle wherever
we can in a sustainable manner, but

31
00:01:57.092 --> 00:02:00.967
we can make a difference,
especially as tech leads.

32
00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:04.766
So let's talk about what things
do you need to watch out for,

33
00:02:04.766 --> 00:02:08.207
what types of tools and
techniques will come in handy.

34
00:02:09.367 --> 00:02:12.427
So we have a lot to cover today,
let's dive in.

35
00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:17.198
So, we're gonna go through all kinds of
things, all kinds of reasons to care about

36
00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:20.079
accessibility, how to
convince stakeholders.

37
00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.933
Cuz there's different persuasive
arguments you could make depending on

38
00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:29.169
who you're talking to or
what jobs you're trying to complete.

39
00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.049
We'll get into more
tactical things as well and

40
00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.428
we'll get pretty technical later on.

41
00:02:34.428 --> 00:02:39.036
But I think we can break accessibility
down into smaller parts and

42
00:02:39.036 --> 00:02:42.287
I wanna start with
minimum viable products.

43
00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:46.810
So MVPs, which you may or
may not work in an agile life cycle or

44
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.866
that style of working, but
I think there are lessons that we can take

45
00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:58.017
from the minimum viable product
concept to apply to accessibility.

46
00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:01.256
We'll dig into accessible user interfaces,

47
00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:06.915
what makes an accessible user interface
at least, as much as we can fit in today.

48
00:03:08.585 --> 00:03:13.379
We'll talk about screen readers and Aria,
and what goes into accessible names,

49
00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:18.175
and how to make user interfaces that work
with assistive technologies like screen

50
00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:21.390
readers, and
we'll get really technical with that.

51
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.163
We'll dive into accessibility
in JavaScript applications,

52
00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:29.269
which has been a passion topic of mine for
a long time,

53
00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.340
because there are so many
JavaScript-heavy applications out there.

54
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.066
Many of them don't have accessibility
built into them, or they have kind of

55
00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:42.456
mixed levels of it, and I've always seen
that as an opportunity for improvement.

56
00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:46.646
So it's like, well, people are building
it, let's make those accessible.

57
00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:51.916
So we'll talk about some unique aspects
of accessibility and JavaScript apps.

58
00:03:51.916 --> 00:03:56.048
We'll look at test automation for
accessibility, kind of where

59
00:03:56.048 --> 00:04:01.019
accessibility can slot into your different
test suites and different tools.

60
00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:05.826
And then we'll get more, I guess, soft
skills is how we describe this sometimes,

61
00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:08.205
but organizational skill building.

62
00:04:08.205 --> 00:04:10.157
So who do you have to convince?

63
00:04:10.157 --> 00:04:13.125
What are we really doing this for, also?

64
00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:18.610
To put an emphasis on the work
that we do with accessibility for

65
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.308
the rights of people with disabilities.

66
00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:24.281
And then we'll wrap up for the day.

67
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.645
So, I'm excited, and
thanks for being here.
