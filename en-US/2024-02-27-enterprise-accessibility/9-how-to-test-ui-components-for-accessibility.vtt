WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.990
All right, so
let's test some UI components.

2
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.525
Here are the steps,
since I made made you all wait, [LAUGH].

3
00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.623
We saw how to use the keyboard
to tab through a page,

4
00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:12.710
that's always the first thing that I do.

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.181
And since we talked about click events and
wrapper elements,

6
00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:20.583
I wanna call out the not everything has
to be interactive for screen reader.

7
00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:25.273
That's kind of a common pitfall or
misconception.

8
00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:28.893
I'll see people who are like, really,
I just learned about accessibility.

9
00:00:28.893 --> 00:00:33.036
I'm gonna put tabindex on everything
cuz they don't quite understand how

10
00:00:33.036 --> 00:00:36.993
screen readers work, screen readers
have other ways to navigate.

11
00:00:36.993 --> 00:00:41.355
Tab key is not the only way, you can
navigate by headings, you can navigate to

12
00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:46.702
the next list, the next table, and
those don't have to have tabindex on them.

13
00:00:46.702 --> 00:00:49.342
It's only for things that are interactive.

14
00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:53.338
Things that like a mouse user and a
keyboard user should be able to reach and

15
00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:54.522
operate.

16
00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:56.132
Can you see where you are?

17
00:00:56.132 --> 00:00:58.022
Do you have a focus outline?

18
00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:02.302
For compound widgets like date picker,
tab switchers,

19
00:01:02.302 --> 00:01:07.550
some more like desktop style
menus that have full aria roles.

20
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.580
Those are use cases for the arrow keys.

21
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.090
We wanna run a browser extension
like Axe or Accessibility Insights.

22
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.570
We'll run some in a second.

23
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.946
And test the heading structure, tools I
like are the Web Developer toolbar, and

24
00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:24.070
one I just learned about
called the headings map.

25
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.420
I need to add it to this, it's great.

26
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.530
And you could debug elements,
I usually go between Axe and the DevTools.

27
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.010
We want to zoom in.

28
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.599
So, I mean, it's straight up,
just like Command Plus or Control Plus,

29
00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.677
minus zoom in to at least 200%.

30
00:01:40.677 --> 00:01:43.567
See that everything
reflows into one column.

31
00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:47.136
That is a WCAG success criterion,
it's called reflow.

32
00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:50.087
Make sure your components are not broken.

33
00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:53.014
You don't wanna have to
horizontally scroll or

34
00:01:53.014 --> 00:01:55.607
have half of a component be off-screen.

35
00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:59.407
If I click here and
my toast is invisible, what happens then?

36
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.455
Yeah, sound like you knew all
about reflow now, [LAUGH].

37
00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:09.297
Further down the list, much further down
the list, I have tests with a screen

38
00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:14.630
reader like VoiceOver or NVDA, that can
be a bit advanced with a learning curve.

39
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.838
But we have some cheat sheets
that are very helpful for

40
00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:21.057
that more in our accessible naming and
aria section.

41
00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:24.811
And then, check for
that animation in motion autoplaying,

42
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:27.974
it kind of jumps out at you
once you know to look for,

43
00:02:27.974 --> 00:02:32.852
it's like whoa this is moving, I thought
I had reduced motion on all the time.

44
00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:35.537
Go check, yap that's not responding, so

45
00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:41.254
you know that's an issue that is also
multiple success criteria around that one.

46
00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:47.424
And then make note of any missing media
for any video, audio with spoken word.

47
00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:51.520
We need captions and transcripts, so
that our deaf colleagues and users and

48
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.872
friends can participate cuz it's pretty
exclusionary to not have the ability to

49
00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:58.454
follow along when you can't hear.

50
00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:02.891
So sometimes, it might have been
missed in the content strategy or

51
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.457
something, if you if you
notice that speak up because

52
00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:11.309
it's better to speak up then just let
that go and never get those assets.

53
00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:15.976
All right, so let's do some testing and
our goal, where this is some manual steps,

54
00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:19.196
we wanna bake as much of this
into the code as possible, and

55
00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:21.688
we'll discuss later on automation.

56
00:03:21.688 --> 00:03:28.168
But kind of our first thing that we
can do is evaluate with this workflow.

57
00:03:28.168 --> 00:03:30.418
So let's go do some testing.

58
00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:33.078
I'll actually go back over to Stripe and
do this.

59
00:03:33.078 --> 00:03:34.686
So we tested with the keyboard.

60
00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:40.833
Let's run axe DevTools, which is a free
browser extension for Chrome and Firefox.

61
00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:45.763
There's kind of these paid parts for
guided testing.

62
00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:49.033
They have evolved these tools over time,
they're really great.

63
00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:53.215
But the free scan all of
my page thing is so solid,

64
00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:56.863
it's what I call my daily driver tool.

65
00:03:56.863 --> 00:03:59.703
I use it every day, pretty much.

66
00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:02.308
So I ran the page as rendered.

67
00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:06.018
So it's not gonna test that open mega
menu, it's not gonna test modals.

68
00:04:07.028 --> 00:04:12.068
They ignore stuff that's hidden on purpose
cuz it's not in a state that's ready.

69
00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:15.518
So you wanna run it
again with those states.

70
00:04:15.518 --> 00:04:20.129
But this returned color contrast issues,
and I'm gonna go over here and

71
00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.943
see, so
there's best practices are turned off.

72
00:04:23.943 --> 00:04:27.364
If I turn that on,
they have a way more issues, but

73
00:04:27.364 --> 00:04:30.293
best practices are not legally binding.

74
00:04:30.293 --> 00:04:34.308
There are things that we wanna fix,
but the violations are like,

75
00:04:34.308 --> 00:04:38.104
if you're focused on compliance,
do the violations first.

76
00:04:38.104 --> 00:04:41.784
It also tells you what
standard they're meeting or

77
00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:46.415
aiming to help you with and
that's WCAG 2.1 AA.

78
00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:51.393
There's also in here, so we have best
practices, there's no guided issues

79
00:04:51.393 --> 00:04:55.765
being returned, but Axe does have
this concept of needs review.

80
00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:59.872
I used to work on this tool,
that's why I know so much about it.

81
00:04:59.872 --> 00:05:04.569
And so, yeah, they might have changed
the way that needs review works,

82
00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.142
but a good example historically was
the text colors over gradients.

83
00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:11.407
They would just like,
if there's a background image,

84
00:05:11.407 --> 00:05:13.522
it just goes straight into needs review.

85
00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:15.784
I think those might be under
the guided issues now,

86
00:05:15.784 --> 00:05:18.262
which is it might be in a totally
different part of this.

87
00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:21.991
But you're at least gonna get
things that are actionable.

88
00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:28.101
I can hit Highlight to see where it
is on the screen, so that's helpful.

89
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:31.135
I can also go down here to this
Inspect element button and

90
00:05:31.135 --> 00:05:34.271
hop over to the DevTools
element inspector.

91
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.190
And that often, for color contrast,
I can go over here and

92
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.003
click on this little color picker.

93
00:05:39.003 --> 00:05:44.920
And in many cases, not all, it will
give me this contrast ratio picker,

94
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:50.160
so I can actually drag around,
so it's a blue color over white.

95
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.180
So if I make it slightly darker,
I guess it, did it meet?

96
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.385
Was it like just barely not meeting too?

97
00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:03.204
&gt;&gt; 4.5, and you're at 4.4.

98
00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:06.430
&gt;&gt; It was 4.44 when the expected ratio for

99
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.893
that font size is 4.5 to 1,
that's so close.

100
00:06:10.893 --> 00:06:15.695
So for that one, I could probably drag it,
fiddle it, change it slightly,

101
00:06:15.695 --> 00:06:17.063
and no one will know.

102
00:06:17.063 --> 00:06:20.113
[LAUGH] I could probably get
away with that in this case.

103
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.760
But sometimes it's too different
to be able to do that.

104
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.330
So you can go through these results and
fix all of these, fix as many as you can.

105
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.820
Run this as often as you can.

106
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.370
You'll find all kinds of things that
you missed and weren't aware of.

107
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.560
So this is essential.

108
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.868
There's also Accessibility Insights,

109
00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:46.675
the FastPass runs axe-core as well,
so it'll be really similar.

110
00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:50.232
The Ad hoc tools are totally
worth checking out,

111
00:06:50.232 --> 00:06:55.285
I can turn on headings and it will
show me what the heading levels are.

112
00:06:57.015 --> 00:07:02.791
So the last one I'll show you is
the Web Developer Extension under,

113
00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:04.525
say, blue by that.

114
00:07:04.525 --> 00:07:08.705
So Web Developer Information,
View Document Outline,

115
00:07:08.705 --> 00:07:11.845
will give me this overall picture.

116
00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:14.895
Everything's in H1.

117
00:07:14.895 --> 00:07:17.685
Nothing's important when
everything's important.

118
00:07:17.685 --> 00:07:19.285
So there's no hierarchy here.

119
00:07:21.114 --> 00:07:25.527
Yeah, the practice for headings is there
should be 1, H1 and then everything kind

120
00:07:25.527 --> 00:07:30.144
of flows under that, sometimes It's really
hard to not have headings before your H1.

121
00:07:30.144 --> 00:07:34.159
That's difficult and hard to avoid,
but in general we wanna try and

122
00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:38.880
create a content hierarchy like an outline
in Word or Google Docs when you tab and

123
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.621
like have an indentation and icons and
that's what we can do with our headings.

124
00:07:43.621 --> 00:07:48.931
So at least there's some flow to it,
that makes sense.

125
00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:50.921
There's some H2s.

126
00:07:52.391 --> 00:07:54.860
Nearly everything here is an H1, so

127
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.181
this tells me that they did
not test their heading levels.

128
00:07:59.181 --> 00:08:03.427
It's just hard to tell what's the most
important thing when everything's the same

129
00:08:03.427 --> 00:08:04.878
importance.

130
00:08:04.878 --> 00:08:06.933
&gt;&gt; Surprise that got by the SEO people.

131
00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:10.288
[LAUGH] I feel like the SEO people
wouldn't like that either, [LAUGH].

132
00:08:10.288 --> 00:08:11.438
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean things get missed.

133
00:08:11.438 --> 00:08:17.288
So that's why we need this regular
process somewhere along the way.

134
00:08:18.918 --> 00:08:20.328
So, we looked at zooming.

135
00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:25.238
We're gonna look at screen readers in the
next section, we've even seen some motion

136
00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:29.824
and that could be targeted with CSS kind
of depending on how that motion is done.

137
00:08:29.824 --> 00:08:34.671
If it's done with JavaScript, you can
target it with JavaScript matchMedia, or

138
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:38.535
you can use CSS media queries and
turn motion off, and so, yeah,

139
00:08:38.535 --> 00:08:40.454
that's kind of my basic steps.

140
00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:44.939
If you did the keyboard part and
the browser extensions and zoom in,

141
00:08:44.939 --> 00:08:47.114
you could fix a lot of stuff.

142
00:08:47.114 --> 00:08:51.614
I bet that list of 1100 issues
would have been a fraction of that.

143
00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:56.302
If we just do this regularly, cuz there's
so many easy wins that we could do and

144
00:08:56.302 --> 00:09:01.693
it feels so good to cross stuff off lists,
I gotta tell you, like it's satisfying.

145
00:09:01.693 --> 00:09:05.159
When you have all those results and you
hit re-run scan and you see it drop down,

146
00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:07.633
you're like, I gotta get those.

147
00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:09.974
If you can get your team
fired up about that,

148
00:09:09.974 --> 00:09:13.663
you're gonna smash some accessibility
bugs, and that feels good.

149
00:09:14.683 --> 00:09:16.342
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we crossed off 40 or

150
00:09:16.342 --> 00:09:20.917
50 at a time by just adding alt text to
the search results and stuff like that.

151
00:09:22.398 --> 00:09:25.001
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and sometimes that's in
a template like your landmarks.

152
00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:26.844
You might have multiple failures for

153
00:09:26.844 --> 00:09:29.226
something that are tied
to a single component.

154
00:09:29.226 --> 00:09:34.722
So you can watch that dramatically drop
because you targeted it at the source,

155
00:09:34.722 --> 00:09:39.717
like a component that gets reused,
if you can fix it there, then you can

156
00:09:39.717 --> 00:09:44.902
stand back and watch those results
come down, those failures come down.

157
00:09:44.902 --> 00:09:46.542
Is there a question?

158
00:09:48.502 --> 00:09:52.492
&gt;&gt; Is it okay to use H1s as
headings within sections?

159
00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:57.732
I've seen it both ways,
only one per page versus one per section.

160
00:09:57.732 --> 00:09:58.392
&gt;&gt; Great question.

161
00:09:58.392 --> 00:10:03.374
So, there was a, for a while they're
a movement, I don't know if it ever became

162
00:10:03.374 --> 00:10:07.550
a standard or anything, but
to allow you to have more than 1,H1,

163
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:12.821
where you could have excerpts and
they're supposed to be more portable.

164
00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:16.171
Unfortunately, they were never really
implemented for assistive technology.

165
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:20.770
So, for accessibility purposes,
we say only 1, H1.

166
00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.476
And you try to go in order,
H1, H2, H3, H4.

167
00:10:24.476 --> 00:10:28.542
And then once you've met H4,
you can kind of skip around, but

168
00:10:28.542 --> 00:10:33.346
I would say having headings at all,
that's gonna be the most helpful.

169
00:10:33.346 --> 00:10:37.711
Having some sort of a structure,
like all H1s that,

170
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:41.794
I've heard both sides
from screen reader users.

171
00:10:41.794 --> 00:10:45.124
Some people are really bothered by it and
blocked by it.

172
00:10:45.124 --> 00:10:50.004
For other people, it's not as big of
an issue, but I think headings are,

173
00:10:50.004 --> 00:10:56.094
they're pretty foundational in WCAG,
like the info and relationships criterion.

174
00:10:56.094 --> 00:10:59.954
I think there's some others that really
target this type of semantic structure.

175
00:10:59.954 --> 00:11:04.852
So, if you're looking for compliance,
it is something you need to do.

176
00:11:04.852 --> 00:11:10.652
And the more than 1, H1 thing was just
never really, that ship never sailed.

177
00:11:12.342 --> 00:11:15.532
So, yeah, unfortunately,
we haven't been able to do that.

178
00:11:15.532 --> 00:11:21.132
But that's why I mentioned that approach
with react and context, you might be able

179
00:11:21.132 --> 00:11:26.572
to use some tooling to help you pick the
right heading level in a design system or,

180
00:11:26.572 --> 00:11:31.374
I don't know, a web application
with some innovation or creativity.
