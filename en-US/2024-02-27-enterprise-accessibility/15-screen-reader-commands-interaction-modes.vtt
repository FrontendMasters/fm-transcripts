00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.601
The screen reader modes are significant,
like if you're testing,

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:07.022
creating interactive widgets and
you're not testing on Windows,

3
00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:10.340
you could be missing stuff that
is just straight up broken.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.171
I've done it.
I've been like, whoa,

5
00:00:12.171 --> 00:00:14.850
this works awesome on VoiceOver.

6
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.730
And then I go over to Windows,
wah, wah, it doesn't work.

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.317
So it's something to watch out for.

8
00:00:20.317 --> 00:00:23.867
So let's fire this up.

9
00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:28.972
We're actually going to navigate a page,
and then our next example,

10
00:00:28.972 --> 00:00:33.484
we're gonna build in something
that works with these modes.

11
00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:37.328
So kind of a brief overview
is that Windows screen

12
00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:40.543
readers have interaction modes.

13
00:00:40.543 --> 00:00:43.880
Instead of just one mode all the time,
like VoiceOver,

14
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.723
they do things with key commands
that are very hard to remember.

15
00:00:48.813 --> 00:00:53.541
NVDA and JAWS have simpler key commands
that function because they know

16
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:55.333
what mode you're in.

17
00:00:55.333 --> 00:01:00.493
Like in this example, if I was on Windows,
I could hit the H key to go from

18
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:06.741
the heading to heading through headings
when I'm in document mode or browse mode.

19
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:09.461
That's kind of the default of,
I'm reading.

20
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:13.602
But what happens if you want
to type an H into an input,

21
00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:16.006
or a content editable region?

22
00:01:16.006 --> 00:01:19.765
You want that H to go through
to the browser so it'll type it.

23
00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:23.382
So, in this field,
if I type H on Windows and NVDA,

24
00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:29.958
the mode will actually change when I focus
in that field, it'll do it automatically.

25
00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.508
I don't have to do anything.

26
00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.848
Just know that the mode is changing.

27
00:01:33.848 --> 00:01:36.728
So let's actually go over to NVDA.

28
00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:39.843
So how I launch it, I'm on a Mac,
I have it installed.

29
00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:45.886
I'm just gonna do command space,
NVDA, hit Enter.

30
00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:51.381
There it is [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Unknown.

31
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:53.028
&gt;&gt; Okay, hello, NVDA.

32
00:01:53.028 --> 00:01:54.958
So I'm gonna go back to
the page we were just on.

33
00:01:56.428 --> 00:02:02.715
&gt;&gt; Screen slideshow exercise,
web accessibility, V2 profile one.

34
00:02:02.715 --> 00:02:06.405
Here are some tips and commands for
using various screen readers.

35
00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.195
A form example.

36
00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:10.907
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
at any time in either VoiceOver or NVDA,

37
00:02:10.907 --> 00:02:14.285
I can hit the control key on
a Mac to get it to stop reading.

38
00:02:14.285 --> 00:02:15.425
Kind of helpful.

39
00:02:15.425 --> 00:02:17.815
So I'm gonna hit the H key
to go through the headings.

40
00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:22.593
&gt;&gt; Main landmark screen reader commands
and interaction modes heading level one.

41
00:02:22.593 --> 00:02:25.521
Windows screen reader
interaction modes permalink for

42
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:27.269
this section heading level two.

43
00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.013
A form example heading level three.

44
00:02:30.013 --> 00:02:33.458
Use role equals application with
extreme caution permalink for

45
00:02:33.458 --> 00:02:35.251
this section heading level two.

46
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.818
&gt;&gt; So you see,
you just keep hanging H in browse mode,

47
00:02:37.818 --> 00:02:40.287
it will just keep going
through those headings.

48
00:02:40.287 --> 00:02:43.277
When we go back to a form input.

49
00:02:43.277 --> 00:02:45.618
&gt;&gt; Document, main landmark.

50
00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:49.200
First name added
Rainier McCheddarton blank.

51
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.590
&gt;&gt; That's my dog's name by the way,
Rainier McCheddarton.

52
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.211
I always try to put his name
into every code base I work on.

53
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:59.234
But did you hear that sound,
like if I go out of this again?

54
00:02:59.234 --> 00:03:00.920
&gt;&gt; Interaction modes.

55
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.253
Open first name edit
Rainier McCheddarton blank.

56
00:03:04.253 --> 00:03:06.883
&gt;&gt; So it kind of made a beep
when it went into browse mode.

57
00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:09.622
And then when I went into forms mode or
focus mode,

58
00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:13.173
it makes that kind of like cash
register sound, I call it.

59
00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:17.565
Those sound effects, it's kind of a beep
when you go into document mode and

60
00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:21.537
a cash register sound as I like to
call it when you go into forms mode or

61
00:03:21.537 --> 00:03:23.018
also called focus mode.

62
00:03:23.018 --> 00:03:27.421
Those sounds tell a user that they're
going in and out of these modes.

63
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:29.377
You can also manually change the mode.

64
00:03:29.377 --> 00:03:32.634
If I accidentally get
into the wrong thing or

65
00:03:32.634 --> 00:03:38.531
a widget isn't working the way I expected,
as a user I could go NVDA plus space,

66
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.547
which this is where you might want
to map your keys to have caps lock,

67
00:03:43.547 --> 00:03:48.943
do the thing, I actually don't think
I have it even mapped on here, so.

68
00:03:51.553 --> 00:03:54.439
Yeah, I might not be able to
manually do that right now.

69
00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.876
So, when I'm at home and
I have my hardware keyboard,

70
00:03:57.876 --> 00:04:00.659
I have an insert key and
I can easily do that.

71
00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:04.507
So those modes are irrelevant.

72
00:04:04.507 --> 00:04:08.657
And we can change what mode it's
going into by what role things are.

73
00:04:08.657 --> 00:04:12.253
So like input, did it automatically.

74
00:04:12.253 --> 00:04:13.865
If I'm on a paragraph or a div or

75
00:04:13.865 --> 00:04:16.846
something, it's just
automatically going to browse.

76
00:04:16.846 --> 00:04:18.237
It'll be in document mode.

77
00:04:19.307 --> 00:04:20.677
&gt;&gt; In a field screen reader.

78
00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:24.950
&gt;&gt; So let's pause that for a second.

79
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.368
So, there is a way to have the browser
go automatically into focus mode,

80
00:04:31.368 --> 00:04:35.261
which I have found
a necessary on occasion,

81
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:39.472
but I can't give you like
a big enough caution,

82
00:04:39.472 --> 00:04:43.805
[LAUGH] be very careful with this,
it does exist.

83
00:04:43.805 --> 00:04:48.671
So there's a role called application,
and it will automatically put anything

84
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:53.065
inside of that element with that
role on it into focus mode.

85
00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:57.004
So if you're doing like
a custom widget that's like

86
00:04:57.004 --> 00:05:00.765
it just won't work without this role.

87
00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:01.896
Maybe you could add it.

88
00:05:01.896 --> 00:05:05.235
I would recommend putting it behind
like an edit mode or something so

89
00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:08.750
it's not there all the time because
what happens, if everything's in

90
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.836
application mode, I can't navigate
by headings anymore automatically.

91
00:05:12.836 --> 00:05:16.913
I mean, I could manually go back to
document mode with that key as a user, but

92
00:05:16.913 --> 00:05:19.336
we wanna make this as
seamless as possible.

93
00:05:19.336 --> 00:05:22.600
And anytime we take that functionality
away, we have to replace it.

94
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.541
So we don't really wanna have to write
keyboard shortcuts for every feature in

95
00:05:26.541 --> 00:05:30.495
the screen reader, just so that we could
have this widget work the way we want.

96
00:05:30.495 --> 00:05:34.625
That would be misguided, I think.

97
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:40.863
There's an article in here by Marco Zija
about how to use the application role.

98
00:05:40.863 --> 00:05:43.963
What you definitely don't want to
do is just slap it on the document.

99
00:05:43.963 --> 00:05:47.136
I like up on the HTML or
body tag, I guess, body tag.

100
00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:50.330
You don't want to make whole pages,
roles of applications.

101
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.180
I mean, maybe Google Drive does that,
something that's really long lived

102
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.046
web application where they
really do backfill everything,

103
00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:01.952
all of those features that they took away.

104
00:06:01.952 --> 00:06:05.188
That's ambitious and
maybe Google can do that.

105
00:06:05.188 --> 00:06:07.566
But they're probably testing
a lot with users too.

106
00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:10.412
So, you know, it exists.

107
00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:11.275
Just be careful with it.
