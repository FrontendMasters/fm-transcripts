1
00:00:00.355 --> 00:00:02.966
All right, Inclusive Hiring &amp; Workplaces.

2
00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:07.954
So we've talked a lot about what we
can do as developers to make things

3
00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:09.335
more accessible.

4
00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:13.312
There's a bit of a bias in a lot
of what we're talking about and

5
00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.468
the tooling in how we do our jobs.

6
00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:19.486
And I just wanted to carve-out
some time to say that this is

7
00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:24.328
accessibility is about working with
people with disabilities also.

8
00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:26.144
We're not like saviors here.

9
00:00:26.144 --> 00:00:28.612
This isn't about charity or something.

10
00:00:28.612 --> 00:00:30.275
And we'll talk about
that more in a second.

11
00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:34.692
But there's a little bit of a sad
irony that we're talking a lot about

12
00:00:34.692 --> 00:00:35.912
accessibility and

13
00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:40.655
many of the platforms that we use to
do our work are totally inaccessible.

14
00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:44.963
So, fortunately,
there are some organizations and

15
00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:48.417
some laws around accessible workplaces.

16
00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:51.281
I have an infographic here from PEAT, or

17
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:55.589
the Partnership on Employment and
Accessible Technology.

18
00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.477
And they just sort of like go into all
of the areas where levers could be

19
00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:05.721
pulled on making the workplace more
accessible throughout technology.

20
00:01:05.721 --> 00:01:10.218
So, government comes into it,
advocacy groups, employers have

21
00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:15.682
responsibilities here, technology
companies for the tooling that we put out,

22
00:01:15.682 --> 00:01:19.778
education and research, so
schools that have to teach it and

23
00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:24.308
have to be accessible themselves
to students with disabilities.

24
00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:26.109
So it's just kind of interesting,

25
00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.641
we're not on our own here
in thinking about this.

26
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:33.416
There's groups that care a lot
about accessible workplaces

27
00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:38.108
that we can lean on some of their
wisdom to learn about this.

28
00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:42.879
And do what you can about ensuring that
you don't have tools that are being used,

29
00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.573
like especially in hiring.

30
00:01:44.573 --> 00:01:48.197
Is your interview tooling
totally inaccessible,

31
00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:51.323
cuz that's the first barrier right there.

32
00:01:51.323 --> 00:01:57.715
There's barriers throughout the work
life cycle, but that first door,

33
00:01:57.715 --> 00:02:03.093
if you can't even apply for
a job, that's discrimination.

34
00:02:03.093 --> 00:02:05.349
Kind of a big word,
that's really what this is.

35
00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.557
So this isn't a statistics thing only,
this is like,

36
00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:12.418
people with disabilities are literally
shut out of the process.

37
00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:17.162
And so it's common but sometimes you're
in a place to do something about it.

38
00:02:17.162 --> 00:02:19.096
So here's a quick story.

39
00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:24.703
When I worked at a past company, I saw
some of our products that we were using,

40
00:02:24.703 --> 00:02:29.279
cloud services and things for
HR, like performance reviews,

41
00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:33.368
like our HR software,
it was easy to spot these issues.

42
00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:35.024
I mean, I was using it all the time.

43
00:02:35.024 --> 00:02:36.723
I was a manager at the time.

44
00:02:36.723 --> 00:02:40.420
And so I provided product feedback
to both of those companies.

45
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.737
Like, hey, here's a prioritized
list of issues for you.

46
00:02:44.737 --> 00:02:48.725
One of the companies was so eager to fix
that stuff that we got on a call and

47
00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:52.202
they were like, more, give us more,
please, we love this.

48
00:02:52.202 --> 00:02:53.085
Awesome.

49
00:02:53.085 --> 00:02:55.912
The other company, crickets.

50
00:02:55.912 --> 00:02:58.989
So sometimes you can make
a difference with this stuff,

51
00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.503
people are really into it.

52
00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:05.365
Sometimes it's just like throwing
your feedback into the garbage can,

53
00:03:05.365 --> 00:03:06.566
unfortunately.

54
00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:12.052
But you might be able to influence
procurement at your company if there's

55
00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:17.016
a more accessible alternative to
something, just be aware of it.

56
00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:22.233
It might be outside the scope of your
role, especially a big companies.

57
00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:27.167
But this kind of elephant in
the room with accessibility is like,

58
00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:31.024
we don't wanna just work
to make accessibility for

59
00:03:31.024 --> 00:03:35.250
people, we want true inclusion and
true civil rights.

60
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.229
That's where we wanna get to.

61
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.862
On that note,
centering people with disabilities.

62
00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:44.352
This goes beyond hiring.

63
00:03:44.352 --> 00:03:48.917
This is getting back to
product development also.

64
00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:52.600
So we wanna remember what this is about.

65
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.193
We don't wanna get caught up in just
like being accessibility technicians.

66
00:03:57.193 --> 00:04:04.117
So there is a phrase in accessibility,
nothing about us without us.

67
00:04:04.117 --> 00:04:08.046
We've been doing a lot of talking
about accessibility today, so

68
00:04:08.046 --> 00:04:11.770
it is a little bit ironic to me
that I'm saying this right now.

69
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.726
But I just wanna share this with you so
that we can try and

70
00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:20.371
open doorways in our work to
involve people with disabilities,

71
00:04:20.371 --> 00:04:23.741
to join our teams,
to consult with our teams.

72
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:26.683
We're gonna pay people for their time.

73
00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.726
There is a book here called
Nothing About Us Without Us,

74
00:04:29.726 --> 00:04:33.052
if you're curious about
the history of disability rights.

75
00:04:33.052 --> 00:04:35.359
It's a very rich history, and

76
00:04:35.359 --> 00:04:40.606
I'm pretty in awe of how hard people
have worked to gain their rights.

77
00:04:40.606 --> 00:04:44.492
A lot of our history in the US is
because of this activist history,

78
00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:45.914
it's pretty awesome.

79
00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:48.534
But it sucks that people had to do that.

80
00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:50.965
They had to really fight for that.

81
00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:54.250
And in some ways,
it's a lot easier for us on the web,

82
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.110
we can just redesign stuff and
rebuild stuff.

83
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.660
It's like we don't have to knock down,

84
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.618
we don't have to demolish a building to
make more accessible entrances to it.

85
00:05:04.618 --> 00:05:06.034
But there are some analogs.

86
00:05:06.034 --> 00:05:09.526
Depending on how
foundational the issues are,

87
00:05:09.526 --> 00:05:13.199
we might need to tear down the site and
start over.

88
00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.795
But with technology it
is slightly different.

89
00:05:17.795 --> 00:05:20.774
So yeah, we wanna advocate for
accessibility or

90
00:05:20.774 --> 00:05:24.780
people with disabilities to be
involved earlier in the process.

91
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.317
So one last thing on this is that there's
kind of a social media effect here that

92
00:05:29.317 --> 00:05:33.995
was pointed out to me years ago that
there's a difference between accessibility

93
00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:38.976
Twitter or the accessibility world and the
disability world or disability Twitter.

94
00:05:38.976 --> 00:05:41.111
Those are not the same.

95
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:44.940
And being a young,
eager accessibility person,

96
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.311
that was kind of the first
realization I had of that a lot of

97
00:05:49.311 --> 00:05:53.520
accessibility people are in
positions of privilege.

98
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.035
We kind of lose sight of what we're really
talking about here, no pun intended.

99
00:05:58.035 --> 00:06:01.813
So just, yeah, if you get the opportunity,
Twitter is not what it used to be.

100
00:06:01.813 --> 00:06:05.329
But disability Twitter is still on there.

101
00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:08.402
It's still a way that people
connect with each other.

102
00:06:08.402 --> 00:06:09.954
People are sharing their experiences.

103
00:06:09.954 --> 00:06:15.610
So we'd be really wise to listen cuz
people can tell us what frustrates them,

104
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.279
especially with that
accessibility statement.

105
00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:23.353
If they can tell you exactly what
frustrates them about your site,

106
00:06:23.353 --> 00:06:24.599
that is a real gift.
