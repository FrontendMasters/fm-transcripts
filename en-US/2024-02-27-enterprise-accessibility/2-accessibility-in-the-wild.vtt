1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.420
So let's look at some demos,
some examples.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.070
What are people doing with
accessibility out in the wild?

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.021
So I just picked a few
kind of like good or bad,

4
00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:12.220
the ugly,
let's go see what people are doing.

5
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.633
And I think there are some
really thoughtful,

6
00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:19.670
sophisticated touches on websites,
and we'll see.

7
00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:27.149
Sometimes I feel that that goal, that
purpose of how is someone gonna use this?

8
00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.389
Even when the care is there, the attention
is there, sometimes that gets lost.

9
00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:35.407
So kind of keep that in mind of
thinking through the full workflow,

10
00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:40.357
put yourself in someone's shoes and
think about, okay, if I can't use a mouse,

11
00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:43.185
am I really gonna be able to use this?

12
00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:46.905
Not just like, it kind of works,
but really, cuz that's the stakes.

13
00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:51.968
We can't go part way, we really have
to think through the experience and

14
00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:56.375
working with people with disabilities,
that can be helpful.

15
00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:57.855
We'll talk about that.

16
00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:01.805
But I think as developers,
we have to get those muscles,

17
00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:06.498
I guess we have to strengthen those
muscles of like thinking through

18
00:01:06.498 --> 00:01:10.237
the user experience for accessibility.

19
00:01:10.237 --> 00:01:14.447
So let's start with Stripe, stripe.com,

20
00:01:14.447 --> 00:01:19.779
pretty influential finance
startup on the bigger side.

21
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.900
Gorgeous.

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.473
They have great gradients and colors and
type and it's just like their brand is so

23
00:01:26.473 --> 00:01:28.050
consistent.

24
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.590
They do a lot of really thoughtful
things with their design system.

25
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.660
And so, let's test it.

26
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.490
I think they've been working
on accessibility a little bit.

27
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.910
It's not been the best, historically, so
I was very curious to see what's going on.

28
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.250
So the first thing I always do is Tab,
Tab through the keyboard.

29
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.250
So they've got a mega menu.

30
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.620
They open it when I Tab through, but

31
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.110
they don't force me through all
of the sub items, so that's nice.

32
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.906
I can use the arrow keys to navigate
through instead of Tab, I can hit Escape.

33
00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:06.566
It moved me back somewhere,
but my focus was lost.

34
00:02:06.566 --> 00:02:10.483
So that's one little improvement we could
make is show the focus outline when your

35
00:02:10.483 --> 00:02:11.726
focus goes back.

36
00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:14.002
Cuz the Escape key is a convention for

37
00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:17.296
focus management to put
me back where I was.

38
00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:19.270
I always try it even if it isn't wired up.

39
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.072
[LAUGH] So, now if I hit Tab again,
somehow I think maybe the focus didn't

40
00:02:24.072 --> 00:02:28.323
get put back, because my focus is
down below the header now, and

41
00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:31.685
I didn't actually go
through all the items.

42
00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:34.135
So I think we might have lost focus.

43
00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:37.946
And what Chrome will do, not all
browsers do this, but it will try and

44
00:02:37.946 --> 00:02:42.616
replace your focus in the, I think it's
called the sequential focus access point,

45
00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:44.662
something like that.

46
00:02:44.662 --> 00:02:47.812
And if you delete a node that
you're currently focused on,

47
00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:50.332
that's their API to figure
out where to put it,

48
00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:53.702
instead of they don't kick you
all the way back to the top.

49
00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:57.452
So I'm kind of close, but
not really where I need to be.

50
00:02:57.452 --> 00:03:01.822
So if we manually manage that, we'll guide
the user back to where they need to be

51
00:03:01.822 --> 00:03:04.907
instead of just leaving
it up to the browser.

52
00:03:04.907 --> 00:03:08.487
So there's our first
focus management lesson.

53
00:03:10.127 --> 00:03:11.787
But they do have focus outlines.

54
00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:13.047
That's great.

55
00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:18.627
I mean we're fine-tuning something that
has some accessibility mojo going already.

56
00:03:18.627 --> 00:03:20.285
That's a good start.

57
00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:24.765
So, now we're down to
an auto animating widget.

58
00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:25.745
It's really pretty.

59
00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:31.225
It has all these icons, they're focusable,
but they are automatically animating.

60
00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:37.045
There's no pause button, so that's
an accessibility violation, actually.

61
00:03:37.045 --> 00:03:40.557
We have to allow a way to pause,
stop or hide, and

62
00:03:40.557 --> 00:03:44.825
auto moving animations,
auto playing video.

63
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:50.365
So also, I love that I can focus on these,
but they disappear.

64
00:03:51.455 --> 00:03:52.775
I'm gonna watch it for a minute.

65
00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:55.425
So I'm focused on one,
I guess that one's still visible.

66
00:03:56.695 --> 00:04:03.306
But if I Tab around, yeah, I don't know
that these all need to be focusable.

67
00:04:03.306 --> 00:04:06.406
And they actually go to places,
these are links.

68
00:04:06.406 --> 00:04:08.276
I got one that I can't.

69
00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:11.926
So if you do Tab around, sometimes
you Tab on one that you can't see.

70
00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.756
So it's just interesting.

71
00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:16.426
Yeah, there's a lot going on.

72
00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:21.719
So kind of last thought on the motion
is if I open my system settings and

73
00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:26.650
I go to Accessibility, Display,
there's this setting called

74
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.572
Reduce Motion that I had turned on, but
the site is not stopping the motion.

75
00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:37.224
So that's one thing they could do is
only animate if that is unchecked or

76
00:04:37.224 --> 00:04:41.269
if there is no setting for it,
that's another way to do it.

77
00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:47.021
But it would be kind of distracting
if you're really affected by motion,

78
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:49.710
it gives you seizures at worst, or

79
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.409
people with ADHD sometimes have
a very hard time staying focused.

80
00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.059
So any time that you can opt
in to reducing motion to

81
00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:02.595
just not animate, do it.

82
00:05:02.595 --> 00:05:04.422
[LAUGH] It's pretty easy and

83
00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:09.195
it can really help with people's
distractibility and not cause harm.

84
00:05:10.955 --> 00:05:15.105
And these icons, unless you hover,
you don't see what these are.

85
00:05:15.105 --> 00:05:20.424
So they're really cute icons, it just
it's not always intuitive what they are.

86
00:05:20.424 --> 00:05:22.544
And if you can hover on
them to see what they are,

87
00:05:22.544 --> 00:05:26.704
you should be able to see what they
are when you focus with the keyboard.

88
00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:29.394
So, yeah, a lot going on here.

89
00:05:29.394 --> 00:05:31.694
And we could keep going, but
i wanna go to the next site.

90
00:05:31.694 --> 00:05:34.774
So, another one, we have a question.

91
00:05:34.774 --> 00:05:37.533
&gt;&gt; So really quickly,
i guess i just wanted to get some

92
00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:41.782
information on what's generally expected
when navigating with arrow keys?

93
00:05:41.782 --> 00:05:44.674
Because when I was trying to
navigate through the mega menus,

94
00:05:44.674 --> 00:05:47.762
I tried pressing left and
right and it wasn't always working.

95
00:05:47.762 --> 00:05:51.527
I wasn't sure if there was like a general,
I don't want to call them best practices,

96
00:05:51.527 --> 00:05:55.022
but I guess expected conventions for
people navigating through things.

97
00:05:55.022 --> 00:05:55.842
&gt;&gt; Great question.

98
00:05:55.842 --> 00:05:58.252
So question about the arrow keys.

99
00:05:58.252 --> 00:06:02.095
So, when we hit Tab,
I'm gonna go back to the top.

100
00:06:02.095 --> 00:06:05.825
I just clicked up the top and
it set my focus point up there.

101
00:06:05.825 --> 00:06:09.683
So when we have links, and
default buttons, and form controls,

102
00:06:09.683 --> 00:06:11.445
they are reachable with Tab.

103
00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:16.376
And the arrow keys are more for
appy desktop menus,

104
00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.339
like the Chrome desktop menu.

105
00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:23.260
Or if you have something like a date
picker where you don't wanna tab through

106
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.179
every day in a month.

107
00:06:25.179 --> 00:06:29.467
That we wanna use something that we will
learn about a little later called roving

108
00:06:29.467 --> 00:06:30.919
tab index.

109
00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:33.469
Some of this depends on
what roles things have.

110
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:37.019
So we don't wanna just wire up
the arrow keys for every mega menu.

111
00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:39.442
It really depends how it's marked up for

112
00:06:39.442 --> 00:06:43.956
that to be clear to a screen
reader user and to work properly.

113
00:06:43.956 --> 00:06:46.866
So we could go and look.

114
00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:51.722
I think they probably made the top level
not work with the arrow keys because

115
00:06:51.722 --> 00:06:53.276
of how it's marked up.

116
00:06:53.276 --> 00:06:54.964
So I'm looking in the DevTools.

117
00:06:54.964 --> 00:07:00.107
And I see some tab index on a div,
so I already know

118
00:07:00.107 --> 00:07:07.363
that could be an issue because a div
is not an interactive element.

119
00:07:07.363 --> 00:07:12.233
We can put tab index on it, but
in a screen reader it's still a div.

120
00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.496
So in our initial kind of keyboard test,

121
00:07:14.496 --> 00:07:18.894
I'm really glad you asked this because
we only looked with the keyboard.

122
00:07:18.894 --> 00:07:23.304
I didn't test it with a browser extension
yet or with a screen reader yet.

123
00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:26.392
It is possible to make things that
work really well with a keyboard and

124
00:07:26.392 --> 00:07:28.814
don't work at all on a screen reader.

125
00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:35.634
So, we kind of have to do this
multi-pass testing on it.

126
00:07:35.634 --> 00:07:39.867
But if we start with the keyboard and we
test with a browser extension like Acts,

127
00:07:39.867 --> 00:07:43.339
a lot of the time we can catch some
of the stuff before we even fire up

128
00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:45.185
a screen reader.

129
00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:46.205
But we will do that too.

130
00:07:47.725 --> 00:07:52.177
So for this one, I think they
didn't include the arrow keys for

131
00:07:52.177 --> 00:07:56.293
some of the items, but yeah,
if I were gonna work on this,

132
00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:59.571
I would evaluate kind
of the overall picture.

133
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:01.422
What roles do we have?

134
00:08:01.422 --> 00:08:02.412
How should it work?

135
00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:07.292
When you are looking for
those conventions,

136
00:08:07.292 --> 00:08:13.162
the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide
can really give you some ideas.

137
00:08:13.162 --> 00:08:18.362
So these patterns and components, the
ARIA APG, these are meant to show you how

138
00:08:18.362 --> 00:08:23.448
to do some of these patterns, I will
caution they're not production ready.

139
00:08:23.448 --> 00:08:28.678
[LAUGH] But you can at least see
what's the expected patterns for,

140
00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:31.163
say, a menu or lists of links.

141
00:08:31.163 --> 00:08:33.753
They do a really good job of
differentiating those things.

142
00:08:33.753 --> 00:08:34.623
Question.

143
00:08:34.623 --> 00:08:36.847
&gt;&gt; Will we be talking
more about solutions for

144
00:08:36.847 --> 00:08:39.589
examples like the animation you showed?

145
00:08:39.589 --> 00:08:43.304
I'm realizing this is
a very common example, and

146
00:08:43.304 --> 00:08:49.053
I think it would be difficult to encourage
stakeholders to make any changes to

147
00:08:49.053 --> 00:08:54.959
exciting landing page animations
that are core to the actual design.

148
00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:57.129
I'm curious about alternative approaches.

149
00:08:58.169 --> 00:08:59.183
&gt;&gt; Great question.

150
00:08:59.183 --> 00:09:03.303
I mean, in this workshop,
we're not diving too deeply into motion.

151
00:09:03.303 --> 00:09:07.303
I will say that my web app workshop,
we did.

152
00:09:07.303 --> 00:09:09.963
We had a whole exercise with motion.

153
00:09:09.963 --> 00:09:14.043
So I think we are gonna talk
about providing alternatives

154
00:09:14.043 --> 00:09:18.810
with user interfaces when we talk
about minimum viable products.

155
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.989
So-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for that,

156
00:09:20.989 --> 00:09:24.025
you showed prefers reduced motion, right?

157
00:09:24.025 --> 00:09:24.535
&gt;&gt; Correct.

158
00:09:24.535 --> 00:09:26.505
Yeah, there's a CSS media query.

159
00:09:26.505 --> 00:09:32.117
So I guess for the motion piece, one
piece of advice I could say is that you

160
00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:38.035
can use that media query for
people who say, I don't want motion.

161
00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:41.355
And for anyone else who doesn't even
check that setting, it'll look the same.

162
00:09:42.505 --> 00:09:47.229
So I think for people, stakeholders that
you have to convince, you could say, well,

163
00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:49.235
if you never turn on reduced motion,

164
00:09:49.235 --> 00:09:53.855
then you won't even see it being
static [LAUGH], you won't even know.

165
00:09:53.855 --> 00:09:56.225
But the people who need
that setting will benefit.

166
00:09:56.225 --> 00:09:58.882
So yeah, maybe that argument could help.

167
00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:03.213
Okay, so another one from Stripe.

168
00:10:03.213 --> 00:10:07.603
This is their checkout
kind of use case example.

169
00:10:07.603 --> 00:10:09.633
So we have one for one time payments.

170
00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:15.943
And so the examples themselves,
that's part of evaluating these things.

171
00:10:15.943 --> 00:10:19.803
Sometimes the examples have components
around them that are just part of

172
00:10:19.803 --> 00:10:20.489
the demo.

173
00:10:20.489 --> 00:10:24.429
So you kind of have to differentiate
which pieces am I really evaluating.

174
00:10:24.429 --> 00:10:28.609
But for this one, I think they use
components that are available throughout.

175
00:10:29.739 --> 00:10:32.529
So there are some radio buttons here.

176
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:36.499
There's some little toggles.

177
00:10:36.499 --> 00:10:41.468
So what I wanted to show you here is that
there these dropdowns that I can reach and

178
00:10:41.468 --> 00:10:45.713
operate with the mouse, but
I can't use a keyboard.

179
00:10:45.713 --> 00:10:48.654
So that's like when you're
testing with the keyboard,

180
00:10:48.654 --> 00:10:52.527
if you skip past things like that,
you know immediately, I need to dig in.

181
00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:53.677
What's going on here?

182
00:10:53.677 --> 00:10:57.390
So that's your first or
one of the first gonna get like,

183
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.321
what should make your
spidey senses go off?

184
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:04.015
And we have a whole section on that later,
[LAUGH] but this is one of those things.

185
00:11:04.015 --> 00:11:07.668
And I inspect it and
the Chrome DevTools, guess what?

186
00:11:07.668 --> 00:11:12.572
It's a div with no interactive role,
nothing like button or, I mean,

187
00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:17.748
it's a plane div, it's a generic element,
it has tab index of zero on it.

188
00:11:17.748 --> 00:11:22.453
So I can reach it, but I can't
understand what it is if I'm in a screen

189
00:11:22.453 --> 00:11:25.306
reader cuz it's just a generic element.

190
00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:30.367
So yeah, there's other pieces
that you have to think about,

191
00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:33.966
especially when you're
making interactive widgets.

192
00:11:33.966 --> 00:11:35.556
Let's do one more.

193
00:11:35.556 --> 00:11:36.056
GitHub.

194
00:11:37.056 --> 00:11:39.449
They've done a lot of really
great work for accessibility.

195
00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:44.252
I think a lot of organizations have, and
sometimes they'll be stronger in some

196
00:11:44.252 --> 00:11:48.838
aspects than others, but I think GitHub
has a lot of really neat interactive

197
00:11:48.838 --> 00:11:51.509
widgets that are more
on the advanced side.

198
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:55.109
They have a skip link at the top,
so that's super helpful.

199
00:11:56.109 --> 00:12:02.800
They have a lot of these interactive
widgets that you can Tab onto.

200
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.830
If you hit the Enter key it will open.

201
00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.740
You can hit Escape, it sends you back.

202
00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.410
I see my focus outline
of where I was placed.

203
00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:16.449
They have these really neat kind of like,
not list box,

204
00:12:16.449 --> 00:12:23.407
these pop-ups that trap your focus
in here so I can use arrow keys.

205
00:12:23.407 --> 00:12:26.497
That focus style on these
items is pretty faint.

206
00:12:26.497 --> 00:12:29.137
I think the blue might have
worked a little better.

207
00:12:29.137 --> 00:12:33.380
But I can cycle around through
all this list of items,

208
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:37.257
I can get to all of these things and
I can use them.

209
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:42.674
I'm not getting stuck behind this layer,
and I can hit Escape to go back again.

210
00:12:42.674 --> 00:12:46.364
So as you're navigating around
the keyboard, I can highlight so

211
00:12:46.364 --> 00:12:51.564
many issues just with the keyboard,
before I even open a browser extension.

212
00:12:51.564 --> 00:12:54.825
So if we do that as our kind
of our first workflow step,

213
00:12:54.825 --> 00:12:57.824
we're gonna catch a lot of stuff.

214
00:12:57.824 --> 00:13:00.448
And do some of these
workflow steps on sites, and

215
00:13:00.448 --> 00:13:03.867
we'll detail some of those
steps a little bit later.

216
00:13:03.867 --> 00:13:06.307
But that's like a little introduction.

217
00:13:06.307 --> 00:13:07.417
&gt;&gt; Got a question.

218
00:13:07.417 --> 00:13:12.057
So companies that are big like Stripe, how
is it that they can miss some basic stuff

219
00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:15.167
like not being able to focus a drop down,
for example?

220
00:13:15.167 --> 00:13:17.819
Do you think it's just
speed of deployments or

221
00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:20.952
there's no solid QA process or
maybe all of the above?

222
00:13:20.952 --> 00:13:24.837
Or, yeah, we don't really know,
right, but how could that be missed?

223
00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:28.685
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's all the above,
but I think the biggest thing is

224
00:13:28.685 --> 00:13:34.237
that when there isn't a culture of testing
it, people just don't think about it.

225
00:13:34.237 --> 00:13:37.027
And people reviewing it, don't test it.

226
00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:42.891
It's just like, it's not part of the
definition of done, we'll talk about that.

227
00:13:42.891 --> 00:13:46.501
So yeah, there's kind of just like a lack
of accountability, and that is so common.

228
00:13:46.501 --> 00:13:48.421
I'm definitely not singling them out.

229
00:13:48.421 --> 00:13:53.511
I think they do a lot of really beautiful
work, it's just kind of the way things go.

230
00:13:53.511 --> 00:13:57.100
So we have to find those processes
that do make it repeatable and

231
00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.791
that do get that people thinking about it,
cuz some of this stuff is not that hard.

232
00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:06.627
You just take a little bit of time,
get in the habit, you do it regularly,

233
00:14:06.627 --> 00:14:08.851
you find all kinds of stuff.

234
00:14:08.851 --> 00:14:12.801
And you don't have to be a super
expert at accessibility either.

235
00:14:12.801 --> 00:14:16.021
I mean, it helps to gain your knowledge
and that's what we're here to do.

236
00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:19.837
But I think there's some really basic
stuff that if you know what to look for,

237
00:14:19.837 --> 00:14:21.198
it's pretty easy to find.
