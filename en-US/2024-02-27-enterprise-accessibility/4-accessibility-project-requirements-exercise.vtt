WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's do an exercise,
a bit of a discussion.

2
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:09.748
We're gonna look at a feature that we're
thinking about building, and we're

3
00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:14.164
gonna talk about all of the components
of this that we need to think about for

4
00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:15.236
accessibility.

5
00:00:15.236 --> 00:00:23.035
So we're gonna look at a typeahead search
component modeled after the one on Amazon.

6
00:00:23.035 --> 00:00:25.625
It has a lot of features built into it.

7
00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.388
So, what questions are we
gonna ask up front?

8
00:00:28.388 --> 00:00:33.702
What would we need to include or
not include to do this in phases?

9
00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.830
What's critical to business needs?

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.919
What are the accessibility factors
that we need to think about?

11
00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:41.465
So yeah, what are the requirements?

12
00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:43.236
What would we need to cut if we had to?

13
00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:48.718
Like if we're just not going to get this
shipped on time, what could we phase in?

14
00:00:48.718 --> 00:00:52.183
So kind of looking at the overall
picture just to describe.

15
00:00:52.183 --> 00:00:56.406
So it's the search Amazon kind of omnibox,
so

16
00:00:56.406 --> 00:01:01.619
it has searching recommendations,
like random stuff.

17
00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:06.654
It's Christmas time, so
this is what Amazon suggested to me.

18
00:01:06.654 --> 00:01:11.418
But yeah, does anyone want to kind of take
a first pass at talking about what you

19
00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:14.462
think the accessibility
requirements would be?

20
00:01:16.157 --> 00:01:17.048
Sure.

21
00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:21.208
&gt;&gt; So I guess keyboard navigation, so
making sure that you can navigate through

22
00:01:21.208 --> 00:01:24.344
items with the tap keys,
potentially the arrow keys, and

23
00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:27.676
then also making sure that
you're trapping focus properly.

24
00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:31.558
And if somebody presses escape,
it goes back to where you were and

25
00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.815
you're not suddenly getting
thrown somewhere else.

26
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.550
&gt;&gt; Love it, yeah, that's great.

27
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.133
Any other thoughts?

28
00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.664
&gt;&gt; When you are focused on the search box,

29
00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:50.663
is there a way to cue to the user
that all that information is there?

30
00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:52.740
&gt;&gt; Good thinking.

31
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.298
&gt;&gt; It's like if I'm thinking about it and
I tab to it,

32
00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:58.165
I don't know,
is it going to read the placeholder to me?

33
00:01:58.165 --> 00:01:59.053
I don't know.

34
00:01:59.053 --> 00:02:04.673
But then how do I know that there's like
a bunch of trending stuff down there?

35
00:02:04.673 --> 00:02:08.010
Or maybe like my past
searches might be there.

36
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.617
&gt;&gt; Totally.

37
00:02:08.617 --> 00:02:10.851
&gt;&gt; If you use alert or
something for that or.

38
00:02:10.851 --> 00:02:12.002
&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably.

39
00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:15.500
Yeah, so the word I was struggling
to find earlier is combo box.

40
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.692
So there's list boxes and combo boxes,
and this is probably a combo box.

41
00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:22.471
So it's in a text input or
search input that

42
00:02:22.471 --> 00:02:26.732
might bring up a slightly different
keyboard on a mobile device.

43
00:02:26.732 --> 00:02:30.397
But when you type into it or
even just focus into it,

44
00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:32.802
it opens all these suggestions.

45
00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:38.612
So there's also the scrollable region kind
of in between, like I've been shopping for

46
00:02:38.612 --> 00:02:43.651
toddler Christmas [LAUGH] gifts obviously,
but that needs to be reachable.

47
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:45.509
So the kind of best practice for

48
00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:50.226
that is when you have a region like that
with overflow, either X or Y to scroll,

49
00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:53.669
you put a tab index on it and
then you can use the arrow key.

50
00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.606
So you can reach it and then you can
actually use the arrow keys for that.

51
00:02:57.606 --> 00:03:00.306
I didn't know that right away,
I had to learn that too.

52
00:03:00.306 --> 00:03:05.053
But you've made a really good point that
we have to announce these items somehow.

53
00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:09.900
So, combo boxes,
there's a really great one that

54
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.857
Kent C Dodds worked on called Downshift.

55
00:03:13.857 --> 00:03:16.321
You could take some inspiration from that.

56
00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.099
I've contributed to this one as well,

57
00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.485
they're really great about open source and
accessibility.

58
00:03:23.485 --> 00:03:28.200
But there's a live region in this one,
so that's how I think the Amazon

59
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.088
version could work is, in ARIA,
we have this thing called Live Regions.

60
00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:35.918
And so
you can announce things to a screen reader

61
00:03:35.918 --> 00:03:38.617
without moving the user's keyboard focus.

62
00:03:38.617 --> 00:03:41.723
So I think a live region would
be pretty important in here and

63
00:03:41.723 --> 00:03:43.970
we'd have to figure out what to announce.

64
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.351
Like, should you announce all the items?

65
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.838
I think a practice more
of the time is to say,

66
00:03:50.838 --> 00:03:55.375
toddler toilet seat in all departments,
14 results.

67
00:03:55.375 --> 00:04:00.115
And then the system should usually say
arrow down to navigate through the items.

68
00:04:00.115 --> 00:04:04.254
The screen reader, if you're marking
things up using standard patterns,

69
00:04:04.254 --> 00:04:07.035
it will often tell the user
how to navigate with it,

70
00:04:07.035 --> 00:04:11.388
and that is configurable, like it depends
what screen reader they're using.

71
00:04:11.388 --> 00:04:16.803
So, we don't want to be too
prescriptive with our announcements.

72
00:04:16.803 --> 00:04:21.610
And this would be a really great candidate
for some user testing with people who use

73
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.755
screen readers,
people who have limited mobility.

74
00:04:24.755 --> 00:04:28.929
I mean, for something as like revenue
generating as an Amazon search box,

75
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:31.325
you've got the budget to do user testing.

76
00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:34.189
Like it really should be a part of it.

77
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:39.901
I mean, this is a core user flow, like as
core as it gets is the Amazon search box,

78
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:44.868
or if you're a retailer that's a huge
way that people find products.

79
00:04:44.868 --> 00:04:48.087
But marking it up like
we have lists of items,

80
00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:53.190
we want to mark those up in unordered
lists, use headings if possible.

81
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.869
I guess have some design decisions
on whether this is a modal or

82
00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:58.087
non-modal layer.

83
00:04:58.087 --> 00:05:01.221
Like should we trap
people's focus in there?

84
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:04.367
Probably, but
that's something we think about.

85
00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:10.364
&gt;&gt; Would you want alt text on those
images or are the labels enough?

86
00:05:10.364 --> 00:05:11.293
&gt;&gt; Good question.

87
00:05:11.293 --> 00:05:15.678
So we have some images under keep shopping
for, there's some toy foods and books and

88
00:05:15.678 --> 00:05:18.966
keyboards that I'm getting my daughter for
Christmas [LAUGH].

89
00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:21.814
Yeah, so there's images and text.

90
00:05:21.814 --> 00:05:24.730
So if we look at what the images are,

91
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.607
they're potentially more
detailed than what the text is.

92
00:05:29.607 --> 00:05:35.621
It's kind of a squishy decision to make,
cuz it's a little bit subjective,

93
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:40.339
but I think sometimes the image
alt text can be informative,

94
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.043
where maybe it's a product name.

95
00:05:43.043 --> 00:05:48.202
I recognize that product when I look at
it, so if somebody's been searching for

96
00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:52.976
that type of product and we include
that information in the alt text, it is

97
00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:57.904
a slightly different piece of content
than the text label cuz the portable,

98
00:05:57.904 --> 00:06:02.832
an arranger, whatever that cut off
keyboard thing is, the label for that,

99
00:06:02.832 --> 00:06:04.836
that's probably a category.

100
00:06:04.836 --> 00:06:10.136
Whereas the actual product that's being
shown is something I recognize visually.

101
00:06:10.136 --> 00:06:12.765
So there we can kind of
see a potential gap.

102
00:06:12.765 --> 00:06:18.859
If we think it's best to hide information
just because that's what we assumed,

103
00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:21.738
it might not be the right assumption.

104
00:06:21.738 --> 00:06:26.392
We think through, that's like why it's so
important to think about people with

105
00:06:26.392 --> 00:06:30.706
disabilities early on is because I'm
thinking about that experience of,

106
00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:35.171
well, no, I would want a blind person
to be able to recognize a product also.

107
00:06:35.171 --> 00:06:38.406
Even though, I mean,
that's a visual thing, but

108
00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:43.082
we can kind of backfill have pixels
with text by using alt text and images.

109
00:06:43.082 --> 00:06:45.113
So that's a really great question.

110
00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:48.688
But again-
&gt;&gt; It's something you need to consider

111
00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:53.328
very early on because if, for example,
your content management system doesn't

112
00:06:53.328 --> 00:06:57.105
allow a place for someone to specify,
what is this thing?

113
00:06:57.105 --> 00:07:03.859
The A4 key Casio keyboard,
it's X by Y, it's got these features.

114
00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:04.557
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

115
00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:08.070
&gt;&gt; Where is anyone gonna
source that text from?

116
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.935
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah.

117
00:07:09.935 --> 00:07:15.118
&gt;&gt; And the thought process too kind of
reminds me of mobile first design, right?

118
00:07:15.118 --> 00:07:18.403
If it's not good enough for mobile,
is it good enough for desktop?

119
00:07:18.403 --> 00:07:21.769
And kind of think the same thing
here where it's like, okay,

120
00:07:21.769 --> 00:07:26.041
if we don't think that describing the
image, because maybe in this case not so

121
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:30.573
much, but maybe in a different case where
it's like describing the image might not

122
00:07:30.573 --> 00:07:34.975
be important for the screen reader, well
then we need to make that assumption for

123
00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:37.012
somebody that's looking at it too.

124
00:07:37.012 --> 00:07:38.812
Do we need the image there at all?

125
00:07:38.812 --> 00:07:42.187
Or is it, or, yeah,
the image is really important.

126
00:07:42.187 --> 00:07:44.202
Okay, well then we should describe it.

127
00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:48.227
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think there's some
cases where it is redundant.

128
00:07:48.227 --> 00:07:52.483
Like if it wasn't a category in that
text it was actually the product name,

129
00:07:52.483 --> 00:07:57.148
then you could probably leave the alt text
off the image because it's represented

130
00:07:57.148 --> 00:07:57.977
another way.

131
00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.119
So that would be
a slightly different case.

132
00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:04.485
But yeah, you have to look at
the stuff and evaluate it up front.

133
00:08:04.485 --> 00:08:08.293
We had a great question in our
last workshop about the back-end,

134
00:08:08.293 --> 00:08:12.530
for is there anything we need to think
about on the back-end in our APIs?

135
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:17.369
And here's an example, if you have image
assets you need that alt text as well.

136
00:08:17.369 --> 00:08:20.714
And hopefully it's just
part of the schema for

137
00:08:20.714 --> 00:08:26.479
the data of any of these types of objects,
those products, those thumbnails.

138
00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:30.963
You could use a product title for
the alt text if you needed to but

139
00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:35.116
you want to be choosy,
make sure it works for the use case.

140
00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:39.717
So I love this stuff, I think it's really
fun to think about, because I mean,

141
00:08:39.717 --> 00:08:42.391
it's also really freeing in this exercise.

142
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:45.494
We don't have the real constraints
that you'd be under, so it's like,

143
00:08:45.494 --> 00:08:47.458
thoughts are free,
we can just talk about it.

144
00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:51.564
And so I think it is interesting
to review designs and

145
00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.030
just talk about what are the requirements.

146
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.099
So if you can do this early on,
yeah, do that.

147
00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:01.066
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; To your point,

148
00:09:01.066 --> 00:09:05.993
adding another text field when you're
creating the schema and the API and

149
00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:08.310
all of that, not that expensive.

150
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.214
Retrofitting one after you've already done
it and needing to touch every system it

151
00:09:13.214 --> 00:09:15.988
flows through and so on-
&gt;&gt; That could be hard.

152
00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.248
Yeah, they're distributed.

153
00:09:17.248 --> 00:09:19.323
I mean, that's costly.

154
00:09:19.323 --> 00:09:24.060
But I think the design, even,
if you had to make changes to that,

155
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.987
I mean, with a big enterprise like this,
that's not easy always.

156
00:09:28.987 --> 00:09:33.893
&gt;&gt; Would it be like akin to
progressive enhancement almost,

157
00:09:33.893 --> 00:09:37.906
where I'm just thinking
of getting that data.

158
00:09:37.906 --> 00:09:41.786
I was at Target,
there was a huge issue where,

159
00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:45.469
sellers are uploading this information and

160
00:09:45.469 --> 00:09:50.844
expecting them to know how to
properly describe their images for

161
00:09:50.844 --> 00:09:53.948
an accessible way is like a high bar.

162
00:09:53.948 --> 00:09:59.391
It's like, how do you get,
is it acceptable to just be like,

163
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:04.421
we're gonna consider these
images like icons almost and

164
00:10:04.421 --> 00:10:08.819
where they don't add value,
but is it just kind of

165
00:10:08.819 --> 00:10:13.867
a decision to talk about or
is there a right answer there?

166
00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:18.211
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we kind of highlighted
what I think is the right answer,

167
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:21.747
which is that there's some
benefit in having the image,

168
00:10:21.747 --> 00:10:24.563
at least the product name, described here.

169
00:10:24.563 --> 00:10:29.529
So, I think there's maybe
a way to satisfy a user need,

170
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:34.616
even if the sellers haven't
supplied all that alt text.

171
00:10:34.616 --> 00:10:40.855
Increasingly, there are AI tools for
user generated content for

172
00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:44.945
alt text, but they're not always great.

173
00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.442
I mean, it's not the same.

174
00:10:46.442 --> 00:10:49.302
It'll be like object may
contain plastic fruit,

175
00:10:49.302 --> 00:10:52.169
I mean,
that would be pretty [LAUGH] informative.

176
00:10:52.169 --> 00:10:56.660
But yeah, I mean, sometimes that's
the decision teams are making.

177
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:01.065
I guess what I'm encouraging is to think
through the use cases a little bit more

178
00:11:01.065 --> 00:11:03.080
of like, what's the experience?

179
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.164
And sometimes you have constraints,
there's no way around them.

180
00:11:07.164 --> 00:11:09.131
So you do the best you can,
you mark it up so

181
00:11:09.131 --> 00:11:11.343
that there aren't accessibility failures.

182
00:11:11.343 --> 00:11:16.386
Like if there's image tags in there,
if you absolutely don't have alt texts for

183
00:11:16.386 --> 00:11:19.129
them, put an empty alt
attribute at least so

184
00:11:19.129 --> 00:11:23.433
that it's not reading out some
totally gibberish cached file name or

185
00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:27.612
something cuz that's what will
happen without an alt attribute.

186
00:11:27.612 --> 00:11:32.697
But ideally we can come up with
some sort of dynamic solution.

187
00:11:32.697 --> 00:11:35.374
Yeah, see what you can do, I guess.
