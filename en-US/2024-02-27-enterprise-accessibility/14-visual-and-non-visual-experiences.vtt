00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.609
So, the visual and non-visual experience,
as we are getting more digging

2
00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.797
into accessible names and labels,
we have to think about what's visible,

3
00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:14.463
and what are we trying to put
in our labels and things?

4
00:00:14.463 --> 00:00:22.572
And my main motivation in talking to you
right now about this is to caution you.

5
00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:27.276
There's a temptation to want
to craft the perfect label in

6
00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:31.989
a screen reader when it
reads something like 2,154.

7
00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.715
But that's a weird way to announce
a street number on an address.

8
00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.449
Or it's like you expect it to
be read a certain way, but

9
00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.610
the screen reader is just literally
spitting out the numbers.

10
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.311
That would be weird for
a phone number if it was like,

11
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:52.430
300,110, 456.

12
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.523
You'd be like, wait, that's a phone
number, why is it reading it like that?

13
00:00:55.523 --> 00:01:00.794
Should I make a label that crafts it so
that it announces it the right way?

14
00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:01.613
Don't do it.

15
00:01:01.613 --> 00:01:06.536
[LAUGH] It's a waste of time because
a lot of that stuff is configurable in

16
00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:09.491
the screen reader, so save your effort and

17
00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:13.242
just let it announce
what it's gonna announce.

18
00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:16.878
This is a case where we can
try too hard to fix stuff, and

19
00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:20.892
we're fixing it cuz we
think it needs to be fixed.

20
00:01:20.892 --> 00:01:23.352
Let that come up in an audit or something.

21
00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:26.652
Give it a label,
make sure all the basics are there.

22
00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:30.557
Just yeah, something to deprioritize is
trying to craft the perfect label cuz

23
00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:34.582
you'll chase it forever and
probably end up with something worse.

24
00:01:34.582 --> 00:01:38.392
And there's an article in here
from Adrian Rosselli on this.

25
00:01:38.392 --> 00:01:41.375
It's called Don't Override
Screen Reader Pronunciation.

26
00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.487
And I see this as a topic a lot
that people are talking about in

27
00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:47.899
the community of like,
how do I get it to read out better?

28
00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.921
It's like, well, just don't bother.

29
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:53.177
[LAUGH] Just let it announce
how it's going to announce.

30
00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:56.541
Let the screen reader do what
it's supposed to do, and

31
00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:59.666
let the users configure it or
make sense of that.

32
00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.639
So yeah, it's like we wanna fix it.

33
00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.399
Sometimes it's just not our place.

34
00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:11.723
So some screen reader commands and
interaction modes.

35
00:02:11.723 --> 00:02:16.306
So we've talked a lot about screen
readers, we haven't fired one up yet, so

36
00:02:16.306 --> 00:02:17.444
now is our chance.

37
00:02:17.444 --> 00:02:21.535
We've got some tips and commands for
using various screen readers in here.

38
00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:25.974
There are cheat sheets in here, so this
should help you do some actual testing.

39
00:02:27.644 --> 00:02:33.184
These little details and summary
elements all have more information.

40
00:02:33.184 --> 00:02:37.602
The VoiceOver one is probably the most
complete in terms of how to navigate.

41
00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:41.531
But they all, all of these little
widgets have cheat sheets in them,

42
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:44.580
which are things that you
could share with your team,

43
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.704
anyone who's getting started with screen
reader testing, you can follow these.

44
00:02:49.704 --> 00:02:51.914
You can also print out this PDF of it.

45
00:02:51.914 --> 00:02:55.284
I've put that next to my desk so
that I can just look at it or

46
00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:57.054
at least keep it downloaded.

47
00:02:57.054 --> 00:03:01.518
They have a great note here that
VoiceOver works best with Safari.

48
00:03:01.518 --> 00:03:06.198
It can work with Chrome or Firefox
a little bit better than it used to, but

49
00:03:06.198 --> 00:03:11.741
we don't wanna file bugs against Chrome
and VoiceOver when they're fine in Safari.

50
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.735
It's kind of like,

51
00:03:12.735 --> 00:03:16.251
we don't want to prioritize things
that aren't where the users are.

52
00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:20.941
So we wanna make sure that we look
at VoiceOver and Safari together.

53
00:03:20.941 --> 00:03:25.893
We don't wanna prioritize filing bugs
against Chrome in VoiceOver if they

54
00:03:25.893 --> 00:03:27.314
work fine in Safari.

55
00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:32.141
Because we could be kind of, I don't know,
it's not something we wanna spend time on

56
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:36.117
if it's not really a user issue,
cuz that's not where the users are.

57
00:03:36.117 --> 00:03:38.837
So that's the VoiceOver one.

58
00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:43.808
VoiceOver works with key
command combinations.

59
00:03:43.808 --> 00:03:49.534
So you hold Ctrl+Option and U,
or Ctrl+Option, and right arrow,

60
00:03:49.534 --> 00:03:55.778
whereas NVDA and Windows screen
readers work very differently.

61
00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:58.548
So, I talked about setting
up a virtual machine.

62
00:03:58.548 --> 00:04:02.112
I'm gonna start mine in a second and
you'll see how it looks.

63
00:04:02.112 --> 00:04:04.997
But there's some info in
here with cheat sheets.

64
00:04:04.997 --> 00:04:07.882
There's a how to on how to
use parallels on a Mac.

65
00:04:09.392 --> 00:04:12.272
And so let's talk about Windows.
