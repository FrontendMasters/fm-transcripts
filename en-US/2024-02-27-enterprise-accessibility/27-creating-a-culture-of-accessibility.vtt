00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.671
Let's talk about the things that go
beyond code, that go beyond assertions.

2
00:00:06.671 --> 00:00:10.000
Sometimes the people are what we have.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.480
If I couldn't get those tests
working in time at work,

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.504
I'd have to put it down and move on,
just like we did right now.

5
00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:23.038
And so sometimes, we need to work
around that to work together so

6
00:00:23.038 --> 00:00:26.221
that we have human power to cover it.

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:29.054
The computer wasn't quite there for
me to get that test coverage.

8
00:00:29.054 --> 00:00:34.634
So I'm gonna write testing,
how to reproduce it manually in my PR.

9
00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:39.656
If I couldn't get my test coverage in
on time, but I needed to ship that fix,

10
00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:43.360
I would tell my human colleagues
how to reproduce that.

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.886
So it's actually kind of a teaching
moment that our test didn't work,

12
00:00:46.886 --> 00:00:48.610
because you might run out of time.

13
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.173
And so, we don't wanna just drop it.

14
00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:57.030
We definitely want our team members
to be able to test out things in PRs.

15
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.323
And if you give them testing steps,
they might actually follow them.

16
00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:01.964
That's the thing.

17
00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:06.296
It's kind of like if you never tell anyone
how to reproduce a thing, depending on

18
00:01:06.296 --> 00:01:10.453
your code review culture, they might
just rubber stamp it and not look at it.

19
00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:13.827
Like, they'll look at the code,
but they won't go very deep.

20
00:01:13.827 --> 00:01:16.535
I'm trying to help my teammates.

21
00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:17.876
Yeah, careful what you wish for.

22
00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:21.763
I'm trying to get my teammates to give
me more thorough code reviews, but

23
00:01:21.763 --> 00:01:22.837
they're awesome.

24
00:01:22.837 --> 00:01:25.765
When it comes to how to
reproduce something,

25
00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:30.851
we could really help our teammates and
our QA friends out by saying like, hey,

26
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:35.572
here's how you get this into the state,
here's how how it should work.

27
00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:40.533
And that's like documenting that
contract in words where we could also

28
00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.781
use automation.

29
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:43.169
We should try to get there.

30
00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:49.351
I would be doing more efforts on Monday
to go and fix those text at work.

31
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:52.398
So, when it comes to our organizations,

32
00:01:52.398 --> 00:01:55.968
we wanna build up
the institutional knowledge so

33
00:01:55.968 --> 00:02:01.553
that say I had a medical emergency and
I couldn't go back to work for a while.

34
00:02:01.553 --> 00:02:03.079
How tough would it be for

35
00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.594
my team if I'm the only one that
knows anything about accessibility?

36
00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:12.911
What we really wanna get to is so that
more people know about it, so that you're

37
00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:18.570
more sustainable with it, because it's
not falling on one person's shoulders.

38
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.178
It's spread around.

39
00:02:20.178 --> 00:02:23.791
And we can do so much better that way,
because we have more perspectives,

40
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.735
more people who have their hands in it.

41
00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:29.027
So we increase our
institutional knowledge.

42
00:02:29.027 --> 00:02:33.105
Accessibility specialists work
very hard to get people to care.

43
00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:36.509
Sometimes it can be very difficult, but
there's different approaches to this.

44
00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:42.655
Training, doing audits,
doing hands-on accessibility engineering.

45
00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:47.575
But it sometimes feels like boiling
the ocean when your efforts could just

46
00:02:47.575 --> 00:02:51.395
be deleted with a pull request or
a leadership decision.

47
00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:55.302
So that's partly why we really
need this to be a team sport.

48
00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:58.933
The more people we have aware of it,
the more successful it'll be.

49
00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:03.640
So we want a culture of it.

50
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.601
Rather than isolating this to a few
people, we want a broader effort.

51
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:11.471
We need a culture around it, just like
you might have a design culture or

52
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:12.579
a testing culture.

53
00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.054
We wanna adopt an accessibility culture,
a civil rights culture.

54
00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:20.543
It's like that has some weight to it.

55
00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:23.607
That's really what this is about.

56
00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:28.962
So we started the day talking about that,
we looked at all of the technical parts.

57
00:03:28.962 --> 00:03:32.776
I really wanna bring us full circle
back to what that's all about, and

58
00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:35.505
that is that it's about
people's civil rights.

59
00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:40.959
So how can we do that in a way
that's real, but palatable?

60
00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.712
It's like we wanna balance what's at
stake with bringing people along and

61
00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:47.228
persuading everyone.

62
00:03:47.228 --> 00:03:48.696
So here are some tips.

63
00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:51.352
Do user testing.

64
00:03:51.352 --> 00:03:56.094
Nothing gets designers attention more than
watching someone fail to use something

65
00:03:56.094 --> 00:03:58.136
that they've made and they loved.

66
00:03:58.136 --> 00:03:59.057
And share recordings.

67
00:03:59.057 --> 00:04:00.634
You can record those usually.

68
00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:02.158
When I worked with Faible,

69
00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:06.011
I had recordings of those calls that
I could share with my teammates.

70
00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:09.439
So not everyone needs to be present for
that particular meeting.

71
00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.607
You could share those assets and
many people could learn from that.

72
00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:19.077
And really more than the result of that
one user test, the effect long-term

73
00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:24.290
is that it can teach your team how
people with disabilities use the web and

74
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.929
how they use your product, and
that is worth its weight in gold.

75
00:04:28.929 --> 00:04:32.256
Put an accessibility
statement on your website and

76
00:04:32.256 --> 00:04:36.521
share the feedback that people
give you with the relevant teams.

77
00:04:36.521 --> 00:04:40.721
And I have a link here on what goes
into an accessibility statement.

78
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:45.007
It's usually on the footer of your site,
just like with your privacy statement.

79
00:04:45.007 --> 00:04:49.795
It's a place to give people a way
to contact you, a way to say, hey,

80
00:04:49.795 --> 00:04:55.776
we're aiming to meet WCAG 2.0 [LAUGH]
double A, even though it's 20 years old.

81
00:04:55.776 --> 00:05:01.490
We are trying to meet WCAG 2.1, whatever
standard you're aiming for, document that.

82
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.175
And don't be like, we're compliant,
probably not helpful.

83
00:05:05.175 --> 00:05:06.434
Say, we're working on it.

84
00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:11.136
We're aware of it, where it's
the standard we're aiming to meet.

85
00:05:11.136 --> 00:05:14.377
Because you don't wanna make false claims.

86
00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:16.916
You wanna be real about it and
invite people feedback.

87
00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:21.471
Because any feedback you can get
from real users, those are gifts.

88
00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:22.602
It's amazing.

89
00:05:22.602 --> 00:05:27.600
Include accessibility documentation
in easy-to-find places,

90
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.658
such as testing tips, user short testing,
or sorry, user keyboard shortcuts.

91
00:05:33.658 --> 00:05:37.191
Like, are users gonna ever
be able to find those?

92
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:43.711
And for your internal folks,
are there docs on how to test things?

93
00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:47.342
If there's a place that you could
share that, that'd be awesome.

94
00:05:47.342 --> 00:05:48.482
Have lunch and learns.

95
00:05:48.482 --> 00:05:53.116
Maybe you could watch a conference talk or
something as a team.

96
00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:57.294
Or maybe your team member wrote
something for accessibility and

97
00:05:57.294 --> 00:05:59.392
they could do a quick demo on it.

98
00:05:59.392 --> 00:06:03.360
Make a culture of knowledge sharing.

99
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.459
If you're in an office,
take a cue from Google.

100
00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:11.223
They used to put a printout in the
bathroom stalls [LAUGH] to kind of catch

101
00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:14.963
people when they're taking
some time to themselves.

102
00:06:14.963 --> 00:06:16.737
I mean, you could have a tip.

103
00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:20.556
Something really bite-size,
easy to remember,

104
00:06:20.556 --> 00:06:25.454
just like some workflow tip for
accessibility, awareness tip.

105
00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:30.709
Talk about accessibility in planning,
design, and code reviews, bring it up.

106
00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.214
The earlier the better.

107
00:06:32.214 --> 00:06:33.984
But that's how this work gets done.

108
00:06:33.984 --> 00:06:38.721
That's where the rubber meets
the road is when we bring it up,

109
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:41.009
and we do something about it.

110
00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:43.258
Do the best we can there.

111
00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:47.678
And make everyone responsible for
it, not just the one champion.

112
00:06:47.678 --> 00:06:49.239
They're gonna burn out, maybe.

113
00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:50.411
That happens.

114
00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:53.003
And we wanna take care
of our team members,

115
00:06:53.003 --> 00:06:55.817
like your tech leads,
watch out for burnout.

116
00:06:55.817 --> 00:06:59.198
Because it's unfortunately
common in accessibility.

117
00:06:59.198 --> 00:07:02.624
People have lofty ideals and
we wanna do good and

118
00:07:02.624 --> 00:07:07.345
we want to make a difference,
but it's not always sustainable.

119
00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:11.453
It's hard to hear no when you're like,
but this is essential.

120
00:07:11.453 --> 00:07:12.534
It's a tough place to be in.

121
00:07:12.534 --> 00:07:17.528
So watch your team members, try and have
those working relationships where they

122
00:07:17.528 --> 00:07:20.767
trust you to actually tell
you how things are going.

123
00:07:20.767 --> 00:07:24.622
And find sustainable improvements
that bring joy and satisfaction.

124
00:07:24.622 --> 00:07:29.167
Find the things you can control,
that you can do, and

125
00:07:29.167 --> 00:07:33.213
cross some stuff off your list,
get some wins.

126
00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:35.086
And of course,
these are all my suggestions.

127
00:07:35.086 --> 00:07:39.292
These are just things I've seen over time,
leading teams, being on teams.

128
00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:40.901
And so your mileage will vary.

129
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:44.771
I mean, teams are so diverse and
made up of so many different people, and

130
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:48.080
constraints, and
all the things that make our teams unique.

131
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.923
So you have to kind of find what works for
you.

132
00:07:50.923 --> 00:07:52.611
But at the end of the day,

133
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:56.646
this stuff matters because
it's about improving access.

134
00:07:56.646 --> 00:07:58.520
So, we wanna try and do our best and

135
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.311
push the limits whenever
we get that opportunity.

136
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:06.385
It's like, if we just stretch a little
bit, maybe we could get this in.

137
00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:09.147
We wanna be civilized about it.

138
00:08:09.147 --> 00:08:12.346
We don't need to overwork ourselves or
something.

139
00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:15.791
But if you can just push a little
bit harder to get something in,

140
00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:17.359
that would be pretty great.
