1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.620
So who is accessibility for?

2
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.397
Because I think sometimes
the idea of accessibility,

3
00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:09.517
when you're a developer or a technologist,

4
00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:14.953
sometimes the purpose of accessibility
can get sort of lost in the messaging.

5
00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:17.735
Of like,
we're gonna add these attributes and

6
00:00:17.735 --> 00:00:20.463
we're gonna make our HTML accessible and
things.

7
00:00:20.463 --> 00:00:24.746
But we wanna understand the goal,
which is to prevent and

8
00:00:24.746 --> 00:00:29.131
remove barriers to access for
people with disabilities.

9
00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.957
So for people who can't see,
people who can't use a mouse,

10
00:00:33.957 --> 00:00:38.034
people who navigate by voice for
various reasons.

11
00:00:38.034 --> 00:00:41.822
There are techniques that we can
incorporate that are not all

12
00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:45.767
that challenging,
they're just forgotten some of the time.

13
00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.496
Some of the techniques are more
advanced and more challenging.

14
00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:52.781
But there are also some
basics that as tech leads,

15
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:59.009
if we can remind people to include
the basics and do a regular workflow for

16
00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:03.415
accessibility, I bet we
could make a huge impact.

17
00:01:03.415 --> 00:01:08.681
So that's kind of my personal
challenge today, is to help you all

18
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:14.636
help other people, cuz it's like this
thing grows and I'm so into that.

19
00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:17.690
So we'll dive deeper into
kind of how to do that,

20
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.016
how to work with people,
how to persuade throughout this workshop.

21
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:27.426
I have kind of a recent example
of increasing awareness.

22
00:01:27.426 --> 00:01:32.841
I gave a presentation at my job, I work
at an agency called Principal Studios,

23
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:36.369
and I went there to be a more
general web developer,

24
00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.847
not an accessibility specialist.

25
00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:43.858
But I could see that, that knowledge that
I have with accessibility would really,

26
00:01:43.858 --> 00:01:45.231
like I had to share it.

27
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:50.227
I'm seeing things in code reviews,
I'm seeing things just in historical

28
00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:55.638
practices of what's been allowed to ship
in the code base, and I had to speak up.

29
00:01:55.638 --> 00:01:59.636
So I did, and my coworkers are smart and
passionate and caring people.

30
00:01:59.636 --> 00:02:03.995
And when I described why we need
to include heading elements, so

31
00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:09.647
H1 through H6 headings, which we'll
talk all about today, my coworker asked,

32
00:02:09.647 --> 00:02:15.162
if it's so critical to get the right
level, what if we just don't use headings?

33
00:02:15.162 --> 00:02:18.692
And so, I have a meme on the screen that
says your headings won't be the wrong

34
00:02:18.692 --> 00:02:21.780
level if you don't use headings,
kind of haha, it's funny, but

35
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.290
use headings though, really.

36
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.292
And when I pointed out the reason
why we use headings and

37
00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.772
other semantic HTML I
shared with them is that,

38
00:02:30.772 --> 00:02:36.166
people who can't see the screen have
a much easier time getting an overall

39
00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:40.802
picture of what's on a page when
there are headings to digest.

40
00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:45.612
You can navigate by headings,
you can see a hierarchy of the content.

41
00:02:45.612 --> 00:02:49.051
They're also great for SEO, and
reader modes, and other things.

42
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:53.715
But I really tried to stress that
the importance of this is for

43
00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.470
a disabled person's experience.

44
00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.326
And my co-workers were like,
I never thought of it like that before,

45
00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:00.969
I get it now.

46
00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.587
And so that kind of cooperative,
open-minded understanding, and

47
00:03:05.587 --> 00:03:08.135
knowledge sharing is really fetal for

48
00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:13.324
getting people more aware of accessibility
so they understand the purpose.

49
00:03:13.324 --> 00:03:17.698
We wanna be friendly messengers,
which can be hard sometimes, but

50
00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:22.304
whenever possible, I think we'll have
more success when we can try and

51
00:03:22.304 --> 00:03:24.780
bring people along and try to make it.

52
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.458
This is serious, it's important, but

53
00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:31.333
we also wanna have good
professional relationships too.

54
00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.463
So, it's kind of a balance.

55
00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.553
At least that's how I approach it.

56
00:03:35.553 --> 00:03:39.488
But I was really encouraged by the
experience of sharing some information,

57
00:03:39.488 --> 00:03:41.465
communicating why it's important.

58
00:03:41.465 --> 00:03:45.246
And people just go, I didn't know,
cool, thanks for telling me.

59
00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:49.955
And then you move on [LAUGH]
hopefully with headings [LAUGH].

60
00:03:52.196 --> 00:03:54.989
So what brought you to this workshop?

61
00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.459
We got some really great stories,
some good motivations from you all so far.

62
00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.871
So I think for anyone watching,
consider what brought you here if you

63
00:04:02.871 --> 00:04:07.144
haven't already,
maybe it's personal interest or curiosity.

64
00:04:07.144 --> 00:04:11.092
Maybe it's a career growth area
that you're thinking about, or

65
00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:13.471
there's a job you really wanna go for.

66
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:16.117
Or maybe it's a professional requirement,

67
00:04:16.117 --> 00:04:20.444
like you had requirements at the 11th
hour or hopefully earlier [LAUGH].

68
00:04:20.444 --> 00:04:25.421
And so whatever the reason, I am super
stoked that you are here because we

69
00:04:25.421 --> 00:04:30.002
have the opportunity to make
a difference in tech with this topic.

70
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:32.414
So accessibility is the right thing to do,

71
00:04:32.414 --> 00:04:35.429
in my opinion,
I'm pretty positive about that, but

72
00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:40.457
it's also about upholding people's civil
rights, people's civil rights to access.

73
00:04:40.457 --> 00:04:45.723
And I think that detail tends to
get lost in the message when we're

74
00:04:45.723 --> 00:04:50.427
focused more on the tech,
really, that's the purpose.

75
00:04:50.427 --> 00:04:53.008
It's also a component of quality software.

76
00:04:53.008 --> 00:04:55.411
When we can write software that is robust,

77
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:59.684
it can respond to new user input events
that we didn't even think about ahead

78
00:04:59.684 --> 00:05:04.656
of time, but our code is architected so
we can respond to any events we want.

79
00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:08.406
We can send it any initial
state we want from anywhere.

80
00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:12.239
When we can write robust
software that's accessible, well,

81
00:05:12.239 --> 00:05:17.085
it's less costly to maintain because
we're not having to jam these features in

82
00:05:17.085 --> 00:05:22.926
after the fact like trying to add mobile
support after the fact, that can be hard.

83
00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:25.896
So the earlier you can
incorporate accessibility,

84
00:05:25.896 --> 00:05:28.586
the more successful it will be.

85
00:05:28.586 --> 00:05:32.712
But sometimes people need more convincing
because there's all this debt,

86
00:05:32.712 --> 00:05:37.095
because it's going to be expensive, or
because people don't think that people

87
00:05:37.095 --> 00:05:39.687
with disabilities are part
of their audience.

88
00:05:40.758 --> 00:05:43.686
So there is a business
side to accessibility,

89
00:05:43.686 --> 00:05:47.148
I have a link in my slides
from a resource from the W3C.

90
00:05:47.148 --> 00:05:50.023
So if you wanna go down that route,

91
00:05:50.023 --> 00:05:55.293
you have stakeholders to convince,
you could bookmark that.

92
00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:58.518
There are some misconceptions
that it's too costly or

93
00:05:58.518 --> 00:06:02.594
too niche to be worthwhile and
it does require some additional time.

94
00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:08.365
So a big enterprise that I worked with,
their estimates were about upfront for

95
00:06:08.365 --> 00:06:13.888
someone of their size, they would
pad estimates by about 30% upfront.

96
00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:18.749
And that was throughout the whole software
development life cycle, through planning,

97
00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:20.966
design, engineering, QA, all of it.

98
00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:26.467
And so that seems like a lot, but the cost
of not doing it can be way higher.

99
00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:31.503
If you have to redo everything, if you
have to hire more people, if you have to

100
00:06:31.503 --> 00:06:36.704
totally re-platform and start over,
that's going to be way more expensive.

101
00:06:36.704 --> 00:06:40.665
And like, even if you don't re-platform,
but you're just trying to chip away at

102
00:06:40.665 --> 00:06:44.514
these bugs and these defects, that's
what they're called in accessibility,

103
00:06:44.514 --> 00:06:46.912
you're trying to keep up
with those all the time.

104
00:06:46.912 --> 00:06:51.643
It's kind of hard to get other feature
work done because you're trying to squash

105
00:06:51.643 --> 00:06:54.565
bugs and trying to clean up
stuff that if it had been

106
00:06:54.565 --> 00:06:58.129
planned better in the beginning,
maybe it would be easier.

107
00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.684
So that upfront investment, it really is
an investment, and so that's a trade-off.

108
00:07:03.684 --> 00:07:06.011
As tech leads, as developers,

109
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:11.891
we're not always in positions to make
those decisions but we do estimate scope.

110
00:07:11.891 --> 00:07:16.191
We do scoping and planning and
backlog grooming and

111
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:19.399
all that stuff, so we can give input.

112
00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:23.331
And so if you can put it in,
I don't know, numerical terms,

113
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:28.214
quantify it somehow, sometimes that's
what leaders want to hear about.

114
00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:32.960
So we really can't afford not to do it,
especially for big enterprises that

115
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.057
have compliance obligations,
which we'll talk about as well.

116
00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:41.358
So that compliance, that risk,
that could be a motivator for

117
00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:46.333
an organization, and lots of
organizations have different reasons.

118
00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:51.311
Sometimes executives have a personal
connection to accessibility,

119
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:55.624
a good example is Satya Nadella
who's the CEO of Microsoft.

120
00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:59.287
He had some family members
with disabilities and

121
00:07:59.287 --> 00:08:05.017
that experience as a leader, I think
has really affected team priorities.

122
00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:09.225
I think that's how these
decisions get made

123
00:08:09.225 --> 00:08:14.352
sometimes is that there's
a reason that they get it.

124
00:08:14.352 --> 00:08:18.182
That's not always gonna happen,
but companies do have,

125
00:08:18.182 --> 00:08:23.654
organizations I should say, it's not
always just companies, but organizations

126
00:08:23.654 --> 00:08:28.681
have legal risk and compliance obligations
that can really bubble this up.

127
00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.034
It depends what type
of business you're in.

128
00:08:31.034 --> 00:08:36.621
If you're anything procured by the federal
government in the United States or

129
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:40.512
Canada, the UK and Australia,
at least to name some,

130
00:08:40.512 --> 00:08:44.762
and that depends on laws that
are on the books a lot of times.

131
00:08:44.762 --> 00:08:49.406
If you're in education, you probably have
to do some things for accessibility,

132
00:08:49.406 --> 00:08:50.900
I mean, you would think.

133
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.520
It's amazing how many opportunities
are missed for accessibility, so

134
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.637
that's why we're here,
is to try and make that better.

135
00:08:59.637 --> 00:09:01.745
There is also market pressure for
accessibility.

136
00:09:01.745 --> 00:09:06.087
So especially in the United States
where we have a litigious culture,

137
00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.112
a lot of accessibility is
decided in the courts.

138
00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:14.187
I don't love that part of it,
to be honest, but that is a reality,

139
00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:19.173
at least in the U.S. So,
the market pressure could come from you

140
00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:23.618
lost business because your
product isn't accessible and

141
00:09:23.618 --> 00:09:28.353
somebody else's is, and so
that could be losing contracts.

142
00:09:28.353 --> 00:09:31.143
You could have a competitor
that got sued in the U.S.

143
00:09:31.143 --> 00:09:34.305
and that could give you some
market pressure of, well,

144
00:09:34.305 --> 00:09:38.039
they're fixing their stuff,
we should be thinking about that, too.

145
00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:40.169
We could be next, you know?

146
00:09:40.169 --> 00:09:44.986
So that kind of competitive
landscape could at least get

147
00:09:44.986 --> 00:09:47.760
maybe a little bit of movement.

148
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.128
And so there's a lot to learn
about the legal side, and

149
00:09:51.128 --> 00:09:56.342
depending on what country you're in, there
are different laws, if there are any.

150
00:09:56.342 --> 00:09:58.627
So you could read up on
the legal requirements for

151
00:09:58.627 --> 00:10:00.029
accessibility in your area.

152
00:10:00.029 --> 00:10:03.380
And someone I recommend
following is Lainey Feingold.

153
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.764
She's a disability rights
attorney from California,

154
00:10:06.764 --> 00:10:10.300
she's been in the accessibility
community for decades.

155
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.376
I love her.

156
00:10:11.376 --> 00:10:15.679
And she has a lot of really great
articles and some information

157
00:10:15.679 --> 00:10:20.078
about global accessibility laws,
so you can check those out.

158
00:10:21.959 --> 00:10:25.568
So the goal of this workshop,
at the heart of it,

159
00:10:25.568 --> 00:10:29.239
I really want to instill these concepts.

160
00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:31.872
I want you to understand
the core requirements for

161
00:10:31.872 --> 00:10:34.539
digital accessibility in the enterprise.

162
00:10:34.539 --> 00:10:38.129
So we'll get tactical, how,
what are we looking for?

163
00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:40.125
What do we not want to let ship?

164
00:10:41.906 --> 00:10:46.034
And as tech leads, you should be able to
advise team members on how to produce

165
00:10:46.034 --> 00:10:47.789
accessible quality software.

166
00:10:47.789 --> 00:10:51.003
It's like if you're leading,
you should be able to give advice.

167
00:10:51.003 --> 00:10:54.775
Maybe you're not totally up to
speed on every technique, but

168
00:10:54.775 --> 00:10:59.722
you at least know the concepts and you
could point people in the right direction.

169
00:10:59.722 --> 00:11:01.145
That would be the goal for today.

170
00:11:03.445 --> 00:11:08.081
So, if you're a Windows user, Windows is
a very valuable testing environment for

171
00:11:08.081 --> 00:11:13.425
accessibility, especially with what
we'll cover today for screen readers.

172
00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:17.630
So, if you are a Windows user, you
should download the NVDA screen reader.

173
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.926
It's free, open source, it's used a lot.

174
00:11:20.926 --> 00:11:23.719
It's actually more popular
than Voiceover on the Mac.

175
00:11:23.719 --> 00:11:28.801
I am a Mac user as well, but I still test
with Windows using a virtual machine.

176
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:32.891
So just something to put
on your software list,

177
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:39.348
if you have VMs at work that you can use,
it's super helpful and seamless.

178
00:11:39.348 --> 00:11:45.171
I use parallels on my Mac,
we'll probably fire it up today.

179
00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:48.756
And that will allow you to test things
in a Windows screen reader that you

180
00:11:48.756 --> 00:11:53.083
simply just can't test that same way with
Voiceover because they work differently.

181
00:11:53.083 --> 00:11:55.639
And I'll tell you why a little bit later.

182
00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.798
And parallels comes
with a Windows license.

183
00:11:57.798 --> 00:12:01.214
I just had to reinstall it on this
new machine and it was really easy.

184
00:12:01.214 --> 00:12:05.713
So, check that out if you are a Mac user.

185
00:12:05.713 --> 00:12:11.094
You may want to remap some of your
laptop keys if you are a Mac user.

186
00:12:11.094 --> 00:12:15.179
So, in Windows keyboards
you have an insert key and

187
00:12:15.179 --> 00:12:21.069
I actually have a physical Windows
keyboard that I use at my home office and

188
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:24.876
that has an insert key but
Mac keyboards do not.

189
00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:28.916
So a lot of people will map their
caps lock key to be the insert key,

190
00:12:28.916 --> 00:12:33.785
it's kind of just like a modifier key that
you can hold when you test with NVDA.

191
00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:38.569
But I actually didn't have to remap
anything when I installed parallels this

192
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:42.561
last week so it seems maybe they
ironed that out, I'm not sure.

193
00:12:42.561 --> 00:12:45.673
And it was also very awesome in parallels,

194
00:12:45.673 --> 00:12:51.552
something that had changed from previous
is that I could pull up my file system and

195
00:12:51.552 --> 00:12:56.662
local host stuff on the Windows side
pretty easily, so that was cool.
