1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.374
To consider accessibility in our
organizations, either where you work now,

2
00:00:04.374 --> 00:00:07.670
a place you worked in the past,
where you would like to work.

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.159
Let's say you're working on a Web app
with a lot of interactions in it,

4
00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:19.086
a lot of reordering, a lot of really
intricate things requiring focus

5
00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.193
management, but none of it is accessible.

6
00:00:22.193 --> 00:00:25.195
You just know there's some
blocking issues in there.

7
00:00:25.195 --> 00:00:27.570
So let's consider some questions.

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.050
Who would you have to convince
to prioritize accessibility?

9
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.448
In your position, who is in the way?

10
00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:37.590
What motivates them?

11
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.365
When you're really getting down to
the nitty-gritty details of presenting

12
00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:45.449
your estimates and things,
how would you scope or

13
00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.797
prioritize your feedback to increase
the chances of them saying yes?

14
00:00:49.797 --> 00:00:55.168
And is there anything you can do to
change the accessibility issues?

15
00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:57.595
What steps would you take
to actually go and fix it?

16
00:00:57.595 --> 00:01:02.602
Cuz that can be helpful as a tech lead,
to send people in the right direction.

17
00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:07.285
So if you have any thoughts on any
of these questions, let's chat for

18
00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:10.127
a minute, and then we'll be done today.

19
00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:17.951
I mean,
are you comfortable saying kinda just,

20
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:23.031
theoretically, where
are the blockers with accessibility?

21
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:24.873
Or where were the blockers?

22
00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:30.644
Cuz you said you had a big, 11th hour
audit that all of a sudden was like,

23
00:01:30.644 --> 00:01:32.583
God, we have to fix this.

24
00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:37.643
&gt;&gt; In terms of what's blocking
the team I'm on, specifically,

25
00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:43.466
or some of the work we're doing,
yeah, it's a complicated question,

26
00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:48.629
mostly to do with resourcing,
and time, and prioritization.

27
00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:53.155
Where the priority for
that application is really to meet

28
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:58.248
existing business commitments,
where accessibility is not,

29
00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:02.882
strictly speaking,
a part of the requirements for that.

30
00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:04.219
Which is disappointing.

31
00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.860
But I can understand high level,

32
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.587
from a business objective,
why that's a concern.

33
00:02:13.587 --> 00:02:17.595
And yeah, the project
prioritization is very much around,

34
00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:22.154
we have to meet these existing
commitments to other partnerships and

35
00:02:22.154 --> 00:02:24.682
then we can move on to the other stuff.

36
00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:27.284
And it's like, okay, well, great.

37
00:02:27.284 --> 00:02:30.825
I'll be patient in the meantime,
I suppose, and

38
00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:35.718
try to continue encouraging
the developers to learn from their peers

39
00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:40.439
on other teams that are making this
more of a regular practice, and

40
00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:45.942
trying to build up the muscles for
how do we include it in regular work.

41
00:02:45.942 --> 00:02:48.929
But yeah, it's a difficult scope and

42
00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:55.342
balancing act with an application that
serves a lot of existing business.

43
00:02:55.342 --> 00:03:00.735
And so the potential impact for
doing some of this kind of

44
00:03:00.735 --> 00:03:06.264
clean up work would be very good,
but it's also costly.

45
00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:12.992
And long term,
the investment has a shelf life.

46
00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:17.617
And that's where quantifying that can be

47
00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:22.383
useful in making, I'll give an example.

48
00:03:23.723 --> 00:03:27.921
Just on quality metrics in general,
we had an automation framework

49
00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:31.760
using Cypress that was really
not providing a lot of benefit.

50
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.241
It wasn't covering the Core user flows.

51
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:40.673
It was constantly flaky for developers.

52
00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:44.856
And the future facing direction was very
much chosen to be, use Playwright instead.

53
00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:54.526
And we had a QA contractor who would have
needed a lot of retraining to do that.

54
00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:57.006
So we ended up letting that person go and

55
00:03:57.006 --> 00:04:00.324
hiring a new contractor to
write Playwright tests.

56
00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:04.164
And I was literally messaging
with him today at lunch.

57
00:04:04.164 --> 00:04:08.752
But that's where we would like to
add the Axe-Core Auditor to that and

58
00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:10.948
add some metric-ing around it.

59
00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:13.340
But even that, it's not a huge effort.

60
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.648
And I expect I might be able
to get a sprint or so, for

61
00:04:18.648 --> 00:04:24.096
one person to work on that in Q1,
but I have to wait.

62
00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:24.783
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting.

63
00:04:24.783 --> 00:04:30.292
Even within one organization,
you can have multiple things that come up.

64
00:04:30.292 --> 00:04:32.182
On one line of business,

65
00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:37.312
it might be that it's a legacy
product that has an end in sight, that

66
00:04:37.312 --> 00:04:43.178
the cost of investing the accessibility
into it just doesn't pencil out.

67
00:04:43.178 --> 00:04:47.315
So there's that, and
then there's the just lack of awareness.

68
00:04:47.315 --> 00:04:52.000
Which, yeah, it's not that anyone's
explicitly blocking accessibility per se,

69
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.888
it's that they just don't know.

70
00:04:54.888 --> 00:04:58.718
But then you get,
we have to go back and fix it.

71
00:04:58.718 --> 00:05:01.432
That's when some of
the leadership blocks happened,

72
00:05:01.432 --> 00:05:03.084
cuz that decision has to be made.

73
00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:05.581
Do we go fix it after the fact or not?

74
00:05:05.581 --> 00:05:09.794
Or do we get investment time up front or
not, so?

75
00:05:11.324 --> 00:05:12.165
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and luckily,

76
00:05:12.165 --> 00:05:14.988
the investment time up front is
happening on the future facing things.

77
00:05:14.988 --> 00:05:16.692
And I'm glad for that.

78
00:05:16.692 --> 00:05:18.723
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

79
00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:23.346
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It'll be a different
conversation for 2.1 and 2.2 compliance.

80
00:05:23.346 --> 00:05:27.625
I had that conversation recently with a
new partnership opportunity that came up.

81
00:05:27.625 --> 00:05:30.279
And they were talking about,
yeah, they want 2.1 compliance.

82
00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.047
And I'm like, that's great.

83
00:05:34.227 --> 00:05:35.960
We needed to do different
work in order for

84
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.199
that to be possible on
the timeline you're suggesting.

85
00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.359
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, that's really interesting.

86
00:05:40.359 --> 00:05:45.149
So kinda getting back to the business
case, I hope that works out.

87
00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:49.105
That could be some lost revenue
because it's not compliant, right?

88
00:05:49.105 --> 00:05:55.086
So that's getting back to what I was
talking about where the market pressure,

89
00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:57.633
you miss out on those contracts.

90
00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:02.275
That is the side that starts
to get people's attention,

91
00:06:02.275 --> 00:06:06.635
people who care a lot about finance,
[LAUGH] or legal.

92
00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:10.808
&gt;&gt; Carolina says we have an internal
Notion page at our company.

93
00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:14.170
And I'm starting a guidelines
documentation for

94
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:19.368
developers to use from scratch
during the development process.

95
00:06:19.368 --> 00:06:24.226
Now I'm making posts over there and
even resharing to our web devs weekly, so

96
00:06:24.226 --> 00:06:27.678
people can actually understand
the importance of it.

97
00:06:28.758 --> 00:06:32.518
I've got people interested in
the last few days, and yeah,

98
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:34.520
talking about your workshops.

99
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.794
And I'm happy to share it.

100
00:06:37.794 --> 00:06:40.394
&gt;&gt; Yay, I love it.

101
00:06:40.394 --> 00:06:42.205
So you can start to see
those light bulbs go on.

102
00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:47.058
&gt;&gt; And Miles says it's sometimes very
difficult to convince higher-ups to care

103
00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:51.912
about accessibility when it doesn't
provide immediate shareholder value,

104
00:06:51.912 --> 00:06:55.455
even though everyone in
the room knows that isn't true.

105
00:06:55.455 --> 00:06:56.794
&gt;&gt; It can be very hard.

106
00:06:58.203 --> 00:07:01.406
Sometimes you have to find those
quick wins that you could just sorta

107
00:07:01.406 --> 00:07:02.483
slip in there anyway.

108
00:07:02.483 --> 00:07:06.063
I'm kind of a rebel in that way, so
I'm always gonna advocate for that.

109
00:07:06.063 --> 00:07:09.971
But it is hard to make that fly sometimes.

110
00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:11.916
Sometimes I can't do that.

111
00:07:11.916 --> 00:07:15.662
And you might not be able to,
if it breaks tether tests or

112
00:07:15.662 --> 00:07:20.144
it's just outside of the scope
of the ticket you're working on.

113
00:07:20.144 --> 00:07:25.133
So yeah, it can be a challenge, but
we're all in this together, really.

114
00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:29.707
I hope by coming to these workshops
that you feel like you're

115
00:07:29.707 --> 00:07:34.291
part of the accessibility community now,
because you are.

116
00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:38.451
We're all just so excited to have
people join the community and

117
00:07:38.451 --> 00:07:41.049
make a difference for accessibility.

118
00:07:41.049 --> 00:07:44.516
No matter where you are in your skill
level, whether you're a tech lead and

119
00:07:44.516 --> 00:07:48.549
just getting started with it or you're
more experienced, we're all here together.

120
00:07:48.549 --> 00:07:51.709
And I just really wanna thank you for
spending all this time with me,

121
00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:53.297
learning about accessibility.

122
00:07:53.297 --> 00:07:58.809
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
