1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.550
So how are we gonna do this?

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.051
We're gonna make it part
of the requirements,

3
00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:07.830
make it part of your definition of done.

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.420
So how do you ensure accessibility
isn't skipped or missed?

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.545
You make it part of your culture,
so include it in ticket stories or

6
00:00:15.545 --> 00:00:20.189
issues kind of hovered terminology you
use, make sure that team members in

7
00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.488
various roles are on board,
like PMs, design, development, QA.

8
00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:27.648
We wanna include it as
acceptance criteria so

9
00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:32.148
we could surface it at a good time
before something has shipped.

10
00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:36.533
And if you have to learn the hard way
about getting an audit at the 11th hour

11
00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:41.074
and having to go back and fix it, that's
a good learning opportunity [LAUGH].

12
00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:45.824
Hopefully, you can fix stuff
a little bit earlier next time.

13
00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:48.074
Hard earned experience, that's for sure.

14
00:00:49.244 --> 00:00:52.321
Because it is way more costly
to fix after the fact.

15
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:52.894
Question.

16
00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:54.464
&gt;&gt; I had a quick question.

17
00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:59.442
I don't know how feasible this is, but
I guess this is a slightly unethical tip.

18
00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:02.896
Is there anything you can do
to get your company under

19
00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:06.832
fire to make them at [LAUGH] more
of a risk of getting out of it.

20
00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:09.022
&gt;&gt; I like the way you're thinking here.

21
00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:10.592
No, probably not a great idea.

22
00:01:10.592 --> 00:01:13.662
I mean, we're all in that boat together.

23
00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:18.592
So, I mean, yeah, I'm not sure,
I haven't ever really tried that.

24
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:19.230
It's like-
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

25
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.759
good
&gt;&gt; Good here.

26
00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.484
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I'm not sure.

27
00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.631
I think pushing for some user testing to

28
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:33.814
gain insight into the areas
that are not working well.

29
00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:39.194
It's kind of that internal motivation
instead of the external motivation.

30
00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:41.975
But do what you gotta do.

31
00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:46.182
[LAUGH] Just don't tell
anyone I told you to do that.

32
00:01:46.182 --> 00:01:50.445
[LAUGH] So we wanna make
accessibility an actual requirement.

33
00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:55.071
And kind of funny story is I worked
on projects where accessibility,

34
00:01:55.071 --> 00:02:00.334
like WCAG 2.1 AA or 2.2 AA, will be
listed in a document somewhere, like

35
00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:06.028
we're aiming to meet it, but then there's
literally no process to actually do it.

36
00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:08.818
Kind of a smell.

37
00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:10.658
It's a process smell.

38
00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:13.128
So it's one thing to
list it as a requirement.

39
00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:15.588
It's another to actually uphold
it throughout the process.

40
00:02:15.588 --> 00:02:18.680
So we wanna actually uphold it
throughout [LAUGH] the process.

41
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.400
So that we are true to our
word that it is a requirement.

42
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.405
I think people are just released with
it actually being part of the regular

43
00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:27.880
workflow.

44
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.455
But there are so many things that I've
shared with you today and in the web

45
00:02:32.455 --> 00:02:37.337
app accessibility workshop that there
have to be some levers you could pull.

46
00:02:37.337 --> 00:02:41.005
I've told you everything I
know about accessibility,

47
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:44.867
probably more than I even
wanted to share with you.

48
00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:49.157
So there are definitely some ways that
we can make accessibility a reality.

49
00:02:49.157 --> 00:02:51.517
It takes a will to do it.

50
00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:56.570
You have to kind of be brave and
go swim against the grain or swim upstream

51
00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.650
a little bit sometimes to be, be like, no,
really, we have to change this process.

52
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.220
So make it repeatable.

53
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.970
Find ways to remind people
in a diplomatic way.

54
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.970
Build it into your automated tests.

55
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.520
Get those working, get those passing.

56
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.280
Build it into performance reviews.

57
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.138
How's that for an idea.

58
00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:24.481
Like that get blame thing,
as a manager, looking in terms of what

59
00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:29.838
performance looks like,
what if accessibility was a category?

60
00:03:31.278 --> 00:03:33.278
I haven't heard of anyone doing that.

61
00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:34.978
It may be for accessibility teams.

62
00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:40.098
But I think if you have some
hotshot developer who always ships

63
00:03:40.098 --> 00:03:45.428
inaccessible code,
maybe that should make them less hotshot.

64
00:03:45.428 --> 00:03:47.728
Maybe that's not helpful.

65
00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.334
So let's gauge performance
factor quality and

66
00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:53.137
accessibility into performance and
interviews,

67
00:03:53.137 --> 00:03:57.388
because we can ask people about this in
interviews on both sides of the table.

68
00:03:58.488 --> 00:04:02.289
So yeah, let's ask about it,
see if it's in their process or not.

69
00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.849
How does this factor into performance and
metrics?

70
00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:06.959
Now we're talking.
