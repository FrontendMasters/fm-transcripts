00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.611
Collections, so Kotlin includes
several collections ready to use,

2
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:07.580
as we expect from a modern language.

3
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.740
So we're not going to cover all of them.

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.910
So let's cover quickly the ones that
we will use during the rest of the day.

5
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.575
We have list, a list is what
we typically know as an array,

6
00:00:18.575 --> 00:00:22.470
okay, but here we have the type list.

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.700
We define the type with angle brackets,
okay?

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.160
This is actually a generic,
in case you know what the generic is.

9
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.900
So we define an array of countries or
a list of strings.

10
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:40.920
And unfortunately, if you're used to JSON,
we don't use that syntax for literals.

11
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.279
We use a constructor
that has the name listOf.

12
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.192
So listOf,
it's actually like in JavaScript,

13
00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:56.618
opening square brackets and
setting the countries, okay, like this.

14
00:00:56.618 --> 00:00:58.894
But here we use listOf.

15
00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:03.717
It's a constructor,
it's a global constructor that returns

16
00:01:03.717 --> 00:01:06.999
a list of the options that you have, okay?

17
00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:10.130
By default a list is immutable.

18
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.980
So after I set the list,
I cannot remove or

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.350
add elements to it unless
I create a mutable list.

20
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.090
That is another type.

21
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.457
So the mutable is list has all the methods
to add, replace, or remove elements.

22
00:01:27.457 --> 00:01:33.840
So you pick when you make a list,
if you want it mutable or unmutable okay?

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.405
We'll have sets, okay?

24
00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:41.937
I said, the difference is that
it cannot contain duplicates.

25
00:01:41.937 --> 00:01:46.357
So in this case, strings will
have three elements because C is

26
00:01:46.357 --> 00:01:51.020
going to be store once only,
and there is no order in a set.

27
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.822
We have a map that is
kind of a dictionary,

28
00:01:54.822 --> 00:01:57.980
like when you have a key and value.

29
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.351
And we also have arrays, and
you say [SOUND] we call it list.

30
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.089
Well, actually, this is for Java.

31
00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:10.320
Sometimes, I mean,
this is actually probably low level.

32
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.944
We're not going to use it today, but
I'm just going to mention that quickly, or

33
00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:18.850
briefly, we mentioned that
the SDK is written in Java.

34
00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.660
So from Kotlin,
when you're talking to the Android SDK,

35
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.040
sometimes you need to
make some conversions.

36
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.120
It's not a big deal, but for
example it happens on lists.

37
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.453
So there is a quick way to
convert the list into an array,

38
00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:40.220
that it's a similar structure,
but it's not exactly the same.

39
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.380
So that's why we need to convert that into
arrays when we are working with the SDK.

40
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.580
Again, not for today, we will stay
within Kotlin today and it will work.

41
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.210
Any question on collections?

42
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.335
&gt;&gt; Did you say one of these
can't have duplicates?

43
00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:58.875
&gt;&gt; The set.

44
00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:02.378
&gt;&gt; The set.
&gt;&gt; The set cannot have duplicates.

45
00:03:02.378 --> 00:03:06.630
Remember the idea of Venn
diagrams from college?

46
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.645
That's a set, so you cannot have two
of the same kind, there is no order.

47
00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:15.540
That happens with sets
on different languages.
