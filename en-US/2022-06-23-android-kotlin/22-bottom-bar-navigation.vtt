1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.330
So what's next?

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.390
We need navigation, we are going to
create the bottom bar navigation.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.613
So we saw when we were building the app,
remember that you can browse using

4
00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:16.390
Ctrl+Click or Cmd+Click, so
I can get into my app here, quickly.

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.260
Going to minimize the emulator.

6
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.510
By the way, should I minimize
the emulator or close it?

7
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.100
So you have close and you have minimize.

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.390
If you minimize the emulator is still
running, which means two things.

9
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.340
Next time you're running again, you're up.

10
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.381
It will be faster, but
also if you're on battery,

11
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:40.300
it will kill your battery in 40 minutes or
an hour.

12
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.680
Because that's an actual Android VM
running behind the scenes.

13
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.477
So if you don't have your power connector,

14
00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:51.520
you may be out of battery even
if you don't see the emulator.

15
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.442
Okay, it's actually hidden.

16
00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:56.360
If you close it, it actually stops the VM.

17
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.300
But next time you run it,
it will take more time.

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.258
So have that in mind.

19
00:01:01.258 --> 00:01:04.480
Okay, so here we have the bottom bar.

20
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.850
So actually in the bottom bar,
we can put anything like a text.

21
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.570
I'm a bottom bar.

22
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.250
And if I build and refresh, the bottom
bar will appear of course at the bottom.

23
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.088
This is the preview

24
00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:25.666
I'm not sure if you can see even see it.

25
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.770
I'm a bottom bar there really small.

26
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.653
So, one of the, let's say restrictions
that we have today in shipped by compose

27
00:01:36.653 --> 00:01:41.947
is that we don't have an automatic
top bar system or navigation system.

28
00:01:41.947 --> 00:01:45.928
We have to design our own, or
we have to use external libraries or

29
00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:47.345
something like that.

30
00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:52.403
So I'm going to create one
really quickly that it's basic,

31
00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.893
but it makes the trick, kay.

32
00:01:54.893 --> 00:02:00.162
So for that, by the way you might
call this already a video on GitHub.

33
00:02:00.162 --> 00:02:05.161
So I'm going to create a new file,
a new Kotlin file.

34
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:08.514
I'm going to call this bottom navigation.

35
00:02:08.514 --> 00:02:12.332
And here I'm gonna put several things.

36
00:02:12.332 --> 00:02:14.340
I'm going to start creating a data class.

37
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.035
Remember data class is just
a simple class that holds data.

38
00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:24.293
And I'm going to call this NavPage or
navigation page that will

39
00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:30.855
contain the name of the page, the icon
can be a title of the page as well.

40
00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:35.777
For the icon I'm going to use an image
vector type I will explain what that is in

41
00:02:35.777 --> 00:02:37.987
a minute and also the route.

42
00:02:37.987 --> 00:02:40.931
And they will face a string as well.

43
00:02:40.931 --> 00:02:44.465
So this is the title of the page.

44
00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:45.941
Let's call it title or name.

45
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:52.315
It's the same and the route is like
an internal name, okay, just that.

46
00:02:52.315 --> 00:02:57.269
And then I'm going to create an object
with all my bases are routes.

47
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.291
Remember an object is an instance
without the class like a JSON object in

48
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:04.203
JavaScript.

49
00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:08.755
And I'm gonna create here different pages,

50
00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:13.902
I will have a MenuPage,
I will have an OffersPage,

51
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:18.470
the OrderPage and also the InfoPage, okay.

52
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.359
I am going to create
the objects from NavPage with

53
00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:27.424
menu icons, where I will get the icons.

54
00:03:27.424 --> 00:03:35.453
Where can import icons check the compose
includes all the material icon gallery.

55
00:03:35.453 --> 00:03:40.014
Material design includes I'm gonna

56
00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:44.580
material.io forward slash icons.

57
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.611
There is a set of hundreds of icons,

58
00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:52.472
free to use, okay.

59
00:03:52.472 --> 00:03:55.423
So, and we can actually use them.

60
00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:57.142
We don't need to borrow them.

61
00:03:57.142 --> 00:03:58.970
We just need to use them.

62
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.742
To define those icons.

63
00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:04.449
We use the global icons object.

64
00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.997
Where we can use outline icons, fill
icons, so there are several collections,

65
00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:14.089
I mean, if it's a circle,
it can be outlined, or filled.

66
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.481
I can use here outline for example,

67
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:24.639
we have a menu we can use menu or
coffee or any icon.

68
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.788
Okay, you can change the icon and
then a route.

69
00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:33.251
So I'm going to we need to import this.

70
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:39.029
I will just do this blah.

71
00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:41.246
I mean, why'd you change here all 4s.

72
00:04:43.624 --> 00:04:48.954
My order info and
then change the icons we have a star,

73
00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:53.810
we can use a star is just
a star shopping card there

74
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.555
is a shopping cart icon and
an info icon, okay.

75
00:04:58.555 --> 00:05:02.500
This is just a data model for
navigation pretty simple.

76
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.823
And then I'm going to create another
array of patients where I have

77
00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:13.540
a list of my patients menu page,
first page, order page and info page.

78
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.000
And by the way, I'm using bar but
maybe I can use bow as well.

79
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.617
Because I'm not mutate in this options,
right.

80
00:05:21.617 --> 00:05:27.536
So, with Alt, Shift, you can
actually even make things like this,

81
00:05:27.536 --> 00:05:33.580
multi cursor and change that with
bar middle weights is just the same.

82
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.390
Okay, make sense?

83
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.420
That's my data model.

84
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.274
Okay, just that.

85
00:05:39.274 --> 00:05:40.946
Now we need to design and

86
00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:46.470
we need to do this manually where each
of the little icon, and the text, okay.

87
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.020
So we need to design the nav items.

88
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.010
So most of the thing that I'm
going to do right now it's similar

89
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.811
to the previous example is putting
a cologne with an image and

90
00:05:58.811 --> 00:06:02.310
a text and setting font properties colors.

91
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.876
So I don't think it worth the time
to do it manually because we

92
00:06:06.876 --> 00:06:09.302
are not learning anything new.

93
00:06:09.302 --> 00:06:14.395
So, something that we can
do is based composable

94
00:06:14.395 --> 00:06:19.250
that renders the image and
the text from here.

95
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.170
I already done this,
this is the bottom navigation.

96
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:26.470
So we are designed in the NavBar.

97
00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.792
So I have here a composable NavBar item.

98
00:06:31.792 --> 00:06:32.720
So let me base these.

99
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.046
It's just this function.

100
00:06:34.046 --> 00:06:41.098
It's not a big deal but
they wanna make better use of our time.

101
00:06:41.098 --> 00:06:44.874
First when I paste this,
I have a lot of errors.

102
00:06:44.874 --> 00:06:45.938
What's going on?

103
00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:51.889
Imports okay import, so
I need to import modifier.

104
00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.529
I need to import alignment
everything needs to be imported.

105
00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:00.243
Sometimes when you're importing,
you have a couple of options, okay.

106
00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:02.801
Be careful if you have a couple of options

107
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:06.799
like in this case to import the one
that says Android x compose.

108
00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:12.169
Because maybe there is another class
in the Android SDK with the same name,

109
00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.165
but it's not the one that we need, okay.

110
00:07:15.165 --> 00:07:18.719
So I will explain what this is,
in a minute.

111
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:25.341
Alternative one, if not,

112
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:29.749
I mean, let's use primary.

113
00:07:34.944 --> 00:07:43.475
We got the size,
text I mean I'm just importing okay.

114
00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:49.122
And this what is this on primary they
the sometimes when we're talking

115
00:07:49.122 --> 00:07:54.397
about colors it's a common situation
to call a color on primary.

116
00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:59.559
What is primary color that goes
on top of a primary background?

117
00:07:59.559 --> 00:08:02.711
We can actually do that if you want like,

118
00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:08.459
in this case we can say that it's the same
as this one because this is dark,

119
00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:12.020
so I want some something
light on top of that.

120
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.552
Okay, so that's on primary.

121
00:08:16.758 --> 00:08:21.408
The right name on capital O, sorry.

122
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:28.240
Now I can import that one and
I can use the same one here.

123
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.990
So let's see what we have here.

124
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.062
It's not so difficult.

125
00:08:31.062 --> 00:08:33.390
So we have a column, an image and a text.

126
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.052
We know the deal there, okay.

127
00:08:35.052 --> 00:08:36.771
So that's important.

128
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:37.990
So what's new?

129
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.900
What's new is we have a color
filter that's for the image.

130
00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:46.650
So the actual icon can be tinted
with the color, make sense?

131
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:51.150
And what I have, I receive a page so
I can render a page.

132
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:52.902
What is the page?

133
00:08:52.902 --> 00:08:57.494
The data class that I have just
created an instance of that class.

134
00:08:57.494 --> 00:09:03.189
Then we have, if it's a letter or not,
and base on that, what I'm doing here,

135
00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:07.372
if it's selected,
it's changing the color of the icon.

136
00:09:07.372 --> 00:09:09.890
If it's the current tab okay,
it doesn't make sense.

137
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.516
That's kind of the idea.

138
00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:12.726
And look at this.

139
00:09:12.726 --> 00:09:16.330
This is probably the part
that needs some attention.

140
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.150
I'm receiving a modifier
of type modifier that is

141
00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:25.750
equals to modifier that
what's going on here?

142
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:28.893
So, this is a composable okay and

143
00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:34.069
not bar item let's make
a preview of that composable.

144
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:38.971
So I'm going to create a preview
of that composable it's going to

145
00:09:38.971 --> 00:09:41.563
read NavBar item preview, okay.

146
00:09:41.563 --> 00:09:44.708
And I'm going to use a NavBar item and

147
00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:49.986
I'm going to pass a patient I'm
going to I can take one of those

148
00:09:49.986 --> 00:09:55.080
patients actually It's routes.MenuPage,
make sense?

149
00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.654
So I can actually preview.

150
00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:06.522
That's how we look like, okay?

151
00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:07.800
Fine, right?

152
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:14.938
So what if I wanna apply
Padding to my NavBar item.

153
00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:19.310
If you remember padding are being
defined by modifiers, right?

154
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.580
But this is my own composable.

155
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.612
Makes sense?

156
00:10:24.612 --> 00:10:29.110
So by default my own composer,
we're gonna remove that for a minute.

157
00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.153
My own composable does
not contain modifiers,

158
00:10:34.153 --> 00:10:37.310
does not contain modifiers.

159
00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:42.621
If I want modifiers,
I need to accept that were

160
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:48.350
in the function signature,
is of type modifier.

161
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:51.190
And this is actually
a default modifier there.

162
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.973
So the same name,
the same name of the type,

163
00:10:53.973 --> 00:10:57.147
it's a default one that is doing nothing,
okay.

164
00:10:57.147 --> 00:10:59.729
So then is if I don't say equals,

165
00:10:59.729 --> 00:11:04.450
now I'm forced to pass a modifier
to my function every time.

166
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:07.864
If you don't want to force the user,
then you use this.

167
00:11:07.864 --> 00:11:11.230
I have an ID error.

168
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.525
Okay, so that means that if
a now that modifier can add for

169
00:11:15.525 --> 00:11:20.194
example, the padding and
who is going to apply this padding?

170
00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:23.929
Well actually depends on us.

171
00:11:23.929 --> 00:11:28.449
I am applying this modifier to the column.

172
00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:32.161
Typically when we're receiving
modifiers and arguments.

173
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:36.908
We reapply that modifier to
the root element that we have

174
00:11:36.908 --> 00:11:40.754
the root composable in
this case the column.

175
00:11:40.754 --> 00:11:44.573
So if I'm passing the padding from
here I'm taking that padding and

176
00:11:44.573 --> 00:11:48.734
passing that padding to the column
does it make sense in the composition.

177
00:11:48.734 --> 00:11:54.870
We're actually putting that
padding in our case in the column.

178
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:57.047
Does it make sense?

179
00:11:57.047 --> 00:11:58.717
So that's actually a NavBar item.

180
00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:02.846
Let me push this.

181
00:12:02.846 --> 00:12:06.960
&gt;&gt; So is it overrun your eight?

182
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.652
Is that what it is?
It's your 12.

183
00:12:07.652 --> 00:12:08.816
So you have 12, I'm 46.

184
00:12:08.816 --> 00:12:11.810
&gt;&gt; No in this case,
it's going to apply both.

185
00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:16.235
Because my modifier has the ADP.

186
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.520
But let me go meet first, and then.

187
00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.336
So you have the code here.

188
00:12:24.336 --> 00:12:25.238
So my.

189
00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.974
I'm applying to the column this modifier?

190
00:12:32.974 --> 00:12:34.581
It will lowercase m.

191
00:12:34.581 --> 00:12:37.209
So it's actually this one.

192
00:12:37.209 --> 00:12:41.259
So it comes with a padding of ADP.

193
00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:46.543
And then I'm applying another
pine padding of 12 db.

194
00:12:46.543 --> 00:12:49.531
So it's going to apply both.

195
00:12:49.531 --> 00:12:51.264
Yeah, maybe I don't want that.

196
00:12:51.264 --> 00:12:54.830
I don't know, okay.
But it's just an example on the preview.

197
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:59.519
So this is how you can provide your
own modifiers to your own composer

198
00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:01.584
when you receive a modifier.

199
00:13:01.584 --> 00:13:06.330
And you need to reapply that into
some of your compostables some of

200
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.022
your elements that you have inside.

201
00:13:09.022 --> 00:13:11.101
That's it makes sense.

202
00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:13.789
Any questions at this point?

203
00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:17.130
&gt;&gt; Why would you apply both?

204
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.247
&gt;&gt; Because when it's for
the preview, for example, and

205
00:13:20.247 --> 00:13:22.550
I want the preview to have more padding,

206
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:26.850
because I'm simulating how this is
going to appear later somewhere else.

207
00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.547
This is just the preview.

208
00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:31.550
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you.

209
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:36.333
&gt;&gt; When you say it's gonna play both of
them it's gonna be 20 DP or is it gonna?

210
00:13:36.333 --> 00:13:38.320
&gt;&gt; Well in this case,
this is only for horizontal.

211
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:44.239
So horizontal you will have yeah, it
will have a 20 and then eight and eight.

212
00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:49.055
Remember that when you're using
modifiers let me pull this like this.

213
00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:51.070
You can actually.

214
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:58.490
Apply more than one padding,
you can modify.

215
00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.348
What it's doing it
depends on the modifier.

216
00:14:01.348 --> 00:14:02.701
Okay, what's it gonna do?

217
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:05.514
In this case,
it's not like making a padding of 20.

218
00:14:05.514 --> 00:14:11.210
It first makes another with 12 and
another with 8 more.

219
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.197
That's how it works.

220
00:14:13.197 --> 00:14:16.582
&gt;&gt; So this is the only way to pass pass or
you passing one but

221
00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:19.685
then you applying another ones,
right, I mean.

222
00:14:19.685 --> 00:14:24.219
&gt;&gt; It's yeah, it's a way that you
have to define modifiers outside and

223
00:14:24.219 --> 00:14:28.771
apply them inside your receive them
as an argument in your function.

224
00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:31.792
Remember, we're just a function.

225
00:14:31.792 --> 00:14:32.780
Just remember that okay.
