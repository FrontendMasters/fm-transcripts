1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.810
So now, title and
description are just hard coded.

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.296
So something that they can do
is to receive the title and

3
00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:17.501
the message or
description as an argument, right?

4
00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:24.780
So instead of being hard coded My Title,
I'm going to use the title.

5
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.227
And for Description,
you should use description, make sense?

6
00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:33.050
Because I want that offer to be
dynamic to different offers.

7
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.010
But at this point, we have a problem.

8
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.340
The problem is that the preview
is not working anymore.

9
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.180
Can you understand why or do you get the
idea of why the preview is not working?

10
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.036
It's giving me an error, it's red.

11
00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:52.950
&gt;&gt; You're not setting those
description titles inside those?

12
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.365
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we have a variable,
because now we need some arguments.

13
00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:04.870
So to preview in its arguments, it doesn't
know where to get these arguments from.

14
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.325
So there are two ways to solve
the problem, let's say the best way,

15
00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:17.000
but the most complicated one,
and the hacky and quick one.

16
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.577
Because we have only one day, we're
going to use the hacky and quick one.

17
00:01:21.577 --> 00:01:24.356
But it's okay, I mean,
it's not really so hacky.

18
00:01:24.356 --> 00:01:26.140
It's fine.

19
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.763
The thing is that we can
create composables like this,

20
00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:32.220
we can create preview composables.

21
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.986
And to actually make sure that
no one is going to use this,

22
00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:39.580
we can mark this as private.

23
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.882
And we can create a composable just for
the preview and

24
00:01:41.882 --> 00:01:48.242
we're going to compose an Offer,
With the properties set.

25
00:01:53.554 --> 00:01:54.890
Okay, does it make sense?

26
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.550
Now, I need the iComposable,
I forgot the iComposable.

27
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.120
So I don't need to actually
preview exactly what I want.

28
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.663
So I don't need to preview
the composable that I want to preview.

29
00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:13.420
I can preview anything I want.

30
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.156
So I can create composables just for
the preview, As I did there.

31
00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:21.520
Does it make sense?

32
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.284
So I did this private, so

33
00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:28.333
no one from the outside of this file
will actually use that composable.

34
00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:33.493
Because it's just a preview,
it wasn't actually intended for usage.

35
00:02:33.493 --> 00:02:35.728
Does it make sense?

36
00:02:35.728 --> 00:02:38.440
So it is hacky, but not too hacky.

37
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.978
There are other ways where you can set a
class that will provide default values for

38
00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:45.702
your previews and so on.

39
00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:49.514
But it gets more complicated, and
I think that it's probably too much for

40
00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:51.802
the first day of coding
in Jetpack Compose.

41
00:02:51.802 --> 00:02:54.316
This one is better, okay?

42
00:02:54.316 --> 00:02:55.335
Do you have any question on that?

43
00:02:57.435 --> 00:03:00.405
So you can make the previews
as complicated as you want.

44
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.786
So what if I wanted padding
around the whole thing?

45
00:03:08.786 --> 00:03:13.804
Because the final goal of
this file is to create

46
00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:19.596
another preview composable
with the name OffersPage

47
00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:24.109
that will render several offers, okay?

48
00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.080
And for that I'm going to create
a column with offers, and

49
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.320
I have two offers for you.

50
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.172
In fact, I think if you want,
you can even copy and paste it from there.

51
00:03:37.172 --> 00:03:40.711
It's just text,
the title is not a big deal anyway.

52
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:45.490
So this is the offers section,
I think at the bottom.

53
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.330
Yeah, you have two offers here, Like that.

54
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.520
What if you want to test now this?

55
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:02.740
Well, it has a preview, so I can actually
preview several at the same time.

56
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.650
This preview has no background.

57
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.273
And even if I want,
you can just comment this one for now.

58
00:04:10.273 --> 00:04:13.965
So I will just keep previewing
just the OffersPage.

59
00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:27.608
So I have several,
Preview is out of date, Build &amp; Refresh.

60
00:04:29.777 --> 00:04:31.131
I have several previews here.

61
00:04:31.131 --> 00:04:36.001
But as you can see, this doesn't
look exactly as I was expecting.

62
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.813
So first, Let me try the Interactive Mode.

63
00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:51.200
With Interactive Mode, you can
actually scroll and see what happens.

64
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.470
And it doesn't scroll.

65
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:53.709
I mean, maybe it's not so bad.

66
00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:59.708
But if I add a third one, Remember

67
00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:05.300
interactive is that little icon
there that lets you scroll.

68
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.980
Well, it doesn't scroll.

69
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.525
By default, the column is not scrollable.

70
00:05:11.525 --> 00:05:15.330
You can make it a scrollable, if you want.

71
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.560
Do you understand
the problem that we have?

72
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.010
So that offer is not a scrollable.

73
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.140
How to make this scroll?

74
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.529
There are many ways to do this, okay?

75
00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:27.489
So there is another component,

76
00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:30.981
there are other components
that are scrollable, okay?

77
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:33.148
So we can use those if we want to.

78
00:05:33.148 --> 00:05:38.630
But if you want to work with that,
the column has a modifier.

79
00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.820
So we apply, not focusModifier,
we say scrollable.

80
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.330
And we need to pass a variable that
will remember the ScrollState.

81
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:53.359
And look at the scrollable.

82
00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:54.995
Remember I mentioned,

83
00:05:54.995 --> 00:06:00.210
sometimes you need to import just
one part of the declaration.

84
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:07.320
This is because that's probably,
An extension function.

85
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.123
So it's the extension function that
applies that the scrollable modifier is in

86
00:06:12.123 --> 00:06:13.900
another file.

87
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:20.902
And I think, yeah, I'm,
I need to close that one, yeah.

88
00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:24.457
Okay, so that will add,

89
00:06:27.901 --> 00:06:35.145
It says no, I didn't because, Instead of
a scrollable, I can use verticalScroll.

90
00:06:38.772 --> 00:06:42.200
If not, I can use a scrollable and
pass the orientation as an argument.

91
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.330
It's just the same, refresh.

92
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.510
Okay, so now I'm in Interactive Mode.

93
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.399
And you can see, I can scroll.

94
00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:56.288
However, it looks terrible, okay?

95
00:06:56.288 --> 00:07:00.480
First, what about my second offer?

96
00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.300
Why it's not centered?

97
00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.293
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; It's not actually taking

98
00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:06.988
the whole width.

99
00:07:06.988 --> 00:07:14.273
And because the text is narrow,
it's not pushing the limits.

100
00:07:14.273 --> 00:07:20.626
So we need to actually go to our Offer and
say okay, maybe we need to go,

101
00:07:20.626 --> 00:07:26.362
for example, to the column here and
change another modifier.

102
00:07:26.362 --> 00:07:32.420
And we can say that we wanna
fill the MaxWidth, right?

103
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.170
Make sense?

104
00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.158
So if I refresh, Now it's better.

105
00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:43.870
Okay, because I'm filling the MaxWidth.

106
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.764
But this is still not
exactly what I wanted.

107
00:07:49.054 --> 00:07:53.540
So I mean,
the image is still weird, right?

108
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.364
So the image is still getting
out of its boundaries.

109
00:07:58.364 --> 00:07:59.800
Does it make sense?

110
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.330
So it's like,
I don't think I want this like this.

111
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:08.258
Well actually, to solve the problem,

112
00:08:08.258 --> 00:08:12.607
it's actually better to instead
of defining the image and

113
00:08:12.607 --> 00:08:17.770
the column directly as global elements,
we can use one called a box.

114
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.270
What is a box?

115
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:26.354
Similar to a div in HTML,
with the difference that everything

116
00:08:26.354 --> 00:08:33.024
you put inside the box will just go
as layer on the same place, okay?

117
00:08:33.024 --> 00:08:34.186
It's just that.

118
00:08:34.186 --> 00:08:37.820
It's just a layer, one over the other.

119
00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.722
So if you look at the example,
I think it should be here somewhere.

120
00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:46.007
Yeah, the example that you have
here in the Offer section,

121
00:08:46.007 --> 00:08:47.527
it's actually like that.

122
00:08:47.527 --> 00:08:52.130
It has the box as a wrapper, okay?

123
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:59.680
So for example, that's the advantage
of composables, it's just a function.

124
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.536
So if you try this,
it's probably the same thing.

125
00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:10.620
But if you try this, paste, rebuild,
This one doesn't have the right color.

126
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.442
Let me change that quickly,
it was the Alternative2.

127
00:09:21.698 --> 00:09:27.226
I show you by pasting this,
I just want to show you quickly,

128
00:09:27.226 --> 00:09:33.105
how easy it is to replace views and
make it work quickly, okay?
