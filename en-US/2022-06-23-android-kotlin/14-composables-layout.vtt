1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.687
Okay, so now that we know some basics,
or some ideas,

2
00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:08.680
let's look here again of what we have.

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.245
First, main activity is
something that we need that

4
00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.243
because we are an Android application, and

5
00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:21.090
we won't have anything on the screen on an
Android application without an activity.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.888
But we don't wanna touch this a lot,
but that's a class, and

7
00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:29.578
I promise you that we're not going to
use OOP yellow to check back and forth.

8
00:00:29.578 --> 00:00:36.214
So this is the class is there, we're going
to change what we wanna run there, and

9
00:00:36.214 --> 00:00:42.672
everything will be greater in a different
place with a different idea, okay?

10
00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:46.110
And everything that we're going to
create it's called a composable.

11
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.400
So actually, I'm going to delete this for
a minute, the greeting and everything.

12
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.860
And now, I don't have a preview.

13
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.250
It says, No Preview found, okay?

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.490
Which is okay, for now, I'm okay.

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.850
I'm going to just clean this file.

16
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.840
I'm still in the same main
activity calling file.

17
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.470
But I'm going to show you,
what's a composable.

18
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.750
So a composable as I mentioned before,
it's actually a UI component.

19
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.550
Something that we put on the screen.

20
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.170
That's called a composable,
in jetpack compose.

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560
What is a composable function?

22
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.300
So fun, and the name of the composable,
this is going to be my first composable.

23
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.610
A composable we use title case.

24
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.370
Okay, we use title case.

25
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.810
So how does it know that is a composer and
not just a normal function, so

26
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.141
that we're going to compose
UI with this function.

27
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:44.791
We need to annotate this
function without composable.

28
00:01:44.791 --> 00:01:49.813
So we are @composable before
the function declaration, typically this

29
00:01:49.813 --> 00:01:55.168
can go on the same line as well but the
most common situation is to use two lines.

30
00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:57.756
Okay, but it's actually decorating or

31
00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:02.610
annotating the function declaration okay,
does it makes sense.

32
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.511
So, if you have a function, so

33
00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:09.415
this is that when we were saying that this
is similar to react, this is similar to

34
00:02:09.415 --> 00:02:15.060
function based components in react when we
are doing functions in react these days.

35
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:22.088
So, here we have the same idea, in UI
component, a composable is a function,

36
00:02:22.088 --> 00:02:27.500
that function inside will
emit other composers.

37
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.570
For example, the one that I put
before a text is a composable.

38
00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.520
How do I know if it's a composable?

39
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:40.550
Because you can see here that it says that
text is a function with @composable, okay.

40
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.377
So the text is a built in
composable in the framework,

41
00:02:45.377 --> 00:02:49.710
that will receive a text as a string,
okay.

42
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.360
Hello, jetpack composer, like so.

43
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.770
So, look at this,
I already used a text before.

44
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.010
Here, I have another version.

45
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.391
Why do you feel that,
here it says text equals and

46
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:06.873
I didn't have text equals before?

47
00:03:09.242 --> 00:03:09.742
Does anyone know?

48
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.200
Because of the label.

49
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.806
So here I didn't name the argument and
here when I picked from the order

50
00:03:18.806 --> 00:03:24.580
complete, I press Return or
Enter it order completes the name.

51
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.230
But if you don't want the name,
you can remove it.

52
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.672
This is just your decision I remember it,
it changes to the hint, is your decision

53
00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:38.350
if you wanna name or not the arguments
because these are just functions.

54
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.160
Okay, it makes sense.

55
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.410
So now I'm not seeing any preview
can I preview this composable,

56
00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.968
I need to add another annotation
it's add preview, if you add another

57
00:03:49.968 --> 00:03:54.470
annotation now, the preview will
appear I need to build on refresh.

58
00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.620
So it's building and now I can see Hello
jetpack compose, if it's too large,

59
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.970
you can scroll also it's actually
pretty bad but anyway, you can hit fit.

60
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.049
And by default,
the preview does not paint the background.

61
00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.856
So here's a transparent background,

62
00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:20.966
if you want the preview annotation
has some properties that I can pass.

63
00:04:20.966 --> 00:04:27.639
It's a function actually and
I can say show background true,

64
00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.323
so now I have the background in
the preview okay, make sense?

65
00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:37.300
So can I make other composable?

66
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.770
Yeah, as many as I want in the same file.

67
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.030
And that's a UI component that
I can put anywhere in my app.

68
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.440
So as you can see,
this is pretty simple functions.

69
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.810
That are publishing content,
what if I add another one here?

70
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.850
What if I copy this and paste it like
this and this is my second composable?

71
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.480
What if I have two previews?

72
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.720
If I build and refresh, I will see both, I
have two previews, just separate previews.

73
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.679
In fact, the preview and
shine is really powerful,

74
00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:19.090
I can have more than one
preview to the same composable.

75
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.991
And for example, in this one, I can change
some other property of the preview,

76
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:26.510
such as the width of the canvas.

77
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:33.479
So I wanna see how it looks like
if it's 200, so I have the both.

78
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:41.410
The same component but
rendered in a 200 DP container.

79
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.420
Remember DP is like pixels, but
independent from the resolution.

80
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.278
It's similar to PXs and CSs actually.

81
00:05:49.793 --> 00:05:52.703
Okay, so
you pick what do you wanna preview?

82
00:05:52.703 --> 00:05:56.460
Every time you have a preview,
this is new.

83
00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.520
We have that little icon there,
can you see that one?

84
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.630
It's a phone with a with a play button.

85
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.121
If you click there, it's going to run
only this composable in the emulator, or

86
00:06:09.121 --> 00:06:12.204
on your real phone if you have
a real phone connected and

87
00:06:12.204 --> 00:06:14.860
we will talk about that later.

88
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.370
So if I run this, is not going to
run the whole app on the phone.

89
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.650
Just that composable, okay?

90
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.099
So you think I do have the emulator here,

91
00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.472
and it's not running so
I need to wait for it to run.

92
00:06:32.506 --> 00:06:37.810
Waiting, you can see at the bottom it
says waiting for targets to come online.

93
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.610
If it's not becoming automatically
in sometimes it happens.

94
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.402
Maybe it's a good idea to
just run the whole app.

95
00:06:46.988 --> 00:06:53.933
So the emulator appears, and
then run the composable again.

96
00:07:00.882 --> 00:07:02.555
Let's try again.

97
00:07:05.075 --> 00:07:11.860
I know what's going on, look at this,
interesting that it happened.

98
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.910
So it says running devices,
it's actually running.

99
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.900
It's actually running
this in my real phone.

100
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.990
In my real pixel that I don't even
have with me it's in my backpack.

101
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.523
But because it's in the same WI-FI,
I have a Wireless Connector.

102
00:07:30.523 --> 00:07:35.169
Well this connection with my phone and
that way it was actually running there.

103
00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.811
Okay, so what I'm going to change
that here from the selector to one of

104
00:07:38.811 --> 00:07:44.875
the emulators And
run it again, stop and rerun.

105
00:07:44.875 --> 00:07:46.397
Now the emulator is coming.

106
00:07:50.974 --> 00:07:53.337
It goes through the whole
OS as you can see.

107
00:07:55.061 --> 00:08:00.519
So the emulator is running now,
see if I can run composable.

108
00:08:10.328 --> 00:08:17.039
So if I try to run the composable, It's
a start in the emulator from the scratch.

109
00:08:24.843 --> 00:08:30.029
And now we can see only that widget.

110
00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:36.650
So then I can test on real devices on or
emulators each composable individually.
