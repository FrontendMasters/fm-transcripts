1
00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:07.322
Okay, so this is one item, now we need for
the NavBar all the items, okay?

2
00:00:07.322 --> 00:00:08.857
So, let's do that.

3
00:00:08.857 --> 00:00:16.084
So, I'm going to create a preview,
composable, I'm going to call that NavBar.

4
00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:20.009
And for that, well,
I'm going to use a row, y row.

5
00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:24.305
Because, I want them horizontally, okay?

6
00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:25.398
So, it's a row.

7
00:00:25.398 --> 00:00:28.254
Inside the row, I'm going to use a for.

8
00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:29.839
Can I do a for?

9
00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.612
Yeah, okay.

10
00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:37.923
For each page in Routes.pages,
and what is that?

11
00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:40.804
The array, the list I created before.

12
00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:45.614
So, I'm going to loop through all these
pages that each has something that I have

13
00:00:45.614 --> 00:00:46.544
just created.

14
00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.146
And I'm going to render
one nav item per page.

15
00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:52.812
Does it makes sense?

16
00:00:52.812 --> 00:00:55.835
So, here I'm going to
render one NavBar item.

17
00:00:55.835 --> 00:00:57.976
Which page?

18
00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:59.496
The current page, okay?

19
00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:03.328
I will need the argument name,
if it's the same,

20
00:01:03.328 --> 00:01:07.813
maybe it's up to you,
if you want to keep it, it's fine.

21
00:01:07.813 --> 00:01:12.563
It's not a problem and
then if it's selected or not.

22
00:01:12.563 --> 00:01:19.163
So, I can just say, well let's not add the
selected for now, we can add that later.

23
00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:24.779
So, we have NavBar right down,
and I think for

24
00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:29.677
now should be good enough to render bar.

25
00:01:29.677 --> 00:01:33.901
Look at that at the bottom,

26
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:37.581
it seems fine, right?

27
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:41.823
So, I'm just looping through and
rendering these items.

28
00:01:41.823 --> 00:01:43.216
But I need to behavior as well.

29
00:01:43.216 --> 00:01:49.856
So, I need to click on each item and
somehow change content.

30
00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:52.633
We don't have any automatic
behavior on checkbox on both.

31
00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:57.459
So, we need to do this manually,
but it's not so complicated.

32
00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.850
So, one simple way is that
maybe we can receive here,

33
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.251
what is the selected route,
but it's just a string.

34
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:11.359
And we can save that by default,
we start with a menu page.

35
00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:18.056
Okay?
So, with that in mind, I can say selected,

36
00:02:18.056 --> 00:02:24.968
anyway selected is a Boolean number
we're seeing here is equals to,

37
00:02:24.968 --> 00:02:32.378
if the route is equals to the current
route that I'm actually rendering.

38
00:02:32.378 --> 00:02:34.955
So, let me do things like like this.

39
00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:37.575
So, I'm rendering each item and

40
00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:42.162
I'm verifying if the current
one is the selected one, and

41
00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:46.479
we're going to receive that
from the outside, okay?

42
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:47.446
Make sense?

43
00:02:47.446 --> 00:02:50.571
Now the preview is broken again.

44
00:02:50.571 --> 00:02:51.395
Why?

45
00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:52.149
Because I need to pass arguments.

46
00:02:54.486 --> 00:03:00.019
Okay.
So, it may have problems later.

47
00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.177
But remember that we can create our own
composable shots for preview, okay?

48
00:03:05.177 --> 00:03:08.073
So, now that I'm here, what's next?

49
00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:11.422
I need to click on items.

50
00:03:11.422 --> 00:03:14.508
So how does that work?

51
00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:19.559
We can apply a modifier, this is the first
time we are doing a click, okay?

52
00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:26.442
So, it's through modifiers and
the modifier is known as clickable.

53
00:03:26.442 --> 00:03:31.653
Is not on click is not using
the on prefix, clickable.

54
00:03:31.653 --> 00:03:37.149
And here we do something
What do I need to do?

55
00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:38.588
If you click here.

56
00:03:38.588 --> 00:03:39.796
&gt;&gt; As a function?

57
00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:45.004
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so first I need to change
the section that's kind of the deal.

58
00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:50.647
But if we are receiving the route
from the outside selected route,

59
00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:53.669
it feels like the source of truth for

60
00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:58.129
the carbon route is not here,
it's not in a number.

61
00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.817
It's somewhere top in the composition,
maybe in the app,

62
00:04:02.817 --> 00:04:05.084
the app knows where you are.

63
00:04:05.084 --> 00:04:08.864
So, in that case, as you mentioned,

64
00:04:08.864 --> 00:04:14.073
we might wanna receive
a callback function, okay?

65
00:04:14.073 --> 00:04:20.841
So, how would you create a callback
if just lambda expression.

66
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:25.607
On change, changeable q1.

67
00:04:25.607 --> 00:04:27.350
And what's the type?

68
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.593
It's a function that receives what?

69
00:04:31.593 --> 00:04:33.413
A route, maybe.

70
00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:40.083
[INAUDIBLE] That's the name of our and
returns nothing.

71
00:04:40.083 --> 00:04:45.871
Does anyone remember the boys
type in Kotlin for Android?

72
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:46.754
Unit.

73
00:04:46.754 --> 00:04:47.786
&gt;&gt; Unit yeah.

74
00:04:47.786 --> 00:04:53.161
&gt;&gt; Unit, so meaning that if it's
clickable I'm going to call on change

75
00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:58.086
passing as an argument that
the current route somehow, okay?

76
00:04:58.086 --> 00:05:03.145
For example,
I can only pass a string maybe it's faster

77
00:05:03.145 --> 00:05:07.892
instead of passing the whole page,
shorter route.

78
00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:12.234
I think that will be faster.

79
00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:16.630
So, now the preview is broken,
which is expectable, okay?

80
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.711
At this point.

81
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:18.630
Why?

82
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.829
Because it needs unknown change.

83
00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:24.685
It seems complicated, okay?

84
00:05:24.685 --> 00:05:25.691
Which is okay.

85
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:27.149
You can delete the preview if you want.

86
00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:31.319
If you're happy with that, you can just
delete the preview of the NavBar and

87
00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:33.876
just keep the preview
that you want a preview.

88
00:05:33.876 --> 00:05:36.084
You don't need to preview everything.

89
00:05:36.084 --> 00:05:39.738
You're not forced mentally
to preview anything, okay?

90
00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:43.286
Or all the things that you have,
pick your home previews.

91
00:05:43.286 --> 00:05:44.832
Okay.

92
00:05:44.832 --> 00:05:48.621
So, any question?

93
00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:50.885
You might have right now?

94
00:05:50.885 --> 00:05:51.705
No?

95
00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:58.466
The next part is to actually go to
the app and apply that to the bottom bar.

96
00:05:58.466 --> 00:06:02.410
So to the bottom bar, I don't want text.

97
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.570
I want to apply the navbar
that I have just created and

98
00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.389
I need to pass something
in the unchanged event.

99
00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.501
And that's the closure,
a lambda expression.

100
00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:17.812
Makes sense?

101
00:06:17.812 --> 00:06:24.003
So, when the NavBar changes we're
going to receive here in it.

102
00:06:24.003 --> 00:06:25.173
What's it?

103
00:06:25.173 --> 00:06:30.318
The route that the user is clicking on it,
okay?

104
00:06:30.318 --> 00:06:38.034
So, now here comes the part when we
need to set the state of the app.

105
00:06:38.034 --> 00:06:41.493
So, the current selected items,
selected tab, selected page,

106
00:06:41.493 --> 00:06:42.869
call it however you want.

107
00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:47.893
It's actually in a state of the app
because it's changing and I need to

108
00:06:47.893 --> 00:06:53.614
re-render the content every time the user
is changing the current selection.

109
00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:55.315
Does it make sense?

110
00:06:55.315 --> 00:07:00.301
So that means that I need
a variable of type of state.

111
00:07:00.301 --> 00:07:04.169
So, it's the current you can
call it however you want,

112
00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:09.110
the current index, current element,
current page, current route,

113
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.924
selected route, something like that.

114
00:07:11.924 --> 00:07:16.244
And we need to call,
remember it's always the same,

115
00:07:16.244 --> 00:07:20.575
we're going to remember
a mutable state of a string.

116
00:07:20.575 --> 00:07:27.450
And we are going to start with,
for example, the menu.

117
00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:31.847
Now it was routes.menuPage.route.

118
00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:33.229
So we start with that one.

119
00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:34.040
That's the initial state.

120
00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:44.041
And when it's changing,
it's actually changing.

121
00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:48.261
So, like the route, the new value is it.

122
00:07:48.261 --> 00:07:54.260
If you don't like it remember we
can change that like the new route.

123
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.205
We can call it new route.

124
00:07:57.205 --> 00:08:01.646
Does it make more sense
with new route than it?

125
00:08:01.646 --> 00:08:02.575
So, we are changing the state.

126
00:08:05.288 --> 00:08:13.103
What I'm missing here is that NavBar
receives an option I'll select the route.

127
00:08:13.103 --> 00:08:18.530
That is the value that I'm just mutating.

128
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.662
This is called state hosting.

129
00:08:24.662 --> 00:08:30.912
A state hosting is when you have a
composable that receives one variable and

130
00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:35.784
since also the value change
through a lambda expression.

131
00:08:35.784 --> 00:08:38.864
This is called a state hosting.

132
00:08:38.864 --> 00:08:44.792
We're saving the state,
not here in the number, but one level up.

133
00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:47.080
This is state hoisting.

134
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:51.524
In fact, the text field is
actually using this technique.

135
00:08:51.524 --> 00:08:55.363
When we're setting the text field
we also have the same idea.

136
00:08:55.363 --> 00:08:59.622
So, let's see what happens.

137
00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:04.884
First, I can try to see
what's going on here.

138
00:09:04.884 --> 00:09:11.095
Well, if you look at the bottom,
we have something there,

139
00:09:11.095 --> 00:09:14.832
it's still a little weird, okay?

140
00:09:14.832 --> 00:09:21.601
So, you can see there in terms of
the background, and all that thing.

141
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:24.625
So, let's run this on a real phone.

142
00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.749
Look at the bottom.

143
00:09:28.749 --> 00:09:35.172
Yes, kind of, we need to add some more
things but it has to do with the UI.

144
00:09:35.172 --> 00:09:38.050
what do we need, to do two things.

145
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.442
First, change the background color and

146
00:09:41.442 --> 00:09:45.739
also maybe stretch that
number to the whole width.

147
00:09:45.739 --> 00:09:47.716
So where?

148
00:09:47.716 --> 00:09:50.481
In the NavBar.

149
00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:52.793
Make sense?

150
00:09:52.793 --> 00:09:59.199
So, in the NavBar in this row,
I'm going to apply some modifiers.

151
00:09:59.199 --> 00:10:06.159
So modifier equals to, for example
changing the background color to primary.

152
00:10:06.159 --> 00:10:09.994
We can take it from the material theme,

153
00:10:09.994 --> 00:10:15.817
the primary is actually the one
that defines also the top bar

154
00:10:18.996 --> 00:10:21.669
Colors primary.

155
00:10:21.669 --> 00:10:23.253
That's one modifier.

156
00:10:23.253 --> 00:10:27.120
And the other one it's fillMaxWidth.

157
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.059
Because I want the whole row to take
the whole width that we're having in

158
00:10:31.059 --> 00:10:31.724
the space.

159
00:10:31.724 --> 00:10:34.014
&gt;&gt; The images won't get stretched now.

160
00:10:34.014 --> 00:10:34.776
&gt;&gt; Sorry, what?

161
00:10:34.776 --> 00:10:37.902
&gt;&gt; The images won't get stretched
&gt;&gt; If it's an image,

162
00:10:37.902 --> 00:10:41.777
you can change the aspect
ratio that you wanna use.

163
00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:47.729
If you remember we did that on,
offers page.

164
00:10:47.729 --> 00:10:52.195
When we were putting an image here,
we change the content scale.

165
00:10:52.195 --> 00:10:57.920
So, here you can change,
how do you want that image to be stretch.

166
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.486
If fill or crop, okay?

167
00:10:59.486 --> 00:11:05.513
So, you just change this property with all
the enum values that you have available.

168
00:11:05.513 --> 00:11:08.733
&gt;&gt; Okay,
do you have padding in between them and

169
00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:12.479
just do we have padding to
be able to be stretched?.

170
00:11:12.479 --> 00:11:14.459
&gt;&gt; You have padding in everything.

171
00:11:14.459 --> 00:11:17.147
[FOREIGN]
&gt;&gt; So any mesh is a composable.

172
00:11:17.147 --> 00:11:19.832
&gt;&gt; So forget about the emesh as the file.

173
00:11:19.832 --> 00:11:24.008
It's a composable that renders
on the machine side, okay?

174
00:11:24.008 --> 00:11:25.012
Makes sense?

175
00:11:25.012 --> 00:11:26.023
Cool.

176
00:11:26.023 --> 00:11:32.743
Well let's see,
if I run this now look at the bottom.

177
00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:34.755
We're still missing some parts, right?

178
00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:39.297
So, what do we need,
I mean it's better than before, but

179
00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:42.835
it's still not what I was expecting, okay?

180
00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:47.839
So, I need more paddings and
also it's not actually stretching.

181
00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:52.271
So, we need to find which
one are we missing.

182
00:11:52.271 --> 00:11:53.383
Let's see.

183
00:11:53.383 --> 00:11:58.478
So, let's go to bottom navigation,

184
00:11:58.478 --> 00:12:03.104
like here, let me go to code only.

185
00:12:03.104 --> 00:12:04.478
So, this is a row.

186
00:12:04.478 --> 00:12:08.795
Okay, the row is filling the max width,
but we might have a problem here.

187
00:12:08.795 --> 00:12:09.687
So, it's okay.

188
00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.958
We are filling the max width, but

189
00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:16.110
the row is just putting all
the elements one after the other.

190
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.024
It's not aligning
the elements along the row.

191
00:12:20.024 --> 00:12:21.734
Does it make sense?

192
00:12:21.734 --> 00:12:24.220
So we need to change more properties.

193
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:29.063
One of the properties that
we can change is horizontal.

194
00:12:29.063 --> 00:12:31.586
So there are many properties.

195
00:12:31.586 --> 00:12:32.601
Okay, that [INAUDIBLE].

196
00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:36.188
Unfortunately, sometimes the IDE is
not showing you all the properties.

197
00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:38.287
And when you look at the autocomplete,

198
00:12:38.287 --> 00:12:42.562
sometimes it's giving you even more
properties that the ones that you can use.

199
00:12:42.562 --> 00:12:46.814
And if you pick one of these, these
are not actually from Jetpack compose.

200
00:12:46.814 --> 00:12:52.672
So, be careful because not everything
that appears here is what you want.

201
00:12:52.672 --> 00:12:57.116
You can also get into the row and
try to see there there, for example,

202
00:12:57.116 --> 00:12:59.425
we have a horizontal arrangement.

203
00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:00.678
Remember you enter with ctrl click.

204
00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:05.088
And you get into that function and
you see the properties,

205
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:07.338
in case the IV is not helping.

206
00:13:07.338 --> 00:13:11.555
So and in this case,
arrangement can be, for example,

207
00:13:11.555 --> 00:13:15.256
in space around the space
even in space between.

208
00:13:15.256 --> 00:13:18.723
And if we do this,
we're missing the parenthesis?

209
00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:24.788
Now, I'm asking the row to actually
put the spaces between elements so

210
00:13:24.788 --> 00:13:27.123
they can fit on the screen.

211
00:13:27.123 --> 00:13:34.993
And also between we can use a space around
that also add spaces at both pages, okay?

212
00:13:34.993 --> 00:13:36.893
And also in the middle.

213
00:13:36.893 --> 00:13:40.268
So, you can play with this value.

214
00:13:40.268 --> 00:13:45.750
And just because I'm here maybe
I want the padding as well for

215
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.850
the whole row that renders the icons,
okay?

216
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:53.532
And it's like what's going on,
how to solve the problem?

217
00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:55.588
So what's the problem we have?

218
00:13:55.588 --> 00:13:56.727
&gt;&gt; On the bottom padding.

219
00:13:56.727 --> 00:13:59.109
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Well, the padding, should be moved up.

220
00:13:59.109 --> 00:14:01.749
&gt;&gt; The padding should we moved up or
the background or down?

221
00:14:05.185 --> 00:14:08.014
So, I'm applying the padding and
then the background color.

222
00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:12.070
But if I swap the order,
background first, padding later.

223
00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:21.062
Okay, it looks better.

224
00:14:21.062 --> 00:14:25.405
We're still happy with the selection.

225
00:14:25.405 --> 00:14:29.054
But it seems like I'm not seeing any
different background color, okay?

226
00:14:29.054 --> 00:14:31.266
That's what I'm saying.

227
00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:33.210
But the rest looks fine.

228
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:38.570
Wanna change the route value,
look the route,

229
00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:42.601
everything seems perfectly fine.

230
00:14:42.601 --> 00:14:45.349
So, we'll go with a clean

231
00:14:46.961 --> 00:14:52.379
RStudio wants to update,
I don't wanna update.

232
00:14:55.182 --> 00:14:58.503
So, I push the codes on GitHub,
you have my latest code.

233
00:14:58.503 --> 00:15:05.646
Let's run it to see if my
NavBar is actually interactive.

234
00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:08.010
So you can see it's working.

235
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:10.277
Maybe I wanna swap the colors.

236
00:15:10.277 --> 00:15:13.455
I don't think I like how they
colors looks like right now.

237
00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:19.587
So, for that,
let's go to bottom navigation Kotlin.

238
00:15:19.587 --> 00:15:23.999
And here, when we are saying in
the NavBar item, if selected,

239
00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:26.180
I'm going to swap this color.

240
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.453
Of course, you can play with
these colors as much as you like.

241
00:15:33.622 --> 00:15:36.459
We have one primary and alternative one.

242
00:15:36.459 --> 00:15:42.612
So if I run this again,
now it looks better.

243
00:15:42.612 --> 00:15:43.414
So, the next step is to actually
change the main contents based on

244
00:15:43.414 --> 00:15:43.993
the current tab,
the current selected item.

245
00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:49.914
For that, we're going

246
00:15:49.914 --> 00:15:57.025
to do that something in app.

247
00:15:57.025 --> 00:16:01.163
Right now the content in app is
actually always offers pages.

248
00:16:01.163 --> 00:16:04.958
So, the app now has to select a route.

249
00:16:04.958 --> 00:16:09.097
So, what if we apply here when,
do you remember the when?

250
00:16:09.097 --> 00:16:10.917
The when is like the switch.

251
00:16:10.917 --> 00:16:15.776
So, I'm going to say when, the select

252
00:16:15.776 --> 00:16:21.226
the route value is, for example, offers or

253
00:16:21.226 --> 00:16:27.731
I can take it from
the routes.OffersPage.route.

254
00:16:27.731 --> 00:16:30.686
I'm going to render offers page.

255
00:16:30.686 --> 00:16:32.982
So we use arrow.

256
00:16:32.982 --> 00:16:35.683
And what do we wanna render, like this.
