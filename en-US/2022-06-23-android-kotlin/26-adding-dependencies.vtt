00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:02.260
So, what's the next step?

2
00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.205
Let's try to download real
data from the server.

3
00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:10.656
So here I have bad news.

4
00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:15.498
The bad news is, and again,
I've been an Android developer for

5
00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:18.648
ten years, and I always hated this part.

6
00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:24.392
The Android ecosystem has
no automatic encloses

7
00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:30.421
built-in simple solution
to make HTTP requests.

8
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:35.005
Everything that the OS is offering to
us is really low level, such as we

9
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:39.840
need to go to the network and download
the responses in chunks, in bytes.

10
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.196
So we need to create the buffer with
the chunks of bytes that are coming from

11
00:00:44.196 --> 00:00:46.033
the TCP stack, storing that.

12
00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:50.810
So it's a mess, and
we always needed a library.

13
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.993
There are a lot of libraries.

14
00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:57.120
There is no single library that says,
this is the jQuery of Android development.

15
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.612
No, we don't have that.

16
00:00:58.612 --> 00:00:59.684
There are so many.

17
00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:06.768
I just picked one for us to play with,
and that's an external dependency.

18
00:01:06.768 --> 00:01:11.797
So far, we didn't have the need for
an external dependency.

19
00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:14.727
So it's the first time we're
going to add a dependency.

20
00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:17.998
Where are the dependencies in our project?

21
00:01:17.998 --> 00:01:20.697
If you open the project explorer,

22
00:01:20.697 --> 00:01:25.822
there is a section here known as
Gradle Scripts, remember that?

23
00:01:25.822 --> 00:01:31.647
On Gradle Scripts, it's funny that
there are two files with the same name,

24
00:01:31.647 --> 00:01:33.570
build.gradle, okay?

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.757
Actually, remember that I mentioned
that this is not the real file system.

26
00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:38.954
This is a built on file system.

27
00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:41.275
They are not on the same folder, actually.

28
00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:45.182
So one is for the project, and
another one is for the module,

29
00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:47.564
the module is actually the real app.

30
00:01:47.564 --> 00:01:51.748
So if you open the one from the module,
so build.gradle module,

31
00:01:51.748 --> 00:01:56.388
there are many settings here,
such as the minimum SDK, the target SDK,

32
00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.766
remember we mentioned that before.

33
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:04.476
And if you scroll down,
there is a section for dependencies.

34
00:02:04.476 --> 00:02:09.837
So here,
this is like package.JSON on NPM, okay?

35
00:02:09.837 --> 00:02:13.922
Here we can add more dependencies, how?

36
00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:18.958
You need to add manually
the term implementation and

37
00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:23.428
within quote the package
that you want to use.

38
00:02:23.428 --> 00:02:27.825
For our case, for our project today,

39
00:02:27.825 --> 00:02:32.919
we will go to the section
working with data.

40
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:38.074
No, I'm sorry, we will go to Using APIs
and JSON, Adding Dependencies.

41
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:42.331
And I have here for
you something to copy and paste.

42
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:45.441
So these are the dependencies
that we're going to use.

43
00:02:45.441 --> 00:02:49.863
We're going to use actually
four libraries, Retrofit,

44
00:02:49.863 --> 00:02:53.302
OkHttp, JSON Converter, and AsyncImage.

45
00:02:53.302 --> 00:02:58.126
AsyncImage is a composable
that we can use to actually

46
00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:03.282
download images automatically
from the server, okay?

47
00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:03.926
Yeah.

48
00:03:03.926 --> 00:03:06.701
&gt;&gt; Did you say the module is the actual?

49
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.834
&gt;&gt; The module is the app.

50
00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:11.356
Yeah, because actually you
can have your project.

51
00:03:11.356 --> 00:03:14.896
And then you can have an Android app for
phones.

52
00:03:14.896 --> 00:03:18.560
Then a wearable app for Wear OS.

53
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.168
You can have an Android TV app,
all sharing the same UI elements and

54
00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:29.893
business logic and then you have
several projects, several apps.

55
00:03:29.893 --> 00:03:34.330
So we can have more than one
app in the same project, okay?

56
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.247
So I'm going to copy this part and

57
00:03:37.247 --> 00:03:42.988
paste this anywhere in
the dependencies' code block, like so.

58
00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:47.432
When you do that,
there is a warning here now saying hey,

59
00:03:47.432 --> 00:03:51.519
Gradle files have changed
since last project sync.

60
00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:57.561
So what we need to do is to sync now,
sync it now will actually,

61
00:03:57.561 --> 00:04:02.562
at the bottom you will see,
will build a project and

62
00:04:02.562 --> 00:04:06.774
we'll start downloading all the assets.

63
00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:14.004
This is like NPM install, okay,
when you're working with NPM, okay?

64
00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:18.612
After it's done, then you're
ready to use these dependencies.

65
00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:23.501
So if you can build your app, so
you go to build and you make project.

66
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:27.984
Or you just build the current project or
you run it, it means that he's working.

67
00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:31.962
If you don't get any errors, it means
that all the packages were downloaded,

68
00:04:31.962 --> 00:04:35.517
even if you're not using them,
just because you see the app running,

69
00:04:35.517 --> 00:04:38.430
it means that your packages
were downloaded correctly.
