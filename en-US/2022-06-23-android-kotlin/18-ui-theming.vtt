1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.750
The idea is that we can set these
styles directly in the theme.

2
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.852
So what we do have available
as some kind of, let's say for

3
00:00:09.852 --> 00:00:13.130
now global object within composable.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.870
It's something known as material theme.

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.971
Material theme will let you access for a
couple of things, such as color shapes and

6
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:26.000
typography, and in typography,
we have these options.

7
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.502
So, I can say that this is h5 and

8
00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:41.870
this is h4 chance to play with
this MaterialTheme.typography.

9
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.530
It's always called MaterialTheme.

10
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.550
And then you can go to
the preview file and customize.

11
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.584
What's h6 or h5 for you.

12
00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:54.669
In fact, let me swap this.

13
00:00:54.669 --> 00:01:00.199
So that's the default behavior
in terms of FontSize,

14
00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.418
FontFamily, FontWeight of h5 and h6.

15
00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:06.480
Does it make sense?

16
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.915
So the idea is that we can go and use
all the semantic styles in the theme and

17
00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:16.670
try to keep working there
instead of hard coding.

18
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.420
Text directly in each text declaration,
okay?

19
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.130
Does it make sense?

20
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.230
So, let's say that here,
I wanna add some padding.

21
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.784
So actually, as we, so
before we need to add to the function,

22
00:01:31.784 --> 00:01:35.410
call another argument, modifier.

23
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.920
And we're going to add a padding modifier.

24
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.892
Typically, we are going to use
a lot multipliers of eight,

25
00:01:43.892 --> 00:01:48.690
in material design like 8,
16 paddings, but it's up to you.

26
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.220
Do you remember how to get rid of that red
finger, they have there, I have a red.

27
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.000
Never.

28
00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.090
I need to import.

29
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.730
So Alt Enter or
option return on the Mac import.

30
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.760
So that's my modifier for the text.

31
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.399
If I want the same for the other one.

32
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.820
I need to add the modifier here,
padding, (16 dp).

33
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.479
So now we will see it's
getting better in that way.

34
00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:31.224
Maybe you're thinking,
maybe to be in terms of the font size.

35
00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:35.683
Be careful here, because
the preview has its own zoom level,

36
00:02:35.683 --> 00:02:40.560
that might not be the default
zoom level in the real form.

37
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.828
So, for
that you have the one one icon there.

38
00:02:44.828 --> 00:02:50.419
Okay, that will actually show you exactly
how it will look like in inches or

39
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:52.657
centimeters in your screen.

40
00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:57.880
Okay, so if you wanna see if it's
too big or not go to one one, okay?

41
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.860
Because that's this is not
actually the size of a real phone.

42
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.120
What if I want to see the preview
in the size of real phone?

43
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.780
Well, first we have different phones,
okay?

44
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.837
But let's say that on Android in average,

45
00:03:12.837 --> 00:03:17.920
we can say that a normal
width it's around 400 dp.

46
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.019
So if I say this now you will see
roughly how this will look like

47
00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.332
in a hairbrush of a real Android device,

48
00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:31.730
of course we have wider devices,
a narrower device.

49
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.970
So it depends on the device but at least
we have an idea of how it will look like.

50
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.110
Okay, that's it makes sense?

51
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.550
So when a while if you
want this to be center.

52
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.960
So if you want to center if you want to
align the elements, how did he sign word?

53
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.274
What actually in this case we shouldn't
work with the container, the column.

54
00:03:52.274 --> 00:03:54.520
The column is another function, right?

55
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.610
So that means that it
receives its own modifiers.

56
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.392
Okay, so I can have for example,
padding to the whole column as well.

57
00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:11.268
I'm not sure if I'm going to
keep this one but for now,

58
00:04:11.268 --> 00:04:15.832
let's say just to show you that
you can also apply buttons here.

59
00:04:15.832 --> 00:04:21.700
You typically can apply the same modifiers
to all the built in composables.

60
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.976
If you're making your own
composable it's up to you actually,

61
00:04:26.976 --> 00:04:33.243
if you allow the consumer of your
composable to modify or not the rendering.

62
00:04:33.243 --> 00:04:35.920
And column has another property.

63
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.180
It's called horizontal alignment.

64
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.780
And for the alignment,
we have a couple of options.

65
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.430
For example, I can say center or
center horizontally.

66
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.200
But if you look here, it says Rev,
it cannot find a parameter without name.

67
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.660
Its Rev, and
also I have an something here.

68
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.780
So what's going on with this?

69
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.829
So why sometimes you will find,
first I have a typo, so

70
00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:11.098
let's solve the problem like that, okay?

71
00:05:11.098 --> 00:05:16.601
But sometimes you will find that
there are some properties in red or

72
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:21.526
some arguments in red and
you don't know what's going on.

73
00:05:21.526 --> 00:05:25.301
Sometimes it's because
there is a missing import.

74
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:29.734
And at this point is finished
where that an argument in

75
00:05:29.734 --> 00:05:32.696
a function needs an import, okay?

76
00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:34.610
Does it make sense?.

77
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.707
Well, that's because that import,
it's adding another,

78
00:05:38.707 --> 00:05:43.140
let's say another version of that
function with your arguments.

79
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.568
Okay, so
you're going to see these a lot, okay?

80
00:05:47.568 --> 00:05:51.893
Anyway, we'll refresh and now it's center.

81
00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:57.685
Okay, so we're kind of getting there,
what about colors?

82
00:05:57.685 --> 00:06:02.212
Okay, well I can change
typically colors the background

83
00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:06.000
colour because it has
to do with the layout.

84
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.520
The background color is
typically a modifier.

85
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.997
So for example if I wanna change
the background color of my text It's

86
00:06:11.997 --> 00:06:13.370
a modifier.

87
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.640
They remember how to apply to
modifiers to the same composable?

88
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.217
Chaining.

89
00:06:22.217 --> 00:06:27.500
Chaining, so after the padding or
before it depends on what I want.

90
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.990
I need to add another dot.

91
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.960
Okay, and typically we do this.

92
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.260
We go to a new line, okay, like so and
then we can apply the background color.

93
00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.411
For now I'm going to
just use any color and

94
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:45.501
then we're going to work with
real colors for our project.

95
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:50.732
So, Build &amp; Refresh.

96
00:06:50.732 --> 00:06:54.595
That's how my app looks like but
now I need some separation, right,

97
00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:56.872
between the title and the description.

98
00:06:56.872 --> 00:06:59.740
Well, for
that there are two things I can do.

99
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.440
I can add another padding.

100
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.310
Can you add padding only,
like bottom padding?

101
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.240
Actually, you can apply,
there are several versions of padding.

102
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.756
One value for all two values
the first one for horizontal,

103
00:07:14.756 --> 00:07:18.480
the second one for
vertical or four values.

104
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.763
Be careful if you came from CSS,
when you're in CSS when you declare

105
00:07:23.763 --> 00:07:28.497
four values the first one is stop and
then he goes clockwise.

106
00:07:28.497 --> 00:07:32.621
Here it goes clockwise but
the first one is left that.

107
00:07:32.621 --> 00:07:35.141
Now, that here is going to start.

108
00:07:35.141 --> 00:07:37.050
So it's different anyway.

109
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.220
The other way that you have is there
is a composer will known as a spacer.

110
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.470
The spacer needs a modifier.

111
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.790
Well, first let's import the spacer.

112
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:54.155
So Alt Enter, import and
there is a modifier for

113
00:07:54.155 --> 00:07:57.919
size or for width, over height.

114
00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:03.507
So we have one full size where
we can express width and

115
00:08:03.507 --> 00:08:06.435
height or just the height.

116
00:08:06.435 --> 00:08:12.505
So I in DPS, so
I can actually say I want 16 dp.

117
00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:16.855
So this is actually, so what's the
difference between using a margin here?

118
00:08:16.855 --> 00:08:19.245
I'm not touching.

119
00:08:19.245 --> 00:08:22.292
I'm not modifying the text
composables just for

120
00:08:22.292 --> 00:08:25.495
that margin that I want in between.

121
00:08:25.495 --> 00:08:31.820
There is some special composer for
that known as a spacer.

122
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.100
Okay, that's it make sense?

123
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.610
It's up to you.

124
00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.310
Which option do you wanna use, okay?

125
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.954
If I want for example, the title
to be bold and so I'm one I like,

126
00:08:43.954 --> 00:08:46.490
override the style.

127
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.540
It's font weight.

128
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.687
Some times the ad gets a little weird.

129
00:08:54.687 --> 00:09:00.240
It's FontWeight.Bold for
example, something like that.

130
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.578
So now my title shall be bold.

131
00:09:01.578 --> 00:09:04.740
Okay, it works.

132
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.274
Okay, so at this point,

133
00:09:06.274 --> 00:09:10.670
I think that you get the idea on how
to start designing quickly your app.

134
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.949
So let's start adding some new
stuff first, regarding colors.

135
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:18.000
So we are going to create a real app.

136
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.680
So I already have some color for you.

137
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:27.680
So we didn't here in
the companion website.

138
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.660
There is a section setting
up theme colors, okay?

139
00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.680
Where I have some color to copy and paste.

140
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.760
So I'm going to do this, again,
I'm in the companion website.

141
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.138
So and these are colors that I have
already defined where to put these colors.

142
00:09:44.138 --> 00:09:48.130
Sorry, under Studio.

143
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.250
You go to Color Kotlin file in your theme.

144
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.370
And we add these colors.

145
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.148
You have a nice color preview there.

146
00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:04.040
And if you click there, you can also
change the color with the color picker.

147
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:10.820
If you pay attention to
the color of declaration,

148
00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.604
it's RGB with asteroids.

149
00:10:13.604 --> 00:10:17.206
So this is actually instead of,
if you have a color like this

150
00:10:17.206 --> 00:10:22.660
one, In the color that you're used to.

151
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:29.200
Here it's, first,
instead of the pound, we use 0x.

152
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:34.340
0x and the number because it's actually
a long, it's an a long integer, okay?

153
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.710
And also, we need to be very
careful here because this is ARGV.

154
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:43.250
Is not RGV, a for alpha.

155
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:49.688
And because it is an integer,
if you don't provide the alpha,

156
00:10:49.688 --> 00:10:53.480
so the upper number,
actually alpha will be 0.

157
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.670
Alpha 0, it fully transparent,
so you won't see the color.

158
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.468
That's why, if you don't want that,
you start with FF.

159
00:11:03.468 --> 00:11:08.143
So you take the normal color that you're
used to and you prefix that with 0x FF.

160
00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:10.210
Does that make sense?

161
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:10.711
And then RGV.

162
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:15.396
Yeah, so be careful with that.

163
00:11:17.845 --> 00:11:24.540
So the searchers color Global
variables that we are creating.

164
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.514
But if we want we can also go to
the theme declaration and select for

165
00:11:29.514 --> 00:11:34.590
the dark theme and the light thing,
which colors do we want to use?

166
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:42.894
So then, several composer levels will take
the color from the theme automatically.

167
00:11:42.894 --> 00:11:48.412
In our compose ours we can use the color
names that I have just selected.

168
00:11:48.412 --> 00:11:53.420
But if I want the buttons and
many other composables to

169
00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.995
use these colors automatically,
I can just use them here.

170
00:11:58.995 --> 00:12:05.230
So for example, I can say that my
primary color is not purple 500.

171
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.260
It's the primary color
that I selected here.

172
00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.720
I can change the name,
it can be any name, okay?

173
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.740
So then I go to the theme,
I say this is the color I want.

174
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:19.313
For a variant, I want the secondary color.

175
00:12:19.313 --> 00:12:22.472
Well, actually, there is a secondary here.

176
00:12:22.472 --> 00:12:26.695
We'll choose the secondary here,
of course you can change this and

177
00:12:26.695 --> 00:12:29.720
we have an alternative version.

178
00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.795
These are just variables
that I have created.

179
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.520
Makes sense?

180
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.843
This is like doing CSS variables
if you want with your colors.

181
00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:46.120
So we can set colors at the app
level in the color Kotlin file.

182
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.312
And then we can go to the theme and
set your theme.

183
00:12:49.312 --> 00:12:52.847
Hey theme, I want your primary
color to be that color.

184
00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:59.030
When you are using these colors,
you have two options later.

185
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.270
You can take the color from the theme or

186
00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:04.400
take the color directly
as a global variable.

187
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:09.076
What's the advantage of using
the theme that we have two sets for

188
00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:10.640
dark and light mode?

189
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.210
So then based on that,
it will take the right color and

190
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:20.170
if you are using the global color, it's
just that color and always that color,

191
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:23.410
doesn't make sense, I'm saying?

192
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:28.937
So if you wanna support dark theme,
then you have to use the theme colors and

193
00:13:28.937 --> 00:13:33.438
not directly the colors that
you create a global variables.

194
00:13:33.438 --> 00:13:40.140
So meaning that going back to my offer,
instead of using this color that we have.

195
00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:47.684
We can use any of my the colors that I
have like Alternative1, Alternative2.

196
00:13:47.684 --> 00:13:52.636
So, background Alternative1, Alternative2,

197
00:13:52.636 --> 00:13:56.693
and I will take that color,
its way for it.

198
00:14:02.872 --> 00:14:04.655
See render problem.

199
00:14:04.655 --> 00:14:09.320
So sometimes we can go to the build
menu and select clean project.

200
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:12.150
Sometimes it's necessary.

201
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.191
They come back here.

202
00:14:20.641 --> 00:14:25.054
By the way, let's use the same
color on both alternative 1.

203
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.000
And now it's taking my color.

204
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.030
So what happened?

205
00:14:30.030 --> 00:14:34.832
No one knows, that it's actually something
in the cache of Android Studio because

206
00:14:34.832 --> 00:14:39.508
there are so many components here working,
that sometimes the cache messed up.

207
00:14:39.508 --> 00:14:43.220
And you need to go to Bill and
clean the pressure.

208
00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.530
It's necessary.

209
00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:48.710
So you need to turn off and
turn on again, yeah.

210
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.240
Max, how did the alternative 1,
how did that get to the theme?

211
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.180
Actually, right now,
I'm not using the theme.

212
00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:00.530
So, if you look at my code right now, I'm
actually accessing alternative 1 directly.

213
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:03.947
If you wanna use the theme,
you need to use material theme and

214
00:15:03.947 --> 00:15:05.730
then access the colors.

215
00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.000
And here you have all the colors
define in the material theme.

216
00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:13.810
But how did that alternative
1 get associated?

217
00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.250
You need to go, if you wanna associate
one of those you go to the theme.

218
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.140
Or you make a manual.

219
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.102
A manual you say okay,
for the dark color and

220
00:15:21.102 --> 00:15:24.960
here you have some options like,
where are the options?

221
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.589
Well, if you look at these dark colors,
the light colors, declaration,

222
00:15:29.589 --> 00:15:33.930
you see they're all
the possibilities that you have.

223
00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.240
For the surface, for the primary.

224
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:41.500
These are just variable names that
someone said on the material design.

225
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.166
But so you can use
the the color from the theme or

226
00:15:45.166 --> 00:15:49.020
you can use your own colors directly.

227
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.258
It's just funny that it
says private [LAUGH].

228
00:15:53.258 --> 00:15:56.630
Yeah, this variable is private.

229
00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:02.069
Okay, the variable, DarkColorPalette
because they want you to get this

230
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:07.873
color from the theme and the theme will
pick dark or light based on the context.

231
00:16:07.873 --> 00:16:11.796
They don't want you to take
the color from there directly,

232
00:16:11.796 --> 00:16:16.437
they want you to ask the theme for
the color that's why it's private.

233
00:16:16.437 --> 00:16:18.265
Okay, that's make sense?

234
00:16:18.265 --> 00:16:19.520
Cool, well.

235
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.095
You don't have to defy,
you can have like a system,

236
00:16:23.095 --> 00:16:28.290
you usually want to find your own maybe
right but, there's a system like.

237
00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.460
If you wanna use the system colors?

238
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.000
Yeah, it's fine.

239
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.770
So I think I have
a missing something here.

240
00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.880
Yeah, because I have
a dot here doing nothing.

241
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:39.080
So let me go back to alternative 1.

242
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.970
I think alternative 2 is
a little brighter, lighter.

243
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.097
So it will work better with black,
like so.
