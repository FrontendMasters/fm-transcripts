1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.470
So we are going to be building this app.

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.120
It's called Coffee Masters.

3
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.126
So let's say that, we have a coffee shop,
so we are selling coffee, okay?

4
00:00:09.126 --> 00:00:12.866
We are the new Starbucks competitor,
and we need to make the app so

5
00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:15.200
you can make orders, from the app.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.590
That's kind of the idea.

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.760
So that's our portion.

8
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.837
We're going to be building
this app from scratch, okay?

9
00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:24.564
So I have for you some assets so
you can download the assets we'll

10
00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:28.912
see how to do that later, in terms of
the icon we're not going to be building

11
00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:33.562
the icon from scratch but the app, the
swift code will be written from scratch.

12
00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:35.730
So it's an app from a coffee store.

13
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.709
We're going through SwiftUI and
as I mentioned before,

14
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:42.480
we're going to be using the Apple
human interface guidelines.

15
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.190
Which means,
it will look like an iOS application.

16
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.850
So, because when you're building
a mobile app these days,

17
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.657
you can actually pick a side.

18
00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:56.536
You can make an Android application that
looks like an Android application and

19
00:00:56.536 --> 00:01:00.414
iOS looks like an iOS application or you
can make your own custom user interface

20
00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:03.495
and then your app looks the same
on both platforms or similar.

21
00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:08.581
Now if you take Instagram or Tik Tok they
have their own custom user interface so

22
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:13.130
they are not actually following
completely all the guidelines on each

23
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.387
platform it's just Tik Tok okay?

24
00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.470
So in this case we are going
to make it an iOS application.

25
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.791
So trying to use what the platform is
offering to us, as I mentioned before,

26
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:28.670
okay, so you can download the assets
from the companion website.

27
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.630
And also you have some coding helps.

28
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.830
While I'm writing code,
I'm going to write this code from scratch.

29
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.437
But if you want to just copy and
paste or see what I'm doing,

30
00:01:38.437 --> 00:01:43.002
also you have, let's say 90% similar
code on that companion website.

31
00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:46.533
I'm going to get out of
the presentation for a minute and

32
00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.100
I will show you that companion website.

33
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.070
This is the URL remember, firtman that's
my last name .github.io/intro-swift.

34
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.460
And here you have again introduction.

35
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.713
In the introduction you have
here the link to actually

36
00:02:04.713 --> 00:02:08.610
download the workshop's assets,
there okay?

37
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.459
Is the font size a little bit so workshops
assets, so that's a zipped folder with PNG

38
00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.894
files on, another file that we
will see in a minute, okay?

39
00:02:16.894 --> 00:02:19.420
We're going to use that later.

40
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.440
So, then here you have all the steps
that we're going to be doing.

41
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.170
We will see this later.

42
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.652
But I wanna show you here a little video
of the app that we are going to be

43
00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:37.160
building in fact, instead of showing you
the video, I will open the IOS simulator.

44
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.540
We will see how that works in a minute.

45
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.330
So for now,
just believe me that this works.

46
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.960
This is the app.

47
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.310
So the app will look like this.

48
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.310
This is the app the actual app running.

49
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.360
Okay, this is the app that
we are going to be building.

50
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.290
So you can add to cappuccinos
to the car to the order.

51
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.178
Okay, and here you can see the order and
you can submit the order that kind of

52
00:03:02.178 --> 00:03:06.260
video we have a section with offers
here we have tabs at the bottom.

53
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.642
So I'm talking about here at the bottom,
so these are known as tabs, so

54
00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:13.650
it's a tab navigation that's the idea,
okay?

55
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.930
That's the goal we're going
to be building this app
