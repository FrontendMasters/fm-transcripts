1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.054
We were saying that we need a way
to access this from the view,

2
00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:08.684
from the user interface.

3
00:00:08.684 --> 00:00:11.786
And we need a single source of truth with

4
00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:15.645
I don't wanna pass this
array with properties.

5
00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:20.894
So we have a better way,
something known as embodiment option.

6
00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:25.934
So embodiment option is
a way that we have to inject

7
00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:32.777
in the view hierarchy objects that
anyone in the hierarchy can use.

8
00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:36.147
And they work like Singleton's so
actually.

9
00:00:36.147 --> 00:00:41.114
If these managers are actually good
candidates for that, make sense?

10
00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:47.730
So we inject in the anywhere in
the hierarchy these managers.

11
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.219
So anyone can access the menu manager or
the cart manager.

12
00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.725
That's kinda idea.

13
00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:57.228
Does it make sense?

14
00:00:57.228 --> 00:00:58.565
So how to do that?

15
00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:02.791
First we need to pick where in the
hierarchy we went in check this, anywhere.

16
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:06.685
But if it's something global,
most of the time,

17
00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:10.961
we can go as app as possible
directly to the app itself.

18
00:01:13.136 --> 00:01:17.984
Okay, to the app itself we
can inject directly here

19
00:01:17.984 --> 00:01:22.401
to the content view for
example we can inject.

20
00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:30.422
This embodiment option and how to do that

21
00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:35.920
through basically,
our old friend modifier.

22
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.955
Embodiment option and
it says that the object

23
00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:47.324
that we can inject has to
comply with observable option.

24
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:51.766
So that's a protocol, okay?

25
00:01:51.766 --> 00:01:55.565
So if we wanna inject an object so
what's the idea here?

26
00:01:55.565 --> 00:02:01.111
The idea is that I can create here
a variable for my Menu Manager.

27
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:07.099
I can create an instance of it and
another one for my cart manager.

28
00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.716
It's kinda empty at this point like so.

29
00:02:11.716 --> 00:02:15.780
So if I wanna check those
by weights one by one.

30
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.564
So I can add Menu Manager and

31
00:02:18.564 --> 00:02:23.903
I can add cart manager has
two different modifiers.

32
00:02:23.903 --> 00:02:30.123
But they must implement they
must conform to the protocol.

33
00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:36.156
Observable option it's not gonna
work okay does it make sense.

34
00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:43.055
So actually when we wanna inject this
Singleton's these global objects,

35
00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:47.006
those objects must implement a protocol.

36
00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:51.526
So now if I'm gonna Menu Manager
how to implement the protocol,

37
00:02:51.526 --> 00:02:54.466
just column and the name of the protocol.

38
00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.096
So observable options.

39
00:02:57.096 --> 00:03:03.853
So this protocol in particular is
not forcing me to do anything.

40
00:03:03.853 --> 00:03:07.733
Just with that slide it's good okay.

41
00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:12.930
So I'm adding Colin observable option on

42
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.131
Menu Manager and cart manager like that.

43
00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:23.510
And what we need to do is
the variable that we wanna

44
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.951
use to subscribe bindings to
something new at published.

45
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:34.884
So if we want views to
have some bindings to that

46
00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:40.197
variable then we need to
add published is actually

47
00:03:40.197 --> 00:03:45.395
a simple way for
know when that menu is changing.

48
00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:49.560
It's another annotation similar to state.

49
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.827
So we need an observable
object with typically one or

50
00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:55.135
more variables that are published.

51
00:03:57.432 --> 00:04:00.840
Okay, now we'll see how to use this.

52
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.650
Any question?

53
00:04:03.887 --> 00:04:07.776
It's getting more abstract
at this point I know but

54
00:04:07.776 --> 00:04:10.765
at the end we will connect all the dots.

55
00:04:10.765 --> 00:04:15.648
Of course we don't want this
we wanna go to the network and

56
00:04:15.648 --> 00:04:18.405
download this product, okay.

57
00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:22.104
For that, I already have an API.

58
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:23.435
It's available.

59
00:04:23.435 --> 00:04:27.510
So if you go back here
to working with data,

60
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.414
we have already used data manager
using environment object.

61
00:04:33.414 --> 00:04:36.927
While we didn't create the car
we can actually do that,

62
00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:38.584
we can do that in a minute.

63
00:04:38.584 --> 00:04:44.144
But before doing that,
I'm gonna show you the JSON file.

64
00:04:44.144 --> 00:04:47.219
This is the JSON.

65
00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:54.315
That as you can see, has an array
of categories with products inside.

66
00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:59.597
That is matching my
structure my data model.

67
00:04:59.597 --> 00:05:05.262
Okay, so what I want now is I wanna
download that JSON parse the JSON.

68
00:05:05.262 --> 00:05:08.569
I know it sounds scary, but you will see,
it's actually pretty simple and

69
00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:09.474
straightforward.

70
00:05:09.474 --> 00:05:13.625
And we wanna feel that
array that collection and

71
00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:16.440
then render that on the screen.
