WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.482
So let's do the step that we
are missing here, that is the cart.

2
00:00:05.482 --> 00:00:09.117
So the cart page right
now it's kind of empty,

3
00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:12.300
it's just a text saying, Hello World.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.391
So let's design that cart page.

5
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:19.295
That, again, it's just a design so

6
00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:23.803
it's actually similar to what
we've been doing so far.

7
00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:28.352
Before doing that,
my CartManager is empty.

8
00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:29.540
So, what is the cart?

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.244
The cart it's actually an array
of products, okay, but

10
00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:39.341
with one special addition,
we have quantity as well, okay?

11
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:42.930
So we have one cappuccino, two muffins.

12
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.547
So we can use a tuple for
that product quantity,

13
00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.250
product integer, that makes sense?

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.820
So I can create a published property,
published variable,

15
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.900
because we are going to
actually see this in action.

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.222
It can be the cart that the type is
a tuple of products in the chart.

17
00:01:05.222 --> 00:01:09.891
And we start with an empty array,
that's how you set

18
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:15.218
an empty array like in JavaScript,
like in JSON, okay?

19
00:01:15.218 --> 00:01:17.745
By the way, it's an array of this,
sorry, my fault.

20
00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:19.394
So it's an array of tuples.

21
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.220
That's the type, my bad,
so an array of tuple.

22
00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:27.592
Okay, does it make sense?

23
00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:31.016
&gt;&gt; Yeah, is there a way to set it for
example,

24
00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:33.787
the second one to zero right away?

25
00:01:33.787 --> 00:01:38.361
&gt;&gt; No, you're going to do that when
you add the value to the array,

26
00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:39.643
not here, okay?

27
00:01:39.643 --> 00:01:42.415
When you add the value to
the array you can do that.

28
00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:44.929
Okay, so what about the cart page?

29
00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:50.305
I'm going now to cart page that
is called OrdersPage actually.

30
00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:53.916
So I'm going to OrdersPage,
I need to replace that text, Hello World,

31
00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:55.704
with something more interesting.

32
00:01:55.704 --> 00:02:02.106
So, if we go back to the course,
where is so,

33
00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:06.658
I'm now in five, four, okay?

34
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.916
We need to update DetailsPage,

35
00:02:09.916 --> 00:02:14.500
because now we have a product actually but
we can do that in a minute.

36
00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.126
And here we have the OrderPage, okay?

37
00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:25.511
So this is the final version of
the OrderPage, I will just paste The body.

38
00:02:26.943 --> 00:02:29.483
Okay, and it's a long body and

39
00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:34.084
I will show you how to refactor
this a little bit, okay?

40
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.391
When you have bodies like this that
are really long, maybe it's a good

41
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:45.408
idea to start refactoring and
creating the smaller views.

42
00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:47.665
They don't need to be on a different file,

43
00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:50.750
you're gonna have several
views in the same file, okay?

44
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.390
That's not actually a problem, but having
things like this is too large, okay?

45
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.680
So it's a good idea to work
with several sub-structures.

46
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.818
So, I know it sounds scary because
we have a lot of stuff here, but

47
00:03:08.818 --> 00:03:12.220
actually we will see in
a minute that it's not so big.

48
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.002
First, before actually
trying to understand

49
00:03:17.002 --> 00:03:22.402
what's inside,
we need the CartManager, right?

50
00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.420
So we need the CartManager.

51
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.970
The CartManager is the file
that we have just created.

52
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:35.507
We injected that through the hierarchy,
but how can we receive that here?

53
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:38.536
So I need a CartManager, okay?

54
00:03:38.536 --> 00:03:42.763
And we know it's of type, CartManager.

55
00:03:42.763 --> 00:03:47.547
It's the one that contains the array,
okay, we have just created that,

56
00:03:47.547 --> 00:03:49.100
it contains the array.

57
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.248
So how can we ask the injector,
or whoever is working

58
00:03:54.248 --> 00:03:58.814
with injecting these
views that we want this?

59
00:03:58.814 --> 00:04:03.645
We actually need to use another decorator,
okay?

60
00:04:03.645 --> 00:04:07.521
So it's another decorator,
in fact, it was already here,

61
00:04:07.521 --> 00:04:11.788
I didn't paste it on purpose,
it's called EnvironmentObject.

62
00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:15.981
We don't need to create the object,

63
00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:21.119
just with saying this,
this is going to bring

64
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:26.135
the singleton that was
injected in the App.

65
00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:31.039
I don't need to do anything else,
I'll just say,

66
00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.145
in this variable I will
capture one of these

67
00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:39.838
observable objects that
we injected in the app.

68
00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:47.101
Just as a reminder I'm talking about this,
when we were adding an EnvironmentObject.

69
00:04:49.334 --> 00:04:54.080
So from the other side, we are actually
capturing this CartManager option.

70
00:04:55.565 --> 00:05:01.501
We are injecting it in the whole app,
so any view in the hierarchy,

71
00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:07.439
any view no matter how deep is set,
it can actually now receive it.

72
00:05:09.165 --> 00:05:17.415
Okay, that's actually how you
receive these global objects.

73
00:05:17.415 --> 00:05:19.376
Okay, does it make sense?

74
00:05:19.376 --> 00:05:21.040
So now if we read the code,

75
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.213
it's on navigation view that's the one
that sets the title and let us navigate.

76
00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:33.250
I'm asking if the count is 0, if it's
0 I'm rendering a text, can I use if?

77
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:40.209
Yes I can, I can use if,
I can use conditionals within views body.

78
00:05:40.209 --> 00:05:45.999
So I'm just saying, your order is empty,
if not, I'm rendering a list.

79
00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:49.856
The list can contain sections, okay?

80
00:05:49.856 --> 00:05:51.056
What is a section?

81
00:05:51.056 --> 00:05:55.890
Let me show you this directly
in iOS settings app.

82
00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.847
This is a list, so,
here we can see different sections.

83
00:06:00.847 --> 00:06:07.388
So this is a section, this is another
section, another section, just that.

84
00:06:07.388 --> 00:06:11.567
And it's another view with a title and
its content.

85
00:06:15.484 --> 00:06:19.894
Okay, so I have the items, the details,

86
00:06:19.894 --> 00:06:23.551
I will see what is this in a minute.

87
00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:28.887
I have another section with a total,
with an edge tag,

88
00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:32.605
and a button, and some other things.

89
00:06:32.605 --> 00:06:35.879
Let me remove this for a minute.

90
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.740
Or we can actually put it like so.

91
00:06:43.413 --> 00:06:47.025
Expect the expression, yeah,
because this ends here.

92
00:06:49.346 --> 00:06:53.322
Okay, let's see if we can preview this,
I have

93
00:06:54.995 --> 00:06:58.742
A balance issue, and
why do I have a balance issue?

94
00:06:58.742 --> 00:07:01.944
Because this code is too large.

95
00:07:01.944 --> 00:07:05.650
Remember I mentioned typically
we wanna separate this.

96
00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.573
Can we separate this easily?

97
00:07:07.573 --> 00:07:11.274
Well actually when you come and
click here,

98
00:07:11.274 --> 00:07:16.190
sometimes it depends on the case,
you can extract a view.

99
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.119
But if this view it's actually
needing more items, well,

100
00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:23.891
it will not give you the option
you need to do it manually,

101
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:28.710
to integrate another structure for
a resection or something like that.

102
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:33.601
So this is complaining because
it's expecting an OrderItem,

103
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:35.363
what is an OrderItem?

104
00:07:35.363 --> 00:07:41.785
In the cart, we have these UI,

105
00:07:41.785 --> 00:07:47.393
this view, this is the OrderItem,
including the trash icon.

106
00:07:47.393 --> 00:07:50.092
Okay, so it's asking, hey, you need that.

107
00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:52.490
What is the OrderItem?

108
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.032
Something I need to create.

109
00:07:54.032 --> 00:07:58.650
Another view, we have ProductItem,
we need OrderItem.

110
00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:59.962
Does it make sense?

111
00:07:59.962 --> 00:08:02.505
So in your file, OrderItem.

112
00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:09.302
But it's not a view,
it's part of a view, yeah.

113
00:08:09.302 --> 00:08:14.751
But, I mean, I didn't use the template
view so, can I use it anyway?

114
00:08:14.751 --> 00:08:18.986
Yeah, but I will not have a preview
unless I create a preview manually,

115
00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:20.622
that's the only problem.

116
00:08:20.622 --> 00:08:25.010
Okay, so it's not a big deal,
but you can still work with this.

117
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:27.444
So, I can delete this and
create a new one.

118
00:08:29.383 --> 00:08:35.225
So, new file, swiftUI view,

119
00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:40.854
and now OrderItem, like so.

120
00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:44.340
Let's keep it Hello World, that's okay.

121
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:52.447
So now we do have
an ordered item Like that,

122
00:08:52.447 --> 00:08:59.430
so let's see what it's
complaining here about.

123
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.950
So we have here a name and a phone number.

124
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.253
So there is a form, because you're sending
a form, from there we have TextFields.

125
00:09:11.253 --> 00:09:16.768
Remember with TextFields, we have to set

126
00:09:16.768 --> 00:09:21.626
Some variables, remember how @State,

127
00:09:21.626 --> 00:09:25.518
yeah, so @State, we have a name

128
00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:31.812
And we have an email, okay, like so.

129
00:09:31.812 --> 00:09:37.530
So remember we actually need that,
always we need that.

130
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:44.421
So we're removing some elements from here.

131
00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:46.150
So we have another problem here, List.

132
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:50.353
When we are looping through elements for
each, so

133
00:09:50.353 --> 00:09:56.272
far if you remember, we were doing for
each with something like this.

134
00:09:56.272 --> 00:09:59.320
Remember, we were doing it forEach
with a fixed number, okay?

135
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.558
Does it make sense?

136
00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:05.688
Instead of doing that,
we can do forEach with a collection.

137
00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:06.809
Makes sense?

138
00:10:06.809 --> 00:10:11.749
The only mandatory problem is
the collection needs a way to identify

139
00:10:11.749 --> 00:10:15.293
each item individually So

140
00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:20.109
we must identify each element somehow.

141
00:10:20.109 --> 00:10:25.154
There are two ways to do that,
we can define here

142
00:10:25.154 --> 00:10:29.704
where is the ID, and
for that we use a path.

143
00:10:29.704 --> 00:10:31.554
You say .0, what's that .0?

144
00:10:31.554 --> 00:10:33.699
Do you remember what's this?

145
00:10:33.699 --> 00:10:36.827
&gt;&gt; Is it the tuple?

146
00:10:36.827 --> 00:10:38.083
&gt;&gt; Sorry, what?
&gt;&gt; Is it the tuple?

147
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:39.186
&gt;&gt; The tuple.

148
00:10:39.186 --> 00:10:39.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

149
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.715
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; In the CartManager, we created a tuple.

150
00:10:43.715 --> 00:10:48.410
So the tuple was .0, and
because it's a product it has its own ID.

151
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.917
Does it make sense?

152
00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:57.920
I'm using that as an example, by the way,
I'm calling this cart not product.

153
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.700
&gt;&gt; But the cart manager
could have account itself-

154
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.573
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

155
00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:02.618
&gt;&gt; It's not email form, sorry.

156
00:11:02.618 --> 00:11:05.680
It's phone, not email, we can change
that for email, I'm sorry, yeah?

157
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.125
&gt;&gt; No, no, the CartManager,

158
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:10.395
you could have count within
CartManager too probably, right?

159
00:11:10.395 --> 00:11:11.300
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's just the same.

160
00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:18.654
Well, look at that, it's asking
me if I wanna send a bug report.

161
00:11:18.654 --> 00:11:23.406
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So let's close the app and try again,

162
00:11:23.406 --> 00:11:28.039
just to make this better,
okay, interesting.

163
00:11:30.312 --> 00:11:36.471
I have this Bill fail,

164
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:41.530
let's see cartManager.total.

165
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.249
By the way, I can just comment
as in any other language,

166
00:11:45.249 --> 00:11:50.395
this is just swift that we are writing,
so you can use Command forward slash,

167
00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:54.060
to comment and uncomment and
that's perfectly fine.

168
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.401
I wanna see if I can get rid of that,
okay, we are kind of there.

169
00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:02.005
So now it's complaining in the provider.

170
00:12:02.005 --> 00:12:04.611
So it's missing argument, why?

171
00:12:04.611 --> 00:12:08.573
Because it's saying that it
should have a name and a phone,

172
00:12:08.573 --> 00:12:13.662
that's because I didn't set a default
value, and they're not optional.

173
00:12:13.662 --> 00:12:18.548
So, if you wanna create an orders page,
you have to set

174
00:12:18.548 --> 00:12:23.661
a value unless you have
a default value like this, okay?

175
00:12:23.661 --> 00:12:29.973
And I think that finally we have
something to render, something to see.

176
00:12:29.973 --> 00:12:35.192
So when that happens, you see,
okay, we have a big crash.

177
00:12:35.192 --> 00:12:40.145
And it's important to understand what
this crash is actually telling us.

178
00:12:40.145 --> 00:12:43.814
It says coffee masters quit unexpectedly.

179
00:12:43.814 --> 00:12:46.252
It says, what's going on here?

180
00:12:46.252 --> 00:12:49.427
There is some problem
somewhere in our code, and

181
00:12:49.427 --> 00:12:54.306
remember that the preview is actually
executing the app in the simulator,

182
00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:57.260
so it's executing the app
in the simulator.

183
00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.842
So the simulator is not a real iPhone,
it's running on my Mac.

184
00:13:01.842 --> 00:13:04.520
So the app actually crashed on my Mac.

185
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:09.290
To actually see what's going on, you need
to click on diagnostics in the preview.

186
00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.525
That will give you the error message or
what's going on,

187
00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:16.977
sometimes it's useful sometimes it's not.

188
00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:23.461
Here it says, let's zoom in, and
it's a pretty easy to understand problem.

189
00:13:23.461 --> 00:13:28.111
It says no ObservableObject
of type CartManager found.

190
00:13:29.779 --> 00:13:35.048
So, it's saying that it didn't
find any environmentObject

191
00:13:35.048 --> 00:13:39.200
in the preview,
this has to do with the preview,

192
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.979
look at this,
preview is missing environment object.

193
00:13:43.979 --> 00:13:46.050
So what's going on?

194
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:50.676
We are injecting, we are bringing
an object from the hierarchy, but

195
00:13:50.676 --> 00:13:52.362
what about the preview?

196
00:13:52.362 --> 00:13:53.863
&gt;&gt; You're not injecting it there.

197
00:13:53.863 --> 00:13:58.404
&gt;&gt; The preview is just the OrdersPage,
it doesn't contain the app,

198
00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.794
does it make sense?

199
00:13:59.794 --> 00:14:04.266
So it doesn't contain that object.

200
00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:08.499
So we have a problem, the problem is that,
it cannot render the preview,

201
00:14:08.499 --> 00:14:12.122
because it doesn't contain
the dependency in the hierarchy,

202
00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:15.360
because we are just rendering
one small part of our app.

203
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.235
So to solve the problem, we need to
come to the PreviewProvider, and

204
00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:27.334
also add, while it's complaining,
so ignore again, ignore again.

205
00:14:27.334 --> 00:14:32.542
And we need to inject the environment
object in the preview,

206
00:14:32.542 --> 00:14:38.480
so which one, a new CartManager,
so an empty one, problem solved.

207
00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:43.078
Again, this is important,
every time you are previewing,

208
00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:46.955
you have a preview on a view
that has a dependency and

209
00:14:46.955 --> 00:14:53.740
that dependency is an environment object,
the preview needs that environment object.

210
00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:57.290
So you need to inject one, because it's
not actually within the hierarchy.

211
00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:02.173
Okay, now it's telling that
the order is empty, why?

212
00:15:02.173 --> 00:15:05.974
Well, because that CartManager is empty,

213
00:15:05.974 --> 00:15:11.532
is one that they have just created
without any elements inside.

214
00:15:11.532 --> 00:15:12.891
Okay, does it makes sense?

215
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:15.751
So we have that situation that-
&gt;&gt; I think we should

216
00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:19.939
put the environment object right away,
but maybe not in this page, right?

217
00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:20.645
&gt;&gt; Add the product?

218
00:15:20.645 --> 00:15:21.418
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

219
00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:28.285
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well,
probably we will use it later,

220
00:15:28.285 --> 00:15:32.820
yeah, somehow for the item.

221
00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:35.566
But because the item says,
Hello World, right now,

222
00:15:35.566 --> 00:15:37.528
that's why nothing happens, okay?

223
00:15:37.528 --> 00:15:39.124
So any questions at this point?

224
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.958
&gt;&gt; So, I mean, if you were really
stubborn, if you don't want a preview,

225
00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:46.088
you could ignore, I mean,

226
00:15:46.088 --> 00:15:48.817
you will have to just compile it
each time which would be come out.

227
00:15:48.817 --> 00:15:51.347
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, you can remove
the preview and just run the app.

228
00:15:51.347 --> 00:15:53.276
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; But you're losing the preview

229
00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:55.264
&gt;&gt; I know you have to kind of you have it.

230
00:15:55.264 --> 00:15:58.192
&gt;&gt; You're losing the preview ability,
that's the problem.

231
00:15:58.192 --> 00:15:59.213
&gt;&gt; You wanted it.

232
00:15:59.213 --> 00:16:00.234
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the problem.
