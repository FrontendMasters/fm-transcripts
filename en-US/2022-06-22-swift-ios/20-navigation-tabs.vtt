00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.739
Okay, so as I was mentioning here,
it doesn't look like an app yet.

2
00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.743
So, things like tabs,
I'm pretty sure you think like,

3
00:00:07.743 --> 00:00:11.829
that looks like a lot of work,
creating the tabs at the bottom.

4
00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:17.274
You're going to see it's really simple,
really simple, believe me.

5
00:00:17.274 --> 00:00:18.609
So look at this.

6
00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.877
I'm going to ContentView,

7
00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:26.836
ContentView is my initial element that
right now has just the OffersPage.

8
00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:28.607
It's rendering the OffersPage.

9
00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:34.802
Instead of doing that, I'm going to
render a TabView, okay, TabView.

10
00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:42.678
And now, OffersPage will become one of the
options in the TabView, okay, just that.

11
00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:46.638
So also apart from OffersPage,

12
00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:51.771
we have more options, I'm going to, for

13
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:56.769
now, create a text that says Home Page.

14
00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.472
Then we have OffersPage, and
we say we have the Order Page,

15
00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:08.313
and we have the Info Page, okay, like so.

16
00:01:08.313 --> 00:01:12.893
So if I do this interactivity, so

17
00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:17.973
I see the Home Page and nothing else.

18
00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.592
What's the Home Page?

19
00:01:20.592 --> 00:01:21.943
A text, It's a text saying Home Page.

20
00:01:21.943 --> 00:01:23.177
That's all.

21
00:01:23.177 --> 00:01:28.117
So something that I can
add to each of these

22
00:01:28.117 --> 00:01:33.211
elements is, I can add quickly a tabItem.

23
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:35.498
What is a tabItem?

24
00:01:35.498 --> 00:01:39.959
The icon and the text that we want for

25
00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.285
that particular element, okay?

26
00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:52.396
If you go to the website, we're actually
working here in 4.1 using TabViews, okay?

27
00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:54.950
So we want a tabItem.

28
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.719
So there are many ways to use a tabItem,
one of those is this one.

29
00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.452
So if you create an image and a text,

30
00:02:05.452 --> 00:02:12.343
this is called Home Page, okay, like so.

31
00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:13.128
That's fine.

32
00:02:13.128 --> 00:02:18.244
And then I need an image, or do we need
an icon, so we need the PNG or the SVG?

33
00:02:18.244 --> 00:02:22.513
Well, Apple includes
a collection of several

34
00:02:22.513 --> 00:02:26.680
thousands open source and
free icons to use.

35
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.300
So instead of how to use those,

36
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.160
we create an image with a system name and
our info.

37
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.034
Look at the bottom, can you see that?

38
00:02:38.034 --> 00:02:43.245
Can you spot that thing that
appear there that says Info?

39
00:02:44.993 --> 00:02:52.609
So where can I find all
the icons that I can use?

40
00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.224
Here at the bottom,
you have a link in the Companion website

41
00:02:58.224 --> 00:03:03.969
that goes to the Apple website,
to an app called SF Symbols.

42
00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.840
SF Symbols, It's SF from San Francisco,

43
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.088
because that's the name of the font
that Apple is using in IOS.

44
00:03:11.088 --> 00:03:15.977
So this is the name of an app that
you can install on your Mac, so

45
00:03:15.977 --> 00:03:20.691
you can download that app from here,
where you can browse.

46
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:22.415
It's not in the App Store, the app,

47
00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:24.929
it's just an installer that
you download from here.

48
00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:32.445
You can browse all the icons,
By topic or you can search, okay?

49
00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:36.405
And then, for example, if I want that one,

50
00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:42.090
this is the string that I have to use,
pencil.circle.fill.

51
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.067
I don't want that one but
just for testing this,

52
00:03:46.067 --> 00:03:50.343
if I use pencil.circle.fill,
it appears there.

53
00:03:53.436 --> 00:03:59.297
Okay, I have already picked
a couple of icons, so

54
00:03:59.297 --> 00:04:07.685
I will just apply the tabItem modifier
to each children of the TabView.

55
00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:13.039
And we have homepage, we have offers,

56
00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:18.569
we have order, and we have info, okay?

57
00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:23.767
Well, for info,
I think I do want the icon info.

58
00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:30.159
And for the others, I have already spent
some time searching for the right icon.

59
00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.302
So I have cup and
saucer for the homepage,,

60
00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:42.352
Tag for offers and cart.

61
00:04:42.352 --> 00:04:47.409
So, sure for doing this, if you have

62
00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.468
the preview in an interactive mode,

63
00:04:52.468 --> 00:04:57.050
you can actually change the tab.

64
00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.825
And you see that.

65
00:04:58.825 --> 00:05:04.055
And I can get into the offer section,
that is the one that is ready.

66
00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:10.824
The cart, info, and homepage,
they are just text for now.

67
00:05:10.824 --> 00:05:14.364
But here,
you can see how easy is to have an app.

68
00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:19.845
Now, with tab navigation, you just
create a TabView with children, each

69
00:05:19.845 --> 00:05:25.849
children having a modifier with the name
tabItem that sets the image and the text.

70
00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.864
You can use images from here or
you can have your own PNG or

71
00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:32.014
SVG files with your own icon.

72
00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:35.014
What about the blue color?

73
00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:36.785
So you can see the tabs.

74
00:05:36.785 --> 00:05:37.862
They are blue.

75
00:05:37.862 --> 00:05:40.544
Where is this blue coming from?

76
00:05:40.544 --> 00:05:43.474
So I didn't set any color anywhere.

77
00:05:43.474 --> 00:05:47.257
And in my assets, I don't have any blue.

78
00:05:47.257 --> 00:05:51.880
So that's the default,
tint or accent color.

79
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.219
If you wanna change that,
probably you haven't seen that or

80
00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:56.793
you didn't pay attention.

81
00:05:56.793 --> 00:06:04.691
There was a color already set in my
AccentColor that has no content, no color.

82
00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:09.823
So because it has no color, actually
the tab is taking that AccentColor.

83
00:06:09.823 --> 00:06:13.462
If it's empty, the default is blue, okay?

84
00:06:13.462 --> 00:06:17.857
But I can change that,
and I can use the same

85
00:06:17.857 --> 00:06:22.387
secondary color or
any color that you like.

86
00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:24.105
So we can copy and paste.

87
00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:26.798
It has to have the name AccentColor, okay?

88
00:06:26.798 --> 00:06:28.916
So it's taking the color from there.

89
00:06:28.916 --> 00:06:33.816
So I'm going to click here, and the color,

90
00:06:33.816 --> 00:06:36.868
I can select one from here.

91
00:06:36.868 --> 00:06:42.377
Or I can even select a custom color and

92
00:06:42.377 --> 00:06:47.190
I'm going to see hexadecimal.

93
00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.331
So it can also be the green one,
anyone will work.

94
00:06:52.331 --> 00:06:57.620
And now from here, let's resume.

95
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.647
And now,
you can see it's not blue anymore.

96
00:07:01.647 --> 00:07:05.588
And the icon is changing as well,
because the icon, SF Symbols icons,

97
00:07:05.588 --> 00:07:09.479
will actually take foreground colors,
because they are like fonts.

98
00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.637
We're gonna apply font properties to it.

99
00:07:13.637 --> 00:07:14.758
So you change the accent color.

100
00:07:14.758 --> 00:07:18.024
Of course,
we have ways to manipulate that color and

101
00:07:18.024 --> 00:07:20.409
set the color individually per item.

102
00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:24.970
But we have, quickly, a nice behavior.
