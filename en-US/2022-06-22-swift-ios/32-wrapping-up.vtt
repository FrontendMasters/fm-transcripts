00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.191
If you wanna improve
this app a little bit,

2
00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:07.346
I have two bonuses that you can
check in the companion website.

3
00:00:07.346 --> 00:00:14.640
It's in section six, where you can
actually add likes with the LikeManager.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.730
You have the code here.

5
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.493
So you can test yourself to
see if you can make it work.

6
00:00:19.493 --> 00:00:22.875
And it's going to save it locally.

7
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:26.824
So you can actually make fabrics or
you can like elements,

8
00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:31.380
and next time you open the app,
it's going to appear.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.900
And also another is a filter.

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.850
A filter is to actually make
your list searchable, okay?

11
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.040
So you have here the code,

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.126
I wanna see if you are able to play
with this on your own, and make it work.

13
00:00:49.142 --> 00:00:54.285
If there are no more questions,
I think we can finish this course.

14
00:00:54.285 --> 00:01:00.068
I hope it was useful, you learn SwiftUI
and how to make iOS applications.

15
00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:05.266
And I hope to see your apps in the App
Store, making a lot of money, I guess.

16
00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.747
Thank you.

17
00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:11.285
