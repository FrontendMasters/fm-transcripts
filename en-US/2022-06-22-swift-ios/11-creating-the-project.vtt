1
00:00:00.651 --> 00:00:06.146
Now it's time to open Xcode and
create our first iOS application project.

2
00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:12.672
And for now if you to companion website,

3
00:00:12.672 --> 00:00:17.230
remember it's
firtmam.github.io/intro.swift.

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.452
Now we are going to be following
this table of contents.

5
00:00:22.452 --> 00:00:25.802
I'm not going to follow
the steps one by one, but

6
00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:30.460
in case you get lost at any time,
you can actually follow this also,

7
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.003
you have a link to GitHub
here in the introduction.

8
00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:35.049
Later you will have mine.

9
00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:39.266
So in case you have any problems,
you can follow Mac.

10
00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:46.398
So, now back in Xcode now,
we're going to get out of the playground.

11
00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:48.164
And we're going to create a new project.

12
00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:52.845
For that, find new project, okay?

13
00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:54.926
That's it.

14
00:00:54.926 --> 00:00:59.266
But here,
it's important to pick the right template.

15
00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:02.335
There are so many templates here.

16
00:01:02.335 --> 00:01:06.304
We need to pick iOS, so
make sure you have iOS and

17
00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:11.089
then the one that says App,
just that, that's simple.

18
00:01:11.089 --> 00:01:17.148
But there is also multiplatform app
in macOS app, in watchOS app, so

19
00:01:17.148 --> 00:01:23.638
that's why it's important to pick iOS,
and from iOS, app, then next.

20
00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:25.941
And here,
I'm going to zoom in a little bit.

21
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:31.495
So we can focus on these options
that we have in this form.

22
00:01:31.495 --> 00:01:34.375
While the product name is
the name of the app, so

23
00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:37.045
we're going to call these CoffeeMasters.

24
00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:39.892
Then it's asking me for a team.

25
00:01:39.892 --> 00:01:41.841
So what's the team?

26
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:45.422
For now we can just keep it as none, okay?

27
00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:49.757
The idea here is that if you
have an Apple Developer account,

28
00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:53.252
you can actually select
that account from here.

29
00:01:53.252 --> 00:01:56.497
You don't need to do that
while developing the app.

30
00:01:56.497 --> 00:01:58.182
You just need to select a theme.

31
00:01:58.182 --> 00:02:03.451
If you wanna compile the app for
the store, or if you wanna try

32
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:09.669
the app in your own iPhones or iPads,
if not we can just leave it as it is.

33
00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:13.523
Then, it's asking me for
an organization identifier.

34
00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:15.674
What's the deal with this?

35
00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:20.809
Every app in the App Store and
every app in the device has

36
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:25.615
a unique ID, it's a primary key,
it's a string.

37
00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:29.835
So we cannot have two apps
with the same ID, it's an ID.

38
00:02:29.835 --> 00:02:37.749
So how can we, let's say kind of guarantee
that we're not using an ID from other app?

39
00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:40.063
Typically, we use our URL or

40
00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:45.559
our company's URL in reverse order I mean,
it's not mandatory and

41
00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:51.555
nobody's actually going to check if
that entering the DNS exists or not.

42
00:02:51.555 --> 00:02:55.047
But for example, we can say conference and
masters, I can say,

43
00:02:55.047 --> 00:02:58.685
don't worship, even if it doesn't exist,
it doesn't matter.

44
00:02:58.685 --> 00:03:03.397
And then it's going to merge that
organization identifier with

45
00:03:03.397 --> 00:03:06.720
the product name,
we can change that later.

46
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.717
While we're not polishing the app,
we're actually running the app

47
00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:16.539
in our own computer or our own device,
the bundle identifier can be

48
00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:21.821
changed without any problem and
is not actually registered with Apple.

49
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.072
From the moment that you
actually compile the app for

50
00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:30.033
the store, or
you run the app on your own iPhone,

51
00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:35.066
actually you are registering
that ID In Apple's databases.

52
00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:38.711
So be careful if you're
using your company's name.

53
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:43.151
The first time you try
the app on your real iPhone,

54
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:49.285
what will happen is that,
that ID will register under your account,

55
00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:54.279
and that ID cannot be used on
any other app in the future.

56
00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:59.569
Interface, we have to select swift UI and
when we select swift UI,

57
00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.974
we don't have any other language option.

58
00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:08.196
When we use storyboard that
is actually part of UI kit.

59
00:04:08.196 --> 00:04:12.820
You can pick objective C, okay,
but we're not going to do that,

60
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.766
I'm going to use Swift UI.

61
00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:18.171
What about core data and testings?

62
00:04:18.171 --> 00:04:21.164
Right now for
today we don't need to add tests but

63
00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:25.926
you can add that later if you want,
that's UI testing and unit testing both.

64
00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:32.111
Core data, it's a framework from Apple for
data persistence.

65
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:36.756
So it's kind of similar to hibernate,
so it's a mapping system

66
00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:41.155
that will map objects to databases or
other data providers.

67
00:04:41.155 --> 00:04:45.204
We are not going to use it so
we will just keep this as it is.

68
00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:48.761
Next, now where are we
going to store that?

69
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:51.986
So I will just pick a folder in my Mac.

70
00:04:51.986 --> 00:04:56.629
And something that you may wanna
look into that is to create

71
00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.819
a git repository on my Mac.

72
00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.220
So you can actually select that or not.

73
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.060
So in this case,
you're going to have version control

74
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.703
locally in your computer,
if you click that thing.

75
00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:15.484
Create, and now our app is ready.

76
00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:19.668
Let's try to analyze first Xcode as an ID.

77
00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:23.066
So first we have a couple of panels, so

78
00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:27.434
we have a panel at the left,
a panel at the right.

79
00:05:27.434 --> 00:05:33.050
And there is also an optional
panel at the bottom,

80
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.401
these panels can be
collapsed with these little

81
00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:43.094
icons that you have here, here and here.

82
00:05:43.094 --> 00:05:45.309
There is no way to detach those panels.

83
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:49.096
You can just open them,
close them, and that's all.

84
00:05:49.096 --> 00:05:53.135
Don't try to move them,
isn't gonna work, okay?

85
00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:56.639
So if you have two monitors or
something like that,

86
00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:00.312
you can create a new window
with File &gt; New &gt; Window.

87
00:06:00.312 --> 00:06:01.298
And from there,

88
00:06:01.298 --> 00:06:05.959
you can actually have another window
that is connected to the same operation.

89
00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:08.899
Okay, but no more than that.

90
00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:14.815
Then I will focus now on the panel that we
have at the left really quickly, because

91
00:06:14.815 --> 00:06:20.224
the first time you see this is kind of
weird, the user interface is weird.

92
00:06:20.224 --> 00:06:22.784
So I'm going to zoom in here.

93
00:06:22.784 --> 00:06:24.635
And these are called the navigators.

94
00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:32.017
You don't feel like these are tabs,
but believe me, these are tabs.

95
00:06:32.017 --> 00:06:35.289
So if you click on these icons,
you are changing the tab.

96
00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.406
You are changing the navigator.

97
00:06:39.406 --> 00:06:45.451
The first one, it's the project navigator,
it's the one that you will use the most.

98
00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:49.296
The second one is the version
control navigator.

99
00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:52.074
Then we have some kind
of a class navigator or

100
00:06:52.074 --> 00:06:56.655
a structure navigator where you will
see all the contents that you have or

101
00:06:56.655 --> 00:06:59.376
the classes or the structure or the enums.

102
00:06:59.376 --> 00:07:04.356
Then we have a search navigator where
you can search within the project and

103
00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:07.969
issues navigator,
you will see here your warnings,

104
00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.958
all your errors, and also runtime errors.

105
00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:11.790
Then test,

106
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.637
this is a test navigator because we didn't
include a test project or a test target.

107
00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.584
We don't have anything there.

108
00:07:19.584 --> 00:07:23.929
This one is going to use for debugging.

109
00:07:23.929 --> 00:07:26.414
Then we have breakpoints,
the breakpoint navigator.

110
00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:28.745
And finally the output navigator,

111
00:07:28.745 --> 00:07:34.038
where you will see all the outputs every
time you run, you have a console output.

112
00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:36.864
So here you can see all those logs.

113
00:07:36.864 --> 00:07:42.349
Okay, so just to understand
what's going on on that side.

114
00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:46.988
At the right you have what
is known as inspectors,

115
00:07:46.988 --> 00:07:51.517
to be honest when you're
working with Swift UI,

116
00:07:51.517 --> 00:07:58.705
we don't use the inspector panel a lot
because we have other better options.

117
00:07:58.705 --> 00:08:03.846
So typically, I'm talking about
these panel that you close or

118
00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:05.593
open with this icon.

119
00:08:05.593 --> 00:08:11.717
Typically we're not going to use it,
so we can just hide it, okay.

120
00:08:11.717 --> 00:08:17.718
And the one at the bottom that
can be managed by that icon,

121
00:08:17.718 --> 00:08:21.854
that little icon there are the bottom.

122
00:08:21.854 --> 00:08:25.008
We don't need that at this point,
so we can just hide, okay.

123
00:08:25.008 --> 00:08:30.039
Then, in the middle of the ID,
we have the editor.

124
00:08:30.039 --> 00:08:35.466
Right now, the editor is opened in
one file, with the name contact me.

125
00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:40.566
We don't see here file extensions but
because of the icon we

126
00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:45.570
have the little bird there
that's actually a swift file.

127
00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.088
So we have content view
is actually a swift file,

128
00:08:50.088 --> 00:08:56.716
if you do one click over filings
you're just changing the current tab.

129
00:08:56.716 --> 00:09:02.015
If you double click on the file, you're
actually fixing that file in the tab,

130
00:09:02.015 --> 00:09:07.234
so, it's actually difficult to see,
but now content view it's in italic,

131
00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:12.078
I'm not sure if you realize that,
if you double click now it's fixed.

132
00:09:12.078 --> 00:09:16.023
So that means that if I click on
another file it's a new tab, okay.

133
00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:20.549
So you need to get used to this because
it's different from either IDs, so

134
00:09:20.549 --> 00:09:22.812
double click will create a new tab and

135
00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:27.791
a single click will actually open a tab or
share the tab between different files.

136
00:09:27.791 --> 00:09:30.302
Fortunately for us, these days,

137
00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:35.591
when we create a new project with
Swift UI, we don't have a lot of files.

138
00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:39.703
Okay, so we have just a file,
let's say you file for

139
00:09:39.703 --> 00:09:44.946
now with the name assets, okay,
we will see how to work with this.

140
00:09:44.946 --> 00:09:48.758
Then we have some kind of a folder
known as preview content,

141
00:09:48.758 --> 00:09:50.753
we'll talk about that later.

142
00:09:50.753 --> 00:09:56.774
And then two thrift files,
CoffeeMastersApp, and content B.

143
00:09:56.774 --> 00:09:57.855
That's all.

144
00:09:57.855 --> 00:09:58.790
That's all we have.
