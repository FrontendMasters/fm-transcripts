1
00:00:00.437 --> 00:00:07.711
So actually our app is ready,
for primetime is finished.

2
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:12.591
There only one missing piece
that is actually simple.

3
00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:16.573
That has to do with before
polishing the app, we need an icon,

4
00:00:16.573 --> 00:00:22.023
because right now we don't have an icon,
it's going to be rejected from the store.

5
00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:28.577
So that's a simple thing and
in the assets, there is an app icon

6
00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:34.763
Thing there with empty places.

7
00:00:34.763 --> 00:00:42.483
You need to fill these places manually
with the icon in different formats.

8
00:00:42.483 --> 00:00:48.363
In the assets folder,
you already have all these icons in

9
00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:53.520
all the formats manually dragging and
dropping.

10
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.785
I'm just going to paste,
first, why there are so many?

11
00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:02.604
Because it's asking me for
iPhone and iPad icons, but

12
00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:06.899
we mentioned that we don't
wanna cover iPad, so

13
00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:13.415
I can click in the app icon here,
open the inspector and say you know what?

14
00:01:13.415 --> 00:01:18.502
I don't want iPad, I know we have less,
we still have a lot, but less.

15
00:01:18.502 --> 00:01:23.277
So there is a bigger one for the Appstore,
then thre four, so we just need to drag.

16
00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:32.690
Drag, okay,
if you at least fill these two,

17
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.221
you're probably good for the emulator.

18
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:43.473
Okay, the Appstore,
when you submit these to the Appstore,

19
00:01:43.473 --> 00:01:47.412
it will complain that you
need all of them, but

20
00:01:47.412 --> 00:01:51.664
I need 120, so drag and
180 for the iPhone.

21
00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:53.137
So if you run the app again.

22
00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:01.559
Now it has its icon, or maybe not.

23
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:02.504
It appeared right?

24
00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:05.189
It seems like a bug, who got that?

25
00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.017
Let me do this, right click,

26
00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:13.344
remove the app from the simulator and
then run it again.

27
00:02:13.344 --> 00:02:18.161
Maybe it's messing with
the cache within the simulator.

28
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:20.866
And there we have it, and are we done?

29
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.845
No, we still have a minute.

30
00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:27.001
Launcher screen, the launcher screen,

31
00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:32.149
it's something that appears when
you open it up for the first time.

32
00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:36.661
Okay, to set the launch screen it's,

33
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:41.583
you have the steps in the last chapter,
but

34
00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:46.520
you need to open,
let me close all of this.

35
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.724
You need to click in the project and
go to a section known as info.

36
00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:57.542
So in the project settings,
we go to info, within info, okay,

37
00:02:57.542 --> 00:03:00.180
there are some metadata here.

38
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.619
This interface is terrible.

39
00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:08.557
Okay, so I'm sorry Apple, but
this part of Xcode is terrible.

40
00:03:08.557 --> 00:03:11.869
So I'm going to zoom in so
you can actually see what's going on.

41
00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.144
What I need to do is create a new key,
how do you create a key?

42
00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:20.884
By using these little plus sign
that appears when you hove,okay?

43
00:03:20.884 --> 00:03:25.788
So yeah, so you hover and there is
a plus sign, so you click there, and

44
00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:28.793
then you say okay,
what do you want to add?

45
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:29.697
What metadata?

46
00:03:29.697 --> 00:03:32.478
So launch screen.

47
00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:36.276
Do I replace it?

48
00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:41.007
Yes, okay, so,
now I need to put keys inside this, and

49
00:03:41.007 --> 00:03:43.441
here comes the tricky part.

50
00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:49.673
If you hit plus, it's creating
actually a sibling to Launch Screen.

51
00:03:49.673 --> 00:03:54.332
It's not what I want,
I need to add children.

52
00:03:54.332 --> 00:04:01.076
So to do that, first you need to
click in that arrow, okay, magic.

53
00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:05.620
So you clicking that arrow,
and now the arrow looks down,

54
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.367
and now you can add things here,
such as a background color.

55
00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:16.883
So you pick a color from your assets,
like I know the primary or the secondary,

56
00:04:16.883 --> 00:04:22.543
the name of the color, and the name
of the image that you want to add.

57
00:04:22.543 --> 00:04:27.324
I think I have another image
that we haven't used so

58
00:04:27.324 --> 00:04:33.447
far that we can add in the assets for
this, this gold splash logo.

59
00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:38.298
So I can add the PDF there, splash logo.

60
00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:43.604
Just remember that by default
it's giving me three versions,

61
00:04:43.604 --> 00:04:48.320
and I need to change that here
in scales to single scale.

62
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.193
Okay, so, splash logo we can
change these to splash or launch,

63
00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:58.090
the name, any name will work,
just remember the name you used.

64
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.772
And finally, we can come here and
say that the image,

65
00:05:02.772 --> 00:05:09.345
we don't have a selector here, so
we just need to just type this manually.

66
00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:12.848
Unfortunately, this is like hard work,
and now do you see that?

67
00:05:12.848 --> 00:05:16.368
Was really quickly,
in fact, if it's so quickly,

68
00:05:16.368 --> 00:05:20.608
we can go to the simulator debug and
activate slow animations.

69
00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:26.273
So now everything will be slow,
too slow actually,

70
00:05:26.273 --> 00:05:33.248
but actually you can see the splash
screen launch image, okay?

71
00:05:33.248 --> 00:05:37.540
And that's the end of our app,
your app is ready for the Appstore.
