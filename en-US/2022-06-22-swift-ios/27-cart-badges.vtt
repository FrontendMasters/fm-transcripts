1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.540
What's next?

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.760
It should do that we have here,
the Button.

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.306
We need to add this to the cart,

4
00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:12.640
I know at this point is sounds like
too scary, okay, so where is the card?

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.549
We have a CartManager remember,
this is our CartManager right now.

6
00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:22.589
What if we create a function like add

7
00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:28.472
that receives the product and quantity.

8
00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:34.360
And we are just going to, as a best
practice to not allow from the outside

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.873
to touch my array something like that,
so we going to just append.

10
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:45.590
It's append and
we're going to create a pair.

11
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.090
Remember this is actually
a tuple of two elements.

12
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.754
We create one with the arguments and
we append that to the cart,

13
00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:56.940
does it make sense?

14
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.479
Also just because we are here, we have
add, we can remove that receives product.

15
00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.208
So remove, there are many ways
to remove that one that I would

16
00:01:10.208 --> 00:01:15.306
like to show you how to use is that,
you can remove all with where,

17
00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:19.190
and what is where, what type is that?

18
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.850
&gt;&gt; It throws, it's yet to be, it's a type
of Boolean, but you have to handle that.

19
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.730
&gt;&gt; What is that?

20
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:26.850
A closure.

21
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.480
&gt;&gt; A closure.

22
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.387
&gt;&gt; So if I click there, actually I'm going
to receive the pair, let's say the item

23
00:01:32.387 --> 00:01:37.470
in cart, I need to return true or false,
if you need to delete that or not.

24
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.263
So I'm going to return If
the item in cart.0.id,

25
00:01:43.263 --> 00:01:47.739
for example is equal to product.id, so

26
00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:53.790
if it's the same product, okay, delete it.

27
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.548
And also just because I'm here,

28
00:01:56.548 --> 00:02:01.380
I may want to calculate the total,
well we can do it later.

29
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.370
So, now that's the CartManager,
okay, so in my details page.

30
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470
Now, how can I access that
CartManager from here?

31
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.390
What do you think?

32
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.296
Does anyone know how can I access
the CartManager from a view Environment

33
00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.170
option, sure that's correct.

34
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.210
So I need to create an Environmentobject
that is going to be a dependency, okay.

35
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.840
There's going to be cart called
CartManager = CartManager.

36
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.640
Remember that we have already
injected this at the app level.

37
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.520
And now probably my, let me do it again.

38
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.514
We don't need to insert this, so

39
00:02:43.514 --> 00:02:48.510
we just need to create the variable and
define the type that's all.

40
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.802
And also probably my preview
will crash now, why?

41
00:02:53.802 --> 00:02:55.070
&gt;&gt; Because you're not injecting that.

42
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.414
&gt;&gt; Because we need to inject that here,
as well.

43
00:02:58.414 --> 00:03:03.135
So there it's it, taking a while,
but now [LAUGH] it's crushing,

44
00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:07.940
so I need to add
the Environmentobject to CartManager.

45
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.818
So you know that the value you're
getting the idea of how this works, so

46
00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:14.210
now it's working.

47
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:20.600
So now that I do have the CartManager, I
just need to call out, what's the product?

48
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.558
The product was the quantity,

49
00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:29.484
the properties that I do have in my view,
okay, makes sense?

50
00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:34.040
So how do we know if this is working?

51
00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.920
Well, we can see if
the card has something, but

52
00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.020
let me show you something
really quickly and nice.

53
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.304
So it gives us some endorphins, so

54
00:03:43.304 --> 00:03:49.140
if you go to contribute remember
that we have the tabs here.

55
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.781
So in other tabs, the tab item,
we can also change a property,

56
00:03:53.781 --> 00:03:55.630
it's called the badge.

57
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.280
The badge is a little number
that appears with the top.

58
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.252
So, and we can ask the CartManager how
many items do we have in the cart, right?

59
00:04:09.252 --> 00:04:12.604
So how can I access
a CartManager from here,

60
00:04:12.604 --> 00:04:18.140
from the content view the same
Environmentobjects on every view.

61
00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.864
That when I get data from that cart,
we need to do the same thing,

62
00:04:23.864 --> 00:04:29.550
Environmentobject CartManager
of type CartManager.

63
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:38.294
So now we can connect this in the badge
to the CartManager.cart.count.

64
00:04:41.437 --> 00:04:47.170
Will work, we'll see, while our preview
will probably have the same problem,

65
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.075
because I need to inject in the preview,
okay, but let's run this.

66
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:58.796
Here, so I'm getting to Black Americano,
cross your fingers Black Americano,

67
00:04:58.796 --> 00:05:02.831
I knew I don't have the description,
I should add the description.

68
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:08.886
So let's add to the cart or one wherever
it's the same, add 1 to the cart,

69
00:05:08.886 --> 00:05:13.620
look at that got a little nice
one badge that we have there.

70
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:21.064
So, let's try to remember what we have
here, so we are the Button is talking

71
00:05:21.064 --> 00:05:27.000
to an injective Environmentobject
that has a published array.

72
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.976
And then, another view in the hierarchy
that has nothing to do with the details is

73
00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:32.791
connected.

74
00:05:32.791 --> 00:05:40.042
They're automatically updated,
so if I go back now and

75
00:05:40.042 --> 00:05:45.297
I select flat wider and more flat wider.

76
00:05:45.297 --> 00:05:47.520
It's actually not taking the quantity, so

77
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.196
three will actually say 2 here at
the bottom, okay, but that's fine.

78
00:05:51.196 --> 00:05:56.292
We can change that if we want,
okay it makes sense, so if I go to

79
00:05:56.292 --> 00:06:02.280
orders page now, hey, it doesn't look so
bad, we have to Hello words.

80
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.556
Okay, that's because we didn't
finish the item, the guard item, but

81
00:06:08.556 --> 00:06:09.849
it's kind of okay.

82
00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:14.940
We have 2, we have a forum,
we still need to add the total, okay.

83
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.759
&gt;&gt; Okay, now this is great, I'm just
saying I think items is still have

84
00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.844
probably issue if you went multiple times.

85
00:06:22.844 --> 00:06:28.390
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we should solve, let's make
that to do for home homework, but

86
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:35.140
yeah the problem is that we are treating,
now the product as a key also in the list.

87
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.644
So actually, if you're adding
twice then we have a problem.

88
00:06:39.644 --> 00:06:41.222
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it's easy to change.

89
00:06:41.222 --> 00:06:42.170
&gt;&gt; It's easy to change.

90
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.040
&gt;&gt; You need go to the add.

91
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.875
&gt;&gt; You just have to remove-
&gt;&gt; And first check if it's there,

92
00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:49.830
if it's there as you need to adjust sum
the quantity, so add to the quantity.

93
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.053
So it's not a big deal, but yeah,

94
00:06:52.053 --> 00:06:55.210
I think you got a idea of
how to solve the problem.

95
00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.940
But I mean,
I think it looks like an app, right?

96
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.844
So let's finish the missing pieces,

97
00:07:02.844 --> 00:07:07.242
first the details page is not showing the.

98
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.313
Description, I don't think
we have the text for

99
00:07:13.313 --> 00:07:17.780
the description for
some reason, so let's add it.

100
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.800
I can just clone the product name and
add the description here.

101
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.372
So we can change the color, for
example let's say the foreground color.

102
00:07:29.372 --> 00:07:35.987
How do you take a color library,
colors and I will pick on the primary.

103
00:07:39.236 --> 00:07:44.465
&gt;&gt; Something like that,
so now Black Americano,

104
00:07:44.465 --> 00:07:50.400
we see in red the description,
okay, so that works.

105
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.448
So the next step is to actually see
something better in the cart for

106
00:07:57.448 --> 00:08:01.548
the item, and we're kind of there for

107
00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:07.430
the cart and
we have the info section pending.

108
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:12.169
So we just need to create something
better here in order items, so

109
00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:17.789
it's actually not a big deal, before
doing that, do you have any question?

110
00:08:26.358 --> 00:08:26.955
No.

111
00:08:30.157 --> 00:08:33.338
Okay, so we need to replace this text and

112
00:08:33.338 --> 00:08:39.470
before actually doing something else,
we need some dependencies.

113
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:42.391
Jack Charlie you render,
I know that I am, what do we need?

114
00:08:42.391 --> 00:08:45.613
&gt;&gt; Environmental,

115
00:08:45.613 --> 00:08:50.060
I forget-
&gt;&gt; We have karma share or

116
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.532
we have menu-man share, which one?

117
00:08:54.532 --> 00:08:59.851
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; We will need that, but you're right,

118
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:04.921
but for the wrong reason,
let me show you why?

119
00:09:04.921 --> 00:09:09.981
Well, we need to actually render
the data is actually the item and

120
00:09:09.981 --> 00:09:14.213
the item is of type, pair or
tuple of product integer,

121
00:09:14.213 --> 00:09:17.160
that's actually what we need.

122
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.853
Okay, for rendering at least, but
we will need for in just two minutes.

123
00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:24.977
Okay, so when we have the item of course,

124
00:09:24.977 --> 00:09:29.890
it's given me an error here because now
I need to pass the item in the premium.

125
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.760
Every time you have
a dependency like this,

126
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.884
you actually need to add this here,
so I need a pair of product.

127
00:09:39.876 --> 00:09:45.359
Okay, and again you can create
your own dummy data framework or

128
00:09:45.359 --> 00:09:49.913
mock data framework,
is not complicated but okay,

129
00:09:49.913 --> 00:09:53.135
this is Dummy with the price 125.

130
00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:59.460
Now image, I don't care about the image,
what is that?

131
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.714
The body, I don't know what's that,
but I don't need that,

132
00:10:03.714 --> 00:10:08.670
so this is closing product,
I need to close order item, okay.

133
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.460
So, now we need to render something here,
okay, and

134
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:17.851
if you remember the idea is to create,
like in the same row different items,

135
00:10:17.851 --> 00:10:21.748
so it's going to be an edge stack,
horizontal stack.

136
00:10:21.748 --> 00:10:27.628
So, I'm gonna try place for now,
three text, one with the quantity,

137
00:10:27.628 --> 00:10:34.120
so I will take from the item.1, the second
argument is a integer with an x.

138
00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.127
You will see it in a minute,

139
00:10:38.127 --> 00:10:43.006
then we want the product name, so

140
00:10:43.006 --> 00:10:50.820
it's .0.name and the price or
maybe the total.

141
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:57.354
So it's going to be the \(item.1)

142
00:10:57.354 --> 00:11:04.070
multiply by item.0.price, okay.

143
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.930
Remember this is a tuple,
so we're using 0 and 1.

144
00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.490
If we want to make this better,

145
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:11.440
we can put names in the top or
we'd see that in the morning.

146
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.184
Also we are seeing an error because we
need to convert the quantity to double,

147
00:11:17.184 --> 00:11:18.140
topping it up.

148
00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:25.741
So if we assume is to get an error
here because, I'm missing the,

149
00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:30.899
yeah, you're right,
the quantity it's a double.

150
00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:36.597
Let's see.

151
00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:47.123
We have item, let's do some parentheses,
you can see it's complicated,

152
00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:51.372
that's why it's better to actually
do this in a different file.

153
00:11:52.828 --> 00:11:56.365
Below fail, okay.

154
00:11:56.365 --> 00:12:02.167
Resume, we are still getting an error but
somewhere else,

155
00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:09.090
were probably in the orders page
because the orders page, okay.

156
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:14.111
When it's not empty it's
actually rendering,

157
00:12:14.111 --> 00:12:20.120
let's scroll order item and
now order item needs an item.

158
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:22.760
Where is the item?

159
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.646
Well, we were looping here over
those items, there is a for

160
00:12:27.646 --> 00:12:33.043
each, okay, this is similar as
what we did before with the menu.

161
00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:35.199
Okay, so now order item,

162
00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:40.698
let's see if we can receive the preview,
okay, looks like that.

163
00:12:40.698 --> 00:12:44.049
Something that I wanna show you is
an element that we have used in different

164
00:12:44.049 --> 00:12:47.070
places, but we haven't explained that one.

165
00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:50.710
Also we can add a dollar
sign to the price and

166
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.072
specifier as we did before as always for
the float.

167
00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:04.110
On the other item it's called spacer,
it's ABU, what's a spacer?

168
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:09.368
And the flexible element that is actually
pushing as much as possible by default,

169
00:13:09.368 --> 00:13:11.510
so it's just pushing elements.

170
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:16.350
So as you can see here,
it's pushing the elements.

171
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:19.535
So it's doing that, so this reminds me,

172
00:13:19.535 --> 00:13:25.183
I'm not sure if you have been there,
we're doing websites in the 90s.

173
00:13:25.183 --> 00:13:29.488
Where we have a pixel.GIF file that was

174
00:13:29.488 --> 00:13:34.706
actually doing this,
to push a div before CSS,

175
00:13:34.706 --> 00:13:40.220
before we could actually
set divs with CSS.

176
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.391
So yeah,
maybe we can add some patterns, so

177
00:13:43.391 --> 00:13:46.730
we can add padding to the whole edge tag.

178
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:51.719
And by the way,
we are also missing the Delete Button,

179
00:13:51.719 --> 00:13:54.984
was the Delete Button, any image?

180
00:13:56.762 --> 00:14:01.680
Image, can we use someone like trash?

181
00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:03.106
We do have a trash?

182
00:14:03.106 --> 00:14:07.402
Yeah, if you wanna change the size,

183
00:14:07.402 --> 00:14:12.800
like this, you can also do that as a font.

184
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.011
If you want a big one, like so,
we're gonna add some padding,

185
00:14:17.011 --> 00:14:21.660
and we can change the foreground color,
which color?

186
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.300
No, any color, let's pick one,
secondary or primary?

187
00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.995
Not sure if you see that, but
that's actually in that color.

188
00:14:33.995 --> 00:14:38.288
Okay, it's not a Button, so
how can I detect gestures on

189
00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:43.450
something that is not a Button
it doesn't have a handler?

190
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:47.380
Well, gestures are you would like
that because it's really webby.

191
00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:51.875
There are modifiers starting
with on like events, and

192
00:14:51.875 --> 00:14:56.954
there is not unclick,
sorry because this is a mobile device,

193
00:14:56.954 --> 00:15:00.780
now how the event is
called the mobile device?

194
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:08.757
OnTap, so
we have onTapGesture with a code, and.

195
00:15:10.281 --> 00:15:11.780
What do you think that we need to do here?

196
00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:15.588
&gt;&gt; Color.

197
00:15:15.588 --> 00:15:18.750
&gt;&gt; It's to remove
&gt;&gt; Remove it from where?

198
00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.620
&gt;&gt; CartManager.

199
00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:22.540
&gt;&gt; From the CartManager,
how can I add the CartManager?

200
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:23.950
How can I use the CardManager here?

201
00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.140
&gt;&gt; Put the environmental
variable in there.

202
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:32.308
&gt;&gt; Environmentobject,
you learn Swift UI, so

203
00:15:32.308 --> 00:15:37.810
we need a CartManager of type CartManager.

204
00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:43.673
And from here,
we are going to talk with that manager,

205
00:15:43.673 --> 00:15:47.751
and we'll say remove which product,

206
00:15:47.751 --> 00:15:54.390
the one that we have item.0,
sorry, that's the product.

207
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:59.527
If everything works,
it will automatically update whatever

208
00:15:59.527 --> 00:16:04.576
UI you have that is pointing to
that array of objects, okay.

209
00:16:04.576 --> 00:16:08.938
&gt;&gt; If item.0 is that the first item-
&gt;&gt; Is the first item of the tuple, so

210
00:16:08.938 --> 00:16:14.412
.0 is product, remember you can have names
here as well to the type if you want.

211
00:16:14.412 --> 00:16:20.131
Well, now if I add to Americanos
we see the order there,

212
00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:24.402
if Macchiato was one, we go to the order.

213
00:16:24.402 --> 00:16:29.255
Well it doesn't look so bad,
maybe that padding that we added was not

214
00:16:29.255 --> 00:16:33.030
necessary because the list
has a padding by default.

215
00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:37.937
And also there is list style modifier,
we can change the list style, but

216
00:16:37.937 --> 00:16:39.640
you get the idea.

217
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.599
So I'm talking about these padding
is probably not necessary,

218
00:16:42.599 --> 00:16:46.550
because there will be a padding there,
how to solve the problem in the preview.

219
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.888
Well, you can just add the paddy here,
just for the preview,

220
00:16:50.888 --> 00:16:55.394
like saying, hey, your context
there will be a padding later,

221
00:16:55.394 --> 00:16:58.760
okay, just to look at it better there.

222
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.950
So let's see, what do you think,
what would happen if I click there?

223
00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.663
Will it work?

224
00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:12.608
Yeah, let's see, it worked,
also it updated the number there.

225
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:20.140
Okay, so it's actually working,
it's actually working.

226
00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.230
And if I delete the last
one my order is empty, so

227
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:27.621
the whole page is being re-rendered.

228
00:17:27.621 --> 00:17:34.138
And there was an If there in
the orders page there is an If and

229
00:17:34.138 --> 00:17:41.070
when the count is zero automatically
it's rendering a text.

230
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:45.453
The only missing pieces that
we don't have the total, but

231
00:17:45.453 --> 00:17:51.276
it's actually pretty simple, I mean
the final the total of the whole order.

232
00:17:51.276 --> 00:17:55.576
We can quickly create
the CartManager function by the way,

233
00:17:55.576 --> 00:18:00.360
let me first commit this in
case you want to get my code.

234
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.759
So let's say the orders
page kinda working.

235
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:12.526
And push to remote us well,
again later you have some homework you

236
00:18:12.526 --> 00:18:18.660
can move the site some more styling
to that, but It actually works.

237
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:23.620
So I need a function here that
will calculate the total, okay.

238
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.624
By the way, it's already here,
if you wanna take it from here,

239
00:18:27.624 --> 00:18:29.120
great in Data Manager.

240
00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:35.900
It's not a big deal, [LAUGH] because
you know how to program I guess.

241
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:42.462
This is just looping through all
the items and I think it's called cart,

242
00:18:42.462 --> 00:18:46.615
so it's going through all the items and
making the total.

243
00:18:46.615 --> 00:18:52.248
So now we can just call this
from the order page in fact,

244
00:18:52.248 --> 00:18:57.759
I did have that one but
I commented that CartManager,

245
00:18:57.759 --> 00:19:02.780
the total with some spacers so
it can look at this I

246
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.946
have a spacer, a text,
spacer, text, spacer.

247
00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:12.607
There are other ways to do this, but
this is one way to do a flexible UI,

248
00:19:12.607 --> 00:19:16.330
in this case is like when
you're using Flexbox, okay.

249
00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.559
And in this case you have an empty
item that is actually pushing, so

250
00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:24.430
they're fighting for
the space all of them.

251
00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:29.090
So, let's see cross your fingers, I don't
think you need to cross your fingers,

252
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.900
I trust them.

253
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.597
This site will allow this.

254
00:19:35.411 --> 00:19:40.416
One more and we have the total and
it seems to be working,

255
00:19:40.416 --> 00:19:46.180
if I delete the Americano it's
been updated everything works.
