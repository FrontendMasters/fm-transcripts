WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.942
And now we're going to start
working with our pression.

2
00:00:02.942 --> 00:00:05.102
Here we have that greeting structure and

3
00:00:05.102 --> 00:00:07.970
the greeting structure is
actually in the same file.

4
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.678
Can we put that in a separate file?

5
00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:11.778
Yes, we can.

6
00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.331
And typically we are gonna do
that not in every situation, but

7
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.707
on a lot of situations.

8
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:20.768
So now what we're gonna do is one,

9
00:00:20.768 --> 00:00:27.081
be like greeting that it's
going to be called offer.

10
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:30.552
Okay, let me see if I have it here.

11
00:00:30.552 --> 00:00:34.670
It's gonna represent from
our app these screens.

12
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.639
So this is an offer,
this is another offer.

13
00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:42.461
Okay, so we're going to
render that piece of content.

14
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:48.225
So to do that, I don't need this
structure I can keep that comment.

15
00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:52.087
Otherwise give me an error because
you need something in the body.

16
00:00:52.087 --> 00:00:53.757
It can be empty.

17
00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:57.735
There is a view called empty view
that renders nothing, just for

18
00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:02.020
this purpose just for saying, okay,
I don't have it not right now.

19
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.531
So if you don't want to see an error,

20
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:09.150
you can use empty view saying it's
like an empty div in HTML, okay?

21
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.010
Something like that.

22
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.726
So we don't have an error,
why we are writing the rest of the code,

23
00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:18.785
that I if I resume I'm going
to say nothing on the screen.

24
00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:21.540
So how to create a new view.

25
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.169
Right click in the project,
new file or file new file that simple.

26
00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:34.348
Here we have two options,
we can use swift file, a new swift file.

27
00:01:34.348 --> 00:01:37.527
But typically we want the Swift UI view.

28
00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:42.490
So there is a section for user interface
and within there we have swift UI view.

29
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.464
That's just greater template.

30
00:01:45.464 --> 00:01:46.881
Okay, it's not a big deal.

31
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.441
I mean if you don't have
it you can do it manually.

32
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.489
So I'm going to select a swift UI view.

33
00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:56.882
And I'm going to call this offer.

34
00:01:56.882 --> 00:02:02.362
You have these steps also
in the companion website.

35
00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:07.199
So here you can see that we have an
structure offer with a color war similar

36
00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:11.735
to what we had before and also we
have an a structure for the preview.

37
00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:16.637
So what's the deal here that
by default is paused we can

38
00:02:16.637 --> 00:02:20.589
always resume this and
see the hello world.

39
00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:26.089
So now each file has its own preview.

40
00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:32.044
So we can preview the whole app or
shaft on a small piece of it.

41
00:02:32.044 --> 00:02:37.503
And the idea is because we are going
to create reusable components,

42
00:02:37.503 --> 00:02:42.691
we can be surely test and
preview each component individually.

43
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:47.604
And now we will get deeper with that.

44
00:02:47.604 --> 00:02:52.827
So the offer will have two properties,
a title that is gonna be a string so

45
00:02:52.827 --> 00:02:56.869
we're gonna start with empty string and
description.

46
00:02:56.869 --> 00:03:01.444
Remember that you can set
the type explicitly are not up to

47
00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:05.933
you because I'm setting
a default value in jazz works.

48
00:03:05.933 --> 00:03:10.682
So and they will have two text,
one showing the title and

49
00:03:10.682 --> 00:03:13.627
the other one with a description.

50
00:03:13.627 --> 00:03:14.978
Let's start with that.

51
00:03:14.978 --> 00:03:21.878
But as we know, we cannot create two
text if we don't have a container.

52
00:03:21.878 --> 00:03:24.969
Okay, so we always need a container here.

53
00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:29.121
If we wanna render this,
remember what we are trying to achieve.

54
00:03:29.121 --> 00:03:30.759
One takes on the other text.

55
00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:35.230
So we can just create a B stack,
a vertical stack.

56
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.782
So I can add it manually.

57
00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:43.096
I can drag it from here, B stack.

58
00:03:43.096 --> 00:03:45.137
I'm sorry, I'm in modifiers here.

59
00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:47.019
They stack.

60
00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.719
Blasi are not neither need lazy.

61
00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.387
I can drag it there or
there it's just the same or

62
00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:57.620
you can probably faster to write it but
it's up to you.

63
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.593
Which version do you want.

64
00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:03.788
So I have a text with a title and
a text with a description.

65
00:04:03.788 --> 00:04:10.820
And this is the part where we are going
to start digging into the preview,

66
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.868
this preview provider that we have here.

67
00:04:14.868 --> 00:04:16.960
So, I'm going to resume the preview.

68
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.808
And one of the problems that I
have is that I don't see anything.

69
00:04:23.758 --> 00:04:26.830
Do you know why?

70
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.455
Why it's empty?

71
00:04:29.455 --> 00:04:31.383
Because it's rings are empty.

72
00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:36.238
Yeah, so the idea is that I wanan
modify the strings from the outside,

73
00:04:36.238 --> 00:04:38.555
the tittle and the description.

74
00:04:38.555 --> 00:04:43.199
Well actually the preview is code.

75
00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.816
It's actually this code.

76
00:04:44.816 --> 00:04:47.025
It's actually another view.

77
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:51.755
We define the preview on how do we
wanna preview this in this second

78
00:04:51.755 --> 00:04:53.910
structure that we have here.

79
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.721
And here we have an offer,
the offer because

80
00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:03.533
it's under structure has an initializer so

81
00:05:03.533 --> 00:05:09.009
I can set its title and
its description from here.

82
00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.963
So this is my offer and

83
00:05:12.963 --> 00:05:17.367
this is a description.

84
00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:25.479
So I can actually set my preview however
I want directly in the other structure so

85
00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.090
we save the information
from previous here.

86
00:05:33.903 --> 00:05:39.480
Also talking about previews, let's discuss

87
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.348
a minute about the properties
that we have here.

88
00:05:45.348 --> 00:05:50.208
So for example if we start with the cycle
well we know that this play button

89
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:52.928
makes the preview interactive, okay?

90
00:05:52.928 --> 00:05:59.528
The second one it's actually connected
with human error here to a real life and

91
00:05:59.528 --> 00:06:06.139
so I can actually preview this on my real
iPhone which is actually pretty cool.

92
00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.324
And you don't see the whole app,
just the current view on your real iPhone.

93
00:06:10.324 --> 00:06:13.298
That's the second icon if
you don't have the icon or

94
00:06:13.298 --> 00:06:17.632
if it's disabled is because you don't
have an iPhone connected or an iPad.

95
00:06:17.632 --> 00:06:22.660
Then we have,
we can see these in landscape.

96
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.737
So we are changing the orientation
apart look at this If I'm changing

97
00:06:26.737 --> 00:06:30.476
the orientation in the preview,
what is changing is the code.

98
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.345
It's actually a modifier.

99
00:06:37.345 --> 00:06:43.470
Also we have now this little icon here
that lets me pick a lot of options.

100
00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.214
For example,
what if I see this in dark mode?

101
00:06:49.622 --> 00:06:55.040
I can see how my view
looks like in dark mode.

102
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.122
And what if I wanna see both dark mode and
light mode.

103
00:06:59.122 --> 00:07:04.061
But before doing that,
we are seeing here a big iPhone,

104
00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:07.328
but our view will not be fullscreen.

105
00:07:07.328 --> 00:07:11.357
We have smaller like a piece of content,
okay?

106
00:07:11.357 --> 00:07:16.464
So that's why if using the same icon,
this one,

107
00:07:16.464 --> 00:07:23.700
I can set up the preview, the device
that you wanna see or the layout.

108
00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.468
So I can instead of using
the device I can use fixed.

109
00:07:27.468 --> 00:07:32.738
So I can say here that
they want these layouts

110
00:07:32.738 --> 00:07:37.590
to be 300 points, 300 by 200.

111
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:40.331
Any number, okay?

112
00:07:40.331 --> 00:07:43.595
And this is actually changing
the properties here.

113
00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:46.450
I mean decrease the font
size a little bit.

114
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:52.359
So you can play with this, yeah no,
300 no, 350, okay you got it.

115
00:07:52.359 --> 00:07:56.180
So now my preview is on that size.

116
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:02.808
And I think you gonna like this, because
this is pretty useful for testing as well.

117
00:08:02.808 --> 00:08:11.230
We are kind of creating UI test case
using the last icon that we have there.

118
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:18.500
We can duplicate this and
now we have two previews of the same view.

119
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.599
Now we have a group with two offers.

120
00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:26.476
And yeah this one can be a smaller or
we can see okay,

121
00:08:26.476 --> 00:08:33.860
how it looks like in 400 or how it looked
in light mode instead of dark mode.

122
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:39.643
And I can have as many previous as I
want to express different situations,

123
00:08:39.643 --> 00:08:44.586
so I can see how my view will look
like in different situations,

124
00:08:44.586 --> 00:08:49.180
different screen sizes, or
different container sizes.

125
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.905
And there are more properties
that you can change.

126
00:08:53.905 --> 00:08:55.480
You can change language, for

127
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.198
example if you have a localized
application in different languages,

128
00:08:59.198 --> 00:09:03.371
you can actually see how it looks like
in Portuguese, in Polish, in Russian.

129
00:09:03.371 --> 00:09:10.580
And you can see that directly
in the premium, okay?

130
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:16.049
And also you can duplicate the whole
structure and have more previous

131
00:09:16.049 --> 00:09:21.524
even more people with different names and
you could change the name.

132
00:09:21.524 --> 00:09:25.163
And now I have like sections,

133
00:09:25.163 --> 00:09:29.540
every preview has a section title.

134
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.823
And technically I don't even
need to preview the same offer,

135
00:09:34.823 --> 00:09:36.864
I can preview any view.

136
00:09:36.864 --> 00:09:42.269
So you can actually pick the ones
that you wanna preview in this file.

137
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:44.771
Do you have any question?

138
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.984
&gt;&gt; How are the strux that we're defining

139
00:09:51.984 --> 00:09:56.967
in offer imported to content view
&gt;&gt; Let me see.

140
00:09:56.967 --> 00:09:58.440
They are not.

141
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.914
In fact right now if I run
the app in the real simulator,

142
00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:06.622
well let me first remove
the second preview.

143
00:10:06.622 --> 00:10:12.717
I'm not going to see
my offer because yeah,

144
00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:16.352
we can preview the offer.

145
00:10:16.352 --> 00:10:18.072
But yeah, you're right.

146
00:10:18.072 --> 00:10:20.030
I'm not seeing that here.

147
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.730
But if I change that, I can add an offer.

148
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.174
And I can add a title and a description.

149
00:10:27.174 --> 00:10:31.800
Okay, let's say offer 1, description 1.

150
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:38.299
So now if I received a preview of
the whole app, I see the offer inside.

151
00:10:40.545 --> 00:10:43.003
And do I need to import offer?

152
00:10:43.003 --> 00:10:44.698
Nope.

153
00:10:44.698 --> 00:10:46.405
No everything is public.

154
00:10:46.405 --> 00:10:50.663
So it's an another file
in the same project,

155
00:10:50.663 --> 00:10:55.928
you can just use it which means
you also need very careful

156
00:10:55.928 --> 00:11:00.648
with naming because you
may have name collision.

157
00:11:00.648 --> 00:11:02.552
Okay so be careful with that.

158
00:11:02.552 --> 00:11:03.681
Any question?

159
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.816
&gt;&gt; I like the multiple previews.

160
00:11:07.816 --> 00:11:08.674
&gt;&gt; You like multiple previews.

161
00:11:08.674 --> 00:11:10.098
&gt;&gt; It is pretty awesome.

162
00:11:10.098 --> 00:11:11.747
&gt;&gt; Yep, I think it is.

163
00:11:11.747 --> 00:11:16.097
If we go back to the content
view that is like our main,

164
00:11:16.097 --> 00:11:19.295
I can also duplicate here the preview.

165
00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:20.742
I have interactive mode,

166
00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:24.310
I need to stop the interactive
mode to actually duplicate this.

167
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.160
So I have now two content views.

168
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.736
And I can select here that
I wanna change the phone.

169
00:11:29.736 --> 00:11:33.777
So I wanna see for example how it
looks like on iPhone SE that has

170
00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:37.060
a smaller screen and
it doesn't contain a notch.

171
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.715
So now it's the first time it takes
some time when you change your device

172
00:11:41.715 --> 00:11:45.064
because it's opening
a simulator on that device.

173
00:11:45.064 --> 00:11:49.985
Okay so now it will run to
simulators under the and

174
00:11:49.985 --> 00:11:55.146
now you see the same app in
two different phones just

175
00:11:55.146 --> 00:12:00.924
by creating this group of
content views with a modifier.

176
00:12:00.924 --> 00:12:05.453
So previews are also written
in Swift structures, but

177
00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:10.184
important they are implementing
a different protocol.

178
00:12:10.184 --> 00:12:13.600
They are not conforming to view but
to preview provider.

179
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:19.120
And that means they are not
going to ship with your code.

180
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.459
So they're not going to be
compiled with your code.

181
00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:26.845
It's only for the development version.

182
00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:32.209
Well, now we need to play a little bit
with the offer, adding some modifiers.

183
00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:34.461
For example we can add a padding.

184
00:12:34.461 --> 00:12:39.420
When you say dot padding you're
applying padding a default padding

185
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.421
that is defined by the OS but

186
00:12:41.421 --> 00:12:46.568
also as I mentioned before you can
express your own padding in points.

187
00:12:46.568 --> 00:12:51.524
And also you can express only the top
padding and what if you want top and

188
00:12:51.524 --> 00:12:56.312
bottom, well you can apply another
padding, another modifier for

189
00:12:56.312 --> 00:12:58.596
bottom with a different value.

190
00:12:58.596 --> 00:13:04.478
Remember you can apply the same modifier
more than once with different values or

191
00:13:04.478 --> 00:13:08.879
even with with the same value,
it doesn't make any sense.

192
00:13:08.879 --> 00:13:12.414
But if you want double,
double default padding,

193
00:13:12.414 --> 00:13:17.477
you just apply double padding top and
you have double default padding.

194
00:13:17.477 --> 00:13:19.209
It works, okay?

195
00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:26.491
By the way it's top bottom and
not frightened left.

196
00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:29.360
It's leading and trailing.

197
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:35.905
You know why,
not right on left leading and trailing.

198
00:13:35.905 --> 00:13:38.757
This is for better localization.

199
00:13:38.757 --> 00:13:45.173
In languages that are right to left,
the Hebrew or Arabic.

200
00:13:45.173 --> 00:13:48.098
Then leaving is the opposite place.

201
00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:52.310
So you will use leading and
trailing here, not right and left.

202
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.302
Okay, so
I'm going to apply just the default value.

203
00:13:54.302 --> 00:13:57.972
I think it's fine on both text.

204
00:13:57.972 --> 00:14:02.680
So then font, changing the font size.

205
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.648
We have a couple of fonts
available if you just hit dot,

206
00:14:06.648 --> 00:14:09.420
body, title, caption, footnote.

207
00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:12.670
We have a couple of H1,
H2, something like that.

208
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:19.019
The font size that if you can use them,
it's better.

209
00:14:19.019 --> 00:14:19.848
Why?

210
00:14:19.848 --> 00:14:26.434
Because this will also honor what is
defined by the user inaccessibility.

211
00:14:26.434 --> 00:14:31.310
There were some users are increasing
the font size by default,

212
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.070
so this will honor users decision.

213
00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.462
If you use a fixed number,
it will be a fixed number.

214
00:14:38.462 --> 00:14:44.885
So you're not honoring this and
by the way you can create another copy and

215
00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:48.781
this one you can also
change dynamic type and

216
00:14:48.781 --> 00:14:53.426
you say that the user wants large font or
large font.

217
00:14:53.426 --> 00:14:58.666
So you will see that this
one is a little bit larger.

218
00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:01.387
I'm not sure if you can actually see that.

219
00:15:01.387 --> 00:15:09.212
If not, we can actually make it
even larger, extra, extra large.

220
00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:12.240
So you can see everything is bigger.

221
00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:16.800
But if you're just finding a font size,
that's like a specific number,

222
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.210
it's not gonna work.

223
00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.945
You will see the same thing.

224
00:15:20.945 --> 00:15:26.340
Okay, so
maybe I'm not going to focus right now on,

225
00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.785
we will see how to do that anyway.

226
00:15:29.785 --> 00:15:35.690
But I don't wanna start focusing
right now on dark mode.

227
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.088
So I'm going to delete the other
two previews, that was just for

228
00:15:40.088 --> 00:15:42.618
you to understand what's going on.

229
00:15:42.618 --> 00:15:45.960
And before moving on,
I'm going to connect these to GitHub.

230
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:53.546
So I'm going to here repositories and
go into you don't need to do this.

231
00:15:53.546 --> 00:15:57.020
This is because I'm going to
publish this to my GitHub account.

232
00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.761
I'm going to create a new remote.

233
00:15:59.761 --> 00:16:04.453
No, existing remote, no,
I wanna create a new remote

234
00:16:04.453 --> 00:16:09.352
on my GitHub account that I
have already set up under xCO.

235
00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:15.493
And let me see the name that I use for
the repository so you will get it.

236
00:16:15.493 --> 00:16:20.350
This one coffee masters
dash iOS going to use

237
00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.476
that repository name public so
you can get it.

238
00:16:25.476 --> 00:16:30.094
And now from source control I can commit.

239
00:16:30.094 --> 00:16:36.028
So this is our first commit.

240
00:16:36.028 --> 00:16:40.510
Like so when else I can push
to remote at the same time.

241
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:45.108
It's a push and it's commit and push.

242
00:16:45.108 --> 00:16:51.470
So now that repository will have some
content and I will be pushing data there.

243
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.632
So let's see if it works.

244
00:16:54.632 --> 00:17:01.760
Yep, so you have my code
there in case you need it.
