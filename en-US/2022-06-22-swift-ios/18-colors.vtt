1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.733
We need to still, we're not so
far from what we want, but

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:08.842
if you look here,
what we were trying to achieve.

3
00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:13.272
We have some colors and
we have some images there,

4
00:00:13.272 --> 00:00:17.071
okay, so let's see how to work with that.

5
00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:20.608
We saw that we can
actually change the color,

6
00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:24.437
like the background, and
we can find the color.

7
00:00:24.437 --> 00:00:28.895
But hard coding the color here,
it feels weird,

8
00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.808
Parco these bath, okay, we know that, so

9
00:00:32.808 --> 00:00:37.063
fortunately for us,
we don't have CSS here.

10
00:00:37.063 --> 00:00:42.939
We cannot create a Global CSS variables or
something that, we could create

11
00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:49.080
an Instructure with our color palette
if we want to, but we do have assets.

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.364
So going back to my brush navigator,
I have assets,

13
00:00:54.364 --> 00:01:00.380
okay, it looks like a file,
but it's not actually a file.

14
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.553
It's a folder with a structure but
we have a nice editor here,

15
00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:09.790
the first time you see that, it looks
a little scary, so we will get there.

16
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.784
So at the bottom, there is a plus sign,

17
00:01:13.784 --> 00:01:19.472
a very little plus sign,
okay, if you click that icon,

18
00:01:19.472 --> 00:01:23.242
we can create a new color set, okay?

19
00:01:23.242 --> 00:01:28.202
So we can create a new color set and
here, we can set a name,

20
00:01:28.202 --> 00:01:31.249
so we can create the primary color.

21
00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:39.415
So for every color, this is like creating
a CSS variable with a color, okay?

22
00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:44.005
For every color by default,
we can set dark light, so

23
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:51.149
if we use that color which actual color we
want to use when it's dark and winds like.

24
00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.908
If you open now and
now we will use this window,

25
00:01:56.908 --> 00:02:03.862
that one, we can click on primary,
okay, like there.

26
00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:07.690
And I can actually say
that in appearances,

27
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.830
that we don't want to
create the dark version,

28
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.674
it's not mandatory to have a dark version.

29
00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:22.677
So in that case, we have only one color,
here we can select the color that we want,

30
00:02:22.677 --> 00:02:29.089
but if you're coming from the web,
you probably want to use this version.

31
00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:33.991
Okay, so in the input method,
you can actually type the color, and

32
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:38.206
I already have the colors that
we're going to use for you.

33
00:02:38.206 --> 00:02:41.375
So in the companion website,

34
00:02:41.375 --> 00:02:46.192
in the chapter setting app colors is 3.2,

35
00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:51.538
you have the colors that we're gonna use,
okay?

36
00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:56.109
So I'm gonna just copy and
paste this and then push this,

37
00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.549
okay, so this is the primary color I have.

38
00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.973
&gt;&gt; How did you open?

39
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:07.457
&gt;&gt; This one, the inspector,
the attribute inspector?

40
00:03:07.457 --> 00:03:08.429
&gt;&gt; We found it, yep.

41
00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:14.063
&gt;&gt; So secondary,
it takes some time to get used to this,

42
00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:17.330
yeah, it's a new interface.

43
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.251
So secondary, these are all
the colors that we're going to use,

44
00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:26.480
so now every time we need the color,

45
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.540
we can reference to this
color library by name, okay?

46
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.116
That's kind of the idea, so

47
00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:42.217
we have primary, we have secondary,

48
00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:47.565
we have ternary, takes a while.

49
00:03:47.565 --> 00:03:54.268
I already have that done, but I prefer
that you see me doing that many times.

50
00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:57.546
So in case you are losing one step,

51
00:03:57.546 --> 00:04:02.869
you can see that again,
one more time alternative one.

52
00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:13.123
An alternative to alternative one,
alternative two.

53
00:04:21.742 --> 00:04:27.235
We are kind of there, okay,
and I have two backgrounds,

54
00:04:27.235 --> 00:04:31.360
car background and star face background.

55
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.924
So from now on, every color that we're
going to use is going to point to this

56
00:04:35.924 --> 00:04:39.530
place, this is like a global CSS,
if you want.

57
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:44.160
So this was card background, be careful

58
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.070
with names because it's case sensitive.

59
00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:57.172
So typically,
when you receive from your designer,

60
00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.207
in case you are not the designer.

61
00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:05.705
The color formation, you do this when
you're starting your project and

62
00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:09.770
SurfaceBackground, that was a simple one.

63
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.957
Surface background,
okay, now if you want to

64
00:05:14.957 --> 00:05:21.070
get my file directly,
I will push this quickly.

65
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.130
So you don't need to type every color, so

66
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.545
now that I do have colors,
how can I use them?

67
00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:32.933
Well, I'm going to use them for

68
00:05:32.933 --> 00:05:37.711
the background color, I want, in my offer.

69
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:41.791
And by the way, down probably,
I don't think I need or

70
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:44.560
I want the inspector panel anymore.

71
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.247
So I'm going to remove that
to get some more space,

72
00:05:49.247 --> 00:05:53.063
I'm going to apply the background here,

73
00:05:53.063 --> 00:05:57.219
how can I use the colors
that I have shaft set?

74
00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.349
From the library,
remember the library is the plus sign,

75
00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:08.016
from the library, there is a section for
colors, the last one.

76
00:06:08.016 --> 00:06:15.069
So if I go there, I will see my color,
so you go to the library and

77
00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:20.010
you open the last tab and
I can drag and drop.

78
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.302
So in this case,
I'm going to use card background, so

79
00:06:24.302 --> 00:06:27.220
I will put that within the background.

80
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:32.273
And it's just using the color constructor,
it wasn't a big deal, so now

81
00:06:32.273 --> 00:06:37.503
I can just copy and paste this modifier
here, so I need to resume my preview.

82
00:06:37.503 --> 00:06:42.066
And now you can see that background
color is being used on both, and

83
00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:47.540
because I'm applying the background
after the padding, it work as expected.

84
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.786
Remember that if I do
the background before the padding,

85
00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:55.470
it's a different situation, okay?

86
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.037
Now we need a background image,
we're going to work with images for

87
00:06:59.037 --> 00:06:59.921
the first time.

88
00:06:59.921 --> 00:07:05.363
But for doing that, can you see this,
can you spot these blue lines there?

89
00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:06.323
What's that?

90
00:07:06.323 --> 00:07:08.199
Those blue vertical lines?

91
00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:13.549
This is how you see changes
from the last commit, and

92
00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:19.151
you can click here and
discard the last change, okay?

93
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:23.941
So every change that you make,
okay, like this,

94
00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:26.805
you can discard that change.

95
00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:32.262
And also, probably you don't have this,
is how you can collapse,

96
00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:36.208
so look at that animation,
you need to do, wow.

97
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:40.164
So you don't have that because by default,
in Xcode,

98
00:07:40.164 --> 00:07:45.328
that's disabled, if you wanna
collapse different parts of the code.

99
00:07:45.328 --> 00:07:48.536
If you want to enable that,

100
00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:53.001
you need to go to Xcode preferences and

101
00:07:53.001 --> 00:08:00.690
here you have under Text Editing
the option code folding ribbon.

102
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.915
In case you want that way to fold code,

103
00:08:05.915 --> 00:08:11.670
you need to enable that line,
it's disabled by default, okay?
