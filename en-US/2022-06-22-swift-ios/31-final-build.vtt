1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.590
Okay, so now our app is ready.

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.760
Let's say we wanna this to the App Store,
how to make the final bill?

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.070
Well, in the Product menu, we actually
have a section that says Archive.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.200
But as you can see Archive,
it's grayed out by default.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.097
That's because we need
to change the target.

6
00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:27.400
Instead of selecting an emulator,
you need to select an iPhone.

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.928
But even if you don't have an iPhone,

8
00:00:29.928 --> 00:00:33.879
you can just select any iOS
device that will make the trick.

9
00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.793
Then you go to Product &gt; Archive.

10
00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:40.830
Archive will make the final bill and
the final archive.

11
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.337
The archive is the IPA,
the iPhone application.

12
00:00:44.337 --> 00:00:45.709
This will take a couple of seconds.

13
00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:52.950
It will also give me an error in case I
don't have my development account set up.

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.940
How to set up this, the team.

15
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.222
Remember when we were creating the app,
we had to select a team, and

16
00:00:59.222 --> 00:01:00.213
we didn't do that.

17
00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:06.648
Well, if you click in the project,
if we go back to General,

18
00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:10.700
not Info, General, we scroll down.

19
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.770
There are many places here
to change properties.

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.422
And also we have Signing &amp; Capabilities.

21
00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:21.884
In Signing &amp; Capabilities,
we can select a Team.

22
00:01:21.884 --> 00:01:24.950
And I have my personal account.

23
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.071
Probably you won't have one,
the first time you set up Xcode.

24
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:35.948
For either your Apple account,
you need to go to Preferences &gt; Accounts.

25
00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:40.230
And in Accounts,
you're going to add your Apple ID.

26
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.560
So after you add that,
your name will appear here.

27
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.390
So now, it will try to register this.

28
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.728
It gave me an error, which means
that someone in the audience or

29
00:01:54.728 --> 00:01:59.376
here has already registered
that bundle identifier.

30
00:01:59.376 --> 00:02:06.455
If you look at the error message, it says
that, that identifier is not available.

31
00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:11.686
Remember I mentioned that
when you make the final bill,

32
00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:15.680
the ID is going to be registered there.

33
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.290
So I'm just going to add here .firt.

34
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.990
That's my username and try again.

35
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.900
And now, I hope no one there
is actually using that one.

36
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040
And now it's ready.

37
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.625
So now, Product &gt; Archive.

38
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:36.230
And the IPA will be ready
to submit to the App Store.

39
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.750
Bill succeeded, here we have the Archive.

40
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.983
And from here,
we can just click Distribute App and

41
00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:46.042
it will upload this to the App Store.

42
00:02:46.042 --> 00:02:48.918
For that you need to pay.

43
00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:52.059
So here is the part where you need
to have an Apple developer account.

44
00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:56.528
So your Apple ID should be connected to
a paid account to actually submit this to

45
00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:57.419
the App Store.

46
00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:58.484
The question is,

47
00:02:58.484 --> 00:03:03.029
how can we run the app in our local
devices if you have your iPhone connected?

48
00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.152
First, you actually need a team.

49
00:03:05.152 --> 00:03:09.234
So if you have already set the team for
the final version,

50
00:03:09.234 --> 00:03:12.905
now you can select your
iPhone from the iOS device.

51
00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:16.134
It will appear here and you just hit Run.

52
00:03:16.134 --> 00:03:20.098
That will install the app on your
real device connected through USB.

53
00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:23.368
You need to unlock the device first,
if not it's not gonna work.

54
00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:25.645
So I'm using face ID now.

55
00:03:25.645 --> 00:03:27.505
And the app will appear on your phone.

56
00:03:27.505 --> 00:03:29.488
So you will install the app and

57
00:03:29.488 --> 00:03:34.475
the app will keep in your phone
even if you unplug the USB cable.

58
00:03:34.475 --> 00:03:36.421
The app will not last there forever.

59
00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:41.748
It will work for a couple of months only.

60
00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:45.079
After that it's not gonna work
because it's a development app.

61
00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.750
But actually I have the app up and
running in my iPhone right now.

62
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.620
So it's actually pretty simple.

63
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.503
And you can debug, and you can do
anything like if it's simulator,

64
00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:57.740
it's just the same.

65
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.672
The only requirement is
to have an Apple ID and

66
00:04:00.672 --> 00:04:04.235
set up the team in the project settings,
that's all.

67
00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:07.679
It can be an iPad, an iPhone, or
it can be an Apple TV, or a watch,

68
00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:10.270
in case you're doing apps for
those platforms.
