WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:03.259
So we wanna work with images, okay?

2
00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:05.415
So, where are images go?

3
00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:10.596
In the same assets folder,
in the same assets manager.

4
00:00:10.596 --> 00:00:15.824
So instead of creating a new color set,

5
00:00:15.824 --> 00:00:20.122
we can create a new image set.

6
00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:23.088
In fact, we do have here an app
icon that is kind of empty.

7
00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:27.221
It looks weird, but
we will see that at the end.

8
00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:33.997
So if we came here, and we select
new image set, we can set a name,

9
00:00:33.997 --> 00:00:39.312
such as, we can call this a car,
where is my image?

10
00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:44.509
It's here, BackgroundPattern.

11
00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:49.328
Look at this, 1x, 2x, 3x.

12
00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:52.814
Do you recognize these from somewhere?

13
00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:56.670
What is 1x, 2x, 3x, what's that?

14
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.799
Because we have different resolutions,
it's saying, okay,

15
00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.626
if you're going to give me a bitmap,
I need three bitmaps.

16
00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:08.432
On Android, it's even worse,
because you're can have four.

17
00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:13.367
On iPhone,
we have only devices with two and three,

18
00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.292
but iPads, they may have one.

19
00:01:16.292 --> 00:01:22.500
So you need to provide different PNG files
for that particular background pattern.

20
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.931
If you downloaded the assets
from the companion website,

21
00:01:29.931 --> 00:01:34.487
you do have that background image.

22
00:01:34.487 --> 00:01:38.260
And you have the background PNG 2x and 3x.

23
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.458
So if you want, you can drag them like so.

24
00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:50.093
That is just the same file
in different dimension.

25
00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:52.917
But also, there is a PDF file.

26
00:01:52.917 --> 00:01:57.057
iOS is supporting SVG and PDF today.

27
00:01:57.057 --> 00:02:00.602
So instead of providing three versions,

28
00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:05.768
if it's not a picture photo,
and if it's a vector-based,

29
00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:11.136
you can create the PDF version
from Illustrator, or Adobe XD,

30
00:02:11.136 --> 00:02:17.337
or sketch, or designer tools, UX tools,
and you can get a PDF or an SVG.

31
00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:21.672
If you wanna use that version,
the PDF version,

32
00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:25.498
we need to change in
this asset a property.

33
00:02:25.498 --> 00:02:32.556
So I will open the attributes
inspector over the background pattern,

34
00:02:32.556 --> 00:02:36.503
and there are a lot of options here, but

35
00:02:36.503 --> 00:02:40.343
I'm interested right now in scales.

36
00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:44.717
And instead of saying that I
will provide individual scales,

37
00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:46.911
I will provide a single scale.

38
00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.503
And now I need to delete this tube engine.

39
00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.508
And what's the deal here?

40
00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:54.286
I can now drag the PDF version.

41
00:02:55.447 --> 00:02:58.179
Just that.

42
00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:01.643
Also, just because I'm here,
we have also a logo

43
00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:06.349
that we're going to use later in PDF,
SVG, or three PNG versions.

44
00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:13.607
You can also take the SVG, for example,
and drag it not here but here, okay?

45
00:03:13.607 --> 00:03:18.750
Not here, here in the list,
and is creating that logo.

46
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.309
Unfortunately, it's creating
always with three versions.

47
00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:27.621
So if you know it's an SVG,
you need to say no,

48
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:31.171
no, this is for single scale, okay?

49
00:03:31.171 --> 00:03:33.783
So, that's the logo.

50
00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:37.332
So that's how you set up assets, okay?

51
00:03:37.332 --> 00:03:39.454
You need three PNG per asset.

52
00:03:39.454 --> 00:03:43.967
If you don't provide three PNG, what will
happen is that your PNG will be pixelated,

53
00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:48.352
or it won't have the right resolution, or
you're going to use more memory on older

54
00:03:48.352 --> 00:03:51.323
devices or cheaper devices,
you don't wanna do that.

55
00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:54.573
So it's better to have PNG,
SVG, or three versions.

56
00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:57.939
Do you have any questions
on how to load assets?

57
00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:05.148
They will go into our iPhone application,
so they will be sent with that.

58
00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:10.279
Okay, so now in my offer, you will
see how that, in a couple of minutes,

59
00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:14.168
our app will start looking like an app,
I promise you.

60
00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:20.049
So, what I need is to provide some
kind of image for this, okay?

61
00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.623
So by the way, there is an image view.

62
00:04:25.623 --> 00:04:29.917
And if we use the library again,
what's the library?

63
00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:33.901
The plus sign, there is also an, sorry,

64
00:04:33.901 --> 00:04:38.013
do that again,
there is also a media picker.

65
00:04:38.013 --> 00:04:42.306
And now, I can see my logo
on my background pattern.

66
00:04:42.306 --> 00:04:46.470
And if I drag it, I know, somewhere,

67
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.903
right there, it's giving me an image.

68
00:04:50.903 --> 00:04:56.024
But the problem is that, yeah,
the image is appearing in the VStack.

69
00:04:56.024 --> 00:04:59.054
And so it appears the image and
then two text.

70
00:04:59.054 --> 00:05:01.604
And the image is too large, so

71
00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:07.536
the texts are actually outside of
my preview, so I don't like this.

72
00:05:07.536 --> 00:05:13.094
So I want the image behind the text, okay?

73
00:05:13.094 --> 00:05:16.298
To do that, what I need is a ZStack.

74
00:05:16.298 --> 00:05:22.140
The ZStack will actually let me put
layers one on top of the other.

75
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.369
So look at this,
I'm going to create the ZStack.

76
00:05:26.369 --> 00:05:31.284
And then inside the ZStack,
I'm going to put the image and

77
00:05:31.284 --> 00:05:34.201
the VStack as siblings, like so.

78
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:39.157
You have the final code in the companion
website, if you wanna copy and

79
00:05:39.157 --> 00:05:40.255
paste anyway.

80
00:05:40.255 --> 00:05:44.673
And now,
it kind of look better as I was expecting.

81
00:05:47.698 --> 00:05:50.800
Any question?

82
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.744
Right, it is still not ready but, no?

83
00:05:56.744 --> 00:06:01.449
&gt;&gt; Just wondering if in CSS,
you defined ZStack with a number so

84
00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:03.300
that's always on top?

85
00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.837
&gt;&gt; Z index.

86
00:06:04.837 --> 00:06:06.207
&gt;&gt; Z index, yeah-
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but

87
00:06:06.207 --> 00:06:10.722
it is more like position absolute,
position fixed in CSS.

88
00:06:10.722 --> 00:06:16.744
If you have two elements,
position absolute over the same position,

89
00:06:16.744 --> 00:06:18.998
well, it's a ZStack,.

90
00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:28.278
Okay, so,
the next step is to create another view.

91
00:06:28.278 --> 00:06:33.107
And now, you will see that we
are going to be increasing the speed

92
00:06:33.107 --> 00:06:35.086
now that we know the deal.

93
00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:40.875
But we want to create a new
file that is called OffersPage.

94
00:06:40.875 --> 00:06:44.637
By the way, I'm creating a SwiftUI view,

95
00:06:46.495 --> 00:06:49.447
It's the OffersPage, okay?

96
00:06:49.447 --> 00:06:55.989
And the OffersPage,
we have offers inside, that's the idea.

97
00:06:55.989 --> 00:07:01.591
So, if you follow here the website,
the companion website,

98
00:07:01.591 --> 00:07:07.409
I think it's here in user interface basic,
we'll just copy and

99
00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:12.926
paste this first and
then when we explain what it looks like.

100
00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:19.360
Because I have some text there that
I don't wanna type, so it's easy.

101
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:26.696
Let's remove the list for
a minute because we all know what that is.

102
00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:27.702
I have two offers.

103
00:07:27.702 --> 00:07:30.553
So I will create a VStack of two offers.

104
00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:33.614
In fact, we can even keep the VStack.

105
00:07:33.614 --> 00:07:36.168
You know the VStack, right?

106
00:07:36.168 --> 00:07:40.834
It's just pulled in elements
vertically with two offers,

107
00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:43.364
with a title and a description.

108
00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:46.902
Let's see how it looks like, like this.

109
00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:53.469
I mean, it's not so bad but
they are too large, right?

110
00:07:53.469 --> 00:07:58.918
And they're not looking like this, why?

111
00:08:00.355 --> 00:08:08.018
My preview here was actually
fixed in height, the preview.

112
00:08:08.018 --> 00:08:11.629
The problem is that when we
are putting these views in a VStack,

113
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:15.050
they don't have that constraint,
that high constraint.

114
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.941
So they're just using all
the possible space they can.

115
00:08:19.941 --> 00:08:23.290
So, we actually need to go to our offer.

116
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.856
So, it's actually the image,
the one that is taking a large space.

117
00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:34.073
Do you see the little blue line?

118
00:08:34.073 --> 00:08:36.293
It's actually the real size of that.

119
00:08:36.293 --> 00:08:38.113
Can we change that?

120
00:08:38.113 --> 00:08:43.400
Yes, to change the size of an element,
it's called frame.

121
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.069
So we're going to use the frame modifier.

122
00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:52.024
And the frame modifier accepts a lot
of properties, all of them optional.

123
00:08:52.024 --> 00:08:55.754
So actually, that means that we
can set the one that we want,

124
00:08:55.754 --> 00:08:59.922
like the height in any value,
like 300, or 200, or 250,

125
00:08:59.922 --> 00:09:03.378
I don't know,
you play with this until you're happy.

126
00:09:04.599 --> 00:09:07.412
So now we are narrowing this.

127
00:09:07.412 --> 00:09:10.192
And what about the width?

128
00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:16.890
If I want the width like 100% in CSS,
100%, we don't have presentation.

129
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.339
The only unit is points.

130
00:09:20.339 --> 00:09:22.437
Can we get the screen size somehow?

131
00:09:22.437 --> 00:09:25.368
Yes, we can, but there is a better way.

132
00:09:25.368 --> 00:09:31.364
Something that we can express, it's
setting not the width but the max width.

133
00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:33.531
There is another property and

134
00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:38.904
there is a special value called .infinity,
which says something like,

135
00:09:38.904 --> 00:09:43.863
okay, try to use as much as possible,
okay, something like that.

136
00:09:43.863 --> 00:09:50.147
But now, when I'm setting this, I'm giving
an error saying, no, it doesn't work like

137
00:09:50.147 --> 00:09:55.787
this because there are two versions of
the frame function, the frame modifier.

138
00:09:55.787 --> 00:10:00.000
One, to set the fixed height and
the fixed width, and

139
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.216
the other one doesn't
contain the height property,

140
00:10:04.216 --> 00:10:08.257
they contain other properties
such as max height.

141
00:10:08.257 --> 00:10:10.283
I don't know why they
did this in this way.

142
00:10:10.283 --> 00:10:15.617
So instead of height,
we define max, the mean and max.

143
00:10:15.617 --> 00:10:17.426
So max height, max width.

144
00:10:17.426 --> 00:10:21.400
And now,
it's complaining because of the order.

145
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.878
Remember I mentioned that you can
omit arguments if they're optional,

146
00:10:26.878 --> 00:10:29.570
but you cannot change the order, so

147
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:34.617
the width go first because that's
how they create the signature.

148
00:10:34.617 --> 00:10:39.549
Okay, so now if our resume here,
looks like this,

149
00:10:39.549 --> 00:10:42.760
and if I go to OffersPage, okay,

150
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.465
it looks weird because
what's going on is that,

151
00:10:47.465 --> 00:10:51.520
yeah, it seems like it's working fine.

152
00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.951
In fact, let's go to the offer, and
let's change this layout to 400.

153
00:10:56.951 --> 00:10:59.761
So we can see that the offer,

154
00:10:59.761 --> 00:11:05.045
it's actually getting out
of the maximum that I set.

155
00:11:05.045 --> 00:11:09.836
That is because by default,
the same happens in CSS.

156
00:11:09.836 --> 00:11:16.207
I mean, if I search for CSS joke,
I probably gonna find it.

157
00:11:16.207 --> 00:11:21.645
I didn't plan on this, this one,
[LAUGH] I was looking for that one.

158
00:11:21.645 --> 00:11:23.985
This is what's happening right now.

159
00:11:23.985 --> 00:11:28.218
Yeah, I set the constraints, but
anyway, the image is bigger, so

160
00:11:28.218 --> 00:11:31.279
it's actually getting
out of its constraints.

161
00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.932
The same happens in CSS.

162
00:11:32.932 --> 00:11:39.160
So something that I can do is apply
another modifiers called clipped.

163
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:42.577
Just the way we'd actually
clip the element.

164
00:11:42.577 --> 00:11:49.264
So now, it's not getting out of its
frame even if the image is larger.

165
00:11:49.264 --> 00:11:55.004
And finally, we have what we wanted.

166
00:11:55.004 --> 00:11:58.103
And by the way, this is OffersPage.

167
00:11:58.103 --> 00:12:05.373
My ContentView still has some demo offer,
I can now say, OffersPage.

168
00:12:05.373 --> 00:12:08.051
And now, my app has the offers.

169
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:13.109
But it doesn't look like an app yet,
okay, it's just two offers.

170
00:12:13.109 --> 00:12:16.106
This is what we are trying to achieve,
okay?

171
00:12:16.106 --> 00:12:18.715
We have this page, but look at the title.

172
00:12:18.715 --> 00:12:22.690
There is a title saying Offers there,
that if I scroll,

173
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.155
it becomes something nice there.

174
00:12:25.155 --> 00:12:31.661
That effect comes automatically
if we apply another container.

175
00:12:31.661 --> 00:12:34.372
So in my OffersPage,

176
00:12:34.372 --> 00:12:40.253
I'm going to apply
a container to the VStack.

177
00:12:40.253 --> 00:12:43.447
It's called the NavigationView.

178
00:12:43.447 --> 00:12:48.149
So I will put the VStack inside.

179
00:12:48.149 --> 00:12:50.548
And now, how to set the title?

180
00:12:50.548 --> 00:12:55.200
It's a modifier of,
in this case, the VStack or

181
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.494
the child of the NavigationView.

182
00:12:58.494 --> 00:13:04.277
It's called the modifier,
remember a modifier is a function,

183
00:13:04.277 --> 00:13:07.605
navigationTitle, just like that.

184
00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:13.472
In fact, if I have more offers,
NavigationView, like so,

185
00:13:14.647 --> 00:13:20.067
We have a problem with scroll
because VStack has no scroll.

186
00:13:20.067 --> 00:13:25.729
But if I change VStack with List,
it works.

187
00:13:25.729 --> 00:13:33.489
So at least, it's a VStack with
some behaviors such as a scroll and

188
00:13:33.489 --> 00:13:38.909
in more interactivity
that we will see later.

189
00:13:38.909 --> 00:13:40.573
So look at the title.

190
00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:47.007
Now, when I'm scrolling,
offers is having that effect.

191
00:13:47.007 --> 00:13:52.269
The only thing that I added is a List
to have a scroll and a NavigationView.

192
00:13:52.269 --> 00:13:55.653
We have a NavigationView as a container,
and

193
00:13:55.653 --> 00:13:59.398
then navigationTitle as
a modifier of the child.

194
00:14:00.679 --> 00:14:05.849
So you can see here how easy is to be

195
00:14:05.849 --> 00:14:13.053
similar to other iOS apps
in just a few clicks or

196
00:14:13.053 --> 00:14:17.690
just having one or two views.
