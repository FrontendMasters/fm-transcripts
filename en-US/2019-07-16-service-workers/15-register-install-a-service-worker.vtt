00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.298
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, so to begin adding
a service worker to our application, we're

2
00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:10.986
going to do something a little bit similar
to what we did with our web workers.

3
00:00:10.986 --> 00:00:14.400
But it's gonna be a little bit different
because now we have a bit more

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.960
setup work to do with a service worker.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.040
So the first thing I'm gonna
do is make a variable that

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.870
is gonna store my service worker instance,
similar to the one we did with web worker.

7
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.950
And then, I'm going to,

8
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.590
in this code,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I'm going

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.816
to call a function called
initServiceWorker.

10
00:00:40.816 --> 00:00:44.379
And it's gonna be an asynchronous
function, and I just want any errors that

11
00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.942
may happen, because we'll
definitely make errors, I'm sure.

12
00:00:47.942 --> 00:00:50.004
Just wanna make sure all
those get printed so

13
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:53.971
all the catch
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Clause there so

14
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:55.572
that we can see it.

15
00:00:55.572 --> 00:01:04.275
And then, we're gonna define a async
function called initServiceWorker.

16
00:01:13.956 --> 00:01:15.862
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And then,
additionally, up here,

17
00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:18.140
we want to have a couple
of other variables.

18
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.997
Again, like we did with the navigator,

19
00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:26.150
we should at least try to detect
are we using service workers here?

20
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.940
So we're gonna assume if service workers
are supported, then we are using them.

21
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.559
So we're gonna say if

22
00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:42.239
serviceWorker in navigator.

23
00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:45.052
If navigator.serviceWorker is present,

24
00:01:45.052 --> 00:01:48.610
then that means that
we're gonna be using it.

25
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.489
And then, we're gonna also want
a variable that stores what's called

26
00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:55.776
a service worker registration.

27
00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:57.819
So we will set up another variable there.

28
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.005
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Our
initServiceWorker function,

29
00:02:10.005 --> 00:02:13.779
the first thing that we wanna
do is assign that registration.

30
00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:17.710
This is what we get whenever we
first start up our service worker.

31
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.860
So this is a little different than a
regular worker where you get it right back

32
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.450
when you call new worker.

33
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.410
Here, you get back a registration,
and then

34
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.400
depending on what state the service worker
is in in it's life cycle at that point,

35
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.100
that's how you access the service worker.

36
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.334
So we'll get into all of that.

37
00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:37.175
But we're gonna say sw,
service worker registration equals await.

38
00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:44.109
And then we're gonna do
navigator.serviceWorker.

39
00:02:47.762 --> 00:02:50.923
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And then,
we're going to pass in an object.

40
00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:54.860
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's
actually the register method.

41
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.760
And then, the first parameter that
we're gonna pass, let me zoom out so

42
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.300
you can see it.

43
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.565
The first parameter we're
gonna pass is the URL

44
00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:10.762
to our service worker,
which is slas js slash sw dot js.

45
00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:11.347
And then,

46
00:03:11.347 --> 00:03:15.979
that second parameter is the object that
we're gonna pass with the configuration.

47
00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:22.130
The configuration that we want here
is updateViaCache equals false.

48
00:03:25.793 --> 00:03:29.056
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We'll talk more about
that update stuff in just a moment.

49
00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.950
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So now,
we have a registration.

50
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.880
This is what's gonna actually start up and
install, essentially,

51
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.610
it's gonna go access that service worker.

52
00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.077
A quick note on this part, if we load it
as /js/swjs which is where it's located.

53
00:03:49.077 --> 00:03:54.693
If we load as that, then the service
worker is only gonna handle requests for

54
00:03:54.693 --> 00:03:56.901
files underneath that path.

55
00:03:56.901 --> 00:04:01.390
Now, we want the service worker to
handle it for our entire document root.

56
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.265
So we wanna load it like this,

57
00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:07.241
even though we probably wanna
locate it inside of the slash js.

58
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:13.218
So I've already taken care of on
the server doing a URL rewrite,

59
00:04:13.218 --> 00:04:18.765
that slash sw dot js actually
loads slash js slash sw dot js.

60
00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:21.562
So that's a little nuance
problem that you may run into.

61
00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:26.059
If you locate your service worker anywhere
other than the route, you probably wanna

62
00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:30.000
do like some sort of URL redirect set
up on your server to make that happen.
