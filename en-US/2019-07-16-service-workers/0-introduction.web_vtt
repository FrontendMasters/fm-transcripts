1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.025
So that's what we're gonna be focusing
on today is service workers and

2
00:00:03.025 --> 00:00:04.587
how we write them what they're for.

3
00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:09.082
How we write them, how we position
them within a website in particular.

4
00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:14.270
And I say website on purpose because
most of the other materials that are out

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.380
there that talk about service workers
seem to focus on progressive web apps.

6
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.710
I just wanna give a quick note
about progressive web apps.

7
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.425
That's how I actually first started
experiencing them was last summer I

8
00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:32.906
decided I wanted to build myself
a progressive web app to install on my

9
00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:33.790
phone.

10
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.912
It's a little app that lets you like take
notes when you're at a restaurant and

11
00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:39.630
then be reminded when you
come back to that restaurant.

12
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.940
And I wanted to build that out for myself
and I wanted to do it with web technology.

13
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.814
I don't wanna go learn Java or
whatever you use on iOS these days,

14
00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:49.300
I can't keep up with it.

15
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.750
But I didn't want to learn any of that.

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.040
I just wanted to use the good old
web technologies that I knew.

17
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.534
And so I did dive in for
the first time to service workers and

18
00:00:57.534 --> 00:00:59.960
try to figure out how they work.

19
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.043
And I was doing exactly what any of
you have done if you have tried,

20
00:01:04.043 --> 00:01:08.880
which is just randomly googling around
saying somebody tell me what this is.

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.180
I do wanna point out I've
got in the links here.

22
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.550
I found about halfway through that
journey that one of my favorite people on

23
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.140
the internet Jeremy Keith had
written a book called going offline.

24
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.120
This is an absolutely fantastic book.

25
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.900
So please go buy that book.

26
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.000
It's one of the best resources I found for
trying to sift through this stuff.

27
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.770
But there's still just lots and lots of
bits and pieces, incomplete information.

28
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.956
There's lots of reference on MDN.

29
00:01:34.956 --> 00:01:38.920
There's lots of write ups that
Google has done about it.

30
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.640
Trying to piece together all of these
things is a very manual process, and

31
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.920
literally the code that we'll be going
through today, was done exactly that way.

32
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.357
I set out with here's what I kind of
want to build and I know the pieces but

33
00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:53.931
I'm gonna have to fiddle with it and
I spent a lot of time fiddling with it.

34
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:57.700
And trying it and trying it over and
over and over again.

35
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.449
So I certainly,

36
00:01:58.449 --> 00:02:01.880
am not at the place where I can just
write this stuff perfectly from scratch.

37
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.450
I don't think that's
even reasonable to do.

38
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.693
A couple of things to point out there
are in here a couple of resources

39
00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:15.820
that you should know about,
in particular, this one on workbox.

40
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.090
That is a framework for
writing service workers.

41
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.080
So it's like a library framework thing
that you load into your service worker.

42
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.910
It has variety of API's for
declaratively setting stuff up.

43
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.990
I think it's a great idea to have
something like this because quite frankly,

44
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.650
many of you are probably gonna get
pretty intimidated pretty quick.

45
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.841
When you see just how much
code we're gonna be writting.

46
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:44.840
I'm actually excited by being able to
write my own code in a service worker.

47
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.570
So I went the opposite direction.

48
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.697
Instead of using a framework or library,

49
00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:51.630
I really wanted to have all
of that fine grained control.

50
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.090
And with that control comes
an understanding of things.

51
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.421
And I really wanted to understand
what was possible what I could do.

52
00:02:58.421 --> 00:03:01.473
And there's a lot of things that
are possible that don't even

53
00:03:01.473 --> 00:03:05.670
get talked about and will kind of cover
those various things as we go along.

54
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.272
But, I certainly understand that, if you
are trying to get something shipped at

55
00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:14.210
work, you don't have a lot of time,
to just, greenfield explore.

56
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.085
And, that would be a really great starting
point to get a service worker up and

57
00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:22.760
going, that'd be a really
great starting point for him.

58
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.709
So back to what I was saying a moment
ago about the idea of sites versus

59
00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.910
applications.

60
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.670
Everybody seems to think
about it in terms of apps.

61
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.340
That's where I started learning and
building was with apps.

62
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.140
But I'm gonna talk to you today about
using service workers with everything.

63
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.030
That's not a web application.

64
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.726
Because I think one of the things that
we have missed on the web, and by missed

65
00:03:50.726 --> 00:03:56.590
I mean, I think we didn't realize how
important this was a long long time ago.

66
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.968
If we'd realized a long long time
ago how important this problem is,

67
00:04:00.968 --> 00:04:06.320
I think we would have had something like
service workers a decade or two ago.

68
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.686
And I'm not even sure whether
the technology platform was mature enough

69
00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:10.480
for that.

70
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.250
But it would have been a problem that we
had been trying to solve a lot earlier.

71
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.300
And it feels relatively not that solved.

72
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:21.198
And so when you hear people talk about
service workers, they immediately think,

73
00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.990
well, I'm not building an app,
so I don't need that.

74
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.819
And the claim that I'm going to make and

75
00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.887
I'm hoping to enable at least from
a creative thinking perspective.

76
00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:36.987
All of you that are watching this
to do is I'm gonna make the claim

77
00:04:36.987 --> 00:04:43.139
that literally every single website on
the internet needs a service worker.

78
00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.535
Every single website, I mean,

79
00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:50.290
the static one pager that
somebody wrote 20 years ago.

80
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.020
And I mean the fancy gmails of the world
and I mean everything in between.

81
00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.800
I think they all need a service worker.

82
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:04.257
And I think that as we are moving into
this age of taking advantage of the web

83
00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:10.610
platform we get focused on the shiny
stuff like I got CSS Grid, or I got this.

84
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.988
And now I have these like
progressive retina images and

85
00:05:13.988 --> 00:05:16.270
I've got all these crazy web fonts.

86
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.365
And I've got SVG and I've got animations
we get focused and rightly so

87
00:05:20.365 --> 00:05:22.560
those are fun and exciting things.

88
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.352
We get focused on the shiny stuff,
but I think we forget some of the most

89
00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:31.310
important base plumbing
fundamentals of the web.

90
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.262
And I think the web got it wrong web and
by web, I mean broadly,

91
00:05:35.262 --> 00:05:39.650
the browser technology,
I think we got something wrong.

92
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.556
And service workers at least the way
that I've positioned them in my mind,

93
00:05:43.556 --> 00:05:45.530
they go to trying to fix that.

94
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.427
The thing that I'm talking about is
that we have always had some notion of

95
00:05:50.427 --> 00:05:53.960
information being cached in our browsers.

96
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.660
And we often think of well,
because I have it cached.

97
00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.830
It means I don't have to reload it
the next time I go to the website.

98
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.770
That's unfortunately not really the case.

99
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.258
If you were to dig into
the source code of a browser and

100
00:06:08.258 --> 00:06:13.052
look at all of the different
paths that it goes through,

101
00:06:13.052 --> 00:06:16.360
to decide when it sees a request.

102
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.476
Whether or not to try to load it from
cache to even look in the cache or

103
00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:22.630
load it from cache versus getting
it from a server or what it does.

104
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:26.170
You'd probably be blown away
at just how complex that is.

105
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.961
It's not a binary decision,
like it's in the cache, I use it or

106
00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:30.513
it's not in the cache, and I don't.

107
00:06:30.513 --> 00:06:33.290
And I think that's one of the problems
that we have is that we've so

108
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.200
simplistically cemented in our mind.

109
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.758
Something so uninteresting, is caching,

110
00:06:37.758 --> 00:06:41.960
that we just think,
the browser takes care of that for me.

111
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.290
In our interest this morning, many of you
talked about being all over the world and

112
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.760
all these different places I travel for
work.

113
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.060
I'm all over the place and
just a few days I'll be in Lithuania.

114
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.261
And then I'll be in other parts of Broad.

115
00:06:55.261 --> 00:06:59.989
And that means I spend most of
my time not on my home Wi-Fi or

116
00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:03.002
in my nice United States of America.

117
00:07:03.002 --> 00:07:09.170
High-speed Wi-Fi connection sort of stuff
I use T-Mobile is my mobile provider.

118
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.730
And that means that I get free
internet everywhere I go.

119
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.472
But it's at 2G speeds so
that's the downside of it.

120
00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:22.494
And I can pay like $50 a month to
upgrade it to 4G but I'm cheap like that

121
00:07:22.494 --> 00:07:28.060
I don't normally do that unless I'm
going to be somewhere for a long time.

122
00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.376
Few weeks in Australia yeah,
I'm gonna pay to upgrade but

123
00:07:31.376 --> 00:07:35.880
if it's a few days I just suffer
through the 2G experiences of the web.

124
00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.642
And so maybe more than most I get to see
firsthand what it's like when we build not

125
00:07:41.642 --> 00:07:47.340
only slow experiences but
basically broken experiences for people.

126
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.113
We get so myopically focused on
well my boss and my sales and

127
00:07:51.113 --> 00:07:56.510
marketing departments tell me that all of
our customers have high speed internet.

128
00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:00.974
And they access us at home on a desktop
computer with a high end monitor and

129
00:08:00.974 --> 00:08:05.365
stuff like that we get so focused on
that's where our customer is that we

130
00:08:05.365 --> 00:08:08.240
forget, the fact that
customers are mobile.

131
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.460
This is one of the things
I think that we've missed.

132
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.380
We forget the fact that I can be your
customer here in the United States

133
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.160
of America and I can load up your website.

134
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.500
And I can be thinking I want to buy
something from you or pay for a service.

135
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.899
And then in the middle of that decision
get on a plane and fly to Lithuania or

136
00:08:28.899 --> 00:08:33.500
some other bizarre,
far off exotic place, whatever.

137
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.120
And I get off the plane and I connect to
my 2g speeds and I'm still your customer

138
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.120
and I still wanna experience
the web exactly like I did before.

139
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.930
And guess what?

140
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.100
I'm willing to tolerate the idea.

141
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.140
I know that it's not gonna be
as perfect as it was back home.

142
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.029
But there's a difference between I'm
willing to tolerate a degraded experience

143
00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:56.700
and I'm willing to just
essentially assume I get nothing.

144
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.720
I literally get nothing
because nothing will love.

145
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.824
For example,

146
00:09:00.824 --> 00:09:06.620
many times I'll be sitting in an airport
board waiting to get on the plane.

147
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.680
I'll see a tweet that comes by with
a blog post and it looks interesting.

148
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:13.694
So I click on the blog post, I start
reading the first few paragraphs and

149
00:09:13.694 --> 00:09:15.330
then they board us on the plane.

150
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.550
So I go, put the phone in my pocket,
I get on the plane.

151
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:19.880
I'm in the middle of that blog post.

152
00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:20.580
I'm still reading it.

153
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.460
I wanna see what that
blog post has to say.

154
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.935
I go get on the plane,
we turn our phones into airplane mode.

155
00:09:26.935 --> 00:09:31.905
30,000 feet in the air,
there's no Wi Fi on this stupid plane,

156
00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:37.960
and I open up your blog page and I get
a blank white failed to loads screen.

157
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.821
Why is it that I had that content before I
took off and I didn't do anything because

158
00:09:42.821 --> 00:09:47.040
I got navigated around and
went to a whole different website.

159
00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.332
It's still an open tab in
my mobile browser, but

160
00:09:50.332 --> 00:09:53.320
I get on the plane and it's gone.

161
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.240
And there's actually 1000 different
reasons why that might have happened.

162
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.574
The website might have had dynamic
resources in the background that tried

163
00:10:00.574 --> 00:10:03.530
to make a request and
that might have been why it happened.

164
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.840
It's actually probably an ad that
messed it up, that did that to my site.

165
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.599
Whatever the reason is,
now I don't have your blog post and for

166
00:10:10.599 --> 00:10:14.350
the next three hours, I can't read
the thing that I wanted to read.

167
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.779
I think that's what we've missed about
the web is that we've made these

168
00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:27.010
terrible assumptions that people are gonna
experience the web in a contiguous way.

169
00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.382
That when you sit down to
experience something about the web,

170
00:10:29.382 --> 00:10:30.760
you're not gonna be interrupted.

171
00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.222
You're gonna have perfect Wi Fi
perfect internet connectivity,

172
00:10:34.222 --> 00:10:35.970
perfect battery power.

173
00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:38.890
You're never gonna have any
sort of interruption to that.

174
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.710
That's the way that we design the web.

175
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:45.830
And the reality is that that's not
the way the web is experienced,

176
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:48.554
by the vast majority of
the human population.

177
00:10:48.554 --> 00:10:51.635
It's a very,
vanishingly small amount of us that get

178
00:10:51.635 --> 00:10:56.710
to have the privilege of experiencing
this continuous perfect web all the time.

179
00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.789
And it's such a first world privilege
problem when we're like, my god,

180
00:11:00.789 --> 00:11:02.950
GitHub took four seconds to load.

181
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.358
What are they doing right like but
that's a reality for

182
00:11:06.358 --> 00:11:09.480
a lot more of the world
than I think we understand.
