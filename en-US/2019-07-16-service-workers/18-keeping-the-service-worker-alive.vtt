00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.570
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The onActivate is
potentially, well actually, definitely in

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.726
our case, it's gonna do some work, and
it's gonna do some asynchronous work.

3
00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:14.430
And there is a concept you need to be
aware of with service workers that when

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.720
they get into these phases, if you are not
careful you may have some stuff that's

5
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.830
happening when the browser decides, you
know what, I'm gonna shut this thing down.

6
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.830
So there's a way for

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.500
you to tell the browser,
I'm still doing stuff, don't shut down.

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.790
It's not a guarantee, but
it's a really strong request

9
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.580
to the browser, I'm still doing important
stuff, please don't shut me down.

10
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.830
And the way you do that is a method that's
been added to these special event objects.

11
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.910
It's called waitUntil, so you're telling
the browser wait until something.

12
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.400
And the thing that you're
gonna pass to it is a promise.

13
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.610
So I'm gonna make another
function called handleActivation,

14
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.980
which is gonna do a bunch of work,
and this is

15
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.510
theoretically then gonna tell the browser,
even if that work is still happening when

16
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.210
you would normally shut down the service
worker please let that work keep going.

17
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.820
So how this might play out might be that a
user bounces onto your site, and then you

18
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.710
start downloading a bunch of content
into their cache, and then they leave.

19
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.260
Do you want for
the cache to be partially filled?

20
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.730
Probably not.

21
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.620
You can gracefully handle that and we're
gonna be dealing with strategies where

22
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.270
the cache, we're checking each item
to see if it's in the cache, but

23
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.730
you probably don't want things
in an inconsistent state.

24
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.190
So here you're basically saying,

25
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.490
don't shut my service worker down until
I'm done loading up all my cache stuff.

26
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.330
In which case it might run for
another minute or

27
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.050
two in the background while it's
getting all that information.

28
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.540
It's not a guarantee because if you're
going way too long, eventually the browser

29
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.744
's probably is going to say
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

30
00:01:55.744 --> 00:01:56.972
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: You're dead, but

31
00:01:56.972 --> 00:02:01.340
It's gonna allow it to stay open
longer than it might otherwise.

32
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.040
Okay.

33
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.557
So what's that handleActivation
function gonna look like?
