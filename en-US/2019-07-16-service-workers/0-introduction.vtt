00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:04.153
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: My name's Kyle Simpson,
everybody knows me online as, Getify.

2
00:00:04.153 --> 00:00:07.438
If you don't follow me on Twitter,
or on my Gmail, or

3
00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:10.577
anywhere else online,
you can find me as Getify and

4
00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:15.192
I'll love to hear any thoughts or
feedback or questions that you may have.

5
00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:22.258
This particular workshop topic,
is much more out of my normal wheelhouse.

6
00:00:22.258 --> 00:00:26.007
Any of you that have seen me teach before,
the many workshops I have here

7
00:00:26.007 --> 00:00:30.258
on Frontend Masters, I'm all about
teaching the core JavaScript language, or

8
00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:32.214
maybe like patterns in JavaScript.

9
00:00:32.214 --> 00:00:35.376
Like functional programming or
things like that, and

10
00:00:35.376 --> 00:00:38.959
I don't often venture into
the Frontend programming world.

11
00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:44.049
I don't venture much beyond,
for example, NodeJS,

12
00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.377
so, this will be a fun and
exciting exercise.

13
00:00:48.377 --> 00:00:52.550
I basically begged the Frontend Masters
people, to let me come and teach this,

14
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.555
because it's something that
I'm super interested in.

15
00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.384
But it's not something that I'm
necessarily really an expert at,

16
00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:02.084
it's kind of a newer
thing that I'm learning.

17
00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:04.976
And there are a lot of people,
maybe even some of you,

18
00:01:04.976 --> 00:01:07.951
that have more experience with this stuff,
than I do.

19
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:09.901
But probably last summer,

20
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:15.680
is when I really got interested in the
topic of service workers, in particular.

21
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.539
So that's what we're gonna be focusing
on today, is service workers and

22
00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:19.287
how we write them.

23
00:01:19.287 --> 00:01:21.842
What they are for and how we write them,

24
00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:25.338
how we position them within
a website in particular.

25
00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:30.606
And I say, website on purpose, because
most of the other materials that are out

26
00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:35.886
there that talk about service workers,
seem to focus on progressive web apps.

27
00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:39.258
And I just wanna give a quick
note about progressive web apps.

28
00:01:39.258 --> 00:01:44.891
That's how I actually first started
experiencing them, last summer, I decided

29
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:49.355
I wanted to build myself a progressive
web app, to install on my phone.

30
00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:52.967
It's a little app, that lets you take
notes when you're at a restaurant and

31
00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:55.633
then be reminded when you
come back to that restaurant.

32
00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:59.494
And I wanted to build that app for myself
and I wanted to do it with web technology.

33
00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.237
I don't wanna go learn Java,

34
00:02:01.237 --> 00:02:04.941
or whatever you use on iOS these days,
I can't keep up with it.

35
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:06.734
But I didn't wanna learn any of that,

36
00:02:06.734 --> 00:02:09.657
I just wanted to use the good old
web technologies that I knew.

37
00:02:09.657 --> 00:02:13.503
And so I did dive in for
the first time, to service workers and

38
00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:15.549
try to figure out how they work.

39
00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.182
And I was doing exactly what any of
you have done, if you have tried,

40
00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:25.654
which is just randomly googling around
saying, somebody tell me what this is.

41
00:02:25.654 --> 00:02:28.401
I do wanna point out,
I've got in the links here,

42
00:02:28.401 --> 00:02:32.658
I found about halfway through that
journey, that one of my favorite people on

43
00:02:32.658 --> 00:02:36.541
the Internet Jeremy Keith had written
a book called, Going Offline.

44
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.516
And this is an absolutely fantastic book,
so, please go buy that book.

45
00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:44.581
It's one of the best resources I've found
for trying to sift through this stuff.

46
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:49.371
But there's still just lots and lots of
bits and pieces, incomplete information.

47
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:51.321
There's lots of reference on MDN,

48
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:54.447
there's lots of write ups that
Google has done about it.

49
00:02:54.447 --> 00:02:58.194
But trying to piece together, all of
these things, is a very manual process.

50
00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:02.468
And literally the code that we'll be going
through today, was done exactly that way.

51
00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:06.542
I set out with, here's what I kinda
wanna build and I know the pieces, but

52
00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:08.468
I'm gonna have to fiddle with it.

53
00:03:08.468 --> 00:03:12.225
And I spend a lot of time fiddling with
it, and trying it and trying it over and

54
00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:13.299
over and over again.

55
00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.283
So, I certainly am not at the place where
I can just write this stuff perfectly from

56
00:03:18.283 --> 00:03:21.986
scratch, and I don't think
that's even reasonable to do.

57
00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:25.490
A couple of things to point out,
there are in here,

58
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.374
a couple of resources that you should know
about, in particular this one on work box.

59
00:03:31.374 --> 00:03:34.416
That is a framework for
writing service workers, so

60
00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:38.646
it's a library framework thing that
you load into your service worker.

61
00:03:38.646 --> 00:03:44.456
It has a variety of APIs for
declaratively setting stuff up.

62
00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:47.736
I think it's a great idea to have
something like this, because,

63
00:03:47.736 --> 00:03:52.032
quite frankly, many of you are probably
gonna get pretty intimidated pretty quick,

64
00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.856
when you see just how much
code we're gonna be writing.

65
00:03:54.856 --> 00:03:57.069
I'm actually excited by writing,

66
00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.396
by being able to write my own
code in a service worker.

67
00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:04.492
So I went the opposite direction,
instead of using a framework or library,

68
00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:08.716
I really wanted to have all of that fine
grained control and with that control,

69
00:04:08.716 --> 00:04:10.639
comes an understanding of things.

70
00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.525
And I really wanted to understand,
what was possible, what I could do.

71
00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:18.364
And there's a lot of things that are
possible, that don't even get talked about

72
00:04:18.364 --> 00:04:21.253
and we'll kind of cover those
various things as we go along.

73
00:04:21.253 --> 00:04:26.086
But, I certainly understand that, if you
are trying to get something shipped at

74
00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:30.081
work, you don't have a lot of time
to just, green field explore.

75
00:04:30.081 --> 00:04:35.515
And that would be, a really great starting
point, to get a service worker up and

76
00:04:35.515 --> 00:04:39.419
going, that would be a really
great starting point for.

77
00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.307
So, back to what I was
saying a moment ago,

78
00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:45.446
about the idea of sites
versus applications.

79
00:04:45.446 --> 00:04:48.359
Everybody seems to think
about it in terms of apps,

80
00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:51.902
that's where I started learning and
building was with apps.

81
00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:56.344
But, I am gonna talk to you today,
about using service

82
00:04:56.344 --> 00:05:00.989
workers with everything
that's not a web application.

83
00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:05.811
Because I think, well, one of the things
that we have missed on the web,

84
00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:07.392
and by missed, I mean,

85
00:05:07.392 --> 00:05:12.235
I think we didn't realize how important
this was a long, long time ago.

86
00:05:12.235 --> 00:05:16.813
If we'd realized a long, long time
ago how important this problem is,

87
00:05:16.813 --> 00:05:21.867
I think we would've had something like
service workers, a decade or two ago.

88
00:05:21.867 --> 00:05:25.504
And I'm not even sure whether
the technology platform was mature enough

89
00:05:25.504 --> 00:05:26.046
for that.

90
00:05:26.046 --> 00:05:29.801
But it would have been a problem that we
had been trying to solve a lot earlier.

91
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:32.432
And it feels relatively,
not that solved, and so

92
00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:36.820
when you hear people talk about service
workers, they immediately think, well,

93
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.531
I'm not building an app,
so, I don't need them.

94
00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:44.089
And the claim that I'm going to make and
I'm hoping to enable,

95
00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:48.819
at least, from a creative thinking
perspective, all of you that

96
00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:53.893
are watching this to do is,
I'm gonna make the claim that literally,

97
00:05:53.893 --> 00:05:58.371
every single website on the internet
needs a service worker.

98
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:02.814
Every single website,
I mean the static, one pager,

99
00:06:02.814 --> 00:06:05.816
that somebody wrote 20 years ago.

100
00:06:05.816 --> 00:06:09.310
And I mean, the fancy,
Gmails of the world, and

101
00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.350
I mean everything in between,
I think they all need a service worker.

102
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.708
And I think that, as we are moving into
this age of taking advantage of the web

103
00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:24.897
platform, we get focused on the shiny
stuff, like, I got CSS Grid,

104
00:06:24.897 --> 00:06:30.215
or I got this, and now I have these,
like progressive retina images.

105
00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:34.078
And I've got all these crazy web fonts,
and I've got SVG and I've got animations.

106
00:06:34.078 --> 00:06:38.317
We get focused, and rightly so,
those are fun and exciting things,

107
00:06:38.317 --> 00:06:40.449
we get focused on the shiny stuff.

108
00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.916
But I think we forget some of
the most important base plumbing

109
00:06:44.916 --> 00:06:46.852
fundamentals of the web.

110
00:06:46.852 --> 00:06:51.229
And I think the web got it wrong,
web and, by web I mean broadly,

111
00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:55.216
the browser technology,
I think we got something wrong.

112
00:06:55.216 --> 00:06:59.381
And service workers, at least the way
that I've positioned in my mind,

113
00:06:59.381 --> 00:07:01.100
they go to trying to fix that.

114
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.244
The thing that I'm talking about, is that,

115
00:07:04.244 --> 00:07:09.554
we have always had some notion of
information being cached in our browsers.

116
00:07:09.554 --> 00:07:12.746
And we often think of, well,
because I have it cached,

117
00:07:12.746 --> 00:07:16.411
it means I don't have to reload it
the next time I go to the website.

118
00:07:16.411 --> 00:07:19.307
That's unfortunately, not really the case.

119
00:07:19.307 --> 00:07:23.817
If you were to dig into the source
code of a browser, and look at all of

120
00:07:23.817 --> 00:07:28.885
the different paths that it goes through,
to decide when it sees a request,

121
00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:33.633
whether or not to try to load it from
cache, to even look in the cache, or

122
00:07:33.633 --> 00:07:38.184
load it from cache versus getting
it from a server, or what it does.

123
00:07:38.184 --> 00:07:41.724
You'd probably be blown away,
at just how complex that is.

124
00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:44.490
It's not a binary decision like,
it's in the cache, I use it,

125
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.132
or it's not in the cache, and I don't.

126
00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.904
And I think that's one of the problems
that we have, is that we've so

127
00:07:49.904 --> 00:07:54.331
simplistically cemented in our mind,
something so uninteresting as caching,

128
00:07:54.331 --> 00:07:57.535
that we just think the browser
takes care of that for me.

129
00:07:57.535 --> 00:08:01.440
In our interest this morning, many of you
talked about being all over the world, and

130
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.826
all these different places.

131
00:08:02.826 --> 00:08:06.228
I travel for work, I'm all over
the place and just a few days,

132
00:08:06.228 --> 00:08:09.776
I'll be in Lithuania, and
then I'll be in other parts abroad.

133
00:08:09.776 --> 00:08:14.756
And that means I spend most of my time,
not on my home WiFi or

134
00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:21.986
in my nice United States of America, high
speed, WiFi connection, sort of stuff.

135
00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:26.899
I use T-Mobile was my mobile provider,
and that means that I get,

136
00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:29.288
free internet everywhere I go.

137
00:08:29.288 --> 00:08:34.059
But it's at 2G speeds, so
that's the downside of it,

138
00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:38.536
and I can pay like $50
a month to upgrade it to 4G.

139
00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:42.951
But I'm cheap like that, I don't normally
do that, unless I'm gonna be somewhere for

140
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.616
a long time.

141
00:08:43.616 --> 00:08:48.312
A few weeks in Australia, yeah, I'm gonna
pay to upgrade, but if it's a few days,

142
00:08:48.312 --> 00:08:51.439
I just suffer through the 2G experiences,
of the web.

143
00:08:51.439 --> 00:08:57.488
And so, maybe more than most, I get to see
firsthand, what it's like when we build,

144
00:08:57.488 --> 00:09:02.890
not only slow experiences, but
basically broken experiences for people.

145
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.048
And we get so myopically focused on,
well, my boss and my sales and

146
00:09:07.048 --> 00:09:12.472
marketing departments, tell me that all of
our customers have high speed Internet and

147
00:09:12.472 --> 00:09:17.075
they access us at home, on a desktop
computer, with a high end monitor and

148
00:09:17.075 --> 00:09:18.217
stuff like that.

149
00:09:18.217 --> 00:09:22.403
We get so focused on that's for
our customers that we forget,

150
00:09:22.403 --> 00:09:24.910
the fact that customers are mobile.

151
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:27.004
This is one of the things
I think that we've missed.

152
00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:31.194
We forget the fact, that I can be your
customer here in the United States of

153
00:09:31.194 --> 00:09:34.844
America, and I can load up your website,
and I can be thinking,

154
00:09:34.844 --> 00:09:37.773
I wanna buy something from you or
pay for a service.

155
00:09:37.773 --> 00:09:42.658
And then, in the middle of that decision,
get on a plane and

156
00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:49.032
fly to Lithuania or some other bizarre,
far off, exotic place, wherever.

157
00:09:49.032 --> 00:09:54.122
And I get off the plane and I connect to
my 2G speeds and I'm still your customer.

158
00:09:54.122 --> 00:09:58.402
And I still want to experience
the web exactly like I did before, and

159
00:09:58.402 --> 00:10:02.907
guess what, I'm willing to tolerate
the idea that it's not gonna be as

160
00:10:02.907 --> 00:10:04.727
perfect as it was back home.

161
00:10:04.727 --> 00:10:09.076
But there's a difference between I'm
willing to tolerate a degraded experience,

162
00:10:09.076 --> 00:10:12.272
and I'm willing to just
essentially assume, I get nothing.

163
00:10:12.272 --> 00:10:15.282
I literally get nothing
because nothing will load.

164
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:19.698
For example, many, many times,
I'll be sitting in an airport, bored,

165
00:10:19.698 --> 00:10:23.483
waiting to get on the plane, and
I'll see a tweet that comes by,

166
00:10:23.483 --> 00:10:27.640
with a blog post and it looks interesting,
so I click on the blog post.

167
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.901
I start reading the first two paragraphs
and then they board us on the plane.

168
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:33.349
So I go put the phone in my pocket,
I get on the plane,

169
00:10:33.349 --> 00:10:36.104
I'm in the middle of that blog
post I'm still reading it.

170
00:10:36.104 --> 00:10:39.001
I want to see what that
blog post has to say.

171
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:42.447
I go get on the plane,
we turn our phones into airplane mode,

172
00:10:42.447 --> 00:10:46.789
I’m thirty thousand feet in the air,
there is no WiFi on this stupid plane.

173
00:10:46.789 --> 00:10:53.539
And I open up your blog page, and I get
a blank white, failed to load screen.

174
00:10:53.539 --> 00:10:58.304
Why is it that I had that content, before
I took off, and I didn't do anything,

175
00:10:58.304 --> 00:11:02.590
it’s navigated around and
went to a whole different website.

176
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.198
It's still an open tab in
my mobile browser, but

177
00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:08.840
I get on the plane, and it's gone.

178
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.800
And there's actually a thousand different
reasons why that I might have happened.

179
00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:15.794
The website might have had dynamic
resources in the background,

180
00:11:15.794 --> 00:11:19.069
that tried to make a request, and
that might have been why it happened.

181
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:23.363
It's actually, probably an ad that
messed it up, that did that to my site.

182
00:11:23.363 --> 00:11:26.835
But whatever the reason is,
now I don't have your blog post and for

183
00:11:26.835 --> 00:11:29.878
the next three hours,
I cannot read what I wanted to read.

184
00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:33.742
I think that's what we've
missed about the web,

185
00:11:33.742 --> 00:11:37.606
is that we've made these
terrible assumptions,

186
00:11:37.606 --> 00:11:42.575
that people are gonna experience the web,
in a contiguous way.

187
00:11:42.575 --> 00:11:45.192
That when you sit down to
experience something about the web,

188
00:11:45.192 --> 00:11:46.712
you're not gonna be interrupted.

189
00:11:46.712 --> 00:11:50.265
You're gonna have perfect WiFi,
perfect Internet connectivity,

190
00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:51.558
perfect battery power.

191
00:11:51.558 --> 00:11:55.181
You're never going to have any
sort of interruption to that,

192
00:11:55.181 --> 00:11:57.487
that's the way that we design the web.

193
00:11:57.487 --> 00:12:01.381
And the reality is that,
that's not the way the web is experienced,

194
00:12:01.381 --> 00:12:04.015
by the vast majority of
the human population.

195
00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:08.632
It's a very vanishingly small amount of
us, that get to have the privilege of

196
00:12:08.632 --> 00:12:12.197
experiencing this continuous perfect web,
all the time.

197
00:12:12.197 --> 00:12:16.507
And it's, like such a first world
privilege problem when we're like, my God,

198
00:12:16.507 --> 00:12:19.415
GitHub took four seconds to load,
what are they doing?

199
00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:23.573
All right, like, but that's a reality,
for a lot more of the world,

200
00:12:23.573 --> 00:12:25.280
than I think we understand.
