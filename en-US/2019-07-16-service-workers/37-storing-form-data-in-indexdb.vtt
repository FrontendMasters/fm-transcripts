00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.090
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: There's one last thing
I wanna walk you through doing, and

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.260
that is just one little final piece
of polish on the user experience.

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.188
If I come to slash login,
and I log into this

4
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.372
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Application, if I have

5
00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:27.528
been typing out a really awesome blog

6
00:00:27.528 --> 00:00:36.902
post,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And

7
00:00:36.902 --> 00:00:41.788
I've written out this whole long blog
post, and then something happens and

8
00:00:41.788 --> 00:00:42.716
I go offline.

9
00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:45.765
And I go to click this Add Post button,
and

10
00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.450
all I get is an error like you're down.

11
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.780
Well then, I'm like shoot,
I gotta save this somewhere because I'm

12
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.600
worried if I go away I'm
gonna lose all this.

13
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.570
So I'm copying this into my own
text editor to try to save it,

14
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.750
and then I'm gonna try to remember to come
back later and post this or whatever.

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.710
This is a perfect opportunity where,
again, I'm doing it for blog posting,

16
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.660
but this would be more like for
a comment section on a blog, for example.

17
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.890
It's a perfect opportunity where what
we could be doing is trying to help

18
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.010
out the user.

19
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.098
So what I have in this final revision, and

20
00:01:19.098 --> 00:01:22.211
this is the version of the code
you have in your solution file.

21
00:01:22.211 --> 00:01:27.290
What I have in this final revision is
that under the covers, as I change

22
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.645
the input box and the blog post text,
I'm saving that data to IndexedDB.

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.610
So it's being saved in an offline safe
way in the background of this website.

24
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.580
And I can access IndexedDB
from both places.

25
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.690
I can access it from the page,
which is what I'm doing here, and

26
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.430
I can also access it
in the service worker.

27
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.742
So what I'm doing is that if I
have saved this information and

28
00:01:52.742 --> 00:01:56.899
I click Add Post, I can now tell hey,
you're not online.

29
00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.915
So I'm gonna give you a friendlier
message that says you seem to be offline,

30
00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:01.620
currently.

31
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.800
Please try posting once
you come back online.

32
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.558
But even if I go away, I go away from
the page or I close the tab entirely,

33
00:02:11.558 --> 00:02:16.868
if I come back to that page,
guess what's still there?

34
00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:20.691
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: My content was
saved in an offline form, and

35
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:24.500
then restored because this
hasn't been posted yet.

36
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.340
Now, let's say later I get off
the airplane and I'm back online,

37
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.850
and now I can see I'm online,
and I'm like click Add Post.

38
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.830
Well now, I want for
that IndexedDB to get cleared out.

39
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.930
So when I click the Add Post,
once the service worker detects

40
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.000
that it was successfully sent to
the server, the service worker clears

41
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.110
out the IndexedDB because now
we're done with that content.

42
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.939
So I click Add Post.

43
00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.191
And now, if I come back to
Add Post it's been cleared out.

44
00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:01.037
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So just real quickly,

45
00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:05.576
we'll take a look at how that code
is working in our service worker.

46
00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:07.530
Let's look at that side first.

47
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.830
In our service worker, in our router,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Down here at the bottom.

48
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:15.980
Specifically here,

49
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.030
I have some handling to clear
the offline backup of a successful post.

50
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.876
So if the request URL was API Add Post,
and I know that it was successful,

51
00:03:24.876 --> 00:03:29.962
then I'm gonna call this library which
I've loaded in, gives you a promise

52
00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:35.550
interface for IndexedDB, and I'm gonna
delete the post backup that was created.

53
00:03:42.225 --> 00:03:47.048
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I mean,
I meant to say there's other reasons for

54
00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:50.470
you to wanna access your IndexDB.

55
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.560
You might wanna actually get
that content and send it.

56
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.830
So we talked about,
remember, background sync.

57
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.840
If that API was running here in
the background, and then at some point it

58
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.130
detected that we were online, it could
grab it out of IndexDBand send it off to

59
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.220
the server for me without me even having
to reload the page to put it back in.

60
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.470
And then, of course,
we would wanna delete it.

61
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.850
All right, so
let's look at the Add Post page.

62
00:04:16.497 --> 00:04:20.036
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Basically,
all I really need to do is listen for

63
00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:24.310
the change event on those
input in text area boxes.

64
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.770
And when I get called, I'm just gonna set

65
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.127
an object in memory that holds
the current value of those things.

66
00:04:31.127 --> 00:04:34.640
So every time those are changed,
I'm gonna save that data into there.

67
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.510
You could actually do it on every key
stroke if you really wanted to be

68
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.090
aggressive about the saving of it.

69
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.570
But here, I'm just doing it whenever you
unfocus from it and it's been changed.

70
00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.260
By the way, I exposed the function
in my blog that let's me know from

71
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.125
the Add Post whether I'm online.

72
00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:56.990
It just exposes that Boolean variable,
and that's when I

73
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.250
give you this special message that
says you seem to be offline currently.
