00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.510
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
that's our most basic of logic.

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.350
We're using one single strategy for
all of our requests, and I'm

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.630
going to tell you off the bat that it's
not going to work for all of our requests.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.140
So we're gonna have
broken parts of our site.

5
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.500
We're not gonna be able to
do the login and APIs and

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.930
stuff like this, but that's okay.

7
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.310
We're just gonna test
to see if the basic and

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.940
we click around pages
part is working here.

9
00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:30.150
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So we've updated
our version of our service worker.

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.730
Let's come over here and because
this is a pretty substantial change,

11
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.030
I'm just gonna go ahead and manually
stop and unregister my service worker.

12
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.570
Clear out all these logs.

13
00:00:47.776 --> 00:00:51.300
And then we'll try to refresh the page,

14
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.330
should see, did I not update my version?

15
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.980
I thought I did.

16
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.180
Yep, need to update the version just so
we're on the right track.

17
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.183
So let's do that again.

18
00:01:07.603 --> 00:01:14.488
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Clear this out,
clear the cache, stop the service worker,

19
00:01:14.488 --> 00:01:19.330
unregister, clear the network cache.

20
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.730
You can see there's a whole bunch of

21
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.730
ritual that you get involved with as you
start developing against service workers.

22
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.250
Okay, let's try it again, we refresh, now
we're loading service worker version five.

23
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.790
Look at our network,
it definitely loaded a bunch of stuff.

24
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.780
I don't see any major errors,
so that's a good sign.

25
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.730
Let's come over to our application tab,

26
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.120
we have a cache storage
with some stuff in it.

27
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.980
So that's a good sign.

28
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.320
Now let's do our most basic of tests.

29
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.160
Let's try going offline.

30
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.260
So that's under the Network tab.

31
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.310
We're gonna check the offline button.

32
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.046
And now,
you notice the page says we're offline.

33
00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:03.970
Let's cross our fingers and

34
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.390
hope that when we click the contact,
what did we do wrong?

35
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.910
I forgot to use the new operator
on the URL constructor.

36
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.882
It's the little details, isn't it?

37
00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:23.579
All right, let's go back,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: To

38
00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.880
our fetch handler, our router rather.

39
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.751
Gotta say new URL.

40
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.837
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's try this again.

41
00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.260
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Clear out,
make sure to turn it back online.

42
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.040
Clear out.

43
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.010
Cash has been cleared.

44
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.300
It's been cleared because we
aren't on that page anymore.

45
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.704
Okay, so let's try to refresh.

46
00:03:11.161 --> 00:03:13.590
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We'll just clear
all this out one more time.

47
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.317
So we're making sure
we're on a very clean,

48
00:03:21.197 --> 00:03:25.796
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, we can see it seems

49
00:03:25.796 --> 00:03:32.587
to be working fine so now let's go and

50
00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:36.320
switch to offline.

51
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.794
And I hope this works.

52
00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:45.252
We have a page that we served offline.

53
00:03:45.252 --> 00:03:48.460
That's a huge big step, isn't it?

54
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.520
We've been building up for the last
multiple hours just to get to that one

55
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.160
little thing, it almost feels
a little anti climatic, doesn't it?

56
00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.450
[LAUGH] But
we are actually able to serve these pages.

57
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.781
And you'll notice obviously that
the style CSS and all those,

58
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:07.569
those are also being served up offline.

59
00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.900
Okay, let's make one
other test really quick.

60
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.920
By the way, if you're wondering why you're
getting all these network failures in

61
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.260
here, it's because in our service worker,

62
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.100
we're unconditionally making the fetch
request, even when we know we're offline.

63
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.890
So your service worker is trying to
make a request and it's failing.

64
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.390
And that's why that's gonna show up there.

65
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.260
And also in your logs,
you're gonna see stuff like that.

66
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.960
This one, by the way, it's failing
to load the new service worker

67
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.790
because it's trying to check
the service worker every time.

68
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.230
But anyway, this is okay.

69
00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.710
This is not a bad thing, except you
might want to just skip the attempt

70
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.330
at a network request,
if is online is false.

71
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.240
There's no reason
the frustratingly try that, okay?

72
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.820
So we're going to go back online.

73
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.660
Clear out all our log stuff.

74
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.460
And our page still works, which is good.

75
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.210
We're back online.

76
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.481
But now, let's see what
happens if we kill the server.

77
00:05:31.114 --> 00:05:33.120
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's
try to kill our server.

78
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:43.280
And let's go back to that page and
let's click, and it still works.

79
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.420
So we are online but
those fetches to the server

80
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.710
are still failing because they're
not able to reach to a server.

81
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.250
And then we fall back because those fail,
we fall back to our cache entries and

82
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.470
still serve a graceful
experience to the end user.
