00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.342
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have a project.

2
00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:04.955
You're gonna apply everything
you just learned here, and

3
00:00:04.955 --> 00:00:06.950
whoever makes the smallest container wins.

4
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.123
No, I'm just kidding,
that's a joke [LAUGH].

5
00:00:09.123 --> 00:00:16.079
You can do this however you want to, but
I'm gonna have you build an Astro project.

6
00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.697
And I had it built with Astro and
React and TypeScript and Tailwind and

7
00:00:20.697 --> 00:00:25.313
the reason why I'm doing that is I'm
not actually using any of them in

8
00:00:25.313 --> 00:00:30.668
the project I just wanted you to have
a bunch of dependencies to install, okay?

9
00:00:30.668 --> 00:00:35.707
And you can either start from
an npx create astro@latest on

10
00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:41.772
your local development environment,
or you can just use my copy of it.

11
00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:45.287
I added Tailwind and react to it,
but you don't have to,

12
00:00:45.287 --> 00:00:48.083
it effectively ends up
being the same thing.

13
00:00:48.083 --> 00:00:51.523
But here's what I want you to do.

14
00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:55.156
I want you to have a multi stage
build where you're going to take

15
00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:58.173
your Astro project,
you're going to build it, and

16
00:00:58.173 --> 00:01:01.533
then you're going to copy it
into an nginx container, and

17
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:05.669
that NGINX container is then going
to run your project for you, right?

18
00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:07.746
It's gonna distribute it, right?

19
00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:11.784
Cuz think about an Astro project once you
build it is just static assets, right?

20
00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:15.507
It's HTML, it's CSS,
it's Javascript, it's images.

21
00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:18.103
There's nothing dynamic or server or

22
00:01:18.103 --> 00:01:22.733
nodey about what's to be being
distributed to the public, right?

23
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:29.156
So, in your production container,
you don't want node, for example, right?

24
00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:32.843
So what you're gonna do is you're gonna
have a build container that is gonna have

25
00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:33.396
node in it.

26
00:01:33.396 --> 00:01:35.301
It's gonna build the project,

27
00:01:35.301 --> 00:01:40.033
it's going to copy that all over into
a very special directory inside of NGINX.

28
00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.264
That nginx is then gonna serve for you.

29
00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:46.737
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
I have a link here for you.

30
00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:48.338
Feel free to just go ahead and

31
00:01:48.338 --> 00:01:52.897
use this if you don't feel like actually
creating your Astro project yourself.

32
00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:57.199
And then go ahead and
figure out how to do a Dockerfile.

33
00:01:57.199 --> 00:02:00.548
There is a solution.dockerfile here,
right here.

34
00:02:00.548 --> 00:02:02.083
This is the answer.

35
00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:07.766
I would invite you to try to do this
yourself before you look at my solution.

36
00:02:07.766 --> 00:02:12.870
But I'm gonna give you a bit of time
to go ahead and go and try and do that.

37
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.759
And then we'll come back and
I'll walk you through my solution.

38
00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:21.329
There's a couple of things I want
just some caveats to give you here.

39
00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.034
Please make a multi-stage Dockerfile,
I think we talked about that.

40
00:02:27.034 --> 00:02:30.859
And then,
have another container that can be NGINX.

41
00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:32.591
It can be NGINX Alpine.

42
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:37.018
There's a bunch of different
flavors of NGINX as well.

43
00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.228
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
either one of those there.

44
00:02:41.228 --> 00:02:43.460
Make sure you're copying
just the newly built files.

45
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.568
Don't include the source files,

46
00:02:47.568 --> 00:02:54.231
which will be the dist directory
inside of the project.

47
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:59.482
And then make sure you copy
that to /user/share/nginx/html.

48
00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:02.050
You don't have to do
anything else with nginx.

49
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.394
If you put everything
here in that directory,

50
00:03:04.394 --> 00:03:06.797
it knows what to do with
them automatically, so

51
00:03:06.797 --> 00:03:10.783
you don't have to do any configuration,
and nginx will take care of the rest.

52
00:03:10.783 --> 00:03:13.335
So you don't even have
to have a CMD in it.

53
00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:18.081
Don't have a CMD on that last line
because nginx already has one and

54
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:20.298
you wanna use the default one.

55
00:03:20.298 --> 00:03:22.094
So do not include your own CMD.
