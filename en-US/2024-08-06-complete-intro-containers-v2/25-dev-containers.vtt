00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:03.196
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's go on to dev containers.

2
00:00:03.196 --> 00:00:07.658
I think that's this is something
that's going to apply more

3
00:00:07.658 --> 00:00:10.027
directly to a bunch of you here.

4
00:00:10.027 --> 00:00:13.071
How many of you have joined the company,
and

5
00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:17.935
it's taken you two weeks to get your
development environment set up?

6
00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:19.346
Yeah, when I was at Netflix,

7
00:00:19.346 --> 00:00:22.060
I don't think I was able to
ship code at least for a month.

8
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.886
And I don't think I'm even
exaggerating because at the time,

9
00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:30.869
they have a phenomenal interesting system
for development servers, but it's so

10
00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.821
hard to get it.

11
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:36.553
Cuz you just have to, what I said here,
you have to get mercury and retrograde and

12
00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:41.654
you have to align the stars for everything
to work, but when it works, it's amazing.

13
00:00:41.654 --> 00:00:45.875
That's kind of the problem that dev
containers are aiming to solve,

14
00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:48.567
that you don't have to have these bespoke,

15
00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:53.838
highly artisanal development environments
that you have to spend weeks setting up.

16
00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:58.183
Ideally, you can just sit down and
say, Docker compose operas or

17
00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:03.175
something like that and everything
just starts working on your computer.

18
00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:09.351
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not always one to one that
way it's like kinda the dream of vagrant,

19
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.007
does anyone remember vagrant?

20
00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:12.921
Or am I old now?

21
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.935
I think I'm old now.

22
00:01:13.935 --> 00:01:19.377
Anyway, vagrant was
HashiCorp's very first product.

23
00:01:19.377 --> 00:01:25.249
And when HashiCorp was really
just Mitchell Hashimoto.

24
00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:28.483
Anyway, let's talk about this.

25
00:01:28.483 --> 00:01:31.184
So we're gonna build a Ruby
on Rails project, and

26
00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:35.766
the first thing you should say is, Brian,
you don't know Ruby and you are correct.

27
00:01:35.766 --> 00:01:40.156
I do not know Ruby, but I chose this
project specifically to prove you to

28
00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:43.376
the that it doesn't matter
that I don't know Ruby,

29
00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:47.055
that we can get this set up with
like no problem whatsoever.

30
00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:52.543
So I'm gonna copy this, I have this
running locally, or I have all the files.

31
00:01:52.543 --> 00:01:56.898
Really, all I did with this Rails project
is just do like the Rails new project,

32
00:01:56.898 --> 00:01:58.850
I didn't do anything beyond that.

33
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.916
Because again, I do not know Ruby.

34
00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:03.216
So I have it

35
00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:11.654
in personal/container-projects,

36
00:02:11.654 --> 00:02:14.471
there it is.

37
00:02:14.471 --> 00:02:18.134
And I have it, I think it's in,
is it in dev containers?

38
00:02:18.134 --> 00:02:18.801
Is that where I put it?

39
00:02:27.954 --> 00:02:30.783
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So all right, that's fine.

40
00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:44.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Docker-volume, difficulty
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,

41
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.597
so now I have my dev containers project,
and

42
00:02:49.597 --> 00:02:55.522
we're gonna open that in code,
I'll close that one.

43
00:02:55.522 --> 00:02:58.389
So spoiler alert, but
we'll get there in just a second.

44
00:03:02.312 --> 00:03:06.668
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, so if you do this
in VS Code, which you don't have to, but

45
00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:10.078
I am, obviously, for
purely unbiased reasons.

46
00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:15.668
It's gonna ask you,
do you wanna reopen this in a container?

47
00:03:15.668 --> 00:03:18.764
So I would say yes, to do it.

48
00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:22.956
I am gonna show you just really quick,
cuz this used to frustrate me.

49
00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:26.452
If you accidentally missed that,
but you still wanted to do it,

50
00:03:26.452 --> 00:03:30.748
that's what this little, logo down here
in the bottom left, this green one.

51
00:03:30.748 --> 00:03:34.056
You can just say Reopen in Container,
if you click on that.

52
00:03:34.056 --> 00:03:36.710
You can also do it through
the command palette.

53
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.008
So command P or,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Ctrl+P, and

54
00:03:41.008 --> 00:03:44.850
then just put the angle bracket there, and

55
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.519
then you can say reopen in container,
that also works as well.

56
00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.638
Anyway, we're gonna do it here,
reopen a container.

57
00:03:53.638 --> 00:03:59.680
It's gonna restart it, you can say,
it's gonna open all of this stuff.

58
00:04:00.802 --> 00:04:02.309
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna
do all of my installations,

59
00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:03.515
it's gonna do a bunch of stuff.

60
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:14.077
It's gonna have a problem with
my Ruby version, apparently.

61
00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:18.577
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Global, sure,
I don't know, whatever, Ruby.

62
00:04:18.577 --> 00:04:23.486
I'm sure I'm offending so
many Ruby developers, and I don't care.

63
00:04:23.486 --> 00:04:24.368
Okay, that's fine.

64
00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.452
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It wants my
Ruby file in particular.

65
00:04:39.335 --> 00:04:44.186
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

66
00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:49.398
point being, were you all seeing that
as well the same kind of Ruby error?

67
00:04:49.398 --> 00:04:50.654
Okay, good to know.

68
00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:58.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you can see here
I am inside of a Ruby environment.

69
00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:01.096
If I say cat /etc/ issue.

70
00:05:01.096 --> 00:05:04.925
You can see that I am inside of Debian 11.

71
00:05:04.925 --> 00:05:11.591
Yeah, let me get through
what the notes say here.

72
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.146
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: An interesting,
I don't think I have Ruby installed in my

73
00:05:17.146 --> 00:05:23.398
computer, but if I say ruby -v,
you can see it's on ruby 3.3, that's good.

74
00:05:23.398 --> 00:05:26.582
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I should be able to say rails server

75
00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:36.548
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then it should

76
00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:38.276
ask you do you wanna open this in Browser?

77
00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:41.387
You can say Open in Browser.

78
00:05:41.387 --> 00:05:48.201
And this is all now running directly
from a container on my computer.

79
00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:51.920
Again, as you saw here,
I do not know what I am doing, right?

80
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:57.085
But it's pretty cool that someone
smarter than me can come before me and

81
00:05:57.085 --> 00:06:00.612
set all this stuff up so
that I can just say, yes,

82
00:06:00.612 --> 00:06:04.512
reopen in container and
just be an off into the races.

83
00:06:04.512 --> 00:06:06.065
Now I have to admit my bias here,

84
00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.722
I helped with this project
when I worked at Microsoft.

85
00:06:08.722 --> 00:06:13.085
This is a very Microsoft initiative,
but they have kind of spun it out.

86
00:06:13.085 --> 00:06:16.703
It's now owned by GitHub and
not by Microsoft.

87
00:06:16.703 --> 00:06:19.103
And it works with JetBrains.

88
00:06:19.103 --> 00:06:23.938
There's ways to make it work with Vim,
there's even a CLI now that if you don't

89
00:06:23.938 --> 00:06:28.496
wanna be working anywhere near an IDE,
all that kind of stuff still works.

90
00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:32.149
So let's just kind of talk
a little bit about this.

91
00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:36.467
If I'm gonna be working on a project with
anyone that I know, I generally will set

92
00:06:36.467 --> 00:06:40.101
up a DEF container for them so
that they kinda have this experience.

93
00:06:40.101 --> 00:06:42.590
I'll even set it up for myself so
that every time I open my project,

94
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:44.729
it just says, hey,
do you wanna reopen this container?

95
00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.791
And I just say, yes, and I'll set
them in my development environment.

96
00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:54.619
So this one I actually didn't have
to build my own Docker file for.

97
00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:59.431
I was able to just basically pull directly
from the Microsoft dev containers

98
00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:02.898
cuz I have a bunch of them that
are just like ready to go.

99
00:07:02.898 --> 00:07:06.765
You can see here it's pulling from mcr,

100
00:07:06.765 --> 00:07:11.091
that's Microsoft Container Registry, and

101
00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:14.634
it's pulling the ruby 3 bullseye.

102
00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:18.566
It's telling it directly up front, it's,
hey, you're gonna have to forward port

103
00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:21.584
3,000, it'll detect that even
if you don't tell it that.

104
00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:26.189
And then on whenever you create
the project, just run this setup file and

105
00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:30.889
that'll get all of your dependencies
installed automatically for you.

106
00:07:30.889 --> 00:07:33.558
Another cool feature here
that we're not showing you,

107
00:07:33.558 --> 00:07:36.862
you can also set it up with VS code
to install the correct extensions.

108
00:07:36.862 --> 00:07:40.623
So let's say you're in Python and
you wanna have Pylance.

109
00:07:40.623 --> 00:07:44.663
Or if you're doing Jupyter notebooks, you
can have the Jupyter one that and it'll

110
00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:49.012
just install those automatically inside of
the container, and that'll all just work.

111
00:07:49.012 --> 00:07:54.964
And then,
let's look at the remote explorer.

112
00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:57.556
So you can see here I'm running
this dev container here.

113
00:07:57.556 --> 00:08:04.854
It'll tell me a bunch of stuff about
what I'm doing with my dev container.

114
00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:09.320
So there's a bunch of stuff you can
play around here directly from Microsoft

115
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:09.888
as well.

116
00:08:09.888 --> 00:08:12.717
Pretty cool feature, I think.

117
00:08:12.717 --> 00:08:16.121
One thing I was gonna say,
if you can create totally custom

118
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:19.334
docker files as well for
your dev containers, right?

119
00:08:19.334 --> 00:08:21.255
You don't have to use the Microsoft ones.

120
00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:22.185
Generally, they're pretty good.

121
00:08:22.185 --> 00:08:26.103
So I generally, start with the Microsoft
one, and then I build on top of it.

122
00:08:26.103 --> 00:08:30.666
But if you have some wild bespoke
environment that you need,

123
00:08:30.666 --> 00:08:33.983
that's all totally possible here as well.

124
00:08:33.983 --> 00:08:36.976
And in case, it just bears mentioning,

125
00:08:36.976 --> 00:08:41.650
your dev container will not be
the same as your production one.

126
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.857
It's just good to say that out loud.

127
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:48.155
In retrospect,
it might seem a little obvious, but

128
00:08:48.155 --> 00:08:53.835
it's okay that your project has
multiple docker files in it, okay.

129
00:08:56.675 --> 00:08:58.736
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, and
then whenever I close this,

130
00:08:58.736 --> 00:09:00.428
it just shuts it all down for me.

131
00:09:00.428 --> 00:09:03.365
I don't really have to think about it,

132
00:09:03.365 --> 00:09:07.103
because I closed my VS code,
it's just gone now.

133
00:09:07.103 --> 00:09:09.936
So let's look for
a second here at the bottom,

134
00:09:09.936 --> 00:09:12.128
I showed you everything in VS code.

135
00:09:12.128 --> 00:09:15.552
That's because out of the out of the box,
everything just works with VS code.

136
00:09:15.552 --> 00:09:17.352
You'll have to install an extension, but

137
00:09:17.352 --> 00:09:19.402
it should prompt you to
install that extension.

138
00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:22.132
So that shouldn't be that big of a deal.

139
00:09:22.132 --> 00:09:28.229
There's a dev container CLI that handles
all this stuff kind of locally for

140
00:09:28.229 --> 00:09:31.338
you without being attached to an IDE.

141
00:09:31.338 --> 00:09:35.594
This all works in Visual Studio,
probably no surprise there.

142
00:09:35.594 --> 00:09:41.675
IntelliJ now has support for
this as of last year some time.

143
00:09:41.675 --> 00:09:46.875
And then the other thing that I find
extremely useful with this is that,

144
00:09:46.875 --> 00:09:52.088
if you decide to open something in
Code Spaces, it just works, right?

145
00:09:52.088 --> 00:09:57.560
Code Spaces will see as, this person has a
dev container and then it'll make whatever

146
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.512
container that your GitHub Code Spaces
is running in use that dev container.

147
00:10:02.512 --> 00:10:06.014
If you're not familiar with Code Spaces,
it's, if I go to

148
00:10:06.014 --> 00:10:09.738
github/btholds/completeintro-to-container-
s-V2.

149
00:10:09.738 --> 00:10:12.579
And I want it to just work on
this without downloading it.

150
00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.945
I can just say, create Code Space.

151
00:10:18.246 --> 00:10:20.769
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this will open VS Code,

152
00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:25.391
this will open a real
running Linux environment.

153
00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:31.018
This one does not have a dev container
that I haven't put in there,

154
00:10:31.018 --> 00:10:34.650
so it has a generic universal image there.

155
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.358
But pretty cool, I can just start working
on this directly, and it's free, right?

156
00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:39.936
It's free for up to 60 hours per month.
