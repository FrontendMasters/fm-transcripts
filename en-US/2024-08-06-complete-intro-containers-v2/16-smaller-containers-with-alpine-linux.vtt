00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:04.419
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We've just been talking
about how to make containers not really

2
00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:09.248
caring too much about size or, I mean,
we've been talking about security,

3
00:00:09.248 --> 00:00:12.912
inevitably, containers are kind
of a security feature.

4
00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:17.673
But now we're gonna start getting into,
maybe production-izing your containers

5
00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.372
a little bit, how to be a bit more
focused and succinct with them.

6
00:00:21.372 --> 00:00:27.090
So, you can see that the name of my
section here is making tiny containers.

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.390
So, one, let me tell you that I don't know
why, but I love making containers smaller.

8
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.445
It's just like a fun metric to play with,
right?

9
00:00:36.445 --> 00:00:41.406
You do something and you see that it
gets smaller and smaller overtime, and

10
00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:46.306
that just scratches like some video
game playing part of my monkey brain.

11
00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:47.972
That seems very fun to me.

12
00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:53.709
I am going to tell you that,
it's kind of a fool's errand a little bit,

13
00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:58.493
people wanna say that smaller
containers are more secure,

14
00:00:58.493 --> 00:01:00.808
you can't really say that.

15
00:01:00.808 --> 00:01:06.549
You wanna say it, it sounds fun to
say that, but it's not really true.

16
00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.280
Smaller containers are, I'm gonna say
weekly correlated with being more secure,

17
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.176
which is to say, not something you
should probably spend a ton of time on.

18
00:01:19.176 --> 00:01:23.109
And people say, well, it cost less because
you're sending less over the wire and

19
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.771
you have less ingress and egress.

20
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:29.923
And my single axiom that almost always
holds true throughout all of my career is,

21
00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.966
people time is way more expensive
than computer time, right?

22
00:01:33.966 --> 00:01:37.827
You're gonna spend a bunch of time
making your container smaller, and

23
00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:41.876
the salary that they have to pay you to
do that is worth way more than the seven

24
00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.476
megabytes you shaved off
your container size.

25
00:01:44.476 --> 00:01:47.028
So, one, I'm gonna show you how to do it,
and two,

26
00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:50.919
I'm gonna tell you just to be careful
with how obsessed you get with it, right?

27
00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:55.308
Objectively, having less stuff in
your containers is just good, right?

28
00:01:55.308 --> 00:01:58.703
Because you have less surface area, right?

29
00:01:58.703 --> 00:02:03.397
So let's say you have
a Node.js application that has

30
00:02:03.397 --> 00:02:06.013
a Sass built into it, right?

31
00:02:06.013 --> 00:02:10.345
Sass is Ruby-based, or at least was,
isn't anymore, but follow with my example,

32
00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:11.017
if you will.

33
00:02:11.017 --> 00:02:15.480
Let's say that there is a massive Ruby
vulnerability that allows people to take

34
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.960
over your container if it has
Ruby anywhere in the container.

35
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.476
If you use your build container
as your production container and

36
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.747
it has Ruby in it,
that's a problem, right?

37
00:02:26.747 --> 00:02:27.922
Because in theory,

38
00:02:27.922 --> 00:02:31.803
they could get access to it through
the Ruby compromised project.

39
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:35.586
But if you have a tiny container where you
only used Ruby to build the project and

40
00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:38.756
then you took it out afterwards,
you wouldn't have it, right?

41
00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:42.089
You kinda see my point here is,
this is valuable, that you

42
00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:46.659
should only include the things that are
needed to run your app and nothing else.

43
00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:53.640
Just don't get obsessed with the size,
that's my plea here.

44
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:56.522
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
we're gonna start with Alpine Linux,

45
00:02:56.522 --> 00:02:57.794
we've been talking about that.

46
00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:01.220
We're gonna get to dist list
here in just a second, and

47
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.586
then there'll be a little
project at the end for you.

48
00:03:04.586 --> 00:03:08.566
So, Alpine, let's talk about Alpine,
it's been around for a long time.

49
00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.062
I'm a big fan, I've used it over and
over and over again.

50
00:03:11.062 --> 00:03:14.092
You've already used it
probably a dozen times today.

51
00:03:14.092 --> 00:03:17.167
What is it?

52
00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:21.804
Alpine is a Linux distribution that
you would never use as your desktop

53
00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:25.903
distribution, that would be very
painful to try and do that.

54
00:03:25.903 --> 00:03:28.687
Possible, but painful.

55
00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:34.115
But its entire existence is like,
I'm gonna be as small as possible so that

56
00:03:34.115 --> 00:03:39.819
I can do the basics to run a web server or
whatever I wanna do, and nothing else.

57
00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.626
It's based on a distribution that is
called BusyBox, and BusyBox is basically,

58
00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:47.900
their entire existence is like,
we wanna have the least

59
00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.662
amount of stuff possible and still be
considered a Linux distribution, right?

60
00:03:52.662 --> 00:03:57.479
So Alpine is just a smaller layer on top
of that to put in a couple of things on

61
00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.198
top of it.

62
00:03:58.198 --> 00:04:03.175
Everybody uses it, very common, I'll
talk a little bit here in just a second

63
00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:07.693
of why you might not want Alpine, but
I'm also gonna say that so much of

64
00:04:07.693 --> 00:04:12.843
the Internet is run on Alpine, that you're
probably very okay to still use it.

65
00:04:12.843 --> 00:04:14.437
Why have a smaller container?

66
00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:15.958
We talked about some of them.

67
00:04:15.958 --> 00:04:18.871
Another one is, sometimes private

68
00:04:18.871 --> 00:04:23.443
container registries will
charge you by the megabyte.

69
00:04:23.443 --> 00:04:24.406
Who cares, right?

70
00:04:24.406 --> 00:04:27.529
Like, normally,
maybe you're saving 100 bucks, but

71
00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:30.658
they're gonna pay you
$10,000 to figure that out.

72
00:04:30.658 --> 00:04:33.661
Usually, it's not a good thing
to worry too much about.

73
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:38.386
Okay, so in our previous project,

74
00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:43.111
this one here, I'm just gonna go,

75
00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:47.689
say, from node:20-alpine.

76
00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.258
That's it.

77
00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:52.924
I'm gonna come over here.

78
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:59.298
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's call this,
more-complicated-app:alpine.

79
00:05:03.905 --> 00:05:10.019
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I'm gonna go run it.

80
00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:16.027
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I didn't wanna,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's do the

81
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:24.195
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: -P 8080:8080, there we go.

82
00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:29.892
Okay, so as you can see,
if I go look in here and I say,

83
00:05:29.892 --> 00:05:35.750
8080, everything still
works exactly the same.

84
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.162
Nothing changed,
all I did was put -alpine on there.

85
00:05:40.162 --> 00:05:46.987
Now, if I go in here, add this one in use,
you can see more complicated app,

86
00:05:46.987 --> 00:05:51.697
that's one that we built
before 1.1 gigabytes.

87
00:05:51.697 --> 00:05:59.974
You can see more complicated app here
with a tag of Alpine, 142 megabytes.

88
00:05:59.974 --> 00:06:03.862
Pretty substantial difference,

89
00:06:03.862 --> 00:06:08.021
with adding what, six characters?

90
00:06:08.021 --> 00:06:10.805
So this is why people like Alpine,

91
00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:15.797
it feels like it's just getting
a bunch of storage savings for

92
00:06:15.797 --> 00:06:20.597
free, it's why,
even though I'm telling you to not focus

93
00:06:20.597 --> 00:06:24.637
too much on this stuff,
you might as well do this.

94
00:06:24.637 --> 00:06:30.243
And like I said, I use it all the time,
because it is so easy to use,

95
00:06:30.243 --> 00:06:34.850
and it's, for the most part,
99 point five nines or

96
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:41.289
six nines percents of the time it is
exactly the same as running it in Debian.

97
00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.853
So yeah, I went from 1.1 gigs to 150,
just like that, super fast.

98
00:06:45.853 --> 00:06:49.258
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you have an example
of what we might be missing out on that

99
00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:49.819
one gig?

100
00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:54.119
I know we're very specifically
looking at node here, but

101
00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:58.609
is there, like, why do we even
need the gig on the first one?

102
00:06:58.609 --> 00:07:01.707
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, it's a good question,
like, why would you include the whole gig?

103
00:07:01.707 --> 00:07:05.708
It comes with everything that
Debian comes with, right?

104
00:07:05.708 --> 00:07:10.510
So you are gonna have the full registry of
everything you can get from app update.

105
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:18.034
You are gonna have a bunch of Linux
utilities for diagnosing memory leaks.

106
00:07:18.034 --> 00:07:21.972
There's a bunch of stuff in there
that you will just never use,

107
00:07:21.972 --> 00:07:25.111
because I don't even know what they are,
right?

108
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.217
Yeah, it's full Debian,
there's nothing taken out of it.

109
00:07:28.217 --> 00:07:30.411
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry.

110
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:31.394
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Man pages.

111
00:07:31.394 --> 00:07:33.405
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Man pages,
that's actually a fantastic,

112
00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:37.114
man pages is actually quite large, and
it includes all of the man pages, right?

113
00:07:37.114 --> 00:07:40.201
And if I would go in and say,
man, blah, it's gonna say,

114
00:07:40.201 --> 00:07:43.611
you have to download these before
I can know what to do with them.

115
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:48.176
So, man pages is actually a perfect
example of stuff that you would

116
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.691
need if you were interacting
with Linux as a human.

117
00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:57.174
But if you're just using it as a cattle
container to run Node applications,

118
00:07:57.174 --> 00:07:58.811
you would never need.

119
00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:00.076
Did that answer your question?

120
00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:05.019
Cool, so, that being said, and
we'll talk about it here in just a second,

121
00:08:05.019 --> 00:08:09.527
there is Debian-Slim which does
the same thing but stays in Debian.

122
00:08:09.527 --> 00:08:11.207
But we'll get there.

123
00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:14.571
So, when should you select Alpine?

124
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:18.267
This is a Brian Holt opinion,
not a general opinion,

125
00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:22.469
so definitely add all the caveats and
grains of salt on this.

126
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:25.899
Is that the Alpine is
the destination container.

127
00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:27.693
It's the last mile.

128
00:08:27.693 --> 00:08:31.126
It's the UPS of containers that it's
the actual one that goes the last mile and

129
00:08:31.126 --> 00:08:32.961
delivers whatever you're trying to do.

130
00:08:32.961 --> 00:08:35.440
Don't use it anywhere else in your tool
chain, that doesn't make any sense to me.

131
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.998
You would wanna use something that has all
of the utilities that you don't have to

132
00:08:39.998 --> 00:08:43.163
reinstall things or
think about reinstalling things.

133
00:08:43.163 --> 00:08:47.099
Just use all the full fat ones
until you get to the end, and

134
00:08:47.099 --> 00:08:50.887
then use Alpine to deliver
that to the last mile there.

135
00:08:50.887 --> 00:08:53.927
Yeah, generally I'll reach for
Debian, as you can see,

136
00:08:53.927 --> 00:08:58.459
almost everything uses Debian, so, peer
pressure continue with Debian as well, but

137
00:08:58.459 --> 00:09:00.587
Ubuntu is fine as well, about the same.

138
00:09:00.587 --> 00:09:03.752
I'm sure Red Hat is pulling their hair
out and saying, no, no, use Red Hat,

139
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.571
cuz they want you to
use Red Hat everywhere.

140
00:09:05.571 --> 00:09:09.010
I just haven't and don't,
so I continue to not.
