00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.494
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hello, and welcome to the
complete intro to containers version 2.

2
00:00:05.494 --> 00:00:10.444
And I'm Brian Holt, and
let's hop into the introduction here.

3
00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:16.882
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is a course
designed to teach you about containers and

4
00:00:16.882 --> 00:00:19.717
kind of to mystify what containers are.

5
00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:22.827
Describe how they can be
useful to you personally, and

6
00:00:22.827 --> 00:00:24.997
kind of in your programming journey.

7
00:00:24.997 --> 00:00:29.477
And just kinda walk through all
the steps of how to build a container,

8
00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:33.815
what's in a container, and
how they're gonna be useful for you.

9
00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:37.521
Containers are just getting more and
more important as the years go on.

10
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:41.712
I taught this course first 5 years ago,
and I made the prediction that containers

11
00:00:41.712 --> 00:00:44.641
would be just more important,
and turns out I was right.

12
00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:48.595
And I still think,
they got more ways to go.

13
00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:50.383
So who are you?

14
00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:53.311
This course is aimed at developers, so

15
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:57.935
all the examples here will be
driven by that kind of that fact.

16
00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:02.380
You don't necessarily need to
be a super in depth advanced

17
00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.474
developer to get a lot of use out of this.

18
00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:09.776
But I will say that some coding
experiences can be super helpful here.

19
00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:13.270
There's lots of cool courses on front
of masters like intro to web dev,

20
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.615
they'll teach you kind
of those basic skills.

21
00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:20.940
And then the other thing I'll say that
will be helpful is some Linux experience.

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.737
So a lot of this course is taught on
the command line and using Linux.

23
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:28.575
So I do have another course
called Complete Intro to Linux on

24
00:01:28.575 --> 00:01:29.492
the Command line.

25
00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:31.186
Also, and Fronted Masters,

26
00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:34.657
that's available if you need
a bit of a catch up right there.

27
00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:37.599
There is alot of tips and tricks there,

28
00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:42.337
I think everyone can benefit
a little from that course as well.

29
00:01:42.337 --> 00:01:48.737
We are on, just so you know,
container-v2.holt.courses,

30
00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:51.719
what you see here are my notes.

31
00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.352
So I have two computers here,
one has my notes upon it, so

32
00:01:55.352 --> 00:01:59.393
I'm literally reading off with
that one I'm teaching to you.

33
00:01:59.393 --> 00:02:01.420
This is all open sourses,
it's available for free.

34
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.909
So feel free to reference it after
the course or share it with your friends.

35
00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.777
That's all totally okay.

36
00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:11.819
As far as your computer that
you should probably be using

37
00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.603
during the course of this course is,
I'm on Mac OS.

38
00:02:15.603 --> 00:02:19.460
Everything that I'm teaching
today will work great on Mac OS.

39
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.180
This course has also been
tested on Windows, so

40
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.998
as long as you have Windows 11 or
10, this course should work.

41
00:02:25.998 --> 00:02:31.201
It used to matter if you had home or not
home, that's no longer important anymore.

42
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:33.485
Just make sure you're on 10 or 11.

43
00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:36.420
And then if you're on
Windows specifically,

44
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.215
please enable either WSL2 or VirtualBox.

45
00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:43.749
We'll talk more about that
here in a future section, but

46
00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.496
that's what you're gonna need.

47
00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:50.413
There is a bunch of project files for
this.

48
00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:51.436
You can refer to them here.

49
00:02:51.436 --> 00:02:53.975
I have a link there that
should take you to GitHub,

50
00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:56.753
which has all of the correct
project files for you, and

51
00:02:56.753 --> 00:03:01.001
they're all labeled just by what section
that we're talking about at the moment.

52
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.153
Container could use a lot of CPU and
memory.

53
00:03:03.153 --> 00:03:07.634
If you have a modern-ish, and I say
modern-ish, made after 2020, I don't know,

54
00:03:07.634 --> 00:03:11.818
here I'm stabbing in the dark, but
if your computer's been made after 2020,

55
00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:13.103
you're probably fine.

56
00:03:13.103 --> 00:03:16.352
Docker requires 4 gigs of RAM.

57
00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:19.039
Anything lower,
you're probably in trouble.

58
00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:24.404
But if you have 8 gigs of RAM, I think
this course is totally smooth sailing.

59
00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:29.132
Last thing I'll say is a lot of this
is downloading stuff off of Docker Hub.

60
00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:30.240
That can take a lot of bandwidth.

61
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.862
So if you're on metered bandwidth,
just be aware that you'll probably

62
00:03:34.862 --> 00:03:38.284
download over a gig during
the course of this course.

63
00:03:38.284 --> 00:03:40.149
Where to file issues.

64
00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:42.461
This course is open source.

65
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:46.963
So please, if you find any mistakes,
both either grammatical or technical,

66
00:03:46.963 --> 00:03:48.496
just open a pull request.

67
00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:51.107
Me and the Frontend Masters team are
pretty good about keeping an eye on that.

68
00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:58.151
So yeah, just open a pull request on
the repo, which you can see is here.

69
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:02.068
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Who am I?

70
00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:05.908
I'm that dashing gentleman
that you see there.

71
00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:07.548
My name is Brian Holt.

72
00:04:07.548 --> 00:04:12.265
I am the vice president of product
at a company called SQLite Cloud.

73
00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:16.094
Or sometimes I'll call it
SQLite Cloud because I'm lazy and

74
00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:21.455
I worked at Microsoft long enough where
they smash into my head that it said SQL.

75
00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:26.216
I love teaching that's why I keep coming
back to Frontend Masters over and over and

76
00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:27.465
over and over again.

77
00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:29.039
It really scratches just
an itch in my brain.

78
00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.235
And the other thing that I've
also discovered is just,

79
00:04:32.235 --> 00:04:35.842
teaching helps me understand
something more fundamentally.

80
00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:39.307
So it forces me to kind of peel back
all of my layers of knowledge and

81
00:04:39.307 --> 00:04:41.576
really get at the core of what's going on.

82
00:04:41.576 --> 00:04:45.982
I'm sure you all know the feeling of,
you understand how something works, but

83
00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:50.485
you've never really bothered to open the
box to figure out why it works that way.

84
00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:53.528
I like teaching because it
forces me to open the box.

85
00:04:53.528 --> 00:04:56.600
So I learned a ton in the process
of creating this course,

86
00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.064
even though this is the second
revision of this course, right?

87
00:05:00.064 --> 00:05:04.068
Yeah, so I work on a cloud
database at SQLite Cloud.

88
00:05:04.068 --> 00:05:09.441
And before that,
I used to work at Snowflake and Stripe and

89
00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:15.373
Microsoft as a product manager,
developer relations person.

90
00:05:15.373 --> 00:05:20.842
But previous to that,
I was a JavaScript engineer for a decade,

91
00:05:20.842 --> 00:05:25.511
at Linkedin, Netflix,
Reddit, a few other places.

92
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:29.439
So I've had a pretty wide varied career.

93
00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:33.536
And I've done everything
from design engineering.

94
00:05:33.536 --> 00:05:36.439
I did a lot of that at
Reddit in particular,

95
00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.487
all the way to very deep backend and
infrastructure stuff.

96
00:05:40.487 --> 00:05:44.699
I did a lot of that at LinkedIn,
and Microsoft in particular.

97
00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:48.018
And at Snowflake and at SQLite that I do
a lot of stuff with Kubernetes these days.

98
00:05:48.018 --> 00:05:54.806
So I've done everything in
terms of full stack there.

99
00:05:54.806 --> 00:05:57.673
Why containers, and
why learn containers from me?

100
00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:00.907
When I worked at Microsoft,
I worked on Azure.

101
00:06:00.907 --> 00:06:05.116
I was in charge of developer experience
for all JavaScript developers that worked

102
00:06:05.116 --> 00:06:09.143
with Azure, and so containers were
a really important part of that strategy.

103
00:06:09.143 --> 00:06:13.697
So I really dove deep into them to really
learn how they worked, and I was always

104
00:06:13.697 --> 00:06:17.713
surprised, this is less complicated
than I thought it was gonna be.

105
00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:21.844
And so that was part of my reason of
wanting to teach this course is to teach

106
00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:25.982
developers, particularly,
JavaScript-oriented developers, but

107
00:06:25.982 --> 00:06:29.776
any developer, really,
that this is a really powerful tool, and

108
00:06:29.776 --> 00:06:31.498
it's very understandable.

109
00:06:31.498 --> 00:06:37.513
So that's what got me inspired to teach
this course, and I hope you enjoy it.
