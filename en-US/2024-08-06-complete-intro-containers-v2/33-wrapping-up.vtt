00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.403
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Congratulations on
finishing a class on containers.

2
00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:07.261
You didn't know that you could spend
this much time thinking about three

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:10.688
different Linux tools duct-taped together,
but here we are.

4
00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:15.704
I mean, that's really my hope for you
taking this class, is kind of demystify

5
00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:20.113
what goes into a container,
why we have them, why they're useful.

6
00:00:20.113 --> 00:00:24.598
And just really how powerful those
three tools just kind of put together.

7
00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:27.011
We've built so many layers on top of it.

8
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:32.750
But at the end of the day, it really is,
we're talking about Linux jails,

9
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.953
namespaces and control groups, right?

10
00:00:35.953 --> 00:00:38.588
Everything on top of that is just
additional tooling that we put

11
00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:39.143
on top of it.

12
00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:43.843
So here's, I mean, this is basically
everything that we went into just

13
00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:48.635
kind of for as a rear point of review,
but you were here, so you know that.

14
00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:52.830
So I'm gonna say congrats,
most of you now are ahead of the curve and

15
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.172
containers, I would say most of
the developers in the industry don't

16
00:00:57.172 --> 00:01:00.571
understand the depth of containers here,
and you do.

17
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:04.166
I mean, I said this five years ago and
I was right that I think that containers

18
00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.997
are only gonna become more important in
our day to day development environment.

19
00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:12.241
People told me I was nuts that,
something else was gonna supersede that,

20
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:16.004
that Micro VMs was the future, and
a bunch of stuff like that, and

21
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.280
they were wrong, and I am still right.

22
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.897
And I still think that these are gonna
get just more and more important.

23
00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:25.658
If you're not using containers
in your day-to-day already,

24
00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:27.544
which I imagine many of you are.

25
00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:31.867
Then I imagine, within the next couple
of years, either at your current job or

26
00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:35.877
your next job, you probably will be
using containers in some capacity.

27
00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:39.064
And I'll also say that anytime
you open your phone or

28
00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:43.781
get on the Internet, you're interacting
with a container in some variety.

29
00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:47.084
Because I would definitely
say that every Fortune

30
00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:51.497
500 company has containers
somewhere in their stack, right?

31
00:01:51.497 --> 00:01:56.976
So they're just everywhere, and
they're becoming even more places.

32
00:01:56.976 --> 00:02:00.026
I use containers for stuff like,
I run my home assistant at home,

33
00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:03.866
like I have a couple of Raspberry Pis that
are just spread out throughout my house.

34
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:07.815
And it was literally easier for
me to just use Kubernetes because now

35
00:02:07.815 --> 00:02:11.915
I can just manage all the container
images and just send them that way.

36
00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:16.911
Which ended up being like a really cool
workflow and a fun way to apply this,

37
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:18.510
all this stuff as well.

38
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.389
Yeah, and I only see this like,
you see Kubernetes on in fridges,

39
00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.529
you see them on watches,
you see them in billboards.

40
00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.662
I think you're just gonna
continue seeing them everywhere.

41
00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:33.858
I think it's StackBlitz, so
it's using now web containers, right?

42
00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:36.918
So you can actually ship containers
to clients using WebAssembly,

43
00:02:36.918 --> 00:02:38.266
which is really cool as well.

44
00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:42.439
Thanks for sticking with me, please
let me know how you like the course.

45
00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.970
I left my link down here,
you can go ahead and tweet at me.

46
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.419
Or star the course on GitHub,
that always makes me feel good.

47
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.290
And yeah, thanks for sticking around.

48
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.738
