WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.728
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that means that we
have kubectl, it's installed, and

2
00:00:03.728 --> 00:00:08.280
it is ready to interact with our
Kubernetes cluster, which is great.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.220
Now, we just have to give it
some configuration to work with.

4
00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.870
As you might imagine, something like this
requires a lot of configuration, right?

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.069
Because there isn't something that Kubernetes
can assume about your cluster,

6
00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.663
you have to basically be very,
very explicit.

7
00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:30.791
I don't write Kubernetes
configurations on the regular I leave

8
00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:35.143
that to my DevOps team, and
I'm not a DevOps person.

9
00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:39.768
So there is a very cool project that we're
gonna look at today that's made to get

10
00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.058
developers Started with Kubernetes.

11
00:00:42.058 --> 00:00:44.218
It's called kompose with a K.

12
00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:52.492
It's an official project directly
from the cloud native foundation.

13
00:00:52.492 --> 00:00:56.388
So you can see here it's actually directly
on the Kubernetes organization itself.

14
00:00:56.388 --> 00:01:00.002
So it's a supported thing,
it's been around for years.

15
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:04.153
We're gonna use that and
it takes a Docker Compose YAML file and

16
00:01:04.153 --> 00:01:07.297
it turns that into
Kubernetes configuration.

17
00:01:07.297 --> 00:01:12.787
So it's meant to be, you get a bunch of
stuff working, you're satisfied with it,

18
00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:18.208
now you wanna get it on Kubernetes,
Kompose is meant to be that first step.

19
00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:21.188
So it's purely just It takes
this configuration and

20
00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:24.814
translates it into this
other configuration.

21
00:01:24.814 --> 00:01:27.514
It's like a one step thing you're
not gonna use Kompose over and

22
00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:28.824
over and over again.

23
00:01:28.824 --> 00:01:32.527
At this point you're supposed
to like switch over to then,

24
00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:34.906
maintaining your Kubernetes files.

25
00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:38.744
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're just
gonna use the same product here.

26
00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:41.673
We're gonna make a couple
minor modifications, just so

27
00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:43.513
that we can get some better output.

28
00:01:45.473 --> 00:01:51.870
So first one is yeah,
we're just in this the same project here,

29
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.513
Docker Compose, and I'm gonna say,
links, db, that's fine.

30
00:01:58.513 --> 00:02:00.976
We're gonna also add a, depends on.

31
00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:07.836
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Db, this is just being more
explicit to Kubernetes to say hey, this

32
00:02:07.836 --> 00:02:13.163
cannot start until this other thing starts
because Kubernetes is very particular.

33
00:02:13.163 --> 00:02:18.033
It's okay, I'm gonna start this thing
first and then I'll start this thing.

34
00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:19.503
So that's good, we want that.

35
00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:26.162
There's also this thing called
labels that, if you give stuff

36
00:02:26.162 --> 00:02:31.292
labels in your Docker Compose things and
then you deploy that it'll

37
00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:37.192
show you all the labels so
it can kind of help you find those things.

38
00:02:37.192 --> 00:02:39.768
And it's also just useful for
things like traffic, right?

39
00:02:39.768 --> 00:02:44.598
And traffic's another ingress server
we're not doing traffic, so no thank you.

40
00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:51.351
But we're gonna say
kompose.service.type and

41
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.410
there's a node port.

42
00:02:57.498 --> 00:03:01.501
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is basically
saying, I'm gonna run all of this stuff.

43
00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:04.078
And then the way that I want
you to expose it to the rest

44
00:03:04.078 --> 00:03:05.901
of my cluster is on through one port.

45
00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:08.271
So it's basically gonna do some
load balancing internally for you.

46
00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:10.480
And then the other thing
that we're gonna do,

47
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.107
because this is all being developed
locally and we have not published this,

48
00:03:14.107 --> 00:03:16.671
typically Kubernetes wants
to pull from a registry.

49
00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:18.171
It doesn't wanna pull
from your local computer.

50
00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:20.165
I think that makes sense, right?

51
00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:26.836
We're gonna say, kompose.service, no,
not service, image, pull, policy.

52
00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:34.219
And you can do if not present, that's not
what you really want. What you really want is actually never,

53
00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:38.392
because I haven't published this anywhere,

54
00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:43.261
so please don't try and
pull it from anywhere.

55
00:03:43.261 --> 00:03:46.731
We have to be more specific about
ports here, you can't just assume.

56
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:53.911
So, that's all that we're doing there.

57
00:03:55.341 --> 00:03:59.781
And then web, build web links.

58
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:03.494
This one we have to do,
we do have to link it to the API.

59
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.995
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we also have to say depends on API, and

60
00:04:09.995 --> 00:04:14.016
then we have to give it
some labels as well.

61
00:04:19.851 --> 00:04:27.397
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
this is gonna be kompose.service.type.

62
00:04:27.397 --> 00:04:30.202
And we want this to be a load balancer,

63
00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:34.667
because ultimately that's
what nginx is really good at.

64
00:04:34.667 --> 00:04:37.147
It does load balancing very well.

65
00:04:37.147 --> 00:04:41.418
Load balancer is really just
a special type of node port, but

66
00:04:41.418 --> 00:04:45.690
what this is signifying to like
whenever you go to deploy this

67
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.129
to Azure Aks it's gonna instead
of making this a node port it's

68
00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.262
gonna make it into azure front door for
you.

69
00:04:53.262 --> 00:04:56.465
So it's actually a signal to whatever
cloud provider that you're providing is

70
00:04:56.465 --> 00:04:59.425
like hey actually want you to take over
here and do all my load balancing for

71
00:04:59.425 --> 00:04:59.928
me, okay.

72
00:04:59.928 --> 00:05:04.903
So locally this will just be running nginx
very likely in production it'll be done

73
00:05:04.903 --> 00:05:09.028
by front door or whatever when you
are or Traefik or something like that.

74
00:05:11.097 --> 00:05:17.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Kompose service.expose and
the answer is true.

75
00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:22.612
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because this is actually a
service that we want to be made available

76
00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:23.185
publicly.

77
00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:29.855
And then, again,
this is built, yeah, exactly.

78
00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:34.789
Kompose, image pull policy, never,
right, because this is built locally so

79
00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:36.125
don't expose that.

80
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:39.395
Again, I have a copy of this if you didn't
really feel like copying all that down.

81
00:05:40.828 --> 00:05:43.138
We go back here,
links to the project here.

82
00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:47.895
I have a Kubernetes directory here with
all of this stuff already done, but

83
00:05:47.895 --> 00:05:50.868
specifically the Docker Compose part here.

84
00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:53.618
This should all be the same of
what you and I just did together.

85
00:05:53.618 --> 00:05:55.169
So now that we've done all of that,

86
00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.222
I think actually what I'm gonna do
here is because I did make some minor

87
00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:01.640
modifications to make all this
stuff work well to get Together.

88
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:08.660
So if you look here, like the Docker file,
I actually did give it its own nginx-conf.

89
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.524
Rather than run this directly from the
project that we were just in, I'm going

90
00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:18.180
to go back to my desktop, and I'm just
gonna copy that same directory in.

91
00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.701
So from /personal
/containers-projects/Kubernetes,

92
00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:28.345
I'm just gonna copy that to here.

93
00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:34.120
So if I go into that directory,

94
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.055
kubernetes, and see here.

95
00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:43.236
And you don't have to do this, but
I'm just gonna remove *.yaml.

96
00:06:47.268 --> 00:06:50.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now I have as my Docker
Compose file, and if you look at that

97
00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:55.945
Docker Compose file, it's exactly what
you and I just wrote together, right?

98
00:06:59.081 --> 00:07:01.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, cool.

99
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.739
Yeah, let's just look at minorly just
quickly what I ended up changing for

100
00:07:06.739 --> 00:07:10.444
this because I'm sure
that's of interest to you,

101
00:07:10.444 --> 00:07:14.940
relatively the same projects
that I now have an nginx.conf.

102
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.030
This was just to handle all
ingressive traffic, right.

103
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.438
So now that you don't have a separately
exposed API service,

104
00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:28.982
it's all just being routed through nginx,
which is what this location API does.

105
00:07:32.392 --> 00:07:34.742
Everything else is exactly
what you expect it to be.

106
00:07:36.012 --> 00:07:39.721
And then the only thing I did here,
I think actually,

107
00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:43.760
I think I only did it here inside
of the source directory is I

108
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.565
modified the API to read from
the correct area as well.

109
00:07:49.895 --> 00:07:51.165
Okay, cool.

110
00:07:53.085 --> 00:07:57.582
So what we're gonna do, is we're
gonna say Kompose, which by the way,

111
00:07:57.582 --> 00:08:02.102
I think you just say brew installed
Kompose as well if I'm not mistaken.

112
00:08:04.242 --> 00:08:07.705
But I already have it installed so

113
00:08:07.705 --> 00:08:13.402
I'm gonna say Kompose convert
dash dash build local.

114
00:08:20.114 --> 00:08:21.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This will take
I'll take my Docker Compose file,

115
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.838
which it'll find automatically, right,
because it's called the right thing.

116
00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:28.740
And if I go into my project now,

117
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:33.438
you'll see that I have
a bunch of YAML files here.

118
00:08:36.788 --> 00:08:40.666
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That have a bunch of
configurations that you'll see some

119
00:08:40.666 --> 00:08:45.204
of the stuff that came in
here from Kompose, right?

120
00:08:45.204 --> 00:08:50.105
But generally, this is pretty just
vanilla Kubernetes kinda stuff.

121
00:08:52.804 --> 00:08:55.824
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we have a service and
a deployment for each one of them.

122
00:08:55.824 --> 00:08:57.869
The service describes
the service itself and

123
00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:01.432
the deployment describes how are you going
to deploy this when we go to deploy.

124
00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:04.333
Now that we have all of these
configuration files, generally,

125
00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:07.071
what you would do at this point,
if you were happy with it is,

126
00:09:07.071 --> 00:09:10.206
you would just delete your Docker
compose or move it somewhere else.

127
00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:15.550
I have intentionally cheated
a little bit so that,

128
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:20.155
as you might guess .yaml and
.yml the same thing, but

129
00:09:20.155 --> 00:09:25.961
I intentionally named them a little
bit differently so that I can do,

130
00:09:25.961 --> 00:09:31.968
cube control, apply -f for files,
quote, the quote's important so

131
00:09:31.968 --> 00:09:37.330
make sure you please put the quote
in there, *.yaml.

132
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:41.684
You can't apply Docker Compose, that's
why I have different file extensions for

133
00:09:41.684 --> 00:09:45.626
both of them, and I'm gonna try and
get this up and running on Kubernetes.

134
00:09:45.626 --> 00:09:50.580
API created, created, created, yeah.

135
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:55.986
Looks like, I say Docker ps I should
be able to see everything running so

136
00:09:55.986 --> 00:10:00.683
I can see Kubernetes db Kubernetes api,
and Kubernetes web.

137
00:10:01.743 --> 00:10:08.325
Okay, and now I should be
able to say localhost:8080.

138
00:10:08.325 --> 00:10:09.503
Is that what I was supposed to do here?

139
00:10:10.593 --> 00:10:13.677
This gets a lot more difficult to debug
because it's all kind of in various

140
00:10:13.677 --> 00:10:15.273
different places, right?

141
00:10:15.273 --> 00:10:19.986
So yeah, here we can do kubectl get all.

142
00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:22.216
And kinda get the bird's eye
view here of what's happening.

143
00:10:23.816 --> 00:10:26.266
So this is running, cool.

144
00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:32.396
Which is the api, the db, and
the web, that's all running.

145
00:10:32.396 --> 00:10:35.547
You can see all the ports
that are being exposed here.

146
00:10:35.547 --> 00:10:39.084
8080, 27017, yeah, and

147
00:10:39.084 --> 00:10:45.386
then I don't expose the API
that's why that's not working.

148
00:10:45.386 --> 00:10:50.782
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It should be on 8081,
which it is.

149
00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:55.071
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I might not have gotten the,

150
00:10:58.088 --> 00:10:59.084
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is working,

151
00:10:59.084 --> 00:11:00.620
getting a 200 okay.

152
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.950
Why is that get not giving what I expect?

153
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.690
it is it's just taking a second.

154
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:12.478
Okay, so everything's working except this
is all now running on Kubernetes, right?

155
00:11:12.478 --> 00:11:13.954
Pretty cool.

156
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.299
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can see the node
port, load balancer, cluster IP just means

157
00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:24.440
that like it's not a node port,
right, it's just a cluster of IPs.

158
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.130
The deployment is ready, so
you can roll forward and roll backwards.

159
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.478
it's all the magic of Kubernetes.

160
00:11:30.478 --> 00:11:37.715
Get info or
what was the other two command,

161
00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:42.949
I can't remember what it was.

162
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:44.161
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Show?

163
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:47.213
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is it show info,
cluster info there it is.

164
00:11:47.213 --> 00:11:54.383
That's what I want kubectrl cluster-info.

165
00:11:56.164 --> 00:11:59.354
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Some of the stuff you can
actually view directly in your browser,

166
00:11:59.354 --> 00:12:01.501
it'll actually give you some dashboards.

167
00:12:01.501 --> 00:12:03.341
Yeah, let's find that.

168
00:12:03.341 --> 00:12:09.811
Advanced, that's fine,
except there is some continue, okay.

169
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:11.613
I don't have it set up correctly.

170
00:12:13.881 --> 00:12:15.447
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But there's a bunch
of stuff you can actually be

171
00:12:15.447 --> 00:12:16.201
able to pull out of it.

172
00:12:17.911 --> 00:12:21.245
Yeah, it's got core DNS, so it's actually,
like, running its own DNS for

173
00:12:21.245 --> 00:12:22.235
you inside of itself.

174
00:12:23.265 --> 00:12:26.855
I'm sure dump would just
be a bunch of stuff.

175
00:12:26.855 --> 00:12:29.420
Yeah, it's a ton of stuff
that comes out of this, but

176
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.105
you can see this is all the logs
that are coming out of it.

177
00:12:34.185 --> 00:12:35.455
Tons of very cool stuff here.

178
00:12:36.635 --> 00:12:41.657
Things like rancher have a, which is
like something on top of Kubernetes,

179
00:12:41.657 --> 00:12:45.736
give you really nice dashboards,
which are also very cool.
