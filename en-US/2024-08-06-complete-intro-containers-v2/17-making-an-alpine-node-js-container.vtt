00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's make our
own node Alpine container.

2
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.017
So let's look at our benchmark,
what did I have here?

3
00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:14.070
Someone remember this, 143 megabytes.

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.010
But how low can you go?

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.490
Can we limbo with our containers and
do exactly what I told you not to do,

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.418
because it is fun?

7
00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.669
Okay.

8
00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:27.793
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's just go ahead and
keep building this project,

9
00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:29.558
totally fine here.

10
00:00:29.558 --> 00:00:33.840
We're gonna start from alpine,
what did I say,

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.779
3.19,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is, yep,

12
00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:40.049
that's the latest one.

13
00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:45.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The first thing that we're
gonna have to do is Alpine, like I said,

14
00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:47.022
includes nothing.

15
00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:51.509
So we're gonna have to go ahead and
add RUN apk's

16
00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:56.677
Alpine package manager,
something of that nature.

17
00:00:56.677 --> 00:01:00.312
It's their apt get, essentially, add.

18
00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:07.022
We're gonna say --update node.js and
npm, okay?

19
00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:10.722
So now we will have node and npm.

20
00:01:11.992 --> 00:01:15.903
You can do this from latest as
well if you're feeling brave,

21
00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:18.985
I'm just gonna keep it on 3.19.

22
00:01:18.985 --> 00:01:20.971
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we've now added that.

23
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.561
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that really should be
enough for now, do I need to add a user?

24
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.839
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, no,
I think we will here in just a second,

25
00:01:39.839 --> 00:01:42.695
but let's go ahead and save that for now.

26
00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:50.299
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we will call this my-alpine, just so

27
00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.797
we can see a difference that we go here.

28
00:01:52.797 --> 00:01:55.961
Or maybe we'll call this alpine2.

29
00:01:59.553 --> 00:02:02.225
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, no,
except we have to build first, not that.

30
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.754
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Build, and
we're gonna call this alpine2.

31
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I not save this?

32
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.127
I did not save that, otherwise I was like
that's not doing what I want it to do.

33
00:02:27.268 --> 00:02:30.102
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so here's my problem.

34
00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:36.316
I was trying to run everything as this
user node, but remember that it's

35
00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:40.608
the node.js container that includes
that node user for us, right?

36
00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:45.203
If we don't have that existing, it's gonna
be, I don't know who node is, I can't, and

37
00:02:45.203 --> 00:02:47.148
it won't create it for you on the fly.

38
00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:52.398
So we could have to do this.

39
00:02:52.398 --> 00:02:59.883
I'm gonna say RUN addgroup, man,
I feel like this is taking my thunder,

40
00:02:59.883 --> 00:03:04.132
cuz that's literally what I wanna type.

41
00:03:04.132 --> 00:03:09.255
But you can't tell me what to do Github,
okay, -G node.

42
00:03:11.317 --> 00:03:13.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is going
to add a node user and

43
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.189
then it's gonna add a group
called node as well.

44
00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.477
So node to node we're just kind of
matching exactly what the node container

45
00:03:20.477 --> 00:03:21.576
has built into it.

46
00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:25.953
I would even say, why do they name them
the same thing that's actually kind of

47
00:03:25.953 --> 00:03:27.276
annoying to me, but who cares?

48
00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:28.696
It's what they do so we're sticking to it.

49
00:03:30.296 --> 00:03:35.096
You might ask me here, why wouldn't
we just have two run commands here?

50
00:03:35.096 --> 00:03:40.175
Cuz we want it to be in one layer,
that's that's usually the thing that is.

51
00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:43.614
It's fine that you would
have two layers there, but

52
00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:47.850
I like it that this is kind of
doing one thing conceptually to me.

53
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.880
So I like putting it all into one layer.

54
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.184
All right, so
we're gonna try that again, and

55
00:03:54.184 --> 00:03:59.055
now because that node user exists
up here wherever that is, this one,

56
00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:02.805
now this is actually able to finish,
all right?

57
00:04:02.805 --> 00:04:08.062
So we built it, can we run it?

58
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:19.055
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Localhost 8080 and
it's working, cool.

59
00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:23.719
And now we can see this is in use,
more complicated, alpine2.

60
00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:30.683
We went from 142.98 MB to 82 MB.

61
00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:34.941
So I don't know what we cut out,
I'll be super honest with you, but

62
00:04:34.941 --> 00:04:36.974
we cut out 60 MB of something.

63
00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:42.634
And that made us a much smaller container.

64
00:04:43.664 --> 00:04:48.434
Now question we should really be
asking ourselves if you were seriously

65
00:04:48.434 --> 00:04:52.806
considering shipping this to
production is, what did the node or

66
00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:57.984
the docker people feel was so important
to add 60 more MB to this container?

67
00:04:57.984 --> 00:05:01.528
In the grand scheme of things,
60 MB is nothing right?

68
00:05:01.528 --> 00:05:04.678
900 MB, I'm gonna say is something, right?

69
00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:09.088
So I agree with the the motion
to get to alpine.

70
00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:13.853
But I would be really cautious of somebody
thought it was important that 60 more

71
00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:17.128
megs, why am I messing with this, right?

72
00:05:17.128 --> 00:05:20.485
Hopefully you kind of get my
hesitancy there, so pretty cool.

73
00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:24.371
I've noticed that over the years as
this has been growing, I think when I

74
00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:28.465
previously taught this course,
I think it was like 40 MB instead of 80.

75
00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:33.525
So even that base alpine container
continues to grow a little bit over time.

76
00:05:33.525 --> 00:05:37.265
It's interesting that looking here
at my notes, I had 89 MB last week.

77
00:05:38.465 --> 00:05:41.418
And today you can see here it's 82 MB.

78
00:05:42.768 --> 00:05:45.098
You can see they are changing
these things all of the time.

79
00:05:46.948 --> 00:05:49.831
Which is great, because I mean someone's
caring about your security, right?

80
00:05:49.831 --> 00:05:53.409
Which is good that you don't
have to do that, as much.
