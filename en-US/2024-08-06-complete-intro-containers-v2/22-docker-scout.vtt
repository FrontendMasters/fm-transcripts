00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.269
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So one thing I wanted
to show you before we get even further

2
00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:03.951
into this and

3
00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:07.986
before we get into even docker features
is this was a feature I was playing with

4
00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:11.618
yesterday that I kind of wanted to
just explore with you a little bit.

5
00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:13.243
If I go into my command line here,

6
00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:16.620
there's a feature of Docker that I
haven't really used a whole lot.

7
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.126
So feel free to explore
a little bit more than me.

8
00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:22.437
It's called scout, That allows you
to inspect your containers for

9
00:00:22.437 --> 00:00:26.673
vulnerabilities, for
anything that Dockers identifies, hey,

10
00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:29.561
this part of your
container is problematic.

11
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:31.337
There's a feature called quick view, and

12
00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:33.120
you can just put
a container name in there.

13
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.085
So let's just look at the Alpine
container that we've been looking at,

14
00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:40.012
cuz I noticed it had some
security vulnerabilities.

15
00:00:40.012 --> 00:00:44.305
So it's just It's gonna do
a really quick scan of it, and

16
00:00:44.305 --> 00:00:47.972
it's gonna say, hey,
we actually found four,

17
00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:52.900
I think this is medium vulnerabilities
in your container there.

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.456
So then you can copy and paste this, CVEs,
if you're not familiar with the term CVE,

19
00:00:57.456 --> 00:01:01.853
I don't even remember what it stands for,
but it's a published vulnerability.

20
00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:05.854
It's a process for
publishing big vulnerabilities.

21
00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:07.540
So like when Microsoft had,

22
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.622
like the heart bleed that was
published as a CVE for example, right?

23
00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:12.420
It's for stuff like that.

24
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.991
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if we do that,
CVEs for alpine 3.9 point one,

25
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:23.054
we'll get a bit more in depth information.

26
00:01:23.054 --> 00:01:26.420
You can see we have four
vulnerabilities here.

27
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.283
It looks like there's 6 total,
that's interesting 2 are unspecified.

28
00:01:30.283 --> 00:01:32.696
Looks like there's 2 here.

29
00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:34.976
And you can like click into these and
see what they are.

30
00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:37.624
Also 2 of them are coming from open SSL.

31
00:01:37.624 --> 00:01:41.192
And then these medium CVE
are all coming from busy box.

32
00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:42.434
We talked a little bit about that before.

33
00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:48.377
That busy box is just
what underpins Alpine.

34
00:01:48.377 --> 00:01:50.235
So I thought that was kinda cool.

35
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.213
It's a feature that
wasn't there previously.

36
00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:56.595
I looked in the GUI,
it's also in there as well.

37
00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:59.431
So if we go into here,
where was one of our Alpine ones?

38
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:00.764
This one, okay?

39
00:02:00.764 --> 00:02:04.793
So this is one that we built,
Alpine 3, for a more complicated app.

40
00:02:04.793 --> 00:02:06.506
You can see all of these
are still showing up here.

41
00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:10.864
It'll show you the layers that
are problematic, which is cool.

42
00:02:10.864 --> 00:02:15.983
You can actually even go up into this and
you can see what's going on there.

43
00:02:15.983 --> 00:02:18.596
It'll show you all the packages
that are installed here,

44
00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:19.992
which is kind of interesting.

45
00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:23.396
And all the official images that
we're building off of here.

46
00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:27.789
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Recommended fixes.

47
00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.598
That's cool,
I recommend fixes for base image.

48
00:02:31.598 --> 00:02:35.126
So they're just telling us to,
I'll just pull a new one.

49
00:02:35.126 --> 00:02:38.479
Okay, cool, interesting.

50
00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.255
Or change the base image.

51
00:02:39.255 --> 00:02:45.007
Yeah, they're saying, yeah,
probably change this to 320, right?

52
00:02:45.007 --> 00:02:48.812
And you can see this was actually
published within the past 20 hours, right?

53
00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:55.085
So, since we started the course,
it's kind of interesting, cool.

54
00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:57.409
So that is Docker Scout,
pretty cool stuff.

55
00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.745
There's more to it,
I think it's just their tool for

56
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.791
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Keeping things secure.

57
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.668
There's other things in here that I
haven't really played around with, but

58
00:03:09.668 --> 00:03:11.404
I invite you to go check it out and
play with it.
