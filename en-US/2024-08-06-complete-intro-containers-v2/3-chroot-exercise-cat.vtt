00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.661
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So as an exercise,
just to kind of prove that you can,

2
00:00:05.661 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm gonna say, why don't you go do cat?

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.144
And make that work for yourself,

4
00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:15.769
and then you can actually read your secret
file inside of your rooted directory.

5
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:26.040
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's do cat, so
the first thing we're gonna do is

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.887
we're gonna copy slash bin slash
cat into my new root slash

7
00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:36.921
bin core we're gonna say
LDD slash bin slash cat.

8
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:45.831
And looks we just have these two so

9
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:51.609
we're gonna say copy blah,

10
00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.996
copy blah into.

11
00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:59.893
That's gonna go into my new route / lib,
okay?

12
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:04.051
So now we're gonna change route root,

13
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.713
into my new root and
we're gonna run bash and

14
00:01:08.713 --> 00:01:15.895
we're gonna say cat secret txt and
it says, my super secret thing.

15
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.236
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's pwd work it does, okay
so you can see here, according to this

16
00:01:24.236 --> 00:01:29.990
process, it thinks that it's in its
root directory, which is wild, right?

17
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.476
It's not, right, it's in my new
whatever I called it, my new root.

18
00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:40.264
So, you could call this process that
we're in right now jailed, right?

19
00:01:40.264 --> 00:01:42.790
It cannot see outside of
the directory that it's in right now.

20
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.046
So, if you had Coca-Cola and Pepsi running
next to each other on the same server and

21
00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:52.777
you jailed both of their processes,
no matter what, they're not gonna be

22
00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:57.690
able to at least use the file system
to navigate to the other one, right.

23
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.934
And you can imagine that they're not
privileged that they can't just exit

24
00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:04.384
out of their jail, right, that you just
dump them into the jailed process, and

25
00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:06.658
you don't tell them you're
in a jailed process.

26
00:02:06.658 --> 00:02:11.630
So, the first step is
locking down the file system,

27
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.458
for us building containers.

28
00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:16.855
One question you might ask me is,

29
00:02:16.855 --> 00:02:22.604
is there a less burdensome way than having
to manually copy everything by hand?

30
00:02:22.604 --> 00:02:27.079
To get a new bare metal instance
of a Linux distribution, and

31
00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.430
the answer is there is, and we're
gonna show you shortly how to do that,

32
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.721
but the difference is this one I'm just
literally just copying stuff over.

33
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.781
The shortcut I'm gonna show you,
it's gonna download about 150

34
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:47.471
megabytes worth of stuff cuz it's gonna
download a brand-new copy of Debian,

35
00:02:47.471 --> 00:02:52.117
which is on one hand, it's one command,
so it's less burdensome.

36
00:02:52.117 --> 00:02:55.456
On the other hand,
it takes a minute or two to do so, so

37
00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:58.527
you're gonna have to
weigh your options there.

38
00:02:58.527 --> 00:02:59.647
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Question.

39
00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:00.405
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So,

40
00:03:00.405 --> 00:03:02.975
whenever you create
something like this and

41
00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:06.934
you have to replicate the same
structure that the binary in this case

42
00:03:06.934 --> 00:03:09.678
requires, otherwise,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It won't know where to find

43
00:03:09.678 --> 00:03:10.599
them- [INAUDIBLE].

44
00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.591
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, exactly,
that's why the paths are important.

45
00:03:13.591 --> 00:03:17.330
And you'll notice here that
I had you put in a lib 64,

46
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.828
sometimes there will be
64 libraries there, and

47
00:03:20.828 --> 00:03:25.809
you can just tell by this is lib,
it'll say lib 64 here instead of lib.

48
00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.513
For whatever reason this particular,
I actually don't know why it changes from

49
00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:36.400
time-to-time, but in this particular case,
we didn't have anything to copy to the lib

50
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.200
64 directory, but
sometimes you will, right?
