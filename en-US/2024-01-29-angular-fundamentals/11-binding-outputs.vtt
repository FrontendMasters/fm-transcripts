WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929
So now,
we've done all the way up to step 4, and

2
00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:05.220
we kinda did them together one by one.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.519
So we added our click listener,
we added our handle Save.

4
00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.841
Now we've implemented car saved but
we emitted the car property.

5
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:13.912
So we got that cooking.

6
00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:18.577
Now, in app component,
we gotta bind it to a car saved event.

7
00:00:18.577 --> 00:00:20.562
How do I know that that's
what I have to bind to?

8
00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.126
How do I know that?

9
00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.590
It's because that's the name.

10
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.114
So when you have this output right here,

11
00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:29.243
you see this little part
on line 45 on my screen?

12
00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:30.904
See, I have this output.

13
00:00:30.904 --> 00:00:34.360
And when I put that output there,
whatever is directed to the right of that,

14
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.818
that's gonna be the name of the event for
the output that you can reference.

15
00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:38.904
That is the name of it.

16
00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:41.318
So that's how you can always be certain,
okay?

17
00:00:41.318 --> 00:00:43.443
How do I know what
the name of the input is?

18
00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.362
It's the same rule.

19
00:00:44.362 --> 00:00:47.677
So it's car, because here's
where I define the input, and

20
00:00:47.677 --> 00:00:49.433
what's right next to it is car.

21
00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:52.934
So now we have the carSaved output.

22
00:00:52.934 --> 00:00:55.483
So now we gotta bind to it,
so let's bind to it.

23
00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:56.392
Where do we bind to it?

24
00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:58.251
Where did we say we gotta do that at?

25
00:00:58.251 --> 00:00:59.777
We gotta bind to it.

26
00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:03.831
Let's see, [INAUDIBLE] value.

27
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:06.591
On the listening property, duh, okay.

28
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:12.714
So now, Man, this is cool.

29
00:01:12.714 --> 00:01:15.673
You saw I just typed that parenthesis,
it's showing me everything I need to type.

30
00:01:15.673 --> 00:01:16.883
Isn't that something?

31
00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:18.063
Isn't that something?

32
00:01:18.063 --> 00:01:19.662
That's special.

33
00:01:19.662 --> 00:01:21.651
Tell you, Angular team, we care about you.

34
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:23.400
All right, and
we wanna assign it this value.

35
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.560
I already gave you this value.

36
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.580
Wow, man, I must really care about y'all.

37
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.270
I gave y'all all the juice, look at that.

38
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.955
So now we got everything that we need,
except for what?

39
00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:34.536
What's the last step?

40
00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:35.294
&gt;&gt; Gotta implement that.

41
00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:37.190
&gt;&gt; Gotta implement that, that's right.

42
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.383
And I love to hear from you all,
you know why?

43
00:01:39.383 --> 00:01:41.814
Cuz it lets me know that
you're more comfortable and

44
00:01:41.814 --> 00:01:45.306
that you really do believe that I'm
not gonna ask you any trick questions.

45
00:01:45.306 --> 00:01:46.066
So here we go.

46
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:48.936
So I wanna collapse that carList.

47
00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:50.056
I wanna implement this.

48
00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:53.986
It takes something.

49
00:01:53.986 --> 00:01:55.625
What does this accept?

50
00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.297
This is a harder one,
it's not a trick question,

51
00:01:58.297 --> 00:02:00.409
it's just a little bit harder, okay?

52
00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.276
Let's walk through the path.

53
00:02:02.276 --> 00:02:05.507
The output emits what?

54
00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:06.816
Let's walk through it.

55
00:02:08.037 --> 00:02:09.706
What does the output emit?

56
00:02:12.723 --> 00:02:13.422
&gt;&gt; The car.

57
00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:14.072
&gt;&gt; The car.

58
00:02:14.072 --> 00:02:16.281
What type is the car?

59
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:17.151
&gt;&gt; Car.

60
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:18.961
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's a type car.

61
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:25.459
So when this is emitted,
I can expect this event to be a car.

62
00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:33.439
Okay, I know that was a little tricky,
not tricky, that's the wrong word,

63
00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.892
that one's a little difficult to
grock a little bit, but I get you.

64
00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:42.167
So we can do this, we can say,
well, the car of type car.

65
00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:50.697
When I get it, the last thing I need to do
is just add it to my savedCarList.push.

66
00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:53.971
But how do I know it can
actually go in that list?

67
00:02:53.971 --> 00:02:55.355
How can I confirm?

68
00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:56.505
What can I do?

69
00:02:56.505 --> 00:03:01.030
I can look at the definition and
see that it is an array of type car.

70
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.982
See, the types help you along the way.

71
00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:08.390
When I try to talk about this to people,
like the thing about this event.

72
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.792
Anyone ever seen the small child's toy
that has a block with cut out shapes?

73
00:03:14.792 --> 00:03:16.522
Okay, this is that.

74
00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:20.466
Because if I grab one of
the shapes from the ground,

75
00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:23.138
I can only fit it where it matches.

76
00:03:23.138 --> 00:03:26.736
I can only put it into
that box where it matches.

77
00:03:26.736 --> 00:03:30.648
So here,
only a car can go into this function.

78
00:03:30.648 --> 00:03:33.944
If I try to send a string, or
if I try to put a circle, I'm sorry,

79
00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:36.827
a square into a round peg,
it's not going to accept it.

80
00:03:36.827 --> 00:03:40.506
Same thing with our type system
in Angular, like with TypeScript.

81
00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.556
It only will accept a car.

82
00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:46.477
If I put a string, I mean, a string won't
work, a number won't work, gotta be a car.

83
00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:49.217
So it has to be the right shape,
the right shape.

84
00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:53.797
So now we can maintain that,
ooh, caps lock.

85
00:03:53.797 --> 00:03:57.062
We can maintain that whole
logic this whole way through.

86
00:03:57.062 --> 00:04:01.060
You see, so that even helps us all the way
through, because even our array, so

87
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.226
if I said this was just string array,
doesn't work anymore,

88
00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:09.866
Because a car is not a string.

89
00:04:11.114 --> 00:04:13.611
You see, so those types.

90
00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:17.080
So if I said this was a string,
let's just say, fine.

91
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:24.064
Now that works, but something else
is gonna be broken, you know why?

92
00:04:24.064 --> 00:04:27.797
Because I didn't say I was getting
a string from the emitted event,

93
00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:29.444
I told you I was getting a car.

94
00:04:34.489 --> 00:04:35.269
So there we go.

95
00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:40.149
So if the typing system has felt
kinda like, what's the point of it?

96
00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:43.076
Hopefully, this is helping
clarify all the value,

97
00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:47.479
because think about trying to track down
that error if you didn't have types.

98
00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.300
You were expecting an object but got
a string, that's complex to track down.

99
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.152
You spend a half a day and
then you're ready to go home and

100
00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:59.718
then you go take a shower, you're like,
the types are wrong, you know what I mean?

101
00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:03.405
Later on when your brain is, that's
when I get my best ideas, seriously,

102
00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:06.755
cuz during the day, I'd be like,
wow, too much stuff happening.

103
00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:09.529
All right, friends, we did it, we did it.

104
00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:11.036
How can we prove that we did it?

105
00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:15.930
&gt;&gt; Click a button.

106
00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.979
&gt;&gt; Click a button, that's right.

107
00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:21.301
Let's get this Disaccord,
[LAUGH] the Pocus Fjord.

108
00:05:21.301 --> 00:05:22.958
All right, how many cars we get?

109
00:05:22.958 --> 00:05:23.906
We got a lot of cars.

110
00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:25.586
Look at that.

111
00:05:25.586 --> 00:05:26.975
All right, we're doing great.

112
00:05:26.975 --> 00:05:30.151
We're doing great.
We got those, we got those, we got those.

113
00:05:30.151 --> 00:05:34.345
Okay, let's just take it one step further,
just for kicks and giggles.

114
00:05:34.345 --> 00:05:38.995
Kicks and giggles, just so
you know that this is real.

115
00:05:38.995 --> 00:05:40.242
So you know it's real.

116
00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.069
I'm gonna do another for loop.

117
00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:49.495
For savedCarEntry of saved cars.

118
00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:54.369
Is it savedCarList, what is it?

119
00:05:54.369 --> 00:05:56.103
One of two, let's get the right property.

120
00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.594
SavedCarList, okay.

121
00:05:59.366 --> 00:06:02.493
Yep, our savedCarList, let's do that.

122
00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:07.961
Let's track savedCarEntry,
blah, blah, blah.

123
00:06:07.961 --> 00:06:13.273
Okay, there we go, and then I'm just
gonna do a little crisp p here.

124
00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:15.692
But guess what, it's gonna know the types.

125
00:06:15.692 --> 00:06:22.780
So if I type savedCarEntry, not list,
entry., I got all my stuff.

126
00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.631
I got all my stuff there,
it already knows.

127
00:06:25.631 --> 00:06:26.761
So it's make then model.

128
00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:30.640
Make, and then we'll do our model.

129
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.540
Okay, this is just a little
flavor on top of this one, right,

130
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.346
just a little extra flavor.

131
00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:38.037
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.

132
00:06:38.037 --> 00:06:41.397
So if I save it, so now I wanna see,
there's no saved cars.

133
00:06:41.397 --> 00:06:43.336
So I'm gonna save one.

134
00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:44.506
Did I not?

135
00:06:44.506 --> 00:06:45.426
What?

136
00:06:45.426 --> 00:06:46.556
Did I not save it?

137
00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:48.604
Hold on, hold on.

138
00:06:50.697 --> 00:06:51.817
Is it just refreshing?

139
00:06:51.817 --> 00:06:52.846
Hold on, let me see.

140
00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:54.526
&gt;&gt; You gotta scroll horizontally.

141
00:06:54.526 --> 00:06:56.975
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Did I mess it up that bad?

142
00:06:56.975 --> 00:06:58.034
&gt;&gt; Think so.

143
00:06:58.034 --> 00:06:59.644
&gt;&gt; He says he think so.

144
00:06:59.644 --> 00:07:01.956
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, all right.

145
00:07:01.956 --> 00:07:03.278
&gt;&gt; SaveCar is in a new section.

146
00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:05.317
I think they'll show up below.

147
00:07:05.317 --> 00:07:11.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I think the way I've done it,
you gotta, [LAUGH] that feels bad.

148
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.993
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right,

149
00:07:12.993 --> 00:07:15.801
let me see if I can fix this real quick.

150
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:18.751
It's just the section that has that,
okay, fine.

151
00:07:18.751 --> 00:07:22.496
I wanna move this,
cuz I think if I just do this.

152
00:07:22.496 --> 00:07:25.315
Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure,
sure, okay, we'll fix it.

153
00:07:25.315 --> 00:07:29.609
I'm just gonna move it outside of our
container where the styles are, and

154
00:07:29.609 --> 00:07:32.041
then it'll show up right where I want it.

155
00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:33.019
Yeah, there you go.

156
00:07:33.019 --> 00:07:35.975
So let me zoom in a little bit just so
you can see.

157
00:07:35.975 --> 00:07:42.104
Okay, so if I do that, you see,
the cars are showing up as we save them.

158
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.882
I am not a UI engineer, friends at home,

159
00:07:47.882 --> 00:07:52.313
so if you're roasting me, save it, okay?

160
00:07:52.313 --> 00:07:53.236
All right, there you go.

161
00:07:53.236 --> 00:07:55.493
So I told you this was a beefy example,
right?

162
00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:58.373
We did a lot of stuff to
get this one to work.

163
00:07:58.373 --> 00:08:04.577
But that was the culmination of
control flow, property binding,

164
00:08:04.577 --> 00:08:10.021
event binding, event handling,
emitting, and input.

165
00:08:10.021 --> 00:08:13.150
So we did a lot of stuff,
you should be proud of yourself, okay?

166
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:14.851
I got something for
each and every one of y'all.

167
00:08:14.851 --> 00:08:17.671
See this, [SOUND] that's all for you all.

168
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:19.262
Good job, proud of you.

169
00:08:19.262 --> 00:08:20.591
Very good, very good.

170
00:08:20.591 --> 00:08:22.005
All right, let's get to the next.

171
00:08:22.005 --> 00:08:24.281
Well, before I move on,
what questions can I answer?

172
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:26.289
Cuz I'm sure the chat is lit up.

173
00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:30.437
&gt;&gt; Do inputs and outputs only work one
layer above or below a parent-child

174
00:08:30.437 --> 00:08:35.359
relationship, or can it happen when there
is more than one parent component above?

175
00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:40.834
&gt;&gt; Can you communicate
inputs all the way up?

176
00:08:40.834 --> 00:08:42.684
Can you go all the way up or
all the way down?

177
00:08:42.684 --> 00:08:47.768
Well, for input, from what I
understand about the way it works,

178
00:08:47.768 --> 00:08:49.717
you would not be able to.

179
00:08:49.717 --> 00:08:55.780
Okay, let me type it out, cuz that'll
help explain what I'm trying to say.

180
00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.143
So let's say that you have a div up here.

181
00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:02.819
Okay, we're just gonna type this out,
just so I can explain.

182
00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:07.618
So if I have my app, let's say,
car component, right, and

183
00:09:07.618 --> 00:09:11.019
this takes a car and
you send it a carEntry.

184
00:09:11.019 --> 00:09:14.500
Okay, so this is what you're
talking about can you do.

185
00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.917
Right, now if we have a component
that's higher than this,

186
00:09:17.917 --> 00:09:20.263
how would you get access to the property?

187
00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:25.133
So in React, the way you do
that is you prop drill, right?

188
00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:27.784
And that's weird,
cuz that becomes an anti-pattern.

189
00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:29.390
So you don't really wanna prop drill.

190
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:33.284
If you wanna share information,
you use something like a service, right?

191
00:09:33.284 --> 00:09:35.853
If you wanna share information with
different parts of the application.

192
00:09:35.853 --> 00:09:38.445
That's better than trying to figure out,

193
00:09:38.445 --> 00:09:42.412
how do I access this component
from a higher, higher component?

194
00:09:42.412 --> 00:09:44.633
You gotta find a better way
to share the information.

195
00:09:44.633 --> 00:09:46.526
And the service is probably a better way,

196
00:09:46.526 --> 00:09:49.889
in order to inject the value that can
be pulled from that child component.

197
00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.092
Yeah, that's a better way to do that.

198
00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.543
Prop drilling is a no, no, right?

199
00:09:54.543 --> 00:09:58.692
Cuz then you go 16 levels down just to
get a value from the top to the bottom.

200
00:09:58.692 --> 00:10:00.344
That's not the right way to go.

201
00:10:00.344 --> 00:10:03.502
Yeah, I'd say watch out for
your parentheses, watch out for

202
00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.726
your square brackets.

203
00:10:04.726 --> 00:10:09.041
Make sure that even your event
handler has the right parentheses and

204
00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:10.483
brackets there, so.

205
00:10:10.483 --> 00:10:14.302
&gt;&gt; Are the outputs just for
events, or would you use it for

206
00:10:14.302 --> 00:10:16.303
data you're passing back?

207
00:10:16.303 --> 00:10:20.914
Maybe it's a property that's gonna
get populated inside the logic of

208
00:10:20.914 --> 00:10:24.976
the component and
you wanna tell the parent component, hey,

209
00:10:24.976 --> 00:10:29.602
this is something that you could bind
to on the way out of my component.

210
00:10:29.602 --> 00:10:32.446
&gt;&gt; So I understand your question.

211
00:10:32.446 --> 00:10:38.235
So you can only output through events,
yeah.

212
00:10:38.235 --> 00:10:41.217
You can't do a property that
you wanna watch, so to speak.

213
00:10:41.217 --> 00:10:42.752
So people have asked for this,

214
00:10:42.752 --> 00:10:46.484
they asked for what you're kind of
describing as an observable property.

215
00:10:46.484 --> 00:10:50.589
So that way, if something changes,
you would know that the value changed or

216
00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:51.819
something like that.

217
00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:57.174
People have asked for that, and
we're gonna offer signal inputs.

218
00:10:57.174 --> 00:10:59.933
And we're gonna talk about signals
today so we'll get more experience.

219
00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:02.794
Signal inputs will solve
some of that problem,

220
00:11:02.794 --> 00:11:05.236
because you care about when it changed.

221
00:11:05.236 --> 00:11:07.125
The way we'll do that is signal.

222
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:10.873
But then people asked for
what's called observables, where events

223
00:11:10.873 --> 00:11:14.630
will populate about the stream
events that happen to that property.

224
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.543
Yeah, but we're not gonna do that,
we're gonna do signal inputs instead.

225
00:11:18.543 --> 00:11:22.029
Good question, that's a super question.

226
00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:24.129
You a genius?

227
00:11:24.129 --> 00:11:27.829
That was happening,
cuz that was a good question.

228
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:29.466
&gt;&gt; You mentioned services.

229
00:11:29.466 --> 00:11:31.971
&gt;&gt; Yes
&gt;&gt; Are we gonna get into services later?

230
00:11:31.971 --> 00:11:36.207
Are they context in React or
some kind of data store?

231
00:11:36.207 --> 00:11:41.476
&gt;&gt; Good question,
we are gonna get to services very soon.

232
00:11:41.476 --> 00:11:44.816
And then if it's context, I don't know
cuz I don't remember what context is.

233
00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:48.197
So [LAUGH] I don't
remember what that does.

234
00:11:48.197 --> 00:11:51.573
Context, is that the property,
sorry, the tag where you can say,

235
00:11:51.573 --> 00:11:54.192
this thing is available to
everyone who's a child?

236
00:11:54.192 --> 00:11:54.956
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

237
00:11:54.956 --> 00:11:56.866
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, it's not like that.

238
00:11:56.866 --> 00:12:01.027
No, no, no, no, no, a service is more
like a service that you would see

239
00:12:01.027 --> 00:12:03.645
in traditional application architecture.

240
00:12:03.645 --> 00:12:07.150
So you say there's a service that
holds some value, some data, and

241
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.190
you call that service to get that data.

242
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.348
That's how you can share your
data around your application.

243
00:12:12.348 --> 00:12:13.316
And we're gonna do that.

244
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:15.928
That's a great question, so
let's get closer to doing that.

245
00:12:15.928 --> 00:12:20.920
We're just wrapping up this example for
inputs, outputs.

246
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.762
And I'll just quickly go through
the steps one more time,

247
00:12:23.762 --> 00:12:26.210
just to make sure that
we're all on the same page.

248
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.098
The first thing that we did was that
we created our app listing component,

249
00:12:30.098 --> 00:12:32.617
and then we moved all of
the content over there.

250
00:12:32.617 --> 00:12:35.680
So we reference it here on line 13.

251
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:42.209
In that component, we defined an input
of type car in the listing component.

252
00:12:42.209 --> 00:12:46.217
And we define an output,
which is in the event emitter,

253
00:12:46.217 --> 00:12:50.325
which means it sends up events and
it sends up of type car.

254
00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:55.592
And then we handle the event, so
we bind to that event with addCarToSaved.

255
00:12:55.592 --> 00:13:00.584
And this special $event, that's how we
can know what was sent from our event.

256
00:13:00.584 --> 00:13:05.298
Because sometimes you may event, sorry,
you may emit that something happened,

257
00:13:05.298 --> 00:13:07.564
but you don't have any value, right?

258
00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:09.134
You're just like, yeah,
this thing happened.

259
00:13:09.134 --> 00:13:12.381
The person interacted with
the application, but there's no value for

260
00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:13.255
you to know about.

261
00:13:13.255 --> 00:13:16.018
So you can just have an empty
event emitted, so to speak,

262
00:13:16.018 --> 00:13:17.984
where you don't emit anything, okay?

263
00:13:17.984 --> 00:13:21.700
And then we have our event handler
where we add to the list down here

264
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.588
at the bottom.

265
00:13:22.588 --> 00:13:27.462
But if we're over here, there's
a couple of things to take note of.

266
00:13:27.462 --> 00:13:33.150
Got our input set as required, and
we say it won't be no for the car.

267
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:34.478
We got our output.

268
00:13:34.478 --> 00:13:39.360
We called it carSaved, and we said it's
an event emitter of type car which tracks,

269
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.711
because that's what we saw
in our app.component.ts,

270
00:13:42.711 --> 00:13:46.655
what TypeScript was telling us
that it knew about this component.

271
00:13:46.655 --> 00:13:50.490
And then, here in the handleCarSaved,
just so that way,

272
00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:54.032
cuz there's a few events
happening at the same time.

273
00:13:54.032 --> 00:13:55.621
Let me just make sure I clarify this one.

274
00:13:55.621 --> 00:14:01.722
This one is just for our button, so
we can trigger the emission, right?

275
00:14:01.722 --> 00:14:03.907
That's what we're trying to do,
is to get the emission to happen.

276
00:14:03.907 --> 00:14:06.368
So we just added a button
called handleCarSaved.

277
00:14:06.368 --> 00:14:09.046
But that's not a part of the output,
so to speak.

278
00:14:09.046 --> 00:14:09.941
It's completely separate.

279
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:14.193
This could be anything, but we just
needed a way for this emission to happen.

280
00:14:14.193 --> 00:14:18.167
Another thing that we might have
been able to do was, can I do this?

281
00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:20.004
Let's see,
let's see if we could have even done this.

282
00:14:20.004 --> 00:14:22.924
I don't know if we could have done this or
not.

283
00:14:22.924 --> 00:14:23.743
Let me try something.

284
00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:26.209
Let me just experimentation, okay?

285
00:14:26.209 --> 00:14:29.384
So it kinda works.

286
00:14:29.384 --> 00:14:30.974
Okay, so that also works.

287
00:14:30.974 --> 00:14:34.714
So that might have helped a little bit
to kinda remove one of the events.

288
00:14:34.714 --> 00:14:37.652
But this isn't really
necessarily the best practice.

289
00:14:37.652 --> 00:14:38.681
Let me tell you why.

290
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:43.998
What if you have multiple things
to do before you hit the emission?

291
00:14:43.998 --> 00:14:48.302
So that's why I had a function there,
because if I had to maybe adjust some

292
00:14:48.302 --> 00:14:52.134
data, do some other tasks,
you can't fit them all in one liner.

293
00:14:52.134 --> 00:14:54.090
In our case,
we could've fit it into one liner,

294
00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.111
that might've made it a little clearer,
right?

295
00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:59.866
So we got a button that we're saying,
hey, you click the Save car button,

296
00:14:59.866 --> 00:15:01.725
we're gonna just do this emission.

297
00:15:01.725 --> 00:15:05.775
So maybe that helps a little bit to
clarify where everything puts into place.
