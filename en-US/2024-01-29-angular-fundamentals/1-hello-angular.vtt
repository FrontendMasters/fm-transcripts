00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.810
So let's just try it, all right,
let's just get up in the mix.

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.490
Here's what I want you to do,
let's head over to angular.dev/playground.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.795
Now in the upper right corner,
there's a drop down menu,

4
00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:16.240
in the upper right corner
right above the code editor.

5
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.210
Go ahead and select Hello World.

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.910
So here's what we'll do.

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.600
So this is our new website, angular.dev.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.040
You can code Angular and
try to Angular right in the browser.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.070
Now that's one of our major features
that we want to bring to the learning

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.460
experience for Angular.

11
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.140
So we'll do our course today in VS Code.

12
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.195
However, I just wanted to show you that
if you want to just try something new,

13
00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:39.080
just try it here, you just jump right in.

14
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:47.259
So right on line 8, there is some
code that says Hello world on line 8.

15
00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:50.923
Change that to Hello universe or
to whatever you want it to be.

16
00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.529
Do me one more favor,
just one small thing.

17
00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:58.811
If you get your left hand
up if you can for me.

18
00:00:58.811 --> 00:00:59.836
Check this out.

19
00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:00.884
High five from me to you.

20
00:01:00.884 --> 00:01:01.684
Good job, friends.

21
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:04.454
You just updated your Angular code, right?

22
00:01:04.454 --> 00:01:05.964
You just updated your first Angular code.

23
00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:08.704
If you've never done Angular before,
you are now an Angular developer.

24
00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:12.984
You just updated code, it compiled, and
it's running in the online playground.

25
00:01:12.984 --> 00:01:16.744
So you got that value right out of
the box of being able to change it up.

26
00:01:16.744 --> 00:01:20.916
Now, this is just showing
you that Angular templates,

27
00:01:20.916 --> 00:01:24.022
which is a part of the Angular component,

28
00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:28.961
is how you get to determine
what's visible on the screen.

29
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:32.488
Before we jump right in now, I'm just
gonna let you know this the project setup

30
00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:35.330
we talked about, the installation,
on your local machines.

31
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.122
And friends at home,
if you're checking this out,

32
00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:42.945
at the time of this recording is Angular
17.01, but that's okay if you're at 17,

33
00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:45.694
all this stuff still works from 17 and
above.

34
00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:48.344
That's the core component for
this workshop.

35
00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:50.794
Anything that's 17 and above,
all the things I'll show you today work.

36
00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:54.528
All right,
make sure that you've cloned the repo so

37
00:01:54.528 --> 00:01:56.704
you can have everything from this URL.

38
00:01:56.704 --> 00:01:58.564
I'm sorry that it's so long.

39
00:01:58.564 --> 00:02:01.156
I didn't think it through,
I thought about it later.

40
00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:03.631
I was like, this is very long URL,
doesn't fit on one line.

41
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:08.686
Okay, yeah, so you can HTTPS clone or
you can do SSH, all right.

42
00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:13.506
Now, here's an important step for
everyone.

43
00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:15.214
Make sure that you have all
the dependencies installed.

44
00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:20.064
So on your computer, on your computer,
go into this project,

45
00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:24.922
your Angular fundamentals lessons,
and to the root project.

46
00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:27.442
And then you're gonna do npm install, and

47
00:02:27.442 --> 00:02:32.074
this will bring down all of your
dependencies, okay, for your application.

48
00:02:32.074 --> 00:02:37.748
Just like any other web library you ever
use, framework, it's the same pattern.

49
00:02:37.748 --> 00:02:38.926
All right, and
then once those dependencies,

50
00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:39.963
it's gonna probably take a few seconds.

51
00:02:39.963 --> 00:02:42.606
So it's npms, npms,
it's probably gonna take some time.

52
00:02:42.606 --> 00:02:47.151
And then we're gonna do ng serve,

53
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:54.212
ng space serve space 01-hello-angular,
okay?

54
00:02:54.212 --> 00:02:56.376
So this is all the stuff
that you folks will need.

55
00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.236
Even at home, friends,
make sure you're doing this.

56
00:02:58.236 --> 00:03:00.500
This will make sure that you're
ready to code with us today.

57
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.293
This is a confirmation round, okay?

58
00:03:03.293 --> 00:03:05.924
If you get this all to work,
you'd be ready to code with us today.

59
00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:07.303
All right now,
how will you know that you're ready?

60
00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:09.403
And if you got these slides at home,
you go at your own pace.

61
00:03:09.403 --> 00:03:11.143
But how will you know you're ready?

62
00:03:11.143 --> 00:03:13.923
If you're reading this,
things have worked out well.

63
00:03:13.923 --> 00:03:18.032
So if you go into the browser,
localhost:4200.

64
00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:20.413
This is what I'm hoping
that you're seeing.
