00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.550
We just finished talking about
how to use reactive forms.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.780
Let's actually use them.

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.400
Let's build something with
reactive forms right now.

4
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.266
So I'm gonna go into the My Folders here.

5
00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:13.408
All right, go to README, and

6
00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:18.590
then we should be right
as rain look at that.

7
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.046
Reactive forms is spelled correctly,
hopefully.

8
00:00:21.046 --> 00:00:25.809
That way we will not [LAUGH]
add into the error count.

9
00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.189
Bam, first try.

10
00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.099
You see that?

11
00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.299
Professional, okay.

12
00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.299
So here is what we are gonna
do with Reactive Forms.

13
00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:39.027
First you have to enable Reactive Forms
by importing the Reactive Forms

14
00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:42.513
module at the file level,
and then into the import.

15
00:00:42.513 --> 00:00:44.173
So let's do that work now.

16
00:00:46.238 --> 00:00:47.193
I'm feeling energized.

17
00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:49.988
I'm thinking about how
much fun this is gonna be.

18
00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:54.833
Let's go and some candy.

19
00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:55.803
I'm also thinking about candy.

20
00:00:57.003 --> 00:01:00.965
All right I think I did this for
you already.

21
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.855
You lucky because I care about you
that I already do this for you?

22
00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:09.245
Wow, I must really care
about because I did that.

23
00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:09.815
That's nice.

24
00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:13.410
Man Mark why you being so nice to people?

25
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.595
No so my nature.

26
00:01:14.595 --> 00:01:18.615
Okay, so the first step I did for
you because I want your life to be easier.

27
00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.893
And then we'll get to define the model for
controls model.

28
00:01:21.893 --> 00:01:24.908
Now this is the part that I was telling
you about where we had to programmatically

29
00:01:24.908 --> 00:01:27.023
define the different things
that will be on our screen.

30
00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:31.685
So if we look at our blog post again, now
it's gonna be a reactive version because

31
00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:35.333
we did the template version that
will do the reactive version.

32
00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:38.933
So we got two properties
that we're gonna do.

33
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.981
So we got sorry not two properties,
we have the main property and

34
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:43.949
then Is gonna have two controls.

35
00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:48.363
So let's start by importing form group,
and

36
00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:52.229
form control in app.component.ts.

37
00:01:52.229 --> 00:02:00.968
So let's do that work, Form group,

38
00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:07.635
form control, Okay from, all right.

39
00:02:13.497 --> 00:02:15.056
All right, so we got those two.

40
00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:20.158
Now if we wanted to we could
actually combine these two imports,

41
00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:24.865
which I will just for
posterity, yeah, there you go.

42
00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:28.275
BAM so we got foreign group,
foreign control, Reactive forms,

43
00:02:28.275 --> 00:02:29.805
all available to us.

44
00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:33.045
Let me collapse our components so
we can just focus on this part.

45
00:02:33.045 --> 00:02:36.975
So now we need to define our what's
the highest level for Reactive form?

46
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.225
Do I remember that part?

47
00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:41.550
Let's go back.

48
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:46.813
Okay, let's look at this example.

49
00:02:46.813 --> 00:02:48.069
Okay, what's the highest level here?

50
00:02:50.397 --> 00:02:51.413
&gt;&gt; You mean the form group?

51
00:02:51.413 --> 00:02:52.673
&gt;&gt; The form group, that's right.

52
00:02:52.673 --> 00:02:54.963
So that's like the outside thing
I want you to think about.

53
00:02:54.963 --> 00:02:59.903
So this one is gonna be called
blog form equals new form group.

54
00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:04.835
And then we're gonna give
it some form controls.

55
00:03:06.353 --> 00:03:09.135
I know I didn't give you the controls yet.

56
00:03:09.135 --> 00:03:10.784
Relax, wait, I made that like a function.

57
00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:11.535
Hold on, sorry.

58
00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:12.625
That should go inside of there.

59
00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.125
There you go.

60
00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:17.827
Okay, says the blog title,

61
00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:22.679
which is a new form
control which is awesome,

62
00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:26.886
and it's probably gonna be a string.

63
00:03:26.886 --> 00:03:29.486
I think we can confirm that
it's gonna be a string.

64
00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:33.086
And then we have the body,
which is also a new foreign control.

65
00:03:33.086 --> 00:03:34.638
Intellisense, get out of the way!

66
00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.671
[LAUGH] Alright, so
that's our foreign controls.

67
00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:43.853
Okay, that form group.

68
00:03:43.853 --> 00:03:47.435
Alright, so we got that click and
we're feeling good about that.

69
00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.315
Alright, so title and body, bam, done.

70
00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:54.154
Now we need to update it
to bind it to the template.

71
00:03:54.154 --> 00:04:00.565
So the first thing is we want to bind
our form group to our blog form.

72
00:04:00.565 --> 00:04:03.641
So let's do that as all
in app.component.ts so

73
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.271
now we can go back to our component class.

74
00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:08.507
And we find our form.

75
00:04:08.507 --> 00:04:09.211
There it is.

76
00:04:10.711 --> 00:04:13.261
I wanna say this hey,
you got a forum group?

77
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:13.999
I sure do.
And

78
00:04:13.999 --> 00:04:17.274
well I'm gonna say it equals blog form.

79
00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:23.479
Nice and crisp.

80
00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.639
Now we can go even further.

81
00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.575
So down by the title,
remember that form control name?

82
00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:34.439
Okay, the first one is
gonna be called title.

83
00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:35.793
Now that string title,

84
00:04:35.793 --> 00:04:40.519
that's going to be used to look up in
that form control's object, right?

85
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.134
Angle's gonna look it up so
it has to match.

86
00:04:43.134 --> 00:04:46.656
But no square brackets unless
you're trying to do something more

87
00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:49.820
advanced like some dynamic
form control stuff.

88
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.110
And you can get really robust and
really creative, right?

89
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.400
You can dynamically create your forms,
create entries, and do things like that.

90
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.350
That is totally possible friends.

91
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.910
You can do whatever you
can think of really?

92
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.495
All right, let's do the same thing for
our text area.

93
00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:12.095
All right, so I'm just gonna slide
it down just a little bit and

94
00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:17.430
I'm gonna say formControlName=,
and this one is body.

95
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:23.435
Okay, we are cooking all right,
sounds good.

96
00:05:23.435 --> 00:05:25.235
All right, here's what we'll do.

97
00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:26.195
We'll take some of this out.

98
00:05:26.195 --> 00:05:27.915
I don't think we need
this name right here.

99
00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:29.215
We can take that out.

100
00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.125
It's not breaking anything.

101
00:05:31.125 --> 00:05:33.875
Okay, so but let's see.

102
00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.585
I think we're doing pretty good.

103
00:05:40.445 --> 00:05:41.681
Yeah, we did that.

104
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:45.071
Update input title by
adding the form control.

105
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:47.791
All right, the input with the title,
yes, right, with the ID of title.

106
00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:49.391
That's what that hashtag means, sorry.

107
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:52.541
When I wrote that, I was trying to
find a succinct way to write that.

108
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:53.881
Sorry if that's confusing.

109
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:57.025
The same input with the ID,
hashtag is ID, right,

110
00:05:57.025 --> 00:06:01.866
of title, and you set the form control
name attribute inside into you do body.

111
00:06:03.096 --> 00:06:08.723
Okay, now I think I have an extra square
bracket when I did a binding Yep,

112
00:06:08.723 --> 00:06:12.534
that happens sometimes
sometimes I type too fast and

113
00:06:12.534 --> 00:06:17.716
I get an extra square bracket
that's me for when I typed it.

114
00:06:17.716 --> 00:06:18.714
Cuz I did like this.

115
00:06:18.714 --> 00:06:23.479
Yeah, that happened sorry,
I'm the World's fastest typer.

116
00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.829
My bad.

117
00:06:24.829 --> 00:06:29.409
All right, no more errors,
and now our blog is back.

118
00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:30.456
Our blog is back.

119
00:06:31.923 --> 00:06:35.219
All right, so we have our parts there.

120
00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.269
Now we just wanna handle the on submit.

121
00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:41.133
So now you wanna call the blog,
the post blog function, and

122
00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:44.255
pass it in the title and
body as parameters.

123
00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:47.252
How do we handle the submission
though when somebody clicks submit,

124
00:06:47.252 --> 00:06:50.713
it might remember that the thing that I
was telling you about the event is wrapped

125
00:06:50.713 --> 00:06:51.505
in parentheses.

126
00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:55.870
&gt;&gt; Ng model.

127
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:56.547
&gt;&gt; You said it.

128
00:06:56.547 --> 00:06:58.035
I'm just happy.

129
00:06:59.265 --> 00:07:00.435
Yeah, that was good.

130
00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:01.625
&gt;&gt; Was I wrong?

131
00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:02.595
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

132
00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:04.805
&gt;&gt; You're so right.

133
00:07:04.805 --> 00:07:05.705
That's the problem.

134
00:07:06.725 --> 00:07:11.265
You are so right and I just loved it.

135
00:07:11.265 --> 00:07:15.965
Sorry, my reactions are exaggerated but
I am really impressed.

136
00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:17.085
So good stuff.

137
00:07:17.085 --> 00:07:19.015
Okay, good.

138
00:07:19.015 --> 00:07:25.033
So ng submit Okay,

139
00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:28.147
and then we should be okay.

140
00:07:28.147 --> 00:07:30.057
So that's our handle form submit.

141
00:07:32.915 --> 00:07:34.087
This the wrong function.

142
00:07:34.087 --> 00:07:36.857
I'm sorry I typed the wrong thing and
efference, forgive me.

143
00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:42.001
Should we handle form submit All right,

144
00:07:42.001 --> 00:07:45.845
let's make sure that we
got no errors there, okay?

145
00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:48.725
So here's how we can confirm
that it's working for us.

146
00:07:48.725 --> 00:07:54.245
So if we go to this thing and
that thing and then we submit a post.

147
00:07:55.295 --> 00:07:56.925
I think I might have broken it.

148
00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:58.344
I think I broke it.

149
00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.589
I think I got to put my because
this is the event handler.

150
00:08:00.589 --> 00:08:02.634
Why do I have so
many parentheses I don't know.

151
00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:05.554
Too many parentheses.

152
00:08:05.554 --> 00:08:07.004
Sorry about that.

153
00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:11.144
Okay, so let's get back to inside
of our handle form submit.

154
00:08:12.354 --> 00:08:14.431
Before we go to the next step.

155
00:08:14.431 --> 00:08:17.424
I just wanna do this just for
for kicks and giggles.

156
00:08:17.424 --> 00:08:18.994
Just because I like having fun.

157
00:08:18.994 --> 00:08:20.954
Okay, so we can do form submitted.

158
00:08:20.954 --> 00:08:25.579
The second greatest debugging technique is
a console.log to make sure that everything

159
00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:27.004
is working for us.

160
00:08:27.004 --> 00:08:29.424
We're having a good time, so
we put something in there.

161
00:08:29.424 --> 00:08:33.424
Okay, so our form is being submitted,
but the page is not being refreshed.

162
00:08:33.424 --> 00:08:35.304
And here's what's the best part.

163
00:08:35.304 --> 00:08:38.745
You see, so when I hit submit,
it doesn't refresh.

164
00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:40.185
And we don't lose our data.

165
00:08:40.185 --> 00:08:41.875
So that's how we know
our binding is working.

166
00:08:41.875 --> 00:08:46.234
Okay, so now we can just take
this home by calling post blog,

167
00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:51.715
which this function could be a call to
like a service or something like that.

168
00:08:51.715 --> 00:08:56.482
But right now,
we're just gonna console.log it anyway.

169
00:08:56.482 --> 00:08:59.122
Okay, so now what do we pass in here?

170
00:08:59.122 --> 00:09:01.686
How do we get our values
out of this thing?

171
00:09:03.006 --> 00:09:03.876
What's the first part?

172
00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.846
Just tell me the first
part you can think of.

173
00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:09.120
What's the first part to get
our values out of the form?

174
00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:13.866
You probably have to
reference the form right?

175
00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:14.846
So let's reference the form.

176
00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:18.730
So we'll say this dot blog form, ok.

177
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.722
So we're almost there,
if we do .value, and

178
00:09:23.722 --> 00:09:27.306
can you see in that upper corner,

179
00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:32.516
it tells you what
the value of the form is.

180
00:09:32.516 --> 00:09:34.776
It's either null or a string.

181
00:09:34.776 --> 00:09:38.746
So when we do .value,
we have some properties there.

182
00:09:38.746 --> 00:09:40.334
So let's do that.
To do that as you dot value and

183
00:09:40.334 --> 00:09:42.056
then we'll do dot.

184
00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:46.706
The first thing he wants is title and

185
00:09:46.706 --> 00:09:53.062
then we do this .blogform.value.body okay,

186
00:09:53.062 --> 00:09:55.856
so we should be good.

187
00:09:55.856 --> 00:09:56.566
Why are you complaining?

188
00:09:56.566 --> 00:09:57.246
Why aren't you happy?

189
00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:01.548
This stop.
A post-block excuse me.

190
00:10:01.548 --> 00:10:04.903
Okay good good good good we should be
good to go this is should be a string,

191
00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:06.016
what's your problem?

192
00:10:12.281 --> 00:10:15.746
Why are you complaining this
seems like a moment of complain

193
00:10:15.746 --> 00:10:19.090
that you shouldn't be complaining about,
fine we can.

194
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:20.511
We can update this.

195
00:10:22.264 --> 00:10:28.081
But that feels like extra work here,
let's see, or null, what?

196
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:33.740
I don't like that, hold on, okay.

197
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:37.586
So, we have to update our
type to be a union type here,

198
00:10:37.586 --> 00:10:40.331
because with a template driven form.

199
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:43.070
Here's the problem.

200
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:45.331
You don't start with a reactive form.

201
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:46.341
Here's the problem.

202
00:10:46.341 --> 00:10:50.371
You are not sure what the type
could be null or undefined as well.

203
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:52.961
And that's the prompt for
a value in the form.

204
00:10:52.961 --> 00:10:56.451
So you also have to update this
to be like your union site.

205
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:57.801
So we'll set that to be a union type.

206
00:10:57.801 --> 00:11:01.623
Now I will keep my screen together for
a second just so you can see it.

207
00:11:01.623 --> 00:11:06.234
Hold on, let me just organize it
that way we can all be in the best

208
00:11:06.234 --> 00:11:08.157
place of success you see.

209
00:11:08.157 --> 00:11:12.997
So, for post blog, I have to update
the types for my title and for my body.

210
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:17.058
Okay, update both types.

211
00:11:17.058 --> 00:11:21.973
And now, with both types being updated,
we can save this.

212
00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:27.492
Okay, I'm gonna save this, and
then if we go back to our screen and

213
00:11:27.492 --> 00:11:31.052
submit a post, you see, there we go,so.

214
00:11:36.213 --> 00:11:38.411
So, here's the blog post,
I'm going to tell you another story.

215
00:11:42.626 --> 00:11:44.212
It's been two years in Hollywood.

216
00:11:46.267 --> 00:11:50.347
My agent thinks I'm

217
00:11:50.347 --> 00:11:55.153
going to finally EGOT.

218
00:11:55.153 --> 00:11:57.999
I already won an ME.

219
00:11:59.094 --> 00:12:00.644
For my, it's not enemy damn.

220
00:12:01.764 --> 00:12:02.804
You spell Emmy?

221
00:12:02.804 --> 00:12:04.864
Emmy or run an Emmy?

222
00:12:04.864 --> 00:12:05.504
For what?

223
00:12:05.504 --> 00:12:06.494
What did I win it for this?

224
00:12:09.064 --> 00:12:09.677
For my front end?

225
00:12:09.677 --> 00:12:13.799
Yeah, for my front end master's course.

226
00:12:13.799 --> 00:12:18.074
My rap skills got that young.

227
00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:23.832
Okay, what do you get for Grammy?

228
00:12:23.832 --> 00:12:25.043
Thank you, that young Grammy.

229
00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:37.572
My latest film, Will secure my Oscar.

230
00:12:37.572 --> 00:12:38.683
What's my film name?

231
00:12:45.117 --> 00:12:46.547
The code teacher.

232
00:12:46.547 --> 00:12:51.850
All right, listen, that film,
the movie poster is me walking

233
00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:58.297
on a desolate road with a keyboard to
go teach code to people who need it.

234
00:12:58.297 --> 00:13:01.297
All right I want to go okay,
well look at you see.

235
00:13:01.297 --> 00:13:04.947
So all that works now,
it works the same way as other form.

236
00:13:04.947 --> 00:13:09.761
And so I showed you both examples to use
the template form and the reactive form

237
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:14.815
what is your opinion so give me a thumbs
up if you prefer to template driven style.

238
00:13:16.529 --> 00:13:19.622
Okay, give me a thumbs up if people
you prefer the reactive style?

239
00:13:21.484 --> 00:13:23.043
All right some of you all are lying.

240
00:13:23.043 --> 00:13:26.164
I'll give you nothing because I don't
even care about either one of these,

241
00:13:26.164 --> 00:13:27.403
which is also a valid answer.

242
00:13:27.403 --> 00:13:30.328
&gt;&gt; I haven't made up my mind yet
based on our small example.

243
00:13:30.328 --> 00:13:31.823
&gt;&gt; Okay, undecided.

244
00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:36.595
But the thing I do like about the reactive
form style, even for a small form,

245
00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:41.067
the thing I do like about it is that I
know what the data is going to be, and

246
00:13:41.067 --> 00:13:43.475
I know what the controls are gonna be.

247
00:13:43.475 --> 00:13:47.559
I just like the very distinct nature of
that, whereas with a template-driven form,

248
00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:51.825
I have to read the template to even
know what everything's gonna be.

249
00:13:51.825 --> 00:13:54.259
But this, I'm looking at this
blog form group, I'm like,

250
00:13:54.259 --> 00:13:55.419
I know what the answers are.
