1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.881
Let's take a step kind of far back and

2
00:00:02.881 --> 00:00:08.660
I want you to think about the story
that we've been telling so far.

3
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.448
Now, you can make
a multi-page application that

4
00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:18.890
can display and
communicate with components.

5
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.851
That's what you can do right now.

6
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:25.475
Those are all the skills you can do, you
could do dynamic data in components, you

7
00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:29.492
could display a multi page application,
you can do all of that so far.

8
00:00:29.492 --> 00:00:33.988
So now hopefully this is kind of bringing
clarity to the point where I said, well,

9
00:00:33.988 --> 00:00:37.048
you don't need a ton of stuff,
right, to get started,

10
00:00:37.048 --> 00:00:40.976
even though Angular is very broad and
very deep, you don't need a lot.

11
00:00:40.976 --> 00:00:44.345
I mean, you can do a lot with just this.

12
00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:46.672
But you can do more if
you had a few more tools.

13
00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:49.121
So we're gonna continue
to build out our tools.

14
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:51.368
Before you roll,
any questions I can answer?

15
00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.518
&gt;&gt; I'm just a little unclear
on the router-outlet.

16
00:00:56.812 --> 00:00:57.778
&gt;&gt; Good question.

17
00:00:57.778 --> 00:01:02.682
Router outlet,
this is literally just the space in our

18
00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:06.697
component where we will display the route.

19
00:01:06.697 --> 00:01:10.787
So meaning, when you route to the greeting
component, where would that be displayed?

20
00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:12.507
But let me show you what I mean by that.

21
00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:14.437
So I'm gonna do this.

22
00:01:14.437 --> 00:01:15.448
Can I make this work?

23
00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:16.368
It probably ain't going to work.

24
00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:17.775
Let's see.

25
00:01:17.775 --> 00:01:19.855
We talked about music today.

26
00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:20.748
Okay, cool.

27
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:24.240
So I'm gonna take this music note, and
I'm gonna repeat it a bunch of times.

28
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.379
I'm sorry if it's hard to read.

29
00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.882
It's not bad.

30
00:01:28.742 --> 00:01:29.852
Watch this.

31
00:01:29.852 --> 00:01:32.182
Okay, so now, you see?

32
00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:39.512
So the router outlet is literally
the place on the page where

33
00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:42.316
wherever you route to,
where it's gonna show up.

34
00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:44.106
That's what I was saying
that you could share.

35
00:01:44.106 --> 00:01:47.788
So now imagine instead of saying enable
routing to see the greeting below,

36
00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:49.786
imagine that was a header for your page.

37
00:01:49.786 --> 00:01:52.696
You know, with your menu bar, right?

38
00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:57.572
And then imagine that you
could click Hello or About us,

39
00:01:57.572 --> 00:02:02.251
or blah, blah, blah, and
then it all appears here.

40
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:03.296
But I'll show you more of that,
don't worry.

41
00:02:03.296 --> 00:02:04.780
I'm gonna get you there.

42
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.393
But did that help clarify what that does?

43
00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:07.592
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you.

44
00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:09.258
&gt;&gt; But I'm gonna do one more thing,
I can't help myself.

45
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.402
All right, I can't control myself, sorry.

46
00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:16.498
All right, refresh.

47
00:02:16.498 --> 00:02:17.780
It's there.

48
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.460
You see, that's what that gap is.

49
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.685
It just didn't like what I did.

50
00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:23.873
It was like, no,
you're not gonna get away with that.

51
00:02:23.873 --> 00:02:25.617
But I could do this, though.

52
00:02:25.617 --> 00:02:28.722
Okay, let me show a more practical
example instead of being silly, okay.

53
00:02:28.722 --> 00:02:30.551
Hold on,
let me just get this out of there.

54
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.207
Cuz that's a great question,
I love that question.

55
00:02:32.207 --> 00:02:36.900
So I can also put this in a section, okay?

56
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:43.829
Just a container,
nothing special about the section.

57
00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.938
But let's say if I gave it a style, and

58
00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:52.818
I said the style was
border: solid 1px red,

59
00:02:52.818 --> 00:02:58.222
the most famous debugging
style in the universe.

60
00:02:58.222 --> 00:03:00.293
Okay, let's see if that
does what I want it to do.

61
00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:02.437
You see?

62
00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:04.594
My router outlet is just
contained anywhere,

63
00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:07.320
cuz it's just rendering
a component at the end of the day.

64
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.613
Which I understand, because if you're
thinking about the router outlet,

65
00:03:10.613 --> 00:03:12.734
or routing is like the whole
page is refreshing.

66
00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.396
The whole page is changing,
because the URL is changing.

67
00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:16.496
That's not the case.

68
00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:21.086
What routing is doing in Angular
is choosing which component

69
00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:25.056
to display on the page that
has a router outlet in it.

70
00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.202
So now if I moved it out of there,
that's a great question.

71
00:03:31.202 --> 00:03:32.784
Love this clarifying question.

72
00:03:32.784 --> 00:03:36.043
See, that box is now empty.

73
00:03:36.043 --> 00:03:37.352
I can put this wherever I want.

74
00:03:37.352 --> 00:03:38.884
Let's see.

75
00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:40.648
I can do that too, right,

76
00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:44.912
cuz it's just moving that component
around on the screen now.

77
00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:47.426
Yeah, good question.

78
00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:48.256
That was excellent.

79
00:03:49.436 --> 00:03:51.450
Great clarifying question, okay.

80
00:03:54.253 --> 00:03:57.688
All right, before we move on,
what other questions can I answer?

81
00:04:00.597 --> 00:04:02.620
Okay, we'll keep going.

82
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.908
This is a good question that I
would have asked, all right, Mark,

83
00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:10.545
you show me how to route if I went to the
default route, what about the rest of it?

84
00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:11.675
You're right, good question.

85
00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:12.305
Let's do this.

86
00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:13.616
How do you make links,

87
00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:17.715
actual clickable links on the page
that I can click to with my mouse?

88
00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:18.775
How do I do that?

89
00:04:18.775 --> 00:04:21.545
Okay, you use what's called
the router link to do that.

90
00:04:21.545 --> 00:04:22.709
So we got the router link.

91
00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:26.689
It's an attribute.

92
00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:31.407
It's a special attribute in
Angular called a directive.

93
00:04:31.407 --> 00:04:32.693
It's called a directive.

94
00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:38.533
And a directive has the same
kind of makeup as a component.

95
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:43.729
But most times, they don't have
templates associated with it.

96
00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.164
What a directive is really great
at is adding behavior, friends.

97
00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:55.249
It adds behavior to an HTML element,
for example, or to a component.

98
00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.009
So now, what do I mean by that?

99
00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.926
This a tag used to, before I got involved,
it used to just link to a different page.

100
00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:07.854
But now, it links to a component
because of the routerLink.

101
00:05:07.854 --> 00:05:12.758
You see, so I changed the behavior of
the a tag with the action of the directive

102
00:05:12.758 --> 00:05:14.354
attribute routerLink.

103
00:05:14.354 --> 00:05:19.216
So I got that, and then I go to details,
which is my path, where I'm gonna go,

104
00:05:19.216 --> 00:05:20.042
go to there.

105
00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:23.853
But we know what's at details,
it's the details component most likely.

106
00:05:23.853 --> 00:05:28.502
All right, and
we got RouterLink there, okay.

107
00:05:28.502 --> 00:05:30.700
We're still on the routes, right?

108
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.290
Here's the thing that
you probably do a lot.

109
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.140
Give me a thumbs up if
you've ever done this.

110
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.455
You've had a route like to details, but
you have to pass it an id or something.

111
00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:40.968
You've done that before, right?

112
00:05:40.968 --> 00:05:43.328
Okay, you can do that in Angular, right,

113
00:05:43.328 --> 00:05:47.079
cuz you might wanna show the display
data for a particular element.

114
00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:47.941
How do you get there?

115
00:05:47.941 --> 00:05:48.661
This is how you get there.

116
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:51.765
For our path, we have details for /:id.

117
00:05:51.765 --> 00:05:54.444
That :id is a placeholder, okay.

118
00:05:54.444 --> 00:05:59.266
So, that's a placeholder, meaning that
a dynamic value will be available

119
00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:02.143
there once someone
navigates to this route.

120
00:06:02.143 --> 00:06:07.763
And I can even get access to this id,
okay, this placeholder.

121
00:06:07.763 --> 00:06:08.879
I can even get access to it.

122
00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.977
Let me show you how we can do that.

123
00:06:14.585 --> 00:06:17.453
All right, so there's my product id.

124
00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:21.113
So I call this the destination for
the route info.

125
00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:23.872
Eventually, whenever I get that id,

126
00:06:23.872 --> 00:06:28.365
I want it to live in this product id,
okay, whenever I get it.

127
00:06:28.365 --> 00:06:31.881
So I can use it to look up the product
information from the database, or

128
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.143
whatever I'm gonna do.

129
00:06:34.883 --> 00:06:36.590
Our friend Input is back.

130
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.145
Can I say hey Input, hey Input.

131
00:06:39.145 --> 00:06:39.705
Thank you.

132
00:06:39.705 --> 00:06:44.057
All right, Input is back,
but in the form of a setter.

133
00:06:44.057 --> 00:06:49.523
And the syntax looks a little tricky,
so let's make sure we break it down.

134
00:06:49.523 --> 00:06:57.417
I'm saying set the id as an input, okay.

135
00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:01.935
And then I want to assign
the value that I get to productId.

136
00:07:01.935 --> 00:07:04.423
But that name id,
that name looks familiar.

137
00:07:07.534 --> 00:07:08.544
You see it now?

138
00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:10.281
You see that id on the path?

139
00:07:12.421 --> 00:07:16.051
&gt;&gt; So
the path is where you're defining it.

140
00:07:16.051 --> 00:07:18.351
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm defining it on the path.

141
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.061
You see that :id?

142
00:07:20.061 --> 00:07:21.061
That has to match.

143
00:07:23.394 --> 00:07:28.205
Because if I do this format,
this is a nice shortcut, okay?

144
00:07:28.205 --> 00:07:32.053
This is a nice shortcut
in Angular that I can use

145
00:07:32.053 --> 00:07:35.416
an input to receive a value from the URL.

146
00:07:35.416 --> 00:07:39.454
Because you usually use inputs to
receive value from other components.

147
00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:44.241
But Angular also has the feature that
I can use the Input to receive a value

148
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:45.036
from a URL.

149
00:07:45.036 --> 00:07:52.104
Okay, this.productId equals value, because
I'm saying whatever the id was set to,

150
00:07:52.104 --> 00:07:58.707
pass it into this function as a value,
all right, and then store to my productid.

151
00:07:58.707 --> 00:08:03.185
But if you want to be able to
take advantage of this feature,

152
00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:08.932
if you wanna use this, you have to use
with component input binding, okay?

153
00:08:08.932 --> 00:08:13.842
You have to use this feature to make
that from the URL down to the input.

154
00:08:13.842 --> 00:08:14.970
To make that link,

155
00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:19.712
you've got to enable it cuz you might
not want that, is my whole point, right?

156
00:08:19.712 --> 00:08:21.022
You might not want it.

157
00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:22.637
But if you do want it, this is a nice way.

158
00:08:22.637 --> 00:08:25.187
So the way you used to have to do this.

159
00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:26.947
Anybody ever use Angular before in here?

160
00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:28.507
Anybody ever write any Angular code?

161
00:08:28.507 --> 00:08:32.882
Okay, so you might have been like,
what happened to the activated route?

162
00:08:32.882 --> 00:08:37.610
Where is my get parameters dot map dot,
dot, dot, dot, dot?

163
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:38.283
Where's all that kind of stuff?

164
00:08:38.283 --> 00:08:41.157
This is a different way
to do that same thing.

165
00:08:41.157 --> 00:08:41.949
This is nice.

166
00:08:41.949 --> 00:08:43.444
This is nice and clean.
