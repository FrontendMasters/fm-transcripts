1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.876
So we left off talking about inputs and
outputs.

2
00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:07.053
Inputs let us send information
into a component, and

3
00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:10.380
outputs are the way to send
events out of the component.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.770
But both of those things,
both are about the communication story,

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.560
communicating with your components.

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.846
So let's jump into an actual
example fresh, just right now.

7
00:00:21.846 --> 00:00:26.256
Let's get this next young example,
06-inputs-and-outputs.

8
00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:29.056
So I go back to my code,
close up my previous example,

9
00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:30.566
let me just clean up behind.

10
00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:36.716
We'll clear this right up,
and then I wanna go into 06.

11
00:00:38.356 --> 00:00:41.809
Now, this one's a little beefy,
this is a beefy example.

12
00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:47.457
So here's what we're gonna do.

13
00:00:47.457 --> 00:00:49.377
So yeah, this is an input,
output and a recap.

14
00:00:49.377 --> 00:00:50.461
So with this example,

15
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.167
we're gonna be leveraging all
the tools that you've learned so far.

16
00:00:54.167 --> 00:00:59.137
So you learned how to do interpolation,
you learned composition, you've learned

17
00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:03.692
at a high level binding, that's okay,
and we learned some event handling.

18
00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:09.432
So we're gonna do a lot of that stuff,
yeah, it's all good.

19
00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:11.782
This one's a little beefy,
we're gonna work on it together, though.

20
00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:16.040
Don't double-click these files,
just single-click, if you double-click,

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.572
it takes you to the edit mode.

22
00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:19.537
All right, we're gonna start it up.

23
00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:21.997
06, we're in a 06 example.

24
00:01:24.393 --> 00:01:26.990
Okay, so now we've got our saved cars.

25
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.010
Let's make sure this is our example.

26
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.150
I'm pretty sure this is our example.

27
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.597
Okay, so we've got a bunch of stuff
in here, a bunch of stuff, and

28
00:01:33.597 --> 00:01:35.150
we're gonna get it cooking.

29
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.439
All right, so
we're gonna continue our listing example,

30
00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.899
because I hinted earlier that there's
a better way for us to do this example.

31
00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.680
There's just a better way because we had
so much HTML that was being repeated with

32
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.869
that for loop, but it felt like,
can we organize our code better?

33
00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.499
Well, that's a part of this activity,
right?

34
00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:56.252
We're gonna communicate with our
components and do all kinda stuff.

35
00:01:56.252 --> 00:02:01.387
So first, the idea to start
with is to move our component

36
00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:06.088
template structure to
the ListingComponent, and

37
00:02:06.088 --> 00:02:09.709
that's in listing.component.ts.

38
00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.883
So that's where you start, and
then we'll add input, so we can

39
00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:18.694
communicate into the ListingComponent,
and then we'll reference it.

40
00:02:18.694 --> 00:02:22.778
So I'll give you just a minute so
you just kinda start the first steps.

41
00:02:22.778 --> 00:02:26.950
Start with the first step of
just doing the step number one.

42
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.370
Let's knock that out, and let me go ahead.

43
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.797
And I'll do it with you, But
we're gonna start with our first step.

44
00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:43.670
All right, so line 10 is where you should
start from, you're gonna do your copy.

45
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.667
I marked it out so

46
00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:49.610
we don't waste time or lose time on
trying to figure out what to copy, okay?

47
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.360
So I marked it out for you,
[LAUGH] not marked it, no pun intended.

48
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.744
All right, so I'm gonna move
that right out of there, okay?

49
00:02:58.744 --> 00:03:02.956
And then I'm gonna go
into src &gt; app &gt; listing

50
00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:07.982
&gt; listing.component, and
I left you another hit.

51
00:03:07.982 --> 00:03:11.299
This is like, wasn't one of these you
breadcrumbs because they want you to find

52
00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.152
your way home.

53
00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:15.659
I want you to find your way to success on
this component and with this activity, so

54
00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:16.962
I left you some breadcrumbs.

55
00:03:18.772 --> 00:03:22.429
Okay, so then I'm gonna delete the stuff
that's in there and I'm just gonna make

56
00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.301
some space, and then in my space
I'm gonna put what we just had.

57
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.941
Okay, it looks good,
sounds good, sounds good.

58
00:03:29.941 --> 00:03:31.851
So let's see what should happen here.

59
00:03:31.851 --> 00:03:34.831
All right, so I'm moving a little fast,
let me slow down a little bit.

60
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:38.420
All right, so I'm in listing.component, so

61
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.380
everyone can know we're in
06-input-output listing.component.ts.

62
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.546
I've just moved in the article
element of class listing,

63
00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:52.190
and I moved it into that file.

64
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.139
So I'm gonna save this, and
then I'm gonna save my app.component and

65
00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.548
I'm gonna go back.

66
00:03:58.548 --> 00:04:02.982
And this is what I expect to see is
nothing, because I haven't done,

67
00:04:02.982 --> 00:04:04.214
what am I missing?

68
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.664
&gt;&gt; You haven't put the reference to
it back in the original template.

69
00:04:11.664 --> 00:04:15.444
&gt;&gt; That's right, I did the import and I
didn't make the reference, exactly right,

70
00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:16.917
those are my two steps.

71
00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:18.476
So, let's make that happen.

72
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.789
So, first thing I do,

73
00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.405
I import my ListingComponent cuz I gotta
make it available in the file, and

74
00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:34.261
because it now is a dependency of our
components, we do imports array, okay?

75
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:38.720
There you go, so
add it into your imports array.

76
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.405
Okay, now, the last step,
if I just do app-, and

77
00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:45.892
then it'll tell me what's available for
me in my namespace right now.

78
00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:49.252
Okay, so it knows that about
the import sort of the app listing.

79
00:04:49.252 --> 00:04:53.736
So now if I do that,
save that up, and refresh,

80
00:04:53.736 --> 00:04:56.886
now we're back to where we were.

81
00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:03.050
Okay, now we're back to where we were.

82
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.708
And if we want,
if you wanna have some fun now, I think,

83
00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:08.170
let's see what order I
actually do this in.

84
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.740
Okay, you could add the input here.

85
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.436
Yeah, so we can add the input, because
there are two steps you can do here, but

86
00:05:14.436 --> 00:05:16.340
it might just be easier to do it one step.

87
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.870
Let's do it one step at a time,
and we'll create our input.

88
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.894
Now our input is a decorator,
so we gotta go up to line 1,

89
00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:31.102
and let me slow down,
in listing.component.ts, going to line 1.

90
00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:33.927
I'm also gonna import input.

91
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:43.664
So if you did this and you added a second
line and you just did input here.

92
00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:50.609
And did from Angular core,
that is also fine, right?

93
00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:53.918
You could do it this way, but
if I'm reviewing your code, I'll say, hey,

94
00:05:53.918 --> 00:05:55.849
combine those inputs, right?

95
00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:56.879
So I just combined them.

96
00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.646
Yeah, all right, so let's mark,
I wanna close this for a second.

97
00:06:02.646 --> 00:06:04.919
Let's just kinda close
these we're not using,

98
00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.336
just to keep our focus
in the right places.

99
00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:11.316
So we need to have an input,
what should it be called?

100
00:06:11.316 --> 00:06:12.497
What should our input be called?

101
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.276
Anybody remember from the readme?

102
00:06:22.113 --> 00:06:25.053
So we've got @Input,
don't forget your parentheses,

103
00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:27.274
and then what's the name of this property?

104
00:06:27.274 --> 00:06:29.606
&gt;&gt; Car.
&gt;&gt; Car, there you go, car, good.

105
00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:30.870
Good, good, good.

106
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.660
car, and what type should it be?

107
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.390
&gt;&gt; Car.

108
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.273
&gt;&gt; Of type capital Car,
right, that's the type.

109
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.456
Okay, so
you're gonna run into something here.

110
00:06:41.456 --> 00:06:45.454
So input called car, don't forget
to import the Input decorator, but

111
00:06:45.454 --> 00:06:47.532
guess what you're gonna have to do?

112
00:06:49.368 --> 00:06:51.554
TypeScript is gonna complain.

113
00:06:51.554 --> 00:06:55.176
So if I save this, it's going to complain.

114
00:06:55.176 --> 00:06:57.555
Let me tell you why.

115
00:06:57.555 --> 00:07:03.279
Because car has no initializer, meaning,
what's the value of this car right now?

116
00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.119
Currently in this component,
what's the value of the car?

117
00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:09.339
&gt;&gt; Undefined.

118
00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:13.297
&gt;&gt; Undefined, so
if I access any of the properties on it,

119
00:07:13.297 --> 00:07:15.519
it's gonna throw an error.

120
00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:18.495
So TypeScript, even though this
feels annoying, because you're like,

121
00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:19.818
I'm in the middle of something,

122
00:07:19.818 --> 00:07:22.244
let me finish what I'm doing
before you start complaining.

123
00:07:22.244 --> 00:07:26.268
It's letting you know right off the bat,
look, you have not given this an initial

124
00:07:26.268 --> 00:07:29.590
value, and I don't know that I'm
going to get an initial value, so

125
00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.302
I'm gonna throw an error, okay?

126
00:07:31.302 --> 00:07:35.150
So we can do one of two things,
we can say that we know for

127
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.690
sure it won't be undefined, or
we can give it an initial value.

128
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.777
We're gonna go the former, okay?

129
00:07:42.777 --> 00:07:47.014
We're gonna tell it for sure,
it won't be undefined, and

130
00:07:47.014 --> 00:07:49.740
we have the exclamation point, car!

131
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:54.735
[LAUGH] No, that's called the non-null
assertion operator, okay?

132
00:07:54.735 --> 00:07:58.204
I know super long name, let's call
it the non-null assertion operator.

133
00:07:58.204 --> 00:08:03.117
So I'm telling TypeScript, fam,
chill out, it is gonna be fine,

134
00:08:03.117 --> 00:08:06.411
I'm going to handle this, okay?

135
00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:07.261
Don't you worry about it.

136
00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:11.151
But we can also get a little
bit more busy here if we want.

137
00:08:11.151 --> 00:08:16.268
Now I didn't put this in the instructions
cuz this is not super, it's not mandatory,

138
00:08:16.268 --> 00:08:20.491
but I can also help my developers
who may consume my component, right?

139
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:23.687
Because maybe I'm on a different team,
right, and I'm making my component and

140
00:08:23.687 --> 00:08:25.922
I was like, you use it when I'm done.

141
00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:26.622
I can help them out.

142
00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:32.542
I can also say required: equals
true in the input decorator.

143
00:08:32.542 --> 00:08:37.284
So now Angular will kind of throw
a fit if you don't provide it, so

144
00:08:37.284 --> 00:08:40.142
that way people can just know, right?

145
00:08:40.142 --> 00:08:44.605
It'll know like, hey, this is a required
component and you did not provide it, bro,

146
00:08:44.605 --> 00:08:45.661
what are you doing?

147
00:08:45.661 --> 00:08:47.291
You're trying to break your own app?

148
00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:49.569
Yes, I am, thank you.

149
00:08:49.569 --> 00:08:52.080
All right, okay, so now we have our input.

150
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.820
That required part is optional,
you don't have to put that, but

151
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.969
it's a nice thing to do if you need
it to render your application, okay?

152
00:08:59.969 --> 00:09:02.272
Now, we added our reference.

153
00:09:02.272 --> 00:09:08.789
Okay, so now we got to use our listing
component via the selector, that's right.

154
00:09:11.562 --> 00:09:13.515
So we're there, but guess what?

155
00:09:16.693 --> 00:09:19.669
As my son would say, ya-ta-ta,
all right, it's like,

156
00:09:19.669 --> 00:09:24.264
what's happening here, that's how he draws
attention to stuff, he goes, ya-ta-ta.

157
00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:28.614
All right, it's telling me it's required,
which is helpful to me as a developer,

158
00:09:28.614 --> 00:09:32.370
because maybe I didn't write this
component, maybe another team did.

159
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.176
Now I know what I need to provide,
so I need to provide a car.

160
00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:37.690
But let's make sure we're going in order.

161
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.508
Okay, we did our reference there,

162
00:09:39.508 --> 00:09:43.465
okay, and then we're gonna list,
aha, so now I get to number four.

163
00:09:43.465 --> 00:09:45.063
So we did the first two parts, right?

164
00:09:45.063 --> 00:09:51.265
We added to the imports, we already moved
the template, now we have our input.

165
00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:58.725
And now it wants us to pass
a reference car to the input.

166
00:09:58.725 --> 00:10:01.837
So this one sounds a little tricky,
let's make sure we understand the parts.

167
00:10:01.837 --> 00:10:03.467
First thing we've gotta do is iterate.

168
00:10:03.467 --> 00:10:05.849
How do you iterate over
something in a template?

169
00:10:08.076 --> 00:10:08.633
&gt;&gt; For loop.

170
00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:10.556
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for, a for loop.

171
00:10:10.556 --> 00:10:14.446
So we'll say, let car,
maybe, of what list?

172
00:10:19.947 --> 00:10:21.802
Somebody yell it out for me.

173
00:10:21.802 --> 00:10:23.501
&gt;&gt; carList.
&gt;&gt; carList, nice, thank you,

174
00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:24.342
I appreciate that.

175
00:10:25.402 --> 00:10:27.042
Then I gotta bring in my track.

176
00:10:28.092 --> 00:10:29.392
Did I get these cars with id?

177
00:10:29.392 --> 00:10:31.312
Nope, it's okay, we could track by car.

178
00:10:33.112 --> 00:10:36.752
And then we'll just, okay,
so now we're pretty close.

179
00:10:36.752 --> 00:10:38.202
Okay, let me stop right there.

180
00:10:38.202 --> 00:10:41.415
So now we have a for
loop iterating over our carList.

181
00:10:41.415 --> 00:10:46.595
Fantastic, now, we gotta pass in a car.

182
00:10:46.595 --> 00:10:51.892
How do we send information
in to our component?

183
00:10:51.892 --> 00:10:53.635
&gt;&gt; An attribute.

184
00:10:53.635 --> 00:10:55.005
&gt;&gt; Which one?
What's the name of it?

185
00:10:55.005 --> 00:10:56.945
What type is it called?

186
00:10:56.945 --> 00:11:01.422
It begins with an I and
rhymes with send put.

187
00:11:01.422 --> 00:11:04.617
&gt;&gt; Input?
&gt;&gt; Input, yeah, okay, there you go.

188
00:11:04.617 --> 00:11:08.008
All right, so the input here,
it'll tell you,

189
00:11:08.008 --> 00:11:13.007
you see the first property there,
I did a control space there.

190
00:11:13.007 --> 00:11:17.599
And it's telling me this requires, so
these are all things we could bind to if

191
00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:20.936
we wanted to, but
you really need to bind to car, okay?

192
00:11:20.936 --> 00:11:22.618
And do we have a car to send it?

193
00:11:22.618 --> 00:11:23.556
We do.

194
00:11:23.556 --> 00:11:28.120
Now that can look a little tricky, if you
read that, that looks a little tricky.

195
00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:32.596
So let's just make a slight
modification here.

196
00:11:36.678 --> 00:11:40.853
I would even go so
far as to write carEntry instead,

197
00:11:40.853 --> 00:11:46.402
to make it more clear which is which,
that makes it just more clear.

198
00:11:49.248 --> 00:11:53.760
So we get a car entry, which is what
it is, from the collection carList, and

199
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:57.709
then there's a property called
car on the app listing component,

200
00:11:57.709 --> 00:12:02.586
the ListingComponent, and we're giving
it a carEntry as the value there.

201
00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:08.838
Now, if I take off these brackets,
You see,

202
00:12:08.838 --> 00:12:11.906
it tells me,
cuz remember I said without the brackets,

203
00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:14.896
it thinks everything's a string,
and now we see.

204
00:12:14.896 --> 00:12:17.436
So here's where TypeScript
comes into play.

205
00:12:17.436 --> 00:12:19.868
This is all TypeScript,
this isn't Angular being Angular,

206
00:12:19.868 --> 00:12:21.731
this is TypeScript being TypeScript.

207
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:25.935
TypeScript is telling me, you told me,
this was your words, right,

208
00:12:25.935 --> 00:12:29.551
as a developer,
you said that the input was of type car.

209
00:12:29.551 --> 00:12:31.721
That's what you said, agree or disagree?

210
00:12:31.721 --> 00:12:32.721
Yeah, I said that.

211
00:12:32.721 --> 00:12:34.763
Okay, cool,
then why are you giving me a string?

212
00:12:37.018 --> 00:12:40.719
You see, so
TypeScript is just working in our favor.

213
00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:45.213
Okay, so I'm gonna switch it back
to a property binding, which means

214
00:12:45.213 --> 00:12:50.025
the thing on the right-hand side now
becomes an actual property, right?

215
00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:53.585
It's like a value now, and it's the value
from thing, okay, so we got that.

216
00:12:53.585 --> 00:12:55.775
So we're cooking right now,
we're really cooking.

217
00:12:55.775 --> 00:12:58.569
So if we go back to,
if we save everything, go back,

218
00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.475
our refresh page with too big font.

219
00:13:01.967 --> 00:13:04.844
Yeah, it's too big, I could probably
fix this flex dial or something,

220
00:13:04.844 --> 00:13:08.067
we gotta fix that to a column or something
that looks bad, we gotta do something.

221
00:13:09.387 --> 00:13:10.887
Let's see if we can fix it.

222
00:13:10.887 --> 00:13:14.887
Oop, ain't no styles,
ain't no styles when they're gone.

223
00:13:18.367 --> 00:13:20.503
I'm sorry, I paused,
that's what I was singing.

224
00:13:20.503 --> 00:13:22.462
All right, let's see,
can we change our style?

225
00:13:22.462 --> 00:13:23.943
[LAUGH] No styles there either.

226
00:13:23.943 --> 00:13:27.330
I think all the styles are global for
this one, so that's why it's all.

227
00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.033
We can work on the styles later,
the styles are not important.

228
00:13:30.033 --> 00:13:33.869
All right, so now we got everything
that we need, we got this part, so

229
00:13:33.869 --> 00:13:35.502
now we're gonna use output.

230
00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:38.702
Let's see, well, first,
before we finish that,

231
00:13:38.702 --> 00:13:43.111
let's make sure that we got all
of our listing component details.

232
00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:44.491
Okay, we can do this quickly.

233
00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:47.671
So I'm back in listing,
let me slow down for a second.

234
00:13:47.671 --> 00:13:51.075
Back in listing.component.ts,
we're gonna fill in the details so

235
00:13:51.075 --> 00:13:54.374
that way we can tell that our car
is actually being passed in, okay?

236
00:13:54.374 --> 00:13:57.106
So we're gonna just take this and
we're gonna do this quickly.

237
00:13:57.106 --> 00:13:58.518
I'm not gonna talk too much through it.

238
00:13:58.518 --> 00:14:03.444
So we got a car.model,
something like that, and

239
00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:08.502
then car.make, yeah,
there we go, car.make.

240
00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:10.175
Okay, sounds good.

241
00:14:10.175 --> 00:14:15.063
All right, friends at home, I'm just
filling in the properties, don't worry.

242
00:14:15.063 --> 00:14:19.989
You get car., what was that,
year, okay, got it.

243
00:14:25.598 --> 00:14:26.857
That's gonna be stuck in my head.

244
00:14:26.857 --> 00:14:27.887
Okay, great, thanks, Mark.

245
00:14:29.155 --> 00:14:31.289
We don't have transmission,
we'll put something else here,

246
00:14:31.289 --> 00:14:32.407
we'll put anything else here.

247
00:14:32.407 --> 00:14:34.189
Let's put a price for

248
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:40.057
now cuz I still wanna spend the time
to fix that for now, all right.

249
00:14:40.057 --> 00:14:45.610
Wait, here, I know what we can do,
we'll say that all are automatic, right?

250
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:49.450
You just do that,
just take out that property binding and

251
00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.782
say they're all automatic, and
then it's fine, it's fine.

252
00:14:56.781 --> 00:15:00.877
You get car.miles, okay,
cool, and then car.price.

253
00:15:00.877 --> 00:15:04.972
Very fun, we're cooking,
we are cooking with gas.

254
00:15:04.972 --> 00:15:07.427
All right, car.price, let's go.

255
00:15:07.427 --> 00:15:15.337
If I save this, I should have all my
properties filled in in our listings.

256
00:15:15.337 --> 00:15:17.897
And we're good,
we're back to where we wanna be, right?

257
00:15:17.897 --> 00:15:19.667
We're good, we got the properties.

258
00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:27.001
And what's great about this is if we go to
app.component.ts, look how clean that is.

259
00:15:27.001 --> 00:15:29.009
Look how clean that is.

260
00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:31.349
Wait, sorry, all the highlighting.

261
00:15:31.349 --> 00:15:36.059
Okay, you see the carEntry is
a single car from our list.

262
00:15:36.059 --> 00:15:38.727
Then we have a component that we say

263
00:15:38.727 --> 00:15:43.512
fill in the values with the provided
variable that I give you.

264
00:15:43.512 --> 00:15:46.401
Fine, carEntry, and then we're good to go.
