1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.701
Now, let's do this last part.

2
00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:04.965
Let's do this last part.

3
00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:06.143
We gotta use outputs.

4
00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:07.282
This part can be a little tricky.

5
00:00:07.282 --> 00:00:12.097
Cuz here's what we wanna do,
we wanna add a button,

6
00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:16.376
so that way,
you see the Saved Cars at the top?

7
00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:21.667
I wanna be able to save a car,
and then it show up in that list.

8
00:00:24.816 --> 00:00:26.320
Okay, I wanna be able to save a car.

9
00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.786
Okay, now, saving a car,
let's say it was an event maybe, right?

10
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.715
We can call it an event,
like you're doing something, an action.

11
00:00:38.715 --> 00:00:44.066
So we're gonna use an output for
that, use an output.

12
00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:45.705
But where does that output go?

13
00:00:45.705 --> 00:00:48.742
That's the question, right,
to help us track best.

14
00:00:48.742 --> 00:00:51.161
Where does that output go?

15
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:53.178
It goes into the listing component.

16
00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.688
Because we wanna go from that component,

17
00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.997
send the event back up to
our parent component, okay?

18
00:01:02.508 --> 00:01:07.519
So now, let's first import output.

19
00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:09.716
First thing we gotta do,
we gotta import it.

20
00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:11.016
We gotta import one more class.

21
00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:13.987
Anybody know the other
class we have to import?

22
00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:16.282
Yell it out if you know it, safe space.

23
00:01:16.282 --> 00:01:17.414
&gt;&gt; The event emitter?

24
00:01:17.414 --> 00:01:19.378
&gt;&gt; The event emitter, thank you.

25
00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:21.413
Awesome, very awesome.

26
00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.879
Okay, so now we got an event emitter.

27
00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:27.262
So what is the name of our output,
do we know?

28
00:01:33.498 --> 00:01:35.873
It's all good, we can get it from here.

29
00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:38.586
carSaved, yeah, that's the one.

30
00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:42.606
Okay, we have carSaved.

31
00:01:42.606 --> 00:01:49.708
And then I think we agree that it's
going to emit the current car.

32
00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:53.158
Okay, this is a little
bit of a trickiness here.

33
00:01:53.158 --> 00:01:57.516
Okay, a little trickiness for
us to kinda sort out, okay?

34
00:01:57.516 --> 00:02:01.934
We want it to be a new EventEmitter.

35
00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:08.841
And if I don't do this, the type that it
will emit, let's see what TypeScript says.

36
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:13.353
It says it's gonna emit an any,
which means any type can match.

37
00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:16.753
That doesn't help us, though,
because we know what type it's gonna be.

38
00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:18.206
What type is it gonna be?

39
00:02:19.413 --> 00:02:20.010
&gt;&gt; Car.

40
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.995
&gt;&gt; A car.

41
00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:24.547
So let's use our generic syntax.

42
00:02:24.547 --> 00:02:28.323
I know my Java developers see that
little syntax and get so happy,

43
00:02:28.323 --> 00:02:30.256
they see them generics in there.

44
00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:32.676
I remember when I used
to write Java code and

45
00:02:32.676 --> 00:02:35.634
I remember the book that was
like the level up bible,

46
00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:39.215
this is the book you wrote and
you read if you wanted to level up.

47
00:02:39.215 --> 00:02:42.775
It was called Effective Java
by Joshua Block, and

48
00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:46.606
I remember just how much
that book changed my career.

49
00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:48.085
Two books changed my career.

50
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.833
I can tell you this for everybody at
home if you're trying to level up,

51
00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:52.005
two books changed my career.

52
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:56.001
When I was a Java developer, at the time
Effective Java was the most advanced

53
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:59.820
Java book you could buy that could
change the way you thought about Java.

54
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.687
The second book was
You Don't Know JavaScript by Kyle Simpson.

55
00:03:03.687 --> 00:03:06.742
Because I thought I knew JavaScript and
I read that book and I was like, damn,

56
00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:07.830
I don't know JavaScript.

57
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.085
I actually don't know, and
that's a fantastic series.

58
00:03:11.085 --> 00:03:14.047
You Don't Know JavaScript by Kyle Simpson,
fantastic book.

59
00:03:14.047 --> 00:03:15.361
Two books that improved my career.

60
00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.907
Okay, that's the free one for you all to
go ahead and keep in your memory banks.

61
00:03:18.907 --> 00:03:22.819
And open source that book, so
you can go read it too for free.

62
00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:23.839
Man, look at that.

63
00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:28.507
&gt;&gt; And he has Deep Foundations of
JavaScript on Frontend Masters.

64
00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.753
&gt;&gt; Now, if you watching this-
&gt;&gt; They're going through the book.

65
00:03:33.753 --> 00:03:37.712
&gt;&gt; If you watching this,
when you finish, go watch that one, and

66
00:03:37.712 --> 00:03:39.890
then just become an extra genius.

67
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.044
You're like, 2X genius.

68
00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:44.567
Okay, but let's keep it going, so
now we have our event emitter, and

69
00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:47.218
let's actually do the button,
we need our button.

70
00:03:47.218 --> 00:03:48.969
So if we add a button here.

71
00:03:51.056 --> 00:03:52.084
Where did I say to put it?

72
00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:54.613
Did I say to put it inside the article or
outside?

73
00:03:54.613 --> 00:03:58.151
You can add it outside, it's fine.

74
00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:02.585
So enlisting.component.ts, at the bottom,
I'm just gonna add a button.

75
00:04:05.058 --> 00:04:09.504
And we can say Save, or you could say Add
to Favorites if you want, or Add to Saved,

76
00:04:09.504 --> 00:04:13.132
you can do whatever you want,
the label doesn't matter, right?

77
00:04:13.132 --> 00:04:16.658
So we'll say Save Car, okay.

78
00:04:16.658 --> 00:04:21.718
I want to respond to
clicking of this button,

79
00:04:21.718 --> 00:04:24.520
what do I need to do here?

80
00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.414
Just tell me the idea, and
we'll work on the syntax together.

81
00:04:28.414 --> 00:04:32.673
What's the idea that I need, if I wanna
respond to someone clicking this button?

82
00:04:34.402 --> 00:04:35.952
&gt;&gt; You need a listener.

83
00:04:35.952 --> 00:04:40.036
&gt;&gt; I need a listener,
right, that is spot on.

84
00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:44.610
So the one I wanna respond to was click,
right?

85
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.435
Somebody clicks on it, I wanna just
respond like that, and then it's giving me

86
00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:52.166
some help and letting me know to put the
parentheses around so I can bind to it.

87
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:55.853
Now I need an event handler,
so I need to do like handle,

88
00:04:55.853 --> 00:05:00.569
I wanna make sure I follow our directions,
or handleCarSaved, okay?

89
00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:03.724
I wanna make sure I follow
our directions here.

90
00:05:03.724 --> 00:05:07.150
All right, handleCarSaved,
put your parentheses there.

91
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.738
It's saying this doesn't exist,
so let's bring it into existence.

92
00:05:10.738 --> 00:05:12.082
Sorry, lemme slow down a little bit.

93
00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:17.737
So I just added my button, got my click,
now I have my event handler.

94
00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:22.675
All right, so we're gonna make it.

95
00:05:27.005 --> 00:05:30.511
You haven't done this yet, so
let me walk through this with you.

96
00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.911
CarSaved is a property on
the listing component class.

97
00:05:37.911 --> 00:05:40.734
Agree, disagree, give me a thumbs
up if you agree it's a property?

98
00:05:42.704 --> 00:05:43.651
You don't agree?

99
00:05:43.651 --> 00:05:45.860
Okay, let's get that together then.

100
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:52.434
So I got my listing component class,
okay, and then I define carSaved here.

101
00:05:52.434 --> 00:05:55.825
So that makes it a property of my class.

102
00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.729
Why is that important, that it's
a property and not just a variable?

103
00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.780
It's how we reference it changes, okay?

104
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.522
So now I have to use the this keyword,
And say this.carSaved.

105
00:06:12.522 --> 00:06:16.972
Cuz if you type carSaved, it's gonna look
in the local scope of this function and

106
00:06:16.972 --> 00:06:19.532
be like,
there is no carSaved property here.

107
00:06:19.532 --> 00:06:20.990
All right, I don't know about this.

108
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.213
Okay, this.carSaved, okay?

109
00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:27.235
Then .emit.

110
00:06:35.982 --> 00:06:38.159
Submit the car.

111
00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:41.537
We can't just do car, we gotta do what?

112
00:06:41.537 --> 00:06:43.008
This.car.

113
00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.741
If the this keyword is messing you up,
I have something for you.

114
00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:53.984
Check out This is Ridiculous
on YouTube by Mark Techson.

115
00:06:53.984 --> 00:06:58.393
Seriously, I have a whole
talk where I break down

116
00:06:58.393 --> 00:07:03.454
the mysteries of the this keyword And

117
00:07:03.454 --> 00:07:08.751
I introduce what I call the Beyonce rule,
cuz she has a song called To the Left,

118
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:13.346
to the left, to the left,
everything you own in the box of the left.

119
00:07:13.346 --> 00:07:14.704
Where is this car coming from?

120
00:07:14.704 --> 00:07:15.468
Check to the left.

121
00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:17.330
If there's something to the left,

122
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.381
that is the origin of the property
you're talking about.

123
00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:22.957
So if I look to the left of carSaved,
what is it then?

124
00:07:22.957 --> 00:07:26.691
This, and this and
this turns is the class.

125
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.294
If there was nothing there,
it'd be like the global scope.

126
00:07:29.294 --> 00:07:31.295
And we have a whole talk about that,
right?

127
00:07:31.295 --> 00:07:34.228
So you can finally learn it and
then be the genius in your workplace,

128
00:07:34.228 --> 00:07:36.451
be like, yeah,
I know how to solve this problems.

129
00:07:36.451 --> 00:07:38.927
All right, so
we got everything that we need.

130
00:07:38.927 --> 00:07:40.743
[LAUGH] I'm cooking, don't laugh at me,
you'll make me act worse.

131
00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:43.524
All right, nobody laugh at my jokes,
I will act worse.
