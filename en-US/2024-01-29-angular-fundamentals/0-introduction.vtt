00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.158
All right, everyone, welcome to this
course Angular Fundamentals with your

2
00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:05.425
host, Mark Thompson.

3
00:00:05.425 --> 00:00:07.084
I am so thrilled to be here.

4
00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:10.068
And I'm so glad that you're
joining us in-person and online.

5
00:00:10.068 --> 00:00:12.961
And if you're watching this at
a future time, I'll say this,

6
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.926
welcome to the party, we're so
glad that you're here as well.

7
00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:20.074
Okay, friends, I said Mark Thomson,
but I also go by Mark Techson,

8
00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:24.241
this is my celebrity name, so
that you all can always find me online.

9
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.988
So if you ever Google Mark Techson,
I'll always pop up,

10
00:00:27.988 --> 00:00:30.339
because my wife is smarter than me.

11
00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.676
She came up with that name, and
it is just such a great way to do this.

12
00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:37.150
All right, so Angular Fundamentals.

13
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.594
Here's what I want you to understand,
what's gonna happen today.

14
00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:41.452
Here's what I want you to expect,
all right?

15
00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:46.164
So by the end of this time together,
you're gonna understand the fundamentals

16
00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:48.988
of Angular and
be able to build an application.

17
00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:51.307
But you may be asking yourself,
well, Mark,

18
00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:53.458
what does it mean to build an application?

19
00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:55.788
What about all the things
that Angular can do?

20
00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:59.740
Well, with any technology, no matter
whether it be Angular or some other

21
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.330
front-end framework or other tool, there's
a just really broad range of topics and

22
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.539
a lot of depth that you can go into.

23
00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:09.515
But before you get there,
before you need those things,

24
00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:13.297
I believe that these we'll cover today
are what you need to get started,

25
00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:16.340
and you'll be able to get going and
build something cool.

26
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.587
Let's talk about the takeaways,

27
00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:19.831
the things that I want you to
take away from our time together.

28
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:22.499
So, you'll definitely
learn about components,

29
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:25.545
which are a big part of any
front-end framework, right?

30
00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:28.673
The components are just one of the major
building blocks, we will learn about that.

31
00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:30.225
We'll learn how to add routing.

32
00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:33.586
You really can't get through an
application these days without routing and

33
00:01:33.586 --> 00:01:35.330
navigating through the application.

34
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.640
We'll capture user input forms,

35
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.391
another fundamental part
of building an application.

36
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:44.434
Angular has something very special and
we call it dependency injection.

37
00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:48.910
Now, if you've ever done any back end
programming, you've heard of this before,

38
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:52.440
but on the front end, we really
don't use dependency injection or

39
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.109
Aspect Oriented Programming,
stuff like that.

40
00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.474
You don't really use that type of stuff,
except for

41
00:01:57.474 --> 00:02:01.102
Angular leverages a special power, and
we'll get some time with that as well.

42
00:02:01.102 --> 00:02:04.268
I'll even teach you some quick
optimizations, and I can already read your

43
00:02:04.268 --> 00:02:06.844
minds, I know where you are right
now at home, I can feel it.

44
00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:10.353
People in the room are like, why did you
teach us to optimize in the beginning?

45
00:02:10.353 --> 00:02:12.806
Okay, you really optimize
after you've measured, and

46
00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:15.118
you know that there are things
that you can do better.

47
00:02:15.118 --> 00:02:18.812
But I'll show you some things that you can
include from the beginning that will help

48
00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:19.931
you along that process.

49
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:22.272
So this isn't pre-optimization,

50
00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:26.128
this is just what can you do right
now to keep the party going?

51
00:02:26.128 --> 00:02:28.821
All right, a little bit about me,
I introduce myself,

52
00:02:28.821 --> 00:02:31.014
my name is Mark as I said,
and I'm all right.

53
00:02:31.014 --> 00:02:32.170
All right, I'm cool.

54
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.408
Okay, fine, that's fine.

55
00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:37.302
No, but seriously [LAUGH] all right,
this is a true story about me.

56
00:02:37.302 --> 00:02:40.368
All right, I'm an award winning university
instructor after I've taught at

57
00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:42.553
universities such as Harvard,
Northwestern, UCLA,

58
00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:43.821
I've taught at a lot of places.

59
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:46.349
And I was fortunate enough to win an
award, the students liked me enough that

60
00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.896
they're like, hey, this guy's great,
and we'd like to honor his work.

61
00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:50.219
So, I appreciate that.

62
00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.312
Currently, I'm an engineer at Google,
I work on the Angular team.

63
00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:55.593
And then,
here's something that I do by myself.

64
00:02:55.593 --> 00:02:58.124
This whole time that I've been
with the team at Frontend Masters,

65
00:02:58.124 --> 00:03:00.299
I've been asking about all the gear and
all the cameras.

66
00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.151
Because I love videography as a hobby,
and one of my favorite things to do,

67
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:09.243
literally, is for you to invite
me to your party or something.

68
00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:13.292
And then, I'll show up with my camera and
document the whole thing for you, and

69
00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:14.570
create a story as a gift.

70
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.737
But, you cannot pay me to do this,
because then it's no longer fun for me.

71
00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:19.332
So I like to do it as a gift for people.

72
00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:22.816
And I love video games, and I love to
play guitar, I've been playing guitar for

73
00:03:22.816 --> 00:03:23.703
almost 20 years.

74
00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:27.773
And I'm okay guitar player,
because I'm not famous for guitar,

75
00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:30.107
so you can tell I'm okay, all right.

76
00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:35.131
All right, now, about this course,
here's how we'll do it, all right?

77
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:39.085
The way I teach, we'll discuss the topic,
I'll go over the syntax,

78
00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:42.704
I'll go over the ideas, and then,
you also see an example, and

79
00:03:42.704 --> 00:03:45.404
then we'll all do it together, okay?

80
00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:47.864
And you will do some of the activities,
but this is hands-on.

81
00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:49.738
Okay, so I'll be asking for you,

82
00:03:49.738 --> 00:03:52.453
even at home I'll ask you
folks to submit ideas for

83
00:03:52.453 --> 00:03:56.739
what we build and how we do things, cuz I
want you to get some learning by doing.

84
00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:04.465
The most important part to be able to
participate is to have these two links.

85
00:04:04.465 --> 00:04:06.265
All right,
the first link is to the slides.

86
00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:10.404
So if you're at home and you want to be
able to use the slides or see the slides,

87
00:04:10.404 --> 00:04:13.588
just go to this link right now,
you got that one, and then,

88
00:04:13.588 --> 00:04:16.307
if you need the project code, okay?

89
00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:21.832
And you can go to get the project code.

90
00:04:21.832 --> 00:04:22.696
Just at a high level,

91
00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:25.151
here are the things that you need
to be able to do this course.

92
00:04:25.151 --> 00:04:27.583
So if you're watching this
at some point in the future,

93
00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:31.428
you definitely need the latest version of
Node, the Angular CLI, Visual Studio Code.

94
00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:36.720
And then a nice bonus is if you have
the Angular Language Service Plugin,

95
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.206
which allows VS Code to do some nice
ergonomic themes with Angular for you.

96
00:04:44.933 --> 00:04:46.823
Do you a question?

97
00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:48.658
&gt;&gt; Is just a few comments from chatter.

98
00:04:48.658 --> 00:04:50.216
&gt;&gt; Sure, okay.

99
00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:51.966
&gt;&gt; Snaps got me buzzing for real.

100
00:04:53.876 --> 00:04:56.916
What's your favorite
genre to play on guitar?

101
00:04:57.982 --> 00:05:01.346
&gt;&gt; Good question my favorite
genre to play on guitar.

102
00:05:01.346 --> 00:05:02.676
So I love heavy metal.

103
00:05:02.676 --> 00:05:05.840
And so, I've been practicing
heavy metal for, recently,

104
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.036
that's been my big thing recently.

105
00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:12.156
Before that, I used to do a lot of just
alternative, everything from the 90s,

106
00:05:12.156 --> 00:05:15.626
things from the 2000s, but
now I really love heavy metal.

107
00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:17.972
And so, I'm trying to go back
to some of my favorites.

108
00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:21.782
I wanna be able to play Master
of Puppets in six months, right?

109
00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:25.372
I wanna be able to play the whole thing,
even the solo, even the solo.

110
00:05:25.372 --> 00:05:28.882
So if you find me online and I don't
do it, remind me about this moment.

111
00:05:30.192 --> 00:05:32.162
&gt;&gt; I'm inviting Mark to my birthday party.

112
00:05:33.572 --> 00:05:36.272
Mark is invited to my wedding,
said that to Eduardo.

113
00:05:36.272 --> 00:05:40.718
&gt;&gt; All right, if you see me in all black
with a camera, just like, cuz, yeah,

114
00:05:40.718 --> 00:05:42.188
you know what happened.

115
00:05:42.188 --> 00:05:45.112
&gt;&gt; Will we be live
coding in this workshop?

116
00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:49.254
&gt;&gt; You will be live coding, which is why
it's super important to get all of these

117
00:05:49.254 --> 00:05:52.009
things going for
yourself on your local machines.

118
00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.377
Or if you can't get it set up in time and
you want to do it live with me,

119
00:05:56.377 --> 00:06:00.227
you can also go to StackBlitz,
I wish I had the link for you.

120
00:06:00.227 --> 00:06:03.490
But you go to StackBlitz, and
then, you can code online there.

121
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.627
So it'll be pretty close
to what we're doing, right,

122
00:06:05.627 --> 00:06:06.908
if you just wanna type it in live.

123
00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:10.595
But, the best thing to do is to get
all these links that I have listed on

124
00:06:10.595 --> 00:06:11.846
the slides.

125
00:06:11.846 --> 00:06:14.102
All right, so what is Angular?

126
00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:16.924
Angular, at the high level,
this is what we say now, right?

127
00:06:16.924 --> 00:06:23.936
Angular is a web framework used to build
scalable web applications with confidence.

128
00:06:23.936 --> 00:06:27.966
Okay, scalable and confidence are the two
words that I like to call out here.

129
00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:30.463
Because one of the things that people
will say about Angular world that's

130
00:06:30.463 --> 00:06:31.356
an enterprise solution.

131
00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:33.807
But here's what's interesting
about enterprise in general.

132
00:06:33.807 --> 00:06:36.040
You know what enterprise is excellent at?

133
00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.684
Scale, right?

134
00:06:37.684 --> 00:06:41.723
Sometimes it has the wrong definition
of like, enterprise is big and slow.

135
00:06:41.723 --> 00:06:46.081
No, enterprise is great at scale, and
if you build anything in general, for

136
00:06:46.081 --> 00:06:49.606
the most part what you really
care about is scalability.

137
00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:52.886
If I were to build a weekend project
that I want to turn into a startup,

138
00:06:52.886 --> 00:06:54.655
what do I care about in the long term?

139
00:06:54.655 --> 00:06:55.982
Scalability, right?

140
00:06:55.982 --> 00:07:00.901
I want to eventually get to the point
where I can handle thousands of users

141
00:07:00.901 --> 00:07:04.223
requests per minute,
tens of thousands, etc.

142
00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:08.111
And so, what we believe is that
some of the fundamental patterns

143
00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:11.714
in Angular help you to achieve
that vision of scalability.

144
00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:14.037
But here's where
the confidence part comes in.

145
00:07:14.037 --> 00:07:15.901
When we're talking about confidence,

146
00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:19.093
we want you to have confidence in
the framework and in the community.

147
00:07:19.093 --> 00:07:21.162
We say confident in framework,

148
00:07:21.162 --> 00:07:25.542
one of our core tenets is that we try
to bring the web forward with us.

149
00:07:25.542 --> 00:07:28.742
So when we release an update
on the Angular team,

150
00:07:28.742 --> 00:07:34.411
many of our features are actually
non-breaking even with major changes.

151
00:07:34.411 --> 00:07:37.291
We release some new syntax
that we'll cover today.

152
00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:39.707
You can opt into that
syntax when you're ready.

153
00:07:39.707 --> 00:07:42.282
And that is huge for
organizations, because then,

154
00:07:42.282 --> 00:07:46.497
they can take advantage of things like
security updates, other stability updates,

155
00:07:46.497 --> 00:07:49.616
and then they can migrate their
large applications over time.

156
00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:52.635
Because think about this idea, what if
you have an application where let's say,

157
00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:53.565
a million lines of code?

158
00:07:53.565 --> 00:07:55.328
That is not unreasonable for

159
00:07:55.328 --> 00:07:58.932
a large application that's
been built in serving users.

160
00:07:58.932 --> 00:08:03.946
You probably can't migrate to every new
thing every single time, that's fine.

161
00:08:03.946 --> 00:08:06.661
We're here with you on the Angular team,
and

162
00:08:06.661 --> 00:08:11.314
what we do is that we also release tooling
to help you migrate at your own pace.

163
00:08:11.314 --> 00:08:13.148
We do all of this extra work, right,

164
00:08:13.148 --> 00:08:16.004
to continue to give you
the confidence in the framework.

165
00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:19.251
So that's why we say, you can build and
scale with confidence.

166
00:08:19.251 --> 00:08:22.511
Because we're helping you along the way
and we try not to break you, as we go.

167
00:08:24.361 --> 00:08:27.309
What questions can I
answer before I go on?

168
00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:28.477
Sure, questions.

169
00:08:28.477 --> 00:08:31.115
&gt;&gt; What do you mean when you say,
scalability?

170
00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:32.465
&gt;&gt; Sure, two things.

171
00:08:32.465 --> 00:08:34.728
You can scale your applications and
you can scale your teams.

172
00:08:34.728 --> 00:08:39.118
One of the things that Angular developers
usually comment on is the idea that,

173
00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:43.190
when they jump into an Angular code base,
they can get started quickly.

174
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.666
Because of the patterns and

175
00:08:44.666 --> 00:08:47.500
the best practices that we
set out in the beginning.

176
00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:48.623
Angular is opinionated.

177
00:08:49.683 --> 00:08:53.781
We give you a lot of stuff up-front,
for example, the router built-in,

178
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:56.173
you are never searching for a router.

179
00:08:56.173 --> 00:08:57.753
That is just not a part of your story.

180
00:08:57.753 --> 00:09:01.205
Dependency injection, built-in,
we got you on that one.

181
00:09:01.205 --> 00:09:05.144
We even give you an HTTP client
that you can use, that we say,

182
00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:07.825
here are some great ways to do things.

183
00:09:07.825 --> 00:09:11.325
We just give you a ton of stuff, you don't
have to go look for all these libraries.

184
00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:14.807
So as a developer,
you get to jump right in.

185
00:09:14.807 --> 00:09:19.345
And that helps you really quickly to get
up to speed at your new organization.

186
00:09:19.345 --> 00:09:21.660
And then scalability in terms
of scaling your projects,

187
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:25.148
what we have tooling that helps you scale,
we have scaffolding that helps you scale.

188
00:09:25.148 --> 00:09:28.065
And then we also have some things like
some of the optimizations that I'll show

189
00:09:28.065 --> 00:09:30.153
you today,
that also help you scale your application.
