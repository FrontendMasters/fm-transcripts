WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.653
Friends, we're doing great, but
we still have some great stuff to go over.

2
00:00:02.653 --> 00:00:03.910
Let's do this routing thing.

3
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.022
Angular has a built-in, complete router.

4
00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:10.490
So built in a complete that we're even
adding view transitions to the router.

5
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.340
And you could try this out
right now with lays Angular.

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.744
So if you transition to this idea that you
can do like CSS fancy animations between

7
00:00:17.744 --> 00:00:20.030
pages, yeah, do the angular right now.

8
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.460
We just added it, I mean, are we cool?

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.060
Well, right, we're doing all right,
but the package for

10
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.520
the router is angular/router.

11
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.459
So let's look at this example.

12
00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:34.281
So this will be in our app
routes.ts file in our code, okay?

13
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:39.071
So first, I'm exporting this
route's property from this file.

14
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:41.880
And this is all about
separation of concerns, right?

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.883
You could have put this all in one file,

16
00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:48.163
you know what the route
in the router boat.

17
00:00:48.163 --> 00:00:49.917
But you don't want to do that,
you can kinda keep things separate.

18
00:00:49.917 --> 00:00:54.272
All right, so we got our routes,
we got a path and the component.

19
00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.188
Okay, the path and the component.

20
00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.757
The path, what is our path here?

21
00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:01.498
&gt;&gt; Details.

22
00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:02.995
&gt;&gt; Details, exactly right.

23
00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:03.977
It's details.

24
00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:11.197
So if you go to localhost:4200/details,
which component will you be directed to?

25
00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:12.873
&gt;&gt; Details component.

26
00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:17.094
&gt;&gt; Details component, and
this key value pair, these two pairs,

27
00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.685
this is the base for all of your routes.

28
00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:20.663
This is the base.

29
00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:24.016
You can add more routes,
you can add more information.

30
00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:27.116
Actually, you can go really far, right?

31
00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:28.992
We won't go into depth here, but

32
00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:32.213
you can do things like your
authorization at this level.

33
00:01:32.213 --> 00:01:34.878
Okay, so can you visit this route?

34
00:01:34.878 --> 00:01:36.670
Is your user account authorized for it?

35
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.256
You could define it at the route level,
okay?

36
00:01:39.256 --> 00:01:41.016
It's called a route's guard.

37
00:01:41.016 --> 00:01:43.681
It's more advanced than
we can cover today, but

38
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.093
we have a bunch of stuff
that you can do here.

39
00:01:46.093 --> 00:01:50.145
You can set up data that's available
whenever somebody gets to this route,

40
00:01:50.145 --> 00:01:52.056
you can have data that we resolved.

41
00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:58.553
The router is a whole thing,
it's very complete, very robust.

42
00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:02.486
Okay, how do you use the router?

43
00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:03.461
Well, good question.

44
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:07.556
First, wherever you want the router to be,

45
00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:12.325
because if you noticed,
did I say I route to a page?

46
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.475
To a component.

47
00:02:18.475 --> 00:02:20.772
Nice, [SOUND] that's for you.

48
00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:23.535
All right, that's very good,
a route to a component.

49
00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:27.774
So what that means is component
can be a one-liner, which we saw,

50
00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:29.448
it could be 150 lines.

51
00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:32.155
You don't know, so guess what we have.

52
00:02:32.155 --> 00:02:34.723
We say here we got the router-outlet.

53
00:02:34.723 --> 00:02:39.835
Okay, the router-outlet, so wherever we
want the thing you routed to display.

54
00:02:39.835 --> 00:02:44.466
So what this means is you can build
out maybe your header, your footer.

55
00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:47.335
And then in the middle,
put the router outlet so

56
00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:51.304
all the content just shows there
because it's just a component.

57
00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.466
It can have its own unique URL,
but it can share resource, I mean,

58
00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.082
share structure from other
parts of the application.

59
00:02:57.082 --> 00:02:58.332
You can do all of that.

60
00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:02.440
You can have other components on
the same page as your router-outlet,

61
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.223
you do whatever you want to do.

62
00:03:04.223 --> 00:03:07.847
This one gets a little bit of trouble
because there's sometimes people really do

63
00:03:07.847 --> 00:03:08.817
what they want to do.

64
00:03:08.817 --> 00:03:12.862
Don't do what you wanna do,
that was me being free.

65
00:03:12.862 --> 00:03:15.454
What I'm saying is you
have a lot of flexibility.

66
00:03:15.454 --> 00:03:17.529
Don't do what you wanna do,
do the right thing.

67
00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.113
Do good practices, friends at home.

68
00:03:19.113 --> 00:03:24.238
Okay, if I wanna be able to use
router-specific programming

69
00:03:24.238 --> 00:03:28.682
in our template,
I have to import the RouterModule.

70
00:03:28.682 --> 00:03:31.279
Okay, the RouterModule
contains a bunch of stuff.

71
00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.396
Remember I said earlier in the class,
what did modules do for us?

72
00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:38.219
They manage dependencies and
things that will be available to you.

73
00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.886
So this is a part of that,
the RouterModule.

74
00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:44.765
So all the stuff for routers,
you get out the RouterModule.

75
00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:49.405
Okay, now, let's look at how we do it.

76
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:54.312
First, I import my, so
this is an app.config.ts,

77
00:03:54.312 --> 00:03:58.465
okay, app.config.ts, we saw this file.

78
00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:00.963
Okay, so now we say, no,
we did not see it earlier.

79
00:04:00.963 --> 00:04:03.055
I said we would see it later,
and this is what's in here.

80
00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:06.576
So first, we have our routes,
and then we have our providers.

81
00:04:06.576 --> 00:04:10.670
And so we're saying for our application,
this is for the application level,

82
00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.668
provide routing.

83
00:04:11.668 --> 00:04:14.797
And use these routes with your router.

84
00:04:14.797 --> 00:04:17.877
Enable routing and
use these routes with your router.

85
00:04:17.877 --> 00:04:23.963
The term provide can be a little kind
of confusing there for us maybe.

86
00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:25.611
And here's what that comes from.

87
00:04:25.611 --> 00:04:28.436
Angular had this idea,
remember it's about dependency injection.

88
00:04:28.436 --> 00:04:32.668
And we're gonna get to that, but
we have to provide something, right,

89
00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:34.688
provide it, make it available.

90
00:04:34.688 --> 00:04:36.469
That's where that language come from.

91
00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:42.400
So this could easily have been
enable routing and use these routes.

92
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.404
But because of dependency injection,
we call it to provide, right?

93
00:04:45.404 --> 00:04:50.537
So we're saying provide routing,
provide these features to the app, right?

94
00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.759
And so we provide a router, okay?

95
00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.796
But that routes that's being passed in,
guess what that's from.

96
00:04:55.796 --> 00:05:00.636
App.routes, which we just saw,
which is that key value pair,

97
00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:05.183
right, of the path and
the component you're gonna go to.

98
00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:07.052
Yeah, not a lot of talking for that one.

99
00:05:07.052 --> 00:05:12.501
We're gonna get right into the code,
let's go to 07, single 07.

100
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:17.236
All right, let me just save and
get up out of here.

101
00:05:17.236 --> 00:05:21.300
All right, we're gonna 07, routing-basics.

102
00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.586
Oops, I keep gonna go there, README.

103
00:05:26.204 --> 00:05:29.900
Okay, so let's continue our path.

104
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.781
Let's clean up behind us and
start up our new server.

105
00:05:32.781 --> 00:05:35.741
So I'm gonna copy that,
I'm gonna go to the command line.

106
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:41.059
I'm gonna stop the old one,
run our new app.

107
00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.678
Hey, here we go.

108
00:05:43.678 --> 00:05:48.113
I go to this other page and
it tells you what you need to do.

109
00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:51.458
So to make this work,
we gotta enable routing.

110
00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:54.180
So let's do that, let's enable routing.

111
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.448
And I wanna do this one with you again so
we can keep our pace up just a little bit

112
00:05:58.448 --> 00:06:01.539
cuz we still have some more
things I wanna get through.

113
00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.801
I wanna make sure that we
don't have to skip stuff.

114
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:07.868
Okay, I know this might be a little
tricky cuz you just learned it.

115
00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:09.629
Where do we start with the routes?

116
00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:10.790
Anybody remember?

117
00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:14.475
&gt;&gt; In the app.routes.

118
00:06:14.475 --> 00:06:16.685
&gt;&gt; Let's try there,
that sounds good to me.

119
00:06:16.685 --> 00:06:18.947
Aha, look at you.

120
00:06:18.947 --> 00:06:21.236
What is you in here doing
with all these good answers?

121
00:06:21.236 --> 00:06:22.175
Let's start there.

122
00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:25.810
Let's add a route.

123
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.301
It says, add the default path.

124
00:06:27.301 --> 00:06:31.160
What do you think the default path is?

125
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.189
You could just guess.

126
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:35.202
I don't know, I didn't tell you,
so you can just guess if you like.

127
00:06:35.202 --> 00:06:38.148
&gt;&gt; Empty string.

128
00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.454
&gt;&gt; Empty string, good guess.

129
00:06:39.454 --> 00:06:41.627
Yeah, empty string.

130
00:06:41.627 --> 00:06:44.007
So we say path empty string.

131
00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.408
Now, where do I wanna go?

132
00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:55.060
Greetings.

133
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:55.807
&gt;&gt; I sure do.

134
00:06:55.807 --> 00:06:59.099
GreetingsComponent, nailed it.

135
00:06:59.099 --> 00:07:01.842
Okay, path, then go to our component.

136
00:07:01.842 --> 00:07:08.174
Just to kinda show you what some of
the other things you can do to routing.

137
00:07:08.174 --> 00:07:11.272
I'll tell you about how
you get that out of there.

138
00:07:11.272 --> 00:07:12.439
Let's see.

139
00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:15.545
I mean, you got so
many things you can do with your routes.

140
00:07:15.545 --> 00:07:19.669
Yeah, route guard, you can set the title,
something that's really interesting.

141
00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:23.561
It's like loadComponent and loadChildren
is how you can do lazy loading of routes.

142
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:26.939
Lazy loading is where you
don't ship all of the code for

143
00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:31.357
a route unless it's needed, and so
your bundles are smaller, right?

144
00:07:31.357 --> 00:07:34.777
So you can even do stuff like that at
the router level, very nice APIs for

145
00:07:34.777 --> 00:07:35.411
that stuff.

146
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:37.568
Okay, let's keep going.

147
00:07:37.568 --> 00:07:40.312
All right, so the next step, so
we already enabled it in app.routes.

148
00:07:40.312 --> 00:07:44.098
We go to app.config and
let's provide our router.

149
00:07:44.098 --> 00:07:45.309
So let's make that happen.

150
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.122
So this is a two-parter.

151
00:07:52.122 --> 00:07:55.712
So first thing is,
in this providers array,

152
00:07:55.712 --> 00:07:59.784
the first thing I wanna
provide is provideRouter.

153
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:07.779
Okay, I got a function,
but it's complaining.

154
00:08:07.779 --> 00:08:11.288
Anybody know how I can
figure out what it wants?

155
00:08:11.288 --> 00:08:12.583
How can I figure it out?

156
00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:21.662
If I highlight it,
it'll tell me what it's looking for,

157
00:08:21.662 --> 00:08:24.121
An argument for routes was not provided.

158
00:08:24.121 --> 00:08:26.037
So I gotta give an argument for routes.

159
00:08:26.037 --> 00:08:27.578
What's even more argument for routes?

160
00:08:32.505 --> 00:08:33.437
&gt;&gt; Routes?

161
00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:35.504
&gt;&gt; Yeah, routes, good,
good, good, good, good.

162
00:08:35.504 --> 00:08:37.410
Well, we're all one, look at that.

163
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.189
Bam, let's see if it's working.

164
00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:41.639
Still not working.

165
00:08:41.639 --> 00:08:43.268
Unbelievable, he skipped step.

166
00:08:43.268 --> 00:08:47.059
Got one more, or three or two more steps.

167
00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:50.732
Okay, now in app.component,
we gotta get our RouterModule and

168
00:08:50.732 --> 00:08:52.416
we gotta do router-outlet.

169
00:08:52.416 --> 00:08:54.515
We gotta do both of those things.

170
00:08:54.515 --> 00:08:57.045
Import that and then use it.

171
00:08:57.045 --> 00:08:59.875
So let's get this party
all the way started.

172
00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:02.629
So let's go back to our 07 src app.

173
00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:05.896
I'm switching over to app.component.

174
00:09:08.989 --> 00:09:12.259
Okay, first thing, imports.

175
00:09:12.259 --> 00:09:16.729
Let's do route, come on, IntelliSense,
stop helping me for a second.

176
00:09:16.729 --> 00:09:19.271
RouterModule, RouterModule.

177
00:09:19.271 --> 00:09:22.837
Okay, we got that part.

178
00:09:22.837 --> 00:09:25.467
So I imported it by just typing it,
I let it help me.

179
00:09:25.467 --> 00:09:28.857
So on line 3, it helped me,
RouterModule there.

180
00:09:28.857 --> 00:09:29.804
Feels good.

181
00:09:29.804 --> 00:09:32.658
And then I had to import it so
my component could use it.

182
00:09:32.658 --> 00:09:35.527
My component, not opponent,
so my opponent could use it.

183
00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:39.247
No, so my component can use it.

184
00:09:39.247 --> 00:09:41.319
And then I do router-outlet.

185
00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:42.810
Could you self-closing.

186
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.922
Now, I wanna save this, and

187
00:09:45.922 --> 00:09:51.121
then I'm going to,
look at that nice message.

188
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:53.430
I can tell it's from me.

189
00:09:54.869 --> 00:09:55.797
All right, [LAUGH]
