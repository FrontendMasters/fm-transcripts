1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.130
All right,
let's go to 09-tmplate-driven-forms.

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.830
Template-driven-forms 09.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.680
Let's rock this thing.

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.790
Y'all are doing so good, I'm telling you,
y'all are doing so well.

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.270
I'm so impressed.

6
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.288
I'm gonna go back to Google and
be like, yo, look, I don't know, man,

7
00:00:15.288 --> 00:00:18.740
we got this new group of angular
developers about to change the world.

8
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.578
Y'all gotta get up there [LAUGH].

9
00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:25.322
We almost have friends, almost their
friends who are hanging in there.

10
00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:28.421
That's gonna read me up, and
let's get through these instructions.

11
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:32.347
All right, here's what we're gonna do,

12
00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:34.446
I'll let you catch up
with this real quick.

13
00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:36.566
Let's run this activity.

14
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:41.363
So let's make these inputs, and
then let's make this our text area.

15
00:00:42.923 --> 00:00:44.933
Okay, let's see what we got on the screen,
though.

16
00:00:44.933 --> 00:00:47.623
Yes, this is gonna be really fun.

17
00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:49.512
I like this one, this is a good one.

18
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.927
Okay, I wanna start
walking us through that.

19
00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:01.873
I'm gonna go into my app.component file.

20
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:09.561
Okay, we're gonna add our input.

21
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:15.059
So I can do input, and
this type equals text,

22
00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:21.439
equals type, equals text,
and then we also had Id.

23
00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:25.537
Was it my thing?

24
00:01:25.537 --> 00:01:27.821
One second, and Id was title.

25
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.091
Let's see if that'll let me do it.

26
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:31.162
Is that how you do that?

27
00:01:31.162 --> 00:01:33.654
No, no, no, no,
that's how you do this, okay.

28
00:01:36.792 --> 00:01:37.701
Okay, there you go.

29
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:40.480
It's close, but not exactly what I wanted.

30
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.133
Trying to use Emmet, but
don't use Emmet right now.

31
00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:48.688
Because I'm trying to be fair so
you're gonna do it wrong and

32
00:01:48.688 --> 00:01:51.350
then you spent too much
time trying to fix it.

33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.134
All right and then we're gonna have
our text area where id equals body.

34
00:01:59.099 --> 00:02:01.319
Okay, so we got a text area.

35
00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:05.019
We'll take all the extra properties out.

36
00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:09.515
And ID equals body,
do I got my ID equals title?

37
00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:14.070
And so here's something I learned about
labels that you can do if you want

38
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.915
to skip the for and the ID part,
you just wrap your element in the label.

39
00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:19.891
But if you don't wanna wrap it.

40
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:22.981
It then you got to do it this way, yeah?

41
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:26.021
So what I mean is this.

42
00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:30.655
If you do this, right?

43
00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:32.787
If you do that then you don't need the for

44
00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:36.198
because it's automatically
associated if you make it a child.

45
00:02:38.031 --> 00:02:42.740
Okay, so let's save that get
this nice looking blog post.

46
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.060
Look at that, that looks nice.

47
00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.170
Man, I wonder who designed that?

48
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.470
He did a good job, man.

49
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.840
Website looking like a blog.

50
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.120
All right, very fun, and
then we just got to add two properties.

51
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.609
So then, we got to add two properties.

52
00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.169
Two string properties, title and body.

53
00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.168
Okay, sounds good.

54
00:03:02.168 --> 00:03:09.407
So we do title and this is a string so
we can just do equals empty string and

55
00:03:09.407 --> 00:03:13.405
then we have body equals empty string.

56
00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:15.713
We got that done, it's too tight.

57
00:03:15.713 --> 00:03:16.592
Let's get rid of that one.

58
00:03:16.592 --> 00:03:23.136
Okay, cool, and then next after that,
we saw we made our model data.

59
00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:26.202
Okay, last part is just
to add the NG model and

60
00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:30.096
the title to the form, NG model and
the title of the form.

61
00:03:30.096 --> 00:03:32.046
So let's do that.

62
00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.935
So if we go up here.

63
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.779
All right, so that title,
why don't you like me?

64
00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.349
I know why we'll fix them second.

65
00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.929
We got a title here.

66
00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:56.635
And then we'll do body down here,
both use NG model.

67
00:03:56.635 --> 00:04:02.205
But remember these properties are actually
coming from our component class, okay?

68
00:04:02.205 --> 00:04:03.844
And the final step.

69
00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:08.394
To make sure everything works,
we've got to do our imports.

70
00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:21.220
FormsModule, okay, so you've got to
have the import into formsModule.

71
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.400
All right, her Oscar Oscar.

72
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.420
Liberty, I can see what I got there.

73
00:04:31.733 --> 00:04:35.790
All right friends we're cooking
are as good as last part as string

74
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.657
interpolations for both to confirm that
the values are bad bow, so what I meant

75
00:04:40.657 --> 00:04:45.111
by that is I left that in there for
you to to handle, but we'll do it too.

76
00:04:45.111 --> 00:04:47.148
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

77
00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:48.168
Let me just do this with you.

78
00:04:49.808 --> 00:04:50.771
I do this with you.

79
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:55.456
All right, so we'll do the title and
this is really just going to be title.

80
00:04:55.456 --> 00:05:01.000
Bam and
then we'll do this last one here right?

81
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.201
Okay, okay, okay, but
it's not value is buddy, okay.

82
00:05:08.931 --> 00:05:13.051
Now let's go to our screen
where our beautiful blog post.

83
00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:19.065
Okay,

84
00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:31.116
Wow on screen is true
autobiographical story.

85
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:41.171
Then a Hollywood agent saw the stream and

86
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:47.172
said, boy, Let's see,
he, that's what he said.

87
00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:54.072
He's like, boy, come host a game show.

88
00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:56.402
Boy, come host a game show.

89
00:05:56.402 --> 00:06:03.130
And I said, well,
Steve Harvey is my uncle.

90
00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:12.746
And he said, Okay,

91
00:06:12.746 --> 00:06:16.857
this is an autobiographical story, I don't
know if y'all knew this is what happened.

92
00:06:16.857 --> 00:06:23.387
[LAUGH] All right, so I became famous, but
if you notice as I was typing everything,

93
00:06:23.387 --> 00:06:29.674
it was changing in real time because
the form was keeping the data in tune.

94
00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:30.494
You see what I'm saying?

95
00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:35.504
It was like keeping it together,
but that goes both ways.

96
00:06:35.504 --> 00:06:39.131
If we were to update these properties
a different way, like from the code.

97
00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:42.212
It would also update the model.

98
00:06:42.212 --> 00:06:46.892
So that's what the square parentheses at
two way binding, square parentheses, okay?

99
00:06:46.892 --> 00:06:49.252
Yeah, this is nice, right?

100
00:06:49.252 --> 00:06:53.589
And again, when you have a smaller form,
friends, you have a smaller form,

101
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:55.202
this is perfect.

102
00:06:55.202 --> 00:06:56.541
Not too much headache.

103
00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:59.831
I wanna access the properties,
I got them right there.

104
00:06:59.831 --> 00:07:04.280
Do you know what else is really nice form
validation is also whatever the HTML

105
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.082
validators are.

106
00:07:06.082 --> 00:07:10.852
So you know how you can type required into
a form field and it will make it required.

107
00:07:10.852 --> 00:07:12.812
That works with temperature forms.

108
00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:15.772
Stuff like that.

109
00:07:15.772 --> 00:07:16.972
So you get a lot of value.

110
00:07:16.972 --> 00:07:17.608
All right,

111
00:07:17.608 --> 00:07:21.751
what questions can I answer before we go
on about my story about being famous.

112
00:07:23.873 --> 00:07:27.704
&gt;&gt; Can you go back to your-
&gt;&gt; To my roots as an actor?

113
00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:29.144
I can go back to my roots.

114
00:07:29.144 --> 00:07:31.621
&gt;&gt; Okay, and then do that [CROSSTALK].

115
00:07:31.621 --> 00:07:33.811
&gt;&gt; Okay, the app components.

116
00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:34.446
&gt;&gt; Sure thing.

117
00:07:34.446 --> 00:07:42.696
&gt;&gt; So okay.

118
00:07:42.696 --> 00:07:46.002
Yeah, and make sure that you've
got forms module imported.

119
00:07:46.002 --> 00:07:47.533
That'll make it not work.

120
00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:48.053
&gt;&gt; Yep.

121
00:07:48.053 --> 00:07:50.062
&gt;&gt; Okay, great, great,
great, great, great.

122
00:07:50.062 --> 00:07:52.144
Yeah, so remember,
you've got to have, sorry?

123
00:07:52.144 --> 00:07:53.499
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; I was going to say,

124
00:07:53.499 --> 00:07:58.255
you've got forms module to enable the form
behavior for a template different forms.

125
00:07:58.255 --> 00:07:59.795
We do a lot of NG model.

126
00:07:59.795 --> 00:08:02.685
And then remember, these properties have
to be properties that are defined in

127
00:08:02.685 --> 00:08:05.525
your application class if you're
gonna actually reference them.

128
00:08:05.525 --> 00:08:08.535
Okay, now let's talk about reactive forms.

129
00:08:08.535 --> 00:08:10.265
Here's the next part of the story.

130
00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:14.965
So, first, before we do anything with a
reactive form, we define our model, right?

131
00:08:14.965 --> 00:08:17.035
And this is actually programmatic now.

132
00:08:17.035 --> 00:08:20.651
So, now we're at the programmatically,
we'll get the login form.

133
00:08:21.664 --> 00:08:23.515
Just name for a model.

134
00:08:23.515 --> 00:08:26.075
And then we have a form group.

135
00:08:26.075 --> 00:08:30.525
A FormGroup represents a group
of FormControls, okay?

136
00:08:30.525 --> 00:08:35.524
So let's say that you could have a page on
your application that has multiple forms

137
00:08:35.524 --> 00:08:37.435
like types of forms on it.

138
00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:38.563
People have to stuff like that, right.

139
00:08:38.563 --> 00:08:41.563
And you don't want them all to
be a part of the same form made.

140
00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:44.647
So think about a multi step,
like sign up, let's say in healthcare,

141
00:08:44.647 --> 00:08:45.813
you see this a lot.

142
00:08:45.813 --> 00:08:49.376
Well, you have to check in and each form
is different part of the page, right.

143
00:08:49.376 --> 00:08:52.988
So form group allows you to like group
them together programmatically for

144
00:08:52.988 --> 00:08:56.251
yourself, and that you can validate
against that one form instead

145
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.653
of validating all of your
forms at the same time.

146
00:08:58.653 --> 00:09:00.484
This is where you get a lot of value.

147
00:09:00.484 --> 00:09:04.214
Okay so you got your name, property, that
will be the name, that name is important.

148
00:09:04.214 --> 00:09:08.174
So you definitely wanna keep like
an idea of what's on the left hand side.

149
00:09:08.174 --> 00:09:09.344
That's the form control.

150
00:09:09.344 --> 00:09:11.072
Wait what type is that form control?

151
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.514
What type of value does it accept?

152
00:09:15.514 --> 00:09:18.054
A string, remember I said they were typed?

153
00:09:18.054 --> 00:09:20.924
This is where reactive forms really shine.

154
00:09:20.924 --> 00:09:25.614
So I can tell you if you put anything in
this form that doesn't match the type,

155
00:09:25.614 --> 00:09:28.414
we can give you some errors early on.

156
00:09:28.414 --> 00:09:29.624
Okay, so we got the form control.

157
00:09:29.624 --> 00:09:30.655
Now check this out.

158
00:09:30.655 --> 00:09:33.601
Here's our form now, here's our form.

159
00:09:35.611 --> 00:09:38.902
First I combined the form
to a form group and

160
00:09:38.902 --> 00:09:43.744
tell it what is the data model
that represents this form.

161
00:09:43.744 --> 00:09:45.314
It's login form.

162
00:09:45.314 --> 00:09:48.214
That's my data model, very nice.

163
00:09:48.214 --> 00:09:49.844
Then I got this form control name.

164
00:09:49.844 --> 00:09:52.904
Here's a big, big, big gotcha, okay?

165
00:09:53.944 --> 00:09:55.724
What does it look like it's missing?

166
00:09:55.724 --> 00:09:58.102
Can anybody guess what it
looks like it's missing?

167
00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:04.335
&gt;&gt; The brackets only,
&gt;&gt; No brackets can be pumped up that there

168
00:10:04.335 --> 00:10:09.174
are no brackets there it looks
like the brackets are missing.

169
00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:16.068
But in this case we're actually not
trying to bind to a property directly.

170
00:10:16.068 --> 00:10:20.387
That this is the name of the property so
we don't have to bind to the value.

171
00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:25.887
The only time you would do the brackets is
if you want to dynamically set that name.

172
00:10:25.887 --> 00:10:31.647
You see if it was dynamic, but because
we know the name from our list, right?

173
00:10:31.647 --> 00:10:34.027
So that's why I said look at
the left hand side, right?

174
00:10:34.027 --> 00:10:35.237
So you got your name.

175
00:10:35.237 --> 00:10:39.118
So in our case, so
this is like username, okay, right.

176
00:10:39.118 --> 00:10:41.818
And same thing with password, right?

177
00:10:41.818 --> 00:10:42.678
The form control name.

178
00:10:42.678 --> 00:10:43.788
So it's going to link those back.

179
00:10:43.788 --> 00:10:45.708
Let's say we have that model, okay.

180
00:10:45.708 --> 00:10:46.738
Then you get one more you do.

181
00:10:48.678 --> 00:10:52.630
So we, so then when a form is submitted,
because here's what happens when you make

182
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:56.508
a button that says submit on a form,
what do you think happens?

183
00:10:56.508 --> 00:11:00.861
It submits, what does the normal submit
action is to refresh the page, right?

184
00:11:00.861 --> 00:11:02.681
So go through and refresh the page.

185
00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:03.464
In angular land,

186
00:11:03.464 --> 00:11:07.211
you probably don't want to do that
because it's a single page application.

187
00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:12.192
What you're probably hoping to do is to
gather the information from the form,

188
00:11:12.192 --> 00:11:15.820
process that information,
then make maybe an API call.

189
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:18.075
This gives you the ability to do that.

190
00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:20.406
So instead of having
to do prevent default,

191
00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:23.143
try to catch it before
it you know that stuff.

192
00:11:23.143 --> 00:11:26.693
So as you submit when you're going
to submit, do this thing, okay?

193
00:11:26.693 --> 00:11:29.903
So nice little thanks and event,
and you're gonna handle that event.

194
00:11:29.903 --> 00:11:33.663
All right, here's an example
of what that could look like.

195
00:11:33.663 --> 00:11:37.643
If we go to like in our component class
at some point, we get our login form.

196
00:11:37.643 --> 00:11:38.735
You gotta like handle submit.

197
00:11:40.336 --> 00:11:42.899
And I can do something else,
but how do I get the values?

198
00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:48.396
Well, I do this.loginForm.value, and
then that value is available to me.
