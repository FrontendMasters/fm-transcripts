1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.574
I got this nice,
beautiful code on the screen.

2
00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:05.960
I'm a junior developer.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.620
I just started, don't roast me.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.400
I'm a junior.

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.712
What feedback would you give me
as a junior if you saw this code?

6
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.810
&gt;&gt; Use a loop.

7
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.913
&gt;&gt; Use a loop That's a loop.

8
00:00:21.913 --> 00:00:23.763
That's what I was doing in the air, yeah.

9
00:00:23.763 --> 00:00:25.503
Gotta use a loop, right?

10
00:00:25.503 --> 00:00:26.813
So how can I do this?

11
00:00:26.813 --> 00:00:28.473
How can I make this with a loop?

12
00:00:28.473 --> 00:00:32.753
And you'll have some really
cool stuff with the for syntax.

13
00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:33.484
I'm tell you what,

14
00:00:33.484 --> 00:00:36.493
this is special after I show it to
you cuz you will not believe me.

15
00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:40.132
You'll not believe me, but it's okay.

16
00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:41.118
I'm just gonna tell you.

17
00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:43.398
All right, so here's a for syntax.

18
00:00:43.398 --> 00:00:48.355
Looks very similar to a traditional for
loop in our template.

19
00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:55.558
First, you got the @for,
then you have item of cart, right?

20
00:00:55.558 --> 00:01:01.716
So it's individual elements of collection,
individual element of collection, right?

21
00:01:01.716 --> 00:01:03.646
So this is our local variable item.

22
00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:07.886
The cart must exist in our
component class, right?

23
00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:10.450
But the item could be
whatever we want it to be.

24
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.018
I just called it an item cuz
maybe you got a shopping cart,

25
00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:19.096
then track item by item id.

26
00:01:19.096 --> 00:01:21.434
Now why is that track important?

27
00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:24.294
Okay, without getting
too deep into the weeds,

28
00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:28.354
this mechanic allows us to be
hyper-efficient with the rendering.

29
00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:33.336
When I say hyper-efficient we, okay,
this is a true story about Angular,

30
00:01:33.336 --> 00:01:35.494
true story friends, you can check it out.

31
00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:36.594
We got a blog post about this.

32
00:01:37.614 --> 00:01:40.464
Angular wasn't really known for
like rendering speed before, right?

33
00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:41.656
Nobody was talking about that.

34
00:01:41.656 --> 00:01:43.096
Let's be honest.

35
00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:45.006
We were pretty low in the ranking.

36
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:49.992
When we changed this, we went all
the way to the front of the rankings

37
00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:55.636
faster than everything but
SOLID with template rendering with lists.

38
00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:58.026
Specifically in this case, right?

39
00:01:58.026 --> 00:01:59.226
Faster than everything but SOLID.

40
00:01:59.226 --> 00:02:03.045
SOLID is the only thing that's faster than
Angular with rendering now because of

41
00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:05.246
this syntax to track
helps us to achieve that.

42
00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:10.282
Okay, now not every part of Angular
is fast and everything, I'm saying,

43
00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:14.463
rendering templates, working with lists
and swapping rows, fast and everything,

44
00:02:14.463 --> 00:02:16.286
how do we come up with that data?

45
00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:23.324
An independent engineer maintains this
list of speeds in this massive table.

46
00:02:23.324 --> 00:02:24.684
And he was like, this changed it.

47
00:02:24.684 --> 00:02:25.954
And we saw the new list.

48
00:02:25.954 --> 00:02:27.814
We're like, is that us?

49
00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:29.224
We're looking good on there.

50
00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:30.144
Yeah, let's go.

51
00:02:30.144 --> 00:02:32.124
And then so
that's the part of the new story.

52
00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:36.317
So this is a really huge performance
benefit for you to use this syntax.

53
00:02:36.317 --> 00:02:39.370
Okay, and then you can reference
whatever that item was,

54
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.121
whatever you call that local variable.

55
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:43.351
You can reference it in your template.

56
00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:48.795
One of the cool thing about this you also
can get access to the ID because you might

57
00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:51.565
want the ID like the iterator count,
sorry, sometimes,

58
00:02:51.565 --> 00:02:54.901
like the index, that's what I
meant not ID you want the index.

59
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.091
You also get access to that if you want.

60
00:02:57.091 --> 00:03:00.241
Okay, what dollar sign index
which is special syntax.

61
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:02.364
Okay, here's something
else that's interesting.

62
00:03:02.364 --> 00:03:06.340
Anybody ever wrote a template and
then you have your list of things, but

63
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.664
you gotta have your conditional to
display what if nothing showed up?

64
00:03:10.664 --> 00:03:14.424
So either show the list or
show an empty message, okay.

65
00:03:14.424 --> 00:03:16.514
Well here's what we offer you.

66
00:03:16.514 --> 00:03:21.644
You just tag on an empty at the end
of this for, just tag it on there.

67
00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:22.753
So if it's empty, we show this.

68
00:03:24.124 --> 00:03:28.374
That's super clear, super readable
from a person reading your code.

69
00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:29.874
They know exactly what's happening here.

70
00:03:29.874 --> 00:03:33.474
They don't have to kinda guess
about your conditions and stuff.

71
00:03:33.474 --> 00:03:35.257
So I'm gonna close up these files.

72
00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:40.074
Okay, gonna stop my server.

73
00:03:41.074 --> 00:03:42.255
Let me clean that right up.

74
00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:48.072
[SOUND] And then I'm gonna go into 05.

75
00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:49.602
Yeah, okay, we're doing good.

76
00:03:49.602 --> 00:03:52.153
We're getting there.

77
00:03:52.153 --> 00:03:55.487
I'll go to the README so
we can be ready to rock

78
00:04:00.601 --> 00:04:03.846
All right,
I'm gonna take my run this example so

79
00:04:03.846 --> 00:04:08.448
I can make sure I can run it and
have it displayed on the screen, okay?

80
00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:13.478
Okay, great, I can go and
see what this is.

81
00:04:13.478 --> 00:04:15.078
This is huge.

82
00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:17.018
Let me zoom out a little bit.

83
00:04:17.018 --> 00:04:24.055
It's probably like a product listing for
a vehicle, okay?

84
00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.385
So we're actually gonna solve this and
make it work, make it look nice.

85
00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:29.815
It looks nice, but
we're gonna actually fill in some data.

86
00:04:29.815 --> 00:04:31.085
All right, so here's what's happening.

87
00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:36.443
So in app.component.ts,
we got to update the component template

88
00:04:36.443 --> 00:04:41.707
to repeat the article listing,
right, this article element with

89
00:04:41.707 --> 00:04:46.694
class equals listing for
each of the elements in the carsList.

90
00:04:48.744 --> 00:04:52.790
Then we're gonna update the template to
use the properties of the carsList and

91
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.839
then save our code.

92
00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:04.101
&gt;&gt; Can you explain the track item.id part?

93
00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:07.021
&gt;&gt; Sure, let me just go back to that
while people are working on that part.

94
00:05:07.021 --> 00:05:09.218
Let's go back to the track item by id.

95
00:05:09.218 --> 00:05:11.621
Okay, let me go back, cool.

96
00:05:11.621 --> 00:05:16.175
So track item by id, so this track thing
here is just our way of being to have some

97
00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:21.075
optimizations when we're rendering your
components, sorry, rendering the list

98
00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:25.501
in the templates, is for
giving some optimization that we can have.

99
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:27.511
Right now we're saying track item by id.

100
00:05:27.511 --> 00:05:30.881
Ids work really great, right?

101
00:05:30.881 --> 00:05:36.031
But if you can't get an id,
then you can also track by the item.

102
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:38.161
React has a feature just
like this when you do maps.

103
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:40.771
I think you have a key or
something like that.

104
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:45.017
So it's very similar to that key idea that
you can keep track of the dom elements as

105
00:05:45.017 --> 00:05:48.702
they're created by some unique value
that can help you to be faster and

106
00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:52.898
smarter about when you have to re-render
or swap rows and do all kinds of stuff.

107
00:05:52.898 --> 00:05:54.279
That gives us that ability.

108
00:05:57.519 --> 00:06:01.306
So similar to the key in React similar but
not the same.

109
00:06:01.306 --> 00:06:04.268
But you don't have to use id
you can use the object itself.

110
00:06:04.268 --> 00:06:07.089
So if you only have the item,
let's say, you can do item or

111
00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:09.908
you can do the indices in
the array if you want to.

112
00:06:09.908 --> 00:06:11.178
You can do lots of stuff.

113
00:06:11.178 --> 00:06:12.818
Good question, I like that question.

114
00:06:13.938 --> 00:06:14.848
I like all y'all questions.

115
00:06:14.848 --> 00:06:15.688
Keep ' coming.

116
00:06:15.688 --> 00:06:17.158
Let's keep cooking together.

117
00:06:17.158 --> 00:06:17.848
We're doing great.

118
00:06:17.848 --> 00:06:19.088
Y'all are doing so great.

119
00:06:19.088 --> 00:06:23.228
If you're not proud of yourself right now,
you should be 'cause I'm proud of you.

120
00:06:23.228 --> 00:06:26.973
Here's an example where I
decided that the styling for

121
00:06:26.973 --> 00:06:31.942
this was a distraction to teaching and
I put it in a separate, you see?

122
00:06:31.942 --> 00:06:36.039
So it's like 40 lines of styles, I just
put it in a separate file because it was

123
00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:38.622
a distraction, it's too many,
it's too much.

124
00:06:39.642 --> 00:06:41.232
You can't focus on your work, okay?

125
00:06:41.232 --> 00:06:44.394
And so then remember I said you
could separate it if you wanted.

126
00:06:44.394 --> 00:06:49.614
So on line 36 of my editor,
I have app.component.css reference.

127
00:06:49.614 --> 00:06:55.674
But if you notice I went from styles,
property to styleUrl, right?

128
00:06:55.674 --> 00:06:57.558
So I could tell it styleUrl.

129
00:06:57.558 --> 00:06:59.974
Okay, let's go, this is exciting.

130
00:06:59.974 --> 00:07:00.984
What's the first thing you wanna do?

131
00:07:00.984 --> 00:07:03.384
You want to have some fun,
let's have some fun.

132
00:07:03.384 --> 00:07:08.456
All right, so this is the element,
we gotta repeat this article element.

133
00:07:08.456 --> 00:07:11.016
So I'm gonna collapse it just for
a second.

134
00:07:11.016 --> 00:07:13.076
I'm gonna collapse it in my editor.

135
00:07:13.076 --> 00:07:14.046
I did not delete it.

136
00:07:14.046 --> 00:07:17.476
I'm just gonna collapse it so
we can have some focused attention here.

137
00:07:17.476 --> 00:07:25.847
So @for, let's say car of carList.

138
00:07:27.842 --> 00:07:33.047
Then I want to track, and
then I want to track, let's say, car.

139
00:07:33.047 --> 00:07:34.548
Do I have ids on each car, I don't know.

140
00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:36.545
I gotta tick.
I don't recall.

141
00:07:36.545 --> 00:07:42.878
So I don't have an id on
these elements which is okay.

142
00:07:42.878 --> 00:07:46.654
So in that case, we can just
track using the car object, okay?

143
00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:48.526
So that'd be good enough for now.

144
00:07:48.526 --> 00:07:49.616
That'll solve our problem.

145
00:07:50.806 --> 00:07:55.026
Wait, I did not include, so
it's gotta go actually around this thing.

146
00:07:55.026 --> 00:07:55.526
There we go.

147
00:07:56.746 --> 00:07:58.746
So all the code is still there.

148
00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:03.156
You see, I just collapsed it so
that way we can focus on this part.

149
00:08:03.156 --> 00:08:04.979
Okay, this makes it look cleaner for us.

150
00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:08.269
Now if we go back to our screen,
now we got a bunch of them.

151
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:12.109
Now let's make them look
good with some data.

152
00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:16.709
So now we got to be referencing this car,
right?

153
00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:17.409
We got a car.

154
00:08:19.269 --> 00:08:22.851
All right, so let's see what can we put
the car details, car, make and model,

155
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:23.399
all right.

156
00:08:24.519 --> 00:08:29.180
Now, how do you usually reference
a car with their make and model?

157
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.996
How do you say it in just regular
language when you speak it out loud?

158
00:08:32.996 --> 00:08:36.940
If I had a Focus made by Ford,
what would I say?

159
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:37.900
&gt;&gt; Ford Focus.

160
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, so there are a couple
of ways we can do this then.

161
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:46.664
So we could do, we can interpolate two
values or we could do just one expression.

162
00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:47.874
We get to choose, is what I'm saying.

163
00:08:49.474 --> 00:08:50.654
So we could do two values.

164
00:08:50.654 --> 00:08:52.314
But if you wanted to, you could do that.

165
00:08:52.314 --> 00:08:53.244
So it's make and model.

166
00:08:53.244 --> 00:08:58.044
So it will be car.make, I guess, yes.

167
00:08:58.044 --> 00:09:00.368
And then car.model.

168
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.982
All right, so
now if we look at our screen.

169
00:09:09.982 --> 00:09:11.536
[LAUGH] All right,

170
00:09:11.536 --> 00:09:17.347
I'm only laughing at myself because
I think my last one is clever.

171
00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:20.507
Even though I'm kinda being smug,
laughing at myself.

172
00:09:20.507 --> 00:09:24.409
I think it's very clever with the Fjord,
but that's all right.

173
00:09:24.409 --> 00:09:25.464
All right, keep going.

174
00:09:25.464 --> 00:09:26.299
So we got that part.

175
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.371
Let's fill in the rest of the data.

176
00:09:27.371 --> 00:09:28.729
Keep the party going.

177
00:09:28.729 --> 00:09:30.429
Can I tell you something
while we're filling this in?

178
00:09:30.429 --> 00:09:34.539
Can I tell you that my
child can't stand our car?

179
00:09:34.539 --> 00:09:38.749
Six-years-old, he can't stand our
car because he says it's slow.

180
00:09:38.749 --> 00:09:40.649
I drive a family vehicle.

181
00:09:40.649 --> 00:09:43.049
I drive a Kia SUV.

182
00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.694
And he thinks it's the slowest car.

183
00:09:44.694 --> 00:09:46.450
He's like, dad, I hate this car.

184
00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:48.160
It's so slow.

185
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.840
You can't even go 50 miles per hour.

186
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:53.720
He says that and I'm like,
it can bud, the car can go that fast.

187
00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.380
But he wants us to get a Tesla.

188
00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:03.220
And I'm like, no,
I'm not buying $100,000 car, no.

189
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.881
And so, yeah, it's a constant battle.

190
00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.411
Like, it's hard being a parent, man.

191
00:10:07.411 --> 00:10:09.871
You got kids who are just
like roasting your car.

192
00:10:09.871 --> 00:10:13.251
It starts early, I guess,
and it only escalates.

193
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:15.181
All right, so we got the year there.

194
00:10:15.181 --> 00:10:18.981
We got the transmission type,
so automatic or manual.

195
00:10:18.981 --> 00:10:22.468
And let's see,
do I not even have a property for that?

196
00:10:25.257 --> 00:10:26.692
Why didn't you all tell me?

197
00:10:26.692 --> 00:10:30.624
All right [LAUGH] okay, so
here's what we can do to solve for that.

198
00:10:30.624 --> 00:10:32.434
Here's what we can do, we can add it.

199
00:10:34.584 --> 00:10:36.194
All right, so I'm gonna add it quickly.

200
00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:42.108
Okay, so we know that should go here and
we can do transmission and

201
00:10:42.108 --> 00:10:47.005
then we'll just say they're all automatic
for now and then if we have any of

202
00:10:47.005 --> 00:10:51.837
our friends who drive manual,
you can add your own and change it.

203
00:10:51.837 --> 00:10:54.579
It's okay, you don't have to yell at
me and like roast me and say like,

204
00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:56.196
I want to look at
the comments on this one.

205
00:10:56.196 --> 00:10:59.937
People are like, he ain't even put
the right thing driving automatic.

206
00:10:59.937 --> 00:11:02.422
So weak, I know,.

207
00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:04.414
Okay, there we go.

208
00:11:08.093 --> 00:11:09.812
And then we got the miles.

209
00:11:09.812 --> 00:11:12.952
Okay, miles is good.

210
00:11:12.952 --> 00:11:14.562
Okay, and then let's see miles.

211
00:11:14.562 --> 00:11:16.552
And we should be pretty good to cook here,
right?

212
00:11:16.552 --> 00:11:18.112
We're cooking, we're ready to roll.

213
00:11:19.282 --> 00:11:22.785
And then we got this last one, that price.

214
00:11:22.785 --> 00:11:23.687
Okay, great.

215
00:11:26.468 --> 00:11:28.662
We have all of our data, okay, and

216
00:11:28.662 --> 00:11:33.438
everything looked nicer when it
wasn't like zoomed in by 1,000% but

217
00:11:33.438 --> 00:11:38.035
something that happened yeah,
it's not for Specific Motors Spoke.

218
00:11:38.035 --> 00:11:39.015
I just be writing stuff.

219
00:11:39.015 --> 00:11:41.944
Okay, all right, so yeah, so we're good.

220
00:11:41.944 --> 00:11:47.080
So now we have our for
loop around all of these elements, right?

221
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.184
And one thing you could
probably do if you wanted,

222
00:11:49.184 --> 00:11:52.100
what else could we do to just
improve this code if we wanted to?

223
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:53.330
Anything come to mind, friends?

224
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.520
Anybody watching online?

225
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.560
Does anything come to mind what you
could do for this one to improve it?

226
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.820
I'll tell you what I would do.

227
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:05.041
I would probably take our car listing
component and separate it into its own

228
00:12:05.041 --> 00:12:09.198
component because right now,
this template is pretty complex, right?

229
00:12:09.198 --> 00:12:13.958
Because we have quite a bit of markup in
this template and we could separate this.

230
00:12:15.248 --> 00:12:16.298
But we'd have one problem.

231
00:12:16.298 --> 00:12:19.842
How would it know what data to display?

232
00:12:22.993 --> 00:12:25.880
We're gonna answer that question,
don't worry, that wasn't a trick question.

233
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.000
I want you to try to think.

234
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We can answer that, yeah.

235
00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.610
&gt;&gt; You got track car.

236
00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.858
Do you have to put ID, or
does it just assume ID?

237
00:12:34.858 --> 00:12:36.410
&gt;&gt; Since there is no ID, right.

238
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.420
So I have track car right here.

239
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.860
You need to put something here, though.

240
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.628
The track is mandatory.

241
00:12:41.628 --> 00:12:45.888
If you have an ID, IDs work great
because IDs are usually unique, right?

242
00:12:45.888 --> 00:12:48.568
So a unique value works great here.

243
00:12:48.568 --> 00:12:51.788
But because I don't have an ID,
I'm saying, hey, try to track this object.

244
00:12:51.788 --> 00:12:54.058
And I'm hoping that it can
check the object and you-

245
00:12:54.058 --> 00:12:55.480
&gt;&gt; So you don't have to point to

246
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.138
a property.

247
00:12:56.138 --> 00:12:58.710
You can point at an entire object.

248
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

249
00:13:00.448 --> 00:13:03.621
&gt;&gt; That's the handle dynamically
if we added something to the list,

250
00:13:03.621 --> 00:13:06.313
took something out of the list at all.

251
00:13:06.313 --> 00:13:07.843
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Track that and update it.

252
00:13:07.843 --> 00:13:11.503
&gt;&gt; Is it automatically
generate like an iterator.

253
00:13:12.623 --> 00:13:15.554
&gt;&gt; I don't know what it does,
unlike under the hood, but

254
00:13:15.554 --> 00:13:17.283
that's the reason is correct.

255
00:13:17.283 --> 00:13:21.223
What you said is for like row swapping,
switching, deleting, editing.

256
00:13:21.223 --> 00:13:23.658
This makes this really fast and
easy for us, right?

257
00:13:23.658 --> 00:13:27.468
Because you go to like Big O of 1 when
you have an ID for something, right?

258
00:13:27.468 --> 00:13:30.328
But if you don't have anything,
then we got to search for it.

259
00:13:30.328 --> 00:13:31.982
And if you got millions of rows or
whatever, it gives us-

260
00:13:31.982 --> 00:13:33.228
&gt;&gt; It's just gotta be unique.

261
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:36.418
&gt;&gt; So I don't know if it has to be unique.

262
00:13:36.418 --> 00:13:37.948
I think it's supposed to be.

263
00:13:37.948 --> 00:13:39.438
Okay, here's how we can find out.

264
00:13:39.438 --> 00:13:41.982
Okay, let's try something.

265
00:13:41.982 --> 00:13:45.645
Let's just see what happens if we
do something that's not unique or

266
00:13:45.645 --> 00:13:46.632
any of these.

267
00:13:46.632 --> 00:13:49.612
Okay, so year is not unique.

268
00:13:49.612 --> 00:13:53.482
Both of these are 1991, right?

269
00:13:53.482 --> 00:13:58.754
So if I did track by car.year,
let's see if we get any errors or

270
00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:01.353
if anything happens, right?

271
00:14:01.353 --> 00:14:02.401
So it still works.

272
00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:04.301
And if I refresh it, it still works.

273
00:14:04.301 --> 00:14:07.571
But I wonder if we had to do
operations would it be slower now?

274
00:14:07.571 --> 00:14:09.261
Or would there be any
complications later on?

275
00:14:09.261 --> 00:14:10.091
I don't know.

276
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:15.311
But I wonder what would happen now that we
have a non unique identifier to track by.

277
00:14:15.311 --> 00:14:18.126
Let's click a little bit more,
we get the empty.

278
00:14:18.126 --> 00:14:22.641
If we wanted to, we could go back and
add this empty just for dexterity.

279
00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:23.941
Is it dexterity or posterity?

280
00:14:23.941 --> 00:14:28.623
So I do an empty here and then we can

281
00:14:28.623 --> 00:14:33.809
just have whatever our content is and

282
00:14:33.809 --> 00:14:39.009
just say p of no listings available.

283
00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:45.173
And then if I were to change this,
let's say carList to an empty object.

284
00:14:45.173 --> 00:14:46.639
It probably won't complain.

285
00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:48.129
We'll see.
It might not complain.

286
00:14:49.335 --> 00:14:50.979
Yeah, right, of course never.

287
00:14:50.979 --> 00:14:53.409
Of course, it's never because it's
an empty array in TypeScript.

288
00:14:53.409 --> 00:14:54.479
Of course it is.

289
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:03.041
If I could talk to the TypeScript team,
I understand why it works like that, but

290
00:15:03.041 --> 00:15:04.752
that is my least favorite feature,

291
00:15:04.752 --> 00:15:07.334
is that you can't just make
an empty array like that.

292
00:15:07.334 --> 00:15:08.294
But here, here's what we can do.

293
00:15:09.384 --> 00:15:10.774
Well, we don't need to go
any further than this.

294
00:15:10.774 --> 00:15:12.824
I don't want to spend more time
because we have more things to do.

295
00:15:12.824 --> 00:15:16.794
What I was going to do was just
take all these out for a second.

296
00:15:16.794 --> 00:15:17.454
I can comment them.

297
00:15:17.454 --> 00:15:19.144
That'll be fine for now.

298
00:15:19.144 --> 00:15:22.699
Yeah, okay, I don't want to get too
dragged down because we still have great

299
00:15:22.699 --> 00:15:23.914
stuff to learn together.

300
00:15:23.914 --> 00:15:27.056
Okay, I've changed this already,
there you go.

301
00:15:28.922 --> 00:15:32.451
What, save.

302
00:15:35.462 --> 00:15:38.901
What, okay,
I was gonna say that was weird.

303
00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:42.855
I was like, what, I think the server
was just rebooting itself or whatever.

304
00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:45.655
Okay, see, so now no listings available.

305
00:15:45.655 --> 00:15:47.425
Okay, so now you see how the empty works.

306
00:15:47.425 --> 00:15:50.026
So you've gotta experience both of those,
awesome.
