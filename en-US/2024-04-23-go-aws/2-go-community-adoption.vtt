1
00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:05.742
There may be a few recognizable faces
here, but I wanna really double down

2
00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:11.927
from a perspective of recognizing what's
going down in the environment in Tech,

3
00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:17.440
Twitter or whatever kind of
influence scope you wanna discuss.

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.088
Now is a really good time to learn Go.

5
00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:21.333
And there's some examples here.

6
00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:26.488
So in the top left, there's a small
content creator by the name of

7
00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:31.833
the Primogen, who used Rust at Netflix and
just daily exclusive for

8
00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:37.206
two years, heavy into Rust,
was known for being a Rust developer.

9
00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:41.078
And he is coming around
to using Golang in 2024.

10
00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:45.379
And in this video that he has,
it's a really great video.

11
00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.209
He describes, yes, you can do very
powerful things with Rust in 2024.

12
00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:54.077
Yes, it gives you more granular control.

13
00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:59.082
But that thinking is you're spending
more time on these optimizations, and

14
00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:03.938
these things that can get you that
extra juice from your application code.

15
00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:08.270
Whereas Go,
if you don't need that extra squeeze,

16
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.201
you can be as efficient and
even faster with Go, question?

17
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:18.112
&gt;&gt; I just feel like I need to comment
that Frontend Masters has been all

18
00:01:18.112 --> 00:01:21.629
in on Go since 2017,
and we are very happy.

19
00:01:21.629 --> 00:01:24.014
Everything is scaling beautifully, and

20
00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:27.154
we basically had to rebuild
a lot of what Netflix says.

21
00:01:27.154 --> 00:01:30.430
&gt;&gt; Yep, like we were talking about this,
I mean, Go,

22
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.427
you rarely see cases where there's
a bottleneck in how we're building stuff.

23
00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:39.395
And look at the traffic, look at what
Frontend Masters, as a best example,

24
00:01:39.395 --> 00:01:43.425
the throughput for data, all these
different sign-ups, everything, and

25
00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.711
it scales, because Go just
offers that flexibility, right?

26
00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:49.626
And you don't need a giant team.

27
00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:52.138
And I think that's really
a beautiful point.

28
00:01:52.138 --> 00:01:56.106
You don't need a giant team to write
really elegant, sufficient code.

29
00:01:56.106 --> 00:01:58.305
Go gives you the tools to do it, right?

30
00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:02.511
And I think that's why it's picking up so
much steam, because now people are like,

31
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:03.173
wait, why?

32
00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:06.711
I don't actually have to spend a full
day on this type safety mechanism,

33
00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:09.733
these base abstraction layers,
Go just kinda does it for me.

34
00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:14.602
And so that's why I think Prime and
a lot others are adopting Go.

35
00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:18.764
And then we get to more
interesting examples.

36
00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:22.999
The one in the middle,
the one that says, I'M A GO SIMP,

37
00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:27.078
this is from a great creator
by the name of Web Dev Cody.

38
00:02:27.078 --> 00:02:32.751
Web Dev Cody, this person only
created videos using Next,

39
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:38.962
using top of the line,
front end JavaScript types of stuff.

40
00:02:38.962 --> 00:02:41.623
And he made a video of
why he's learning Go.

41
00:02:41.623 --> 00:02:42.848
Again, great video.

42
00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:45.680
But in that video,
he basically talks about,

43
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.363
he's exhausted from
the types of ecosystem.

44
00:02:49.363 --> 00:02:53.700
He's exhausted from his current
day-to-day, his current tooling,

45
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.406
and his recognizing GO was just
like this breath of fresh air.

46
00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:01.261
This is just a way to explore new
features, new ways to write code.

47
00:03:01.261 --> 00:03:05.196
And if someone who's coming from this
heavy duty Web Dev background from

48
00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:08.812
a professional perspective and
a content creating perspective,

49
00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:12.616
I can just showcase that Go is
really picking up steam here.

50
00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:17.698
In this last slide, we have a creator
by the name of Theo, who basically

51
00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:24.419
is the devoice of everything TypeScript,
everything in Tech, React, all that.

52
00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.459
He makes all these videos for them, right?

53
00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.066
And he made a video of,
I'm Coming Around to Go.

54
00:03:30.066 --> 00:03:34.364
Now, this isn't a video where Theo is
going to start making Go content, but

55
00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:38.865
fun fact, Theo actually started as
an Elixir developer, than a Go developer,

56
00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:41.774
then TypeScript,
weird character development.

57
00:03:41.774 --> 00:03:45.646
But [LAUGH] he made this video
where he's recognizing, yeah,

58
00:03:45.646 --> 00:03:50.870
I still have TypeScript, but it's hard to
argue against Go at this point, right?

59
00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.038
The more you explore it,

60
00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:55.161
the more you check it out,
you recognize that you can go very fast.

61
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:59.334
The developer velocity is top
notch when it comes to Go, and

62
00:03:59.334 --> 00:04:03.183
they agree that you can pick it up very,
very quickly.

63
00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:08.103
So those are the top row, and I made this
by design, because the top row you can

64
00:04:08.103 --> 00:04:11.323
always make that argument like,
they're doing it for views.

65
00:04:11.323 --> 00:04:15.578
They wanna get more views on their videos,
and you're absolutely right,

66
00:04:15.578 --> 00:04:17.408
I don't want to abstract that.

67
00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:21.908
But if no one was interested in
Go from a viewer perspective,

68
00:04:21.908 --> 00:04:24.915
these videos would not get views.

69
00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:26.275
So there's this audience.

70
00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:31.047
There's these people who've heard it,
wanna use it, and have this itch, and

71
00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:33.555
they're resonating with these videos.

72
00:04:35.415 --> 00:04:38.144
And I really wanna focus
on this bottom row here.

73
00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:40.574
Not my update, you can ignore that one.

74
00:04:40.574 --> 00:04:42.675
I just put it there cuz I
really like the thumbnail.

75
00:04:42.675 --> 00:04:48.455
But the one to the left, why we switched
from Svelte Kit to Golang plus HTMX.

76
00:04:48.455 --> 00:04:50.905
This is already built software.

77
00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:52.315
It already had users.

78
00:04:52.315 --> 00:04:55.010
This comes from a creator Anthony GG,
right?

79
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.355
This already was deployed,
they were getting used to getting

80
00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:03.114
traffic using a very popular TypeScript
library, Svelte, which is great.

81
00:05:03.114 --> 00:05:07.488
But they made the decision to migrate away
from that to use just core Golang and

82
00:05:07.488 --> 00:05:08.374
HTMX, right?

83
00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:10.222
And HTMX plays super well with Go.

84
00:05:10.222 --> 00:05:15.280
You have this complete control of your
entire application, and it just has that

85
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.415
versatility that if you wanna be like
this back-end core developer, you don't

86
00:05:20.415 --> 00:05:25.194
need to learn a new JavaScript framework
or even JavaScript to start with.

87
00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:29.206
You can just build stuff, beautiful
applications using HTMX and Golang,

88
00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:29.850
all right?

89
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.249
And another very famous,
well, I say very famous,

90
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.080
one that interested me,
was the one in the yellow.

91
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.902
This was a content creator who built
an entire system using Python, all right?

92
00:05:43.902 --> 00:05:47.666
Very popular language, I'm sure all of
us have used it, heard of it, whatever.

93
00:05:47.666 --> 00:05:51.946
And they were using Python for
their pipelines, for ML pipelines, right?

94
00:05:51.946 --> 00:05:54.684
And they moved to Go, all right?

95
00:05:54.684 --> 00:05:58.764
They've used the Go routines,
they've used the ability of Go.

96
00:05:58.764 --> 00:06:02.926
So all of this is to say, that if so
many different individuals,

97
00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:07.399
engineers from different wakes of life,
you have the front-ends,

98
00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.715
the Pythons,
these Rust developers, whatever,

99
00:06:10.715 --> 00:06:15.570
are coming together at really the same
time, this period of time in tech and

100
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.694
saying, yeah, Go has something
I think is very interesting.

101
00:06:19.694 --> 00:06:22.335
I just think it emphasizes that
right now is a really good time.

102
00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:25.653
So you have to pick it up, learn it,
see any opportunities, and

103
00:06:25.653 --> 00:06:29.842
I just think it's gonna be growing more
and more with all of this adoption, yes.

104
00:06:29.842 --> 00:06:33.180
&gt;&gt; I was just gonna add,
you talked about who made Go,

105
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.873
two of those guys worked at Bell Labs-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

106
00:06:36.873 --> 00:06:41.380
&gt;&gt; Invented UNIX and Grep.

107
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:46.537
It's very cool, very solid,
computing until now.

108
00:06:46.537 --> 00:06:48.681
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, thank you for that.

109
00:06:48.681 --> 00:06:50.146
I should have added that.

110
00:06:50.146 --> 00:06:55.576
Those individuals aren't just known for
working at Google or making Golang,

111
00:06:55.576 --> 00:07:01.537
they're some of the smartest individuals
in computer science, in theory.

112
00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:03.934
So, please search them up, check them out,

113
00:07:03.934 --> 00:07:07.672
cuz these are some heavyweights
when it comes to programming, okay?

114
00:07:07.672 --> 00:07:09.099
Awesome, thanks for having that in.
