00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.193
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So
let's go define our hungry interval.

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Function,
get hungry interval.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.080
So how long should we give our users,

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.640
like the how long of a window should
they have to get there, clicking?

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Two to five seconds.

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.361
I think I had in here just two seconds,
but if you want to do two to five.

8
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, let's do that.

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.887
That sounds fun to me.

10
00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:40.070
+Math.floor(Math.random) times

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.720
3,000 + 2000.

12
00:00:56.488 --> 00:01:00.302
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Right,
this will give us two to five seconds.

13
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Cuz this will be
a number of between zero and 3,000 and

14
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.040
this will always be 2,000, right?

15
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.324
So you will get anywhere
from 2,000 to 5,000.

16
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Now we have, where are we?

17
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.292
GetHungryInterval, that's gonna be good.

18
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Last thing
up here is we need a break.

19
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.082
We're gonna do case hungry,
which is our last case.
