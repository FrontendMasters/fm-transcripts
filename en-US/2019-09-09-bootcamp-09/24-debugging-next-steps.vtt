00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.497
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you can see here,
now our moles are actually coming and

2
00:00:02.497 --> 00:00:03.157
going, right?

3
00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:13.062
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Has anyone seen this?

4
00:00:16.513 --> 00:00:17.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Check your console.

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.067
That's probably the first thing I
would check to see what kind of errors

6
00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:20.718
you're getting.

7
00:00:30.573 --> 00:00:33.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The game's not
interactive yet at all, right?

8
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.450
Because we haven't done the feed ability,
right?

9
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.330
I'm clicking on this mole right here,
and it's not doing anything.

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.504
But the generic just going through
its normal life cycle is working.

11
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.408
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah?

12
00:00:47.408 --> 00:00:51.282
&gt;&gt; Student1: I'm seeing a kind
of jarring with each animation,

13
00:00:51.282 --> 00:00:56.056
like something funky with the CSS,
or whenever one pops up like

14
00:00:56.056 --> 00:01:00.560
expands the whole roll a little,
like the entire page.

15
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.788
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My guess is
that you probably have.

16
00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:07.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
it should look like this right?

17
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.021
It's probably problem with your HTML,
that would be my guess.

18
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:11.200
&gt;&gt; Student1: Okay.

19
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's a whole container
inside the whole container, is the whole.

20
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.700
And inside the hole is the image.

21
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.680
My guess is that you probably have
something like the image is next to

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.960
the hole or something like that,
or it's next to the container.

23
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.627
But if they're not in that same
relationship, that might cause issues.

24
00:01:28.627 --> 00:01:29.777
&gt;&gt; Student1: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If it's not that,

25
00:01:29.777 --> 00:01:31.370
then it's your CSS somewhere.

26
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.239
&gt;&gt; Student1: I think I see why.

27
00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:36.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, yeah, go ahead.

28
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.571
&gt;&gt; Student1: When are we supposed
to call the next frame function?

29
00:01:40.364 --> 00:01:41.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next frame.

30
00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:42.749
&gt;&gt; Student1: Just immediately?

31
00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:43.647
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

32
00:01:47.111 --> 00:01:51.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you have to
kind of start it out next frame.

33
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.840
You have to call it once.

34
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.970
And then at the bottom here, make sure
you have this request animation frame.

35
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.983
Otherwise it's gonna run once and
never run again.

36
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.078
&gt;&gt; Student2: That's why you're talking
about it as a slow infinite loop.

37
00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:14.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

38
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.569
&gt;&gt; Student2: Cuz you
want it to [INAUDIBLE].

39
00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.790
Wouldn't ever think there'd be a use for
an infinite loop, but it makes sense.

40
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
it's not necessarily a totally

41
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.420
accurate model to think of it as,
but I mean, or maybe it is, right?

42
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.884
It is a loop that just runs forever.

43
00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:37.627
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whereas if you do like a
while true loop, it'll crash your browser.
