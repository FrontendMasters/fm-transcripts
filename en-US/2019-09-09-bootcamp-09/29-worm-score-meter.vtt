WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.329
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so now we have kings,
and that whole system is working as well.

2
00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:09.060
We are almost done.

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.553
We have one more thing to do,

4
00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:13.993
which is we have a little score
meter that we wanna add to our game.

5
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's go add our little worm container,

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.798
Let me grab that from the HTML,
what that looks like.

7
00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:26.987
So index.

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And the first
thing before the first container,

9
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.840
I'm gonna add something,
a little bit of HTML.

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.820
And this is gonna be
the div class = worm-box.

11
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, inside of that,
I'm gonna have a div.

12
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.190
And the class of that's
going to be worm-container.

13
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.580
And the image is gonna
be of source ./worm.png.

14
00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.090
And this is gonna be the worm score meter.

15
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.550
And the class here is worm.

16
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.250
Okay, Save and refresh here.

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.783
You can see it now we have a nice
little wormy guy at the top.

18
00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:27.358
Let's go add some CSS to make
sure that we get all of that.

19
00:01:27.358 --> 00:01:32.797
So mole.css.

20
00:01:32.797 --> 00:01:36.410
It's a couple more lines here
to add at the end, worm.

21
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.949
So we're going to fix the worm
at width 1660 pixels.

22
00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:46.900
Because what's going to
happen is this worm,

23
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.270
we're going to make it always
the entire length of the screen.

24
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.590
But we're going to use a div that's going
to slowly expand to show pieces of it.

25
00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.050
And using that overflow hidden,
we're going to be able to slowly reveal

26
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.030
parts of the worm as people progress
more and more into the game.

27
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.629
Make sense?

28
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.631
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we fixed the worm at that width.

29
00:02:14.977 --> 00:02:20.637
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The worm-container
is going to

30
00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:27.349
be overflow: hidden; transition.

31
00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.090
We'll look at the transition
here in just a second.

32
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.268
We'll leave that off for now, and

33
00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:35.585
then the worm box is also
gonna have that same width.

34
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the difference
between worm box and worm container?

35
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the worm box is going to be

36
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.870
what we're gonna have take up
the entire width of the screen.

37
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.530
If we have variable width,
it might wrap onto the next line.

38
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.060
It would also not,
we want the worm to stay fixed

39
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.130
in the sense that the head is
always gonna be on the left.

40
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.920
If we didn't fix the width,
and have both the worm box and

41
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.590
the worm then it would expand from
the center which is not what we want.

42
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.540
So I think it'll be a little more concrete
once we see the animation here happen.

43
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.740
So we have this.

44
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.040
We want the user to start
out with zero score right?

45
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:38.533
So we're gonna say here is
on the worm container here.

46
00:03:38.533 --> 00:03:43.648
We're gonna say width equals 5% or

47
00:03:43.648 --> 00:03:49.430
sorry, rather style equals width 5%.

48
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.360
So now notice it starts with just
a little head right here, right?

49
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.998
And if we didn't have the worm
container kind of expanding and

50
00:03:57.998 --> 00:04:02.880
contracting there, then you would
be be able to see the entire worm.

51
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.816
Makes sense?

52
00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:11.247
It's a little bit of some advanced CSS,
but

53
00:04:11.247 --> 00:04:16.254
we're using this container to kind of,
see if we can actually,

54
00:04:16.254 --> 00:04:20.540
let's do this,
kind of explore what these are doing.

55
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.924
So
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Specter.

56
00:04:31.715 --> 00:04:34.167
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I look here at

57
00:04:34.167 --> 00:04:40.210
the worm,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

58
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.250
the worm box takes up that whole
top half of the page, right?

59
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.510
Then I'm using the worm container to
only show a tiny, tiny piece of it.

60
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.610
And then as the user scores more and
more points.

61
00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see.

62
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.770
Here on the worm container.

63
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.530
We're going to expand this
worm container like that so

64
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.610
that we can show more and
more of the worm.

65
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.968
Just by changing the width
on that worm container.

66
00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:13.939
And it's important that we keep this
worm as well fixed at 1660 pixels,

67
00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:18.920
cuz if we didn't have this, it would
try and squish it into wherever it was.

68
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.869
Does that makes sense, sort of?

69
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah it's similar to
what you were talking about earlier

70
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.990
where something goes off the screen, and

71
00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.830
you could theoretically make
it scrollable I suppose right?

72
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, that's exactly it.

73
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.492
So if we came to worm container and make
this scroll, now you could probably if I

74
00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:44.706
can get my mouse on it, you can
scroll through the worm right here.

75
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're basically just
creating like an artificial window using

76
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.580
CSS, right?

77
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.610
Then you can only see the worm
as it's exposed right here.

78
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Technically you already won,
because it's all there,

79
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.090
it's just not showing it to you.

80
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, exactly.

81
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.250
So technically they start
with zero points, right?

82
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.880
So we would have this worm at 0%.

83
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.680
But I thought it was
a little bit better so

84
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.600
that the user could initially
see something right.

85
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.330
So they could tell that that's
where the meter started, right?

86
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.590
So that's why I started that 5%,
just you can see the little frowny face.

87
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.718
Now what we're going to do,
if we come back to our game JS.

88
00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:32.504
Whenever a user scores, we're gonna adjust
to this the the width of that container.

89
00:06:32.504 --> 00:06:36.793
So what we're going to say,

90
00:06:36.793 --> 00:06:42.693
here in mole.js, worm.container,

91
00:06:42.693 --> 00:06:49.665
worm container rather, let's just do this,

92
00:06:49.665 --> 00:06:57.192
document.querySelector.worm-container,

93
00:06:58.735 --> 00:07:01.666
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .style.width

94
00:07:01.666 --> 00:07:05.103
=,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna use back

95
00:07:05.103 --> 00:07:05.693
ticks there.

96
00:07:05.693 --> 00:07:13.124
I'm gonna say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 10*score%.

97
00:07:20.019 --> 00:07:24.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, because score
is going to be number from zero.

98
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.720
Well, it's gonna start at zero but
this is never firing zero.

99
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.654
So it's gonna be a number from 1 to 10.

100
00:07:30.654 --> 00:07:37.760
So whenever user hits,
correctly clicks on the mole,

101
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.098
it'll expand it to 3 times 10%, so 30%.

102
00:07:44.098 --> 00:07:48.018
So if I refresh again here,
now if we click on one of these,

103
00:07:48.018 --> 00:07:51.620
it should expand a little
worm friend there, right.

104
00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now your users have an
indication of where they are in the game.

105
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.340
And you can see that when you click on
a king mole, it expands even further.

106
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:07.660
And then until you win.
