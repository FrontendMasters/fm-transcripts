WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.737
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna
pick up where we left off.

2
00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:07.665
Right now we have them kind of cycling
through all their various states, but

3
00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:09.669
we still can't click on them.

4
00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.482
So we're gonna go ahead and
work on the feed method now.

5
00:00:16.314 --> 00:00:19.021
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
I'm gonna come down here,

6
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna add an event

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.046
listener,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Down here near the bottom.

8
00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:32.714
And we're just gonna say document.get

9
00:00:32.714 --> 00:00:37.112
element by ID, nope query selector.

10
00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:43.058
Query selector,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .bg,

11
00:00:43.058 --> 00:00:46.821
so we are gonna listen for
events at the background level, right.

12
00:00:46.821 --> 00:00:50.724
So anything that happens inside of
this background we're gonna add

13
00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:55.278
an event listener,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That whenever

14
00:00:55.278 --> 00:00:59.718
someone clicks on it we're
gonna call a feed method

15
00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:04.269
that we're about to write or
feed function rather.

16
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.337
Okay, so line 119 there,

17
00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:10.771
that's one I wrote,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Document.querySelector('

18
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:14.213
.bg ').addEventListener(
click' go to feed):.

19
00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.387
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then here underneath this I'm gonna put

20
00:01:21.387 --> 00:01:25.931
a method called function
feed that takes an event.

21
00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:34.615
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And just to show you, we're
gonna log out the event.current target,

22
00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.666
not current target but rather target,

23
00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:41.924
target,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To show you what that

24
00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:44.808
looks like, so we can make sure
to grab the right element.

25
00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:48.181
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I go in here to

26
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:52.814
the console,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see

27
00:01:52.814 --> 00:01:57.812
here that depending on where I click
different things are gonna be called.

28
00:01:57.812 --> 00:02:03.661
And only when I click on the mole hungry,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is that

29
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:09.145
going to allow us to get the right mole?

30
00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:13.134
So, we're gonna have to check
whenever someone clicks on,

31
00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:17.216
whenever a feed happens right,
if we go back over to our code.

32
00:02:17.216 --> 00:02:21.488
We have to check whenever someone clicks
on the event we have to make sure that

33
00:02:21.488 --> 00:02:24.451
they're actually gonna click on an image,
right?

34
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.654
So the first question I'm gonna ask here,

35
00:02:28.654 --> 00:02:33.677
if (event.target.tagname
is not equal to IMG,

36
00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:37.553
remember, this is always all in caps.

37
00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:41.724
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then we're going to return,
right?

38
00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:46.574
If they didn't click on an image
then they definitely didn't click on

39
00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:49.213
one of these moles over here, right?

40
00:02:54.284 --> 00:02:55.839
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's the first thing.

41
00:02:55.839 --> 00:03:00.730
The next question we need to ask
if they did click on an image was

42
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.246
that mole hungry?

43
00:03:02.246 --> 00:03:06.519
Now there's a couple of ways
we could look for that.

44
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.232
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we can say,

45
00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:16.440
or, which is what the two bars mean,

46
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:25.185
(event.target.classList.contains("hungr-
y").

47
00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:33.627
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And doesn't, so actually,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

48
00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:37.611
here in front of event I'm
gonna put exclamation point.

49
00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:40.884
[COUGH] So let's talk about that
line there for just a second.

50
00:03:43.872 --> 00:03:46.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The first thing here, we're
gonna make sure it's an image, right?

51
00:03:46.281 --> 00:03:49.509
If it's not an image,
we're just going to return.

52
00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:55.059
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The second thing we're
gonna check is we're gonna make sure was

53
00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:56.105
it a hungry mole?

54
00:03:58.538 --> 00:04:02.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if it's not a hungry
mole, which is what the exclamation point,

55
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.470
right?

56
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.296
That's what the explanation
says not right?

57
00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:07.783
So if the classes does not contain hungry,

58
00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:12.560
then we're not gonna run any of this
functionality and we're just gonna return.

59
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.404
So now if I Save this and
Refresh over here,

60
00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:20.622
notice that it'll only be logged out here
if I click on one of the hungry moles.

61
00:04:20.622 --> 00:04:24.883
So there, that one I was able to click on,
I'm clicking on other things and

62
00:04:24.883 --> 00:04:27.941
then there you can see again
that it logs out, right?

63
00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.913
So we’re only getting
hungry moles down here.

64
00:04:35.093 --> 00:04:38.453
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now that we’re
down here I’m guaranteed at 109,

65
00:04:38.453 --> 00:04:41.100
that they clicked on a hungry mole, right?

66
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.654
So now we’re gonna have to go do
all the things to move them from

67
00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:48.118
hungry to the fed state, right?

68
00:04:48.118 --> 00:04:52.502
That's when they have the worm
hanging out of their mouth.

69
00:04:55.942 --> 00:04:58.929
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or
I can even show you here, this one.

70
00:04:58.929 --> 00:04:59.712
So that's when they've been fed.

71
00:05:03.988 --> 00:05:07.951
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the thing first where
it says mole.status = 'fed' right?

72
00:05:10.626 --> 00:05:12.368
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mole.next.

73
00:05:12.368 --> 00:05:16.100
So how long are we gonna
show them the happy face?.

74
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.428
And I just did it with
the same getSadInterval.

75
00:05:19.428 --> 00:05:22.182
So I'll show it to him for a second or
a half second, whatever you chose to do.

76
00:05:25.172 --> 00:05:27.236
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

77
00:05:27.236 --> 00:05:33.677
And your gonna say
mole.node.children[0].src,

78
00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:43.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: '=./mole-fed.png'.

79
00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:50.506
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you're also going to

80
00:05:50.506 --> 00:05:55.060
remove,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The hungry, right?

81
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.221
Because it has the hungry class on it,
it no longer is hungry at this point.

82
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:04.888
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Where is mole coming from?

83
00:06:07.312 --> 00:06:12.039
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have to grab it, I didn't
do that yet, so const mole, thank you.

84
00:06:14.484 --> 00:06:17.994
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If they click on this image

85
00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:19.035
right here, right?

86
00:06:21.941 --> 00:06:23.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do we know
which one they clicked on?

87
00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:28.928
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,
we had this data index right there, right?

88
00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.403
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we know that they clicked index 6,

89
00:06:33.403 --> 00:06:36.000
that's why we put that
there in the first place.

90
00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.086
So what we're gonna say is

91
00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:49.044
moles(event.target.DataSet.index),
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

92
00:06:51.084 --> 00:06:55.842
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now this isn't quite it,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because if you

93
00:06:55.842 --> 00:07:01.277
remember,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Store

94
00:07:01.277 --> 00:07:04.132
as global variable, temp0.

95
00:07:04.132 --> 00:07:06.985
So, temp0 is this particular
little image right there, right.

96
00:07:06.985 --> 00:07:10.609
You can see the one that I
have highlighted right there.

97
00:07:10.609 --> 00:07:14.885
So if I say temp0,
let's make this a little bit bigger so

98
00:07:14.885 --> 00:07:21.266
you can see it,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Temp0.dataset.index,

99
00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:24.210
you can see it's 6 right?

100
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.287
But, what's the the problem with that?

101
00:07:27.287 --> 00:07:28.935
It's a string right?

102
00:07:28.935 --> 00:07:30.721
It's not a number it's a string right?

103
00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:34.126
Because we a pulling it out of the dom,
we had the problem previously right?

104
00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:39.477
So we have to turn this into a number
just like we did with the calculator.

105
00:07:39.477 --> 00:07:46.774
So easy enough, parseInt,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that.

106
00:07:49.824 --> 00:07:52.807
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now this mole
will be the one that we clicked on,

107
00:07:52.807 --> 00:07:54.807
as represented up here, right?

108
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:56.857
So we can get a handle on that one.

109
00:07:56.857 --> 00:07:57.729
That make sense?

110
00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.565
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
what happens in the game now for

111
00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:07.105
you when you click on
the moles to feed them?

112
00:08:07.105 --> 00:08:12.511
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, it's gonna kinda
break the game cuz I haven't really

113
00:08:12.511 --> 00:08:18.899
drawn it full circle yet, but it should
show a fed mole if I click on it.

114
00:08:18.899 --> 00:08:19.839
And now they're disappearing.

115
00:08:23.231 --> 00:08:26.001
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right,
glad it's not just me.

116
00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:37.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Probably because,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

117
00:08:37.113 --> 00:08:39.944
let's close the loop here
cuz I think it doesn't

118
00:08:39.944 --> 00:08:43.963
know what to do with fed because we
haven't provided for fed up here.

119
00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:52.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 6, 0, okay, so
that looks like it's working, right?

120
00:08:52.851 --> 00:08:55.763
It's getting the correct number, so

121
00:08:55.763 --> 00:09:01.041
that should be getting the correct mole,
mole.status = 'fed',

122
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:06.232
mole.next = SadInterval,
children[0] src =./mole fed.

123
00:09:06.232 --> 00:09:09.559
Okay, and that looks like it
all should be working fine.
