00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.362
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if a mole was gone and
it's next comes up again,

2
00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:10.097
that means it's going to go to hungry,
right?

3
00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:18.062
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the mole status here
is going to be mole.status = hungry.

4
00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:27.484
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: mole.next
= getHungryInterval.

5
00:00:27.484 --> 00:00:29.997
We'll have to decide how long that is.

6
00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:43.205
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
here we're gonna have to say,

7
00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:48.780
it's kind of the same thing up here,
moles, no children all that stuff.

8
00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.752
Remember, we wanted to have it
like have the bird come over it,

9
00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:58.160
if the mole's hungry, so
we have to add a class here.

10
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.960
So, class list.add hungry.

11
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.848
And we're going to have to remove,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make it a little smaller.

12
00:01:09.848 --> 00:01:15.849
Remove, gone, right,
cuz it's no longer gone.

13
00:01:23.678 --> 00:01:24.870
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Call it up there.

14
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.008
So mole.children.class,
we need to change the source

15
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:39.524
here as well to be equal
to ./mole-hungry.png.

16
00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:46.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you need to do that
with the children or just mole.node.src?

17
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I messed 77 up.

18
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.380
So it does have to be this, this is wrong.

19
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.075
Because, again, the node that we're
referring to is the one that we have,

20
00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:00.710
mole.node is this one the whole.

21
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.180
We actually need to grab the child.

22
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.060
Yeah, yep, yep, yep.

23
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.540
So, line 77 there, we're actually
gonna have to say mole.node.children.

24
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.802
Same thing that we were doing up there,
children.0.
