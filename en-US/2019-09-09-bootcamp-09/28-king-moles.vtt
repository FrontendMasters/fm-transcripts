00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.260
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, there's two
more things we got to do after this.

2
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.940
We're going to do the king moles,
right because those are worth two points.

3
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.354
And we're gonna do the score meter

4
00:00:16.354 --> 00:00:20.915
at the top with the worm, okay.

5
00:00:24.663 --> 00:00:27.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's go do the king moles first.

6
00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:35.349
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the first thing we need
to do is we need to generate moles that

7
00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:36.703
are king moles.

8
00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:43.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So coming back here.

9
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.896
And the king moles have
little crowns on them and

10
00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:47.975
they are worth double points
if you click on them.

11
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:57.278
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So under mole.gone,
the other thing we are gonna say here is

12
00:00:57.278 --> 00:01:05.137
we're gonna say mole.king
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: getKingStatus

13
00:01:10.891 --> 00:01:11.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, I'm gonna

14
00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.303
write a function up there that's going to
randomly assign it to be either a king or

15
00:01:16.303 --> 00:01:16.968
not a king.

16
00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I guess we could've called
this royal or something like that.

17
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.223
Probably something less gender specific,
sorry.

18
00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:34.285
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But we'll stick with it for
now, cuz I'd have to change a lot.

19
00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:41.155
So function getKingStatus.

20
00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:44.640
So this should return either true or
false.

21
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.830
True if it is a king,
false if it's not a king.

22
00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.490
And we want to make about
10% of them be kings.

23
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.621
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna say math.random.

24
00:01:55.621 --> 00:02:00.561
If you remember, return rather,
return math.random.

25
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:04.320
Math.random returns a random number
between zero and one, right?

26
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.130
Some decimal between that,
it's roughly uniform distributed.

27
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.801
It's not, it's pseudo random,
it's not random.

28
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:16.350
But it's close enough for our purposes.

29
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.100
So if we asked if math.random
is greater than 0.9,

30
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.616
that would mean roughly 90% of the time,
it would come back as false.

31
00:02:27.616 --> 00:02:31.962
And 0.1, or 10% of the time,
it would come back as true.

32
00:02:34.447 --> 00:02:35.101
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes sense?

33
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna come
back down here to our game, and gone.

34
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.251
So this is where we're getting whether or
not it's a new king.

35
00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:54.562
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're determining
that when it comes in as hungry, right?

36
00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:04.590
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, we have all these
places where we're setting the background.

37
00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.060
Whenever we're setting a background,
we have to check if it's the king or not.

38
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.280
If it is the king, then we have
to show a different mole, right?

39
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.560
We have to use a different background.

40
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.106
So every time that you see that
we're just gonna have to say if

41
00:03:19.106 --> 00:03:25.285
(mole.king)
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

42
00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:31.210
it's gonna look really similar, but
it's just gonna say mole-king-hungry.

43
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.530
I think this is mole king, no, king mole.

44
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.070
So king mole hungry else that, right?

45
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.520
Otherwise the mole is just normal.

46
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.020
So if I refresh this,
some of these will come up as kings.

47
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.500
The rest of the animations
are going to work yet, but

48
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.680
you should see at least some
of them coming up as kings.

49
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.270
See, so that one is, but
then when it goes, yeah, it'll disappear.

50
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.460
So we have to go to the rest of them.

51
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.740
That makes sense though how
we're getting king moles?

52
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.200
So let's just go do the rest of these.

53
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.394
So if mole leaving then we
have to say if mole.king

54
00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:23.791
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Else

55
00:04:27.793 --> 00:04:28.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

56
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.866
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: king-mole-leaving.png.

57
00:04:39.082 --> 00:04:41.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And where else?

58
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.250
So that one, we have hungry and
this is when we have sad, so

59
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.433
we have to have sad kings as well.

60
00:04:47.433 --> 00:04:54.310
If mole.king,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Else,

61
00:04:59.378 --> 00:05:03.996
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We have king-mole.sad

62
00:05:08.713 --> 00:05:10.199
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then last one down

63
00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.930
here in fed, we have to do that as well.

64
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:19.724
So if (mole.king)
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Else

65
00:05:26.474 --> 00:05:29.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: king-mole-fed.

66
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.840
So now if we refresh this,

67
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.300
hopefully it should go through
the whole cycle for all the kings.

68
00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.020
So there's one, and when it leaves,
you can see it's sad and

69
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.930
you can see also the little
hat in the background.

70
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.390
And then if I feed one of them,
you can see it has its happy face and

71
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.450
everything like that.

72
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.000
Right now they just look different.

73
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.100
But we're not giving many different score.

74
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:56.380
So down in fed, we have to check
if mole.king here as well.

75
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.744
In fact we can just
reuse this one up here.

76
00:06:01.697 --> 00:06:03.779
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
if the mole is not a king,

77
00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:07.071
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then we just add one to

78
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:08.710
the score.

79
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.023
And if the mole is a king,
then we're gonna

80
00:06:12.023 --> 00:06:16.837
say score += 2,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or

81
00:06:16.837 --> 00:06:19.509
score = score + 2, if you prefer.

82
00:06:21.462 --> 00:06:25.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, because king moles
are worth double in our little game here.
