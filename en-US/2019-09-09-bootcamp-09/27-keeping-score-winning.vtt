00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're close.

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.966
Now all the animations and showing up and
going away, that's all working.

3
00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:08.460
But now we need to keep
track of the score.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.881
So we're gonna say,

5
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:17.012
we'll put it up here at the top,

6
00:00:17.012 --> 00:00:20.251
let's score = 0.

7
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And when they get to
ten points, they're going to win.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.820
So you can keep track of
points however you want to.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.000
I think in my notes I have
it at increments of ten, but

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.290
there's not reason why we
couldn't just do it by one.

11
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.049
So if
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Score is greater than or

12
00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:48.130
equal to 10, then win the game, all right?

13
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.500
The win method here in just a second.

14
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.610
And then up here we're
gonna say score plus plus.

15
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.850
So they're going to get one point for

16
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.780
every time that they
click on one of these.

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.522
Once they get to 10 points
then they're gonna win.

18
00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:02.661
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is
in the feed function?

19
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.714
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm,
bottom of the feed function.

20
00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:14.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, good so far?

21
00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:25.687
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, underneath that
we're gonna create a function called win.

22
00:01:30.201 --> 00:01:37.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And all we're gonna
do with the win function is we're

23
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.401
gonna say
document.get.querySelector.bg and

24
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:50.390
we're going to say, class list.ad hide.

25
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.659
And then relatively similar, we're going
to have another thing called the win

26
00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.631
screen and
we're going to remove hide from it.

27
00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:02.237
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we're gonna go
have to create both of those things.

28
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:12.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
it just wrote that right there.

29
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.310
Now we're gonna go into our styles and
we're gonna add two things here.

30
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.742
One of them is gonna be called
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hide,

31
00:02:21.742 --> 00:02:23.610
that's what we called it.

32
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.108
So hide is gonna be display none, whatever
has hide on it is not gonna show up.

33
00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:33.384
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So honestly,

34
00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:36.270
we have gone up here,
we could have just reused that as well.

35
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.940
But because those are kind
of semantically differnet,

36
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.700
I'm going to keep them
as separate classes.

37
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.280
But you could have also just have
done something like this as well.

38
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.750
Or you could just use gone
in both places as well.

39
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.330
I'm fine with any one of those solutions.

40
00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.469
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we'll just keep it like that for now.

41
00:03:02.187 --> 00:03:05.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
now we're gonna go into our index.html.

42
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.350
We're gonna add an image
down here at the bottom.

43
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.436
Its source is going to be ./win.png,

44
00:03:15.436 --> 00:03:18.730
and you've won the game.

45
00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:28.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
it's going to have a class of win.

46
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.997
And as well as we don't show it initially,
so we're gonna have it be hide.

47
00:03:43.435 --> 00:03:47.925
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now hopefully, if we
refresh this and we click on ten of these,

48
00:03:52.944 --> 00:03:55.972
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One, two, three, four,

49
00:03:55.972 --> 00:04:00.712
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

50
00:04:00.712 --> 00:04:05.337
and you get a happy
little mole at the end.

51
00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:12.853
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You might put it to
like two or three if you're testing,

52
00:04:12.853 --> 00:04:15.888
rather than make yourself have to
click through ten every single time.

53
00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:27.241
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
when we add the hide to the background,

54
00:04:27.241 --> 00:04:30.860
that's going to hide basically
the entire game board.

55
00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.330
Which is why all that stuff has gone away.

56
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.280
And now, it's just the win screen.
