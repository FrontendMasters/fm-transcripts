00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.011
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The page
here is actually only,

2
00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:04.630
that has a lot of vertical space
that it could be taking up.

3
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.757
And honestly, this is fine.

4
00:00:05.757 --> 00:00:06.870
We could leave it like this.

5
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.420
But I'll show you kind of a little hack,

6
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.030
that you can get it to take
the whole height of a page.

7
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.110
You can do height, 100 vh.

8
00:00:18.765 --> 00:00:22.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now,
it's vertically centered, as well.

9
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.070
So, let's talk about what vh is.

10
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.090
One, vh is only gonna work
in really new browsers.

11
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.940
So, if you're gonna use a vh, be careful,

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.060
if you're trying to
support older browsers.

13
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.000
Right?

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.920
But what it means is my
browser is 100 vh tall.

15
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.757
And so, if I say, 100 vh,
it says take 100% of what's

16
00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:46.582
available in the,
this is called the viewport.

17
00:00:46.582 --> 00:00:48.390
So it's saying take 100% of the viewport.

18
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.963
If I said something like 80 vh,
it'd say, okay,

19
00:00:51.963 --> 00:00:55.710
take 80% of the available view height.

20
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.892
So, now, if I refresh this,
it's going to move up, just a tiny bit.

21
00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:03.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, again,
what this is doing,

22
00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:08.680
it's saying the body should take
100% of the user's viewport.

23
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.210
And then, here, I'm saying center it.

24
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.584
That's why it ends up sitting directly
in the middle of the viewport.

25
00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:16.919
Make sense?

26
00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:20.192
It's kind of a nice trick.

27
00:01:20.192 --> 00:01:22.820
You could here, as well, if you wanted to,

28
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.030
do 100 vw,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: which does not stand for

29
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.806
Volkswagen.

30
00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:32.018
It stands for
100% of the view width, as well.

31
00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:33.353
Right?
And that would work, as well.

32
00:01:33.353 --> 00:01:35.962
But it already does that,
so it's superfluous.

33
00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:41.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

34
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.180
So this is coming along already better.

35
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.680
Right?
