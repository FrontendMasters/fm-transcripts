00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just to go a little
bit further with CSS animations,

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.978
just to add a nice little touch to it.

3
00:00:03.978 --> 00:00:09.035
Here, we're in container,
there's a property called transition,

4
00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:13.330
which says, hey,
if I change the width from 5% to 10%,

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.972
do just a nice animation
between those two states.

6
00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:20.588
And usually the browser is pretty
good about doing stuff like that,

7
00:00:20.588 --> 00:00:24.585
animating heights and widths, and
paddings, and margins, and colors,

8
00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:26.370
and some other things like that.

9
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.794
So what we can say is, we can say,
transition: width, and

10
00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:33.640
let me make sure I just get that right.

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.252
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We want this to take about.

12
00:00:39.252 --> 00:00:40.813
You can decide how long
you want it to take.

13
00:00:40.813 --> 00:00:47.190
I'm gonna put it at 0.5 seconds,
and I want it to ease in and out.

14
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.110
You can have it be linear so it moves
steadily, but I'm gonna have it so

15
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.242
it goes out and then it slows down.

16
00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:58.455
Almost like a ball bouncing.

17
00:00:58.455 --> 00:01:01.374
It's fast when it hits the bottom, and
then when it hits the top it slows down,

18
00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:03.910
and then it goes back down,
that's what ease in and out looks like.

19
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.676
So now if I say that, and
I refresh the page here.

20
00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:13.613
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, if I can click on it,
you can see that the worm will move

21
00:01:13.613 --> 00:01:16.852
a little bit slower, it will actually
have a nice little animation to it.

22
00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:21.801
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is pretty cool,
right?

23
00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:28.251
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Man,
I'm striking out, this game's hard.

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.325
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Until I win.

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.782
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that, my friends,
is it, that's the whole game.

26
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
how do you feel about this?

27
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.340
Hopefully that questions is like,
this is really hard,

28
00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.914
but the concepts hopefully make
sense that, given enough time and

29
00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:59.709
caffeine you could write this, or
wine, depending how you feel about it.

30
00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.476
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But yeah, we just coded
a game from start to finish together.

31
00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:11.547
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Took us
about 70 lines of CSS, and

32
00:02:11.547 --> 00:02:16.690
about 175 lines of code, it's not too bad.
