00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.858
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,I guess there
is one more thing on here that

2
00:00:01.858 --> 00:00:03.580
I had not talked about.

3
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.675
Did Jen talk about data
attributes on HTML?

4
00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:11.700
Okay, well, let's come back over here.

5
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.028
Right now we have a bunch of moles
showing up, including some more lutts.

6
00:00:16.028 --> 00:00:21.375
If I inspect element on this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

7
00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:25.282
want inspector, rules, layout.

8
00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:30.498
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's put this
on the side and dock to right.

9
00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:38.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
here you notice it has its data-index="0".

10
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.410
There's a cool trick that
you can do with HTML.

11
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.926
So if I come in here and say,

12
00:00:44.926 --> 00:00:49.659
mole = document.querySelector.

13
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:52.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And what did I call them?

14
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.286
I called them moles, right?

15
00:00:56.286 --> 00:01:01.606
Hopefully, class="mole", okay, .mole.

16
00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:06.130
So now mole is equal to this
king element right there, right?

17
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.960
So I'm gonna have 12 different
moles on the page and

18
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.480
it's gonna matter which one I click on,
right?

19
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.140
Because I have to not show that one, and

20
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.130
I have to operate individually
on each different mole.

21
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.155
It'd be annoying to go bind
to 12 event listeners,

22
00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.690
that's not at all what I wanna do.

23
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.592
So it'd be cool if I could tell
which one I was clicking on, and

24
00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:30.100
this data-index is gonna
help us with that.

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:38.190
So if I say mole.dataset.index,

26
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.110
I'm gonna get whatever the data- is.

27
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.770
So it's basically a variable
that you're keeping in the HTML.

28
00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:56.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go back here and
say mole, querySelectorAll.

29
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.299
So now I have all of them in here, right?

30
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.182
So if I do moles of the fifth one on the
page, or it would be the sixth one rather,

31
00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:11.730
data set.index, notice that that's five.

32
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.530
So now I can tell them apart
easily in the JavaScript.

33
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.190
And it doesn't have to be called,
It can be data dash, whatever right?

34
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.716
For example, if I come back over
here to the top one and I say data,

35
00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:35.779
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: -some-other-thing="this

36
00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.791
is cool".

37
00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:43.349
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now if I come
back over here and refresh, and

38
00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.970
I grab that mole again.

39
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.330
So now if I save
mole.dataset.some other thing,

40
00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.747
notice I can get this is cool out
of the out of the HTML there.

41
00:02:58.747 --> 00:02:59.800
Does that make sense?

42
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.512
So now it's really easy for me to tell
these moles apart in my JavaScript.

43
00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:13.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So notice that this
is data-some-other-thing, right?

44
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.670
And then here when I reference it,
the way that I do it, it's in case, and

45
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.470
you also don't include the data in there.

46
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And dataset is the method
that gets anything with the prefix data?

47
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Data dash.

48
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Data dash.

49
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, that's exactly it.

50
00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.114
Okay, so that's what those
data dash indexes are for.
