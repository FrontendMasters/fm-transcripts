00:00:00.643 --> 00:00:03.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's come back over here and keep going.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.450
We'll come back into the the worm later,
as well as the, yeah.

3
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:20.988
So now I'm gonna put a link tag in
here link source = ./styles.css.

4
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:29.178
And I am going to create a new file
in here at college styles.css.

5
00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:31.770
So let me get here my notes.

6
00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:36.972
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I think I told you
before the first thing I was do with these

7
00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:38.140
is box sizing border box.

8
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.981
It just makes my life so much easier.

9
00:00:45.058 --> 00:00:47.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
let's start with some body styling here.

10
00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:53.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One of the fun things you
might remember from the other game is you

11
00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:58.140
have like a little bird mouse the entire
time that you're playing, right.

12
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.840
So the way that we're gonna
do that is to say I'm body.

13
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.063
The cursor is gonna be url(./cursor).

14
00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:08.332
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

15
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now if I save that and refresh.

16
00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:20.669
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Did I say
this was styles.css?

17
00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.446
And the other thing is you have
to give it a backup of some sort.

18
00:01:25.446 --> 00:01:28.699
So put, default.

19
00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:31.150
It gets upset if you don't
give us some sort of backup.

20
00:01:36.982 --> 00:01:40.138
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what this is saying
is like, load this cursor.png and

21
00:01:40.138 --> 00:01:43.720
make that you're like mouse
when you're on the page.

22
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.480
And if not, then use whatever
the browser tells you to use.

23
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.150
So now if I come over here and
click on it,

24
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.480
you can see that I have
the little bird floating around.

25
00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:58.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, background color.

26
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.790
We're gonna give it some sort of
background color so that it looks nicer.

27
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.240
So we're gonna give it
a nice shade of green.

28
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.233
Which I have here, c0c68d.

29
00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.077
So now if you refresh there,

30
00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:16.290
you can see that it's got
a nice green background for

31
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.759
the, looks like grass,
that they're coming out of.

32
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go ahead and
start on the background next.

33
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.750
So we're gonna say bg right here.

34
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.890
So the background image here is gonna
be from one of the assets I gave you.

35
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.520
So that's gonna be ./background.png.

36
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.095
Now for refresh here you can see it's

37
00:02:48.095 --> 00:02:53.093
got like a nice kind of background
from the artist, from the designer.

38
00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:56.785
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What did get
the background class to in the HTML?

39
00:02:56.785 --> 00:03:01.044
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We come back here,

40
00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:09.300
its the first thing inside the body.

41
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.968
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

42
00:03:10.968 --> 00:03:12.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
one of the things here.

43
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.680
If I come and stretch this out a bit,
notice that it's repeating the background,

44
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.380
which is not necessarily what we want,
right?

45
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.960
We want it to be, just one background.

46
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:32.230
So the way we're gonna do that is we're
gonna say background.repeat: no repeat.

47
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.620
So now if we refresh it,
we can see that it stops repeating.

48
00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:43.537
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

49
00:03:48.044 --> 00:03:51.263
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This game gets a lot easier
if we offer it on a fixed width and

50
00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:52.200
a fixed height.

51
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.660
So, a good way to do that is just to make
this background the same size as what

52
00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.510
the image is, which I already
know to be 1920 pixels by 1080.

53
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.410
Height 1080 pixels.

54
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.560
So now it's fixed width.

55
00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:17.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see there,
it'll make me scroll from side to side.

56
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.250
Just so you know,
1920 by 1080 is quite large so

57
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.320
you're assuming that your user is going
to have a quite large browser to work on.

58
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.000
This and
this would be horrendous on a phone.

59
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.920
But I think for the sake of this game,

60
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.810
where we're kind of assuming
the persons on desktop.

61
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.600
I think it's an okay assumption
to make in this particular case.

62
00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:39.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For the sake of ease.

63
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:44.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So.

64
00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.923
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, I think what I wanna
do is I want to get all of these moles

65
00:04:52.923 --> 00:04:55.240
kind of into a nice little row.

66
00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:03.007
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here,
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make this

67
00:05:03.007 --> 00:05:06.590
background display flex to use flex box.

68
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.268
I'm gonna say flex wrap.

69
00:05:12.268 --> 00:05:13.820
So what flex-wrap does is,

70
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.130
typically flex box assumes that you
want to just shove everything in a line.

71
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.250
You're basically giving it permissions,
like,

72
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.259
if you run out of space,
go to the next line.

73
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.714
So this is already gonna
look a little bit better.

74
00:05:27.752 --> 00:05:31.723
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see here
now everyone's at least fitting on

75
00:05:31.723 --> 00:05:34.318
a playing field, which is good.

76
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:42.432
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
we wanna say justify content.

77
00:05:42.432 --> 00:05:46.375
Center, align-items, center to get

78
00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:51.400
everything kind of more
centralized on the page.

79
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, you can see there
now there, now there's centralized.

80
00:05:57.908 --> 00:05:59.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Already
looking a lot better.

81
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.527
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I'm gonna just zoom out a little bit so

82
00:06:04.527 --> 00:06:06.770
we can kind of see the whole
playing field at once.

83
00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.449
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good so far with CSS?

84
00:06:17.677 --> 00:06:21.255
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if I have this big
page, like in someone's life zoomed out

85
00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:25.562
like I did, it would be better if this
was like a little bit more centralized on

86
00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:29.500
the page so we can do that here by
using display flex on the body as well.

87
00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.788
Display flex and

88
00:06:31.788 --> 00:06:36.577
then just the same justified
content center a line items center.

89
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.424
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and that gets us
a little bit more centered on the page.

90
00:06:47.562 --> 00:06:52.557
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When I say body
have padding : 0 and margin : 0.

91
00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:54.895
So that'll get rid of the little
tiny space that might be hard for

92
00:06:54.895 --> 00:06:56.945
you to see but there is a little
bit of space right there.

93
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.666
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now its actually
pushing all the way to the sides.
