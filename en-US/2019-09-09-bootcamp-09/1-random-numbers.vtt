00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.902
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's
one called math.random,

2
00:00:01.902 --> 00:00:04.720
that just returns to a random
number between zero and one.

3
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.760
So if I call it a bunch of times,
it's gonna be a bunch of things like that.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.087
But what happens if I wanna make it so

5
00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:15.900
something has a 50/50 chance of appearing,
right?

6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.100
The way I could do that is
math.random is greater than .5 right?

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.100
And then I'm gonna get sometimes true,
sometimes false, right?

8
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.990
Or if I wanna make it only a 10% chance,
then it would be greater than .9.

9
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.720
So most of time this is gonna be false.

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.090
But eventually,
one in 10 times it's gonna be true, right?

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.492
So you can do things like
that to get random numbers.

12
00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:45.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you have 10 holes out there, right?

13
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.090
And each one needs to have some
sort of random schedule to it.

14
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.840
So for me, I have them wait at least two
seconds before showing up again, right?

15
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.420
Cause they go back into their hole you
don't want to immediately show back up,

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.530
that doesn't make any sense.

17
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.890
But you don't want them to wait forever,

18
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.555
so I have them wait about
a max of 20 seconds.

19
00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:09.443
And again the way to do that, that I find
useful, so you have math dot random.

20
00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:15.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?
What if I want to turn that into a number

21
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.370
randomly between two and 20?

22
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.090
So I can do math.round or math.floor.

23
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.510
Let's just do math.floor since I think
it's a little easier to work with.

24
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.140
That always rounds down.

25
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.889
Okay?

26
00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:34.977
Then I'm gonna do math.random times 20,
and

27
00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:42.104
that's gonna give me a random
number between zero and 20.

28
00:01:42.104 --> 00:01:44.900
Let's say, you can see this one
was zero right there, right?

29
00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.740
So if I just add two,
after it's done it's random thing,

30
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.150
then it's gonna always be at least two.

31
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.230
So I guess that's between two and 22.

32
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.740
If you want it to be two and
20, you would do 18, right?

33
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.920
So there you go.

34
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.240
That math.floor,
math.random 18 times plus 2.

35
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.320
Does that make sense why that's
a random number between two and 20?

36
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.140
Let's maybe make this
a little bit more succinct.

37
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.286
So if i say X, a random number

38
00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:25.610
equals math.random.

39
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:34.092
Okay, so now X is gonna be
assigned that .five, right?

40
00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:36.880
And then we'll do X times 18.

41
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.982
Or random number, sorry random number.

42
00:02:41.982 --> 00:02:44.950
Random number times 18.

43
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.430
This is gonna give me a number that
has a really long decimal point,

44
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.760
and I don't care about the decimals,
I just care about the whole numbers.

45
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.748
So that's when I'm gonna come in and
say math.floor

46
00:02:58.748 --> 00:03:05.340
randomnumber times 18, and
that's when I'm gonna get nine.

47
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.018
Is that a little bit more,
make a bit more sense?

48
00:03:09.018 --> 00:03:14.410
Basically what math.random is gonna
give you is a percentage, right?

49
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.390
So give me a random percentage of 18.

50
00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.750
Because that's how percentages
work like it's 0.021, right?

51
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.135
And so if I ask for
50% of 18 then I'm gonna get 19, or 75%,

52
00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:28.015
or something like that.
