00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
the first thing we're gonna do here is

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:05.540
up here we were setting hungry.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.774
Now we have to remove hungry, because
they're no longer hungry, they're sad.

4
00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:15.130
So moles.status = sad.

5
00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.442
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, then they're sad.

6
00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.537
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next,
we'll put that up here,

7
00:00:32.537 --> 00:00:37.380
mole.next = getSadInterval, right?

8
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.310
Which we already wrote.

9
00:00:42.365 --> 00:00:44.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we just gotta change the source now.

10
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.206
So the source is going to be mole-sad.png

11
00:00:56.422 --> 00:01:02.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then another break.

12
00:01:12.772 --> 00:01:13.869
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions?

13
00:01:15.778 --> 00:01:19.158
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it important to change
the status first and then next, or

14
00:01:19.158 --> 00:01:20.720
put those in either order?

15
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, doesn't matter.

16
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.171
As long as it all gets done.

17
00:01:27.064 --> 00:01:32.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Didn't we have to have
a remove from the case leaving?

18
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here, when you add gone,
it's a display none, right.

19
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.224
So it doesn't really matter what it was.

20
00:01:50.784 --> 00:01:51.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

21
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, I think I'm one step
off in my head, but I'll figure it out.

22
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's
a lot to keep track of.

23
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.680
So one of the hardest
parts of like debugging in

24
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.950
program is thinking about
things over time, right?

25
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.050
Because you kind of have to keep this
amount of information at your head and

26
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.750
then you have to modify it over time and
go backwards and forwards.

27
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.866
And so games in this particular sense of
really tough because time is a really

28
00:02:15.866 --> 00:02:17.615
tough element to keep track of.

29
00:02:20.877 --> 00:02:23.330
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's why it's
good to have functions like this.

30
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.720
That this function in and
of itself is synchronous, right?

31
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.500
Everything happens without the element
of time introduced, right?

32
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.310
All you're doing is just if this,
then this, if this, then this, if this,

33
00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.879
then this.

34
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.286
So if you, here we try and

35
00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:44.484
keep all the time sensitive
stuff limited into next frame.
