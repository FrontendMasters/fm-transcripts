00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.517
Random the corner here,
let's go to app.js.

2
00:00:04.574 --> 00:00:05.650
We're actually going to go integrate.

3
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.757
We've finished all of our
Redux implementation.

4
00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:11.264
Now we're going to connect Redux to react.

5
00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:12.982
So delete theme context.

6
00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:15.817
We're going to use context anymore.

7
00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:21.783
And delete use state because we're
not gonna do any hooks anymore.

8
00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:25.756
We're going to import

9
00:00:25.756 --> 00:00:30.773
provider from react Redux,

10
00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:34.954
and then we're going to

11
00:00:34.954 --> 00:00:40.190
import the store from store.

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.187
Okay, delete this use state here.

13
00:00:43.187 --> 00:00:47.606
And we're going to replace
this theme context.provider

14
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.967
With store equals store.

15
00:00:56.552 --> 00:00:59.107
Okay, and then notice I changed
it down here as well on line 22.

16
00:00:59.107 --> 00:01:04.523
So it's provider.

17
00:01:04.523 --> 00:01:08.793
So this works exactly like context as that
now this store is available to everything

18
00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:10.078
underneath it, right?

19
00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:12.954
So, if I had some h1 here.

20
00:01:12.954 --> 00:01:17.478
And I was trying to read from the provider
here it would not be able to,

21
00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:20.370
cuz it's not inside of the component here.

22
00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:31.475
Okay, so now this is available
everywhere like context.

23
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:34.846
Let's head over to SearchParams.js.

24
00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:44.585
Okay, delete theme context, done.

25
00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:47.022
Delete use state we're not
going to use that anymore.

26
00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:51.240
You can delete use context as well.

27
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.192
Actually, I think we do need still
we still do need use state but

28
00:01:55.192 --> 00:01:57.514
we don't need use context anymore.

29
00:01:57.514 --> 00:02:00.382
Okay, you can delete the theme here.

30
00:02:00.382 --> 00:02:05.578
You can delete animal, you can delete
breed, you can do delete location.

31
00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:11.481
Okay, we're gonna still store pets here,
but

32
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:14.242
you totally could move
that to Redux as well.

33
00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:23.239
Okay, and then up here we're
going to import a new function

34
00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.885
called use selector which
is a hook from react Redux.

35
00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:32.853
So now const animal is going
to be equal to use selector,

36
00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:37.519
and then you write a function that says,
all right?

37
00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.424
So this is the overall state
of my entire Redux store and

38
00:02:42.424 --> 00:02:48.838
then you're going to just return
the part that this thing cares about.

39
00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:54.779
So in this case, all I care about
in my Redux store is state.animal.

40
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:02.989
Right, now animal is just going
to be pulled out of Redux, and

41
00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.134
so on and so forth location.

42
00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:12.520
Use selector, state return,
state.location.

43
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.076
Const breed = useSelector.

44
00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:25.973
And I'll show you if you wanna write
this a little bit different way,

45
00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:30.746
which is breed,
this is destructuring breed out of this.

46
00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:35.704
These two things are doing relatively
the same ones just using destructuring.

47
00:03:35.704 --> 00:03:37.859
Honestly, this is probably a bit clearer.

48
00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.391
It's a bit less dense in terms
of all the parentheses and

49
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:47.131
curly brace it up to your
discretion which one you prefer.

50
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:51.194
Const theme=useSelector.

51
00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:54.670
State return, state.theme.

52
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.559
Now the first thing that people always
ask me here is like why don't I just

53
00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.253
return all of the state.

54
00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:06.203
And then just instead of yet right just
say current state equals use selector

55
00:04:06.203 --> 00:04:11.074
state state, and then I just say
instead of state.theme right down here,

56
00:04:11.074 --> 00:04:14.495
I'll just say state.animal and
so on and so forth.

57
00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:18.691
Let me tell you why this is a bad idea.

58
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.987
So one this is useful for
you getting animal out of this.

59
00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:22.604
So now you just have animal here.

60
00:04:22.604 --> 00:04:27.019
But Redux is also going to use
this as the subscription function.

61
00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:31.895
So If you do this, it's gonna say,
whenever state changes ever

62
00:04:31.895 --> 00:04:35.976
across my entire application
update search params.

63
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.182
That is not what you want, right?

64
00:04:38.182 --> 00:04:41.496
What you want is like if
animal specifically changes,

65
00:04:41.496 --> 00:04:43.738
then update search params, right?

66
00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:48.064
So these serve both to get
the information out of Redux.

67
00:04:48.064 --> 00:04:55.150
And it also serves as a subscription to
let react know when do I update this?

68
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.740
That makes sense.

69
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.072
So don't do this line
14 is an anti-pattern.

70
00:05:02.072 --> 00:05:06.821
Okay.

71
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:10.753
That should be it, at least for this.
