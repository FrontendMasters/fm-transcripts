00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.920
So let's talk about like what tailwind is,
what it's gonna do for us.

2
00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.132
And whether you might like it or not.

3
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:11.414
First of all, it's normal that this is
yellow underlined It's gonna say I don't

4
00:00:11.414 --> 00:00:12.790
understand what this is.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.190
I'm just gonna leave it
because I don't care.

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.238
But if this bothers you,
you can change that in VS

7
00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:26.411
code by ignoring CSS .lint
unknown add rolls, so

8
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:31.708
you'd go to preferences
open settings Jason, and

9
00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:36.759
then you'd add a line
here that basically says,

10
00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:39.867
CSS lint .unknown add roll.

11
00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:44.890
And then here you'd say, Ignore.

12
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.552
And so if I save that, and this is gonna
be cool, I don't care anymore, right?

13
00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.931
You can probably do that
like a project level,

14
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:57.347
because you don't always wanna
ignore that, but suffice to say,

15
00:00:57.347 --> 00:01:00.352
I'm just gonna leave it off
because I don't really care.

16
00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:04.571
Because we're not gonna look
at this style file anymore.

17
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:08.393
Okay, so that's everything
that we need from tailwind,

18
00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:11.051
let's talk about the what tailwind is.

19
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:14.548
With tailwind you write zero CSS.

20
00:01:14.548 --> 00:01:18.750
No more style dot CSS you're not gonna
write any of your CSS rules in there.

21
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.530
Instead, you're gonna use very
small utility classes, or

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.800
like atomic CSS as some
people have been calling it.

23
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.280
And you're gonna use that
to style your app, so

24
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.370
basically all of your CSS stuff is gonna
live inside of your components as classes.

25
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.370
This offends some people.

26
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.042
Some of the class names will get
quite long cuz as you might imagine,

27
00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:46.424
sometimes we apply a lot of thing, but it
also allows you to go really fast because

28
00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:50.110
you don't have to context switch
like ever, which is pretty cool.

29
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:53.650
It's popular.

30
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.300
I'll say that.

31
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.950
I don't always use it.

32
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.910
I sometimes use it.

33
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.009
I've been writing CSS for so
long that I can write CSS quite quickly so

34
00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.220
in general I kinda default to that.

35
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.568
My favorite thing is CSS modules still,
like very small CSS files that are just

36
00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:11.660
important to all of your
different components.

37
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.220
That's generally my like default go to,
but tailwind is pretty cool and

38
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.572
I've watched some of my friends just
crank out stuff incredibly fast and

39
00:02:21.572 --> 00:02:23.520
add pieces that I cannot match.

40
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.670
So It's compelling.

41
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.360
And so I want you to go through it.

42
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.001
I like showing these controversial things
to challenge what you think about how to

43
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:31.590
write code.

44
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.400
I think in general that's just healthy.

45
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.135
Even if you don't end up choosing
tailwind as your go-to thing,

46
00:02:37.135 --> 00:02:40.380
you're gonna learn something and
it's gonna make you better writing code.

47
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.660
Or it's gonna make you angry and
you gonna go tweet about.

48
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.132
I don't know either way I'm entertained.

49
00:02:49.132 --> 00:02:57.182
So, there is a cool VS code
extension called tailwind,

50
00:02:57.182 --> 00:03:03.640
CSS, IntelliSense, yeah, this one.

51
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.810
Pretty cool.

52
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.961
Let's go ahead and drop that in there.

53
00:03:11.222 --> 00:03:14.455
And this is pulled out directly
from Tailwind Labs which

54
00:03:14.455 --> 00:03:16.390
is the company behind Tailwind.

55
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.397
So yeah, Tailwind is free to use but

56
00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:23.090
they have a bunch of stuff on
top of it that you can use.

57
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.690
There's additional tooling.

58
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.290
They have like pre made components that
you can use pre made theming stuff.

59
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.000
So worthwhile, right?

60
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.310
If you can pay someone else to maintain
your code for you I say go for it.

61
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.780
So just supporting open source.

62
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.418
So, okay.

63
00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:43.410
Let's go back to our directory here.

64
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.765
And we're gonna make a new file here,
and we're gonna call it to post, CSSRC.

65
00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:58.960
Make sure that you put that dot there,
.post CSSRC.

66
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.920
Again this is like the babble of CSS.

67
00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.240
Okay, and
here we're gonna give it two plugins.

68
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.949
This used to be so
much harder to set up by the way, so

69
00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.640
just feel lucky that this is have
a fairly minimal set of configurations.

70
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.570
You just have to tell what
we're gonna include here.

71
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.275
So one is gonna be auto prefixer, and

72
00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:25.467
we're gonna give it no
additional configurations, and

73
00:04:25.467 --> 00:04:30.117
then again tailwind CSS,
with no additional configuration.

74
00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:35.845
This is just so that post CSS is like
hey post CSS watch out for this.

75
00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:38.085
This works the same way of
like our Babel config up here,

76
00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:40.050
where we're just adding
the parts that we need.

77
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.550
Need.

78
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.816
It is bothers you that is not highlighted
you can say change language mode,

79
00:04:49.816 --> 00:04:54.220
and just put this in or you put in auto
detect it'll probably get JSON, right?

80
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.809
Nope, change language mode it's in JSON,
there you go.

81
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:04.746
All right.

82
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.254
So now that we've deleted all of our CSS,
if you go run your application,

83
00:05:12.254 --> 00:05:16.528
it's gonna look, let's go with
slightly worse than it did before.

84
00:05:16.528 --> 00:05:20.883
So local host, 2,3,4,
probably unsurprising to you but

85
00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:23.760
this is what our application looks like,

86
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.870
with no additional styling right this
is just the HTML in the JavaScript.

87
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.467
So tailwind like most of these kinda CSS

88
00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:36.940
frameworks gives you nothing for
free, right?

89
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.050
It still expects you to
style your application.

90
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.720
It's just a way of
styling your application.

91
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.900
Or in other words, this is a Bootstrap or
a bunch of stuff that's just free, right?

92
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.960
Or like it's not a style system.

93
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.720
It's not a design system.

94
00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.370
It's a tool for building applications.

95
00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:57.871
As opposed to something like Bootstrap,

96
00:05:57.871 --> 00:06:00.768
which is right Bootstrap is designed
to be like your design system.

97
00:06:00.768 --> 00:06:01.325
Okay.

98
00:06:01.325 --> 00:06:07.207
So, I'm gonna need you to
suspend everything you think

99
00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:12.350
you know about CSS for
like 30 to 40 minutes.

100
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.060
And we're good with that.

101
00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.158
For me it's not hard because I don't
know that much about it [LAUGH] But

102
00:06:21.158 --> 00:06:26.018
just like just take an open mind,
that's all I'm asking you here at

103
00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:29.900
the end of this,
then evaluate how you feel about it.

104
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.440
So we have all of our old
class names in there.

105
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.291
You can delete them or

106
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:38.520
leave them because we're doing no more
styling on it doesn't really matter.

107
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.250
I'm just gonna leave them for
the most part.

108
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.506
But let's start in app.js.

109
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:49.374
Okay.

110
00:06:49.374 --> 00:06:54.210
And then the div right inside of,
Same theme context provider

111
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.130
There's no div in here.

112
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.790
That's fine.

113
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.340
We can make one.

114
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.875
So we're gonna wrap the browser
router inside of a div.

115
00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.708
And we're gonna say, class name,

116
00:07:18.708 --> 00:07:22.277
equals p- 0 and m- 0.

117
00:07:22.277 --> 00:07:30.110
And so you'll see all these
class names coming in.

118
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.919
This is coming from that IntelliSense.

119
00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.537
Extension that we just installed, so if
you don't install it you won't have that,

120
00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:39.620
in general I kinda leave it off because
I don't always use tailwind right?

121
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.318
But it's useful when you
have a talent project.

122
00:07:42.318 --> 00:07:44.960
So p- 0, what does that mean?

123
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.140
There you go it means padding 0.

124
00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:53.770
So I'm seeing that this div here has no
padding and no, as you might guess margin.

125
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.270
Right?

126
00:07:57.682 --> 00:08:00.324
Okay, so
probably can't see anything here but

127
00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:04.361
you can see now there's nothing
between it and the side, that's cool.

128
00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:08.041
Now we wanna have a background right
because we had that nice looking

129
00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:11.310
background that was drawn
by the artist before.

130
00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:13.070
Obviously there's no pre made class for
that.

131
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.870
So we're just going to put
the style in directly.

132
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.202
I'm gonna say background,

133
00:08:20.202 --> 00:08:25.533
Image not background URL and

134
00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:32.864
then you can do HTTP ://pet- images

135
00:08:32.864 --> 00:08:40.641
dev- API's.com/pets/ wallpaper,

136
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:47.100
not a capital wallpaper a dot jpg.

137
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.089
Let me just make sure that
is correct before I have

138
00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:57.333
you finish copying all that
doesn't look like it is

139
00:09:05.654 --> 00:09:15.310
Is it Yeah, that doesn't like a threat.

140
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:19.840
All right, http://pets-images Pets images.

141
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.020
There we go, okay.

142
00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:26.600
So, that's why I checked.

143
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.420
I think there are actually a,
b and c in here as well.

144
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.950
If you're interested in customizing it,
so that one's grayscale.

145
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:37.290
And then see, I think yes,
just like a different palette.

146
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:39.610
So stick with the one you want.

147
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:47.068
I'm gonna stick with a So, again,
I'm sure someone is rolling their eyes,

148
00:09:47.068 --> 00:09:50.950
is like are we doing style tags directly
again, didn't we get away from this?

149
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:53.141
We did not, we're coming back,
time is a flat circle.

150
00:09:56.585 --> 00:10:00.251
Okay, so that is the first one,
P0 and Pm0,

151
00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:04.012
that's obviously margin, 0 and padding 0.

152
00:10:04.012 --> 00:10:10.185
As you might imagine if you want
a little bit of padding, guess what?

153
00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:11.345
There you go.

154
00:10:11.345 --> 00:10:14.191
P1.
If you want a lot of padding,

155
00:10:14.191 --> 00:10:17.094
that's 2.5 rems, right?

156
00:10:17.094 --> 00:10:20.560
RAM stands for root M's right?

157
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:27.610
And M is how let's see why
it an M is in your font.

158
00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.940
And are just stands at the root right?

159
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.793
As opposed to an M which is relative to
whatever the font size is where you are,

160
00:10:33.793 --> 00:10:37.013
so rents are the same across
multiple divs AMS can be different.

161
00:10:41.484 --> 00:10:44.129
By the same token, there are X's e x,

162
00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:49.370
which is how tall an x is in your font,
or I think Rex is our thing too right?

163
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.240
Am I not making that up?

164
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.612
Let check.

165
00:10:55.612 --> 00:11:00.130
Let's see, inspect.

166
00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:04.580
We'll say that the, I don't want layout,

167
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:09.157
I want changes, nope not changes, layout.

168
00:11:14.447 --> 00:11:15.130
Here.

169
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:15.818
No, I want this.

170
00:11:15.818 --> 00:11:23.100
Height, 10x,
you can see that'll be fairly small.

171
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.910
But I think you can also make it 10 REX.

172
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:27.910
Nope, don't make that up.

173
00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.390
Okay, so I guess Rex is not a thing.

174
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.360
But rooms are.

175
00:11:33.952 --> 00:11:37.090
In this case, AMS and rams,
end up being the same thing.

176
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.550
Because we haven't modified it.

177
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:46.270
But I think here, if I say 10 or
font size 30 pixels,

178
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:50.730
which should be fairly large, right?

179
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.620
And then it ends up being different.

180
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.465
I don't know why we decided to
get into this right now, but

181
00:11:58.465 --> 00:12:00.910
it felt important to tell you that.

182
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:03.410
Told you this was not a CSS course.

183
00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.220
Anyway, here we are.

184
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.720
Let's go.

185
00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:12.630
So, four M's and
PS there's one through 12.

186
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.860
So you can do P0 through P12 and
then at that point,

187
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.526
it's more of like a random
integer increase,

188
00:12:20.526 --> 00:12:25.430
so there's no for
example there's no 13 but there is 14.

189
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.482
So there's 12, 14, 16, 20,
24, 28 32, 36 and 40 and

190
00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:30.160
then it kinda just spaces out from there.

191
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.300
The largest is 96.

192
00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:40.716
There's also a negative, so
like you can also do -m1

193
00:12:40.716 --> 00:12:47.330
if you need negative margins, but
so all that is available to you.

194
00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:51.018
So this kinda lets you just like mess with
spacing directly by changing classes,

195
00:12:51.018 --> 00:12:53.800
which may or may not appeal to you,
but that's how you do it.

196
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.677
So In general you don't have to do too
many style tags like this, but for

197
00:13:00.677 --> 00:13:03.340
things like where it's an image
we have to give it a URL.

198
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.540
Obviously they're not going to give you
a utility class for your specific URL.

199
00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.625
It's pretty rare that you have to
go in and throw in a style tag and

200
00:13:10.625 --> 00:13:13.820
it's mostly just for
specifically for images or content.

201
00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:14.320
Right?

202
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:16.620
That's about it.

203
00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.120
Okay.

204
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.070
Good so far any questions?

205
00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.250
All right.

206
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:29.870
Let's do our header.

207
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:37.979
Class name equals and In this one
we're gonna do all sorta fun stuff.

208
00:13:37.979 --> 00:13:44.915
With full Margin bottom10,

209
00:13:44.915 --> 00:13:50.119
text center, padding let's do

210
00:13:50.119 --> 00:13:55.330
a nice 7, background gradient

211
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:05.467
And then we wanna go from you can
go from left to right to left,

212
00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:11.760
top to bottom we're gonna go from top,
the say to bottom like that.

213
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.650
So background gradient to bottom.

214
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.930
Okay.

215
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:22.930
And then we want our grading to go from,
like a nice purple

216
00:14:27.174 --> 00:14:31.170
And it's like maybe,
like a medium purple, right?

217
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.080
That's like a 400 It goes from
like zero to 1000 I think.

218
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.770
Okay.
So a nice medium purple.

219
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:40.120
Let's go via a pink.

220
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.460
A medium pink.

221
00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:43.996
Yeah, medium pink.

222
00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:50.480
And then we wanna go and
end up in like a red.

223
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.870
So 2 red Again, nice medium red
here you can see all the various

224
00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:00.460
different colors here will
go with a nice medium red.

225
00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.610
And you get the nice little
color squares to, again,

226
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.910
that's all coming from the tailwind and
tell us sense.

227
00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:12.850
Okay, with our link,
we have to get this some class names too.

228
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:18.100
So class name equals, let's make it like
a text and we want it to be pretty big.

229
00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.430
So let's do like a six XL.

230
00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:21.570
So that's real big, right?

231
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.093
Let's do like text white, It's nice.

232
00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:35.281
And then whenever we hover,
when you hover a colon, text-gray-200.

233
00:15:41.845 --> 00:15:43.633
All right.
I intentionally made these bananas so

234
00:15:43.633 --> 00:15:46.902
that you can see the kinda the stuff
that you can do with talent, right.

235
00:15:46.902 --> 00:15:49.041
Typically we would have gone back and

236
00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:53.802
forth between our CSS document right I
cannot write gradients from memory I don't

237
00:15:53.802 --> 00:15:57.887
know if you can if you can I apologize
apparently someone has hurt you.

238
00:15:57.887 --> 00:15:59.957
But I can do this from memory right.

239
00:15:59.957 --> 00:16:02.940
This is actually pretty
easy to do from memory.

240
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.240
So background gradients I'm gonna go
from top to bottom, then from via and

241
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:10.050
to that's kinda English
that makes sense to me.

242
00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.388
And now I think if we pop over here,

243
00:16:13.388 --> 00:16:18.090
we made this with just kinda handful of
utility classes and I did it for memory.

244
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.503
Now you might argue Brian that is hideous,
you are correct it is actually hideous,

245
00:16:21.503 --> 00:16:23.960
but it's pretty cool that we
were able to do it from memory.
