00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.560
Let's go do pet really quick.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.350
Because right now we have like this,
these pets, and

3
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.336
we're just kind of blindly
rendering out the text here.

4
00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:12.160
It'd be cool if we could make like
a little overlay here really quick, right?

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.680
So let's do that.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.898
So in pet.

7
00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:21.349
So first thing up here,
class name equals, and

8
00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:23.820
we're just going to
replace class name here.

9
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.810
I'm gonna put relative and
block, cell position relative.

10
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.781
So that means I can do absolute
positioning inside of here and

11
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:36.593
it will be relative to
the outward anchor tag.

12
00:00:36.593 --> 00:00:39.646
And the anchor tag will be a block, right?

13
00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:41.749
So that's what that does.

14
00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:44.630
Everything else here,
this can be all left the same.

15
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.963
You can delete this
className if you want to.

16
00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:50.940
It's not doing anything but
you can if you want to.

17
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.932
Then this className here instead of info,
we want absolute, position absolute.

18
00:00:56.932 --> 00:01:00.350
Botton-0, so,
we want it to be along the bottom.

19
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.440
We want it to be on the left side,
so left-0.

20
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:11.819
Let me want a background gradient
To top right so 2-TR, 2-TR.

21
00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:16.098
So that's gonna go from
bottom left to top right and

22
00:01:16.098 --> 00:01:21.580
we're gonna go from white to I
think it's transparent, right?

23
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:29.021
Yep, to transparent which means that
it goes to an opacity zero, right?

24
00:01:29.021 --> 00:01:33.230
And then when do padding right 2 and
padding top 2,

25
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.055
sorry, just to give us
some extra space there so

26
00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:41.854
that the gradient can kind of fade off and
look kind of nice.

27
00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:53.047
Okay, and then now you get these kind
of nice little tags that are kind of

28
00:01:53.047 --> 00:01:55.048
floating over the bottom here.

29
00:01:58.773 --> 00:02:05.705
Not the nicest thing you've ever designed,
but I also did it in 45 seconds.

30
00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:08.818
I guess that's kinda why I like tailwind
is it kind of matches the way that I do

31
00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:11.120
prototyping but
I end up with something that I can keep.

32
00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:14.544
Just kinda nice.

33
00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:16.402
Normally I'm just doing
this in the browser and

34
00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.639
then I'm copying my styles
over my style sheet, right?

35
00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.055
Okay, that is tailwind.css.

36
00:02:23.698 --> 00:02:28.153
So going back over to our course
website here, we just finished

37
00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.540
Tailwind down here with positioning.

38
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.180
So again, I'm gonna let you know
we did not fix this page, right?

39
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.032
This is still a hot mess but
I think it would be a cool exercise for

40
00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:52.400
you to go back afterwards and try and
make that look nice yourself, Awesome.

41
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.205
So now if you click here you should be
able to go here this is the state of

42
00:02:57.205 --> 00:02:58.735
the world with tailwind.css.
