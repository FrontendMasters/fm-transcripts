00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.412
That is the end of intermediate React.

2
00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:05.934
Congratulations for sticking through it,
this is a lot of information all at once.

3
00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:09.330
So if you feel a little overwhelmed,
it's because it's overwhelming.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.091
But I feel pretty confident, if you've
taken this and the Complete Intro to

5
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:16.460
React, you're pretty well prepared
to take on any React project.

6
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:20.846
Yeah, thanks for sticking with me.

7
00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:24.672
Please tweet me your satisfaction or
dissatisfaction.

8
00:00:24.672 --> 00:00:27.344
If it's dissatisfaction,
then please tweet it at Steve Kinney.

9
00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:30.316
If it's satisfaction,
please tweet it at me.

10
00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:32.733
As always, I'd love a star on this repo.

11
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:37.386
And thanks again, I'll see you all back
in Frontend Masters soon, and yeah.

12
00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:41.670
&gt;&gt; And they should check out the
Frontend Masters learning path on React.

13
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.187
&gt;&gt; Definitely, so there is
a Fronted Masters learning path for React.

14
00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:51.189
And there's several more courses in
the series that you can definitely take,

15
00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:54.389
I could probably just show
it to you really quick.

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.497
There is one down here for React.

17
00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.877
So there's other things in here.

18
00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:09.056
Obviously, Steve's really good
here with state management.

19
00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:11.607
More TypeScript,
Redux fundamentals, Gatsby,

20
00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:14.107
if that's something that interests you,
Next.

21
00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:19.421
There's a lot of directions to go here
that you can definitely check out.

22
00:01:19.421 --> 00:01:23.456
React Native is also super interesting,
design systems.

23
00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.748
It all depends on what
your next steps are,

24
00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:28.239
you get more specialized
as you go down there.

25
00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:30.166
So there's some really cool stuff.

26
00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.938
In Frontend Masters,
there's always really some cool stuff.

27
00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:34.459
All right, thank you.
