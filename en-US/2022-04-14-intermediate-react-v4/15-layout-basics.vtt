00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.153
We're gonna pop into
search params such as,

2
00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:12.333
One thing is we're not going to do details
like this is an exercise I leave to

3
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:16.604
you to do after the course is to
go try and do details by yourself.

4
00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:24.373
Hop into search params
above the form here.

5
00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:27.492
So here's his search params
you can just delete that.

6
00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:36.023
We're going to do margin
wise zero MX auto and

7
00:00:36.023 --> 00:00:41.194
then with 11 out of 12.

8
00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:49.117
This IntelliSense is magical it's
great for teaching so what is my?

9
00:00:49.117 --> 00:00:53.821
Top and bottom right and, so instead of
saying nt zero mb zero you can just say my

10
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:55.832
which means up and down, right?

11
00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:57.491
Top and bottom.

12
00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:01.006
Then as you might guess,
mx left and right and

13
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:04.254
then auto is just like center it, right?

14
00:01:04.254 --> 00:01:08.970
No margin top and bottom but
center on the x-axis automatically.

15
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.986
Then w 11 out of 12 is I
want this to take up 91% of

16
00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:19.344
the page There are 11 twelfths
of its available space.

17
00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:23.511
As you can imagine,
you can put three out of 12 here or

18
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:26.510
something like that it'll do 25%.

19
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.291
In our case,
we wanted to take up most of the page but

20
00:01:29.291 --> 00:01:32.222
we want like a nice little
looking gutter on the side.

21
00:01:35.242 --> 00:01:40.540
Okay, and then here on the form,
we're going to add some stuff here.

22
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:48.150
We're just going to say
padding 10 margin bottom 10.

23
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.502
Rounded, because we want
like nice rounded corners.

24
00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:57.237
This is not, you know, web point 1.0
We're definitely strongly web 2.0.

25
00:01:57.237 --> 00:02:03.492
We're going to do large Select nice
looking rounding roundedness background.

26
00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:10.031
We'll do a gray 200 nice light gray shadow
definitely large we all like shadows.

27
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.640
Flex so you can do display flex this way.

28
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.874
Then we're gonna do flex we're
gonna go into column direction and

29
00:02:18.874 --> 00:02:25.759
we're gonna do a justify center Then
we're going to do items center.

30
00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.539
It's like it's gonna be flex in
the direction of north south,

31
00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:33.980
right and then everything's going to
be centered along the center axis.

32
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.724
So item center.

33
00:02:38.724 --> 00:02:43.512
If you're not familiar with Flexbox and
flex.

34
00:02:43.512 --> 00:02:46.372
Jen teaches a class on flex.

35
00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:49.749
Yeah, and Jen is a whiz when she's
the best when it comes to CSS.

36
00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:53.768
Definitely take her class if
you're interested in more that.

37
00:02:53.768 --> 00:02:59.768
All right, so now if we go over here
to one of our details or search.

38
00:02:59.768 --> 00:03:05.020
Page, you can see here,
you got like a nice little shadow here,

39
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.639
we got like a nice looking
kind of form here.

40
00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.939
Obviously we still need to work
on the form controls themselves.

41
00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.378
But, so far so good that this looks a lot
better than it did right instead of just

42
00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:17.668
being off to the side.

43
00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.057
So notice we got rounded corners here.

44
00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:27.197
That's what the rounded out
large did shadow you can see

45
00:03:27.197 --> 00:03:34.193
there's a nice little shadow so looks
like it's off the page a little bit and

46
00:03:34.193 --> 00:03:38.346
then the flex made it go
north south with these

47
00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:43.075
controls here all right
any questions about that.

48
00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:44.766
&gt;&gt; Can you do grid.

49
00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:50.649
&gt;&gt; We're gonna do grid in a bit,
it's really cool Undeniably

50
00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:55.043
like whether not you like what we're doing
right now this is fast right it's really

51
00:03:55.043 --> 00:03:58.891
fast to knock this out, particularly
the more familiar you get with it.

52
00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:01.889
That is to me the biggest
value prop of Tollens.

53
00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.319
I've never been able to code so
fast with CSS.

54
00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.727
That's compelling.
