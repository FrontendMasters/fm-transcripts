WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.817
We are done with hooks we're done with
the sandbox code sandbox you can close

2
00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:07.539
code sandbox we're not coming back to it.

3
00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:12.602
And now we're actually going
to get into our project so

4
00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:15.692
you can leave page that's fine.

5
00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:20.745
As a reminder to go in here to tailwind
CSS, this is the next section here.

6
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.004
You are going to start with a fresh
copy of that 12 dash portals and refs.

7
00:00:34.593 --> 00:00:41.554
I have it here up, github/btholt complete
intro to react to the seven projects.

8
00:00:41.554 --> 00:00:45.637
If you haven't already I told you earlier
but if you haven't already cloned this and

9
00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:47.491
then just make a copy of this portals.

10
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:52.212
And refs folder this is
the complete project that you and

11
00:00:52.212 --> 00:00:54.320
I are going to start on for

12
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.252
tailwind I already did that you
can see here on my desktop.

13
00:00:59.252 --> 00:01:04.029
I have intermediate.

14
00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:07.454
I have that here I ran npm install but

15
00:01:07.454 --> 00:01:12.259
you can do it again if
you want to 433 packages.

16
00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.271
Zero vulnerabilities that I always get
surprised when I have no vulnerabilities,

17
00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:19.323
my code just seems like there's
the new one every day, right?

18
00:01:21.807 --> 00:01:24.362
They're like this is a weak or there's
definitely something already broken here

19
00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:26.593
&gt;&gt; Makes you think that bad things broken

20
00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:28.567
&gt;&gt; Yeah no there's definitely stuff

21
00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:33.124
here that we just don't know about yet
anyway by the time unless you download and

22
00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:34.022
install this.

23
00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:37.626
It probably is, you can also always say
MPM audit to figure out what they are.

24
00:01:37.626 --> 00:01:41.889
In general you don't have to care if
this is all development stuff but

25
00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.295
that's how you look.

26
00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:48.805
Okay, so
I think I have it opened here, I do,

27
00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:54.317
and you and I are going to,
I do tailwind CSS.

28
00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:57.606
This is meant to be like an intro to
it and how to make it work with react.

29
00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:02.163
This is not a complete course on tailwind
CSS because it has actually merits its own

30
00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:06.874
course there's a lot of stuff
you can do with tailwind So

31
00:02:06.874 --> 00:02:09.213
like I said, we're intentionally
scratching the surface.

32
00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:12.817
This is more intentionally
just to show you how to do it,

33
00:02:12.817 --> 00:02:17.724
where to do it, how to set it up and kinda
the general paradigm of what you want

34
00:02:17.724 --> 00:02:20.355
to be thinking about with tailwind CSS.

35
00:02:20.355 --> 00:02:22.719
All right, so stop your server for
just a second.

36
00:02:24.752 --> 00:02:26.412
I'm gonna say MPM.

37
00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:32.052
If you wanna be lazy like,
probably should want to be.

38
00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:35.870
Go here to this and just copy and
paste this whole string right there.

39
00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:40.075
I'm gonna type it out for
you so you can see.

40
00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:44.550
Tailwind CSS,
you can see I actually already

41
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.509
have it in there, at3.0.22 As a reminder.

42
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:53.314
I said this in probably before, but
I'm having to install particular versions

43
00:02:53.314 --> 00:02:55.924
of this there probably by
the time that you watch this,

44
00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:57.647
there are probably a new versions.

45
00:02:57.647 --> 00:02:59.944
There's probably already new versions for

46
00:02:59.944 --> 00:03:03.301
a lot of these things since I wrote
this like a couple of days ago.

47
00:03:03.301 --> 00:03:05.852
But I know all these
versions work together.

48
00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:10.275
And so I really get upset when like people
take this course and install the latest

49
00:03:10.275 --> 00:03:14.584
versions and stuff doesn't work together
because stuff changes over time.

50
00:03:14.584 --> 00:03:18.257
So all of these libraries that I'm
showing you, they might bugs and

51
00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:22.651
vulnerabilities and things like that,
that caused them to update the version.

52
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:25.248
But in general,
most of these are not changing.

53
00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:29.804
For a crazy amount between now and
when you would watch this, we update this

54
00:03:29.804 --> 00:03:34.449
course quickly enough that generally
we're pretty on top of those things.

55
00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:39.839
So that's why I'm having to
install possibly old versions.

56
00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:44.677
We're more interested in new learning,
and like learning the general

57
00:03:44.677 --> 00:03:49.366
high level concepts then like
the absolute particular syntax Okay.

58
00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:53.577
So at a point 4.6.

59
00:03:53.577 --> 00:03:58.963
And then auto pre fixer

60
00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:03.503
at 10.4.2.

61
00:04:03.503 --> 00:04:08.840
Okay Again, cat dash capital D.

62
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.507
This is MPM install dash dash save Dev.

63
00:04:12.507 --> 00:04:16.205
Or if you're lazy like me, I dash capital
D, which is going to put it in dev

64
00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:20.224
dependencies, because you don't actually
ship these things to production.

65
00:04:20.224 --> 00:04:24.477
These are tools that are used to build
the project that then get shipped

66
00:04:24.477 --> 00:04:25.498
to production.

67
00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:28.529
And, frankly,
it doesn't totally matter a whole lot.

68
00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.151
I Anyway, because the project is gonna
get built and deployed anyway, so

69
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:32.346
whether it's a dev dependency.

70
00:04:32.346 --> 00:04:34.314
Or dependency doesn't really matter, but

71
00:04:34.314 --> 00:04:36.772
that's the thought process
that I'm going through.

72
00:04:39.223 --> 00:04:45.188
Okay, so now we have our project.

73
00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:47.458
So let's talk about what we installed.

74
00:04:47.458 --> 00:04:49.770
Tailwind CSS at version three.

75
00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:50.890
I think that's pretty self explanatory.

76
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.857
That's the project that's
going to do tailwind for us.

77
00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:58.162
Post CSS is like Babel,
but for CSS, right?

78
00:04:58.162 --> 00:05:01.566
It's a code transformation tool
that takes one set of CSS and

79
00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:03.447
outputs a different part of CSS.

80
00:05:03.447 --> 00:05:06.489
You can use this for
anything that you want to do a CSS.

81
00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:10.786
You can have it, do stuff like non
standard syntaxes It would be something

82
00:05:10.786 --> 00:05:14.550
like Sass not Sass,
particularly cuz Sass is a different tool.

83
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.233
But you could do things like that.

84
00:05:17.233 --> 00:05:20.981
We can use it for
things like futuristic CSS, right?

85
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:26.532
So if I want to write like CSS variables,
for example, and I want to support IE 11.

86
00:05:26.532 --> 00:05:31.257
Post CSS allows us to do things like
that right because IE 11 wouldn't

87
00:05:31.257 --> 00:05:32.920
support CSS variables.

88
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.880
And then autoprefixer is
basically like preset for

89
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.634
babel where it takes new syntax and
translates it to old syntax.

90
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:42.671
It's called autoprefixer.

91
00:05:42.671 --> 00:05:48.019
Because if you remember, if you've
been writing code as long as I have,

92
00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:51.352
we used to have to do
things like dash Chrome or

93
00:05:51.352 --> 00:05:55.058
dash WebKit dash what's border radius,
right?

94
00:05:55.058 --> 00:05:58.165
Things like that,
that used to prefix all of your stuff so

95
00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:00.115
that it would work in all browsers.

96
00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:02.149
So, that's what we just installed.

97
00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:08.676
And now, we want to make a tailwind
CSS configuration document.

98
00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:14.154
So, the easiest way to do that

99
00:06:14.154 --> 00:06:18.984
is MPX Tailwind CSS in it.

100
00:06:18.984 --> 00:06:24.237
And this will create like a bare
bones starter configuration

101
00:06:24.237 --> 00:06:30.726
document here you see this just popped
up here tailwind dot config dot j s and

102
00:06:30.726 --> 00:06:35.883
we're going to modify this just
a little bit for our needs.

103
00:06:35.883 --> 00:06:40.937
So the first thing that
we're gonna do is mode.

104
00:06:40.937 --> 00:06:47.136
jit, jit stands for just in time,
in case you're wondering.

105
00:06:47.136 --> 00:06:52.287
This is the new mode of Tailwind CSS
that you get better performance out of.

106
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.652
We're gonna tell it content here, which
is like the stuff that we wanna build,

107
00:06:58.652 --> 00:07:01.010
which we wanna build just stuff in source.

108
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.948
And then we wanna build everything inside
of source with anything HTML or JS.

109
00:07:11.944 --> 00:07:14.589
Okay, theme extends is fine.

110
00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:20.191
We'll use variants in a bit, but for
now you can just have an empty variants.

111
00:07:20.191 --> 00:07:21.164
And that's it.

112
00:07:24.359 --> 00:07:25.735
Okay, good so far.

113
00:07:30.167 --> 00:07:35.411
Now, I want you to go to your
style dot CSS document here,

114
00:07:35.411 --> 00:07:41.657
my beautiful, beautiful CSS that
you should probably never copy.

115
00:07:41.657 --> 00:07:45.137
And I want you to do the most
satisfying part of coding,

116
00:07:45.137 --> 00:07:47.341
in my opinion that you can ever do.

117
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:49.285
Delete everything.

118
00:07:49.285 --> 00:07:53.184
I love to deleting code is literally
my favorite part of my job.

119
00:07:53.184 --> 00:07:56.053
Like I feel like you're doing things
right when you get to delete things.

120
00:07:58.021 --> 00:08:01.580
And then I want you to
put three lines here.

121
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.215
At tailwind base,

122
00:08:05.215 --> 00:08:10.214
at tailwind Components,

123
00:08:10.214 --> 00:08:14.994
at tailwind utilities.

124
00:08:17.687 --> 00:08:20.531
This is like a directive and
that's what tailwind CSS,

125
00:08:20.531 --> 00:08:23.204
that library that we installed
is going to do for us.

126
00:08:23.204 --> 00:08:26.670
This is basically saying like include
all of these parts of tailwind so

127
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.620
the base components the base parts the
components parts and all the utilities.
