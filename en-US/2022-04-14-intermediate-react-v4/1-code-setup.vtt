1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.740
We starting here in Intermediate React.

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.390
This is basically what I just told you.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.064
So let's go ahead and
go clone our repo here.

4
00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.846
Specifically, again,
we want the 12 portals and refs one, so

5
00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:16.490
just get used to copying and
pasting this over and over again.

6
00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.835
So I'm gonna go, I'm gonna clone this.

7
00:00:22.835 --> 00:00:24.252
So I'm just gonna clone to my desktop.

8
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.143
That's fine, okay,
I'm just gonna say git clone, blah.

9
00:00:38.585 --> 00:00:40.754
But don't do that twice,
what are you doing?

10
00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:46.148
How dare you?

11
00:00:46.148 --> 00:00:51.061
Okay, so now I got my project app here.

12
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:53.412
And I'm just gonna keep
this outside of it so.

13
00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:57.290
Whatever, that's fine.

14
00:00:59.923 --> 00:01:06.022
I'm gonna say copy -R, you can do this
totally just by saying, open, blah, right?

15
00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:08.083
I'm just doing this directly here.

16
00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:12.895
I'm just gonna be copying and
pasting this, right?

17
00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:16.975
So now, I have a complete copy of
the repo here and 12-portals-and refs.

18
00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:23.874
You can even just rename it to something
like intermediate, or something like that.

19
00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:28.348
And then I'm just gonna copying in, right,
working on it and then blowing it away and

20
00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:30.100
recopying it every single time.

21
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.333
Okay, and so
I'm just gonnna code intermediate.

22
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:35.845
And now, I have this open.

23
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:41.019
So, let's go ahead and

24
00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:44.310
get a little acquainted with
what's going on in this project.

25
00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:51.154
First thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna run
npm install to get all of my dependencies

26
00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:51.939
installed.

27
00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.818
And let's look at what
dependencies we installed here.

28
00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:02.269
So, you can see here,
this is a eslint project, so

29
00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:06.829
we have all of our eslint checking,
so that'll help.

30
00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.104
It's a pretty minimal config,

31
00:02:09.104 --> 00:02:13.578
it's mostly just like did you
declare variable and not use it?

32
00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:15.809
Are you using a variable
that you didn't declare?

33
00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.433
Things like that.

34
00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.543
And then there's some React specific
rules like the Hooks rules and

35
00:02:21.543 --> 00:02:23.859
accessibility and things like that.

36
00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:31.124
It's using parcel 2 for the build process,
which is a really nice build tool.

37
00:02:31.124 --> 00:02:34.342
If you haven't used it,
if you're not familiar with it,

38
00:02:34.342 --> 00:02:37.112
just go check out that
section on Intros to React.

39
00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:39.080
It's using prettier as a code formatter.

40
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.080
So if you see my code shifting
around every time that I save,

41
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.400
it's prettier reformatting it.

42
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.691
It does have class properties
coming in from babel, so

43
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:56.901
that we can do es 2022 class properties.

44
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:02.408
Were using React version 17.0.2.

45
00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:06.745
Again, React 18 is about to come out but
it has not come out yet.

46
00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:10.856
And then you can see here
we're using react-router-dom.

47
00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.917
And let's see the app code here is pretty
straightforward, React Router app.

48
00:03:18.917 --> 00:03:19.985
There's two routes.

49
00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:23.408
There's details and there's the homepage.

50
00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:24.673
You can see that it's using some context.

51
00:03:24.673 --> 00:03:29.060
There's error boundaries,
there's a search page.

52
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.540
Let's actually just,
I guess, get this running.

53
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.294
If you come down here into your app,
you just say npm run dev,

54
00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:36.036
and that should start the dev server.

55
00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:42.403
On local host 1234, you can see it's
a nice little pet adoption app here.

56
00:03:42.403 --> 00:03:46.519
So you can search for dogs,
and if I click Submit,

57
00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.343
you'll see here that
these are now just dogs.

58
00:03:50.343 --> 00:03:56.711
If I change that to be cats,
Submit, it'll be just cats.

59
00:03:56.711 --> 00:04:01.292
And you can see that contextually it will
show you breeds from the various different

60
00:04:01.292 --> 00:04:01.889
animals.

61
00:04:04.414 --> 00:04:09.522
And it's doing this by
requesting against an API

62
00:04:09.522 --> 00:04:16.011
that Frontend Masters hosts,
called the dev API's pet API.

63
00:04:16.011 --> 00:04:20.957
Okay, so that's just kind of
a whirlwind tour of the app.

64
00:04:20.957 --> 00:04:27.041
If you click on one of these,
it'll take you to their details page.

65
00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:31.975
So you can see this is my tiny
cute little Drip dog, Luna.

66
00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:35.423
There's a carousel here that you can
click on the various different pictures.

67
00:04:35.423 --> 00:04:40.077
And then you can click Adopt,
and that'll pop up a modal.

68
00:04:40.077 --> 00:04:41.697
And if you click this, it will go back.

69
00:04:41.697 --> 00:04:42.598
That's the entire app.

70
00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:44.412
It's relatively simple.

71
00:04:44.412 --> 00:04:49.623
It's meant so that you can just see
all the various different pets.

72
00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:53.114
So again, to reiterate
the various different sections,

73
00:04:53.114 --> 00:04:55.260
do not build on each other, right?

74
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.527
They're all kind of self-contained silos.

75
00:04:56.527 --> 00:05:02.037
So if you do code splitting,
you're gonna have to reset your repo and

76
00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:05.558
go back for server side rendering, right?

77
00:05:05.558 --> 00:05:08.287
We're not gonna do code splitting and
server side rendering at the same time.

78
00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:11.757
Okay.

79
00:05:14.783 --> 00:05:16.761
So the first thing I wanna do,
I've now shown you this entire app.

80
00:05:16.761 --> 00:05:20.670
I've got you to clone it, and
we're gonna ignore it for a little bit.
