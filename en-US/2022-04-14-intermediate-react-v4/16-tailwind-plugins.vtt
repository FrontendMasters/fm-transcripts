1
00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:07.466
The next thing that we're
gonna work on here is inputs.

2
00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:10.908
We wanna make these look
like not hot garbage.

3
00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:14.474
So low bar here [LAUGH].

4
00:00:14.474 --> 00:00:19.276
Luckily, Tailwind CSS does have a bunch
of kinda pre made form stuff for

5
00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:23.775
you that you can just use because
kind of a solved problem, right?

6
00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:25.560
It's not very fun styling forms.

7
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.409
I don't know about you,
but I've styled hundreds,

8
00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:36.030
thousands, let's go with
thousands of inputs in my career.

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.257
So first thing we're gonna
install into the library here,

10
00:00:41.257 --> 00:00:47.333
stop your server say npm install- D,
and we're gonna do @tailwind

11
00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:55.742
Css/forms@0.4.0

12
00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:05.330
Okay, this is gonna give
us a tailwind plugin.

13
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.596
So you can run your server again if you
want, actually not, leave it for a second.

14
00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:13.603
Go over to your tailwind config .js and
then here in plugins,

15
00:01:13.603 --> 00:01:18.162
we're just gonna add one little
thing here, I'm gonna say require,

16
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:26.013
@tailwindcss/forms.

17
00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:31.665
Okay, now this will include
a bunch of stuff for

18
00:01:31.665 --> 00:01:34.823
us that'll take care of a lot
of our form styling for us.

19
00:01:34.823 --> 00:01:38.488
So now if you say npm run dev,
get our server up and

20
00:01:38.488 --> 00:01:41.635
running again and refresh our page here.

21
00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:43.891
Note, it still doesn't look great, but

22
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:48.152
notice that this ended up looking a little
bit closer to looking nice, right?

23
00:01:48.152 --> 00:01:50.073
So we're getting there.

24
00:01:50.073 --> 00:01:54.975
So it just has a bunch of default styles,
but we can make this look a lot nicer.

25
00:01:57.165 --> 00:02:02.281
So first thing kind of wisely they do for
their CSS here is they just

26
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:08.346
don't style input texts, unless you put
the style or type equals text on it.

27
00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:12.276
So good, head back over to search params.

28
00:02:12.276 --> 00:02:16.511
And here on this input here,
notice we don't have a type on here,

29
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:19.520
which implicitly makes
it a type equals text.

30
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.991
They want you to explicitly go in here and
say type equals text.

31
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:30.376
So now if you go back over here,
notice that now it looks nice, right?

32
00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:33.376
They're just trying to
make you be explicit.

33
00:02:33.376 --> 00:02:36.619
And they don't want their CSS selectors to

34
00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:41.314
be overly greedy cuz none of us
have done that before, right?

35
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:43.624
Some guilty looks on people's faces.

36
00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:50.845
Okay, so to each of the inputs and
selects here,

37
00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:55.931
let's just go ahead and
add kind of the same thing here.

38
00:02:55.931 --> 00:03:01.828
We're gonna say, className=,
and then we're gonna add W60,

39
00:03:01.828 --> 00:03:06.185
which is with 15,
remember about 40 pixels.

40
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:10.595
Margin bottom five and block.

41
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.151
Okay, and then I want you to take an add
that, just you can copy and paste and

42
00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:18.720
put it on all the selects as well.

43
00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:25.588
Order is not important here.

44
00:03:28.537 --> 00:03:29.132
Okay?

45
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:34.140
So now if we go back over to here,

46
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.708
starting to look significantly better,
right?

47
00:03:38.708 --> 00:03:41.607
The block, put it on a different line
from this, that made it look better.

48
00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:44.766
We have a nice uniform width now,
that helps,

49
00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:48.260
some nice spacing with some
margin bottom on that.

50
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.370
And, yeah, again it's hard not to find it
impressive, we just did a little bit and

51
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.313
we ended up with something fairly
nice on the other side of that.

52
00:04:02.222 --> 00:04:06.152
Okay, and this one right now,
if we put this to blank,

53
00:04:06.152 --> 00:04:11.718
technically this is disabled at
the moment, but it doesn't look disabled.

54
00:04:11.718 --> 00:04:17.727
So we now we need to go and add a disabled
opacity to that breed selector.

55
00:04:17.727 --> 00:04:19.388
So head back over to breed.

56
00:04:21.682 --> 00:04:24.313
This one is theme,
we need to go up to breed.

57
00:04:24.313 --> 00:04:28.875
So this is breed,
we need to add one more here that's

58
00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:33.552
gonna be disabled, colon,
let's do opacity 50.

59
00:04:35.767 --> 00:04:39.802
So when it's disabled, it's just
gonna make it see through partially.

60
00:04:42.336 --> 00:04:45.104
Now you can see this looks grayed out,
right?

61
00:04:45.104 --> 00:04:48.009
It makes it look disabled and
as soon as we put in bird or

62
00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.924
something like that,
now it's re-enabled again.

63
00:04:52.615 --> 00:04:55.100
Now one thing you might
be catching on to here,

64
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.475
it's a lot of repeating yourself, right?

65
00:04:57.475 --> 00:05:00.867
As opposed to putting one class name
that applies itself multiple times,

66
00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:03.614
there's ways to mitigate that
entails tailwind CSS test.

67
00:05:03.614 --> 00:05:07.542
You can easily do that with react and I
can have a select component that I use and

68
00:05:07.542 --> 00:05:09.780
then just apply that
to the site component,

69
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.547
that's probably what I would do.

70
00:05:11.547 --> 00:05:16.081
But there's other more advanced ways of
using Tailwind we can kind of make your

71
00:05:16.081 --> 00:05:18.701
own kind of classes of
Tailwind components.

72
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.432
I'm gonna leave that to the tailwind
class whenever that gets tied on for

73
00:05:21.432 --> 00:05:21.979
the Masters.

74
00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.745
I don't really wanna
get too much into that.

75
00:05:23.745 --> 00:05:26.859
I'm kinda just trying to
get you introduced here.

76
00:05:29.751 --> 00:05:34.473
Okay, let's go, obviously our
button is not great at the moment.

77
00:05:34.473 --> 00:05:38.198
I don't know,
maybe you like that [LAUGH], I don't.

78
00:05:38.198 --> 00:05:41.024
So let's go add a little
bit of style to that.

79
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.559
Okay, I'm just gonna put it here
cuz I know prettier will fix it.

80
00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:54.373
Rounded, obviously rounded buttons,
everyone likes that.

81
00:05:54.373 --> 00:06:01.826
Px-6, so this is padding in the left
right direction of 6, py-2.

82
00:06:01.826 --> 00:06:05.222
So padding in the up
down direction have 2.

83
00:06:09.873 --> 00:06:13.295
I don't know, I have to color here.

84
00:06:13.295 --> 00:06:18.410
Text-white hover, opacity 50,

85
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.527
so that the button looks clickable.

86
00:06:23.527 --> 00:06:26.540
And let's do border none.

87
00:06:34.154 --> 00:06:35.742
See what that looks like?

88
00:06:37.603 --> 00:06:40.606
That looks like a respectable button.
