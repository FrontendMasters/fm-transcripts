00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.425
Welcome to Intermediate react version 4.

2
00:00:03.425 --> 00:00:08.308
What I would like you to do right now is I

3
00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:13.660
want you to go get on bit.li/reactv7.

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.388
Make sure that's all lowercase, no spaces,
and that should take you to this page,

5
00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:23.360
there's just a short link, so you don't
have to type all of this business out.

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.803
The intro to react and intermediate
react website of the same one,

7
00:00:27.803 --> 00:00:31.846
so you can see the first part of
this is all the intro part, and

8
00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:36.308
then down here section 8 is where
intermediate react V4 starts.

9
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:42.830
So the way that this course works,
as opposed to the way that intro worked.

10
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.581
Intro worked, we built one entire
projects, beginning to end,

11
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:47.890
every section built on the previous one.

12
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.499
This one works a little bit differently
because with intermediate react,

13
00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:55.219
I want you to be able to kind of pick and
choose so the concepts you wanna learn so

14
00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.483
you don't have to go learn things
that you're not interested in and

15
00:00:58.483 --> 00:01:00.976
you can just kind of stick
to the ones that you want.

16
00:01:00.976 --> 00:01:03.554
So each one of these sections
is in its own silo, right?

17
00:01:03.554 --> 00:01:07.491
So what we're actually gonna do is we're
gonna take the project that we built in

18
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:12.050
complete intro to react V7 and then we're
gonna add additional features just to it.

19
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.890
So if you've taken intro to react V7,
you'll already be up to speed, you'll

20
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.080
already understand all of the concepts
that we went over and the code repo.

21
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.365
For those of you who haven't,

22
00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:24.940
I'm gonna give you like a little brief
tour of what happens in that code.

23
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.440
You do not need to take previous
versions of this course, right?

24
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.515
So you don't need to take v3 or
v2 or v1 of intermediate react.

25
00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:35.220
This is just a like a revision, right?

26
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.040
So we're just keeping
everything up super up to date.

27
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.632
So that when you watch this course,

28
00:01:38.632 --> 00:01:41.690
it's the most up to date react
information you can get.

29
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.630
So we tend to redo this
every 6 months to a year.

30
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.110
Yeah, that's it, it's pretty close.

31
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.773
And we'll definitely be doing version
8 here fairly soon because react 18

32
00:01:52.773 --> 00:01:53.981
is about to come out and

33
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:57.936
that's gonna introduce a bunch of
new intermediate advanced concepts.

34
00:01:57.936 --> 00:02:02.431
So the reason that we're not doing react
version 18 right now is that it's still in

35
00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.580
release candidate.

36
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.840
And I just didn't wanna teach
you anything unstable, right?

37
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.490
They're still changing some things.

38
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.180
They still have like reserve the right to
change some things and some paradigms.

39
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.040
And it's also good to like let
those libraries kind of sit out

40
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.555
in production for a little bit so

41
00:02:15.555 --> 00:02:19.052
we can kind of figure out what patterns
work, what patterns don't work.

42
00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:22.809
So that by the time that I can teach you
these things that you're actually getting

43
00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:26.715
like settled science instead of, Brian
thinks this seems a good idea, good luck.

44
00:02:26.715 --> 00:02:30.750
[LAUGH] I still do that but at least
I'll tell you when I do that to you.

45
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.888
Okay, so who is this course for?

46
00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.475
Hopefully it's for you.

47
00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:41.220
The other thing I'm wanna ask that
you know is JavaScript, HTML.

48
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.888
We'll do a little bit of CSS cuz
we'll talk about it and tailwind, but

49
00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:47.720
it'll be pretty minimal.

50
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.020
We've mostly focused on it like
the JavaScript side of tailwind.

51
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.744
So in other words, some CSS
familiarity will be helpful to you.

52
00:02:56.744 --> 00:03:01.295
And then if you're taking intermediate
now I've asked that you at

53
00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:06.264
least take an intro to react V7, or
are already know react fairly well.

54
00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:09.852
If this is your first exposure to react,
please go take complete intro to react V7

55
00:03:09.852 --> 00:03:13.340
first and then come back here and we'll
talk about the intermediate concepts.

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.506
The setup here, I've tested
everything on Mac OS and Windows 10.

57
00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:22.446
If you're on Windows 11, I'm sorry I'm

58
00:03:22.446 --> 00:03:27.300
not testing that [LAUGH] said as a former
person that worked at Microsoft.

59
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.052
Linux everything should just work just
fine if you use the Mac OS instructions,

60
00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:32.900
I don't think anything has to change.

61
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.507
Please install no-js,
please make sure you're on a node version,

62
00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:46.149
let's say more recent than 12, preferably
14 or above, I think 12 would work but

63
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:51.665
we found out yesterday that 8
definitely doesn't work so don't do 8.

64
00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:54.120
In general, just pretend it didn't happen.

65
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.764
So I have some setup instructions here for
you if you need to go and set up node,

66
00:03:59.764 --> 00:04:01.846
you do not have to use Visual Studio code.

67
00:04:01.846 --> 00:04:04.671
I used to be a pm on Visual Studio code so
I will be using it and

68
00:04:04.671 --> 00:04:08.280
you'll get some cool tips and
tricks and extensions to use.

69
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.370
I added some new ones this time.

70
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.935
So there's some really cool new
Visual Studio code stuff in here that I'll

71
00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:14.790
be teaching you.

72
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.130
So people always ask me
what my coding setup is.

73
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.608
So I just run through that really quick so
people don't tweet me Brian,

74
00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:24.070
tell me about all of your editor settings.

75
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.800
I'm using Mona Lisa.

76
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.280
It's a cool font.

77
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.690
It is not free.

78
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.130
But, people deserve to be paid for
the work, so I'm fine with that.

79
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.009
And I have cold ligatures, enabled which
allows you to have combined glyphs right

80
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.324
so if you put like double equals
make like a log equal sign if

81
00:04:41.324 --> 00:04:44.572
you put triple equals that
make like a triple equal sign,

82
00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:48.994
it'll do things like that and I'll show
you that when I get in my code editor.

83
00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:52.330
You just needed like a certain
kind of font that can do that,

84
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.397
Mona Lisa can do it,
Dank Mono can do that, FIRA code or

85
00:04:55.397 --> 00:05:00.005
actually really quite like Cascadia code,
Cascadia code is put up by Microsoft,

86
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:04.187
it is free and it has code ligatures in
it so go ahead and check that one out.

87
00:05:04.187 --> 00:05:09.611
For my team, I actually just use dark
plus which is the default Vs code theme,

88
00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:12.293
because I have one that I like better.

89
00:05:12.293 --> 00:05:14.860
For the terminal, I actually just
use MAC's built in terminal.

90
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.011
It's fast, it's really fast actually.

91
00:05:19.011 --> 00:05:20.780
But I've used in the past and it's great.

92
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.980
And then on Windows,
I do like Windows terminal.

93
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.820
And then all the cool icons comes from
an extension called VS code icons.

94
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.220
Okay, so where to file issues,
you file issues on the course website.

95
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.390
If you just click here, it allows you
to open issues or open pull requests.

96
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.584
You can see it actually during while
teaching this I've already close to two

97
00:05:47.584 --> 00:05:50.662
issues, and I think close to
pull requests, so I try and

98
00:05:50.662 --> 00:05:52.460
stay on top of these.

99
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.148
So if you find like spelling mistakes or
technical mistakes or

100
00:05:55.148 --> 00:05:58.910
you just wanna tell me that I'm done,
go ahead and do that in the issues.

101
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.080
Or you can tweet to me, that's fine too,
particularly if you need help.

102
00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.738
The best places to go is the issues
because if you're having an issue,

103
00:06:05.738 --> 00:06:09.210
chances is someone else is having
the issue and if you do it, you and

104
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.320
I do it over a DMs, that I have to
solve that problem for everyone, right?

105
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.664
Whereas if we do it on like issues,
then anyone can go to the GitHub repo and

106
00:06:17.664 --> 00:06:20.340
find the problems and
solve them from there.

107
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.550
So that's why I like doing
it all in the issues.

108
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.890
Okay, who am I?

109
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.010
I'm Brian.

110
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.680
I work at stripe.

111
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.300
I am the product manager
of developer tools.

112
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.527
So I work on like the VS code extension,
the stripe CLI,

113
00:06:36.527 --> 00:06:40.717
the stripe server side SDK is
the React Native SDK, test and sandboxes,

114
00:06:40.717 --> 00:06:45.733
all sorts of, basically if you're writing
using tools to build stripe integration,

115
00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:48.369
that's the stuff that
I manage it at stripe.

116
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.930
Before that I worked on Azure and
I worked on visual studio code as a PM and

117
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.240
then before that I was a JavaScript
developer for a decade.

118
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.380
And I wrote a lot of React at
places like Netflix and Reddit.

119
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.450
I launched Reddit's first react code.

120
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.690
That's one of my claims to fame.

121
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.570
I did that in 2014.

122
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.182
So I've been writing react for
quite a few years,

123
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:17.686
I was a early adopter of React and I'm
happy that I made the right call there,

124
00:07:17.686 --> 00:07:21.642
[LAUGH] I wrote a lot of Angular
before that Angular 1 and

125
00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:26.227
I also wrote a decent amount of
ember when I worked at LinkedIn.

126
00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:31.620
So I like teaching in front of Masters.

127
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.533
I'm here fairly frequently.

128
00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:34.430
I live in Seattle.

129
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.770
I like to hang out with my wife and
I actually just had a kid in December.

130
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:40.350
He's very cute.

131
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.071
And I also still have my
adorable little jerk dog Luna,

132
00:07:46.071 --> 00:07:50.105
who I still talk about in
every course that I teach.

133
00:07:50.105 --> 00:07:53.841
When I'm not doing technical stuff or
hanging out with my family,

134
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:57.900
I like exercising, I played data and
overwatch very poorly.

135
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.647
And I drink a lot of
Scotch cuz I like Scotch.

136
00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:05.210
Feel free to catch up with me on socials.

137
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.530
I'm terrible at answering DMs.

138
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.740
I disclaim that a lot because people get
sad that I don't answer all the DMs.

139
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:16.371
But feel free to tweet me, I'm pretty
good at answering public tweets.

140
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.391
And then yeah, so there's two repos for
this particular website or for

141
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:22.280
this particular class.

142
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.760
There's the website 1.

143
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.010
So if you go here, this is where
actually all of the lessons are.

144
00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.742
You can see here, they're all just
organized here into markdown files.

145
00:08:31.742 --> 00:08:32.780
Right, and it's all here.

146
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.190
So if you find something to fix,
that's where you wanna go do it.

147
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.622
And then what you need to go clone
right now is the example projects.

148
00:08:43.949 --> 00:08:48.372
So this is step by step all of
the various different states of the repo

149
00:08:48.372 --> 00:08:51.390
that we're gonna be using, right?

150
00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.635
So for example, you can see here
that there's a Redux 1, right, and

151
00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:58.270
this is gonna be the state of the world
after we do the Redux portion of the site.

152
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:04.140
So it's good for you to be able to see
what's changing what I'm writing up here?

153
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.331
So if you fall behind,
you can go in here, you can click on,

154
00:09:10.331 --> 00:09:14.540
what his results look like right now and
you can see that here, right?

155
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:18.892
Specifically, the ones you need to
be concerned with is, 1 through 12,

156
00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:21.960
here's what we built in
complete intro to react V7.

157
00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.110
For all of our various different sections,
we're gonna take this step 12 1, and

158
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.720
we're just going to reclone it and
reuse it again, and

159
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:34.010
we're gonna start fresh with that
particular project every single time.

160
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.284
So just get used to copying and
reinstalling the dependencies for

161
00:09:38.284 --> 00:09:40.780
this particular folder right there.

162
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.450
And I'll show you what I
mean once we get into it.

163
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.408
Okay, if you have issues with the content,
please just either fix them and

164
00:09:51.408 --> 00:09:53.840
open a PR or
leave a issue on the course website.

165
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.210
So check that one more than the project 1.

166
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:01.263
And then just kind of a overview of
the website here that you're looking at in

167
00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:02.430
front of you.

168
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:03.930
These are literally my courses.

169
00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.490
You can see that I have
two computers here.

170
00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.534
On this computer,
I'm not just on Reddit or

171
00:10:08.534 --> 00:10:12.250
something like that I am, but it's fine,
you don't have to worry about that.

172
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.785
But I also have the course
website up here, and

173
00:10:14.785 --> 00:10:17.130
I'm just reading off my notes here.

174
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.060
And I open source all those notes so
that you can use them, you can share them,

175
00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.403
you can refer to them later,
you can send them to your co workers.

176
00:10:24.403 --> 00:10:26.490
It's meant to be a kind of
a companion site here, so

177
00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:27.910
you can see what I'm seeing here.

178
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:33.444
&gt;&gt; What do you think separates
a good react engineer

179
00:10:33.444 --> 00:10:36.216
from a great react engineer?

180
00:10:36.216 --> 00:10:39.630
&gt;&gt; It's a good question.

181
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.216
What separates a good react engineer
from a great react engineer?

182
00:10:44.216 --> 00:10:46.720
I don't know if I can think of
anything that's gonna be particularly

183
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.240
tailored to react.

184
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.970
In general, the best engineers that
I've worked with communicate super well.

185
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:59.791
And when I say that they, like let's say,
I come into your office and

186
00:10:59.791 --> 00:11:04.729
I say, hey, I need you to build this
new search functionality that allows

187
00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:09.490
users to checkout faster or
something like that, right?

188
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:13.595
A good engineer is going to ask a lot of
follow up questions so that they can get

189
00:11:13.595 --> 00:11:17.895
the product requirements down to like,
okay, we need to build this and this and

190
00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:20.912
this and so
they understand the problem domain really,

191
00:11:20.912 --> 00:11:23.834
really well before they
start working on something.

192
00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:28.092
That has been historically that the
engineers I've seen that perform the best

193
00:11:28.092 --> 00:11:30.866
at can take something
that's really ambiguous and

194
00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:35.213
distill it down to step by step steps that
they can then go out and build, right?

195
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:41.309
It's a really junior engineer kind
of move to go in and just say, okay,

196
00:11:41.309 --> 00:11:42.416
I'll build it.

197
00:11:42.416 --> 00:11:44.238
And then they just go build something and

198
00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.334
it's not what was actually
meant to be built.

199
00:11:48.281 --> 00:11:51.754
So those kinds of like human
interaction personal skills like,

200
00:11:51.754 --> 00:11:54.680
that's what makes the best engineers.

201
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.085
I'll say that when I worked at Netflix
which is probably the hardest front end

202
00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:02.063
work that I ever had to do,
it was the most advanced,

203
00:12:02.063 --> 00:12:04.285
was the most performance sensitive.

204
00:12:04.285 --> 00:12:07.606
95% of my job there could have been
done by literally any junior engineer

205
00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:08.510
anywhere, right?

206
00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:11.781
It was just mostly marshaling
JavaScript and CSS around,

207
00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:15.160
which most of us can do fairly well,
right?

208
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.480
It was that last 5% that
was really difficult.

209
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.982
Scaling problems or problems that you run
into that you can't just Google and say,

210
00:12:21.982 --> 00:12:23.460
how do I do x, right?

211
00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.168
And that was what the senior part of my
senior engineering title kind of came in

212
00:12:27.168 --> 00:12:31.350
is like, okay, I've seen this before at
Reddit, this happened we did these things.

213
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:33.140
This didn't work and this didn't happen.

214
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.950
So that experience helps a lot as well.

215
00:12:42.034 --> 00:12:44.817
Trying to think if there's anything else
that I would really say that sets apart

216
00:12:44.817 --> 00:12:46.440
a great engineer.

217
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.195
It really comes down to communication and
experience are really the two things that

218
00:12:50.195 --> 00:12:53.100
are gonna set people apart as they
move forward in their career.

219
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:59.253
The most effective engineers like
know how to work well with others and

220
00:12:59.253 --> 00:13:02.580
like be a force multiplier for
their entire team.

221
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.276
Like we've heard of the mythical 10x
engineer helps other people be twice as

222
00:13:06.276 --> 00:13:07.730
productive, right?

223
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.970
If they can do that for
five people then they are a 10x engineer.
