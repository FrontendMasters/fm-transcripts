00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.330
So the next one we're gonna
work on is use layout effect.

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.570
This is a kind of particular hook that
you're really should only rarely use.

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.790
So as you can see it has
the term use effect.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.584
It's very,
very similar to effect to use effect, and

5
00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:23.230
what I wanna say is you should
almost always use effect.

6
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.060
Use layout effect is peculiar for
one reason.

7
00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.872
With use effect,
your effect is scheduled to happen later.

8
00:00:31.872 --> 00:00:35.948
You actually don't have
a guarantee of when that is,

9
00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:41.030
that could be immediately,
that could be another milliseconds.

10
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.466
Usually not more than like
a millisecond later but

11
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.670
my point being is that
it's a synchronous and

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.557
therefore you cannot reliably say this
is the next thing that's gonna happen.

13
00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:53.095
With use layout effect is that you
are guaranteed that it's synchronous it's

14
00:00:53.095 --> 00:00:54.819
the next thing that's gonna happen.

15
00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.783
So with this layout effect component,
it's going to render and then guaranteed

16
00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:04.610
synchronously the next thing that it's
going to happen is use layout effect.

17
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.862
If you were doing use effect, it could be,

18
00:01:07.862 --> 00:01:10.300
something else could happen
between now and then.

19
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.130
Now you might be thinking why do I care?

20
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.770
Typically you don't, right?

21
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.030
Do you care if you make a API call now or
in like a half millisecond?

22
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.530
You don't really care, right?

23
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.160
Functionally to you and
your user, it's the same thing.

24
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.269
And it's better because react can do
a bunch of performance optimizations and,

25
00:01:28.269 --> 00:01:32.320
future optimizations that we
don't know about yet, right?

26
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.289
So in other words, always use, use effect,

27
00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.490
only use the layout effect for
one of two reasons.

28
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.000
The first one is what I'm showing you
here and let's take a look at this.

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.050
I had this little text area here and
I have this thing that measures it.

30
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.890
This is when you want
to use Layout effect.

31
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.848
Because now I can actually
precisely measure my DOM and

32
00:02:00.848 --> 00:02:03.418
I can be guaranteed that
as soon as this ends I'm

33
00:02:03.418 --> 00:02:07.810
getting the precise measurement of this
whenever this click and drag finishes.

34
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.030
With use effect I have less guarantees
of when that's going to run.

35
00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.740
So I don't know if I'm gonna get precisely
the the measurement that I want, right?

36
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.462
So in other words for like, that's why
it's called use layout effect is because

37
00:02:23.462 --> 00:02:26.728
it's mostly used for
like measuring for like animations or

38
00:02:26.728 --> 00:02:29.930
things that need to be moved
around the DOM, right?

39
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.410
That's what use layout effect is for.

40
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.937
It's for those kinds of precise things we,

41
00:02:33.937 --> 00:02:36.814
the measurements end up
being really important.

42
00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:41.278
That's what it's made for,
that's the whole use case right there.

43
00:02:41.278 --> 00:02:46.393
The other interesting application for
this is,

44
00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:51.395
is this is how component
did mount used to work.

45
00:02:51.395 --> 00:02:55.970
If you remember in class components that
we talked about in intro, we had there was

46
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.829
a life cycle method on class
components called component did mount.

47
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.390
This is the same way that
component demounted worked.

48
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.734
So if you're migrating from a class
component to a function component and

49
00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:12.921
it matters to you how
that was being called,

50
00:03:12.921 --> 00:03:18.717
this is how you can emulate that behavior
perfectly, as opposed to use effect.

51
00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:22.432
Which has a slight semantic difference
in terms of when it acts execute.

52
00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:25.879
However, this should be a temporary fix,
you should always try and

53
00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.709
eventually get to use the fact instead
of hacking apart use layout effect.

54
00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:34.890
Again, I've only ever had to use this for
animations.

55
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.504
So that's really the only thing I
can think of to tell you when you

56
00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:41.480
should use layout effect.
