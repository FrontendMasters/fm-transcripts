00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.594
One last thing here, I want you to

2
00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:10.308
go install the Redux dev tools.

3
00:00:10.308 --> 00:00:14.816
So here I have them linked or
you can just Google it, for

4
00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:19.326
Firefox and Chrome,
the Chrome one will work on Edge.

5
00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:22.429
And I don't, actually there
might be a Safari one for Redux,

6
00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.770
that one I don't know,
you'd have to check.

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.023
But certainly for Firefox and Chrome, So

8
00:00:30.023 --> 00:00:32.876
then happened to your page
once you got that installed,

9
00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:35.858
I already have installed but
you just add it here, right?

10
00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:42.619
And I don't know Methusellah but
Timdorr is he's

11
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:47.264
the maintainer React Redux,
really smart guy.

12
00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:52.484
Okay, so
now I can open my dev tools here and

13
00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:57.561
I can open my Redux Dev tools right there.

14
00:00:57.561 --> 00:01:01.281
And what's really cool about this is
now I can see every single action

15
00:01:01.281 --> 00:01:04.181
that's been dispatched and
I can see it in real time.

16
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:08.890
So if I like, let's go back to
the homepage, if I do animal and

17
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.603
I change that to bird,
right you can see here my,

18
00:01:12.603 --> 00:01:15.701
the change animal, thank, you right?

19
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.497
So that's really cool, or
if I change this to be cockatoo, or

20
00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:24.182
something like that, you can see all
of the actions happening in real time.

21
00:01:24.182 --> 00:01:28.054
But here's where this starts
getting a little bananas,

22
00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.452
I can actually start
stepping backwards in time.

23
00:01:31.452 --> 00:01:35.537
So if I click this little arrow and
watch my UI because it'll change, right?

24
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.181
So I'm actually stepping backwards through
and I can go backwards and forwards,

25
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.085
this is called time traveling debugging.

26
00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:48.521
As you can probably imagine,
this is incredibly useful for

27
00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:50.838
trying to figure out why
things are happening, right?

28
00:01:50.838 --> 00:01:53.361
If I can step through,
this action happened and

29
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:58.042
then this action happened then this, okay,
I understand where this where this broke.

30
00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:02.643
One of the first companies I worked at,
whenever a person's app crash,

31
00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:07.331
we would dump their entire Redux store and
all the actions that happened.

32
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:10.473
And then we'd send it to our logging
service and so that we the developers

33
00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:13.888
could then load it up and say, okay,
this is where the user was wrong, right?

34
00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:15.388
That was incredibly useful.

35
00:02:18.124 --> 00:02:21.622
Okay, and you can actually even just
press so if I press play, right?

36
00:02:21.622 --> 00:02:24.748
So, if I press play it'll actually just
go through in order you can watch it go

37
00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:25.913
through the entire domain.

38
00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:30.536
Seems like what happens if
I just skipped this one so

39
00:02:30.536 --> 00:02:34.231
you can click Skip It'll actually skip
that action and then just run it all

40
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:38.045
again now you might be thinking like how
do they figure out like do and redo and

41
00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:41.977
all that kind of stuff it's not that
complicated they actually just start from

42
00:02:41.977 --> 00:02:44.151
the beginning and they just apply all the.

43
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:46.464
Actions in order, right?

44
00:02:46.464 --> 00:02:49.696
Because if you have discrete actions, you
have to know all you have to know is how

45
00:02:49.696 --> 00:02:52.119
to go forward, you don't have
to know how to go backwards.

46
00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:58.849
Okay, and I won't get into
everything this is can do, but

47
00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.136
there's a lot of very cool things.

48
00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:05.623
I can actually see what the action looked
like this was a change animal with Payload

49
00:03:05.623 --> 00:03:06.152
of bird.

50
00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:13.192
That's cool, I can see the current state
at this time I can see a state chart.

51
00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:16.536
Right, so I have the state, but
if you have like dependency ones,

52
00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:19.344
you can actually go down into
like several layers of it,

53
00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:21.882
which if you have a big app,
you definitely will.

54
00:03:21.882 --> 00:03:25.032
You can actually use combined reducer
multiple times to generate multiple

55
00:03:25.032 --> 00:03:25.534
reducers.

56
00:03:25.534 --> 00:03:31.162
That's helpful, you can see the diff,
this is what changed, right?

57
00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:34.847
This went from empty string
to cockatoo that's useful,

58
00:03:37.805 --> 00:03:41.142
I haven't used trace that actually
sounds really interesting, but

59
00:03:41.142 --> 00:03:42.415
I have not tried that yet.

60
00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:44.953
But perhaps one of the most useful things

61
00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:47.944
is this selection just generate tests for
you.

62
00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:51.949
So you can say, all right,
I have this reducer,

63
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:57.057
given this state, given this change,
I expect it to be this.

64
00:03:57.057 --> 00:03:58.587
If you like, if this is already correct,

65
00:03:58.587 --> 00:04:00.527
you're gonna say alright,
generate a test for me.

66
00:04:00.527 --> 00:04:03.960
You just copy and paste that into your
test suite, bam, you've written a test.

67
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.096
The best kind of test is the one
that I didn't have to write but

68
00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:11.145
it's actually still a good test,
which this arguably is a very good test.

69
00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:17.764
Okay, and this, I'm looking at jest but
there's mocha tape and Athan here as well.

70
00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:25.106
So that is very compelling as well,
Okay, so

71
00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:31.014
this is one of the probably the most
compelling reason to you is Redux,

72
00:04:31.014 --> 00:04:34.533
is like the dev tools are pretty awesome.

73
00:04:37.565 --> 00:04:40.997
Any questions about that or
about we're done with Redux now so

74
00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:42.847
any more questions about Redux?

75
00:04:45.405 --> 00:04:48.734
I'll point out that the redux
folder is now up to date here so

76
00:04:48.734 --> 00:04:49.873
you can hop on that.

77
00:04:49.873 --> 00:04:52.553
And there is a awesome course from Mr.

78
00:04:52.553 --> 00:04:56.249
Steve Kenny on that,
that's way deeper into this.

79
00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.965
So definitely check that out if you're
interested in more state management

80
00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.705
libraries for JavaScript and
particularly for react.
