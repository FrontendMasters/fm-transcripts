1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.510
Let's do some grid.

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.313
This is probably the part where I
melted my mind the most of like, okay,

3
00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:08.849
I get to Tailwind now.

4
00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.970
Obviously, this does not
look good at the moment,

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.396
where they're just kind of
all over the place, right?

6
00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:20.760
In 30 seconds, we're gonna make this
look amazing with CSS Grid and Tailwind.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.377
It's upsetting how fast this goes.

8
00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:30.145
Okay, so head to Results.js, okay?

9
00:00:30.145 --> 00:00:35.272
And the outermost div,
instead of search here,

10
00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:41.284
we're gonna have this be
grid gap-4 grid-cols-2.

11
00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:48.303
So just that.

12
00:00:48.303 --> 00:00:51.464
Save that, come back over here,
and already,

13
00:00:51.464 --> 00:00:54.166
this is looking a billion times better.

14
00:00:56.674 --> 00:00:58.530
Still not quite there, obviously.

15
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.581
But three CSS classes got us from
hot garbage to just it's like

16
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:06.190
lukewarm garbage.

17
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.954
[LAUGH] All right, so

18
00:01:08.954 --> 00:01:13.833
let's make it a little bit better,

19
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:18.236
grid gap-4 grid-cols-1.

20
00:01:18.236 --> 00:01:19.920
Let's do some breakpoints.

21
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.085
So now we're gonna say,
at the small breakpoint,

22
00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.330
make a grid-cols-2, okay,

23
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.149
at the large breakpoint, do grid-cols-3.

24
00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:42.151
So again, back over here,
we're at the large breakpoint.

25
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.290
So now it's putting three side by side.

26
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.493
If we make it smaller,
eventually, it'll go to two.

27
00:01:50.493 --> 00:01:53.841
Let's close that, and
eventually, it'll go to one.

28
00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:02.328
You can't tell me that it's not
pretty damn compelling, right?

29
00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:09.241
I'm just thinking back to my
days when I was first writing.

30
00:02:09.241 --> 00:02:12.532
I became a professional developer in 2011.

31
00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:17.022
How damn long this used to
take me to do this, right?

32
00:02:17.022 --> 00:02:21.212
And now just this, again,
I'm gonna put on my old man hand and

33
00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:25.400
say I used to walk uphill both
ways in the snow, but holy hell,

34
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.760
[LAUGH] it used to be so much harder.

35
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.262
So this is the part where I was like,
okay, I get this.

36
00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:34.219
With some mastery of flexbox and
grid and a little bit of Tailwind CSS,

37
00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:35.907
you can do so much so quickly.

38
00:02:39.474 --> 00:02:43.430
Yeah, super compelling.

39
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.100
So we just did small,
this is obviously the small.

40
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.940
So we do grid-cols-1 so
that by default of 1, right?

41
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.524
So the default is actually this.

42
00:02:54.524 --> 00:03:00.150
And then basically, the small is
everything bigger than minimum 640 pixels.

43
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.259
Everything large, we skip to medium,
there's a medium in there.

44
00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:05.563
1024, everything larger than that,
we go to 3.

45
00:03:05.563 --> 00:03:09.563
And you can keep going to XL, and
triple XL, and things like that.

46
00:03:09.563 --> 00:03:12.620
These are also configurable, by the way.

47
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.617
So there's a bunch of default values for
Tailwind.

48
00:03:15.617 --> 00:03:17.410
I tend to just use whatever
they have as their defaults.

49
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.278
But if you're peculiar that at
this level I would like this,

50
00:03:22.278 --> 00:03:26.485
you can configure that
here in your tailwind.css.

51
00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:27.952
I think it's here in the theme part.

52
00:03:27.952 --> 00:03:31.372
I actually don't remember how
precisely you do it, but it's there.

53
00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:37.442
Results, what else did I wanna say here?

54
00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:42.659
Yeah, there's a double XL,
so there's no triple.

55
00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:52.810
Yeah, so rule of thumb that I just
learned from years of writing CSS and

56
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.787
maintaining large applications using CSS.

57
00:03:56.787 --> 00:03:59.629
I really liked their
approach to breakpoints,

58
00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.528
where they just have set from 0 to
640 is 1, from 640 to 960 is another,

59
00:04:04.528 --> 00:04:10.650
from 960 to 1024, whatever, they're set
and they don't deviate from that by a lot.

60
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:17.660
I used to maintain a website that we
had custom breakpoints for everything.

61
00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.012
And we got so many permutations like,
what if this is in this breakpoint, but

62
00:04:21.012 --> 00:04:23.242
this one's in this one breakpoint,
and this one?

63
00:04:23.242 --> 00:04:26.720
It's 860, which is between four different
breakpoints depending on which component

64
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.700
you're in.

65
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.473
It's a hot mess, never do that.

66
00:04:30.473 --> 00:04:33.150
Just have a set of four breakpoints and
call it good.

67
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.980
We actually used to call our
breakpoints by Starbucks sizes.

68
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.990
So there was the tall,
grande, venti, and trenta.

69
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.840
They do T-shirt sizes,
which is more normal but less fun.
