WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.410
With Apple is similar
a little bit more complicated

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.109
apart from paying the annual amount,
okay, so

3
00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:16.461
we are done with this part so
we are done with the console for now.

4
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:21.479
Now going back to the setup,
so there is no link, okay?

5
00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:28.714
So if you scroll down, there is a section
here that says code generator, okay?

6
00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:34.474
In code generator,
what you have is some kind of

7
00:00:34.474 --> 00:00:41.971
a visual tool to create
the sign-in buttons automatically.

8
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:46.163
The only requirement
before actually pasting

9
00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:51.105
this code is if I go back again
to the top in the setup, or

10
00:00:51.105 --> 00:00:56.598
in fact after the setup,
is to load the client library here.

11
00:00:56.598 --> 00:01:00.980
So that is just copy and
pasting this in my HTML.

12
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.779
By the way, you already have
that here to copy and paste.

13
00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:09.092
Okay, from the companion website.

14
00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:13.833
And you will see this
script body in a second.

15
00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:17.044
In fact, I can just copy it right now.

16
00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:20.083
So I am going to copy and
paste this in my HTML.

17
00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.599
Okay, by the way, brace yourself for
having a lot of messages

18
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.088
in the console right now,
mostly when you are in localhost.

19
00:01:32.088 --> 00:01:36.878
So when you are in localhost,
some things, some security policies when

20
00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:41.448
this library is trying to bring
data from Google, it doesn't work.

21
00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.304
So you will start seeing
errors in the console, okay?

22
00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.599
And that's Google, it's on Google, okay?

23
00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.841
And it's because it's localhost.

24
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.468
But anyway, it will work,
just pray for that.

25
00:01:51.468 --> 00:01:58.860
So now, now that I have the client,
let's go back to our generator here.

26
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.460
So I'm going to look again
To the code generator.

27
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.361
So I need to paste here
my Google client ID.

28
00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:12.445
Where is the Google client ID
in the credential sections?

29
00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:15.968
You can always copy the ID from here.

30
00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:22.199
Okay, so I will paste it here, and
it says, okay, what's the context or

31
00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:27.840
what do you wanna show to the user,
sign in, sign up, or just use?

32
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.613
You pick, it's about the wording.

33
00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:33.051
At the end, it's just the same, okay?

34
00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:37.208
Then, what's the URL for your login?

35
00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:41.752
And if you have a single page application,
we are not going to provide a URL,

36
00:02:41.752 --> 00:02:44.523
we are going to swap to
a JavaScript callback.

37
00:02:44.523 --> 00:02:49.825
So I need to provide a global
function that I will have in my

38
00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:57.235
window global object that will be executed
by Google after a successful login.

39
00:02:57.235 --> 00:02:58.141
Make sense?

40
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:02.887
And for that, that's why I have
this function that I call that

41
00:03:02.887 --> 00:03:06.183
login from Google that receives the data.

42
00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:10.531
And it's sending that data
to our Auth object to

43
00:03:10.531 --> 00:03:14.343
a function that we need to create, okay?

44
00:03:14.343 --> 00:03:20.451
But for now, I'm going to use this name
login from Google, the global function.

45
00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:24.955
So coming back here,
that's the name of my function.

46
00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:32.831
Okay, next and here I need to enable one
of these two options, I can enable both.

47
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:38.111
One tab or sign in with Google,
Sign in with Google

48
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:42.652
is like the, let's say the simplest one.

49
00:03:42.652 --> 00:03:48.026
It's the one that has the icon sign in
with Google, you can customize the theme.

50
00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:53.387
They're not like infinite themes,
but yeah, the blue one, okay.

51
00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:57.337
You can change the text a little bit,

52
00:03:57.337 --> 00:04:02.824
continue with Google or
sign in with a Google name.

53
00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:10.109
Then the height, if you want it to be
small, and kind of that's all, okay?

54
00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:14.193
You can define here what
kind of icon do you prefer?

55
00:04:14.193 --> 00:04:16.009
Also the theme of the icon.

56
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:21.058
But I mean, you cannot do wherever you
want, and by the way, you can see how it

57
00:04:21.058 --> 00:04:26.446
looks like on light themes and dark themes
as well, how it would look like, okay?

58
00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:29.916
So that's like okay, and
also you can prefer redirect or

59
00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:32.969
a popup because we
are a single page application.

60
00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:38.528
We prefer in a pop-up, so
it's not really making any redirects.

61
00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:43.336
It will take the language from user's
computer, but if you wanna force English,

62
00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:44.736
you can do it from here.

63
00:04:44.736 --> 00:04:47.940
If not, it's kind of weird that, I mean,

64
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.961
if you have a browser in Portuguese,
it will appear.

65
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:55.201
I mean, maybe your whole website is in
English and that part is in Portuguese.

66
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.552
So it feels weird.

67
00:04:56.552 --> 00:05:03.641
So some authors or some content creator
for just speaking English and that's all,

68
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:10.445
so it doesn't feel like why is this part
of my websites in a different language.

69
00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:16.126
And one tab is the one that is more
aggressive, turning on or not.

70
00:05:16.126 --> 00:05:21.922
Man is more aggressive because he's
the one that will actually pop up and

71
00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:24.012
leave over your content,

72
00:05:24.012 --> 00:05:30.106
suggesting aggressively to the user to
sign in with one tap to this website.

73
00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:35.875
This is the one that will show your
face on other people's websites,

74
00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:38.663
or it was doing that until today.

75
00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:43.224
And also, you can enable
auto-select credential, okay, and

76
00:05:43.224 --> 00:05:48.384
even on some browsers, ITP browsers here,
you can get what that means.

77
00:05:48.384 --> 00:05:50.603
This is a native dialogue.

78
00:05:50.603 --> 00:05:55.500
I mean, if you are in Chrome on Android,
instead of seeing a div,

79
00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.306
it can pop up a native dialog from
Chrome with your image saying,

80
00:06:00.306 --> 00:06:04.421
do you wanna sign in,
in this website automatically?

81
00:06:04.421 --> 00:06:06.277
And you can disable that
if you don't want that.

82
00:06:06.277 --> 00:06:09.808
Let's be the more aggressive that I can,
okay?

83
00:06:09.808 --> 00:06:11.705
So I will say everything, yes.

84
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:19.061
Get cold, and I just need to copy and
paste this into my HTML somewhere.

85
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:25.032
Okay, so I will copy this,
go back to my HTML.

86
00:06:25.032 --> 00:06:28.171
And let's,
I think I will do that in the login.

87
00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:31.552
I can also do that in the register, but

88
00:06:31.552 --> 00:06:35.781
yeah, after registering
an account instead,

89
00:06:35.781 --> 00:06:40.236
after that,
I could open a new fieldset for this.

90
00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:48.465
I'm going to paste these dips.

91
00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:52.244
Yeah, I don't like them to be dips,
but anyway.

92
00:06:52.244 --> 00:06:55.007
It is what it is.

93
00:06:55.007 --> 00:06:59.735
So by the way, all the properties that
I have should define are there in

94
00:06:59.735 --> 00:07:03.602
data custom properties so
you can change them from here.

95
00:07:03.602 --> 00:07:08.430
So now, I'm saving this, my client ID,
you can see it's public so

96
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:13.177
it's there, that's my public ID,
but maybe you're thinking,

97
00:07:13.177 --> 00:07:17.499
hey, what happens if someone
else is getting my public ID and

98
00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:20.426
publishing this in their own websites?

99
00:07:20.426 --> 00:07:26.117
Well, remember that from the backend
of Google, we need to enable origins.

100
00:07:26.117 --> 00:07:33.784
So Google will not let other
origins to use my client ID.

101
00:07:33.784 --> 00:07:35.348
Make sense?

102
00:07:35.348 --> 00:07:38.565
So now if I go back to my website,

103
00:07:38.565 --> 00:07:43.225
let's do one more thing
before testing this.

104
00:07:43.225 --> 00:07:45.664
Remember the global function that I have?

105
00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:52.808
My global function is calling login
from Google on the Auth object.

106
00:07:52.808 --> 00:07:54.480
That doesn't exist right now.

107
00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.033
So let's create that one.

108
00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:58.884
Login from Google.

109
00:07:58.884 --> 00:08:03.720
And for now let's say,
it receives data, and

110
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.060
it just sending that
data to the console so

111
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.772
we can see what we received
from Google before

112
00:08:12.772 --> 00:08:17.252
connecting this with our backend, okay?

113
00:08:17.252 --> 00:08:21.530
So refreshing.

114
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.790
Well, look at this.

115
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.851
Remember, I already said be careful
because you will start seeing

116
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:29.381
a lot of error messages.

117
00:08:29.381 --> 00:08:31.893
These error messages
are coming from Google.

118
00:08:31.893 --> 00:08:33.818
And it's okay.

119
00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:35.541
Look at this.

120
00:08:35.541 --> 00:08:37.907
And you see that at the bottom.

121
00:08:37.907 --> 00:08:40.846
In fact, let me remove this.

122
00:08:40.846 --> 00:08:44.099
Let's put it there.

123
00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:50.525
So that dialogue, continue as Maximiliano,
that's the aggressive website.

124
00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:57.264
So that's my face, my Gmail account, okay,
continue as Maximiliano with my name,

125
00:08:57.264 --> 00:09:03.835
in a website that this is the first time
I'm visiting, at least from this account.

126
00:09:03.835 --> 00:09:07.773
It's aggressive, okay?

127
00:09:07.773 --> 00:09:10.181
This UI will probably disappear.

128
00:09:10.181 --> 00:09:13.172
It will be less aggressive
in the next years, okay?

129
00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:15.115
But for now, it's there.

130
00:09:15.115 --> 00:09:19.978
If I say, okay, I wanna continue
as Maximiliano, actually, it says,

131
00:09:19.978 --> 00:09:25.268
okay, I need to confirm that I wanna sign
in to Coffee Masters as Maximiliano.

132
00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:26.964
Okay, confirmed.

133
00:09:26.964 --> 00:09:27.984
Verifying.

134
00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.649
Okay, cool.

135
00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:34.035
Everything you saw there are just
dibs on my dome that wasn't

136
00:09:34.035 --> 00:09:38.593
the native experience,
in fact it will happen also in Safari,

137
00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:42.559
because it said or
everything happens in HTML, okay?

138
00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:49.910
So if I inspect now and go to my console
despite all the error messages, okay?

139
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.801
There is an object.

140
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:56.661
And in this object, okay, I have
a client ID, that's my public client ID.

141
00:09:56.661 --> 00:10:00.650
And I have something that says credential,
okay?

142
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.545
And yeah, I have my credential here.

143
00:10:02.545 --> 00:10:06.318
And probably you're thinking,
okay, what's that, okay?

144
00:10:06.318 --> 00:10:08.946
Well, that's a JWT.

145
00:10:08.946 --> 00:10:12.328
Is the JSON Web Token, okay?

146
00:10:12.328 --> 00:10:19.168
And yeah, it feels like nothing
appears as useful from there,

147
00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:23.814
but there are some websites such as jwt.io

148
00:10:23.814 --> 00:10:28.604
where you can actually quickly debug this.

149
00:10:28.604 --> 00:10:32.855
So I can paste this, and
I can see what's inside.

150
00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:40.280
And this is actually a JSON with
data that was encoded as a string,

151
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.985
as what, as one string.

152
00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:45.181
So here you can see my given name,
a family name.

153
00:10:45.181 --> 00:10:47.061
Okay, my picture.

154
00:10:47.061 --> 00:10:51.967
So this is a link to the JPEG of my
face in case you wanna download that and

155
00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:53.971
save that in your database.

156
00:10:53.971 --> 00:10:59.797
Okay, and also you will find
there my email and my AUID.

157
00:10:59.797 --> 00:11:01.752
My audience ID.

158
00:11:01.752 --> 00:11:08.888
Actually, this is kind
of my ID within Google.

159
00:11:08.888 --> 00:11:13.592
So I should save this server side,
that means that's me so

160
00:11:13.592 --> 00:11:18.682
next time, if I login with Google again,
that will be my idea.

161
00:11:18.682 --> 00:11:23.869
By the way, that ID changes per
client to avoid fingerprinting,

162
00:11:23.869 --> 00:11:30.113
okay, so tomorrow if I log in another
website, they will get a different one.

163
00:11:30.113 --> 00:11:33.031
So it's not representing me.

164
00:11:33.031 --> 00:11:34.678
So that is me on this website.
