WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.120
So we have saved credentials.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.610
Now we need to retrieve credentials.

3
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.805
So for that,
I'm going to create another function here.

4
00:00:07.805 --> 00:00:10.881
I will call that autoLogin.

5
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:14.440
Can also be called silent login,
that's another way.

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:21.522
So in this case, again, I will check
if I do have the PasswordCredential,

7
00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:26.423
Class or constructor,
JavaScript constructor.

8
00:00:26.423 --> 00:00:33.671
And I'm going to ask
navigator.credentials.get.

9
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:37.181
And I need the passwords,
not just the username, but

10
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:40.226
you can also ask just for
the username, okay?

11
00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.045
But in this case,
I also want the password.

12
00:00:42.045 --> 00:00:45.096
This is returning a promise,
so I will await for it.

13
00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:47.364
And because I'm having await,

14
00:00:47.364 --> 00:00:52.498
I need to change the signature of my
function and add the async modifier.

15
00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:59.264
And I'm missing also the arrow function,
the arrow character, okay?

16
00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:03.716
So when I have the credentials,
here you have two options.

17
00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:08.002
You can use the credential to
just pre-populate the form or

18
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:09.940
you can just call login.

19
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.390
So you can go to your server and

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.593
login the user without letting
the user know what's going on.

21
00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:18.388
It's your decision, okay?

22
00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:21.870
You have the password, unhashed password.

23
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.119
You have the clear text
password at this point, okay?

24
00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.939
Maybe you'll think, yeah,
but how the browser is.

25
00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.637
Well, the password manager, even if
the password is encrypting the password,

26
00:01:32.637 --> 00:01:37.198
it's encrypting the password in a way
that it can decrypt the password because

27
00:01:37.198 --> 00:01:40.640
we need to send the password
again to the server.

28
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.022
So this is not like the server where
we are hashing the password and

29
00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:46.250
we cannot get back the original password.

30
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.817
Here, client side,
we will get back their password again, and

31
00:01:50.817 --> 00:01:52.940
we can get the password here.

32
00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.357
So I can do a console.log and
we will see the password in the console.

33
00:02:00.357 --> 00:02:02.870
And when to call autoLogin?

34
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.771
When the page loads, for example.

35
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:11.118
And for a to-do homework,
maybe it's a good idea to ask the user

36
00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:17.270
if she wants auto login with a checkbox or
a little UI element.

37
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.870
So it's up to the user if she wants to be
auto-logged in or not next time, okay?

38
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.200
So for now,
I can go back here at the bottom.

39
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.544
I can add a quick Auth.autoLogin when
this class is loaded with this module.

40
00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:37.270
This ECMAScript module is loaded.

41
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.372
That is kind of when the page is loading.

42
00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.599
I'm still not logging in,
just sending that to the console.

43
00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.313
But if I refresh, look what happens now.

44
00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:59.056
So if I refresh the page,
immediately I've got the dialog that says,

45
00:02:59.056 --> 00:03:03.186
hey, do you wanna sign in as Jane or
as Max?

46
00:03:03.186 --> 00:03:08.839
That's my autoLogin
credentials.get dialog.

47
00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:11.144
And there is a promise,
the spending promise.

48
00:03:11.144 --> 00:03:15.400
So if I say Max, okay, if I inspect now,

49
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.291
here I have my password credential.

50
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:24.530
And you can see it has the password,
the plain in plaintext.

51
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.852
If I refresh and now select Jane,
I'm getting Jane's password.

52
00:03:35.791 --> 00:03:39.184
I know it sounds scary.
That means Safari doesn't want this API

53
00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:43.025
because it lets the client
see the password again and

54
00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:45.478
Safari feels like yeah, maybe.

55
00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:50.034
But it's the website anyway, we will get
that password client server side anyway,

56
00:03:50.034 --> 00:03:51.007
right, so yeah.

57
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:58.554
So the next step after we have the
credential is to actually, well, we can

58
00:03:58.554 --> 00:04:03.847
fill the form and decide to click login or
just fill the form, it's up to us.

59
00:04:03.847 --> 00:04:07.400
So once we have the credentials, okay?

60
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.540
So now back here to my autoLogin.

61
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.025
Now that I have the credentials,

62
00:04:14.025 --> 00:04:20.261
I can just change the value of
the login_email with the ID.

63
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.330
Remember here it's called the ID.

64
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.934
So within credentials, it's the ID,
not the username, not the email,

65
00:04:24.934 --> 00:04:25.820
it's called ID.

66
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.006
And for the password, the password.

67
00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:37.642
And it's up to you, okay,
if you wanna force a login right now,

68
00:04:37.642 --> 00:04:44.193
call login, or just let the user
click on the button, it's up to you.

69
00:04:50.262 --> 00:04:52.225
Remember, this is not
going to work in Safari.

70
00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:55.960
This auto retrieval when the page loads,

71
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.341
it will work on
Chromium-based browsers only.

72
00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:06.329
So now if I refresh, I select Jane, okay?

73
00:05:06.329 --> 00:05:10.760
And we have a problem because it says,
hey, we cannot prevent default.

74
00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.860
So it's not working, why?

75
00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.311
Because the login Auth.login was
preventing default on the event.

76
00:05:17.311 --> 00:05:20.145
And now I don't have an event,

77
00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:24.946
so maybe I can just add a quick,
if the event exists.

78
00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:29.256
Because now, okay,
we are not submitting the form, so

79
00:05:29.256 --> 00:05:32.387
there is no event submission in the DOM.

80
00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:37.285
Okay, I'm calling login from my own code.

81
00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:40.519
I'm hard coding that call.

82
00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:44.060
So if I refresh,
I select Jane, it's autologin.

83
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.500
But I should change Jane's password.

84
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.250
So by the way, how can I delete one?

85
00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.810
Let's say I don't want Jane anymore.

86
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.110
Well, as a user,
you cannot use it from the web app.

87
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.140
The web app has no API to do that.

88
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.950
So as a user, you click there and
there is the delete there.

89
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:07.750
So now I only have one, Max, as a valid
credential stored for this website.

90
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.520
So if I refresh,
I'm autologging in as Max.

91
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.718
Look at this, if you have in Chrome
only one account registered with

92
00:06:16.718 --> 00:06:23.482
Credential Managements API or manually in
that website, you don't get any selector.

93
00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:28.213
You automatically get logged in.

94
00:06:28.213 --> 00:06:32.512
So now every time I refresh,
I'm automatically logged

95
00:06:32.512 --> 00:06:37.369
in without anything that express
that there was an autologin.

96
00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:42.063
The only thing that expressed that
something has happened is this icon here.

97
00:06:42.063 --> 00:06:47.108
So if you see the key icon,
it's because there was

98
00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:52.649
a call to the credential manager,
okay, make sense?

99
00:06:55.898 --> 00:07:02.091
And that's all for credential management,
and indeed for this API.

100
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:05.061
Do you have any question?

101
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:08.040
&gt;&gt; Is that something that
can be turned off in Chrome?

102
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.407
&gt;&gt; As a user, you said?

103
00:07:09.407 --> 00:07:12.161
Yeah, you can turn off
the whole password manager.

104
00:07:12.161 --> 00:07:15.625
So then if you do that,
when you try to store a credential,

105
00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:19.540
you will get an exception because,
yeah, you don't have that.

106
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.222
&gt;&gt; Cuz I'm getting a positive for
Windows.passwordCredential

107
00:07:24.222 --> 00:07:24.940
&gt;&gt; Where?

108
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.472
&gt;&gt; But
navigator.credentials.get is not working.

109
00:07:27.472 --> 00:07:28.280
&gt;&gt; It's not working.

110
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.979
Well, that's maybe because
you have disabled.

111
00:07:30.979 --> 00:07:35.265
So I mean, you have the API,
so you can try it, but

112
00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:42.126
then you as a user have decided not to
have any password storage in your browser.

113
00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:46.143
So that means we should also check that.

114
00:07:46.143 --> 00:07:47.490
How to check that?

115
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.800
I'm using await.

116
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:55.854
So actually, let me search for
credentials.

117
00:07:55.854 --> 00:08:02.730
And we are postLogin,
where is it, postLogin, here.

118
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:12.596
Here, I should do try catch,
that how, That how you handle.

119
00:08:12.596 --> 00:08:14.092
I mean, can you do anything?

120
00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:19.425
No, more than updating the UI saying,
yeah, we couldn't save,

121
00:08:19.425 --> 00:08:24.394
or go to the browser and
go to settings, something like that.

122
00:08:24.394 --> 00:08:28.529
So more than giving user instructions,
there's nothing you can do about it.
