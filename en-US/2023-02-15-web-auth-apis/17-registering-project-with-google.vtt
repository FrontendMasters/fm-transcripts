WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.854
We are now here in Sign in
with Google in Chapter 4 and

2
00:00:03.854 --> 00:00:07.510
we will start registering the product,
okay?

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.842
And I'm pointing you here, because there
is a link here that you can follow,

4
00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:16.820
if not Google,
Sign in with Google setup, okay?

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.500
So what's idea?

6
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.099
Every time you're going to use this kind
of federated login, again you wanna let

7
00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.690
your users to login with other people's
accounts, with other websites accounts.

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.586
Google, Twitter, GitHub,
anyone you typically need to go and

9
00:00:34.586 --> 00:00:38.771
get an account with them as a web
developer if you need to get an account

10
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:43.470
with Google with Apple case of Apple,
you also need to pay them, okay?

11
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.356
But so in this case, if you go to
sign in with Google set up, okay?

12
00:00:49.356 --> 00:00:56.319
You go to this is the whole documentation,
it's a very large documentation, okay?

13
00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:00.118
But I will just point you to
the most important parts or

14
00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:03.900
the parts that I actually always needed.

15
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.084
For example,
there is a section here that says Setup,

16
00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:10.140
this is part of Google Identity,
Authentication.

17
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.207
You can see here that Authentication and

18
00:01:12.207 --> 00:01:14.790
Authorization is something different,
okay?

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.440
It's completely separate.

20
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.040
So we are in Authentication,
and let's go to Setup.

21
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.740
In Setup it says, well, first, what you
need is to get your Google API client ID.

22
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.390
I said, where can I get that?

23
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.320
Well, you will need a Google account.

24
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.140
So here you can sign in
with your Gmail account.

25
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.110
Are you great that Google account for
this?

26
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.303
It's up to you.

27
00:01:38.303 --> 00:01:44.164
So you click here where it
says Google API's console and

28
00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:50.411
you go to the Google Cloud API and
Services Console, okay?

29
00:01:50.411 --> 00:01:52.322
I already have a project for these but

30
00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.960
they will show you how
to create a new one.

31
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.528
Just so you can follow along and

32
00:01:56.528 --> 00:02:00.330
create your own project in
case you wanna implement this.

33
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.069
So one idea here, this is the place
where you can create projects that

34
00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.316
will use Google APIs,
any kind of Google APIs, Google Maps,

35
00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:13.748
Google Sheets, Google Drive,
any API that comes from Google.

36
00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:17.432
And we will use authentication
services from Google, okay?

37
00:02:17.432 --> 00:02:20.408
So you just need to be logged
in with a Google account,

38
00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:23.396
that's all,
in this case this is my Google account.

39
00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:27.115
So from here what you first need
to do is create a new project.

40
00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:31.585
In fact, the first time you get here if
you have never played with Google APIs,

41
00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:33.805
you don't have a project, okay?

42
00:02:33.805 --> 00:02:37.246
In this case, also you have for
free ten projects,

43
00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:40.355
I have seven remaining in my quota.

44
00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:44.645
All my projects are tests from courses,
at least the one in this account.

45
00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:49.740
So we gave this a project name, so
this is going to be my coffee masters.

46
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:58.610
It's internal, no one is going to see that
more than you, and you create it, okay?

47
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.150
So 30 seconds, and when it's done,
let's wait for that, yep.

48
00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.056
You select the project, so

49
00:03:08.056 --> 00:03:12.070
now this is a project that will
appear here in this drop down, okay?

50
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:19.265
Coffee master, okay, so once that's done,
we need to create a credential.

51
00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:25.124
But to create the credential,
we first need to create the metadata or

52
00:03:25.124 --> 00:03:29.175
set the metadata for
our OAuth consent screen.

53
00:03:30.265 --> 00:03:35.495
In short words, because from our website,
the user will see a pop-up or

54
00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:39.025
the user will be navigating
to a Google website.

55
00:03:39.025 --> 00:03:44.387
That Google website will have your name,
your icon, maybe the information

56
00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:49.640
about who are you, why are you
requesting logging in with Google?

57
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.120
And also you need to accept all the terms.

58
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.707
So that happens here in
the consent screen, okay?

59
00:03:56.707 --> 00:04:02.164
So here it says okay, which kind of
users will use your app, internal users?

60
00:04:02.164 --> 00:04:06.821
This is only if you have a Google for
apps workspace.

61
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.839
So if your company is every employee

62
00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.275
has a Google account under your domain or
external.

63
00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:16.060
In this case we will use external.

64
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.152
So we want Gmail users to
log in in our website.

65
00:04:20.152 --> 00:04:26.681
When you use external, before deploying
these, you will need to get approval.

66
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:31.853
So someone a person at Google will
actually check that you're a real app

67
00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:37.038
okay, that you're not he will make it,
I mean a simple check, right?

68
00:04:37.038 --> 00:04:41.171
But that you are not fake bank website or
something like that or

69
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:43.962
you don't look like that please, okay?

70
00:04:43.962 --> 00:04:49.045
But while you are working with this,
you can create test users up to 100.

71
00:04:49.045 --> 00:04:53.105
So then you don't need to wait for
approval to actually see these working.

72
00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:58.751
You can have your own Gmail, or
other people's Gmail account as testers,

73
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:03.588
so they will be able to login even
if you don't get approval, and

74
00:05:03.588 --> 00:05:07.729
it works with localhost which is great,
makes sense.

75
00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.755
So I'm going to say great and
now it's asking me for

76
00:05:11.755 --> 00:05:15.860
information that will
appear in that screen.

77
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.573
That again, is sometimes it's a pop up,

78
00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:23.050
on desktop it's a pop up unless
you have pop ups to disable.

79
00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.836
And in that case, it will just
navigate away from your current

80
00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:33.260
page in a new tab, and
that tab will come back to your tab later.

81
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.267
So here the app name, so CoffeeMasters,

82
00:05:37.267 --> 00:05:42.539
support email, okay,
I can take any email from here.

83
00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.903
The app logo is not mandatory, so
yeah, you can just keep it for now,

84
00:05:46.903 --> 00:05:48.569
you can upload your logo.

85
00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.830
By the way, we have a logo, so
in the project, we can upload a logo.

86
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.862
So it's in images, Icons, IcoPNG,

87
00:05:57.862 --> 00:06:02.470
there is also a logo that I can use.

88
00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:06.322
So if you wanna add more
information about your page, but

89
00:06:06.322 --> 00:06:12.197
this is completely optional, and this is
important, you can add authorized domain.

90
00:06:12.197 --> 00:06:18.120
So for this to work, I need to add
here the domains that are authorized,

91
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.980
so in case,
I will put this in coffeemaster.com, okay?

92
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.120
I will do that but
also I can say localhost, okay?

93
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.320
As an authorized domain, but
if you look here, he says no,

94
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.490
it must be a top private domain.

95
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.581
So actually localhost is not
here where I need to put I

96
00:06:36.581 --> 00:06:39.360
will need to add localhost but not here.

97
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.920
This is for public domains actually.

98
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.420
Developer contact,
you can contact mc.om that doesn't exist.

99
00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.421
Okay, this is actually
a public email address,

100
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:57.885
I'm not going to publish
this with this data anyway.

101
00:06:57.885 --> 00:07:00.865
Scopes, we can completely ignore this for
now.

102
00:07:00.865 --> 00:07:06.803
Scopes is a way that we have in this
Google system to actually make different

103
00:07:06.803 --> 00:07:13.307
users to have different permissions over
my quotas, like I can have my account and

104
00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:18.984
have permission to add the credit card and
the billing system and blah.

105
00:07:18.984 --> 00:07:24.140
So I don't need this, so
I will just to save and continue.

106
00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:27.418
Here I can add my test users, okay, so

107
00:07:27.418 --> 00:07:32.334
here I can add all the test users
that I want to add here, so

108
00:07:32.334 --> 00:07:38.070
any email address okay,
it has to be a Google address, okay?

109
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:45.090
Will work like I have Frontend Masters
of Gmail, so I can add that one, okay?

110
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:49.300
And I can add up to 100, okay?

111
00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:55.238
I will add also my primary one and
those are going to be testing users.

112
00:07:55.238 --> 00:08:02.315
Remember with this,
you don't need then to be approved, okay?

113
00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:07.094
And now this is how it's going to
look like, so now that part is ready,

114
00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:10.508
we can create credentials
that's the last part.

115
00:08:10.508 --> 00:08:16.170
So in this case we are going to create
credentials for and OAuth ClientID.

116
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.590
And we are kind of finishing here right
now, so at the top I'm going to create

117
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.430
the credential and
I'm going to create one of those.

118
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.510
What application type?

119
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.312
It's a web application.

120
00:08:29.312 --> 00:08:34.445
So the name it just internal so
this is I know the PWA wherever,

121
00:08:34.445 --> 00:08:40.075
and here we need to add the JavaScript
origins that are available and

122
00:08:40.075 --> 00:08:46.039
here we are going to call for
example our localhost 50, 50, okay?

123
00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:53.080
For example, and in case later
we use localhost without a port.

124
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.189
We can as many as we want, okay?

125
00:08:56.189 --> 00:09:00.965
And for now, I think that's enough, and

126
00:09:00.965 --> 00:09:08.220
now we have these two things,
a client ID and my client secret.

127
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:14.030
This is like a public private key set,
okay?

128
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.300
So we will need to get
the client ID somewhere.

129
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:22.280
I will explain where in a minute,
but those are the first steps, okay?

130
00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:29.402
Now we are ready to implement this in
our website, the good news is that so

131
00:09:29.402 --> 00:09:35.230
far it was a lot of work but implementing
this is actually pretty straightforward.

132
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:39.260
You will see I will just copy and paste
something and it will magically work now.

133
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.983
That's because Google created like
a library to make it work easily but

134
00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:48.472
if you're implementing this over GitHub or
other providers well,

135
00:09:48.472 --> 00:09:52.743
you need to do it manually and
yeah it will require a lot of steps.
