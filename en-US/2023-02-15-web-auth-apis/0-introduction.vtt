1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.563
So welcome to Fullstack Authentication.

2
00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:08.454
My name is Maximiliano Firtman,
F-I-R-T on Twitter, firt.dev, my website.

3
00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:11.763
And we're going to spend the whole
day doing a fullstack project.

4
00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:15.531
So we're going to see how to
do authentication these days.

5
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:20.448
So we're going to start from scratch,
creating a classic login form and

6
00:00:20.448 --> 00:00:22.311
see how we can do it better.

7
00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:26.421
And then we're going to end
up working with passwordless

8
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:29.428
authentication with Face ID, Touch ID.

9
00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:32.670
We're going to see how
that works on the web.

10
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.961
So I'm a mobile web developer.

11
00:00:34.961 --> 00:00:37.672
I've been doing web development for
a while.

12
00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:40.207
I'm from Argentina, by the way.

13
00:00:40.207 --> 00:00:44.140
So I've been doing JavaScript and
progressive web apps for a while now.

14
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.607
So HTML since 1996, so long time ago.

15
00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:51.446
The same as JavaScript and
web apps in general, and

16
00:00:51.446 --> 00:00:56.190
also I've been a back end developer
in the days of classic ASP.

17
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.720
Even before that, Pearl, not sure if
anyone remembers that, but also PHP,

18
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.502
.NET, Java, Python, and
everything that you can count there.

19
00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:10.814
I authored 13 books,
typically on web, mobile,

20
00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:15.813
web performance, and
more than 150 web apps in general.

21
00:01:15.813 --> 00:01:21.241
So I've been implementing login
mechanism for a while as well.

22
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:27.230
So let's start and jump directly
into our topic, authentication.

23
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.827
So today we will cover these ideas.

24
00:01:29.827 --> 00:01:33.001
First, what authentication is?

25
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.177
But actually, why it's important,

26
00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:39.877
I think that most of us understand the
basics of why authentication is important.

27
00:01:39.877 --> 00:01:43.616
We wanna identify users and
we wanna make sure that is the user and

28
00:01:43.616 --> 00:01:45.845
not someone impersonating the user.

29
00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:48.644
From that basic idea to other things like,

30
00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:53.241
what's the difference between
authentication and authorization?

31
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:55.151
That is not actually the same thing.

32
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:57.496
So we're going to talk about
the state of techniques.

33
00:01:57.496 --> 00:02:02.343
So where we are right now in
terms of the evolution of

34
00:02:02.343 --> 00:02:06.641
how we want to authenticate
users on the web.

35
00:02:06.641 --> 00:02:09.662
We're going to start with login forms,
because they're still there.

36
00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:14.105
So we will cover the basics in case you
are starting with the web, maybe you

37
00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:18.994
are a recent full stack developer and
you wanna implement your own login system.

38
00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:24.585
Well, we're going to start with
the basics of the forms, but we're going

39
00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:30.830
to see also new authentication flows that
are part of today's design guidelines.

40
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.109
And on that side, we're going to
talk about the data structure.

41
00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.107
So how you should structure your database,
for example, or object-based databases,

42
00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:39.316
it doesn't matter.

43
00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:42.724
So we're going to see how
that structure looks like.

44
00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:45.578
Then we're going to also create some APIs.

45
00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:52.010
So the endpoints, server side, the
RESTful APIs to actually make that work.

46
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.131
In terms of APIs, we're going to
see credential management API,

47
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:59.296
web authentication,
also known as WebAuthn, and

48
00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:02.547
we're going to talk about passkeys and
passlinks.

49
00:03:02.547 --> 00:03:06.963
So we're going to talk about
those new ideas that are,

50
00:03:06.963 --> 00:03:11.386
let's say coming, but
they are kind of there, okay?

51
00:03:11.386 --> 00:03:13.753
So we will get there with time.

52
00:03:13.753 --> 00:03:15.040
So pre-requisites.

53
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.540
So I'm going to write JavaScript, HTML.

54
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.924
So if you know HTML and
JavaScript, you're good.

55
00:03:20.924 --> 00:03:22.930
I'm going to use Node.js for the backend.

56
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.618
So having some experience
in Node.js helps.

57
00:03:26.618 --> 00:03:29.639
If you don't have experience with Node.js,
It's okay.

58
00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.957
You will understand the JavaScript
code anyway, it's not is a big deal.

59
00:03:33.957 --> 00:03:37.706
And at firtman.github.io/authentication,

60
00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:43.503
you have a step on step guideline of
everything that we're going to do today,

61
00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:48.852
including the links for these slides,
in case you wanna follow along,

62
00:03:48.852 --> 00:03:52.806
and also the link for
the repo that we will use later.

63
00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:57.512
So I will give you that link again later,
if not, it's in the instructions, okay?

64
00:03:57.512 --> 00:03:59.955
So, that repo, we're not going
to start 100% from scratch.

65
00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:03.883
So I already have the HTML, the CSS,
so we don't spend time on that and

66
00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:07.630
we spend time on the important part for
us, that is authentication
