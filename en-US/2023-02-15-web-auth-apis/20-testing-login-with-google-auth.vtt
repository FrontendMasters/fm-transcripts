00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.260
So trying this now, let's try this on

2
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.655
different browsers such as Safari.

3
00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:13.557
Just to show you that not
because I'm using Google,

4
00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:17.724
everything can be Googled,
Google thing look at this,

5
00:00:17.724 --> 00:00:23.410
this is Safari, you can see the UI
is different than on Chrome.

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.070
Okay, so it's trying to do what it can,
so use your Google account, I mean,

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.814
it's aggressive, right?

8
00:00:29.814 --> 00:00:33.278
Because it's not like you are seeing
I mean, if I go into login,

9
00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:35.344
I still see the normal button, okay?

10
00:00:35.344 --> 00:00:40.302
But anyway, on page load, there is
that dialogue, if you don't like it,

11
00:00:40.302 --> 00:00:43.765
well, we just need to untick
some of these options or

12
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:46.540
disable some of the options from the div.

13
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.891
Okay, so then it will work only if the
user clicks here, if the user clicks here,

14
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.200
okay, I'm receiving this, so
I can use it in another account.

15
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.620
I can login with for
example, Frontend Masters,

16
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.650
let me see if I remember the password,
by the way.

17
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.973
The auth@gmail I think,

18
00:01:05.973 --> 00:01:10.805
no, I don't remember the password,

19
00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:16.720
look at that, okay, forgot the password?

20
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.504
No, anyway, so, you can see that
everything that happens here,

21
00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:27.400
happens actually, in a new pop-up.

22
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.750
And then when you're done, you go back
here, you go back to the homepage.

23
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.790
Okay, so that's how you do federated
logins, there are more steps involved.

24
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:46.023
First, you need to typically register,
get a key, get the code, get the URL.

25
00:01:46.023 --> 00:01:49.437
If you're implementing
this manually with OAuth,

26
00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:54.870
it's even more low level, and you also
need to do a lot of stuff on your server.

27
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.507
Because here we're using
a client side library,

28
00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:03.734
it's much simpler, okay?

29
00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:08.977
You have any question so far on this?

30
00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:18.636
Remember these arrows are, so
now you can see that it's syncing me

31
00:02:18.636 --> 00:02:23.346
automatically every time I'm
reloading I have double or login.

32
00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:27.692
It's been logging automatically by
credential management and also by Google.

33
00:02:27.692 --> 00:02:35.924
And I'm getting an error that they should
solve in API 14, so let me go there.

34
00:02:35.924 --> 00:02:39.922
That says that I don't have
the user because it's not the user,

35
00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:41.635
it's data, that's why.

36
00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:47.960
So I had a problem here in logging from
Google, the argument is called data.

37
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.366
But we need to solve that problem because,
hey,

38
00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:53.959
we have here two logins at the same time,
which doesn't make any sense.

39
00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.138
So if the user is logging in with Google,
we shouldn't use the same

40
00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:05.440
thing on credential management, of course
I can delete my credential manager.

41
00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:13.340
So I won't have another order log in
right now, only the Google one, okay?

42
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.363
Make sense?

43
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.693
Okay, it seem like there is
an error in the server, so

44
00:03:19.693 --> 00:03:22.730
we have a couple of error
that we need to solve.

45
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.380
Let's read, understand what's
going on our object, okay?

46
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.440
We got JWT that is the code of the string.

47
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.133
Then the string is coming from an object
known as credential that we are sending

48
00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:41.400
from the client and the Google object
has another credential inside and

49
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.580
that's the string that we need to decode.

50
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.590
When we decode that we get a JWT object.

51
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.770
In that object, we have a payload.

52
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.640
In that payload we have all the data,
that's how it works.

53
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.290
By the way, the payload,
it's not actually in Google's response.

54
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.910
Payload is how this
library returns the data.

55
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.720
So the JWT library returns the data in
.payload and then wherever you are seeing.

56
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.930
For example, here I have a problem that
is not payload.AOID, it's JWT.payload.

57
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.300
And the same here, jwt.payload,
those were my bugs at this point.

58
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.452
So with that,
now every time we log in with Google,

59
00:04:30.452 --> 00:04:35.832
we will create a new object in our oath,
JSON database,

60
00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:40.880
and in this case the object
will be different.

61
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.198
So when you are back into your web app,

62
00:04:44.198 --> 00:04:49.488
we may have a problem here that
we should solve the bag that had

63
00:04:49.488 --> 00:04:55.390
to do with auto login because
I needed to get credentials.

64
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.944
So because I deleted the credentials,
I'm not checking what happens when you get

65
00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:03.530
the credential,
if you're getting undefined as a result.

66
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.416
So I'm trying to get the ID and

67
00:05:06.416 --> 00:05:11.612
the password of a credential
that doesn't exist, so

68
00:05:11.612 --> 00:05:17.507
we can solve that error line 64,
so of .JS line 64 here.

69
00:05:17.507 --> 00:05:20.691
So I should check if we
do have credentials,

70
00:05:20.691 --> 00:05:25.685
because if we don't have credentials
I shouldn't be auto-logging

71
00:05:25.685 --> 00:05:30.270
the user because that user
has deleted the credentials.

72
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.510
That's kind of the idea on that error and

73
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:39.150
now when you refresh because I'm
auto-logging with Google, okay?

74
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:44.151
You will see your Gmail username
directly here that I didn't

75
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:49.600
create an account with that
email in my project, okay?

76
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.627
And finally,
if we go to our database of the JSON,

77
00:05:54.627 --> 00:06:02.436
we are going to see our new feather
writer object with the Google identifier.

78
00:06:04.702 --> 00:06:06.170
Okay, make sense?

79
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:10.735
And to be honest here also you
have other things to consider

80
00:06:10.735 --> 00:06:14.200
about how do you identify your user.

81
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.630
You can identify your user by its email,
and you trust Google that,

82
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.604
that's the user's email, or you can
identify the Google user by its AU ID,

83
00:06:23.604 --> 00:06:27.130
that's internal ID, it's up to you.

84
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.721
So I think that in most situations,
trusting the email address is okay.

85
00:06:33.721 --> 00:06:36.023
Okay, we trust that Google,

86
00:06:36.023 --> 00:06:41.097
if Google is giving me that email
address it shouldn't be false.

87
00:06:41.097 --> 00:06:46.826
Okay, the only situations where this
might be a problem is what happens?

88
00:06:46.826 --> 00:06:52.621
Because we need to remember
that the information

89
00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:58.143
from Google is coming
with a network request.

90
00:06:58.143 --> 00:07:03.573
I can even open the network tab and
see everything that happens here, okay?

91
00:07:03.573 --> 00:07:07.756
So I will see the answer from Google,
okay,

92
00:07:07.756 --> 00:07:12.292
so what happens if I have
a plugin in my browser.

93
00:07:12.292 --> 00:07:15.215
So that is changing the email address,

94
00:07:15.215 --> 00:07:19.025
is faking the email address
coming from Google, or

95
00:07:19.025 --> 00:07:24.800
some weird JavaScript code or is doing
that well as it should do for homework.

96
00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.531
Actually, Google has a solution for
that is that you can make an API

97
00:07:31.531 --> 00:07:37.925
call server side to Google to confirm
that, that AU ID belongs to that email.

98
00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:39.031
Make sense?

99
00:07:39.031 --> 00:07:43.540
Just in case some man in
the middle has changed the email.

100
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:47.164
And then you're trusting an email
that is not the right one.

101
00:07:47.164 --> 00:07:52.911
Before moving on to the next topic,
I think it's important for

102
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:57.850
us to now disable this
auto login from Google.

103
00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.296
And also the ITP support,
at least temporarily.

104
00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:06.081
Because if not, every time,
we are refreshing the page, we are auto

105
00:08:06.081 --> 00:08:10.966
login with Google and that will be
a problem for what we need to do next.

106
00:08:10.966 --> 00:08:15.083
That is trying to understand how to log
in the user in better ways using web

107
00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:17.220
authentication, okay?

108
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.490
So I'm just going to remove that, so then
if you wanna log in with Google it's fine.

109
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.703
By the way, my server is down.

110
00:08:25.703 --> 00:08:30.836
So probably we don't need to show that,
so now if I refresh,

111
00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:36.470
I mean if, I wanna log in,
I need to explicitly say so.

112
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:39.289
If not, it's still there, okay?

113
00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:44.380
Just by changing those true with
false in the d, make sense?

114
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.655
In fact, if you don't like that dialogue,

115
00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:52.535
you can also take that dialogue out and
just keep only the button.
