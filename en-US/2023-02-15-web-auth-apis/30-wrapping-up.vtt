1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.892
So we started with the idea
of authentication and

2
00:00:02.892 --> 00:00:05.320
the state of techniques where we are,
okay?

3
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.062
So we cover this idea of username and
password,

4
00:00:09.062 --> 00:00:13.284
on top of that multi-factor
authentication, credential management,

5
00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:18.070
federated logins such as signing with
logging, web authentication, pass keys.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.648
We created a login form,
see how we can enhance that login form

7
00:00:24.648 --> 00:00:31.186
to work with today's password managers and
also some accessibility things,

8
00:00:31.186 --> 00:00:35.543
these new flows that we need
to implement right now,

9
00:00:35.543 --> 00:00:39.130
such as the identification first flow.

10
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.486
So we first ask for
any identification, and

11
00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:46.100
then we see how can we identify the user.

12
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.675
We created the server with a simple
data structure in JSON, and

13
00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.520
all the web services.

14
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.740
And we cover most of the API
available in web authentication.

15
00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.816
There are some advanced tips to understand
and all the cryptographic part and

16
00:01:00.816 --> 00:01:05.578
all the possibilities, all the filters
where you can pick how do you want

17
00:01:05.578 --> 00:01:09.195
the data or
how do you wanna select the authenticator.

18
00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:15.984
But as you can see, the code that we have
created is covering most of the use cases.

19
00:01:15.984 --> 00:01:21.439
And then, we cover this mix between
passkeys and magic links that some

20
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:28.040
people are saying passlinks as a way to
have a passwordless world in the future.

21
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.652
That's all I have.

22
00:01:28.652 --> 00:01:32.131
