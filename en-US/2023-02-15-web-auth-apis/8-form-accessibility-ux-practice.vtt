WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.234
Now we are ready to
start playing with this.

2
00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:06.558
The first thing that we will
be doing is increasing the,

3
00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:11.349
let's say the usability and
the accessibility of the forms.

4
00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.133
Because right now my forms are really bad.

5
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.881
Okay, at that.

6
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:20.635
And so, if you have a form in your website
or in a web app today, please go and

7
00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:24.808
check everything that they're
going to check right now, okay?

8
00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:29.829
Again, maybe most of you, some of you
already know how to do a form, but

9
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:35.557
this part, like enhancing the form for
password managers might not be the case.

10
00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:40.059
First, if you look here,
my password has a label, that's a label.

11
00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.927
So a label is a text that is visible,

12
00:00:42.927 --> 00:00:48.294
that it's not inside the text control,
it's actually outside.

13
00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:52.198
The email doesn't have that.

14
00:00:52.198 --> 00:00:54.672
The email has a placeholder.

15
00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:58.710
A placeholder is that text that
appears until I write something.

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.327
Well, that's wrong.

17
00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:05.150
You can actually see that when you
are registering the account, for

18
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.110
example, it says your name so you can say
Max, your email, blah, blah, blah, blah,

19
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.147
blah, blah blah blah blah, blah.

20
00:01:12.147 --> 00:01:17.661
The problem with this is that after
a while, apparently it happened to you,

21
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:21.969
I'm pretty sure,
you go back before submitting the form,

22
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.640
hopefully if there are more fields,

23
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.833
before submitted the form you wanna
double check the details, right?

24
00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:35.324
And you go here and says, what's this
name and email or email or name.

25
00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:37.409
And now you don't remember.

26
00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.905
So, what you're doing is
you're deleting the data,

27
00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:47.098
you're cutting to check,
do double-check, so this is bad.

28
00:01:47.098 --> 00:01:48.033
We don't want that.

29
00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.319
We always need a visible label, okay?

30
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.312
And not just the label, so
let's start with register, for example.

31
00:01:56.312 --> 00:01:59.901
So, I have a field set,
this is an HTML element.

32
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.177
That says here your name,
but it has a typo also, but

33
00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:06.085
I don't want a placeholder actually, okay?

34
00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:11.677
It has a require, so it has some semantics
from HTML, but I need a label, okay?

35
00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:17.321
So, I'm going to create a label,
a tag label that will say here, Your Name.

36
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:20.805
And the same for your email,
that's a label tag.

37
00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:26.389
But the label tag shouldn't be alone
like in this case, do you know

38
00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:31.593
what to do from an accessibility
point of view with the label?

39
00:02:31.593 --> 00:02:35.012
Does anyone know what's missing here
&gt;&gt; Look for.

40
00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:39.973
&gt;&gt; the for, there is a for
attribute where we should

41
00:02:39.973 --> 00:02:44.934
connect the input ID in
this case register name,

42
00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:48.087
and the same for this is email.

43
00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:49.791
So why?

44
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:55.707
Because that will increase
UX accessibility first,

45
00:02:55.707 --> 00:03:00.937
screen readers for example,
because on screen reader will

46
00:03:00.937 --> 00:03:06.385
don't know that this input is
related to the previous label.

47
00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:10.473
Okay, and screen reader is for
people with visual disabilities or

48
00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:15.081
different abilities and in that case
they won't know, so we need the for.

49
00:03:15.081 --> 00:03:20.439
And from a UX perspective or
usability perspective it will also help

50
00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.805
because if you click in the label
it will focus that element as well.

51
00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:30.434
And that's useful for mobile devices.

52
00:03:30.434 --> 00:03:33.450
I don't know about you, but
my finger have fat fingers.

53
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.432
So actually to tap over the little
input type sometimes is not so simple.

54
00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:44.983
So, you just tap somewhere and
most of the time that's the label.

55
00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:48.838
It's always a good idea to have
a label as a display block.

56
00:03:48.838 --> 00:03:53.617
If you do that, the display,
let's say, clickable area is larger,

57
00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:55.245
it's the whole block.

58
00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:59.533
Even if it has padding,
it's better to have padding and

59
00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:04.016
margins that will increase
the tapable area of the label.

60
00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:08.545
If you keep the label is by default in
line, so it's going to be just the word or

61
00:04:08.545 --> 00:04:11.350
the words that you're using the label,
okay?

62
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.249
But again, for
usability on mobile devices is much bad to

63
00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:21.263
have a display block element
with paddings, make sense?

64
00:04:21.263 --> 00:04:24.092
Not margins.

65
00:04:24.092 --> 00:04:29.381
Okay, so, I have that, but
I need to also use the for

66
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.521
on here to register password.

67
00:04:35.173 --> 00:04:36.834
Okay, like so.

68
00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:44.971
And then, the other thing that I need
to add is the auto-complete values.

69
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:47.178
So, for the name, it gonna be named.

70
00:04:47.178 --> 00:04:52.478
You can see here that we have so
many possibilities.

71
00:04:52.478 --> 00:04:54.702
For the email, should I use email?

72
00:04:54.702 --> 00:04:55.775
No.

73
00:04:55.775 --> 00:04:59.104
Because in our case,
it's going to be the username.

74
00:04:59.104 --> 00:05:02.497
So, for the autocomplete,
it goes username.

75
00:05:02.497 --> 00:05:05.690
If you have a different username and
an email, well, that's okay.

76
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.403
You can use autocomplete email,
but in this case that will help.

77
00:05:11.403 --> 00:05:17.124
It will help password managers, okay.

78
00:05:17.124 --> 00:05:22.597
And for the password,
they are complete is not password

79
00:05:22.597 --> 00:05:28.071
is new password because this
is the registration form,

80
00:05:28.071 --> 00:05:32.153
okay, so, new passwords, make sense?

81
00:05:32.153 --> 00:05:37.261
And you will see quickly if
you have a password manager,

82
00:05:37.261 --> 00:05:43.673
you will see a difference,
that now when you are inside that element,

83
00:05:43.673 --> 00:05:50.210
the browser will suggest you a password
if you have a password manager.

84
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.267
Password managers are optional these days.

85
00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:56.543
Even in Google Chrome you can
disable password managers.

86
00:05:56.543 --> 00:06:00.527
So, it's not like everyone
has a password manager, but

87
00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:06.088
if you do have a password manager being
the browser internal password manager or

88
00:06:06.088 --> 00:06:08.008
a new one, that will help.

89
00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:12.746
And for the login, we need to do something
similar, so there is a whole section.

90
00:06:12.746 --> 00:06:16.566
So here this is the section class page,
ID register, and

91
00:06:16.566 --> 00:06:19.204
here I have another section for login.

92
00:06:19.204 --> 00:06:24.086
So I just need to add a label for
the username,

93
00:06:24.086 --> 00:06:29.740
that is actually the email,
okay, and the label for

94
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:36.207
login email, And the one for
the password was already there.

95
00:06:36.207 --> 00:06:43.475
The only thing that I need to add is
the autocomplete Username on the email.

96
00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:50.872
And current password for
a complete because we are in a login,

97
00:06:50.872 --> 00:06:53.385
we don't want a new password,

98
00:06:53.385 --> 00:06:58.723
we don't want the password manager
to suggest me a new password.

99
00:06:58.723 --> 00:07:03.388
I want to use a saved password, okay?

100
00:07:03.388 --> 00:07:03.888
Make sense?

101
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:11.500
So, those are my My file.

102
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.483
So if I refresh now, I'm getting
that that's the current register.

103
00:07:16.483 --> 00:07:21.334
You can see that if I'm in
Chrome in this case, if I click,

104
00:07:21.334 --> 00:07:27.571
if I focus in the password, it has that
suggest a strong password option and

105
00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:32.239
that's because I added this
autocomplete attribute.

106
00:07:32.239 --> 00:07:37.112
So then, because it's the first
time in this Chrome instance that

107
00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:40.866
I'm doing this, it says,
do you wanna save this?

108
00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:42.524
I can save this here.

109
00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:50.531
And the login form is also now,

110
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:58.669
Working because it's suggesting me to
take password from my Google account.

111
00:07:58.669 --> 00:07:59.380
Makes sense?

112
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.625
And if I try in Safari, for example,
you will see here that icon there

113
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:09.516
that lets you select a password
if I'm registering a password.

114
00:08:09.516 --> 00:08:12.794
Okay, I think from here you
can suggest a new password.

115
00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.111
So, for example in this case that this
is not working, if I click here and

116
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:26.300
nothing happens, okay, what it's
asking me for a name and an email.

117
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.282
But if I click here, it's not ready yet
so nothing is happening.

118
00:08:29.282 --> 00:08:33.163
So, is it saving the password?

119
00:08:33.163 --> 00:08:35.785
Well, I need to submit first somehow.

120
00:08:35.785 --> 00:08:38.106
And how the browser knows
that I'm submitting?

121
00:08:38.106 --> 00:08:41.512
It can be like a form submit,
classic submit, or

122
00:08:41.512 --> 00:08:44.926
it can be a single page
application submission.

123
00:08:44.926 --> 00:08:49.231
In that case,
you have to change the URL with push take.

124
00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:51.522
So, you have to change the route.
