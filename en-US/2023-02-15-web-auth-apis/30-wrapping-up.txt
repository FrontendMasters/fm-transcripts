>> So we started with the idea of authentication and the state of techniques where we are, okay? So we cover this idea of username and password, on top of that multi-factor authentication, credential management, federated logins such as signing with logging, web authentication, pass keys. We created a login form, see how we can enhance that login form to work with today's password managers and also some accessibility things, these new flows that we need to implement right now, such as the identification first flow.

[00:00:39]
So we first ask for any identification, and then we see how can we identify the user. We created the server with a simple data structure in JSON, and all the web services. And we cover most of the API available in web authentication. There are some advanced tips to understand and all the cryptographic part and all the possibilities, all the filters where you can pick how do you want the data or how do you wanna select the authenticator.

[00:01:09]
But as you can see, the code that we have created is covering most of the use cases. And then, we cover this mix between passkeys and magic links that some people are saying passlinks as a way to have a passwordless world in the future. That's all I have.
