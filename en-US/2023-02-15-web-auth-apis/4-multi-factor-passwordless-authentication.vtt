1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.012
So then to one of the solutions that
appear with time to solve the problem is

2
00:00:04.012 --> 00:00:05.900
multi-factor authentication.

3
00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.990
It started with two factor but
then multi-factor.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.342
So in this case,
it's actually the same thing.

5
00:00:11.342 --> 00:00:15.080
So we send the password, okay?

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.699
But as we know the password
is not secure enough,

7
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.710
we add another authentication factor.

8
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.137
It can be an email address, so

9
00:00:24.137 --> 00:00:29.282
I send you a code through email
after you give me your password,

10
00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:34.717
so then I will check, okay, so
it's the password that you know but

11
00:00:34.717 --> 00:00:40.576
also something that you should have
like access to your email account.

12
00:00:40.576 --> 00:00:44.768
Or your SMS or a USB key like a YubiKey or

13
00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:49.230
where you can store there are some data.

14
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.317
So all of these are multi factor
authentication in that case,

15
00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:55.681
you will generate the code, okay?

16
00:00:55.681 --> 00:01:00.649
Apart from the secret password,
and that code will also

17
00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.202
travel to the server to increase security,
okay?

18
00:01:05.202 --> 00:01:06.750
But it's not perfect.

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.220
It's still not perfect.

20
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.579
I mean, for example,
I'm not going to say which company but, so

21
00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.649
I have a SIM card, so I'm from Argentina,
so my SIM card is from Argentina,

22
00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.640
from an Argentinian company,
but I also have a US SIM card.

23
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.263
And one day I lost that SIM card,
it didn't work anymore, so

24
00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:28.480
I went to an office and I got a new one.

25
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.775
They didn't ask me for anything, not
even my passport, just the phone number.

26
00:01:33.775 --> 00:01:36.817
So I gave them my phone number and
they gave me a SIM card.

27
00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:41.500
So if I could do that, yeah, I was
the owner but they didn't check that.

28
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.805
Anyone can do that.

29
00:01:42.805 --> 00:01:46.590
So they can easily get your SIM card and

30
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.332
then they will get your
SMS code instead of you.

31
00:01:51.332 --> 00:01:55.450
And there a lot of now scams
over WhatsApp also to do that.

32
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.490
So, it's complicated, but
maybe, they're calling you.

33
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.638
So if you pick up the call,

34
00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:06.918
when they're calling you because
you have the phone line used,

35
00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:11.441
they are sending you a WhatsApp code,
by call as well.

36
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.383
But because you are using the phone line,

37
00:02:15.383 --> 00:02:20.460
that code goes to your mailbox,
your phone mailbox.

38
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.248
So then someone get into your mailbox and
get the code.

39
00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:27.713
And with that weird situation,
they're stealing your WhatsApp.

40
00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:32.151
And when they do that they send messages
to your friends asking for money or

41
00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.955
something like that, okay?

42
00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:38.159
Anyway, weird situations happen,
so it is still not perfect.

43
00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.681
And the worst part is that it's adding
a lot of friction in the user experience.

44
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:47.624
Because you log in and then you
need to find your, where is my key,

45
00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:51.370
my USB key because,
I need to open my authenticator app.

46
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.307
Look for my code, okay?

47
00:02:53.307 --> 00:02:57.081
And it's adding friction
to the login experience.

48
00:02:57.081 --> 00:03:00.925
So user experience becomes a problem and
the risk is still there.

49
00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:04.912
So that's why we are arriving
to a passwordless experience.

50
00:03:04.912 --> 00:03:08.810
With password less secure
experience at least.

51
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.638
What we're going to do is
we're going to have a pair of,

52
00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:17.998
public and private key, okay?

53
00:03:17.998 --> 00:03:23.325
The private key will be stored
safely within your device, okay?

54
00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:27.463
It's not something that you know,
so, it's a secret, but

55
00:03:27.463 --> 00:03:31.857
it's not something that you will
write down in a piece of paper.

56
00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:36.895
You could actually as you can write
down the private address of your crypto

57
00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:41.947
wallet but, yeah, it's not common,
no one's going to do that, okay?

58
00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:47.231
So you use a USB key for that,
or modern devices can actually

59
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:53.590
encrypt the data with your fingerprint or
with your face recognition.

60
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.103
But it's not 100% secure.

61
00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:59.396
For example, with face ID, so

62
00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:04.719
there are one every
10,000 people that will

63
00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:10.307
actually log in in your
phone with a different face.

64
00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:13.392
The problem is finding that person, okay?

65
00:04:13.392 --> 00:04:14.489
So it's not so simple.

66
00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.471
Finding the person that it's actually so

67
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:22.251
similar to your face that can
actually log in your into your phone.

68
00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:25.680
So it's still considered already secure,
okay?

69
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.765
So, well, in that case,
that private key will be stored in

70
00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:35.871
your device encrypted by your
fingerprint or by your face.

71
00:04:35.871 --> 00:04:40.292
And the public key will actually travel to

72
00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:44.851
the web server and to the database, okay?

73
00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:48.503
That's how typically passwordless work.

74
00:04:48.503 --> 00:04:53.234
And yeah,
what happens now on different situations

75
00:04:53.234 --> 00:04:57.965
such as if an attacker gets
access to your server they

76
00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:02.909
will get your public key that is public so
yeah, okay,

77
00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:07.772
go ahead, take my public key,
nothing will happen.

78
00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:10.385
You cannot login with the public key.

79
00:05:10.385 --> 00:05:13.022
You need the private key,
not the public key.

80
00:05:13.022 --> 00:05:17.338
And also because the user actually
doesn't know the private key,

81
00:05:17.338 --> 00:05:19.740
they cannot get to link on the phone.

82
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.480
I cannot give the private
key on the phone.

83
00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.246
Or if I go to a phishing website, so here,

84
00:05:26.246 --> 00:05:31.737
we don't see the whole encryption
details in this diagram,

85
00:05:31.737 --> 00:05:38.306
but the private key is stored with
your fingerprint, with your face, or

86
00:05:38.306 --> 00:05:44.255
with the USB key, and
also with the origin of the website, okay?

87
00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:49.897
So, that private key won't be
taken out of the secure storage

88
00:05:49.897 --> 00:05:55.336
if you're in a different origin,
in a different website.

89
00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:58.244
So with phishing doesn't work with this,

90
00:05:58.244 --> 00:06:02.038
because when you go to a website
that is a different URL,

91
00:06:02.038 --> 00:06:07.483
the browser will not give that website
the credential, the store credential.

92
00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:08.990
Even if it's the same user.

93
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.248
Even if the user is using the finger or
pointing the face, it's not gonna work

94
00:06:13.248 --> 00:06:17.128
because [INAUDIBLE] says, no,
I'm sorry, that's not the website.

95
00:06:17.128 --> 00:06:22.353
So the credentials that we
created were for paypal.com not

96
00:06:22.353 --> 00:06:27.277
with paypaI, with instead of an L and
capital I, okay?

97
00:06:27.277 --> 00:06:30.809
So it will say, no, I don't have
credentials for their website.

98
00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:35.797
So this is not 100% secure, but

99
00:06:35.797 --> 00:06:42.790
much more secure than the previous flaws,
okay?

100
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.082
Make sense?

101
00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:44.768
Do you have any question?

102
00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:52.640
Is this available on the web today?

103
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.533
Yes.

104
00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:58.649
We are still not in the position
that everyone is using it.

105
00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:02.534
In fact, think about yourself as a user.

106
00:07:02.534 --> 00:07:10.142
In how many websites are you logging
in with Face ID or Touch ID or USB key?

107
00:07:10.142 --> 00:07:11.613
Probably not a lot.

108
00:07:11.613 --> 00:07:14.964
Unless you are in a high
security environment,

109
00:07:14.964 --> 00:07:19.152
like you are managing the accounting
on a large company, so

110
00:07:19.152 --> 00:07:24.012
actually you have access to
the bank account with $100 million,

111
00:07:24.012 --> 00:07:27.905
so accessing to that website
is really high security.

112
00:07:27.905 --> 00:07:33.767
So typically you have a USB key, and
maybe that USB key needs your fingerprint.

113
00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:38.154
But if it's just a website for
gaming or something like that, okay?

114
00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:41.789
You're not logging in
with these technologies.

115
00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:48.657
But it's time to start moving to these
technologies because they are there.

116
00:07:48.657 --> 00:07:55.561
From a user experience point of view,
they are actually easy to use.

117
00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:57.004
We will see that later.
