WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.307
This is the current options
that we have these days, okay,

2
00:00:04.307 --> 00:00:06.821
different kind of authentication.

3
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:13.600
At the bottom, we see more red, that's
less secure, at the top is more secure.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.280
And of course, less websites
are actually using the top right now.

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.590
So we started with a form-based
authentication at the bottom.

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.123
So every website is supporting this, okay?

7
00:00:26.123 --> 00:00:28.971
Then some websites on top of that,

8
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:33.820
they are increasing security
by adding multi-factors.

9
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.987
Less website, but still a couple,

10
00:00:35.987 --> 00:00:39.560
they're adding web authentication
as a multi-factor.

11
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.257
So they still have username and password,
but also after you sign in with

12
00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:49.108
the username and password for
the first time, they say, hey, next time,

13
00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:53.750
do you wanna log in with Face ID or
Touch ID to increase user experience?

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.920
Probably you have seen that as a user.

15
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.720
So as a backup, you still have a username
and password, an insecure username and

16
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.856
password, okay?

17
00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:05.722
But you are adding a factor,
another factor,

18
00:01:05.722 --> 00:01:10.630
on top of that that uses biometrics or
USB keys.

19
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.959
And the goal, the final goal,
is to get to a passwordless

20
00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.179
authentication world, where in that case,

21
00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.470
your database will not have
a password at all, okay?

22
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.992
And so this has appear,

23
00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:33.755
so a few months ago, 2022.

24
00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:37.760
So the full passwordless solution,
it's called passkeys.

25
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.679
So we will talk about at the end
of today's workshop about that.

26
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.806
It's on iOS and Safari, and
it's coming on Edge on Windows,

27
00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:53.507
on Chrome on Android, on Chrome on desktop
in a couple of months, early 2023.

28
00:01:53.507 --> 00:01:58.349
So from 2023, every browser, or
at least latest versions of every

29
00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.477
browser in every platform,
are going to support passkeys.

30
00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:07.967
So we will start seeing more websites
offering the user the experience of

31
00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:14.367
logging in or registering an account with
a passkey and not with a password anymore.

32
00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:20.010
It will take time to make the whole
shift to a passwordless world, okay?

33
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.535
But we are going towards that goal,
make sense?

34
00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:27.279
Do you have any question at this point?

35
00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.145
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

36
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:35.653
So for the passwordless auth world, how
does that work with multiple devices then?

37
00:02:35.653 --> 00:02:39.523
&gt;&gt; In fact,
that's a spoiler for later, but

38
00:02:39.523 --> 00:02:44.477
the passwordless or
passkeys are actually WebAuthn.

39
00:02:44.477 --> 00:02:47.129
It's actually the same technology,
the same API.

40
00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.700
Server side is just the same,
so you implement WebAuthn.

41
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.171
So what's the difference?

42
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:57.007
There are a couple of difference,
but one of the difference is

43
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:02.570
that the device is storing
the passkey in multiple devices.

44
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.739
So in a standard WebAuthn
that works with your face or

45
00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.430
with your finger, stores the private
key only on that device.

46
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.776
In fact, if you buy a new phone,
even if you have the same finger,

47
00:03:16.776 --> 00:03:19.872
you won't have the same credentials, okay?

48
00:03:19.872 --> 00:03:21.652
When you change your phone,

49
00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:27.350
you need to register your Face ID again on
different apps, even on the phone itself.

50
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.848
I mean, for those of you that are buying
new phones, new Android phones, or

51
00:03:31.848 --> 00:03:35.083
new iPhones,
even if you're recovering the backup,

52
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:39.114
you still need to register your
fingers and your face again, okay?

53
00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:42.677
This is for
another hardware security thing.

54
00:03:42.677 --> 00:03:46.971
And you will also need to do that on
every website on every native app.

55
00:03:46.971 --> 00:03:52.510
But with passkeys, Microsoft,
iOS, or Apple and Google,

56
00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.395
they will store your passkeys
in your cloud account,

57
00:03:57.395 --> 00:04:03.815
in your Google account, in your iCloud,
in your Microsoft account.

58
00:04:03.815 --> 00:04:08.768
And it's going to be multi-device.

59
00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:12.204
For example,
if I'm saving a passkey in my iPhone,

60
00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:15.960
it will be available immediately
in my iPad and in my Mac.

61
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.961
And I'm not going to use the same,
well, maybe I'm not going

62
00:04:18.961 --> 00:04:23.022
to use the same biometric identification
because on my Mac, I don't have Face ID.

63
00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:26.342
It's going to be Touch ID, okay?

64
00:04:26.342 --> 00:04:31.662
It's going to be, in that case, store with
iCloud and with the security of iCloud.

65
00:04:31.662 --> 00:04:36.120
So you still need to access your
iCloud account to get your passkeys.

66
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.720
But that also leads to another
question that we will also see later.

67
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.282
What happens if you need to
log in on a Windows machine?

68
00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:47.890
Because, yeah, right now, I mean,
my computer is being repaired,

69
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.897
so I don't have a Mac,
I have a Windows computer.

70
00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:53.520
How can I use my passkeys?

71
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.560
Well, there is a solution for that.

72
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.049
We will talk about that later, but
through QR codes and Bluetooth,

73
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.820
you can log in on Windows with your phone.

74
00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.599
So if you still have one device
that has access to the passkey,

75
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:11.350
you can share the passkey
with another device.

76
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.902
And this is multi-vendor, so
it will work between Microsoft,

77
00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:18.951
between Microsoft Edge and Safari on iOS.

78
00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:23.405
&gt;&gt; So passkeys are the private keys which
are shared through a cloud on different

79
00:05:23.405 --> 00:05:24.030
devices.

80
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.596
&gt;&gt; So the passkey is the name,
it is a noun that we use for

81
00:05:29.596 --> 00:05:32.694
the idea of replacing the password.

82
00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:35.460
So the user will create passkeys.

83
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.651
But behind the passkey,
we have a whole architecture,

84
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:45.001
a whole solution that includes
the private key, and also a public key,

85
00:05:45.001 --> 00:05:50.110
and also sharing the private key
between your devices in the cloud.

86
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.056
So it's a whole system,
it's not just the name of the private key.

87
00:05:54.056 --> 00:06:02.026
But the idea that this group of browsers
have that includes Microsoft Edge,

88
00:06:02.026 --> 00:06:06.509
Google's Chrome, and Apple's Safari,

89
00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.380
the idea is to create
this mindset of passkey.

90
00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.612
So when the user sees,
I wanna log in with the passkey,

91
00:06:14.612 --> 00:06:17.081
they know what we're talking about, okay?

92
00:06:17.081 --> 00:06:17.738
That's the idea.

93
00:06:17.738 --> 00:06:20.440
So instead of a password,
we have passkeys.

94
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.362
So we will see that later, okay?

95
00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:23.890
But that's kind of the idea.

96
00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.575
So the passkey is not just the private
key, it's the whole system.

97
00:06:27.575 --> 00:06:31.237
But from a user perspective,
it's kind of the new password, okay?

98
00:06:31.237 --> 00:06:34.980
Password 2.0,
that's kind of a passkey, okay?

99
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.427
That is not just a secret that you define,
that kind of idea,

100
00:06:39.427 --> 00:06:41.990
that it's a complex
thing behind the scenes.
