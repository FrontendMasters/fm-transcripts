00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.310
All right, shall we rock and
roll on this first exercise?

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.579
I'm so excited about this.

3
00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:10.704
So non-nav mutations with useFetcher, so
we've got a form on the invoice ID page.

4
00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:15.665
So let me actually run node dev
1 to get this up and running,

5
00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:18.255
and you'll wanna do the same.

6
00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:23.837
Again, you wanna log in, kody@remix.run,
kodylovesyou is the password.

7
00:00:23.837 --> 00:00:28.277
We have a deposits input or
section here where you

8
00:00:28.277 --> 00:00:32.402
can add additional deposits for
an invoice.

9
00:00:32.402 --> 00:00:38.234
So let's say that for this cat drawing,
somebody paid an additional $3,000,

10
00:00:38.234 --> 00:00:42.775
they paid it today, another installment,
do whatever you want.

11
00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.279
And when I click Create,

12
00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:48.300
you're gonna notice we get a full
page refresh when that happens.

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.618
And we're being redirected back
to the same page where we are.

14
00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:57.612
What is actually happening is we
end up with a point in our history

15
00:00:57.612 --> 00:01:01.969
stack that points to the exact
same page that we're on.

16
00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.607
So we can go back and forth between these.

17
00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:08.521
And the browser is kind of acting,
the way that it does, actually,

18
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:11.750
it's kind of interesting how that works,
to go back and

19
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.271
forth between the same page,
that doesn't make any sense.

20
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:19.788
So whereas creating a new invoice
would redirect to that new

21
00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:24.319
invoice we just created,
that makes total sense for that.

22
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.886
In this case, it doesn't make sense to
redirect you where you're already at.

23
00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:30.991
So you could think of this as kind of
like favoriting a tweet, or whatever.

24
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:35.809
So your job is to change this so that it
behaves in such a way that it just makes

25
00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:40.257
a fetch request and does not involve
a navigation of any kind, okay?

26
00:01:40.257 --> 00:01:44.986
You'll notice that in the code
that we're using a regular form.

27
00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.618
Normally with Remix,
you're going to use the uppercase form, so

28
00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:49.125
you don't get the full page refresh.

29
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:54.912
But the uppercase form, the component form
that we typically are using with Remix,

30
00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:56.962
that also does a navigation.

31
00:01:56.962 --> 00:02:00.714
That emulates the same behavior
as a regular form, and

32
00:02:00.714 --> 00:02:04.885
so you're still gonna get this
entry in your history stack.

33
00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:06.833
And that is not desirable either.

34
00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:09.824
So we're going to use
a special hook called

35
00:02:09.824 --> 00:02:14.818
useFetcher to just make a fetch
request and not do a navigation, okay?

36
00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.790
I think that's enough background and
everything,

37
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.715
and you have the background in here,
so I will let you struggle a bit.

38
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:24.153
Like I said,
this one actually is literally two or

39
00:02:24.153 --> 00:02:28.119
three lines of code changed, so spend
a little time looking at the differences.
