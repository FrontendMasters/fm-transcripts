1
00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:07.528
That was hopefully for most of you, maybe
a letdown in the amount of effort it took.

2
00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:12.881
So we're gonna say exercise one and
go to the invoice ID because

3
00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:19.042
literally all you had to do is change
like three lines of code four maybe,

4
00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:23.089
so we need to use the use
fetcher API from Remix.

5
00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.208
So we'll get a Fetcher.

6
00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:28.198
We can call this something descriptive
because you can use more than

7
00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:29.882
one fetcher in a component.

8
00:00:29.882 --> 00:00:34.518
And so
I'm going to call this our depositFetcher.

9
00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:37.746
Maybe we'll call it the new
DepositFetcher to be even more clear.

10
00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:43.455
And we're gonna say,
use Fetcher from Remix run React.

11
00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:49.946
And the new deposit fetcher has a handy
little form component on it that

12
00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:56.889
is actually very similar to the global
form that you can import from remix.

13
00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:01.002
The only difference is that this
one does not trigger a navigation.

14
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.788
So no entry in the history stack.

15
00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:03.722
That's it.

16
00:01:03.722 --> 00:01:05.275
That is so you're like, okay,

17
00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:07.816
what do I use the regular
form versus a fetcher form?

18
00:01:07.816 --> 00:01:08.900
That is it.

19
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.264
If you don't want it to be another
entry in the history stack,

20
00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:15.385
then you use the regular or
then you use the fetcher form.

21
00:01:15.385 --> 00:01:17.082
And, yeah, that's it.

22
00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:18.350
We're done.

23
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.233
So if we come over here and
I will just open up a brand new thing,

24
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:24.945
there's no entries in the history stack.

25
00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:29.427
And I submit another $25 today.

26
00:01:29.427 --> 00:01:33.472
And we will see we still have
no entries in the history.

27
00:01:33.472 --> 00:01:37.264
So this is for favoriting your tweet, for
deleting the deposit for like, in fact,

28
00:01:37.264 --> 00:01:40.028
let's delete this deposit because
that's a lot of money and

29
00:01:40.028 --> 00:01:41.511
I want to see more yellow there.

30
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.123
So we'll delete that.

31
00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:44.627
And that was a fetcher.

32
00:01:44.627 --> 00:01:48.066
And that is it.

33
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:49.854
Any questions about this?

34
00:01:49.854 --> 00:01:50.854
Yeah.

35
00:01:50.854 --> 00:01:52.807
&gt;&gt; Just maybe a fun thing to expand on.

36
00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:58.872
Is there a good way to clear those values
after you submit or just use normal?

37
00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:01.129
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great question.

38
00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:06.835
So yes, I actually didn't call that out
and I should have we hit Create and

39
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:10.989
those values are still there
certainly not desired.

40
00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.514
The reason that it works before this is
because we're changing our location and

41
00:02:16.514 --> 00:02:18.089
triggers a rerender.

42
00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:22.952
And I believe we've got a key prop yeah
right here that has the key based on

43
00:02:22.952 --> 00:02:23.762
location.

44
00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:27.706
So anytime the location changes that
will trigger a rerender here and

45
00:02:27.706 --> 00:02:32.263
the reason that's useful is that as you
switch between these different users it

46
00:02:32.263 --> 00:02:34.560
updates all of this content.

47
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.759
That actually doesn't matter for
these things.

48
00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.294
They will update for sure.

49
00:02:38.294 --> 00:02:42.398
It's just an anything that's
maintaining state internally,

50
00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:45.979
if it's not remounted,
will maintain that old state.

51
00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:49.924
So that's why we have the key prop with
the location key you don't always need

52
00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:50.538
to do that.

53
00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:54.092
But yeah so, that's why it was
working before because we're actually,

54
00:02:54.092 --> 00:02:56.627
it's a new location even
though it's the same URL.

55
00:02:56.627 --> 00:03:01.257
It's technically a new location and
now we don't have that now.

56
00:03:01.257 --> 00:03:05.699
The location is the same and so
we're not clearing out the form so

57
00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:10.728
the solution to that is actually in
upcoming exercises so great question

58
00:03:10.728 --> 00:03:14.845
&gt;&gt; How do we decide between use fetter and

59
00:03:14.845 --> 00:03:16.525
use fetchers?

60
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:17.897
&gt;&gt; Okay yeah use fetchers is another.

61
00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:22.295
We will not be getting into that today,
but

62
00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:28.294
what useFectors does is it gets
you a list of all fetchers.

63
00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:32.913
So all of the fetchers everywhere in
the application will be in this list so

64
00:03:32.913 --> 00:03:38.055
any anytime any other component calls
useFetcher it's creating a new fetcher and

65
00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:40.306
that will show up in this list here?

66
00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:46.851
This is useful for actually let's see, if
I want to, I'll show an app later when we

67
00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:52.387
start talking about optimistic UI
that uses use fetchers quite a bit.

68
00:03:52.387 --> 00:03:56.093
It can be useful for
optimistic UI in particular.

69
00:03:56.093 --> 00:04:00.396
I think that's probably its primary use.

70
00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:03.793
But yeah,
we're not gonna be using it today.

71
00:04:03.793 --> 00:04:08.432
It's more for collecting existing
fetchers rather than creating.

72
00:04:08.432 --> 00:04:12.316
So useFetcher,
will create a fetcher for you.

73
00:04:12.316 --> 00:04:13.714
Cool, any other questions?

74
00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:16.955
Yeah, true.

75
00:04:16.955 --> 00:04:21.797
&gt;&gt; I guess a general question is to
help with like the understanding of it

76
00:04:21.797 --> 00:04:24.896
is like to me it seems
like it's not really.

77
00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:29.473
Like when you use useFtcher.form
it's not really any different on

78
00:04:29.473 --> 00:04:31.323
the server side is it more.

79
00:04:31.323 --> 00:04:33.588
I guess like how's it
working I'm just kidding

80
00:04:33.588 --> 00:04:34.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah so

81
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.895
as far as the the network request is
concerned is the request will be the same.

82
00:04:39.895 --> 00:04:42.104
So, if we say here's my amount?

83
00:04:42.104 --> 00:04:44.502
Here's my day?

84
00:04:44.502 --> 00:04:47.098
And I hit create this post request so,

85
00:04:47.098 --> 00:04:51.642
it's still gonna be a form data all
of the same things apply and so,

86
00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:56.366
yeah, we didn't need to change our
back end code it'll be the same.

87
00:04:56.366 --> 00:05:02.052
The one thing to to note about
this though is that if you're

88
00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:07.855
switching from a regular form
to a form that doesn't have or

89
00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:14.492
to a fetcher form normally your back
end code is gonna do a redirect.

90
00:05:14.492 --> 00:05:17.782
Because that's like how you
probably set it up initially.

91
00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:20.187
And so
it'll like redirect to the same place.

92
00:05:20.187 --> 00:05:24.065
So that is one thing you may need to
change if you're doing this switch is just

93
00:05:24.065 --> 00:05:27.110
make sure that you're not doing
a redirect from a fetcher.

94
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.365
Unless that's what you wanna do.

95
00:05:28.365 --> 00:05:32.124
Like let's say that you say,
somebody tries to do fetcher, but

96
00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.712
they timed out in their login or
something.

97
00:05:34.712 --> 00:05:35.989
So now you're gonna redirect them.

98
00:05:35.989 --> 00:05:41.878
So they're like it's not bad to
redirect from a fetcher action but

99
00:05:41.878 --> 00:05:49.220
yeah, typically what I do I just
return a response okay, and it's fine.

100
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.013
&gt;&gt; Will JavaScript still
be enhancement for

101
00:05:52.013 --> 00:05:55.293
remix application while
using the use Fetcher?

102
00:05:55.293 --> 00:05:59.944
&gt;&gt; Yeah that's a great question
let's see what happens if I say no

103
00:05:59.944 --> 00:06:02.149
JavaScript on the page okay.

104
00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:07.119
JavaScript okay no JavaScript
happening here and

105
00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:14.096
we say we want 35 new thing,
hit Create, we get a full page refresh,

106
00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:19.085
because there's no
JavaScript to prevent that.

107
00:06:19.085 --> 00:06:24.498
And I guess I shouldn't have done 235 in
a row but yeah, it so it still works.

108
00:06:24.498 --> 00:06:26.621
It is still a progressive enhancement.

109
00:06:26.621 --> 00:06:30.642
If Twitter had written their like button
with useFetcher your likes would still

110
00:06:30.642 --> 00:06:34.483
work and just be super annoying because
it's gonna do a full page refresh but

111
00:06:34.483 --> 00:06:35.642
still totally works.

112
00:06:35.642 --> 00:06:39.072
&gt;&gt; That's probably why it's important to
have the invoice invoice ID in the in

113
00:06:39.072 --> 00:06:42.768
the URL, because it was doing a full page
refresh and you didn't have that you just

114
00:06:42.768 --> 00:06:45.581
go like to the top
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so, like on Twitter,

115
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:49.378
if you're scrolling down and you like
a tweet you don't have JavaScript,

116
00:06:49.378 --> 00:06:52.088
I mean on Twitter it won't work at all,
but if that was

117
00:06:52.088 --> 00:06:56.091
your use case you'd hit the favorite and
yeah you'd start up at the top again.

118
00:06:56.091 --> 00:07:00.464
Which we just do the best that
we can with whatever level

119
00:07:00.464 --> 00:07:03.615
of progressive enhancement we are at.

120
00:07:03.615 --> 00:07:05.679
But, most of the time people
are gonna have JavaScript,

121
00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:07.190
most of the time it's going to work fine.

122
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.817
But yeah, good to think about
progressive enhancement yeah.

123
00:07:10.817 --> 00:07:14.872
&gt;&gt; Are we avoiding mutations
outside of forms entirely?

124
00:07:14.872 --> 00:07:20.409
&gt;&gt; Most of the time your user
interactive mutations should be forms.

125
00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:22.315
I would say probably all the time no,

126
00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:24.848
not all the time there
are exceptions of course.

127
00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:29.284
But the vast majority of the time
if the user is interacting and

128
00:07:29.284 --> 00:07:33.720
triggering a mutation that should
have be modeled as a form for

129
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.385
progressive enhancement reasons.

130
00:07:36.385 --> 00:07:39.204
And also it's just like
a way simpler way to do it.

131
00:07:39.204 --> 00:07:43.981
But we'll see you later in the exercises
today that and you have plenty of

132
00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:49.006
situations where the initiating mutation
and we can do that imperatively.

133
00:07:49.006 --> 00:07:54.098
We would use useFetcher for
that as well, but

134
00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:59.598
when we get that you can
find out how do we do that?

135
00:07:59.598 --> 00:08:01.622
&gt;&gt; Like button in a form.

136
00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:03.310
&gt;&gt; Yes, I would exactly.

137
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.170
Yep in fact, if you look at the deposits
I said earlier that this was a fetcher.

138
00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.624
But it's actually not because we
will redirect from this deposits to

139
00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:11.882
just the deposits page.

140
00:08:11.882 --> 00:08:13.196
So that's not a fetcher.

141
00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:18.342
But even this Delete button
is inside of a form.

142
00:08:20.776 --> 00:08:25.256
So, gone are the days where you just
render a delete that has an on click.

143
00:08:25.256 --> 00:08:31.161
Yeah you don't need that anymore it's just
a submit button this it's progressively

144
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:36.420
enhanced it's like dang simple there's
no event management or whatever.

145
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.536
Yeah, you will prefer this.

146
00:08:41.536 --> 00:08:45.495
Even though it may be a little different,
it was different for

147
00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:49.773
me to think yeah, I guess I can
just put a form around that thing.

148
00:08:49.773 --> 00:08:51.619
Cool yeah.

149
00:08:51.619 --> 00:08:52.595
&gt;&gt; I have one more question.

150
00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:57.033
How does remix know what
routes to revalidate after

151
00:08:57.033 --> 00:08:59.723
submitting the form example?

152
00:08:59.723 --> 00:09:02.488
&gt;&gt; Good questions.
So remix re validates everything,

153
00:09:02.488 --> 00:09:05.539
all current routes that
are active on the page or

154
00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:10.431
if you redirected then it's not rebounded,
it's just loading all those.

155
00:09:10.431 --> 00:09:14.677
But if you redirected within it, you've
got a parents and you have a child and

156
00:09:14.677 --> 00:09:16.980
you're redirecting between siblings.

157
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:19.265
And then the parent will
actually also revalidate.

158
00:09:19.265 --> 00:09:21.484
So yes the way that the web works or

159
00:09:21.484 --> 00:09:26.003
the defaults of the web is you submit
a form you're getting all brand

160
00:09:26.003 --> 00:09:29.824
new HTML open HTML to closing
like the whole thing is new.

161
00:09:29.824 --> 00:09:34.491
So remix emulates that same behavior which
is correct, that's the right thing to do.

162
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:38.560
And in some cases, it may not be optimal,
which is where optimizations come in.

163
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.944
So the default is right,
optimizations are possible,

164
00:09:43.944 --> 00:09:47.501
and we will get into that later yeah.

165
00:09:47.501 --> 00:09:55.470
&gt;&gt; How do you useFetcher to fetch
data not associated with UI routes?

166
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.013
&gt;&gt; We will actually get into that.

167
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.058
Yep for sure.

168
00:09:58.058 --> 00:10:02.947
When we build this
Create Invoice Customer thing as we were

169
00:10:02.947 --> 00:10:07.354
typing in here that's not
associated to UI routes.

170
00:10:07.354 --> 00:10:10.396
That's just a component and
we will get into that.

171
00:10:10.396 --> 00:10:12.236
&gt;&gt; What if we have a postcode and

172
00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:17.010
another route when using useFetcher
other than the current route?

173
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.326
We need an action prop in the fetcher,
right?

174
00:10:19.326 --> 00:10:23.357
But how do we construct the path so
that it hits the correctly desired route?

175
00:10:23.357 --> 00:10:24.669
&gt;&gt; Yeah, good question.

176
00:10:24.669 --> 00:10:27.379
So we can provide
an action prompt to this.

177
00:10:27.379 --> 00:10:32.203
And this action will need to point
to a route somewhere that can accept

178
00:10:32.203 --> 00:10:33.210
that action.

179
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:38.586
So you'd say like api/ yeah,
that works except you want

180
00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:44.641
to put in the actual Invoice ID so
stringfy that thing whatever.

181
00:10:44.641 --> 00:10:49.259
But yes that is totally possible and
you'll just need to create a resource

182
00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:52.623
route at that path in your
file system to handle that.

183
00:10:52.623 --> 00:10:57.286
We will sort of touch on this later.

184
00:10:57.286 --> 00:11:01.371
Most of the time I find that I don't
use the action prop most of the time.

185
00:11:01.371 --> 00:11:03.130
It's just easier to have
it in the same file.

186
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.782
But there are certainly
some situations where and

187
00:11:05.782 --> 00:11:09.265
we're rendering this component
in a bunch of different places.

188
00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:11.664
All of them we want to go
to this specific route.

189
00:11:11.664 --> 00:11:15.055
We will talk about that a little bit,
not with the fetcher form.

190
00:11:15.055 --> 00:11:17.270
But with a different thing that
you can use with the fetcher.
