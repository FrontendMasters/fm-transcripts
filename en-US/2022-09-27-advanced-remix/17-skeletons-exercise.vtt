1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.620
So node dev 8 and we'll

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.596
come over to exercise 8.

3
00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:14.394
Now we're talking about skeletons and
not like skeletons in the closet but

4
00:00:14.394 --> 00:00:15.699
like UI skeletons.

5
00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:21.550
I actually missed out on an opportunity
to put a skeleton, your skeleton.

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.815
There we go.
Tada, there you go.

7
00:00:23.815 --> 00:00:25.193
There's your skeleton.

8
00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:26.900
So loading spinners are awesome.

9
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.667
We can do a little bit better and

10
00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:35.314
we're going to improve this
experience further by making it so

11
00:00:35.314 --> 00:00:41.065
you're actually let's get on here so
I can demonstrate that for

12
00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:45.241
you and koddy@remix.run, Kody loves you.

13
00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.313
So when you go between
these different customers,

14
00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:51.824
I want to be able to render
something over here instantly.

15
00:00:51.824 --> 00:00:56.542
Getting that spinner up there, that's
great and all, but the user might not

16
00:00:56.542 --> 00:01:01.116
notice it like so maybe there's an
argument to be had for improving the user

17
00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:05.779
experience by making it more obvious or
something, talk to your designer.

18
00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:10.157
But it would be nicer to have a more
co located loading experience.

19
00:01:10.157 --> 00:01:15.742
And so if I click on this, it should
render some sort of skeleton UI here,

20
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:20.336
that's the desired outcome for
this specific situation.

21
00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:22.400
That's not always the desired outcome.

22
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.654
It actually can be nice to click on this
and be like, you know what, actually,

23
00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:27.109
I want to go to that invoice, right?

24
00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:32.126
So while it's transitioning,
making use of what you have now might

25
00:01:32.126 --> 00:01:36.976
be better than seeing just nonsense
until that other page loads.

26
00:01:36.976 --> 00:01:40.290
So it's not 100% of the time
skeletons are better.

27
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.742
This is more of the art
side of making a web app.

28
00:01:44.742 --> 00:01:49.502
But for our case, we're going to say that
it's better to instantly update this and

29
00:01:49.502 --> 00:01:51.476
show a skeleton for the invoices.

30
00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:55.845
Interesting thing here is that we actually
have all the information we need for

31
00:01:55.845 --> 00:02:00.011
this part of the app before we even go to
the loader for this customer ID to get

32
00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:04.410
that information because we literally
just loaded it over here in the parent.

33
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.852
So the parent already knows and
we could click on this and

34
00:02:07.852 --> 00:02:11.746
instantly show the email address and
the name of our customer.

35
00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:15.494
And then just have the slow
part which is the invoices and

36
00:02:15.494 --> 00:02:18.704
the the part we don't have yet
be the skeleton.

37
00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:22.410
So that's what our skeleton does,
it accepts the name of the company and

38
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.830
the email as prompts and
then shows the skeleton for the invoices.

39
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.613
So that is your job I've wrote
this skeleton for you and

40
00:02:29.613 --> 00:02:34.382
your job is just to make it so
that as the user clicks on these different

41
00:02:34.382 --> 00:02:39.334
customers you can send that customer's
information to the skeleton.

42
00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:42.711
And you can know that you
need to render the skeleton,

43
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:44.750
when we're in a loading state.

44
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.913
The interesting thing here,
is that we're actually going

45
00:02:47.913 --> 00:02:52.291
to be rendering the skeleton instead of
the outlet, when we're transitioning.

46
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:57.007
So we actually say, the heck with my
children, was just such a, what a jerk for

47
00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.808
a parent, but
that's what they were saying.

48
00:02:59.808 --> 00:03:01.778
Like, I don't care if I have children.

49
00:03:01.778 --> 00:03:07.176
I'm not rendering, don't render those I'm
just going to render the skeleton instead.

50
00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:11.850
So have a good time with that this
is in the customers route and yeah,

51
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.658
rock on with exercise 8.
