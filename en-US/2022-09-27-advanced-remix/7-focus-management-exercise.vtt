00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.039
Before you move on to exercise three, I
want you to take notes on what you learned

2
00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:06.260
in exercise two so
you remember this stuff.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.120
And now,
we're moving on to exercise three.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.153
So we'll go close up
the server node dev 3,

5
00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:24.290
open up 03 Readme,
go to port 4003 and log in.

6
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.620
I'm going to not be on a slow
3G network for this one.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.469
And we'll go kody@remix.run and
kodylovesyou.

8
00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.630
And there we go.

9
00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:44.009
Great, so we're all set with
our focus management exercise.

10
00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:50.660
So for this one, if you look at the files
here, we're still on the invoice ID route.

11
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.360
So we're still working
within the same route.

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.110
We want to focus on
the element that has an error.

13
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.985
So if we submit with an error,

14
00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:06.160
we want to automatically focus
on the one that has the error.

15
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:13.830
And if there is no error,
we want to focus on the first input.

16
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.470
So the use case that
you're thinking about is,

17
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.902
you've got somebody who's
entering in a bunch of deposits,

18
00:01:19.902 --> 00:01:23.928
they do this once a week, they enter
in all the deposits for the week, and

19
00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:27.910
they don't want to have to move their
mouse between every single time.

20
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.230
They just wanna type it in, tap taps,
hit Enter, and keep going, just move,

21
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.630
move, move.

22
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.995
The challenge that you'll have here
is because we're doing optimistic UI,

23
00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:44.524
sometimes we're gonna go back to the user,
might actually go back to that input

24
00:01:44.524 --> 00:01:50.235
before we have a chance to query it out,
and they might start changing it, right?

25
00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:52.560
So if that's what they've done,

26
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.435
then you resetting the input
will mess up their work.

27
00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:00.433
And so you have to be a little bit smarter
about how you're going to make sure you

28
00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:02.445
only reset it when it's appropriate.

29
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.540
And yeah, so
just some things to think about.

30
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.368
That aspect is less about Remix and more
about like thinking about good UX, but

31
00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:13.710
Remix is all about good UX.

32
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.658
And so we're thinking about
these sorts of things.

33
00:02:16.658 --> 00:02:21.051
I gave you some good background
information on how to accomplish this, and

34
00:02:21.051 --> 00:02:25.183
I think that should be enough for
you to get started on exercise three.

35
00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:26.620
So have a good time.
