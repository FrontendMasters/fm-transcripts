00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:03.210
Welcome back to exercise six.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.866
Hopefully, you had a great
time working through that.

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:06.621
Let's work through this together.

4
00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:09.860
So pretty much as soon as
you show up on this page,

5
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.868
we're going to get this
modal that comes up.

6
00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:14.896
Again, I mentioned this
is already built for you.

7
00:00:14.896 --> 00:00:18.610
And it has this handy little feature where
if the user is actually using the app,

8
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.947
the model doesn't show up.

9
00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:23.519
It only shows up when the user
stops navigating around,

10
00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.414
stops performing mutations all that stuff.

11
00:00:26.414 --> 00:00:31.892
And then it says, hey, kind of want
you to get out of here I guess.

12
00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:36.053
So this code is inside
of this logout timer.

13
00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:39.426
Feel free to peruse how all
of this stuff works, but

14
00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:42.575
it's really not anything
crazy complicated.

15
00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:47.774
Also it only renders when
there's a user logged in.

16
00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:51.599
So if the user ever logs out,
then we're not rendering the LogoutTimer.

17
00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:52.924
It doesn't.

18
00:00:52.924 --> 00:00:55.679
The logged out user isn't
gonna get the modal.

19
00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.710
Okay, so for what our job is,
is we want to have

20
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.238
a submit hook that will trigger a logout.

21
00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:10.193
And we are going to use that in this
logout function which is then used when

22
00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:13.036
the timer times out and all of that stuff,

23
00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:17.278
all the React things that we're
not gonna be covering today.

24
00:01:17.278 --> 00:01:25.235
So, let's add that submit hook
let's say submit useSubmit.

25
00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:29.996
And then I just shorten the time for
you so it shows up quicker so

26
00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:34.208
we can skip over that and
now when it's time to log out,

27
00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:39.627
we're going to use this submit hook or
the submit function to submit.

28
00:01:39.627 --> 00:01:42.618
Actually, you typically don't need
to submit anything when you're just

29
00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:43.192
logging out.

30
00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:47.621
But for us our logout has this fancy
little feature where if you provide

31
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:52.347
a redirect to that will go into the URL
and that tells the login form that when

32
00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:57.775
they've logged in, they're gonna redirect
to whatever that redirect to is set to.

33
00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:01.871
And so for us,
we want to redirect to where we came from.

34
00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.869
And so we're gonna say redirect.

35
00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.668
RedirectTo is location.pathname.

36
00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:12.896
So wherever we're at currently, that's
where I want this to come back to, so

37
00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:16.369
that the user can log back in and
just pick up where they left off.

38
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:21.792
The other thing that we wanna make sure
that we do is specify the action as logout

39
00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:26.907
otherwise, this will submit to
the current URL we don't want to do that.

40
00:02:26.907 --> 00:02:30.975
We're actually trying to send
them somewhere ultimately,

41
00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:32.737
they'll end up at login.

42
00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:35.674
But we're sending them
over to the logout route.

43
00:02:35.674 --> 00:02:39.504
And then the logout route will
redirect them to the login.

44
00:02:39.504 --> 00:02:42.683
And then we also want
to post to the logout.

45
00:02:42.683 --> 00:02:45.753
And the reason this is
actually important web stuff.

46
00:02:45.753 --> 00:02:52.551
The reason that you post to a logout, and
you normally only do mutations on post

47
00:02:52.551 --> 00:02:58.010
requests is because otherwise you
open up your users to cross or

48
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.444
what is it called CSRF
cross site request forgery.

49
00:03:02.444 --> 00:03:08.352
Where the malicious actor
can trigger a get request

50
00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:13.575
on your server using
that user's browser and

51
00:03:13.575 --> 00:03:19.084
without the user interacting
with that at all.

52
00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:23.890
So we're gonna use a method of which
effectively would mean they could log

53
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.767
users out of your site without
their express permission but

54
00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:29.794
could be even more malicious.

55
00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:34.277
So you typically want to do
mutation type things on postponing.

56
00:03:34.277 --> 00:03:34.886
Okay, great.

57
00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:37.433
So then we have Dan, fill that in for us.

58
00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:39.331
And we should be all set.

59
00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:41.294
So we come back in here,

60
00:03:41.294 --> 00:03:47.197
they're gonna refresh just to make
sure modal pops up, and we log out.

61
00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:50.277
And then if I go login, cody@remix.run.

62
00:03:50.277 --> 00:03:53.376
Cody loves you.

63
00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:54.791
And here we are.

64
00:03:54.791 --> 00:04:01.908
And then yeah, I want to remain
logged in or I wanna log out, cool?

65
00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:05.676
And then of course, you wouldn't
typically have it be this long,

66
00:04:05.676 --> 00:04:10.003
so, we've got it set to 24 hours,
it's probably a little much, right?

67
00:04:10.003 --> 00:04:12.961
Maybe 30 minutes, might be better, but

68
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:16.587
yeah, that's all going to
be your PMS decision so.

69
00:04:16.587 --> 00:04:18.060
[LAUGH]
