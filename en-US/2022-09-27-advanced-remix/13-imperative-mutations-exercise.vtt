00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.738
Let's close this down so
we can work on or get introduced to

2
00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:09.665
exercise 6, Which we will do now.

3
00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:13.360
So open up the readme in exercise 6 and

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.213
stop the server for
exercise 5, run node dev 6.

5
00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:25.854
Then we'll come over here, go to 4006,
log in with kody@remix.run,

6
00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:31.527
kodylovesyou, and boom,
we're back in the app, back in action.

7
00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:35.265
And instantly, poof,
we get the logout modal.

8
00:00:35.265 --> 00:00:37.545
So this is actually what
we're gonna be working on.

9
00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:39.337
You may not have noticed, but

10
00:00:39.337 --> 00:00:44.215
there was a logout modal that pops up
after I think an hour or something.

11
00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:47.921
In this exercise, we've reduced that
to five seconds, and then you get

12
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:52.420
another two seconds before this modal
goes away and you get logged out.

13
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.799
So your job is to implement
the auto logout functionality.

14
00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.436
We're doing a mutation that is imperative.

15
00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:05.893
The user didn't do anything, and so
we're going to log them out automatically.

16
00:01:05.893 --> 00:01:09.850
All of the modal stuff, the timers,
all of that is implemented for you.

17
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.360
This is not a React workshop.

18
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.350
So your job is just to trigger the fetch
that will make them be logged out.

19
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.051
So I give an example of what actually
how I've done something like

20
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:23.510
this on my own blog.

21
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.240
And my blog,
I actually use a fetcher for this.

22
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.024
In our case,
we're actually doing a navigation, and so

23
00:01:31.024 --> 00:01:34.100
we're not gonna use a fetcher
cuz a fetcher has no navigation.

24
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.600
We're actually gonna navigate
them to the login screen.

25
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.510
So we're going to be using useSubmit,
which is the exact same as useFetcher, or

26
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.020
it's the exact same as useFetcher.submit,
except it actually triggers a navigation.

27
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.840
So that's what we're gonna be using.

28
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.322
And yeah,
you're gonna be working in the app root.

29
00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:56.318
So have an excellent experience
on your exercise 6, and

30
00:01:56.318 --> 00:01:58.660
we'll see you on the other side.
