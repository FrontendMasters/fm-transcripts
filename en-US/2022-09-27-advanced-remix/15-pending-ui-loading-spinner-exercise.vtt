00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.246
For Exercise 7, 8 and 8,

2
00:00:02.246 --> 00:00:07.770
we're gonna be working with a arbitrarily
slowed down user experience.

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.999
I actually slowed down
the back end a little bit so

4
00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.390
we can play around with this
just to make it easier.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.110
So you don't have to do a slow 3G
connection, but for the Exercise 7 and 8,

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.500
the slowdown that we're trying to
improve is actually the user's network.

7
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.024
For 9, we'll deal with, okay,
what happens if you're the one who's slow?

8
00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.120
It's not the user, but it's you.

9
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.833
But for seven and eight, we're gonna say,

10
00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:40.680
sometimes the users network is no good and
you have no control over that.

11
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.176
How do we make the users
experience not just total trash

12
00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:47.160
with that type of environment?

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.890
So, we're gonna be using this handy little
thing called Use Transition to show

14
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.664
a loading spinner on our app.

15
00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:56.930
And we've got the loading
spinner implemented for you.

16
00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.031
We do have a mini extra credit for this
one to use a package called Spin Delay so

17
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:05.310
you don't get a flash of loading state,
which is kinda interesting.

18
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.311
So, ultimately where this
loading spinner is gonna go,

19
00:01:11.311 --> 00:01:16.186
I think, let's also node dev 7, herein, so

20
00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:21.313
this will be port 4007, Kotty remix.run,

21
00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:24.830
Kotty loves you, and here we go.

22
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.162
Yep, I was on a previous,

23
00:01:27.162 --> 00:01:33.001
the data is different between
every workshop or every exercise.

24
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:37.722
So, we have made the customer's
route really slow.

25
00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:42.470
If I click on customers,
we're waiting, waiting, waiting!

26
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.090
And finally, it loads.

27
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.815
It's not a good experience if I'm in
invoices and then go to go toccustomers

28
00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:49.640
are waiting, waiting,
you'll see that the URL is updated.

29
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.970
But it takes a while before
we actually get to that.

30
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.389
And the thing we made slow
is getting these invoices,

31
00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.920
we're just making that piece really slow.

32
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.741
So yeah, we're just gonna deal with that,

33
00:02:00.741 --> 00:02:05.720
we're gonna pretend that this is the users
network that causes us to be slow.

34
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.771
The other thing that I wanted
to mention about this, right.

35
00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:16.111
We already also have prefetching enabled,
we learned about prefetching in

36
00:02:16.111 --> 00:02:20.447
the Remix Fundamentals Workshop and so
if you hover over one of these links,

37
00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:25.188
this can take anywhere from three to five
seconds I think, if you hover for a while,

38
00:02:25.188 --> 00:02:28.070
and then click,
then it instantly transitions.

39
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.287
So, I believe that's actually
even the case for the customers,

40
00:02:31.287 --> 00:02:35.040
so, if you hover over that for a second,
and then click then it's instant.

41
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.757
So, we have done a little bit,

42
00:02:36.757 --> 00:02:41.251
but we wanna make that loading experience
better, even if we had about a fast back

43
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:44.740
end because sometimes
the user's network is no good.

44
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.110
And you're gonna put a loading spinner
up here next to the FakeBooks logo.

45
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.142
And I think that is everything that you
need to know to be able to start working

46
00:02:53.142 --> 00:02:53.647
on this.
