[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:09.959
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And as a more appropriate
live demo, let me show you in our final

3
00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:15.350
few minutes together,
some products which are using web peer.

4
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.620
I need one volunteer to raise their hand.

5
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.566
Okay, well I'm going to type
in frontendmasters here.

6
00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:28.590
And I'm gonna join this thing, which
allows me to share my video and audio.

7
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.020
I want you to go to
talky.io/frontendmaster.

8
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.288
I didn't put the s on the end,
so just frontendmaster.

9
00:00:34.288 --> 00:00:39.635
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Talky.io

10
00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:44.290
is a service that's built
by a company called &amp;yet.

11
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.472
They're a leader in peer to
peer WebRTC technology, and

12
00:00:48.472 --> 00:00:52.519
this is a completely free
web conferencing service.

13
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.990
Totally encrypted.

14
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.470
Not only does it allow you to
share your video and audio, but

15
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.980
they just recently added
in screen cast sharing.

16
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.820
So if you're in Chrome, you can share
your screen against somebody else.

17
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.458
Is it popping up for you?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I've used this tool before

18
00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:10.610
actually.
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

19
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.980
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: There we go.

20
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.180
I got somebody else to add in.

21
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.930
There we go.

22
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.790
I'm better turn down the audio.

23
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.010
Now you can see that the two of us,
you can connect with your grandma on

24
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.250
the other side of the world,
completely for free.

25
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.490
Totally through web technology and
there's no middleman, because now

26
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.370
that we've been in establishing peer
to peer connection now we're talking.

27
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.080
So now we've got three
of us in the same thing.

28
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.740
So it's a lot like Google Hangouts,
except it's completely free and

29
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.390
there's no evil corporation in the middle.

30
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.030
All right.

31
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.940
So just a couple of other quick
things to point out to you.

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.200
Things that are being built on
peer to peer data channels.

33
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.400
There's a service that was built.

34
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.490
By a group of researchers
at MIT called PeerServer.

35
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.470
It's literally exactly
what it sounds like.

36
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.820
You spin up a web server
inside of your browser and

37
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.240
you serve up web pages to
other people that are nearby.

38
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.600
So imagine you and your company go for
a week offsite team meeting and

39
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.360
you wanna spin up a Wiki Server for
everybody to collaborate during the week.

40
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.120
Well, one of you spins it
up on your laptop, and

41
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.630
the rest of the people on the team just
connect directly to that system and

42
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.230
you don't need to stick all of your
work files out on some outer server.

43
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.350
Another thing,
this actually is really cool,

44
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.950
and might blow your mind a little bit.

45
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.550
This is a service that started up as kind
of an interesting thing but PeerCDN,

46
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.810
what they did Is they built a service
that allows you to put a script tag

47
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.320
in your page, and it hijacks your page and
any of the places in the page where you're

48
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.540
loading resources from a CDN location,
like from the Google CDN or whatever.

49
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.600
What it does,
is instead of loading them from the CDN,

50
00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.000
it attempts in the background to
establish a peer to peer connection

51
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.780
with somebody else who's also
on the site at that moment.

52
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.080
And if they are on the site and

53
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.210
they've already downloaded the files,
it sends you those files over the peer to

54
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.420
peer connection rather than
through the bandwidth connection.

55
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.010
So as a provider of a site.

56
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.793
You have the ability to serve up less
bandwidth, which means it's gonna save you

57
00:03:18.793 --> 00:03:21.090
costs because you're not paying for
CDN bandwidth.

58
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.420
And also they proved,
that it was in general, much quicker for

59
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.670
users to get files from their
peers than from some CDN.

60
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.380
And it did it completely in the background
without you even knowing that it was

61
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.210
happening and if it failed to download it.

62
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.800
It fell back to the normal loading.

63
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.550
And so that sounds like the sort of hack
that nobody could actually pull off but

64
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.210
they did it so

65
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.496
well that Yahoo acquired them few a few
months ago, so that's pretty cool.

66
00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:50.730
It's a kinda a big success story for
these peer to peer technologies.

67
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.751
There is a sharefest.me, [COUGH]
this is exactly what it sounds like,

68
00:03:57.751 --> 00:04:03.106
a completely secured anonymous
instant file sharing

69
00:04:03.106 --> 00:04:08.214
peer to peer,
without anybody in the middle.

70
00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:11.870
You wanna drop an MP3 file to your
grandma, tell her to go to this site

71
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.660
exactly like you do with talk, tell her to
go to this site, you drop a file in there,

72
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.800
bam, it shows up on her computer and
vice versa.

73
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.560
Using the peer to peer data connection.

74
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.990
And there's lots and lots of others.

75
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.960
I could spend lots and lots of extra
time talking about the capabilities.

76
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.470
We're not even beginning
to scratch the surface

77
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.770
of what peer to peer data connections are
going to give us in terms of a different

78
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.000
way of doing the web than
we've ever done before.

79
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.460
So I'm really excited about that.

80
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.520
I'm excited about the performance
benefits, I'm excited about

81
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.750
the security and the privacy benefits that
we're gonna get from the peer to peer web.

82
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.510
But it's a web that we have to build.

83
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.670
It's a web that everybody in
this room has to help us build.

84
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:55.660
So if we sit around and

85
00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.470
we say, just I'm worried about
getting rounded corners into my app,

86
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.540
and sit five years in the past, somebody
else is gonna be making the decision.

87
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.870
It's probably going to be some evil
corporation that none of us like,

88
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.240
that makes the decisions for
the future of this technology.

89
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.180
So, I would implore you, if you don't
get anything else out of today,

90
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.700
start experimenting with this technology.

91
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.840
Start experimenting with peer-to-peer
technology, use the frameworks and

92
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.660
things that are out there, and
pushing back on this stuff,

93
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.626
because we are in a position to form the
next major inflection point of the web.

94
00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:34.540
And it's gonna open up a whole new
world of possibilities that we

95
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.000
weren't capable of doing before.

96
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.580
So, hopefully, you come away from today
with a lot more confidence about where

97
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.910
to start with node, about where to start
with hacking up command line tools or

98
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.000
building little web things.

99
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.310
The very first node program that
I ever built several years back,

100
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.080
I was working at that game company.

101
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:03.590
And we needed a tool to essentially,
it wasn't really load testing,

102
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.050
but we needed a tool to test whether or
not the bingo game was capable

103
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.910
of handling 5,000 concurrent
players in the same bingo game.

104
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.300
Was the game logic actually correct
to handle all those players and

105
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.400
calling things?

106
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.260
And so I actually wrote a node.js bot that
would spin up 5,000 instances of itself.

107
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.860
It knew the rules of the game, in terms
of being served up random numbers, and

108
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.690
looking for bingo, and
calling out bingo and stuff.

109
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.870
And these bots would play
against our game server

110
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.840
in real time to try to test whether or
not the server was written correctly.

111
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.657
So the possibilities for
what you can do with node are endless.

112
00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:45.360
They're really as limited as you
are willing to start experimenting and

113
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.790
I hope you come away from today
with the confidence that it's

114
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.320
time to get experimenting,
it's time to start pushing on that stuff.

115
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.796
I hope I've given you lots of
different ways to think about it,

116
00:06:54.796 --> 00:06:58.050
different kinds of conversations
that you can have with your bosses.

117
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.660
It's been a true honor to give this
workshop over the last couple of days.

118
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.190
Hope you've learned a lot of great things,
I hope you'll give us feedback and I'll be

119
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.600
giving this workshop many more times, help
me get feedback to help me make it better.

120
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.280
And again I wanna remind you.

121
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.540
I'll go back to my slide
as my finishing thing.

122
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.000
I wanna remind you that as an open
ended invitation to all of my

123
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.390
attendees of any workshop from here
on out, if you have any thoughts or

124
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:25.970
questions six months from now you're
going back over the exercises and

125
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.984
you have a question,
feel free to reach out.

126
00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:30.050
There are lots of ways to get
in contact with me online.

127
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.760
I appreciate your time very much.

128
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.960
It's been an honor being here.

129
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.730
You guys have a good evening.
