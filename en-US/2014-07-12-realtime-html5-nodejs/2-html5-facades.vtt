00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.239
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now I'm gonna present
to you just real quickly again because I

3
00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.909
don't want to belabor lots of HTML5.

4
00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:12.833
This is not an HTML5 workshop, but
I want to present to you several APIs

5
00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:17.264
that exist in HTML5, but I'm gonna do so
in a different way than maybe you're used

6
00:00:17.264 --> 00:00:21.033
to seeing because I'm not actually
gonna show you the native APIs.

7
00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:26.114
What I'm going to show you is code
that's using what I call API facades.

8
00:00:26.114 --> 00:00:30.551
Now I have an entire talk on this
particular topic if this is at all

9
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:32.400
Interesting to you.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.450
I'll give you like the two minute blurb on
what a facade is and why it's important.

11
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.779
A facade is an extremely thin layer
of obstruction around a native API.

12
00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:44.020
It is not a poly fill.

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.820
It does not put functionality into
an environment where that functionality

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.480
does not already exist.

15
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.070
It does not add new functionality on top
of the existing APIs for the most part.

16
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.167
It is not terribly concerned with
lots of bug fixes and things.

17
00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:04.608
The main goal of a facade, the main
goal of this thin wrapper API is for

18
00:01:04.608 --> 00:01:08.285
you to have thin layer of
insulation between the code that

19
00:01:08.285 --> 00:01:11.447
you write across your
production application.

20
00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:16.140
And the actual API is that
sometimes develop bugs in them.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.430
Sometimes they change sometimes they
move from not being vendor prefixed

22
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.040
to being vendor prefixed or
the other way around.

23
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.510
Sometimes quirks occur.

24
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.070
And if you have production code that is

25
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.960
using the direct native API
it's all over the place.

26
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.551
Say, for instance, the canvas API or
the local storage API.

27
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:36.911
If you're using those APIs directly and

28
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:39.860
one of the environments
that you're supporting your

29
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.940
production app in changes something
about it, like a bug is introduced.

30
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.470
I don't remember the exact details but
I remember a few months ago there was some

31
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.904
change that [COUGH]
happened with Safari and

32
00:01:50.904 --> 00:01:54.500
their number of concurrent
Ajax requests or something.

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.000
And all of a sudden, production apps
just have to start dealing with

34
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.040
a change to the environment that
they used to be able to run in.

35
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.565
So when those things occur,

36
00:02:02.565 --> 00:02:07.154
if you've been using the native APIs
directly across your whole code base.

37
00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:10.060
You've got a whole bunch
of places to go and fix it.

38
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.299
But if you've been using a facade, the
facade is a place, it's sort of a pressure

39
00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.425
release valve or it's an insulation layer
that allows you to fix that problem.

40
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:22.926
Or fix that bug or whatever that quirk
in one location rather than having to

41
00:02:22.926 --> 00:02:25.720
invalidate the code
across your entire app.

42
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.666
So facades are an incredibly important
thing to be using if you're using these

43
00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:32.919
native APIs directly I encourage
you to rethink that choice.

44
00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.289
Use some sort of facade,

45
00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:38.220
use some sort of frameworks are just
a more complex version of a facade.

46
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.320
Frameworks add all kinds of extra stuff
into it they add in poly fills and

47
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.010
if you're using a framework around
canvas like if you're using D3 or

48
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.780
whatever great no problem.

49
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.534
I'm not gonna complain about
your use of a framework but

50
00:02:50.534 --> 00:02:53.500
if you're using the canvas
API directly anywhere.

51
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.797
You should either be using a facade or
a framework rather than the direct API.

52
00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:03.651
So that's my little two minute spiel
on that and what I'm going to show you

53
00:03:03.651 --> 00:03:08.250
is several of these API using
a facade APIs that I have built.

54
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.002
There's a project that
I built called H5 and

55
00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:14.271
the goal of that was sort of
a community driven thing.

56
00:03:14.271 --> 00:03:18.019
It really hasn't gotten as much
attention as I had hoped it would but

57
00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.031
the goal was for us as a community to
collectively build facade APIs for

58
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:25.600
all of the built in HTML5 APIs
that are available.

59
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.650
Everything from local storage,
to webRTC, to websockets all everything.

60
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.800
I wanted us to build facades for that so

61
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.980
that we could responsibly
use these features now,

62
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.160
but insulate ourselves in case there are
problems or changes or bugs down the road.

63
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.290
And we've probably gotten five or
six of those facades written so

64
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.110
I'm gonna show you some of those today.

65
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.559
But there's, if you go and check out,
it's the project is H with the number 5.

66
00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:56.950
h5ive is the project name and if you go
and check out h5ive on the GitHub repo.

67
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.535
You'll see there's 20 or
30 other APIs already

68
00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:02.640
identified that we need to write
that haven't been written yet.

69
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.736
So, if you'd like to help I would love
that and I've got a contribution guide

70
00:04:06.736 --> 00:04:10.278
there on how to help participate in that,
t's pretty easy stuff.

71
00:04:10.278 --> 00:04:13.662
But I'm [COUGH] I'm gonna show
you some of the facades for

72
00:04:13.662 --> 00:04:16.550
the APIs that I already
use that I've built.
