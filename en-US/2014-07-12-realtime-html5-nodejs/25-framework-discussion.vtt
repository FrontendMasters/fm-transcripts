[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:07.817
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'd be curious about
the answer to the other question.

3
00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:08.960
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: You would.

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.543
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's
basically just trolling.

5
00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.200
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I really do not

6
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.940
understand why anybody is interested
in my opinion on JavaScript frameworks.

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.474
I really don't, but
I'm happy to share my opinion.

8
00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:24.428
This is how I like to
introduce myself by the way,

9
00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:26.070
when I introduce myself to new people.

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.745
I say, the only thing that I'm
an expert on is my own opinions and

11
00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.490
I'm never at a lack for those opinions.

12
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.340
So I'm not an expert on any of this stuff,
this is just I'm figuring it out and

13
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.410
kind of sharing with you what I've
learned with respect to frameworks.

14
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.460
I wrote a blog post last fall that
upset a bunch of people because I had

15
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.810
the nerve to suggest that frameworks in
production are rather a silly concept.

16
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.940
But that doesn't mean that all frameworks
are bad or that there's never a case for

17
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.480
frameworks.

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.350
I just think that they've become too
quickly a crutch that we rely upon

19
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.430
too heavily.

20
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.790
So let me give you
an anecdote to explain that.

21
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.438
Many of you probably heard of
something like Twitter Bootstrap,

22
00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.304
which is a CSS framework.

23
00:01:13.304 --> 00:01:15.692
It's not Bootstrap, is it?

24
00:01:15.692 --> 00:01:16.627
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

25
00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:18.053
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Is it Twitter Bootstrap,
okay.

26
00:01:18.053 --> 00:01:19.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They dropped Twitter though.

27
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.660
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What's that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They dropped Twitter though.

28
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.540
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: They
dropped the Twitter part.

29
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.540
Okay, so Bootstrap, the CSS framework
formerly known as Twitter Bootstrap.

30
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There you go.

31
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.320
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: That's a big giant CSS
file with all kinds of cool styles for

32
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.260
buttons and drop downs and
all kinds of other UI widgets.

33
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.710
Very few user interfaces use
100% of that style sheet.

34
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.420
And so I was sitting around with a
designer friend one night and I was asking

35
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.000
him about this topic and he says yeah
well, I start with the bootstrap CSS.

36
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.780
And I use that to prototype out
my interface cuz it's nice and

37
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.530
fast and whatever.

38
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.540
But at the end of
the process of prototyping,

39
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.870
once I've decided what my page
is gonna look like, I go in and

40
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.080
I rip out all the stuff out of that
file that I don't need anymore.

41
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.580
And I only deploy part of that file,
the part that's actually necessary.

42
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.230
And a little light bulb went on in my head
because that seemed like a good way to

43
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.500
articulate my problem with frameworks.

44
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.656
Because I think that's the same thing that
we should be doing with our JavaScript

45
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:15.320
frameworks.

46
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.480
We should be using them
to rapidly prototype and

47
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.570
develop applications in a space where
we don't understand the domain yet.

48
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.380
We're still trying to figure things
out and we don't want to be held back

49
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.150
by trying to figure out, you know,
console statements or whatever.

50
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.770
We want the logging to
already be handled for us.

51
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.340
But by the point that you have evolved
your app to the point where you

52
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.270
are ready to consider it production ready,

53
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.530
you're ready to start charging people
money to use your application.

54
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.270
I think you should have gone through a
series of steps where you asked yourself,

55
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.390
what parts of the stuff that I've
deployed am I not even using anymore?

56
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.280
There's a bunch of stuff in this
framework that I'm not even using.

57
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.810
And shouldn't I just go ahead and rip
out all the stuff that I'm not using and

58
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.520
leave only the stuff
that is actually my app?

59
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240
That's exactly what I did with the Mario
site, we used some frameworks like

60
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.200
Backbone and some other things to kind
of skeleton out what we were gonna do.

61
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.080
But when we deployed the app I
kind of tongue in cheek I said,

62
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.930
when I deployed the app by
the time we went to production.

63
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.610
I had written a framework for the site and
I just called the framework, the site.

64
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.500
Because I left only the code
that was necessary for

65
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.550
the site and not all this extra stuff.

66
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.762
So that's my somewhat controversial
perspective on frameworks is

67
00:03:27.762 --> 00:03:31.438
that I don't feel that they're really
as necessary as most people believe.

68
00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:36.470
I can find individual major problems with
each one of them, but everybody can.

69
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.310
And I think that we rely
too heavily on them.

70
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.131
I'd like to see more people
leaving only what's necessary and

71
00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:46.389
not leaving all the extra cruft,
so that's my take.

72
00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:51.647
Okay, let's see, we've written our server,
let me double check and

73
00:03:51.647 --> 00:03:57.006
make sure there's nothing else that
I wanted us write for forward.js.

74
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.108
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But
would you say the same thing about jQuery?

75
00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:08.370
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
jQuery in my book's not a framework and

76
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.640
that's another common misconception.

77
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.750
Let me give you an, I use jQuery.

78
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:20.520
I don't use all of it, I use a tiny
portion of it, but I use jQuery.

79
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.770
Here's my little metaphor for

80
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.540
understanding the difference between
a library, a framework, and a platform.

81
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.250
And I have very different opinions
on the usage of libraries

82
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.020
versus frameworks versus platforms.

83
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.870
A library is like one of those old school.

84
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.740
Some of you may never even heard of them.

85
00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.427
But we used to have maps that were
printed on paper that we folded out and

86
00:04:43.427 --> 00:04:44.749
we kept in our glove box.

87
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:46.459
And I don't know if some of
you are looking at me like,

88
00:04:46.459 --> 00:04:47.920
I've never heard of such a thing.

89
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.350
But old school paper maps that we had
folded up inside of our glove box.

90
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.670
A library to me is like
an old school paper map

91
00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.350
that you would take when you were going
on a road trip across the country.

92
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.060
It is a tool that is available to you,
but it is not in any way, shape or

93
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.845
form opinionated on how you should
get from point A to point B.

94
00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:10.555
It's tool that you can use, and it can be
quite useful to you if you're getting lost

95
00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:13.417
or you need to understand what
the routes look like or the roads or

96
00:05:13.417 --> 00:05:14.277
things like that.

97
00:05:14.277 --> 00:05:17.585
But it's a tool that you use along
the way, and that's the metaphor for

98
00:05:17.585 --> 00:05:18.149
a library.

99
00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:22.850
And I lump things like jQuery
into the library perspective.

100
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.356
Some of Backbone is library-esque, and

101
00:05:26.356 --> 00:05:31.292
some of Backbone is more framework-esque,
so that kind of straddles the fence.

102
00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:35.035
But jQuery is very much a library to me.

103
00:05:35.035 --> 00:05:40.583
The metaphor for frameworks that I use
is it's like a GPS system in your car or

104
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:43.370
on your phone or something like that.

105
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.998
Where you've pre-typed
in your destination and

106
00:05:45.998 --> 00:05:48.883
it's gonna give you audible
turn by turn directions.

107
00:05:48.883 --> 00:05:51.040
That is a rather opinionated system.

108
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.880
It has an opinion on the best route for

109
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.700
you to get there based upon what it knows
about traffic conditions and so forth.

110
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.770
You're not required to follow that route.

111
00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.890
If you follow a different route, if you
take a different turn either on purpose or

112
00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.130
by accident, it recalculates and
it figures out a new thing.

113
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.820
So it's a tool that's
helping you along the way.

114
00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.482
But it's also giving you its opinion
on the way you ought to do things.

115
00:06:09.482 --> 00:06:13.890
And I think that fits most closely
metaphorically with frameworks.

116
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.740
A platform is like an automatic
driving Google car.

117
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.410
Because it has a strong opinion
on where it's gonna go,

118
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.590
and you have very little
say-so in the matter.

119
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.040
You're just gonna go along with the flow.

120
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:29.870
So if you're looking for sort of
a metaphor of how I divide those things,

121
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.590
I think about things like Ember and
Angular and things like that.

122
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.190
Those are very clearly frameworks to me.

123
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.230
They're very opinionated.

124
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.930
It's a very strong guidance in
the way you ought to go with your app.

125
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.545
Something like jQuery or
even some parts of Backbone,

126
00:06:42.545 --> 00:06:43.920
they're a lot less opinionated.

127
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.870
It's more just provide you the tools and
so

128
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.330
they're a little bit more like libraries.

129
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.630
And then something like Rails,

130
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:54.660
quite clearly that's a platform, because
you've got to do it the Rails way or

131
00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.100
they're not interested in any other
[LAUGH] ways of doing things.

132
00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.790
So that's just my take.

133
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We'll be doing
a whole workshop on this.

134
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.741
July 13th we'll be doing a compare and

135
00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:12.696
contrast of all the different
UI frameworks, Ember,

136
00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:15.723
Backbone, Facebook React and.

137
00:07:15.723 --> 00:07:17.420
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Sounds
like a fantastic workshop.

138
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.600
You should all definitely make
sure to attend or watch it.
