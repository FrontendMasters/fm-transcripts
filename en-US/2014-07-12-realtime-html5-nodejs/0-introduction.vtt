2
00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:41.680
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Welcome
back everyone to day 2.

3
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.980
I always love seeing the substantially
the same amount of faces on day 2,

4
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.100
means I haven't scared anybody away or
bored anybody to tears.

5
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.860
So, at least we're somewhere in
the middle, being tolerable.

6
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.819
I also hear there is quite a few of
you still in the online stream, so

7
00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:57.754
that's good.

8
00:00:57.754 --> 00:01:01.988
Just as a super quick review for
anybody that's joining us new today,

9
00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:04.630
either in person or online.

10
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.110
I just wanted to make
sure you know who I am.

11
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.420
I am Kyle Simpson known as getify online.

12
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.990
So if you wanna find anything about me,
you can check out my Twitter account there

13
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.280
or the getify.me website
will list everything,

14
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.840
every link that there is to
anything about me publicly.

15
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.900
So you can check that stuff out.

16
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.850
I am independently employed.

17
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.430
I basically for my full time job,
if you will, I teach.

18
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.320
So I travel all over the world
teaching workshops like

19
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960
the one you've been attending.

20
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.550
Teach them both publicly,
kind of like these.

21
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.620
I also teach corporately.

22
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.010
So if you or your company or
your group would like to hire me and

23
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.960
bring me in to train,
I would love to do that.

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.840
So, feel free to do that.

25
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.200
In the time that I'm not
actually working and

26
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.880
training, I do a lot in
the open source world.

27
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.880
So I spend a lot of time doing
open source development.

28
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.980
These are some projects
that I've worked on.

29
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.270
LABjs is a script loader,
grips is a templating engine.

30
00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.540
Asynquence which we'll get into today,
again, we talked about yesterday as well,

31
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.280
is a asynchronous flow control kind
of promises like abstraction library.

32
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.370
I do a lot of conference speaking,

33
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.950
these are some of the conference
talks that I've given.

34
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.440
There's [COUGH] videos and

35
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.240
slides and audio recordings of all these
talks from last five or six years.

36
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.630
All up online, you can check out on
speakerdeck or on my lanyard account.

37
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.850
And lastly, I [COUGH] have a series
of books that I've been writing

38
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.450
called You Don't Know JavaScript.

39
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.440
The first one was published
a couple of weeks ago.

40
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
That's called Scope and Closures and
that's available for purchase now.

41
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.170
The second one is going into editing or
it's actually already in editing.

42
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.340
It should be finishing
editing pretty soon.

43
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.760
And being published hopefully
within the next few weeks.

44
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.860
That one's called This and
Object Prototypes.

45
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.870
But so both of those were the major topics
that we spent most of yesterday on.

46
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.494
And if you'd like a book that
expounds on that in great detail,

47
00:02:53.494 --> 00:02:55.740
both those books are great to check out.

48
00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.320
Also, the entire series, there's
expected five titles in the series,

49
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.480
the whole thing is being written
completely open and free up on GitHub.

50
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.850
So YouDontKnowJS.com will
redirect to the GitHub repo

51
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.400
where all of these writings are.

52
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.960
And I encourage you to check that out and
follow along with the writing,

53
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.920
participate, submit poll requests, submit
issues if you think there are things

54
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.540
that I need to cover more clearly,
or things like that.

55
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.227
So it's actually a community
driven sort of project, and

56
00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:24.892
I really am doing this because I want
people to that are great developers,

57
00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:27.920
that are smart people
that understand things.

58
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.210
I want you to see what it actually takes
to write a book and hopefully that will

59
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.480
empower more people to write better books,
and to write more things in the open.

60
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.640
So the whole process is
being open sourced including

61
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.550
my editor submits review
comments directly on GitHub.

62
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.070
So you can see everything about
the process and what it looks like.

63
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.060
The other stuff you don't see is
like the contract negotiations.

64
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.920
That stuff you gotta do privately,
but other than that,

65
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.970
you can see the whole
process from start to finish.

66
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.250
So, check those things out.
