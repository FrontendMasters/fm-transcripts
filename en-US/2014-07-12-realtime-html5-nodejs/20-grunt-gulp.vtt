00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:06.500
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: One other thing
I just want to briefly touch on.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.980
There were a couple of you that mentioned
in the pre event surveys that you were

4
00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:10.650
interested in.

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.629
We're not going to dive much
more into this ecosystem, but

6
00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.760
I do just want to kind of briefly mention
so it's sort of you're aware of it.

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.390
There are a couple of tools
that you may have heard

8
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.160
of that are pretty popular these days.

9
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.500
One of them is called Grunt,
the other one is called Gulp.

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.210
And in fact, there's other ones,
I think there's one called Broccoli, and

11
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.200
some other ones.

12
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.040
Essentially what these tools are,
are a way to,

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.130
in the node tooling ecosystem,
to run build processes.

14
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.220
So we all talk about build processes.

15
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.340
Things like Browserify,
that's a build process.

16
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.668
Running a Linter on your code,
that's a build process step.

17
00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:51.770
Minifying your code,
concatenating your code, transpired-

18
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.279
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a whole course on

19
00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:53.880
that.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What's that?

20
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.023
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: David Mosher did

21
00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:57.411
a whole course on Grunt.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, so

22
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:02.311
you should go look at the Frontend Masters
videos for build processes,

23
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:03.955
perfect.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

24
00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:05.019
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: There you go.

25
00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.850
So we're not going to spend
a lot of time talking about it.

26
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.143
But I just wanted to orient you to kind of
the mindset behind that kind of argument

27
00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:15.500
between Grunt and Gulp.

28
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.950
Grunt is a configuration based approach.

29
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.760
So you create a configuration
file that specifies,

30
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.700
kind of declaratively, the steps that you
want to have happen in your build process.

31
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.970
And we won't go into
exactly the format of it.

32
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.860
But Grunt came out before Gulp, long
before Gulp, and it got really popular.

33
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.440
A lot of people provided Grunt
files along with their modules.

34
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.980
And then Gulp came along and said, what if
I don't want to do configuration based?

35
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.320
What if I just want to
write the code myself?

36
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.360
I want to do it explicitly
with function calls.

37
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.930
So it's a way of dealing with streams and
piping and

38
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.856
things like that in kind of
a very natural node like way,

39
00:01:55.856 --> 00:01:59.240
with literally almost no
configuration whatsoever.

40
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.140
They're just, in my opinion,
two different sides of the same coin.

41
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.890
I don't really think that one is
fundamentally different or better.

42
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.320
But they're just two different
ways to approach the same task,

43
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.270
which is we want to express the steps that
we need to take in our build processes.

44
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.000
And if you didn't like any of those,
you could go back to using Bash scripts or

45
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.960
make files, or any of the thousand
other options that are out there.

46
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.097
So, I just wanted to share that Grunt and

47
00:02:25.097 --> 00:02:29.436
Gulp are kind of node centric
tools in that build process

48
00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:35.972
environment.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Several

49
00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:39.400
of my little side projects,
I still use Grunt.

50
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.500
It doesn't mean that Gulp is bad, it just
means that I learned Grunt first, so.
