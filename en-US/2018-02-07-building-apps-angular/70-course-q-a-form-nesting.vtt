00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: If you have a nest of
multiple form groups, can you do that?

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.509
You have form controls and
then you have form group and

3
00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.950
then you have parent FormGroups.

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.922
So when do you that do you nest in DIVs,
like you put in

5
00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:16.041
DIVs onto input containers?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

6
00:00:16.041 --> 00:00:20.268
your HTML structure is not bound So

7
00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:26.245
ideally your form would
model your form group and

8
00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:29.470
everything inside of it.

9
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.370
But, you could lay it
out however you want.

10
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.173
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: But do work or

11
00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:37.225
do you have to put the FormGroup?

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.640
On every element inside it.

13
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.984
So if I want to give like say there
was username and password, right?

14
00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:47.542
And I have wanted a FormGroup,
different form groups for username and

15
00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:50.170
different FormGroup for password, okay?

16
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.190
And the tool FormGroup as login, okay?

17
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.451
So I have one FormGroup
called as login and

18
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:57.370
then I have second FormGroup
called as username.

19
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.310
And in username I have first name and
last name.

20
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.275
And password I have in the password.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I would probably grab,

21
00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:08.341
if I have a group, let's say I have,
let's think of it this way.

22
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:10.719
You have user name, password, and

23
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:15.090
you might have another
FormGroup with like an address.

24
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.130
It's a logical division of the model.

25
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.660
The I would probably, one,
put them in two separate FormGroups.

26
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.167
Which then live in the top
level FormGroup, and

27
00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:28.118
I would probably wrap those in a DIV.

28
00:01:28.118 --> 00:01:30.835
So each FormGroup would get a DIV and
I would do form group name and

29
00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:32.671
put that in there.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, and so there's only

30
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:33.730
one form on the page, as such.

31
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:34.350
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay.
