00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.680
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
I am going to pull up the challenge and

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.595
we can do a freeze frame on this and
so I am going to leave you with this.

3
00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:11.090
And this is, in a sense,
what I have just done.

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.536
So I think we are at a good spot.

5
00:00:12.536 --> 00:00:18.480
And what I would like everybody to do,
is just

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.310
sometime this evening, go back through and
try to re-implement what I've done.

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.240
So from event, map.

8
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.266
So you use map, play around with that
filter and then more importantly,

9
00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.464
bufferTime distinctUntilChanged and
switchMap.

10
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.840
Now granted, everything I'm asking you to
do, I've done in five lines approximately.

11
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.820
And so this will be kind of
the final module for today.

12
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.700
Does anybody have any questions about
what we've covered in the last two days?

13
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.930
We can talk about the meaning of life to,

14
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.340
why I write the code the way I do,
Angular, whatever you would like, but

15
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.650
I'll be available for probably the next 24
hours, you can at least get a hold of me.

16
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:14.926
Just kidding.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Well

17
00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:20.310
if nobody has anything to that end,
again thank you for an awesome day two.

18
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.040
Thank you everyone online,
you're awesome as always.

19
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.410
And see everybody tomorrow for day three.

20
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.230
Please do try to do this homework, this to
me is super powerful and very exciting.
