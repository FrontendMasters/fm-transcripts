&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That is about
is a much as I want to cover today,

2
00:00:03.633 --> 00:00:04.889
I'm exhausted.

3
00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:08.635
So, to that end, I love you guys very
much, you've been super awesome.

4
00:00:08.635 --> 00:00:11.340
Everybody in the chat room, love you.

5
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.223
I will say this, I tried to be as
responsive as absolutely possible,

6
00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:21.260
especially if you've taken the time
to come and be in a workshop.

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.740
And we spent three days together.

8
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.408
That there's a certain level of
camaraderie that comes with that.

9
00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:32.475
Please reach out to me at anytime,
@simpulton, I accept DMs.

10
00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.293
So, if you're ever like, hey,
I don't understand what you said here or

11
00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:40.600
I had this question, catch me on Twitter
and then we can take it from there.

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.284
So, please, reach out to me.

13
00:00:43.284 --> 00:00:46.330
And to that end, thank you so much.

14
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.849
It's been a fantastic three days and

15
00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:52.353
hopefully you are excited
about what you learned.

16
00:00:52.353 --> 00:00:57.311
And my goal is not that you got
everything in these three days, but

17
00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:01.745
on Monday you're excited to
keep playing around with it.

18
00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:04.212
And you have great, thank you and

19
00:01:04.212 --> 00:01:05.893
