00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.670
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: So yesterday in
template driven forms we learned

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.970
that there's kind of two main things
that have to happen with a form.

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.190
So one, we have to keep track of the data

4
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.930
driving the form as well as
the state of the form meaning is

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.440
it in a valid state and
why or why not, is it?

6
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.050
So what happened?

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.110
Is something required or
do we have password requirements or

8
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.990
whatever that will be keeping track of
the data and the validity of the form?

9
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:41.310
And we saw by referencing NG model and
NG form that under the hood,

10
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.810
we have this hierarchy of
things that is being inserted

11
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.810
behind the scenes into our form
that's keeping track of all this.

12
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.100
And so to kind of walk through this
again in review, we have a form control

13
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.910
that tracks the value and
validation of an individual FormControl.

14
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.700
So if we have an input,
there's a FormControl for that.

15
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.500
Select box, radio box.

16
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.510
Anything that is a FormControl,
it gets a FormControl.

17
00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.390
I see what they did there.

18
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.740
Now, you can actually
group these together.

19
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.927
And so, not surprisingly,
this is a FormGroup.

20
00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:31.390
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: FormGroup
is something that is JavaScript.

21
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.040
And you work with it in
the JavaScript context.

22
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.330
But youâ€™ll use the FormGroup
directive to bind

23
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.250
that FormGroup that you declared to a DOM
element, so we'll see this in a moment.

24
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.050
So you have a FormGroup but
you need to actually bind it to the form.

25
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.510
So this is a step that did not
exist with template driven forms.

26
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.870
In this case, we're saying we are going
to explicitly declare our FormGroup.

27
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.630
And then we're going to explicitly,

28
00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.850
using the FormGroup directive,
bind it to this form.

29
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.730
Now what you will also do is,

30
00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.240
say I have this FormControl
that I defined in my FormGroup.

31
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.000
So the first two,
FormControl and FormGroup, these

32
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.690
are the things that we actually define in
our JavaScript in the imperative context.

33
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.882
And on the element we now say,

34
00:02:21.882 --> 00:02:26.618
I need to bind this
control to this element.

35
00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:31.838
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: And so really the
difference here in kinda template driven

36
00:02:31.838 --> 00:02:34.222
forms to reactive is in
template driven forms,

37
00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:36.739
everything is just happening
behind the scenes.

38
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.260
Other then setting a local
template variable,

39
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.110
you generally do not interact with the
form group or the form control directly.

40
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.010
With reactive forms,
you have complete access to that.

41
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.040
And it's pulled out,

42
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.080
put back into your class and
then you use that to wire to your forum.

43
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.600
So you're kinda just inverting
the control a little bit.

44
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.570
And so FormGroup directive, FormControl
name binds FormControls and FormGroups.

45
00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.040
Then, there's one more piece,
which is called FormBuilder.

46
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.610
And so this is essentially
syntactic sugar that just allows us

47
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.050
to kinda build up larger forms quickly.

48
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.990
So you can say I have a group, and I have
a contol and I have an array, and so

49
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.710
different things.

50
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.820
Let's just put it all together
into one big FormGroup and

51
00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.090
we'll use FormBuilder to do this.

52
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.470
So this is just a convenient
mechanism to do this.

53
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.420
So let's see the simplest version of this,
so we'll start with a simple version,

54
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.940
and then we'll go to a simple-ish version.
