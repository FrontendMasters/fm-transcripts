1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.280
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: So
let's just do a real quick test.

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.540
We'll just kind of see this working.

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.720
It's actually gonna take just a couple
of minutes and then we can move on.

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.990
And I'll keep talking
until our fries get here.

5
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.626
Tanner, are they coming?

6
00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:15.362
Yeah!

7
00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.222
[LAUGH]

8
00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:18.910
&gt;&gt; Student: I'm
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Man.

9
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.660
You know what, that is amazing
when the owner of a multi-billion

10
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.140
dollar corporation will go get his
fries and he's running no less.

11
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.910
&gt;&gt; Student: He might eat them all though.

12
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.801
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Yeah,

13
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.627
because metabolism.

14
00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:36.560
I don't know.

15
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.130
All right ironically fries component spec,
this is appropriate.

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.970
So here I'm just going to
set title equals crack fries

17
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:53.180
are a thing okay?

18
00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.470
Now if I go into my spec,
I'm also going to

19
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.330
define a debug element and
down here, I'll just go ahead

20
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.280
and fixture.debugElement.

21
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.930
So I think it kind of depends if I were
to adjust this blueprint a little bit.

22
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.418
I'd probably would add in
the debug element by default but

23
00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:34.338
with that said, let's say it should have

24
00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:40.124
a title.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: And

25
00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:43.936
we expect component.title,

26
00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:51.120
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: To be hello.

27
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.870
That's not what I said.

28
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.450
What was I thinking?

29
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.838
I've got to pick something
that I didn't even,

30
00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:09.392
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: All right,

31
00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:12.040
luck be a lady.

32
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.110
It's gonna run, boom.

33
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.640
Good, I feel good about myself.

34
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.720
Let me do one thing real quick.

35
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.120
So I had this in the other component,
let me just make this an h1.

36
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.505
There we go and we'll just set this to

37
00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:38.732
title.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: All right,

38
00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:47.075
back into our spec.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: It

39
00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:53.659
should display title.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: And

40
00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.478
we'll go cost h1 =,

41
00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:15.360
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: I think this is right.

42
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.751
I'm missing by and we

43
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:31.751
expect(h1.nativeElement.el).

44
00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.570
Was it element or?
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Cheating a little bit.

45
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.226
I didn't want to do this, innerText, okay.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Just for the record

46
00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:51.370
as well, I will admit that I generally
do not make it a point to memorize APIs.

47
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.750
Because you have things like,
you may not have known this, but

48
00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.020
you can actually use the angular
CLI to pull up documentation.

49
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.970
So for instance I can go NG help, or

50
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.020
there's some command you
can say like debug element.

51
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.870
It will actually open up the browser for
you.

52
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.130
What I've done is I actually
have it hooked into Alfred.

53
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.990
So NG doc.

54
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.550
Debugelement, so
I don't know how this works.

55
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:19.320
I'm not gonna memorize it.

56
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.100
You just have it in here.

57
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.760
So just a heads up that
if you're using Alfred,

58
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.070
you can actually set up custom
kinda queries to do that.

59
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.874
So enter text, toBe and
this is going to be the same

60
00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:40.085
value here.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: So

61
00:04:40.085 --> 00:04:42.623
now we're actually making
sure that it's rendering in

62
00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:46.710
the template.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: I hope this works.

63
00:04:52.894 --> 00:04:54.499
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Yeah.

64
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.100
All right, so
let's see the detect changes one.

65
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.654
So it should update a title.

66
00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.214
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: We'll go here, and

67
00:05:11.214 --> 00:05:17.989
I'm just going to copy this over.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: And

68
00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:23.884
now let's go,
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Component.title,

69
00:05:29.455 --> 00:05:30.012
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: I'm going to change

70
00:05:30.012 --> 00:05:36.899
this.
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: And

71
00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:42.640
now we expect enter text

72
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.256
to be with chilli.

73
00:05:47.256 --> 00:05:54.690
And no, so we can look in here,
it's still expecting it to be this.

74
00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.410
The reason being is because we
have not rendered the templates.

75
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.723
So you can see here we're calling
it fixture.detectchanges().

76
00:06:02.723 --> 00:06:08.255
If we go here, fixture.detectchanges().

77
00:06:18.572 --> 00:06:19.980
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Boom, so this is,

78
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.320
I think a really good kind of intro
to how to test the components.

79
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.061
Fortunately for us the majority
of it has been done for us.

80
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:34.140
So, all the set up is here.

81
00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:41.160
Like I was able start writing test
immediately, which is quit nice.
