00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.120
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're gonna do
this one just slightly different.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.510
In the fact that we're going
to have a challenge but

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.760
I want to service it as soon as possible
so we can kind of follow along.

4
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.370
And as I'm kind of doing this, that you
can kind of type along and code with me.

5
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.570
So we're gonna do this a little bit more
play by play, a little bit together.

6
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.420
So, first thing's first.

7
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.604
Go ahead and we're going to
create an ItemsSearch component.

8
00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:32.949
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then what I
want you to do is just add that

9
00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.540
to the HomeComponent template.

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.656
And from there go to this bit.ly link and
just start pulling things out,

11
00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:41.804
dropping it in.

12
00:00:44.647 --> 00:00:48.224
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so I'll leave this
up until everybody gets the bit.ly link up

13
00:00:48.224 --> 00:00:50.449
and then I will go ahead and do it myself.

14
00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.841
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What this is going to
do is save us an extra 20 minutes from

15
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:01.963
having to go through and
create a totally brand new component

16
00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.839
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So does everybody have

17
00:01:17.839 --> 00:01:19.540
the bit.ly link?

18
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.600
So what I would do is actually just jump
to the end, put that in the browser.

19
00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.701
And then once everybody has it set up,
I'll actually pull my computer up and

20
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:26.772
we'll do this together.

21
00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.013
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So give me one
second while I do my own Pre Challenge.

22
00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:38.719
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Items search snippets.

23
00:01:41.025 --> 00:01:42.657
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,
it's all here, thank goodness.

24
00:01:45.444 --> 00:01:46.292
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

25
00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:53.559
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: ng g c.

26
00:01:57.622 --> 00:01:58.924
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If I
type something stupid,

27
00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:03.711
please,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Call me out.

28
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:04.895
items-search.

29
00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:10.658
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: How does this look,
good?

30
00:02:10.658 --> 00:02:11.980
I think this is what I had in my notes.

31
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.140
I don't know, we'll see.

32
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:22.855
All right, then we'll go to
the home.component, we'll add this in.

33
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.575
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And then from here,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We

34
00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:44.972
just fill the center real quick.

35
00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:52.208
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Mistake or what?

36
00:02:55.264 --> 00:02:56.296
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Good.

37
00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:11.548
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And one more step,
and then I think we are good to go.

38
00:03:23.518 --> 00:03:24.628
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's check this out.

39
00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.208
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right, so, great,
we have the site of the search component

40
00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:41.880
and we are going to wire this up and
do some interesting things using durables.
