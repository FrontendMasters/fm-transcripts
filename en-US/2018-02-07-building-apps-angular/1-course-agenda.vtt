00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.000
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
so, here's the agenda.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.145
I'm going to talk about the demo
application just real quick, so

3
00:00:05.145 --> 00:00:06.581
we can see what it looks like.

4
00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:11.160
Then this is going to
be the longest module.

5
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.560
But I'm going to just from a high level,
talk about the big picture, and

6
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.860
what are the big pieces in Angular and
how do they fit together.

7
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.850
So for me when I start to, I'm picking
up a book or a textbook especially,

8
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.260
I like to look at the table of contents
and just say, what are we going to cover.

9
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.819
And so this is kind of the condensed
version, and then we'll spend the rest

10
00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:35.567
of the workshop over the next couple
of days, unpacking it, getting into it.

11
00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:39.057
So I would expect at the end of
that first module, by the end,

12
00:00:39.057 --> 00:00:43.096
eyes are gonna be glazed over and
everybody is gonna go get a doughnut,

13
00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:47.911
take a deep breath, and then we'll come
back and actually start writing the code.

14
00:00:47.911 --> 00:00:52.022
So just a forewarning that, into the big
picture we're just going to get a high

15
00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:56.342
level view, talk about a lot of concepts
but then we'll start to break that down.

16
00:00:56.342 --> 00:01:01.332
Then we're gonna do a quick intro to
the Angular CLI, and then we're gonna get

17
00:01:01.332 --> 00:01:07.270
right into components, templates,
services, and template driven forms.

18
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.090
And I think that will set the foundation
for how do we build a feature in Angular.
