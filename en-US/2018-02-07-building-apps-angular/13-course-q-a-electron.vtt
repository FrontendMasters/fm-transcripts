&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,
let me real quick address a question about

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.650
the different build
environments such as electron.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.442
So one of the things the CLI does
that I think is quite nice is,

4
00:00:11.442 --> 00:00:17.585
if you go into your source environments,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Folder,

5
00:00:17.585 --> 00:00:22.874
you can actually define, basically the
different environments you wanna target

6
00:00:22.874 --> 00:00:27.630
and then start to build out essentially
a pipeline for that environment.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.983
And so if you wanna do electron,

8
00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:34.450
then you could basically create
an electron environment.

9
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.564
Drop it in here and then when you do
build, you could do, entry build and

10
00:00:38.564 --> 00:00:40.890
then set your electron flag.

11
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.400
And then, depending on how you set it up,
it would basically mix that to taste.

12
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.813
And so we have, basically,
production development,

13
00:00:51.813 --> 00:00:56.887
but you can extend this out to infinity,
if you wanted.
