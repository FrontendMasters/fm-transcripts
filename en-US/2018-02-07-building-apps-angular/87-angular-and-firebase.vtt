00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.010
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We have hung out for

2
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.550
three days to realize
this last 20 minutes.

3
00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.400
This is the bonus module.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.795
So what I'm going to do here, and
I haven't quite figured out because

5
00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:18.640
I actually checked my config in,
and I tried to like write it back.

6
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.050
And I don't know, whatever.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.965
Let me go back here, let me just
delete this stuff, Move to Trash,

8
00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:32.600
discard all changes and so I'm just
hopping to the example fire brace branch.

9
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.940
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's
go back over here.

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.800
Make sure everything is compiling.

11
00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.055
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And if it does,
then we'll have something to talk about.

12
00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:50.350
Big surprise here, right?

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.390
The big 92.

14
00:00:56.104 --> 00:00:59.210
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

15
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.350
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
let's see if I can get this to work first.

16
00:01:13.775 --> 00:01:23.229
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now pay attention.

17
00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.994
If this is going to work,

18
00:01:25.994 --> 00:01:31.280
what you're going to see
is the stack bar here.

19
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.590
More importantly,
you're going to see it over here.

20
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.360
So direct your eyes over here.

21
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.230
While everybody is looking over here I'm
going to steal all of your wallets, and

22
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.820
your watches.

23
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.058
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: JK!

24
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.320
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
that's realtime, homie.

25
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.478
Let's talk about how I did this.

26
00:01:49.478 --> 00:01:55.940
Surprisingly simple,
I would almost say sleight of hand.

27
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.450
Well, let's do one more because
I never get sick of this.

28
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.130
Let's go here.

29
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.680
Items.

30
00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:07.346
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Items saved.

31
00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:13.020
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Pretty neat.

32
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.070
So how are we doing this?
