&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I think
it's time to do a challenge.

2
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.500
So I've already done the demonstration.

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.160
What I would like everybody to
do is in your widgets component,

4
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.950
essentially I want to create
a form with a save and

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.700
cancel button, populate the form
with your selected widget, and

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.940
then using ngForm, add in some validation
for editing the widget component.

7
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:26.600
Now, if you use the item detail

8
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.580
component as a reference, some of
the stuff is going to be done for you.

9
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.790
So you're just already going
to have the buttons created.

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.710
I would like you to hook them
into the component class.

11
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.050
So in other words,
when I click Save or Cancel,

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.270
I actually call a method on the class.

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.840
So actually wired up to the best and
fullest extent of your ability.
