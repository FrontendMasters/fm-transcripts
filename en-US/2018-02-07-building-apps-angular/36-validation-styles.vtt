00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.830
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There are some
validation styles that Angular is

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.300
automatically producing and attaching
to an element, if it's valid or not.

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.760
So the four big ones are ng-valid,
ng-invalid, ng-pristine and ng-untouched.

4
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.430
So valid, invalid,
obviously I think that makes sense.

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.510
Pristine is, is it in a clean position
like is it the way that we found it?

6
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.610
Untouched is have you
ever touched it at all?

7
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.099
The reason being is if a form element
is empty but a user hasn't touched it,

8
00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:36.966
then you would not want
to run validation on it.

9
00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:42.009
So a lot of times you wanna
say if it is untouched,

10
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:47.550
if you're saying should I
show this required error?

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.410
A lot of times you'll actually work is
this required, so is the form valid?

12
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.990
And has the form been touched?

13
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.230
Cuz if it hasn't, then don't run
validation til they've actually started

14
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.630
to work with it, and so
that's where that comes in.

15
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.268
And so, here you could just say
like if it's an invalid state,

16
00:01:08.268 --> 00:01:12.270
maybe I wanna put a green border on or
something.

17
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.199
So you can actually attach these in, and

18
00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.623
control how the element renders based
on this valid and invalid state.

19
00:01:17.623 --> 00:01:21.592
So this is something Angular
is doing under the hood that,

20
00:01:21.592 --> 00:01:25.646
it's just happening automatically
that you can tap into.

21
00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:30.861
In fact, so you can even see in the demo,
we go over here,

22
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:35.756
that notice when I take this
away because it's saying

23
00:01:35.756 --> 00:01:40.910
limitary it's already attaching
kind of a style to it.

24
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.240
And if I go here,
we'll see what comes to this.

25
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.580
Let me just zoom this in right here.

26
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.530
You can see it's automatically added
ng-touched, it's dirty and it's invalid.

27
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.800
So if I went back, so
let me just zoom this back down.

28
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.470
Yes, so I think it's this one.

29
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.197
It's a little bit hard to see but
as I start to type this in,

30
00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:18.505
you can see now it's valid.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But

31
00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:22.726
if you are to refresh the page,
it's empty and

32
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:26.340
it's valid but not touched.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Right, so

33
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.275
it hasn't been touched.

34
00:02:27.275 --> 00:02:29.390
[LAUGH] I guess I just,

35
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.598
well let's see how this registers.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

36
00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:37.240
I have touched it and
it's now in invalid state.

37
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.800
But had I not, so
the minute I touched it it's like so

38
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.970
there's a bit kind of subsequency you'll
play around with depending on your needs.

39
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Does this for the form,

40
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.418
complete form or it's only for
the control level or form level?

41
00:02:51.418 --> 00:02:55.460
Control level, right?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes,

42
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.120
so these run, let's see here.

43
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.050
So it's on the form level as well, equally

44
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.960
interesting.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

45
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.186
it's an R float everything-
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

46
00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:17.071
you could do the validation so
watch, so the minute I touch this

47
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:21.850
form,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

48
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:31.368
that did not change, but this down here,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did.

49
00:03:31.368 --> 00:03:32.744
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It is changing on the form.

50
00:03:32.744 --> 00:03:33.569
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah.

51
00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:37.041
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So before

52
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.195
you
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: No,

53
00:03:39.195 --> 00:03:42.567
it does not change at the form level,
on the touching of,

54
00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:45.710
it's still engine cached.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But

55
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.120
why would it be?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now, so you have to

56
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.300
focus south, the menu you focus south.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

57
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.450
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So we can kind of go

58
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.140
down, and we're dancing here,
you know what?

59
00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.588
But a lot of times, so Todd Mato, he has
some really good articles on Todd Motto,

60
00:04:00.588 --> 00:04:03.400
on reactive forms.

61
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.670
And he has a really good post
on doing reactive forms.

62
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.309
And if you look at the validation
section of that, it's a lot of like,

63
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.350
if it's invalid and
it has been touched, show the error.

64
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.398
And so that's a pretty good example of
like, if this plus this, then show it.

65
00:04:19.398 --> 00:04:21.983
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So when you refreshed at

66
00:04:21.983 --> 00:04:27.470
the very beginning,
the form state is invalid.

67
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.976
So it hasn't been,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Where's

68
00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:36.156
the form?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,

69
00:04:36.156 --> 00:04:39.360
right there, untouched,
pristine, and invalid.

70
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.080
So until you make an action on it,

71
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.063
it's just saying, it hasn't been validated
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

72
00:04:48.063 --> 00:04:51.466
I would need to actually
look at the source code but

73
00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:55.518
there is some determination of,
if nobody's touched it,

74
00:04:55.518 --> 00:04:59.990
this is- It starts as an invalid
form cuz it hasn't been filled.
