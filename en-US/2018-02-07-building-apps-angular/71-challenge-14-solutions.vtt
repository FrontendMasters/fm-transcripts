WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.228
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm
trying to do this by memory.

2
00:00:02.228 --> 00:00:07.040
We'll import, so
we'll start with the stuff that I know.

3
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.400
We're definitely gonna need this.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.212
And let's go with

5
00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:23.385
login = new FormGroup.

6
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:26.940
Now if I do something crazy,
just call me out.

7
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.830
As in, I'm missing a parentheses?

8
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.614
Ha, or not, what's going on here?

9
00:00:40.628 --> 00:00:44.466
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Uh-huh, actually,
hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

10
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:46.280
I don't think I instantiated here.

11
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.180
Help me out, class.

12
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.977
I think I just-
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Say FormGroup.

13
00:00:51.977 --> 00:00:56.456
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go,
all right?

14
00:00:56.456 --> 00:01:00.778
And then from here,

15
00:01:00.778 --> 00:01:08.921
let's go login = this.fb.group.

16
00:01:19.754 --> 00:01:21.258
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's go username.

17
00:01:27.088 --> 00:01:28.980
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll
just give it an empty value.

18
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.784
And Validators.required.

19
00:01:39.476 --> 00:01:41.808
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I wonder
why it does not like this.

20
00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:43.607
&gt;&gt; off screen female: Do you need this?

21
00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:45.895
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Is your interface
the same as your FormGroup?

22
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.080
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: For one.

23
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.560
Now what did I do here?

24
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.608
Is it like a-
&gt;&gt; off screen female: You don't

25
00:01:58.608 --> 00:02:01.115
need a parenthesis after the required.

26
00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:04.496
&gt;&gt; off screen male: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: No, there we go.

27
00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:07.460
That's the other thing,
is this a property or is this a method?

28
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.579
We'll go password,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay?

29
00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.285
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
since we're here, let's just go submit.

30
00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:24.622
And we'll go value is Login and Valid,

31
00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:30.295
so this is going to be
just like a boolean.

32
00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:39.466
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Help me out here.

33
00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:48.540
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Maybe that's right.

34
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.360
Let me double check.

35
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.470
&gt;&gt; off screen male: It was value valid and

36
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.520
then on the second one
there was an assignment.

37
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.070
Yeah.

38
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.211
&gt;&gt; off screen female: Where
is your interface?

39
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:00.102
&gt;&gt; off screen male: The first
thing was just value, valid, and

40
00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:01.337
then you're assigning it.

41
00:03:01.337 --> 00:03:04.670
Basically, you're taking
the properties and then assigning it.

42
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.290
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, so far so good?

43
00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.900
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Yeah.

44
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.280
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah,
and then here is value.

45
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.220
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Login.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [INAUDIBLE] Yeah,

46
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.249
your interface.

47
00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.164
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Login interface.

48
00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:19.910
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,
there we go.

49
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.080
Am I missing something?

50
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.503
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Do you need
to assign valid to a boolean?

51
00:03:29.503 --> 00:03:33.240
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now, so TSLint,
if you're just doing simple,

52
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.716
like it's a string or a primative,
you don't need to actually type it.

53
00:03:38.716 --> 00:03:39.742
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm trying to

54
00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:43.098
avoid doing this without actually looking
at how I did it in the other one.

55
00:03:43.098 --> 00:03:43.921
&gt;&gt; off screen male: No, this is good.

56
00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:45.857
I think they're just line errors.

57
00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:50.549
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah,
so we'll go c log and

58
00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.241
let's just check value and

59
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.310
we'll go VALID.

60
00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:09.230
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's
take out white spaces.

61
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.330
I would just live in fear of this for
the rest of my life.

62
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.480
It would be so
easy to just turn it off in TSLint,

63
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.240
but there's probably a super good reason.

64
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.570
It's just gonna be funny cuz we take out
our appendix, we don't need that anymore.

65
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.789
In 30 years, we're like,

66
00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.453
actually our soul [LAUGH] is in
our appendix and sorry, guys.

67
00:04:36.733 --> 00:04:39.000
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so
we'll go reset since we're here.

68
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.429
And this.login.reset.

69
00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:54.715
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
username, password.

70
00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:02.609
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Don't even say it,
I know, okay?

71
00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:05.904
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Since I'm here,

72
00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:12.740
we'll just,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What?

73
00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.376
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Just tab
the setting of the WebStorm,

74
00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:16.123
not introduce spaces at the beginning.

75
00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:23.135
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it's actually, that
sounds like almost too good of an idea.

76
00:05:23.135 --> 00:05:25.280
That would actually make my life better.

77
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.021
I will tackle that at lunch.

78
00:05:30.894 --> 00:05:34.866
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, so here,
we need to hook up the FormGroup.

79
00:05:34.866 --> 00:05:40.818
So see if they actually, ng.

80
00:05:47.181 --> 00:05:48.250
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Is it ngGroup?

81
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.670
What is?

82
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:50.210
&gt;&gt; off screen male: It's just one group.

83
00:05:54.994 --> 00:05:56.543
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Right.

84
00:05:56.543 --> 00:05:58.915
You know what?
That's what you get for

85
00:05:58.915 --> 00:06:02.355
doing angular JS for like ever.

86
00:06:02.355 --> 00:06:06.114
Cuz every once in awhile, I just wanna
sort of put NG on all the things.

87
00:06:11.376 --> 00:06:19.822
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Login and
formControlName,

88
00:06:19.822 --> 00:06:27.598
this is gonna be username.

89
00:06:27.598 --> 00:06:30.460
And down here,

90
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.410
formControlName = password.

91
00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.975
And then what we'll also do is submit and

92
00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:45.744
then we'll pass in login.

93
00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:54.709
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's see.

94
00:06:54.709 --> 00:06:56.981
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Cancel.

95
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:57.809
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

96
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.080
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did I call it reset?

97
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.580
I think I did.

98
00:07:11.307 --> 00:07:14.260
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right, so we're
doing a big pair programming session here.

99
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.225
I'll walk through this,
see if I miss anything.

100
00:07:17.225 --> 00:07:21.046
formGroup gets into the login formGroup.

101
00:07:21.046 --> 00:07:24.379
We're calling submit, we're just passing
that login formGroup back in for

102
00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:25.980
processing.

103
00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.656
formControlName, username,
formControlName,

104
00:07:30.656 --> 00:07:35.128
password, and on click,
we're calling reset.

105
00:07:35.128 --> 00:07:39.172
And so if we look into our component,

106
00:07:39.172 --> 00:07:43.743
we have FormGroup, FormBuilder group.

107
00:07:43.743 --> 00:07:50.278
And then submit is taking, so we're
basically destructuring the FormGroup and

108
00:07:50.278 --> 00:07:56.630
pulling value and valid off of it and
calling reset, so hopefully this works.

109
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.232
I'm just kind of saying a little prayer
in my heart because I really wanna go

110
00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:01.796
eat lunch.

111
00:08:12.972 --> 00:08:18.718
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Username simpleton,
password is top secret password.

112
00:08:21.732 --> 00:08:24.491
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: [LAUGH] That's funny.

113
00:08:24.491 --> 00:08:31.052
So down here on the bottom,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

114
00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.376
it is valid, and it also reset.
