00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.460
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So,
I'm going to just walk through this.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.280
For the sake of time I'm
going to use the CLI.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.071
But let's go ahead and
create a review component.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.540
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, ng c, or g c,
let me just zoom this up just a bit.

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.480
I tried to adjust the font in this,
in the web zone, it's a little hard.

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:38.010
So ng g c reviews -m because we
have multiple module in the root.

7
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.190
So this is just by having the angular
module, angular material module, etc.

8
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.350
We just need to do this, so app.module.ts.

9
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.650
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And let me just
zoom this back down a little bit, and

10
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.318
so you can see that it created a css file,
an html file,

11
00:00:56.318 --> 00:01:02.280
a spec and
then the component class in type script.

12
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.070
Is well, is it is updated the app module.

13
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.270
So I'm gonna walk through
what actually happened there.

14
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.959
So if we look in our app directory,

15
00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:19.057
we should have a reviews
folder with some CSS,

16
00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:24.320
some HTML, spec, and
in an empty component.

17
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.080
So I'll close everything down but
this for right now, actually let me do,

18
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.700
close down the spec and the css file.

19
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:36.089
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So let's go here and

20
00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:42.210
we'll go,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: is the heat.

21
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.350
And had we not used the CLI, so they
just really kinda streamline some stuff.

22
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.990
We would need to go in and
add this to declaration.

23
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.220
So if you're doing something by hand,

24
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.920
just make sure that you add
this to the declaration.

25
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.880
So I'm gonna just delete this, so

26
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.580
we can kinda see what this looks like
with, assume that I did this by hand.

27
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.430
So just type in a declarations, reviews,
component, imports it, you're good to go.

28
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.130
So now we need to add this
to the tom via the selector.

29
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.850
So in to the home we want a template,

30
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.740
this is kind of our landing place
de jour for these kind of things.

31
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:34.490
And because it is a reviews component,
we can ascertain that the selector for

32
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.840
this is app-reviews.

33
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.540
Like so and
I'm going to just put a horizontal rule.

34
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.270
And let's see if this renders.

35
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.110
Yay!

36
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.610
Okay, so far so good?

37
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.790
Everybody following along?

38
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.551
Now let's go ahead and
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: okay so

39
00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:06.030
The CLI command, Peter, is as follows.

40
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.490
ng g, for generate, c, for component,
so this is super shorthand,

41
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.650
reviews, and then because we have
multiple modules in the root directory,

42
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.500
we have to specify what
module we want it to load in,

43
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.270
which is app module.ts.

44
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:37.190
And so that is the command that I typed,
so ng g for generate, c for component,

45
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.965
reviews so that's the name of the
component, -m as in put it in this module,

46
00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:48.140
app.module.ts.

47
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.800
Thanks Mat G hashtag homie.

48
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I've got a question.

49
00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.200
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When I try using that

50
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.940
command from my command line, given
like you have to be inside the angular,

51
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.590
in order use the command.

52
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.369
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What is
your current working directory?

53
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.860
Anger dash rest dash ep,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

54
00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.220
you're in the folder
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: yup Let me see here,

55
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.920
so I'll look at that

56
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.299
in a moment, because it should be working,
because you should be in there.

57
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.420
I'll take a look, that's odd,
so we'll check that out.

58
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I had that issue yesterday.

59
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.560
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You're on a Mac too.

60
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.170
We'll look at that.

61
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.360
That seems like something's
kind of jumping tracks there.

62
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.200
So we have this in our view,
the Selector, right here.

63
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.940
Let's go ahead and add this to the route.

64
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.130
So if we go to app routing module.

65
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.220
I'm just going to duplicate this.

66
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.236
We'll go reviews, and reviews component,

67
00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:58.650
that's all there is to that.

68
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.520
Let's just double check this.

69
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.450
Add so now when we go /reviews,

70
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.950
It's gonna match that path and
load the component into the router outlet.

71
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.010
Now let's just take this a step further,
and just so

72
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.350
we can get into the sidebar,
we'll go reviews.

73
00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.000
We'll stay with this icon I suppose, here.

74
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.330
And what this does is then,
it loops over and

75
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.190
essentially adds a nav bar link,
for every item in the collection.

76
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.310
So we can just add this to the side bar,
so if you go here,

77
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.410
you'll see that we have reviews.

78
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.120
So we can click over to items,
and back to reviews, so

79
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.990
this is just an easy way
to navigate to this.

80
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.110
Now to finish this challenge off,
let's go ahead and add

81
00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:03.820
in a few properties that we can bind to,
so we'll go title frontend is the heat.

82
00:06:08.108 --> 00:06:11.450
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And we'll go ratings.

83
00:06:15.366 --> 00:06:18.704
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Five,
four, five, five, three,

84
00:06:18.704 --> 00:06:23.350
someone didn't like my jokes,
someone else did.

85
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.450
So we now have a title and a ratings.

86
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.070
If we go into our template now,

87
00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:36.150
we can go ahead and bind to
the title using double curly braces.

88
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.900
And do another horizontal
rule to separate things.

89
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.460
And we'll go, I don't know,
use just a /p tag,

90
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:49.837
I suppose, NgFor,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let

91
00:06:49.837 --> 00:06:54.425
rating of ratings,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll just

92
00:06:54.425 --> 00:06:55.090
bind to this.

93
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.251
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And let's see
what this looks like, as we expected.

94
00:07:04.251 --> 00:07:07.001
So you could do this even as a list,
list items, whatever.

95
00:07:07.001 --> 00:07:10.071
The point is, we're just taking
the collection and looping over it.
