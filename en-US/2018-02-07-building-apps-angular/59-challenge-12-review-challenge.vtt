00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.740
&gt;&gt; Lucas: What I'd like everybody to do,
is we're just going to create

2
00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.870
a child component, and I want us
to wire up an input and an output.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.520
So, what I'm thinking is just
create a status component.

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.520
You can use the CLI for this,
create kind of a currentStatus input.

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.230
So you could just say, logged in.

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.710
And then create a logout output.

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.610
So just put a button in there,
that when you click it just says hey,

8
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.135
I wanna logout.

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.040
And so the idea is to just know that you
need to basic communicate status into it,

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.710
and then also handle the event to change
the status as an output, and then

11
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.650
implement the necessary Ul elements to
facilitate communication between the two.

12
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.540
What's that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the branch?

13
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.830
&gt;&gt; Lucas: You can do it off of

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.834
any branch for now,
whatever branch you're on.

15
00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:55.674
it does not matter.

16
00:00:56.704 --> 00:00:59.354
You could do it on Master branch.

17
00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:02.394
So some of the examples we are going
to get into are only on Master.

18
00:01:02.394 --> 00:01:06.834
So in this case it probably would
be fine to just hop into Master and

19
00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:07.374
work from there
