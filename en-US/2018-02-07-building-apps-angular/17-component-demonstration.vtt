00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,
let me do a quick demonstration.

2
00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:03.753
I feel like I should do it
from a command line too.

3
00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:07.463
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: src/app.

4
00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:16.800
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
I'm gonna do a nachos component.

5
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.480
This would not be happening if
there was not Chipotle over there.

6
00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:26.788
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: nachos.

7
00:00:26.788 --> 00:00:32.321
All right, from here, touch,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Actually

8
00:00:32.321 --> 00:00:36.612
we'll go here,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm gonna do

9
00:00:36.612 --> 00:00:42.140
the whole,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Thing.

10
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.580
Just this one time.

11
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.310
So we do the spec, we'll do the template.

12
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.920
We'll do the css, okay?

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.005
From here, let's hop back into our ID.

14
00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:03.760
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You can see
that it's fairly conventional.

15
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.952
So let's go into our component
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And export class.

16
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.985
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Isn't
that interesting?

17
00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:20.494
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is,
as a JavaScript developer,

18
00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:23.750
the fact that it even
knows what's happening.

19
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.590
So I'll talk about this on the third day.

20
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.710
But there's actually some language
services things happening under the hood

21
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.326
that says you have this component?

22
00:01:30.326 --> 00:01:32.320
This is probably this
class you wanna create.

23
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.450
From here, I'm going to do this because we

24
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.960
have the help of the ID, generally import
and decorate happen at the same time.

25
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.140
Actually import happens
first via autocomplete.

26
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.003
So I've basically imported and decorated.

27
00:01:53.003 --> 00:01:59.262
And then selector, and
we'll go with nachos,

28
00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:03.337
and we'll go template, URL.

29
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.891
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now, styleUrls
is interesting because it's actually

30
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:21.986
an array, because you can
actually stack them together.

31
00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:32.890
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What
is this complaining about?

32
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.190
Yes, this is my least favorite.

33
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.720
Ts lint is this trailing spaces thing.

34
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.490
If I didn't have a bunch of people staring
at me, I would actually just turn it off.

35
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.312
But let's go into our template.

36
00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:59.730
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay,
did I miss anything?

37
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.969
I do not think so.

38
00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.272
Let me just double check
that I did this right.

39
00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:08.557
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I
think I did it correct.

40
00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:14.656
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So nachos, [SOUND]

41
00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:25.695
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now the next thing
that we have to do is we need to add this

42
00:03:25.695 --> 00:03:29.640
to our ng module, so
that Angular knows about it.

43
00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.120
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: NachosComponent,
and so

44
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.910
if you go up here you can see that
it actually did the import as well.

45
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.780
So thank you mature IDE,
doing my work for me.

46
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.288
And now how would we get
this into our application?

47
00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:48.613
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's the selector.

48
00:03:48.613 --> 00:03:50.030
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Selector, thank you.

49
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.250
So let's go here.

50
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.121
Burritos, you're out of here.

51
00:03:56.121 --> 00:03:57.122
Add nachos.

52
00:03:57.122 --> 00:03:58.221
Hopefully this works.

53
00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.358
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Ta-da!

54
00:04:06.358 --> 00:04:08.920
Makes sense, kinda what I did?

55
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.910
Class, import, decorate, and
start putting stuff on it.

56
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.340
Let me just do one thing real quick.

57
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.380
I'm gonna go back over to here.

58
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.501
And I'm just gonna bind to this
thing calls spicy, you can see here.

59
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:34.514
spicy =,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This,

60
00:04:34.514 --> 00:04:36.310
so it's a property.

61
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.172
And that I can then bind to.

62
00:04:38.172 --> 00:04:42.000
So again, properties, methods,
now it's available to your template.
