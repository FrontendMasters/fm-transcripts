&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: What I
would like everyone to do is to

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.020
just go through the application and
just look for the major pieces.

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.490
So, for instance,
I will kind of show you this and

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.680
we'll kinda go through it afterwards.

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.068
So let's actually just take
an all-encompassing 15 minute break,

6
00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:20.330
cuz I don't think this
will take very long.

7
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.931
I'd like everyone to just go through and
say, where are the components?

8
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:26.656
Okay, well, here's the class and
here's the template.

9
00:00:26.656 --> 00:00:30.030
And so, just poke around, and say,
well, what does service look like?

10
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.990
So you can see here that it's just
a class and it does some things.

11
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.180
So just take ten minutes, do nothing,
relax, and then take another five minutes

12
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.130
and start to just kinda look through,
identify some of the pieces.

13
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:47.570
And if you want, go ahead,

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.830
and you can add a property to
the Items component and bind to it.

15
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.870
And if you're feeling super ambitious,

16
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.970
just add a property to the ItemsService,
and then consume it in the component.
