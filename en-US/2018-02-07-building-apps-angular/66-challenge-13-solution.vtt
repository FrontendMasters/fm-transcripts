00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.350
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I'm gonna
go ahead and I'll do this as well.

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.520
I copy this useless snippet, and
I'll just pull something to browser.

3
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.790
If for those following along online, and

4
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.540
if you haven't If you didn't catch it
because we're working off of master.

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.840
Because some of the new
features that I did last night,

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.770
this will collide because this
component already exists.

7
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.190
So we're just kind of changing
the course just a little bit.

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.120
And we are changing it
to a login component.

9
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.403
So ng g c, we'll go login.

10
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.052
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go,

11
00:00:48.052 --> 00:00:50.853
component has been created.

12
00:00:50.853 --> 00:00:55.896
I'll go ahead and add this

13
00:00:55.896 --> 00:01:01.825
to
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: My

14
00:01:04.261 --> 00:01:05.111
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Home.

15
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:10.337
So if I flip over this should be here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: There we go.

16
00:01:10.337 --> 00:01:16.246
So now if we go back and let's start
to build out kind of the base for

17
00:01:16.246 --> 00:01:18.191
us to knock this out.

18
00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:23.064
So log in, CSS is going to the snip in

19
00:01:25.472 --> 00:01:29.941
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Copy this in, boom.

20
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:37.927
We'll go to the component here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And the HTML

21
00:01:45.907 --> 00:01:47.807
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm just gonna change

22
00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:53.012
something real quick here on the fly,
username, password.

23
00:01:53.012 --> 00:01:55.648
And I'm just gonna change
this to password as well.

24
00:01:57.972 --> 00:01:58.732
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Just a small

25
00:01:58.732 --> 00:01:59.721
change there.

26
00:01:59.721 --> 00:02:07.006
And,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: The only

27
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:12.320
thing I need to do here,
I see the copy actually

28
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.939
this piece right here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: To this

29
00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.032
component all ready exist.

30
00:02:20.032 --> 00:02:22.247
The differences,
I'll just put this import in,

31
00:02:22.247 --> 00:02:24.370
we'll see in just a moment
why I'm doing this.

32
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.060
And let's say we have a Login interface,
an object, so

33
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.270
it's just a username and a password.

34
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.120
So I'll just leave this up here.

35
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.749
And so basically,
I just copied that first few lines.

36
00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.776
I changed the interface To
kinda match what we're doing.

37
00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:48.509
And then,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: The interface

38
00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:52.743
has changed as well as the form itself.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

39
00:02:52.743 --> 00:02:57.460
we will revisit this in just a moment but
let's talk about reactive forms.
