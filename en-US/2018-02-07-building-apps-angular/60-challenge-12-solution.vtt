00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.890
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Let's jump in and
solve this challenge.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.680
We're basically creating
a status component.

3
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.510
So first thing's first.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: How do I wanna do this?

4
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.360
Do this from the command line so
ng g C Status.

5
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.940
I'm just gonna put it,
we're not nesting it or anything.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.282
Then we'll do /m and it's app.module.ts.

7
00:00:31.446 --> 00:00:33.460
&gt;&gt; Lucas: So component is created.

8
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.366
Let's hop into our code, and
let's go into our home component.

9
00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:45.160
So we're operating under
the assumption that

10
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.362
the status component is
been added to our module.

11
00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:54.270
So the next thing is that once
you generate it from the CLI,

12
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.710
it's ready to go.

13
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:04.016
So in our home component
&gt;&gt; Lucas: home.component.html

14
00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:10.286
&gt;&gt; Lucas: I'll just go ahead and

15
00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:11.215
add this so,

16
00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:16.390
believe it's gonna be app-status.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: And

17
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.645
let's see if this renders.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Status works.

18
00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:24.781
Okay so that is,

19
00:01:24.781 --> 00:01:29.501
I think even with commentary that
took me like three minutes or less.

20
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:35.100
So getting components up and running and
in your application, very, very easy.

21
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.460
So now let's go ahead and
do the property binding.

22
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.587
So we're sending something from
the parent into the child.

23
00:01:43.587 --> 00:01:49.781
So when you're doing an input or
when you're doing inputs and

24
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:55.150
outputs, those are defined
at the child component.

25
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.806
So the child component is saying,
this is what I'll accept in and

26
00:01:57.806 --> 00:02:00.480
this is what I'm going to communicate out.

27
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.540
So we'll go input, and remember this
is a function you have to call it or

28
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.130
you'll run into problems.

29
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.217
And we'll just go currentStatus.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Okay,

30
00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:18.444
so now that we've created this input,

31
00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:26.300
we now have a property that we can
bind to on the parent component.

32
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:33.466
So if we go over to the home component,
&gt;&gt; Lucas: You'll notice,

33
00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:38.290
hopefully, WebStorm picks this up,
currentStatus.

34
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.069
This is, whew, and I'm just gonna put

35
00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.330
something here, we'll just say myStatus.

36
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.650
This doesn't exist yet, but
this is what we wanna populate it with.

37
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.371
So let's go back to home.component.ts and

38
00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:03.164
let's go myStatus and we'll just say

39
00:03:03.164 --> 00:03:08.673
active.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Okay,

40
00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:12.507
so now we've set it on
the parent component and

41
00:03:12.507 --> 00:03:18.690
we are passing it to the child component,
the others property.

42
00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.740
So they're basically binding
on the same property.

43
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.342
So if we then go to status components,
let's actually

44
00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:34.435
go status component.html.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: We'll

45
00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:38.399
go h1,
&gt;&gt; Lucas: My Status

46
00:03:40.634 --> 00:03:42.422
&gt;&gt; Lucas: currentStatus.

47
00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:44.707
And so now we're saying,
when this comes in,

48
00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:47.760
go ahead render it in the child template.

49
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.710
So if we go back here,
the current status is active.

50
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.830
Let's take this one step further just so

51
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.480
we can show you that when it changes
on the parent, it changes in the child.

52
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.453
So I'm going to borrow an element.

53
00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:16.380
&gt;&gt; Lucas: From this form over here.

54
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:25.825
Let's hop back into the home component.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: And

55
00:04:25.825 --> 00:04:30.560
for this will go in g model.

56
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.297
Now one thing I need to
do is double bind this,

57
00:04:46.108 --> 00:04:46.791
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Go ahead and

58
00:04:46.791 --> 00:04:49.591
set a placeholder here and
what I'll do as well,

59
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:54.050
let me just kinda start to break this out,
just cuz we only have so much space.

60
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.972
So we are going to bind this
input using two way data binding

61
00:05:00.972 --> 00:05:06.980
to myStatus.

62
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.080
So whenever my status changes,
it's going to change here.

63
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.981
And therefore, it'll effect currentStatus
in the child component if all

64
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:21.756
goes well.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: So

65
00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:25.450
you can see this is, because it's two-way,
it's already pre-populated.

66
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.550
So we're sending this property
from the class into the template.

67
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.573
But because we're event binding,
when I type in here,

68
00:05:34.573 --> 00:05:39.625
you can see that it's basically
raising that event and saying, hey,

69
00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:45.213
the template was updated for component
class, you need to update yourself.

70
00:05:45.213 --> 00:05:50.524
So you can chang this to whatever.

71
00:05:50.524 --> 00:05:54.885
So this is input binding, so
as we change it on the parent,

72
00:05:54.885 --> 00:06:00.398
it changes on the child.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: And

73
00:06:00.398 --> 00:06:04.937
what's nice about this is
that if we go back to our

74
00:06:04.937 --> 00:06:09.809
status component, no logic,
just pulling it in and

75
00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:14.820
just automatically rendering
it in to the template.

76
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.376
Now let's go here and
let's create an output.

77
00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:22.540
So we wanna have some event within
the component that is going to

78
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.270
indicate the parent that we need to
change the status to something else.

79
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.130
So let's go output.

80
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.560
This is also method and
we'll just call this logout.

81
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.327
Now this is
&gt;&gt; Lucas: An EventEmitter

82
00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:45.317
&gt;&gt; Lucas: And what's funny is,

83
00:06:45.317 --> 00:06:47.706
this is actually inspired
by the node EventEmitter,

84
00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.830
well this is why you
get a few options here.

85
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.153
We're gonna go with one from angular core.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: And so

86
00:06:55.153 --> 00:07:01.992
now, if you go back to the home component,
&gt;&gt; Lucas: That's not the home component,

87
00:07:01.992 --> 00:07:02.900
this is the home component.

88
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.190
And you can imagine that there's
going to be a logout event.

89
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:11.930
Well, thank you WebStorm.

90
00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:19.260
Log out and then from here,
we'll go into define my event handler.

91
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.570
And obviously, it's saying,
hey, this doesn't exist.

92
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:30.398
So we'll go ahead and
define this and so we'll say,

93
00:07:30.398 --> 00:07:35.794
log out.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Just

94
00:07:35.794 --> 00:07:37.450
take the event even though i
don't really care about it.

95
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:45.435
And we'll go this,
my status equals LOGGED OUT.

96
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.300
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Now we're almost there.

97
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.130
We got one more piece.

98
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.960
We need to actually fire it
from the child component.

99
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.383
So going back to here,
I'm just going to steal

100
00:08:03.383 --> 00:08:08.407
this button, rather steal this button into

101
00:08:08.407 --> 00:08:13.236
our template.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Just

102
00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:17.507
like the horizontal rule everything,
and from here,

103
00:08:22.154 --> 00:08:25.887
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Logout.emit and we'll just send

104
00:08:25.887 --> 00:08:30.737
the event.
&gt;&gt; Lucas: Even

105
00:08:30.737 --> 00:08:33.360
though we don't really need it,
we can over here.

106
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.850
So hopefully this renders, boom.

107
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:44.870
And notice, so now from the child,
we were saying this event was clicked,

108
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:48.080
parent you handle it,
you decide what to do.

109
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.580
So this is very common,
a lot of times I have a three year old and

110
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.720
a six year old,
my three year old would come to me and

111
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.470
he'll just have something
that is totally broken.

112
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.130
He's just like, what do I do?

113
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.850
This happened, what do I do?

114
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.370
As the parent, I'm responsible for

115
00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:09.350
them exercising sound judgement and
making the right decision.

116
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.330
And so,
this is very much of a child saying,

117
00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:13.680
I don't know what to do,
you handle it, you're the parent.

118
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.969
And from here, again just going back,
what I love about this and

119
00:09:18.969 --> 00:09:23.334
I keep saying this over and over, is that
&gt;&gt; Lucas: This

120
00:09:23.334 --> 00:09:26.736
component
&gt;&gt; Lucas: There's not really any

121
00:09:26.736 --> 00:09:27.390
moving parts.

122
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:32.460
And so, if it is actually
a presentational component or

123
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.440
a dumb component, I'll even parse
it down and just take out on init,

124
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:40.980
just to say that this is just binding,
this is all we're using.
