1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I wanna do,
just to make sure that

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm not leaving anybody behind,
anybody is not overwhelmed.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.335
I'm going to go through this solution,
and I'm really gonna take my time, and

4
00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:15.027
I'm going to talk through it.

5
00:00:15.027 --> 00:00:19.713
And if at any point I get to
something that's sticky or

6
00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:25.234
that is confusing, just raise your hand,
ask me to clarify and

7
00:00:25.234 --> 00:00:30.410
I will take as long as I need
to get through this challenge.

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.948
Cuz honestly, component classes and
templates are just

9
00:00:34.948 --> 00:00:40.090
the foundation of everything
that we're going to do.

10
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.256
And so
I definitely do not want to rush it,

11
00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:48.878
I would actually rather cover less
material, and have everybody get it.

12
00:00:48.878 --> 00:00:52.209
And if I have to say something four or
five times,

13
00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:54.660
totally more than happy to do that.

14
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.880
So, let's go through and
do this challenge.

15
00:01:02.316 --> 00:01:10.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And from here,
Iâ€™m just going to cut this out.

16
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.961
So this is just as if,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I pasted this in for

17
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:16.969
the very first time.

18
00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:23.912
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'll
also get rid of this and

19
00:01:23.912 --> 00:01:28.304
so all we have now is a widgets array.

20
00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:31.440
So it is an array of widgets
objects that we pasted in.

21
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.370
And is well, just this template and so

22
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.220
this is very, very basic HTML
there's nothing special about.

23
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.620
I just did not want everybody to spend
in 20 minutes doing the layout and

24
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.010
getting in the weeds.

25
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.060
So now, if we look at the challenge,

26
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.320
create a widgets collection
in the widgets component.

27
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.160
So we've done this, so now,

28
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.700
the next thing that we need to do is
we need to create a way to keep track

29
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.500
of the current widget, so this is
the nature of a master detail view.

30
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.573
You have a master collection of something,

31
00:02:13.573 --> 00:02:18.554
you select one of the items in
the collection that you can then act upon,

32
00:02:18.554 --> 00:02:22.143
and so we need to keep track
of the selected widget.

33
00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:27.234
So the first thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to

34
00:02:27.234 --> 00:02:32.340
create a property, and
I'm going to define it.

35
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.710
But I'm not going to put a value into it,
I'm going to declare it, but

36
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.580
it's not going to be undefined.

37
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.280
But it is here,
the next thing that I'm going to do, and

38
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.983
this is slightly getting
the cart before the horse, but

39
00:02:49.983 --> 00:02:54.203
I know that I need a way
to set the selected widget.

40
00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.867
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so, I'm just
gonna create a selected method that takes

41
00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:07.025
a widget, and so this is kind of
a basic center style function.

42
00:03:07.025 --> 00:03:10.726
That,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It sets

43
00:03:10.726 --> 00:03:16.649
this.selectedwidget to
whatever widget we send in.

44
00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:23.806
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

45
00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:28.571
now I've created a property,
selectedwidget,

46
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:33.449
and I have a selected method
that accepts a widget,

47
00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.890
and assigns that to selected widget.

48
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.687
So far, so good,
everybody understand what I've done?

49
00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:44.928
One property, or rather two properties,

50
00:03:44.928 --> 00:03:49.977
when you count the collection I pasted in,
and one method, okay.

51
00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:54.846
So now that we have our component
class with a property and

52
00:03:54.846 --> 00:03:58.280
a method, let's go to our template.

53
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.310
So this is widgetscomponent.html,

54
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.500
and we need to essentially
create a list item for

55
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.420
every widget in our array.

56
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:18.194
So using ngFor we can say
let widget of widgets,

57
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.380
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And because we created

58
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.208
widget, this local variable for
this iteration,

59
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:32.690
we'll go here and we'll bind to this.

60
00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.066
So widget.name, and let's go here.

61
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.274
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll go widget, and
you can see here that it knows kinda what

62
00:04:43.274 --> 00:04:49.247
we're dealing with, so widget.description,
and let's see how this renders.

63
00:04:52.536 --> 00:04:56.337
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So you can see here,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're just using NG4.

64
00:04:56.337 --> 00:05:00.008
We're looping over the widgets
collection and for

65
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:04.015
each item in the collection,
or each widget, rather,

66
00:05:04.015 --> 00:05:08.730
in the collection, we're binding
to a property on that object.

67
00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:10.534
Does that make sense?

68
00:05:12.846 --> 00:05:13.346
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay.

69
00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:17.112
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
now the question is,

70
00:05:17.112 --> 00:05:22.990
when I have this list of widgets,
how do I select one?

71
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.613
So obviously, kind of the basic event for

72
00:05:26.613 --> 00:05:30.347
that would be a click,
so on the list item.

73
00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:36.270
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And I will break this
down, so it's kind of on each individual,

74
00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:41.386
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Thing.

75
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.591
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We'll go click,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

76
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:57.687
we'll go selected,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then we'll go widget.

77
00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.122
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So now what is
happening is when this list-item is

78
00:06:06.122 --> 00:06:09.163
clicked, it's calling selected and

79
00:06:09.163 --> 00:06:13.641
parsing in the widget that
it scoped to that iteration.

80
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:19.146
And so Angular is pretty good at keeping
track of when I'm looping over this,

81
00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:23.889
that each item has a specific and
unique variable or essentially,

82
00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.250
yeah, local variable that's
assigned to that element.

83
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.217
So it's not getting them mixed up.

84
00:06:32.068 --> 00:06:34.790
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
let's go down here.

85
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.235
So under nbcard I'm just going
to create a horizontal rule.

86
00:06:38.235 --> 00:06:44.774
And we'll go pre and
we will go selected widget.

87
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.146
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And we'll just go
adjacent, so I want to dump this out.

88
00:06:56.952 --> 00:06:59.245
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: In fact I don't
know why I did this under the card.

89
00:06:59.245 --> 00:07:04.510
It seems like I left
myself a little love note,

90
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.973
they're like hey, here it is, okay.

91
00:07:08.973 --> 00:07:11.860
So now let's check this.

92
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:18.999
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: By the way,
sure, I haven't done index key value

93
00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:23.650
pairs a ton but
we'll certainly give that a shot.

94
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.003
So after this is over
let's see what happens.

95
00:07:27.003 --> 00:07:30.491
All right, so now, as I select this,

96
00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:36.499
you'll notice I select the green widget,
it's now showing up.

97
00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:40.801
Let's do a couple things real quick.

98
00:07:42.578 --> 00:07:49.050
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: If I go to,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: itemscomponent.css,

99
00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.387
they have a bit of functionality
that I quite like, and

100
00:07:53.387 --> 00:07:58.569
that is if I go to Items,
you notice here when I do this mouse over,

101
00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.864
you get this kind of this cool,
hey, this has focus.

102
00:08:02.864 --> 00:08:07.661
And so I'm going to borrow that

103
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:12.833
from the itemscomponent.css.

104
00:08:12.833 --> 00:08:17.295
Hop back over to here, paste this in,
let's see if we've made this any better.

105
00:08:17.295 --> 00:08:19.890
Yeah, I think so.

106
00:08:24.323 --> 00:08:28.121
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And now we can see as
we select this that we're just rendering

107
00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:30.810
it out, which for now is completely fine.

108
00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:36.205
Because what we're going to
do next is we are going to,

109
00:08:36.205 --> 00:08:41.040
or by the end of the day hopefully, we are
going to actually push this into a form.

110
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.026
But for now we just want to
see that we are selecting,

111
00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:47.654
probably selecting a widget, and

112
00:08:47.654 --> 00:08:52.818
all this is doing is it's a click event,
that's calling a method,

113
00:08:52.818 --> 00:08:58.188
select in this case, and passing in
the widget that we have selected.

114
00:08:58.188 --> 00:08:59.639
Any questions about this so far?

115
00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.073
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: How do you
feel about this my friend?

116
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.820
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Cheeky.

117
00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:12.425
It sounds so easy when I say it, but
then, it's like, go forth and do it.

118
00:09:12.425 --> 00:09:15.830
So just to review, again.

119
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.708
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Just simple method,
click we're passing in the widget which is

120
00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:27.780
then setting the selected widget
which we're then binding to.

121
00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:34.833
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now,
in the challenge we also had used

122
00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:39.422
ngf to show an alternate message,

123
00:09:39.422 --> 00:09:42.913
if no widget is selected.

124
00:09:44.977 --> 00:09:51.140
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so here, or
rather here, we're saying select a widget.

125
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:58.641
Well, what I'd like to do is actually,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Show

126
00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:01.303
an alternate message.

127
00:10:01.303 --> 00:10:02.940
So we'll go selectedWidget.

128
00:10:10.218 --> 00:10:15.040
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
let's go selectedWidget.name.

129
00:10:16.888 --> 00:10:19.573
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so now we're
simply saying if there's a selected

130
00:10:19.573 --> 00:10:21.670
widget, then go ahead and show the name.

131
00:10:25.378 --> 00:10:28.271
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Eventually I'm
going to land on the browser, so

132
00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:29.265
now you can see.

133
00:10:33.488 --> 00:10:37.448
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Well, this is
fantastic, but currently we have no way

134
00:10:37.448 --> 00:10:42.802
other than to kind of I guess refreshing
it to verify that this is working.

135
00:10:42.802 --> 00:10:47.393
What we can do is we can go down here and

136
00:10:47.393 --> 00:10:53.330
on the cancel, so
what event should I use here?

137
00:10:55.243 --> 00:10:57.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: SelectedWidgit and
pass nothing?

138
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.410
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Click

139
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.430
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Click, good,

140
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.070
okay, perfect.

141
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.770
So click we're also
going to call select in.

142
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:12.270
But in this case, we actually wanna
send a null widget, so that is null.

143
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.218
So now let's check this out.

144
00:11:18.108 --> 00:11:23.246
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Here, and so I click
Cancel, should call selectedWidget,

145
00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:26.080
but it will set it to null, boom.

146
00:11:28.212 --> 00:11:30.994
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So still,
I think on the JavaScript side in terms of

147
00:11:30.994 --> 00:11:34.510
complexity, we're still at
about kind of a two or a three.

148
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.590
We're just starting to put together
these kinda really simple things

149
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:42.390
together in a way that actually does
some pretty interesting things.

150
00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.056
And, just kind of a side note here,
it's really easy,

151
00:11:46.056 --> 00:11:50.348
it's kind of a new programmer,
to really make things mystical.

152
00:11:50.348 --> 00:11:55.413
And we're doing these really hard things
but I find that I do a lot of simple,

153
00:11:55.413 --> 00:11:59.750
fundamental, foundational things over and
over.

154
00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.940
It's when you truly understand
how to do these fundamental

155
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.628
foundational things that
you could start to compose

156
00:12:07.628 --> 00:12:12.595
them together to create things that
does meaningful work for people.

157
00:12:12.595 --> 00:12:14.205
So non trigger applications, so

158
00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:18.410
it's really just a composition of a bunch
of foundational techniques done very well.

159
00:12:20.586 --> 00:12:26.474
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so
let's go real quick, let's go in here.

160
00:12:26.474 --> 00:12:30.774
And just because I don't remember
the syntax off the top of my

161
00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:34.718
head,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm just going to

162
00:12:34.718 --> 00:12:37.809
paste this in, and then we will
explain kind of how this works.

163
00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:44.012
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So with Angular 4,

164
00:12:44.012 --> 00:12:49.170
they introduced this
concept of ng if else.

165
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:52.828
And so how this works is, if one
condition is true they show one thing,

166
00:12:52.828 --> 00:12:54.692
if not then you show another thing.

167
00:12:54.692 --> 00:12:59.744
And so this also gives us the opportunity
to see another local template variable and

168
00:12:59.744 --> 00:13:00.700
action.

169
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.866
And so in this case, we're saying
here's this template fragment and

170
00:13:04.866 --> 00:13:06.784
we're going to call it prompt.

171
00:13:06.784 --> 00:13:13.310
And so now, what we're saying is ngif so
we'll dial this back in, selectedWidget.

172
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.370
If it's true, show this,

173
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:22.628
if not,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then show this,

174
00:13:22.628 --> 00:13:27.034
so it's just ngif else, so
it shows one thing or another.

175
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.095
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
we'll actually do select.

176
00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:39.764
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So ngif else,
show this template fragment.

177
00:13:48.490 --> 00:13:51.961
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So you can see,
it's selected, cancel it and

178
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:54.992
you're getting the alternate prompt.

179
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:07.718
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now let me try
something off the top of my head.

180
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:15.969
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
we'll just see what happens here.

181
00:14:28.836 --> 00:14:33.483
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, somebody asked to

182
00:14:33.483 --> 00:14:37.890
see a key value pair.

183
00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:45.738
And so I am going to oblige and
see what actually happens here.

184
00:14:45.738 --> 00:14:49.019
I know I haven't done this in a while but

185
00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:56.160
if all else fails,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then

186
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.605
we just pull it up in the docs and
see what comes of this.

187
00:14:59.605 --> 00:15:03.492
So,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I have here,

188
00:15:03.492 --> 00:15:05.231
basic key value pair.

189
00:15:05.231 --> 00:15:10.838
So if I wanted to get this object I
just pass in the key, like for instance

190
00:15:10.838 --> 00:15:16.835
this goes back to property binding when
I was talking about array notation.

191
00:15:16.835 --> 00:15:25.154
You can go first widget = thi.testWidgets,
and pass this in.

192
00:15:25.154 --> 00:15:27.030
And this could actually be,

193
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:32.360
generally it'll be actually a string if
you're dealing with a JSON structure.

194
00:15:35.443 --> 00:15:37.144
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Like so.

195
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:43.430
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so this is also
when I was talking about below notation.

196
00:15:46.617 --> 00:15:51.530
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It looks like this,
or more so if we had it like a key.

197
00:15:54.756 --> 00:15:59.052
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then key can change,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's

198
00:15:59.052 --> 00:16:01.600
how it's going to return this.

199
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:06.397
So this is where one array notation comes
in, but a kind of key value pair of stuff.

200
00:16:06.397 --> 00:16:14.543
Is that you're able to look up
an object on a collection immediately.

201
00:16:14.543 --> 00:16:19.460
All right, so with that said,
let's see if I can iterate over this.

202
00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.080
Wish me luck, we'll see what happens.

203
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.946
So let's go p,

204
00:16:34.554 --> 00:16:38.277
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And ngFor.

205
00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:59.593
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Hold on.

206
00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:12.643
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I have a feeling that

207
00:17:12.643 --> 00:17:19.880
this is not liking this.

208
00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:46.904
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: This is
not particularly helpful.

209
00:17:56.937 --> 00:18:02.289
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
I'm not going to let you

210
00:18:02.289 --> 00:18:09.107
get in the weeds too much on this.

211
00:18:09.107 --> 00:18:13.070
I may just have to come back tomorrow and
show, I'll look into it.

212
00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:19.166
So let's just press pause on that,
and I'll look into that.

213
00:18:19.166 --> 00:18:25.336
The next question is, does it have to be
NG template if we're using else with ngif?

214
00:18:25.336 --> 00:18:32.359
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes,
Iâ€™m pretty sure that is the case, yeah,
