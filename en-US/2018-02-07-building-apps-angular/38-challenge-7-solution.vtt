00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.760
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm gonna do
the solution for this challenge and

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.580
I'm going to get into
component-driven architecture.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.750
So hopping into the code.

4
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.450
Let's actually just,
cuz I know where I'm going here.

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.430
I'm just gonna queue up widgets.

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.120
The goal is to wrap this into a form.

7
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.540
All right, so item detail component.

8
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.645
I'm just gonna copy this and
let's hop into the widget component.

9
00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:32.766
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And let's go ahead,

10
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:41.346
and I think I wanna be down here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's paste this in.

11
00:00:48.814 --> 00:00:49.918
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now there's a few

12
00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:51.906
things we're going to change,

13
00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:55.374
because obviously we're
moving from items to widget.

14
00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:59.278
So do a little bit of
a copy paste job here.

15
00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:14.846
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I wanna focus on

16
00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:19.430
here is that one, edit a form.

17
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.806
I did create a reference to ngForm,
called my form.

18
00:01:23.806 --> 00:01:28.394
So this is kinda carry over from the
previous, damn I did during the module.

19
00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:35.102
But I have an input and using ngModel, I'm
just binding it selectedWidget.name and

20
00:01:35.102 --> 00:01:41.079
selectedWidget.description.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

21
00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:48.039
so, if we didn't do anything else.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Just refresh the page.

22
00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.490
Let's see, I probably, what did I break?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So,

23
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.272
you have to select a widget.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah,

24
00:01:54.272 --> 00:01:59.225
so
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What we're

25
00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:00.490
going to do here.

26
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.300
So this brings up an issue that

27
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.140
is solved in the items detail component
that we haven't brought up yet.

28
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.671
And that is,
we are using the same form for

29
00:02:15.671 --> 00:02:19.954
creating an item and updating an item.

30
00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:22.404
Because essentially the form is the same.

31
00:02:22.404 --> 00:02:25.955
So I've seen it done where you're
actually swapping out the forms, so

32
00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:28.860
you have an edit form and a create form.

33
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.170
In most cases I think you
can use the same form, and

34
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.210
then just detect like is there an ID or
not?

35
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.480
If there is not an ID, it's a new thing,
go ahead and create it.

36
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.710
If not, then go ahead and update it.

37
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.180
And so, this form is always bound
to an object in this case a widget.

38
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.300
The problem is that widget doesn't
exist until we select something.

39
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.580
So what we need to do is pre-populate

40
00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.980
our selected widget with an empty widget,
because if we're not editing it,

41
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.280
we're always creating it,
so ABC, Always Be Creating.

42
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.780
So let's go here.

43
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.130
And what I'm going to do, is, I'm
actually going to create a reset method.

44
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.690
And I'm just going to go
this.selectedWidget equals ID null,

45
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.980
name is an empty string and
description is also an empty string.

46
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.000
And so, what this does is it just says,
hey I wanna reset.

47
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.790
So it just creates an empty widget object.

48
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.720
And from here this.reset, so

49
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.250
I'm just gonna call it every time
the form loads, we just call reset.

50
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.870
So we're basically populating it.

51
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.306
Any time it loads it's getting a brand new

52
00:03:49.306 --> 00:03:54.274
object.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's see what's going

53
00:03:54.274 --> 00:03:59.423
on with widgetsService.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I've

54
00:03:59.423 --> 00:04:00.638
no idea what they're talking about there.

55
00:04:00.638 --> 00:04:05.510
And this white space drives me crazy.

56
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.770
It's probably in there for a good reason.

57
00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.050
Let's refresh the page.

58
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.020
You can see now it worked.

59
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.820
So this is one thing that
you will run into it's like,

60
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.696
I'm trying to bind into
it's not happening.

61
00:04:18.696 --> 00:04:22.515
So what you wanna do is control
how the form is initialized.

62
00:04:22.515 --> 00:04:24.769
And so by doing a reset method,

63
00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:30.758
I am essentially pre-populating it with
kinda this new pristine widget object,

64
00:04:30.758 --> 00:04:36.975
that I can then start to edit.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I can also do,

65
00:04:36.975 --> 00:04:42.430
since I'm here, is,
I'm going to create a cancel method.

66
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.820
And whenever somebody clicks cancel,
well let's just call reset.

67
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.413
And then from here we'll
go back into the template.

68
00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:03.327
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm just going to

69
00:05:03.327 --> 00:05:07.220
call, cancel.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

70
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.460
what this allows me to do is if we go
here, select, cancel, select, cancel.

71
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.410
So also extracting out that reset method,
we can call it in a few different places

72
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.150
and it becomes one more
useful than it would

73
00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.090
be if it was just tucked in somewhere but
it's also a very easy method to test.

74
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.280
One thing I will do as well, I'm noticing
that the layout is a little not up to par.

75
00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.130
So often times I'll just hop in,
pull in the styles, I don't need that.

76
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.450
Let's go here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Paste this in.

77
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.550
Yeah, it's starting to look good.

78
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:03.370
Okay, then, feeling I was
supposed to do something else.

79
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.487
Let's just hook these buttons up.

80
00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:14.809
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So on submit,

81
00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:23.717
let's go ahead and call save
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: In

82
00:06:23.717 --> 00:06:30.895
the component itself, we just go
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Save.

83
00:06:30.895 --> 00:06:38.075
Takes a widget.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: SAVING WIDGET,

84
00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:40.351
so we're just gonna trace this out for
right now.

85
00:06:54.162 --> 00:06:55.100
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: One thing we will do.

86
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.320
Obviously once it's saved,
we'll go ahead and reset as well.

87
00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.610
So this is where small fine grained
abstractions are really handy.

88
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.700
So here, cancel this.

89
00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:13.970
Let's go ahead and create a new one.

90
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.870
Save let's see passing it in.

91
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.738
Because if we don't have an ID it's null.

92
00:07:20.738 --> 00:07:25.743
If we wanna say,
what do we call create or update on our

93
00:07:25.743 --> 00:07:31.664
service to send it back or
do we check on the ID and go from there.

94
00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:38.082
Then you can see that is well,
my did have a local reference created,

95
00:07:38.082 --> 00:07:45.508
my form it was ngForm that was then using
to disable or enable the submit button.

96
00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:48.128
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: When we are doing that for

97
00:07:48.128 --> 00:07:51.717
the attribute disabled we may not
have the square bracket, right?

98
00:07:51.717 --> 00:07:56.017
Because it's not actually property

99
00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.835
binding across the class and-
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Well,

100
00:07:59.835 --> 00:08:05.447
let's see what happens.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

101
00:08:05.447 --> 00:08:10.449
right now,
because it's not being bound, it's just

102
00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:15.380
going to render this as a string.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Have a difficulty

103
00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.410
process for that, no?

104
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.772
This type-
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: First of all,

105
00:08:19.772 --> 00:08:27.903
let's see if this is.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Inspect the

106
00:08:27.903 --> 00:08:29.743
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It'll put a little value

107
00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:31.780
there.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yeah.

108
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.518
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I think you could,

109
00:08:37.518 --> 00:08:39.796
I would need to look at the style guides,
but

110
00:08:39.796 --> 00:08:43.993
I think that is
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Considered

111
00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:46.140
kinda a anti pattern.

112
00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:49.830
You would wanna use property binding
instead, but let's just see.

113
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.760
This is a very kinda a AngularJS way to do

114
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.690
it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

115
00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:57.670
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it does work

116
00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.430
personally, I would use property
binding and do it that way.

117
00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:04.320
But good point.

118
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.450
You could do it.

119
00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:06.490
You don't see a lot of it,

120
00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:10.960
because binding has been expanded
out to include properties and events
