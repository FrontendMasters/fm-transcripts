00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What would you say was

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.150
the most surprising thing
that you learned today?

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.770
So for some of us not knowing Angular or
some of us only 1.X.

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.880
What was something that was
just like I had no idea?

5
00:00:15.814 --> 00:00:20.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes, I agree.

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.120
What's interesting is that I think, at
least for me, Angular is super powerful.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.220
I mean, there is so much stuff you can do.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.610
Like the way that they set
up the renderer, but for

9
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.300
doing the most kind of common things,
it's just drop dead simple.

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.660
I think where people get overwhelmed
is setting up the tooling.

11
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.023
And get in up and running, and I think
has solved that problem in a big way.

12
00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:49.520
So even Mark, we did this course
a year ago, he's like man, like.

13
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.050
I can't believe, I don't remember being
a CC, well the answer is it wasn't.

14
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.339
But now we can say that we're matured.

15
00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.080
And the has matured and
you know, three commands.

16
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.740
You have a working project
rather the gates it's just,

17
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.600
it's really, really, really.

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.610
Nice and
a lot of these really painful parts,

19
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.310
that a lot of us early adopters feel.

20
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.090
So, Dan Wahlin for instance, lives in
Phoenix, on the other side of Phoenix.

21
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.070
But when it was first coming out,
Dan, John, myself, different ones.

22
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.680
We'd kinda be up at hacking on it, and

23
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.840
we'd just be like,
I can't take this anymore.

24
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.745
Chair through the window.

25
00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:29.771
[NOISE] Then we go complain to the team,
and it would get a little better.

26
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:34.028
But now, I think it's,
a lot of the really ugly pieces,

27
00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:36.440
even by them fixing the router.

28
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.990
Which was one of the biggest,
painful, most embarrassing things?

29
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.270
All of a sudden,
now the router is really, really good.

30
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.350
And I feel like it's finally came
full-circle And it's easy to use.

31
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.170
And, on the other hand,
it's super powerful.

32
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.020
Anyone else?

33
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.330
So I think I agree.

34
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.190
Pretty easy to do a lot with a little.

35
00:01:58.215 --> 00:01:59.015
So what about you?

36
00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:01.425
This was kind of your
first foray into Angular.

37
00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:02.845
What do you think?

38
00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:05.765
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well it's funny to hear how
you guys have so much more experience.

39
00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:09.285
So it's funny to hear you guys
use words like simple and easy.

40
00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:14.135
Where for me,
a lot of the syntax is still foreign.

41
00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.635
So I understand.

42
00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:21.000
You said learning the tooling
is very important and handshake.

43
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.390
Getting handshake down, so
I'll tonight work on the handshake.

44
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.890
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right.

45
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.400
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What did
you think about Angular?

46
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.060
I kind of heard you talking about like,
it's TypeScript.

47
00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.960
This, like in the very
beginning this morning like,

48
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.380
I don't know about TypeScript,
I don't know like,

49
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.440
what was your impressions of
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Actually,

50
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.020
I actually like the type scripts.

51
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.820
I like that it forces you to be
tighter with what you are doing.

52
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.370
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Right,
I like the precision quite a bit.

53
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.210
Was there anything that was just
super confusing and frustrating?

54
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.630
Where it's just like, ugh!

55
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.050
Why haven't they solved this yet?

56
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.440
I didn't really get any sense anybody was
ready to throw a chair through the window.

57
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.510
Although you did take that Core 2000
thing really well this morning.

58
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.590
That would have been
probably a top candidate.

59
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.990
Like, it's a phantom app on this port,
I don't know what's going on.

60
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.250
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm just stalling for
time I guess.

61
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I think it's gonna be a lot
of muscle memory like you're saying,

62
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.160
just maybe

63
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.530
creating the modules my self or
creating the components myself.

64
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.230
Until I really get my head around
how they're are connecting.

65
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.590
But I followed some
tutorials to this point but

66
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.920
it's starting to click where
how they fit together.

67
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.480
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Right.

68
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Catching
myself up on things.

69
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.340
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let me see if i can
actually back out of this real quick.

70
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.150
I will say this as we are waiting for
this to start up.

71
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.985
Occassionally.

72
00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:07.579
Just the
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: web server,

73
00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.080
which is you're doing
a lot of development.

74
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.240
It's just kind of after 40 minutes or

75
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.870
whatever, it's just like
I can't do anymore.

76
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.350
I can't do any more.

77
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.090
Just like I'm gonna die.

78
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.050
Especially if you're switching branches,
sometimes it just gets super weird.

79
00:04:23.044 --> 00:04:28.185
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: To be clear,

80
00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:30.062
the functionality,

81
00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:36.120
there's a balance between doing
something that's approachable.

82
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.490
And doing something
that's actually of value.

83
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.190
So one of the worst things that I hate,
is if you go by a book or

84
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.330
a course, Look,
we're gonna teach you how to this thing.

85
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.060
And then you're doing something that
you would never use in real life,

86
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.890
it's super ugly.

87
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.290
It's just there's very
little apparent utility.

88
00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.610
On the other hand, by choosing something
that you would use in real life.

89
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.430
I think one of the biggest compliments
that somebody could give me.

90
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.130
Is to take a sample
application that I've done, and

91
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.100
go sell it to a client for money.

92
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.540
That would be amazing!

93
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.890
So you have permission to take this,
say, you know what?

94
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:24.080
It says items here, but I'm gonna change
this to, I don't know, cards, or parties.

95
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.830
Or just think of anything
you want to keep track of.

96
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.870
Somebody sells flowers,
your aunt sells flowers or whatever?

97
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.050
You're like,
this is an inventory management system,

98
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.790
please take it and go make some money.

99
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.460
That would be amazing to tell me about.

100
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.050
Free and clear.

101
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.360
The things that are happening in this, and

102
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.400
I recommend everybody
tonight go through master.

103
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.150
Is there's a lot of stuff that
I would use in the real world.

104
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.740
These are real world patterns.

105
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.110
And so to take somebody who is
not familiar with the technology.

106
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.130
And say we're going to go
from zero to actually 60,

107
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.630
or doing something in the real world.

108
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.460
There has to be a level of I think realism
of how long that's actually going to take.

109
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:15.870
And so what I'm showing you here is
the accumulation of years of Angular.

110
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.400
And so I think for

111
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.670
everybody, just have a sense of
the shapes by the time that we leave.

112
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.940
I would be really, really happy.

113
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:27.820
More so, what I would be most happy about
is that everybody is excited about what

114
00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.470
they've learned.

115
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:33.230
And they're going to go do it
next week and the week after, and

116
00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.538
they're still gonna keep hacking.

117
00:06:34.538 --> 00:06:38.150
So, make sense?

118
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.210
But what's happening inside of the search,
I can't wait to talk about it.

119
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.190
It's pretty complicated, it's pretty neat.

120
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.820
Even this whole animation thing.

121
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.680
So, Mattias,
who wrote this animation's module,

122
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.600
I basically called him up, and said,
Look, I need some help with this.

123
00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.310
And so, I get to go in and, I have the
broad strokes, but I get to dig in, and

124
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.250
see what he's done.

125
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.080
So it's even for me, it's, like,
I don't know how this thing is moving.

126
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.160
It's pretty amazing.

127
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.390
Even if you look at this
As yu type this in.

128
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.500
Real nice,
the list is animating in and out.

129
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So
is that part of Angular Materials?

130
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.318
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: No, so this is-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Or just-

131
00:07:16.318 --> 00:07:18.030
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Angular [INAUDIBLE] is

132
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.960
part of, it's not in the core per se,
but it's, well, the angular proper.

133
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.140
So it's not a part of angular material.

134
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.510
So, first question will we learn input and
output component communication tomorrow?

135
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.120
The answer is a resounding yes.

136
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.920
Component driven architecture is&amp;nbsp;
one of my favorite things, with angular.

137
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.850
I can't wait to show it to you.

138
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.763
The next question is
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Any open source

139
00:07:42.763 --> 00:07:45.000
projects put with Angular 4.

140
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.820
So a few people put some
links in to the thing, so

141
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:50.280
I feel like that has been answered.

142
00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.220
The guy at digital signage with
the boilerplate, he kind of,

143
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.420
I think he just went through and tried
to put everything into a single project.

144
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.320
What I would actually recommend is,

145
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.530
I'm a huge fan of redux,
specifically NGRX store.

146
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:12.380
And if you go check out the NGRX
sample app, that to me,

147
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.490
if I were going to write an application,
that's what it would look like.

148
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.508
So it is, let me go to Github, NGRX,

149
00:08:20.508 --> 00:08:26.390
I think it's like...I always
get example and sample.

150
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:30.850
Example app.

151
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:37.990
So this right here,
NGRX example app is pretty close to,

152
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:43.260
if I were to write a real application that
would scale, this is kind of the golden,

153
00:08:47.933 --> 00:08:49.214
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What?

154
00:08:49.214 --> 00:08:51.973
So I would do the 4.x one.

155
00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:55.880
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Snap.

156
00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.900
Who's that handsome fellow?

157
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.050
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I've actually made so
much money with ngrx.

158
00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:08.120
I felt compelled to be like look I'm
tired of pouring champagne on the ground,

159
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.580
take my money.

160
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.520
That's how valuable I think
this particular library is.

161
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.976
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Who is this guy?

162
00:09:16.976 --> 00:09:19.975
Thomas Burleson.

163
00:09:19.975 --> 00:09:21.260
My hero.

164
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:28.968
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
if you actually wanna learn about NgRx,

165
00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:33.260
we have a Reactive course here,
Reactive Angular that I did.

166
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.280
And so
I talk a little about it there as well.

167
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.819
But basically Redux is amazing for
managing state within an application.

168
00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:44.140
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did I see a hand,
I thought?

169
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.360
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So the question is,
will we go over NG Redux?

170
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.970
The answer is no, so

171
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:01.200
we are going to go just right up to
the point of getting into Redux.

172
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:07.620
But that would be a separate course and
I actually prefer NGRX store over redux.

173
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.590
The reason being is because it's based
on observables, which I quite like.

174
00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.021
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So I think redux
the pattern plus RXJS is one of the most

175
00:10:18.021 --> 00:10:20.070
amazing things in the world.
