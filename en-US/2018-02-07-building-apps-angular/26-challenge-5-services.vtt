&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
what I want you to do,

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.640
extract the widgets collection
to a widgets service.

3
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.050
Add the widgets service to the application
module, so those it can be consumed.

4
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.420
Man, I'm just basically
telling you what to do here.

5
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.600
Inject that widgets service into
the widgets component, consume and

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.124
display the new widgets collection.

7
00:00:17.124 --> 00:00:23.070
Now, for bonus,
create a widget interface and

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.330
strongly type selectedWidget
in the widgets collection.

9
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.402
If you get stuck on this, look at what
I'm doing in the items component.
