00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.710
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So this is gonna
be a little bit of a longer one.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.880
I wanna give everybody at least
a half an hour to do this.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.116
So what you want to do is
break your widgets-list and

4
00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:15.710
your widgets-detail form
into two child components.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.280
And then wire them up using Input and
Output.

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.730
So for the widgets list, obviously pass
in the widgets using a widgets-input.

7
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.230
Capture the selected event from
the widgets list, pull it out, and

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.770
then display the selected widget
in the widget-detail component.

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.680
So essentially, what we're doing is taking
what we've already worked on, and we're

10
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.400
just breaking it into two components and
wiring it back up with inputs and outputs.

11
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.330
What I would also do is create a deleted,
saved, and cancelled output.

12
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.900
So, I recommend two things.

13
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.210
One, using item,
the items component, item detail,

14
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.446
item list, see how we're doing it there.

15
00:00:58.446 --> 00:01:00.030
Use that as a reference point for

16
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.210
what we're doing in the widgets,
the pattern is the same.

17
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.642
Also, I've given everybody a hint.

18
00:01:05.642 --> 00:01:10.172
I recommend using,
in this case for the sake of time,

19
00:01:10.172 --> 00:01:15.107
the generator,
is that you can generate widgets-list,

20
00:01:15.107 --> 00:01:19.350
widget-details using
basically this command.

21
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.055
So this is how I do the list but,
obviously,

22
00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:26.461
I think it's pretty easy to figure
out how to do widget details as well.

23
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:32.090
So this is just a little hint I've dropped
at the bottom of this, for reference.

24
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.445
All right, so let's break for lunch.

25
00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:40.700
And so we'll give one hour for lunch and
then 30 minutes for the challenge.

26
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.591
Any questions before I turn you loose?

27
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.455
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Why is everybody so
happy right now?

28
00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:56.570
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In the shared mutable state,

29
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.641
or rather in the state where you
are directly assigning it to the object,

30
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:04.399
if you go back a couple of slides there.

31
00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:11.054
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: You're
talking about this?

32
00:02:11.054 --> 00:02:14.129
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
So if you do, for the time being,

33
00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.090
you can just comment the lines 15 to 18.

34
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.443
And directly have the line

35
00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:27.583
11 have an input.

36
00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:32.260
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So, in fact,
I encourage you when you start out,

37
00:02:37.017 --> 00:02:38.089
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Do this,

38
00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:45.740
input () Item, and tell me what
happens when you start to edit it.

39
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.856
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right, so I did that, okay.

40
00:02:47.856 --> 00:02:49.320
And?

41
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.207
There, what happens is that
when you click on something and

42
00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:55.224
if you edit something here,
it edits into the list directly.

43
00:02:55.224 --> 00:02:56.660
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Shared mutable state.

44
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.777
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, but
the thing is that when we,

45
00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:04.273
I mean does it impact
how the form is loaded?

46
00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:07.340
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: How so?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, the connection; I mean,

47
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.330
this particular component is,
so when you click on

48
00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.332
any of these items, right,
on the parent, okay.

49
00:03:17.332 --> 00:03:21.737
The sub component of the child and
all of its things like form and

50
00:03:21.737 --> 00:03:24.328
everything are initiated already?

51
00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:25.405
Or they are started already?

52
00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:31.950
Because no action has initiated
that component, right?

53
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.530
So that the presentational state of that
component, which the child, what is it?

54
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.667
If you had to put a lifecycle
loop here and put an NGR on it,

55
00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.749
would it say that it is
initialized already?

56
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.520
Because the input and
output have not yet, I mean,

57
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.570
there has been no input to it, okay,
there has been no output to it.

58
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.630
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So
the minute there is, right,

59
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.520
well it will, in this case,
we're sending in an empty object.

60
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.070
We're pre-populating, like so.

61
00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so
will an empty object already come in and

62
00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.570
then that component initialized,
or If I want to say that,

63
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:19.570
don't initialize the component
unless a valid input is in there.

64
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.700
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So if the component's
on the template, on its parent cell,

65
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.010
it's going to get initialized.

66
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.466
It's going to be added to the stage,
unless you use, for instance, ngIf.

67
00:04:29.466 --> 00:04:32.340
So you can say, I mean,
I could do something like this.

68
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.399
So let's say there is no current item.

69
00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:39.059
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And
this may make sense

70
00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:44.340
for,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

71
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.574
in this way, I'm saying don't actually
add this component to the dom until

72
00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:50.550
somebody has selected this.

73
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,
that's what I was looking for.

74
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.970
Okay, that way I don't show the form
unless someone actually goes and selects.

75
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.647
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: But
then how would you create an item?

76
00:05:02.647 --> 00:05:04.947
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, if the same form
is used for both the programs, yes.

77
00:05:04.947 --> 00:05:05.497
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: In some cases,

78
00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:09.257
you may not want to show it until it is
selected, and I've done that as well.

79
00:05:09.257 --> 00:05:11.597
So if somebody is going
to register something,

80
00:05:11.597 --> 00:05:14.341
don't show them the register form until
they click it, it's pretty simple
