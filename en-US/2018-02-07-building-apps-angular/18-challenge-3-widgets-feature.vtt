00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's
take a look at the challenge.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.020
What I would like everybody to do,
after lunch, create the file structure for

3
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.150
a new widgets component.

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.640
Create an ES6 class.

5
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.170
Import the appropriate modules.

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.470
We're decorators, decorate it.

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.344
And display the widgets
component on the home component.

8
00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:29.800
So essentially, what I just did, I would
like everybody to take a stab at it.

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.080
From there, bonus, create a simple route
to view the widgets component by itself.

10
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.480
So hint, app routing module.

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.360
And if you're feeling ready for
a super bonus.

12
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.390
One of the things I like is when
things are fairly conventional,

13
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.830
you can look at the shape and
infer how they work.

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.922
So after you created the route,
if you wanted to add something into

15
00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:58.552
the sidebar,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Play

16
00:00:58.552 --> 00:01:01.594
around with this links array and
see what happens.

17
00:01:05.895 --> 00:01:08.728
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I'm
going to put this up.
