&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I
would just like everyone to do,

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.470
this is going to be like a five minute
challenge, we can skip the bonus.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.247
But, check out the 00- start branch.

4
00:00:09.247 --> 00:00:12.302
Scaffold out a gizmo component
with the module flag.

5
00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:16.730
And also scaffold out a gizmo service
just to see what that looks like.

6
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.230
And then if you have time, you can do MPM
test, MPM build and just see what happens.
