00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.322
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: How do you, if you
first have a collection of things, and

2
00:00:04.322 --> 00:00:07.980
it's obvious that we have routes for
specific containers.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.170
So let's say widgets.

4
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.840
But what if you wanted to navigate
directly to a specific widget?

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.820
How would you do that?

6
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.780
And so this is where route params come in.

7
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.130
So I'm going to walk you
through a quick solution.

8
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.229
And then we can chat about this.

9
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.703
So
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: First and foremost,

10
00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:34.543
when you are saying, when I go to this
URL, I don't wanna see all the items,

11
00:00:34.543 --> 00:00:35.540
for instance.

12
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.730
I wanna see a single item.

13
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.630
So it's the ability to select and view
a single item in a collection dynamically.

14
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.560
And so we need to set up a route for that.

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.508
So using this colon kind of variable
scheme which is pretty common,

16
00:00:55.508 --> 00:00:58.190
that is /:id.

17
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.934
So we're saying in this route
there is a route parameter, and

18
00:01:01.934 --> 00:01:04.961
it's going to be dynamic,
it could be anything.

19
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:09.046
And then,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Within the item

20
00:01:09.046 --> 00:01:12.200
component so I've created this component,
we'll see it in a second.

21
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.288
OnInit we're actually watching

22
00:01:18.288 --> 00:01:23.080
the route paramMap observable.

23
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:32.530
So the parameters on the URL has
essentially been wrapped in an observable.

24
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.440
So your URL or your route is reactive.

25
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.430
In other words when it changes,
you are able to capture that or

26
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.344
subscribe to that observable stream,
cuz again, everything is a stream,

27
00:01:47.344 --> 00:01:51.290
when something happens,
it's happening in the universe.

28
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.217
So this route.paramMap
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: .subscribe,

29
00:01:57.217 --> 00:01:59.395
or we're just saying, so

30
00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:05.240
one is we did subscribe we would be
getting the Params or the Param app.

31
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.180
In this case if you remember switchMap
from yesterday, it's simply saying,

32
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.870
I want to map this stream
to a brand new stream.

33
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.520
So here we're saying paramMap,
this is amble stream,

34
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.440
we're saying when this comes through
I want to take the parameters.

35
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.354
And I'm going to pass it
to the itemsService to get

36
00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:33.050
me the item with these IDs.

37
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.077
So it's saying params.get ( id ).

38
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.057
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so what we're
doing is, when the route comes in or

39
00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:44.004
it changes, cuz you're not
actually refreshing the page,

40
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:48.637
we're able to subscribe to that,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Grab what we

41
00:02:48.637 --> 00:02:53.259
want off of it, send it to a service
that's making a remote call,

42
00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:58.233
returning that observable and
then assigning it to our local object.

43
00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:07.670
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So now, again, state
management, flow control and code volume.

44
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.660
Look at how much we're getting
done in three lines of code.

45
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.221
And now that there's no,
other than the item object itself,

46
00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:18.630
everything else is living in the stream.

47
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.413
And it's all completely
encapsulated in this single stream.

48
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:29.572
This is why our shares,
I'll come over the moon for it.

49
00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:32.190
Because I'm able to do this
in three lines of code.
