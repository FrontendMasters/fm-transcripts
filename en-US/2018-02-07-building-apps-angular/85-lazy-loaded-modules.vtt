00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.311
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Next piece,
lazy loaded modules.

2
00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:05.555
And so this is almost like it sounds,

3
00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:09.856
we're taking a module and
reloading it lazily.

4
00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:14.086
So we'll only load a module
with its assets and

5
00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:18.754
resources when we navigate to it or
when we need it.

6
00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:23.204
And so what this means is,
instead of having one large application,

7
00:00:23.204 --> 00:00:28.130
we can break it up into smaller pieces,
and then just load it when we need it.

8
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.180
So if you have an application where 80% of
the user's time is spent on a single view,

9
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.980
then it may make sense, let's say we have
four other features to make those lazy.

10
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.190
They never have to incur the overhead
of loading those things, so

11
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.770
it's gonna make it that much faster.

12
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.640
And so, this is a pretty easy process to
do this, surprisingly easy, actually.

13
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.490
The first thing to do is to take a,

14
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.170
what would be a component,
and you wrap it in a module.

15
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.850
So what you have to do is you have to

16
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.850
have it where it would be
just a normal component.

17
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.650
Now it has to be a module
that holds the component.

18
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.654
And then within the module,
you set up a route,

19
00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:24.620
just like you would in a normal module.

20
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.650
So you can see here, so
we have this child module, and

21
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.270
we have a single route in this case.

22
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.065
Root path load profile component.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

23
00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:45.150
then what we do, is in our routing table.

24
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.250
Instead of saying, go to this component,
instead we're saying load children.

25
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.260
In other words, go to this resource,
user/user.module.

26
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.680
And so this is the actual file.

27
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.230
And then we're pointing to the actual
module that we're exporting.

28
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.310
We're saying load this in.

29
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.620
So take something you want to make lazy,
wrap it in a module with

30
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:15.860
its own routing, and then in the parent
module, instead of calling it a component,

31
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.100
call load children, and
they see point to the file.

32
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.572
And then the module that you actually
want to load from that file, right here.

33
00:02:28.572 --> 00:02:35.650
So conceivably, you can do this
in just a few lines of code.

34
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.414
And so for instance, this is on
the profile route as you'll notice here,

35
00:02:45.414 --> 00:02:50.753
that at the bottom,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's

36
00:02:50.753 --> 00:02:56.228
loading this user module chunk.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: But you'll only

37
00:02:56.228 --> 00:03:01.360
see this when we go to the profile route.

38
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.640
So, I'll just actually pull this up and

39
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.710
then I'll see, I may or
may not actually do one of these.

40
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.100
So here just refresh this.

41
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.878
So if we go here, you can see like
just a bunch of stuff loading.

42
00:03:22.878 --> 00:03:25.169
[SOUND] Over here, all kinds of stuff so.

43
00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:32.336
Here's all our bundles, everything.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Now

44
00:03:32.336 --> 00:03:34.790
let's go to the profile.

45
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.070
Here and let's see, now is loading in.

46
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.150
The profile information that we need.

47
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.640
And so I think I can, let's see how fast
I can do this in the CLI real quick.

48
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.864
We're kind of in the home stretch and

49
00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:55.547
I really want to at least talk about this
fire base thing for at least a minute.

50
00:03:55.547 --> 00:04:00.389
So let's go ng g m,

51
00:04:07.416 --> 00:04:08.340
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let's see here.

52
00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:17.559
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We're going to create

53
00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:21.140
a refreshments module with routing.

54
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.340
Let me show you one
other thing real quick.

55
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.510
If you ever wonder, did I get this
quite right or what's going to happen?

56
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.865
So sometimes it's like is this going
to generate in the right folder?

57
00:04:30.865 --> 00:04:36.215
I'll do --dry-run, and so you can see
here it's like okay refreshments,

58
00:04:36.215 --> 00:04:41.783
do this it's exactly what I want.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

59
00:04:41.783 --> 00:04:47.780
I'm gonna say generate this module and
spin it up with routing.

60
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.395
So I just pull this up here, and

61
00:04:50.395 --> 00:04:55.405
just went real quick,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: ng g m for

62
00:04:55.405 --> 00:04:59.536
module, refreshments --routing --dry-run,

63
00:04:59.536 --> 00:05:03.949
cuz in this case,
I wanted to just see what would happen.

64
00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.328
All right, let's go ahead and run this.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

65
00:05:09.328 --> 00:05:13.757
then what I'm going to do is ng g c for

66
00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:17.746
component, refreshment, and

67
00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:24.680
let's go energydrink.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I

68
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.700
think that should work.

69
00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:39.472
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So it just did it.

70
00:05:48.295 --> 00:05:48.874
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Did I do this?

71
00:05:48.874 --> 00:05:49.524
I did.

72
00:05:49.524 --> 00:05:51.230
That's what happen, all right.

73
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.400
Let me delete this, let me start over.

74
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.880
I'm so excited.

75
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.090
If only ng lint.

76
00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:03.573
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Refreshments,

77
00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:05.610
all right.

78
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.780
Now let's try this.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Okay, so far, so good.

79
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.915
Let's just jump into this code here.

80
00:06:15.915 --> 00:06:20.651
Routing module.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What is

81
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.326
in every route for
the most part, unless it's lazy?

82
00:06:23.326 --> 00:06:24.696
Path and

83
00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:31.659
component.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Energy

84
00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.626
drink component.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Then let's

85
00:06:36.626 --> 00:06:39.519
go in here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: App routing

86
00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:44.288
module.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And

87
00:06:44.288 --> 00:06:48.869
I suppose I'll do this by hand.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So in this case,

88
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.850
we'll go refreshments.

89
00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.083
So we're just creating the path,
then load children.

90
00:06:53.083 --> 00:07:00.357
And then,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Refreshments,

91
00:07:00.357 --> 00:07:05.463
refreshments, module, refreshments,

92
00:07:05.463 --> 00:07:15.185
module.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I will be so

93
00:07:15.185 --> 00:07:17.455
pleased with myself if
this actually works.

94
00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:18.363
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's probably an error.

95
00:07:18.363 --> 00:07:22.296
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What?

96
00:07:22.296 --> 00:07:23.675
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

97
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.040
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What's gonna work?

98
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.819
Teamwork.

99
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.824
You're awesome, thank you.

100
00:07:30.824 --> 00:07:32.454
I think, let's see here.

101
00:07:36.391 --> 00:07:42.002
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: We could clear

102
00:07:42.002 --> 00:07:47.990
this.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Please work.

103
00:07:57.858 --> 00:07:59.678
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And so what we saw

104
00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:04.824
is,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Let me refresh this

105
00:08:04.824 --> 00:08:14.632
entirely, real quick.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So

106
00:08:14.632 --> 00:08:21.931
it looks like this is the bundle.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: That's interesting.

107
00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:30.469
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So if we go to here,

108
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:34.869
again this user module chunk, and

109
00:08:34.869 --> 00:08:38.215
if we go to refreshments.

110
00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:48.918
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What I'm
not getting the chuck though.

111
00:08:48.918 --> 00:08:50.991
It's there.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Scroll back up just a little

112
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:52.521
bit.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Here?

113
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:54.193
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, down a bit.

114
00:08:54.193 --> 00:08:57.710
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: It's that right there.

115
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right there, refreshment's

116
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.350
model chunk.

117
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:04.069
Just up a little bit from here.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Yes, air five for

118
00:09:04.069 --> 00:09:05.020
the win.

119
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.600
It's almost the weekend.

120
00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.930
I am doing it, everybody.

121
00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:13.484
Look at me.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,

122
00:09:13.484 --> 00:09:17.994
so,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Pretty easy despite

123
00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:19.110
all of my fumbling.

124
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.538
Module just really comes
down to how you load it.

125
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:26.217
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right,

126
00:09:26.217 --> 00:09:30.870
I think I have just a couple more slides
and then we are going to talk about

127
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.917
Fire Base.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Anybody

128
00:09:35.917 --> 00:09:38.310
have any questions about those
two things that I just covered?

129
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.255
Lazy loaded modules?
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Change station

130
00:09:42.255 --> 00:09:43.210
strategy?

131
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.790
This will make your app fast.
