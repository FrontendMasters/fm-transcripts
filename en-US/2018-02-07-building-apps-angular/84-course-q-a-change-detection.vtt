00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.080
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Right, so
let's talk about lazy loaded modules.

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.920
So it depends on the nature of
what is happening in the template.

3
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.430
So if you're binding heavily
to a bunch of internal

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.896
logic that's actually
dialing the template,

5
00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:21.926
then no, you're not gonna wanna do that.

6
00:00:21.926 --> 00:00:29.495
But for the most part what you'll have
is the entire data that's coming in,

7
00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:35.186
that it's being handled
within the observable string.

8
00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:41.563
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And for
that end it's easier to just turn it off,

9
00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:45.910
and call, basically detect changes.

10
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.501
And so that would be my choice, is am
I doing any kind of data manipulation

11
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.775
outside of the observable string?

12
00:00:55.598 --> 00:01:01.100
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: And if I'm doing
a lot, then maybe I might not do that.

13
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.182
But as a whole, especially if I was
at the let's make it fast stage,

14
00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:10.164
that would be,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: One of the first

15
00:01:10.164 --> 00:01:14.788
things that I would do is go through and,
especially at the component level or

16
00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:18.061
the container level of things,
turn that stuff off and

17
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.499
let the observables handle that for us.

18
00:01:22.718 --> 00:01:23.337
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: I mean,

19
00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:28.220
I would say to this that it works
super awesome until it doesn't.

20
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.460
But most of the time that I've done it,
it's worked really well.

21
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.140
Occasionally you'll run into, and
I haven't seen this as much anymore,

22
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.320
a third-party component that didn't
handle turning off change detection.

23
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.772
Because whatever reason internal to
that component, it needed to work.

24
00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:49.292
And so that's where when I've
had to turn it back on or

25
00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:52.940
set it back to default it's because it
didn't play nice with the component.
