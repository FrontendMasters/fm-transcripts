00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.770
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: All right, so
let's do a real quick challenge.

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.450
Actually, let me do a demo real quick,
just so everybody can see how this works.

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.790
I'm gonna do it from this terminal here.

4
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.530
Let me just click.

5
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.369
That's, I think I can do,
well, we'll leave it here for

6
00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:32.095
now.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Git checkout.

7
00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:41.510
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Just revert.

8
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.507
I'm sure there is somebody out there
just being like dude you could have

9
00:00:47.507 --> 00:00:50.935
done that with one command
from the command line.

10
00:00:50.935 --> 00:00:57.413
But, all right, so
ng g in the case of the challenge

11
00:00:57.413 --> 00:01:04.909
I think I do gizmos.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: In this case,

12
00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.150
let's do,
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Burritos.

13
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.690
Now, what's gonna happen is
you're going to see an error

14
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
because there is more than
one module in the room.

15
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.147
So if we go ng g c burritos -m app.,

16
00:01:22.147 --> 00:01:26.569
let's see if it actually.

17
00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:33.390
Now you notice that it created CSS,
HTML, a spec, the texture file.

18
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.790
And then it added it to the app module.

19
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.610
Pretty handy.

20
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.606
And, if we go into our app modulary,

21
00:01:43.606 --> 00:01:48.390
you can see it's been
added as a declaration.

22
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.106
And from here if we go
to the home component

23
00:01:54.106 --> 00:02:00.646
template.
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Well,

24
00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:03.740
actually, let's do this.

25
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.140
Generally, what it will do is attach
to this prefix, in this case it's app.

26
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.561
So it's app-burritos, and so
if I go to home component,

27
00:02:17.246 --> 00:02:19.119
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: app-burritos,

28
00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:22.370
let's see what happens here.

29
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:33.037
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: Wait for it.

30
00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:47.974
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: What happens if I

31
00:02:47.974 --> 00:02:49.645
refresh?

32
00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:52.103
There we go.
