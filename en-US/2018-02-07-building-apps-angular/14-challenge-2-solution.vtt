00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.770
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So was everybody
here able to generate a component?

2
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.470
Pretty easy, right?

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.190
And the big thing here is
that if you step through and

4
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.080
you look at these components,
they're pretty much all the same.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:20.264
See it says HTML, Spec, TS and
that's enforced also by your lint.

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.982
So this is, let me see here.

7
00:00:35.383 --> 00:00:36.366
&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So using ng lint,

8
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.430
hopefully this will pass.

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.840
Yeah.
Not a lot here, but you can check and see.

10
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.230
Like did somebody mess something up?

11
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.640
In fact, you can even run it with a flag
that will actually fix your linting error

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.060
so if you missed a space or something,
the CLI would just fix that for you.

13
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.740
So, handy robot army, I love it.
