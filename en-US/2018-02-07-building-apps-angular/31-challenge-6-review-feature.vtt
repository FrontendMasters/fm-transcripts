&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Let us do a review.

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.620
So this is gonna be
pretty straight forward.

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.550
In your working example,
create a new review feature.

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.750
So include the file structure,
component class, and template.

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.880
And then make it available to
the rest of the application.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.820
And then what I would like you to
do is display the review component

7
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.730
in the application using its selector,
and then also via a route.

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.990
This is kind of like our
original challenge yesterday.

9
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.945
And then from there, just bind to
a simple property in the template.

10
00:00:40.945 --> 00:00:43.314
So this could be name whatever.

11
00:00:43.314 --> 00:00:45.370
And then just create a small array and

12
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.300
use a built in directive to
display that on the page.
