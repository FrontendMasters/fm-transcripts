&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: We
had some questions about,

2
00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.370
are we going to talk about how
to integrate with a back end?

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.130
And the answer is yes, let me explain
what is happening in this application.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.435
So the reason why we're using
npm-start and not ng serve is because

5
00:00:16.435 --> 00:00:21.550
concurrently, we're running not
only the Angular CLI server,

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.000
but we're running a small JSON server.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.073
And so you see this npm run server,
and what JSON server

8
00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:36.172
does is it takes a,
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: Basically

9
00:00:36.172 --> 00:00:39.836
a static JSON file and
converts it into a REST API.

10
00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:43.226
And so if we go to port 3000,

11
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:50.239
&gt;&gt; Lucas Ruebbelke: You can see here that

12
00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.750
we have two endpoints, items and widgets,
and so let me just boost this up.

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.880
And so, you can see here that it takes
essentially a key value collection, and

14
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.180
it turns it into a REST API here.

15
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.520
So now, items for instance, so
then you do forward slash one.

16
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.150
And it will return just this one, so

17
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.970
this is a really, really convenient
way to spin up a REST API.

18
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.880
So if don't take anything else today,
take this hashtag protip,

19
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.980
this is the easiest way
to get a REST API up and

20
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.380
running, is if you can just right out
in JSON, then boom you have a REST API.

21
00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.340
Insomuch that, because rest is
conventional, like the verb, so

22
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.210
once you understand it you
can just do it all day long.

23
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.930
It doesn't matter if you're on .Net,
Ruby, whatever.

24
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.198
Is that I have been on projects
where the front-end team that

25
00:01:47.198 --> 00:01:53.830
I was on was working faster than
the back-end team could produce REST APIs.

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.431
But because we agreed on the shape and the
endpoints, we just did it in JSON server,

27
00:01:58.431 --> 00:02:02.792
and when they finished we just swapped
the endpoints out and we were good to go.

28
00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:07.894
So the point is yes, we're going to
talk about how to integrate with

29
00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:13.730
the back end via a REST API, we are just
running a very lightweight local one.

30
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.970
And so that is what is happening here.

31
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.890
So we're basically running
the front end app on port 4200, and

32
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.746
the back end REST API on port 3000.
