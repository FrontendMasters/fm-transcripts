&gt;&gt; Lukas Ruebbelke: So we covered
quite a bit of ground yesterday.

2
00:00:03.112 --> 00:00:06.255
And we're going to start with a review,

3
00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:10.790
just to kind of a little conversation,
what did we cover.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.570
A little bit of a review challenge.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.340
And then we get into forms.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.370
And then driven architecture, my favorite.

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.871
And we'll take it from there.

8
00:00:19.871 --> 00:00:24.808
But, today my goal is to
expand what we learned

9
00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:28.986
about features or building a feature,

10
00:00:28.986 --> 00:00:33.937
for the most part,
a component and a service.

11
00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:38.798
And extend that knowledge
to include how to actually

12
00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:43.224
construct multiple components and
features.

13
00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:47.953
And how to have them fit together and
work together, because, at least for

14
00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:51.034
me, every non-trivial
application that I've

15
00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:54.430
worked on has has done more
than one thing, usually.

16
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.890
Like you might want to actually register
a user, update some information on or

17
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.460
maybe some collection of, let's say, like
payroll and customer information, etc.

18
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.280
Well, eventually there needs to be kind of
some sanity about how all these features

19
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.540
converge and they communicate and
share state, etc.

20
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.410
So, this is the goal for
today, is expanding on

21
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.070
how we build a single feature,
which is pretty much a component and

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.540
a service, to how do we kind of fit
them together and make them talk?

23
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.986
So, the agenda today is we're
going to do a review challenge.

24
00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:38.169
So just to kind of shake off the cobwebs,
and

25
00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:43.157
just go over kind of what we learned,
reinforce it.

26
00:01:43.157 --> 00:01:45.871
And then we'll talk about
template driven forms,

27
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:49.690
component driven architecture,
server communications.

28
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.960
Then we're going to get into
observable fundamentals.

29
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.460
So observables are easily one of my
favorite things in programming right now.

30
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.910
And from there, reactive forms,
and if we have time, animations.
