WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.420
So setting the language and fixing markup.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.510
So one easy win that you can
do on a lot of web pages.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.334
And this is something that x
will advise you to do is to put

4
00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:15.090
a language on your pages.

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.557
So if there's one overall language,
English for example,

6
00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:23.347
we can put HTML Lang equals en for
English.

7
00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:27.637
And that will actually have a pretty
profound effect on assistive technology.

8
00:00:27.637 --> 00:00:31.045
So depending on how the content
is like what language it's in,

9
00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:34.687
the screen reader will
change its pronunciation.

10
00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:36.467
And it's really cool.

11
00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:40.582
So for sites with multiple languages,
maybe you could change it in a template

12
00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.381
depending on what language
you're rendering out.

13
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:48.551
There is page level versus
element level language.

14
00:00:48.551 --> 00:00:52.065
So if you have a site that's
mostly in English, but

15
00:00:52.065 --> 00:00:56.888
you have some elements on it that
are in French or some other language,

16
00:00:56.888 --> 00:01:02.488
you can actually kind of override the page
level language on a per element basis.

17
00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:07.999
So if I have a paragraph
with lang = fr within a lang

18
00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:13.658
equals in that one paragraph
will sound francais.

19
00:01:13.658 --> 00:01:17.580
[LAUGH] It'll sound different and
you can hear it in the screen reader.

20
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.150
It's pretty awesome.

21
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.643
So if you had a whole page of French and

22
00:01:21.643 --> 00:01:26.150
it was marked up as laggy and
it would be excruciating to listen to,

23
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.139
if you like the worst pronunciation ever,
but actually the screen reader

24
00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:35.672
can do a way better job if you tell
it what language it needs to be in.

25
00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:38.273
I think we even have an example.

26
00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:44.066
So I have a stack blitz here in the
project that we can actually fire up and

27
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:44.656
test.

28
00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:46.566
So let's try that real quick.

29
00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:49.846
I am going to put it on preview mode.

30
00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:54.926
So StackBlitz itself is
probably not that accessible.

31
00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:58.766
A lot of these tools,
I want them to be more accessible.

32
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.703
But often when you're testing.

33
00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:03.852
If you can open the little
demo project in a new window,

34
00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:07.621
sometimes that will isolate it so
that the screen reader doesn't

35
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:10.793
get tripped up on other UI
elements of the tool itself.

36
00:02:10.793 --> 00:02:15.743
So I'm going to turn on Voiceover
with function Command F5.

37
00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:20.512
&gt;&gt; Navigation, visited,
linked, heading level one.

38
00:02:20.512 --> 00:02:26.663
Web accessibility v3, home,
frame preview page group you are currently

39
00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:33.219
on a frame to an https:// web-flat
https:// web-platform-li6 gwd.

40
00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.863
Heading level 2, heading level 1,
french recipes heading level 2,

41
00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:40.538
you are currently on a heading level two.

42
00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:41.575
&gt;&gt; That didn't work, did it [LAUGH]?

43
00:02:41.575 --> 00:02:43.253
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] To exit this way.

44
00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:46.975
&gt;&gt; Voivodigdin, so that's what it
sounds like when it doesn't work.

45
00:02:46.975 --> 00:02:50.895
[LAUGH] That was so terrible.

46
00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.590
&gt;&gt; Jithub, anyone?

47
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.423
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver off.

48
00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:54.618
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that didn't work at all.

49
00:02:54.618 --> 00:02:56.651
So that could be Chrome.

50
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:59.333
It totally worked when it
didn't when I tested it.

51
00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:01.743
So it does have the Lang FR.

52
00:03:01.743 --> 00:03:05.183
That could be reason enough
to open this up in Safari.

53
00:03:05.183 --> 00:03:10.863
So because I am committed to this,
I am going to go open it up and see.

54
00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.985
We'll see maybe our first difference.

55
00:03:15.985 --> 00:03:17.966
If stack blitz will load, it will.

56
00:03:17.966 --> 00:03:21.596
Okay, so I'm gonna fire it
up again function command f5

57
00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:24.224
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver on Safari set recipes.

58
00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:27.341
You are heading level one,
heading level two boa four chignon.

59
00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:29.796
&gt;&gt; No,
&gt;&gt; You are heading level one French

60
00:03:29.796 --> 00:03:30.477
recipes.

61
00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:33.322
You are heading level
two boa four chignon.

62
00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:35.782
You are currently on the heading
level two inside of the frame.

63
00:03:35.782 --> 00:03:38.145
The Character palette close by Safari.

64
00:03:38.145 --> 00:03:40.844
Setting the language and
fix the VoiceOver off.

65
00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:42.535
&gt;&gt; Sad face emoji.

66
00:03:42.535 --> 00:03:47.601
Well, the demo gods were not blessing us
in this example and I have no idea why.

67
00:03:48.711 --> 00:03:50.961
Maybe it's something was stack Blitz.

68
00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:55.711
I think when I tested it, it was not
embedded within the slide window itself.

69
00:03:56.881 --> 00:04:01.660
So we have to test Stuff periodically and
I swear VoiceOver will do that sometimes

70
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.330
where you're like, wait,
that worked and then it didn't.

71
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.025
But we're like embedding
windows within windows, so

72
00:04:10.025 --> 00:04:14.315
all bets are off if it'll be beef
bourguignon or beef bourguignon.

73
00:04:14.315 --> 00:04:16.303
That's pretty funny though.

74
00:04:16.303 --> 00:04:21.426
[LAUGH] At least you can see
the kind of what happens when you

75
00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:27.425
don't have the attribute so
it's informative in that way, fun.

76
00:04:27.425 --> 00:04:31.985
[LAUGH] Okay, well,
I'm going to close out of Safari.

77
00:04:31.985 --> 00:04:33.897
That was a fun little experiment.

78
00:04:33.897 --> 00:04:38.767
&gt;&gt; I often find engineers use the button
tag for a link usually because they need

79
00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:42.284
an uncle Click handler for
something like analytics?

80
00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:47.172
For example, pushing to the route in
a function when the next router, instead

81
00:04:47.172 --> 00:04:51.983
of using an actual link, what would be
the best way to correctly handle this so

82
00:04:51.983 --> 00:04:55.185
that a link is a link, but
it also calls a function?

83
00:04:57.575 --> 00:05:01.782
&gt;&gt; Well, I think, yeah,
it's gonna depend on your router for one.

84
00:05:01.782 --> 00:05:06.098
I haven't had to use a router
in a little while and

85
00:05:06.098 --> 00:05:10.732
you'll learn why,
[LAUGH] this week for sure.

86
00:05:10.732 --> 00:05:11.793
But I think if,

87
00:05:11.793 --> 00:05:16.552
like I've seen a lot of buttons that
should be links in the code base.

88
00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:21.235
I'm working on and I think sometimes
styles are the constraint, like,

89
00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:25.766
if you're dealing with old styles
that everyone's afraid to touch,

90
00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:28.636
that can be a reason
why the stuff persists.

91
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:32.107
So to try and solve that, yeah,

92
00:05:32.107 --> 00:05:37.120
I guess I'd have to see,
can you put a, like,

93
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:43.823
maybe an event listener on the element and
the RF for the link.

94
00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:48.373
That's just kind of talking you through
my process of what I would try is to see

95
00:05:48.373 --> 00:05:52.503
if you can register a click event
that doesn't do any navigating, but

96
00:05:52.503 --> 00:05:55.673
will kind of capture that analytics event.

97
00:05:55.673 --> 00:05:58.165
Especially if it's client side routed,
I guess.

98
00:05:58.165 --> 00:06:04.015
One thing I would be looking out for is
if the default HTML navigation with href,

99
00:06:04.015 --> 00:06:09.080
if it wasn't client-side routed,
it would probably refresh, and

100
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.185
you may or may not see that click event to
get that, capture that analytics event.

101
00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:18.963
But, if it is client-side routed,
if it's not gonna refresh page.

102
00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:23.759
So theoretically, maybe you could
do a click event and an href, but

103
00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.833
I'm not totally certain that would work.

104
00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:29.503
That's kind of just my thought process.

105
00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:32.953
Because often there
are constraints like that.

106
00:06:32.953 --> 00:06:34.973
Like, why does this happen this way?

107
00:06:36.153 --> 00:06:37.413
It's not by choice.

108
00:06:37.413 --> 00:06:41.556
It's just because of whatever we're
trying to navigate through at work.

109
00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:46.519
So I think in an ideal world, we do want
to try and make links look like links and

110
00:06:46.519 --> 00:06:47.841
buttons look like buttons.

111
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:51.833
But I can say from experience that
that's just not always what happens.
