WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.761
&gt;&gt; Marcy: Let's do an exercise
on debugging some webpages.

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.160
We went through some steps earlier,
so here they are recapped.

3
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.730
We're gonna test with the keyboard,
can we reach, operate, and

4
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.040
see every focused interactive control.

5
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.521
So things that mouse users can do,
can we do that with the keyboard.

6
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:22.685
We're gonna use Browser DevTools and
extensions,

7
00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:26.850
including axe,
the Accessibility Inspector, and

8
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.496
Chrome DevTools itself,
we'll zoom in and test Reflow.

9
00:00:31.496 --> 00:00:36.671
We probably won't fire up a screen reader
at this point just for time purposes,

10
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:41.706
but that is something that I put kind of
further down the list to do regularly.

11
00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:44.880
We'll look at things like motion and
color contrast,

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.334
some of which will come up in
things like the axe extension.

13
00:00:48.334 --> 00:00:53.706
And then if I'm checking things kind
of broadly, if there's any videos or

14
00:00:53.706 --> 00:00:58.412
media, I make a note to ask my team for
captions and transcripts.

15
00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:03.698
Cuz if nobody brings it up,
it might never ever get included

16
00:01:03.698 --> 00:01:09.263
on the site, and
then someone is totally excluded.

17
00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:15.763
So better late than never to say, hey, we
need to generate some captioned content.

18
00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:20.467
So I have some sites that we could try,
if you have a site that you're working on

19
00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:23.250
that's probably a great
thing to check out and

20
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.128
get a picture on what's
happening on the site.

21
00:01:26.128 --> 00:01:29.496
But I have some different categories here,
I love music, so

22
00:01:29.496 --> 00:01:31.156
I was gonna test SoundCloud.

23
00:01:32.806 --> 00:01:36.726
News websites are notoriously terrible,
e-commerce,

24
00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:39.529
there's some great that could use help.

25
00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:43.190
Target's actually pretty
good cuz they were sued,

26
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.778
and so
it's become part of their regular process.

27
00:01:48.098 --> 00:01:53.108
Productivity apps like Google Docs, I
have a Google Doc that you can check out.

28
00:01:53.108 --> 00:02:00.308
And those apps are really advanced,
like the Google Drive applications,

29
00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:05.920
they put a lot of effort into
accessibility, bless them.

30
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.279
They're putting in the effort, we'll have
to ask users how is it working for them.

31
00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.714
But there are some really cool
accessibility techniques in

32
00:02:14.714 --> 00:02:15.888
some of those apps.

33
00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:30.174
&gt;&gt; Marcy: So, let's open up an app and
test it, let's test SoundCloud.

34
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.172
&gt;&gt; Marcy: Hopefully it
won't just start playing.

35
00:02:35.172 --> 00:02:40.080
So I follow a lot of record labels,
I listen to music all the time,

36
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.305
and so
I have a ton of content saved in here.

37
00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:48.290
I like that it has lots of
interactive components on it, so

38
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.442
it's got lots of links.

39
00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:55.256
First step, I hit the tab key,
I do not see a focus style.

40
00:02:55.256 --> 00:02:56.746
So interestingly enough,

41
00:02:56.746 --> 00:03:00.510
I mentioned earlier I made a blog
of wins called Accessibility Wins.

42
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.923
And this is the first site I gave
a win to, and it has degraded for

43
00:03:04.923 --> 00:03:06.935
accessibility since then.

44
00:03:06.935 --> 00:03:11.543
I have to recall that win, I think,
unfortunately, teams change,

45
00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:12.900
software changes.

46
00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.001
So the focus style on the feed
button is very faint,

47
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:22.154
it went from gray on
gray to white on gray,

48
00:03:22.154 --> 00:03:26.917
that is not sufficient at all for
a focus style.

49
00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:32.628
We should just show an outline, something
that has enough contrast from the items

50
00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:38.437
around it that you can tell what is focus,
cuz that's just not really acceptable.

51
00:03:38.437 --> 00:03:43.129
So if I keep tabbing,
now I'm in the search box,

52
00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.747
I can skip, I think maybe
the search button is focusable.

53
00:03:48.747 --> 00:03:51.755
So the first thing I'm gonna go inspect,
so

54
00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:56.000
I'm gonna go inspect why I had
a tab stop that I couldn't see.

55
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.895
So I'm gonna do control-click,
inspect, and

56
00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:03.510
I'll make the DevTools
a little bit bigger.

57
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.348
So this button over here, I see I've
got the input, I've got a button,

58
00:04:09.348 --> 00:04:14.927
and in Chrome DevTools, in this
little hover, I can click on focus.

59
00:04:14.927 --> 00:04:18.537
There's our first big
keyboard accessibility issue,

60
00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:23.771
there is an outline of zero on these
elements, looks like header search submit.

61
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:27.084
So they were very specific
about suppressing the focus

62
00:04:27.084 --> 00:04:28.457
style on this button.

63
00:04:28.457 --> 00:04:33.781
If I uncheck that,
there's probably another one somewhere,

64
00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:37.370
cuz I don't see a focus style.

65
00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.305
So there might be multiple things
that are causing this, and

66
00:04:41.305 --> 00:04:46.410
I'd have to go digging, cuz it should
just show a focus style, but it's not.

67
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.949
Sometimes focus might not
be the pseudo selector,

68
00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:54.272
maybe focus visible could be another one.

69
00:04:54.272 --> 00:05:00.201
That's a newer selector that tries to
exclude mouse focus from keyboard focus,

70
00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:03.360
it can be pretty helpful sometimes.

71
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.083
Wait, that worked, I just noticed,
when I selected focus visible,

72
00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:12.977
I did get the default outline,
so there you go.

73
00:05:12.977 --> 00:05:17.686
But that's an issue that I can surface
pretty quickly just by tabbing and

74
00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:23.167
then inspecting the CSS for a given
element cuz that should be focusable.

75
00:05:23.167 --> 00:05:25.554
It should show style, so
I can see where I am.

76
00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:30.227
This blue border doesn't look great
because there's no padding on the icon.

77
00:05:30.227 --> 00:05:33.369
So if I put padding on it in the button,

78
00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:39.083
it will add a little bit of space
around the icon so I can see around it.

79
00:05:39.083 --> 00:05:41.608
And you can even do
a custom focus style too,

80
00:05:41.608 --> 00:05:45.097
you don't have to use the default one but
it is pretty handy.

81
00:05:46.437 --> 00:05:51.202
So I'm gonna reset that and I'm gonna
click back in that search field just so

82
00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:55.612
I know that my keyboard focus is in
the browser and not in the DevTools.

83
00:05:55.612 --> 00:05:59.842
And I'm gonna keep tabbing,
get to some other widgets.

84
00:05:59.842 --> 00:06:02.996
So a real lack of focus styles
that are visible on some of these,

85
00:06:02.996 --> 00:06:07.592
like a little carrot changing color
to white, that's just not sufficient.

86
00:06:07.592 --> 00:06:11.511
But it is accessible otherwise,
I can hit Enter and

87
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:17.005
open this little profile thing,
I can tab into these items.

88
00:06:17.005 --> 00:06:21.935
It does some wrapping so
my focus goes around, that's pretty cool.

89
00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:25.205
I think I can hit escape and
go back, the bones are there.

90
00:06:25.205 --> 00:06:30.105
There's some tweaks that they could make,
they did make that component, at least

91
00:06:30.105 --> 00:06:35.630
keyboard accessible except for the focus
style kind of not really being sufficient.

92
00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:36.495
So that's good news though, right?

93
00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:42.042
It's like something we can work with that,
we don't have to completely rip it out and

94
00:06:42.042 --> 00:06:45.447
start over,
it might just be some simple CSS fixes.

95
00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:50.790
So let's run axe on this,
we'll see what kind of issues it finds.

96
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.429
When I ran it earlier,
there were a ton, I think 248 or

97
00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:59.117
something, so it's got quite a few issues.

98
00:06:59.117 --> 00:07:03.928
Best practices are on,
if I turn those off, that was only a few.

99
00:07:03.928 --> 00:07:08.697
So the difference there is that best
practices are things like landmark

100
00:07:08.697 --> 00:07:12.282
elements that are great,
but not totally required.

101
00:07:12.282 --> 00:07:16.050
Whereas WCAG violations are the things
that you should fix first.

102
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.783
Those are the ones that, if you were sued,

103
00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:24.877
they wouldn't sue you over best practices,
basically.

104
00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:27.989
But there's lots of
interesting things in here,

105
00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:31.187
like elements must only
use permitted ARIA rolls.

106
00:07:31.187 --> 00:07:36.085
So one reason why I mentioned kind of
taking a pause before slapping ARIA on

107
00:07:36.085 --> 00:07:40.274
everything is there's some
requirements that you kind of have

108
00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:43.923
to learn everything related
to a given RNA attribute.

109
00:07:43.923 --> 00:07:47.143
Are there other roles that
it has to work with or

110
00:07:47.143 --> 00:07:51.364
certain roles that it's required or
it will only work with.

111
00:07:51.364 --> 00:07:56.416
So this one is complaining that you
can't use ARIA label on a span.

112
00:07:56.416 --> 00:08:02.630
And actually this is a typo, so
aria-role is not an attribute.

113
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.980
It's close, it's role image.

114
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.256
So like,
that's a really subtle error that,

115
00:08:09.256 --> 00:08:13.460
if I was scanning it with my eyes,
maybe I would catch that.

116
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.570
But the computer's pretty good at
pointing this stuff out to us.

117
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.789
And there's probably an issue in here.

118
00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:25.012
About
aria-attributes-must-conform-to-valid-na-

119
00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:27.747
mes.
So yeah, there is a rule in here that will

120
00:08:27.747 --> 00:08:32.299
tell us that aria-role is not a real
attribute cuz we can't make them up.

121
00:08:32.299 --> 00:08:35.289
There's a standard set of role,
states, and properties.

122
00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:40.034
So Axe is doing a really great job
here of surfacing some issues that

123
00:08:40.034 --> 00:08:41.993
are kind of easy mistakes.

124
00:08:41.993 --> 00:08:47.143
I mean, it's an easy fix, but
it's an easy thing to mess up to.

125
00:08:47.143 --> 00:08:49.573
So fortunately,
our tooling is really great.

126
00:08:49.573 --> 00:08:51.083
And it's surfacing that for us now.

127
00:08:52.483 --> 00:08:55.523
So some things about acts
I could point out too,

128
00:08:55.523 --> 00:08:59.551
like if I need to see what element
this is, I can do highlight and

129
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:04.499
it'll highlight it and the pink up there
on the screen, that can be helpful.

130
00:09:05.499 --> 00:09:10.066
Sometimes it'll report things that are not
even visible, maybe they have screen

131
00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:14.319
reader only on them or something and
just in a state that you didn't expect.

132
00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:18.099
So highlight can help to get you
to that where it is on the page.

133
00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:21.237
And then there's also this
little inspect element.

134
00:09:21.237 --> 00:09:22.237
That one I use a lot.

135
00:09:22.237 --> 00:09:24.957
It'll jump me over to
the elements inspector.

136
00:09:24.957 --> 00:09:27.347
And I can go over here and
look at an element.

137
00:09:28.427 --> 00:09:32.007
We talked earlier about alt text for
images.

138
00:09:32.007 --> 00:09:36.247
So to circle back to that, there's
a tool in here that you must know about.

139
00:09:37.437 --> 00:09:40.693
So over here next to styles
computed layout, etc.

140
00:09:40.693 --> 00:09:44.663
The little carrot icon,
there is an accessibility inspector.

141
00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:45.993
This is your new best friend.

142
00:09:47.143 --> 00:09:49.513
It's amazing, I love this tool.

143
00:09:49.513 --> 00:09:52.443
Here's our next mention of
the accessibility tree.

144
00:09:52.443 --> 00:09:55.273
So this is sort of parallel to the DOM.

145
00:09:55.273 --> 00:10:01.132
It will highlight all of the accessibility
information that is in the DOM.

146
00:10:01.132 --> 00:10:03.002
And for an image.

147
00:10:04.102 --> 00:10:05.592
So this is interesting.

148
00:10:05.592 --> 00:10:10.652
So it's showing us that the role because
that Aria role is not a real attribute.

149
00:10:10.652 --> 00:10:12.572
It should be role.

150
00:10:12.572 --> 00:10:14.542
It will say its role is generic.

151
00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:19.322
Whereas if I change this
to role this will update.

152
00:10:19.322 --> 00:10:21.323
And now it has a role of image.

153
00:10:21.323 --> 00:10:24.343
That was just a soft
edit in the dev tools.

154
00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:27.278
You'd have to go change it
in your real code base, but

155
00:10:27.278 --> 00:10:30.853
I could at least fiddle with
it here in the browser.

156
00:10:30.853 --> 00:10:34.753
And this will show me which thing wins.

157
00:10:34.753 --> 00:10:38.082
So like if I had an aria labeled
by pointing to some other element,

158
00:10:38.082 --> 00:10:39.369
I could see if it worked.

159
00:10:39.369 --> 00:10:44.204
And this is the question about how much
we should test with a screen reader,

160
00:10:44.204 --> 00:10:46.123
you should start with this for

161
00:10:46.123 --> 00:10:50.876
sure, because this is what the screen
reader is going to look at.

162
00:10:50.876 --> 00:10:55.530
It's going to look at the accessibility
tree and all of these computed properties

163
00:10:55.530 --> 00:11:00.249
and everything, you can get most of the
way there just by using this tool and ax.

164
00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:05.860
Like if you clean up all that stuff and do
the debugging, you'll get like pretty far.

165
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.797
So for your alt text like fallback
trying to style that, for

166
00:11:09.797 --> 00:11:15.312
those techniques you could go and inspect
like what is actually getting spit out for

167
00:11:15.312 --> 00:11:18.097
the screen reader like did my technique.

168
00:11:18.097 --> 00:11:22.156
Did I accidentally hide it from
every screen reader user, or

169
00:11:22.156 --> 00:11:25.992
is it actually picking up
the text in the way that I hoped?

170
00:11:27.442 --> 00:11:29.032
So this one's pretty essential.

171
00:11:29.032 --> 00:11:33.662
Yeah, it's amazing to me
how hidden this tool is.

172
00:11:33.662 --> 00:11:36.532
It's so powerful and so helpful.

173
00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:37.212
Now you know what?

174
00:11:37.212 --> 00:11:38.587
It's there, if you didn't already.

175
00:11:38.587 --> 00:11:45.604
Okay, so dev tools, that's super helpful.

176
00:11:45.604 --> 00:11:51.023
If I go back to x, let me zoom this out
at one level, I wanna see some contrast

177
00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:57.004
issues because that is a lot of the
accessibility issues are contrast-related.

178
00:11:57.004 --> 00:12:00.476
And so this says that it
ensures that the foreground and

179
00:12:00.476 --> 00:12:04.491
background colors meet
the minimum contrast ratio.

180
00:12:04.491 --> 00:12:09.321
So depending on the font size,
this is a small font size.

181
00:12:09.321 --> 00:12:12.791
I guess I'm gonna highlight so I know
which element we're talking about here.

182
00:12:12.791 --> 00:12:16.726
It's the orange trigon plus
text on a gray background.

183
00:12:16.726 --> 00:12:21.953
It almost looks like it
could meet the ratio.

184
00:12:21.953 --> 00:12:24.723
So it needs to be 4.5 to 1.

185
00:12:24.723 --> 00:12:28.153
We can calculate the ratio of values.

186
00:12:28.153 --> 00:12:32.855
Is there enough of a difference
that it has a ratio of at least

187
00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:36.053
4.5 to 1 at 14 pixels?

188
00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:40.757
It has to be at least 18 points or
24 pixels to get above

189
00:12:40.757 --> 00:12:46.062
a threshold where it's big enough
that it only has to be 3 to1.

190
00:12:46.062 --> 00:12:52.945
This doesn't meet that size threshold, so
it has to be 4.51, and it's only 3.941.

191
00:12:52.945 --> 00:12:56.387
So that's pretty close, but not quite.

192
00:12:56.387 --> 00:12:58.829
So we would want to go in, in this case,

193
00:12:58.829 --> 00:13:03.938
it's kind of tough because that's
the SoundCloud orange on the gray banner.

194
00:13:03.938 --> 00:13:10.308
So our options are make the orange
darker or make the gray lighter.

195
00:13:10.308 --> 00:13:12.258
I don't know,
I guess that's kind of a mind bender.

196
00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:13.558
what direction do you have to go?

197
00:13:13.558 --> 00:13:17.458
You'd have to change those colors,
maybe we can fiddle with it.

198
00:13:17.458 --> 00:13:22.130
So what I wanna try is see if I can change
the orange just enough to get to that 4.5

199
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.637
to 1,
because sometimes that's the solution.

200
00:13:25.637 --> 00:13:29.383
If it's off enough, or you have to make it
brown and it looks terrible, you're going

201
00:13:29.383 --> 00:13:33.017
to have to talk to your design team
because it's like, you can't fake it.

202
00:13:33.017 --> 00:13:34.972
They're going to be like,
why is this brown?

203
00:13:34.972 --> 00:13:40.386
[LAUGH] Because I was trying to make
it match contrast ratios, you can't.

204
00:13:40.386 --> 00:13:43.766
But sometimes you can just tweak
it enough, so let's go see.

205
00:13:46.276 --> 00:13:50.955
This element is try-go, so
if I go to inspect related node, and

206
00:13:50.955 --> 00:13:53.046
I go back over to the styles.

207
00:13:55.526 --> 00:13:58.986
If I lose it somehow,
I can go control-click and inspect it.

208
00:13:58.986 --> 00:14:01.259
So I know this element has an issue.

209
00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:05.039
This orange color, nice, it worked.

210
00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:07.219
So Chrome has a contrast tool.

211
00:14:07.219 --> 00:14:08.129
It doesn't always work.

212
00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:11.750
I think it has to do with
where the background is,

213
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.099
like what element it's set on.

214
00:14:14.099 --> 00:14:17.466
It's very murky to me why it
works sometimes it doesn't, but

215
00:14:17.466 --> 00:14:19.789
this time it worked, excellent.

216
00:14:19.789 --> 00:14:22.398
So it shows me this ratio.

217
00:14:22.398 --> 00:14:24.175
I didn't mean to open that.

218
00:14:24.175 --> 00:14:26.848
There's a little caret here,
I can expand it.

219
00:14:26.848 --> 00:14:29.358
So there's double A, it needs to meet 4.5.

220
00:14:29.358 --> 00:14:32.384
If you're really like swinging for
the fences and

221
00:14:32.384 --> 00:14:35.913
you want to hit triple A,
which is like a higher standard,

222
00:14:35.913 --> 00:14:40.831
most companies or organizations don't go
for that, that would be seven to one.

223
00:14:40.831 --> 00:14:44.851
It would mean more people
could see the colors, but

224
00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:49.258
AA is kind of the agreed upon standard for
the most part.

225
00:14:49.258 --> 00:14:54.445
So this contrast picker,
the reason I love it is I can drag.

226
00:14:54.445 --> 00:14:55.465
I can go like this.

227
00:14:55.465 --> 00:14:57.635
Drag down the colors.

228
00:14:57.635 --> 00:14:59.395
I'm going the wrong direction.

229
00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:05.560
So if I need to get up to 4.5 to one,
I'm dragging over towards the white.

230
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.890
And I just got it and
I can barely perceive a difference.

231
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.770
So this one I could fiddle with, I think,
without having to go back to my team.

232
00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.780
See if they notice.

233
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.411
This is a ask for
forgiveness situation, I think.

234
00:15:21.411 --> 00:15:26.001
You just sort of change your color
config to something that passes.

235
00:15:26.001 --> 00:15:29.287
And then every element that had that
color would benefit from it and

236
00:15:29.287 --> 00:15:31.571
you could fix it in one go, hopefully.

237
00:15:31.571 --> 00:15:33.071
Let's see what the selector looks like.

238
00:15:33.071 --> 00:15:40.071
So this color,
it's used on multiple elements for sure.

239
00:15:40.071 --> 00:15:44.772
SoundCloud classically looks like maybe
they're doing a redesign or something so

240
00:15:44.772 --> 00:15:49.483
sometimes that's hard you're like our
customer facing site is being phased out.

241
00:15:49.483 --> 00:15:53.559
It has all these accessibility problems
but we're re-platforming don't spend time

242
00:15:53.559 --> 00:15:57.182
fixing the old thing, it's like well,
but it's not going to be usable until

243
00:15:57.182 --> 00:15:59.609
you re-platform, so
whether you get time to fix.

244
00:15:59.609 --> 00:16:03.366
Fix it or not is unclear, it'll depend.

245
00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:08.254
But if you can fix it with one
little tweak of a hex color value or

246
00:16:08.254 --> 00:16:11.826
something, maybe you
can slide it in there.

247
00:16:11.826 --> 00:16:15.092
So that's the Chrome tool,
when it works, it's great.

248
00:16:15.092 --> 00:16:18.097
It doesn't always work, so
I'm gonna show you the one in Firefox.

249
00:16:18.097 --> 00:16:21.643
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Would it
really look like triple A?

250
00:16:21.643 --> 00:16:22.355
&gt;&gt; Marcy: Good question.

251
00:16:22.355 --> 00:16:29.086
So for triple A,
that might be harder to get away with.

252
00:16:29.086 --> 00:16:29.831
I love these lines.

253
00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:34.633
So the lines,
the 4.5 is this lower line, and

254
00:16:34.633 --> 00:16:40.254
then if I drag it all the way
over to 7 to meet the 7 ratio,

255
00:16:40.254 --> 00:16:42.971
it's pretty noticeable.

256
00:16:42.971 --> 00:16:45.627
It's like a washed out orange-white, so

257
00:16:45.627 --> 00:16:50.148
I don't think I could get away with
that [LAUGH] without people noticing.

258
00:16:50.148 --> 00:16:53.886
I shipped a feature doing
exactly this last week,

259
00:16:53.886 --> 00:16:58.249
where I tweaked the colors just enough,
nobody noticed.

260
00:16:58.249 --> 00:17:00.180
So, sometimes that is the way to go.

261
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.082
And tools like this, I mean,
I think on the thing I was working on,

262
00:17:04.082 --> 00:17:06.384
this color picker was not working, and

263
00:17:06.384 --> 00:17:09.822
I sure missed it because it's
very helpful when it works.

264
00:17:09.822 --> 00:17:14.412
Otherwise, you're changing the color
slightly in the direction you want on

265
00:17:14.412 --> 00:17:18.223
the regular, like this color picker,
without the ratio line,

266
00:17:18.223 --> 00:17:21.909
and then you have to go test
the value manually, and it sucks.

267
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:26.457
[LAUGH] So let's go over to Firefox,

268
00:17:26.457 --> 00:17:31.967
because,
&gt;&gt; Marcy: We'll

269
00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:33.562
go see what's going on with the color.

270
00:17:33.562 --> 00:17:36.109
So they have the same orange.

271
00:17:36.109 --> 00:17:37.798
I don't really wanna sign in, but

272
00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:40.426
hopefully I can test this
color just in the DevTools.

273
00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:43.421
So I'm gonna inspect just
like I did in Chrome.

274
00:17:43.421 --> 00:17:47.254
And we've got the orange color,
some rotating animation,

275
00:17:47.254 --> 00:17:52.382
that is a little distracting, that is
something we're gonna talk about later.

276
00:17:52.382 --> 00:17:57.605
So, I mentioned motion,
here's an example right here.

277
00:17:57.605 --> 00:18:00.755
So this color, there's a border color and
a background color.

278
00:18:00.755 --> 00:18:05.429
So if I click on the white, it is
showing me that the contrast ratio for

279
00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:07.860
these buttons has an issue as well.

280
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.783
So if I click on this, so
it doesn't give me the line but

281
00:18:12.783 --> 00:18:19.007
it does give me the like,,
I can drag it around and change the color.

282
00:18:19.007 --> 00:18:23.064
When it's the background color
that is the thing I would change,

283
00:18:23.064 --> 00:18:25.495
I might need to use other tools to do it,

284
00:18:25.495 --> 00:18:29.955
cuz it only gives me the ability to
drag around on the foreground color.

285
00:18:29.955 --> 00:18:34.344
But if you made the change for
the text on the other examples,

286
00:18:34.344 --> 00:18:39.784
maybe that same orange color would be
the fix here too for the backgrounds.

287
00:18:39.784 --> 00:18:42.980
But this tool,
like if the Chrome one isn't working,

288
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.420
Firefox sometimes can help a little bit.

289
00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:50.385
Cuz at least the goal would be to
give you a color picker that you

290
00:18:50.385 --> 00:18:54.219
can drag around on,
cuz it's pretty helpful.

291
00:18:55.285 --> 00:19:00.945
&gt;&gt; Marcy: The accessibility inspector
in Firefox also, it has its own tab,

292
00:19:00.945 --> 00:19:05.203
and this is their
accessibility tree inspector.

293
00:19:05.203 --> 00:19:09.870
So it's similar, not exactly the same
as Chrome, but it still gives you

294
00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.325
a lot of really great information
if you're a regular Firefox user.

295
00:19:14.325 --> 00:19:16.864
And you could use X in Firefox as well.

296
00:19:19.253 --> 00:19:24.201
&gt;&gt; Marcy: Cool, okay, so
our other techniques,

297
00:19:24.201 --> 00:19:28.429
let's do a little bit of zooming.

298
00:19:28.429 --> 00:19:32.910
So I'm gonna close out my developer tools,
and

299
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:39.646
if I zoom way in to at least 200%,
I get some horizontal scrolling.

300
00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:41.902
That's not great.

301
00:19:41.902 --> 00:19:47.272
So, yeah, it looks like
the whole thing has that issue.

302
00:19:47.272 --> 00:19:51.357
So going past 200% can
be sort of ambitious.

303
00:19:51.357 --> 00:19:58.392
I think the requirement is 200%, there's
a WCAG guideline for what's called reflow.

304
00:19:58.392 --> 00:20:02.059
And so this one would fail reflow,
I would say,

305
00:20:02.059 --> 00:20:08.112
because it doesn't seem like it would
be that challenging to make this scale,

306
00:20:08.112 --> 00:20:13.816
like everything should just be responsive,
I don't know why it's not.

307
00:20:13.816 --> 00:20:15.748
But that's how I would test that one.

308
00:20:15.748 --> 00:20:19.570
I'm actually surprised that there was
an issue with that cuz that one's like,

309
00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:22.210
if it's responsive,
usually that's just handled.

310
00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.764
You might find some anomalies
that are little details, but

311
00:20:25.764 --> 00:20:29.544
that looked kind of major for
how their style sheets are set up.

312
00:20:29.544 --> 00:20:34.535
And with CSS Grid and Flexbox now,
you can just use modern tools and

313
00:20:34.535 --> 00:20:37.313
have it apply for those situations.

314
00:20:37.313 --> 00:20:38.374
It's awesome.
