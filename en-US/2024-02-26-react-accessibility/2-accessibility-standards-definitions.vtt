1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
So some standards and definitions
before we dive into screen readers.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.590
Accessibility isn't just a feeling,
there are standards and

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.305
guidelines that we can benefit from.

4
00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:13.916
And they're really a starting point, but

5
00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:17.333
they are very important in
the world of accessibility.

6
00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:22.372
Starting with WCAG, or
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

7
00:00:22.372 --> 00:00:27.744
They are a standard set of criteria for
measuring accessibility.

8
00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:32.185
Some of these rules can be automated,
which we'll see today, but

9
00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.574
a lot of them require human review.

10
00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:38.106
So, the current version of WCAG is 2.2,

11
00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:43.069
there is a looming version 3.0
out there that aims to kind of

12
00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:47.468
revolutionize how WCAG is structured,
how it works.

13
00:00:47.468 --> 00:00:51.371
It is very like far out on
the horizon I would say.

14
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:54.852
There isn't a lot of consensus among
people that it's like anywhere near ready.

15
00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:56.756
So focus on 2.2.

16
00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.445
[LAUGH] And

17
00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:02.532
I think the most important aspect of
Devas is the color contrast part.

18
00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:07.599
I think people are very excited about a
new algorithm for color contrast testing,

19
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.096
but we're still on 2.2, so
that's the standard you should aim for.

20
00:01:12.096 --> 00:01:15.295
And it's backwards compatible,
for the most part.

21
00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:20.114
One really cool thing about WCAG is that
it's developed in the open on GitHub.

22
00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:24.008
So you can go and read how people
are making decisions about it.

23
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.008
What research has gone into it,
you could go and

24
00:01:27.008 --> 00:01:30.383
ask a question if you didn't
understand something or

25
00:01:30.383 --> 00:01:34.667
I mean it just to have it developed
in the open is really incredible.

26
00:01:34.667 --> 00:01:37.618
And so
that's a resource that I reference quite

27
00:01:37.618 --> 00:01:41.244
often when I'm trying to
understand a certain criteria.

28
00:01:42.774 --> 00:01:48.024
So another acronym, this one we will
cover much more fully today, is ARIA.

29
00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:51.668
It stands for
Accessible Rich Internet Applications.

30
00:01:51.668 --> 00:01:57.024
And this is a specification that includes
a standard set of roles, states,

31
00:01:57.024 --> 00:02:02.566
and properties that PLUM accessibility
information through your web pages.

32
00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:07.232
So these are actual attributes that
you would put into your markup.

33
00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:10.190
It's a bit more of an advanced tool,
I would say.

34
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.746
So it's not the first thing you
should reach for, but there

35
00:02:13.746 --> 00:02:18.378
are some concepts that do apply to base
HTML that we will definitely get into.

36
00:02:18.378 --> 00:02:21.762
[LAUGH] The current
version of ARIA is 1.2 and

37
00:02:21.762 --> 00:02:24.895
it is also developed
in the open on GitHub.

38
00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:30.803
So this one I would definitely say I have
opened in a tab quite often to go and

39
00:02:30.803 --> 00:02:35.016
read up on what's going on
with this one attribute?

40
00:02:35.016 --> 00:02:38.363
You might even be able to
learn about browser support or

41
00:02:38.363 --> 00:02:41.580
assistive technology support for
a certain thing.

42
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.107
Yeah, it's really,
really cool to be on GitHub.

43
00:02:46.107 --> 00:02:51.829
There are other similar documents from
the W3C who puts out ARIA and WCAG.

44
00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.199
There's one called ARIA and HTML and

45
00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.645
another one called using
ARIA that are pretty great.

46
00:02:57.645 --> 00:03:00.709
These are more informational
documents where

47
00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.351
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
is what we call normative.

48
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:08.829
That means that it's clear requirements.

49
00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:13.844
Whereas some things that are non-normative
mean that they're informational

50
00:03:13.844 --> 00:03:19.096
like tutorials, that's not something that
you would point to in a court setting.

51
00:03:19.096 --> 00:03:23.865
Whereas WCAG which is codified
into a lot of laws, is normative.

52
00:03:23.865 --> 00:03:30.439
It is something that is legally required
when you're in that type of environment.

53
00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:34.731
So these terms and these standards,
when I got into accessibility,

54
00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:36.365
they were all Greek to me.

55
00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:41.324
I just didn't understand what
the point was, what these were so and

56
00:03:41.324 --> 00:03:46.457
I just want to expose you to them if
they're new, and just let them kind

57
00:03:46.457 --> 00:03:52.204
of soak in, but it's not stuff you
necessarily need to understand right now.

58
00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:54.435
Just know that these things exist.

59
00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:57.255
You can always reference this
information later as well.

60
00:03:57.255 --> 00:03:58.826
We do have one more bullet point here.

61
00:03:58.826 --> 00:04:05.559
It's a bit of a just a fun tip
is that A11Y is a numeronym.

62
00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:10.714
It is a word where you take the letters in
the middle and replace them with numbers.

63
00:04:10.714 --> 00:04:16.395
So A11Y,
there are 11 letters between A and Y.

64
00:04:16.395 --> 00:04:20.119
There's another numeronym,
internationalization, or

65
00:04:20.119 --> 00:04:24.737
IATN there's a number of those ironically,
people in accessibility and

66
00:04:24.737 --> 00:04:28.621
outside of it don't think that
it's a very accessible term.

67
00:04:28.621 --> 00:04:32.158
But it's something that
we use nonetheless,

68
00:04:32.158 --> 00:04:35.158
especially in Twitter historically.

69
00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:38.922
I mean, if you have to type it a lot and
you're short on characters,

70
00:04:38.922 --> 00:04:40.714
it's pretty easy to reach for.

71
00:04:40.714 --> 00:04:45.914
I mostly mention it just so that you know
what it is, you know what it stands for.

72
00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:47.083
You don't have to use it.

73
00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:51.252
Yeah, kind of some fun
accessibility trivia.
