>> Welcome, today we're here to talk about accessibility. I'm Marcy Sutton Todd, and I am so excited to share what I know about web accessibility with you. We have a GitHub, I shared it in the chat, it is on Marcy Sutton as my GitHub account and the frontend-masters-web-accessibility-v3 repository.

[00:00:21]
This course is going to be a little bit technical. As a front-end developer, you sort of can't get away from the technical side of accessibility. But feel free to stop me at any time or ask questions, so that we can unpack things that maybe you're needing a little bit of extra help on.

[00:00:43]
So our repo and our project is built with Next.js, so we're going to look at react quite a bit today, but anything that we do with react will apply to web-accessibility in general. What we wanna focus on, at the end of everything is what is rendered in a browser.

[00:01:00]
What is a user going to experience? So keep that in mind, kinda regardless of the framework, the technology, we're really focused on that end user experience. Okay, so a quick spin through our GitHub. You can clone this, you can also just follow along if you want to observe what we're doing.

[00:01:19]
I'll explain everything, we'll go through all the examples but you can clone this repository. And then there are some set instructions in here on how to get this running on your machine. There's also a link over here on the side. You can open up the fully built version of this, including the examples in their more working states.

[00:01:43]
I wouldn't say they're perfectly final, because accessibility is always a work in progress. But there are more complete examples that I'll show you in a minute. So I've got this already pulled down. I used VS Code as my text editor. So let's take a little bit of a tour through here to get started.

[00:02:04]
I've got the README open right now, but over here in my file explorer, we've got pages, which is how the course materials are broken up. A lot of our attention will be spent in the components directory. So this has a series of UI components that have accessibility issues built into them.

[00:02:25]
And as we go through the topics, we will work on those. And the more finished versions are in the completed components directory. So you can always look ahead, you can compare, do a diff between what we had and what we're working on. And so that's kind of the structure of how our exercises are split up.

[00:02:46]
I wanted to tell a quick story about how I got into accessibility because we're recording this course here in Minneapolis. You're probably watching it from wherever you are in the world, but I got into accessibility kind of because of Minneapolis. Target is here, big retailer in the United States, and I worked at an agency that had target as a client.

[00:03:10]
As a front-end developer, I was assigned to work on that client, on all those projects. I didn't know anything about accessibility, nothing. I had made all of the common faux pas, the code I wrote was a lot of action script before that, so I didn't know anything about accessibility.

[00:03:27]
But I learned that I really cared about it. Like, the more I learned about accessibility and how I could work it into my front-end code and design and all the things we'll learn about today, I really started to care about it. And once I met people with disabilities who would benefit from the work that we could do together on Web Accessibility.

[00:03:49]
It just clicked for me as something that I've never been able to turn off in my mind. I'm always asking about it in people's code reviews and design reviews and all of that. And that's my hope for you, is that it will click and be inviting, because we don't know everything.

[00:04:05]
I can't even possibly cover everything today. But I can share with you a process of learning and understanding of accessibility, where to go to learn more. And some of the basic things that we really should know as professional front-end developers, so that's my goal for today,
>> Someone was saying, I'm a UI developer where accessibility plays an important role, but I'm learning things like 3D web and data visualization.

[00:04:34]
I'm wondering how accessibility will look like in those type of areas.
>> Great question. So depending on what you're creating, you may or may not be able to build in a lot of accessibility. If you're doing a lot of 3D rendering with Webgl or something, Motion sensitivity might be a factor and that's a topic that we'll cover later on in our nmvisual consideration section.

[00:05:02]
I'm gonna go to our overview page, we are gonna get into some of those things. But in terms of user interface accessibility, there has to be something on the end user experience that has that requirement of if a mouse user can do something. A keyboard user has to be able to do the same thing.

[00:05:23]
And if you're doing a data visualisation, there are unique accessibility aspects to that. So I think depending on kind of what you're building, where it falls in the tech stack. If a user is experiencing this thing, if they could see it, if they're aside a person, there's likely to be some concerns.

[00:05:44]
It's such a broad question, though, that it's kind of hard to cover it all. [LAUGH] But hopefully that leads you down a path of just being curious. That's my goal for you is just to be curious about it. How would it apply here? And some of my earliest research into accessibility was in web components and Shadowdom when those first came out.

[00:06:05]
And my biggest question was, what do I need to think about for accessibility with this? And that took me down a path of research and experimentation. I ended up doing some conference talks at the end of that. Don't necessarily [LAUGH] recommend that part. But the research part and the investigation, the testing, what does it do in a screen reader?

[00:06:30]
Fire it up and find out. Make some improvements. And we'll cover the tips and techniques that you'll need to get into that today. All right, so we've got a lot to cover today as I mentioned, there's no way we could possibly cover it all. I'm one person, so this is what I thought should be included in this course.

[00:06:51]
We'll cover some of the foundational information that you should know about accessibility so that we set the scene about what's really the most important thing here. We'll talk about some standards and some definitions, I get questions about that a lot. My own coworkers, when I presented on accessibility to them, they are very smart people.

[00:07:14]
And they had questions immediately about which standards do we need to adhere to. What are the guidelines? So we'll cover some of that. But we wanna go beyond standards and guidelines. Really, we want this to be an experience that's enjoyable. We're designing with delight, but we don't want to harm people.

[00:07:34]
So we'll go into areas of accessibility, including screen readers. We're gonna dive right into that, so that'll be fun. We'll have some accessibility debugging that I would say is probably the most common set of processes that I use when I look at any user interface. We'll look at accessible HTML, which is really the foundation of a lot of accessibility, kind of regardless of framework library tooling.

[00:08:04]
That's what will get rendered in a web experience. We'll look at ARIA, kind of demystify what is this ARIA thing that you may have heard about or seen. We'll look at keyboard focus management, which is some of my favorite parts of accessibility. I will be honest with you, I love that stuff, so we're gonna geek out pretty hard on that.

[00:08:27]
And then we'll wrap up the day with some visual considerations, because there are aspects of design that come through in Web Accessibility, like motion, that we talked about briefly. And then I'll have some resources for you at the end, where to learn more. Hopefully I get you fired up to want to learn more after this.

[00:08:47]
Cuz it's really a passion of mine that has, I've carried through my whole career. So if I could even have an inkling of that feeling for you, that would be a major success today.
