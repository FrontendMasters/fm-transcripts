1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.400
So setting the language and fixing markup.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.500
So one easy win that you can
do on a lot of web pages, and

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.090
this is something that Ax will advise you
to do, is to put a language on your pages.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.834
So if there's one overall language,
English, for example,

5
00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:23.347
we can put html Lang = en for English.

6
00:00:23.347 --> 00:00:27.657
And that will actually have a pretty
profound effect on assistive technology.

7
00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:31.265
So depending on how the content is,
what language it's in,

8
00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:36.467
the screen reader will change its
pronunciation and it's really cool.

9
00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:40.585
So for sites with multiple languages,
maybe you could change it in a template,

10
00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:43.301
depending on what language
you're rendering out.

11
00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:48.378
There is page-level versus
element-level language.

12
00:00:48.378 --> 00:00:51.613
So if you have a site that's
mostly in English, but

13
00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:56.503
you have some elements on it that are in
French or some other language, you can

14
00:00:56.503 --> 00:01:01.338
actually kind of override the page-level
language on a per element basis.

15
00:01:01.338 --> 00:01:08.497
So if I have a paragraph with
Lang = fr within a Lang = en,

16
00:01:08.497 --> 00:01:13.578
that one paragraph will sound [FOREIGN].

17
00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:17.580
[LAUGH] It will sound different, and
you can hear it in the screen reader.

18
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.150
It's pretty awesome.

19
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.958
So if you had a whole page of French and
it was marked up as Lang = en,

20
00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:25.963
it would be excruciating
[LAUGH] to try and listen to.

21
00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:28.679
It would be the worst pronunciation ever.

22
00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:32.276
But actually, the screen reader can
do a way better job if you tell it

23
00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:33.993
what language it needs to be in.

24
00:01:36.093 --> 00:01:38.273
I think we even have an example.

25
00:01:38.273 --> 00:01:44.066
So I have a stack blitz here in the
project that we can actually fire up and

26
00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:44.656
test.

27
00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:46.576
So let's try that real quick.

28
00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:49.846
I am going to put it on preview mode.

29
00:01:51.156 --> 00:01:54.926
So StackBlitz itself is
probably not that accessible.

30
00:01:54.926 --> 00:01:58.317
A lot of these tools,
I want them to be more accessible.

31
00:01:58.317 --> 00:02:03.014
But often when you're testing, if you can
open the little demo project in a new

32
00:02:03.014 --> 00:02:07.712
window, sometimes that'll isolate it so
that the screen reader doesn't get

33
00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:10.813
tripped up on other UI
elements of the tool itself.

34
00:02:10.813 --> 00:02:16.238
So I'm gonna turn on voiceover
with function command F5.

35
00:02:16.238 --> 00:02:19.787
&gt;&gt; Navigation, visited link,
heading level one,

36
00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:24.020
web accessibility,
v3 home frame preview page, group.

37
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.723
&gt;&gt; So you can get into it.

38
00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:28.083
&gt;&gt; You are currently on a frame
to an https://webdashflat.

39
00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:33.965
https://web-dashplatform-li6gwd, heading
level 2, Boef Bourgignon,

40
00:02:33.965 --> 00:02:39.195
heading level 1, French Recipes,
heading level 2, Boef Bourgignon.

41
00:02:39.195 --> 00:02:40.513
You are currently on the heading
level 2 [CROSSTALK].

42
00:02:40.513 --> 00:02:43.114
&gt;&gt; That didn't work did it [LAUGH]?

43
00:02:43.114 --> 00:02:46.983
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN] So that's what it
sounds like when it doesn't work.

44
00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:52.711
[LAUGH] That was so
terrible, jet hub anyone?

45
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:53.511
&gt;&gt; VoiceOver off.

46
00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:54.931
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that didn't work at all.

47
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:56.121
So that could be Chrome.

48
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:01.529
It totally worked when I tested it,
so it does have the Lang fr,

49
00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.173
that could be reason enough
to open this up in Safari.

50
00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:10.817
So because I am committed to this
I'm going to go open it up and see.

51
00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:17.552
We'll see maybe our first difference,
if StackBlitz will load.

52
00:03:17.552 --> 00:03:21.532
It will, okay, so I'm gonna fire
it up again, function command F5.

53
00:03:21.532 --> 00:03:25.147
&gt;&gt; Voiceover on Safari, set recipes,
you are current, heading level 1,

54
00:03:25.147 --> 00:03:27.142
heading level 2, Boeuf Bourguignon.

55
00:03:27.142 --> 00:03:27.657
&gt;&gt; Nope.

56
00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.369
&gt;&gt; You are current,
heading level 1, French Recipes.

57
00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.891
You are heading level 2,
Boeuf Bourguignon.

58
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:33.640
&gt;&gt; That's so terrible.

59
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.302
&gt;&gt; You are currently on the heading
level 2 inside of the frame.

60
00:03:36.302 --> 00:03:39.158
Character palette, close button Safari,
setting a language and

61
00:03:39.158 --> 00:03:40.901
fixed voice over off.

62
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.601
&gt;&gt; Sad face emoji.

63
00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:46.849
Well, the demo gods were not blessing
us [LAUGH] in this example and

64
00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.901
I have no idea why,
maybe it's something with StackBlitz.

65
00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:56.018
I think when I tested it, it was not
embedded within the slide window itself,

66
00:03:56.018 --> 00:04:00.820
so we have to test stuff periodically,
and I swear Voiceover will do that

67
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.330
sometimes where you're, wait,
that worked and then it didn't.

68
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.042
But we're embedding
windows within windows so

69
00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:14.822
all bets are off if it'll be beef
bojignon or boeuf bourguignon.

70
00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:20.236
That's pretty funny, [LAUGH] At least
you can see the kind of what happens

71
00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:25.399
when you don't have the attribute so
it's informative in that way.

72
00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.019
Fun [LAUGH], okay, well,
I'm going to close out of Safari.

73
00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:34.039
That was a fun little experiment.

74
00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:37.705
&gt;&gt; I often find engineers use the button
tag for a link usually because they need

75
00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:40.175
an on click handler for
something like analytics.

76
00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:47.352
For example, pushing to the route
in a function when the next router,

77
00:04:47.352 --> 00:04:49.686
instead of using an actual link.

78
00:04:49.686 --> 00:04:53.784
What would be the best way to correctly
handle this so that a link is a link, but

79
00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:55.210
it also calls a function?

80
00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.782
&gt;&gt; Well, I think, yeah,
it's gonna depend on your router, for one.

81
00:05:01.782 --> 00:05:06.195
I haven't had to use a router
in a little while, and

82
00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:10.732
you'll learn why,
[LAUGH] this week for sure.

83
00:05:10.732 --> 00:05:11.902
But I think if,

84
00:05:11.902 --> 00:05:18.066
I've seen a lot of buttons that should be
links in the code base I'm working on.

85
00:05:18.066 --> 00:05:22.084
And I think sometimes
styles are the constraint.

86
00:05:22.084 --> 00:05:26.105
If you're dealing with old styles
that everyone's afraid to touch,

87
00:05:26.105 --> 00:05:28.636
that can be a reason
why the stuff persists.

88
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:35.196
So to try and solve that,
yeah, I guess I'd have to see,

89
00:05:35.196 --> 00:05:43.823
can you put maybe an event listener on
the element and the h or f for the link.

90
00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:48.042
That's just kind of talking you through
my process of what I would try,

91
00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:52.542
is to see if you can register a click
event that doesn't do any navigating but

92
00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:57.633
will kind of capture that analytics event,
especially if it's client side routed.

93
00:05:57.633 --> 00:06:00.870
I guess one thing I
would be looking out for

94
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.386
is if the default html
navigation with href,

95
00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:09.568
if it wasn't client-side routed,
it would probably refresh and

96
00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:15.185
you may or may not see that click
event to capture that analytics event.

97
00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:19.053
But if it is client-side routed,
it's not gonna refresh the page.

98
00:06:19.053 --> 00:06:23.796
So theoretically, maybe you could
do a click event and an href, but

99
00:06:23.796 --> 00:06:26.833
I'm not totally certain that would work.

100
00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:31.993
That's kinda just my thought process,
cuz often there are constraints like that,

101
00:06:31.993 --> 00:06:34.983
and we're like,
why does this happen this way?

102
00:06:36.153 --> 00:06:37.973
It's not by choice.

103
00:06:37.973 --> 00:06:41.556
It's just because of whatever we're
trying to navigate through at work.

104
00:06:42.976 --> 00:06:47.153
So I think in an ideal world, we do want
to try and make links look like links and

105
00:06:47.153 --> 00:06:48.890
buttons look like buttons, but

106
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.648
I can say from experience that
that's just not always what happens.
