1
00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:02.245
Okay, so working with teams.

2
00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:05.713
It's one thing if you're working
by yourself on a project,

3
00:00:05.713 --> 00:00:10.204
your commit messages and things don't
have to be [LAUGH] that useful for teams.

4
00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:11.843
And you can make all
the decisions you want.

5
00:00:11.843 --> 00:00:14.077
But when you're working with other people,

6
00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:18.208
there's some things you might wanna be
aware of with team concerns and processes.

7
00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:22.565
So I have some ideas around
how to make this a team sport.

8
00:00:22.565 --> 00:00:26.636
Because that's how we're gonna make
the biggest impact is if as many of us

9
00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:28.289
are chipping in as possible.

10
00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.854
So sort of the reality of some
of the accessibility efforts

11
00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:35.215
that we put in are that we
have to have accountability.

12
00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:38.156
We have to actually make
it a requirement and

13
00:00:38.156 --> 00:00:40.784
make it part of the definition of done.

14
00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:47.061
And so you have to kind of get your
leadership team on board if you can,

15
00:00:47.061 --> 00:00:51.190
so that you have time to
actually spend on it.

16
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.750
I mean, this is gonna be
a negotiation in some cases where

17
00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.599
it might have to get worked on
after a breaking change ships.

18
00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:03.245
You might need to decouple fixes.

19
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:07.089
I had this come up the other day where I
really wanted to rip out a component that

20
00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:08.401
was super inaccessible.

21
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:13.522
But there was a display bug that
I was trying to get the time,

22
00:01:13.522 --> 00:01:15.684
the cycles to work on it.

23
00:01:15.684 --> 00:01:20.689
I was having issues and so I'm gonna
have to decouple things, fix the display

24
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.701
issue and then come back in and the next
sprint and do the accessibility work.

25
00:01:25.701 --> 00:01:29.019
So sometimes you don't get to
just rip it all out and do it.

26
00:01:29.019 --> 00:01:32.979
You have to negotiate
how to make it part of

27
00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.288
a definition of done
that people agree with.

28
00:01:37.288 --> 00:01:41.227
Yeah, it's part of the reality
of doing this stuff sometimes.

29
00:01:41.227 --> 00:01:43.332
And so part of this also is,

30
00:01:43.332 --> 00:01:48.839
who takes responsibility if something
is inaccessible gets shipped?

31
00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:53.078
We heard a story earlier about a lawsuit.

32
00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:57.663
Those are super common, and so
sometimes those happen after things have

33
00:01:57.663 --> 00:02:02.636
shipped that it's not a surprise at all
because you knew it was inaccessible.

34
00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:05.943
And you tried to do something about it,
it's like, well,

35
00:02:05.943 --> 00:02:07.806
who's held accountable for it?

36
00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:12.450
It really should be the decision makers
that said, no, we are gonna ship it.

37
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.063
I hear you,
we're not gonna tackle it this cycle.

38
00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:19.983
That person has to be held accountable.

39
00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:22.994
So these things all come up,
it's not always pretty, but

40
00:02:22.994 --> 00:02:25.403
we wanna document things
as much as possible.

41
00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:29.381
Document your findings,
find what you tested at that time,

42
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:34.218
if you have to put it down, but
you've done some of the preliminary work,

43
00:02:34.218 --> 00:02:39.463
keep your code in a branch, have some
documentation of what was the state of it.

44
00:02:39.463 --> 00:02:44.016
So that if you do have to come back to it,
at least you're not totally starting over.

45
00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:46.686
That can be helpful.

46
00:02:46.686 --> 00:02:51.155
When you're doing code reviews,
this is a really great time to try and

47
00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:56.326
get accessibility addressed in the moment,
cuz we don't wanna add to our debt.

48
00:02:56.326 --> 00:03:00.924
I just accrued some accessibility debt
at my own job this week, it happens.

49
00:03:00.924 --> 00:03:03.633
But when you're reviewing people's code,

50
00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:07.124
that might be the time for
people to make some changes, and

51
00:03:07.124 --> 00:03:11.629
hopefully, you can get stuff in at that
time and not have to come back to it.

52
00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.736
There's sort of an art to how you provide
this feedback, cuz we want people

53
00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:21.946
to want to work with us even though
we're the bearers of bad news sometimes.

54
00:03:21.946 --> 00:03:26.823
We don't wanna make people feel bad
cuz we want them to fix their stuff,

55
00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:28.545
so we have to be tactful.

56
00:03:28.545 --> 00:03:32.648
[LAUGH] But
surface it at the right time like, hey,

57
00:03:32.648 --> 00:03:35.482
we need to make this click event and

58
00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:40.479
put it on a real button so
that a keyboard user can operate it.

59
00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:44.220
That's one I see all the time,
where there's click events on divs.

60
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.311
And if they can't fix it right then,
then open up an issue

61
00:03:49.311 --> 00:03:55.265
that will get put on the backlog and
make some good trouble over it.

62
00:03:55.265 --> 00:04:00.113
We don't wanna be like, we're gonna be
squeaky wheel about it in the way that you

63
00:04:00.113 --> 00:04:03.891
can in your own work context, but
we wanna make sure that things

64
00:04:03.891 --> 00:04:07.266
don't just languish in the backlog and
never get done.

65
00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:09.837
So you have to kind of find
that right balance of,

66
00:04:09.837 --> 00:04:11.481
is this the right time to do it?

67
00:04:11.481 --> 00:04:14.705
I understand the team's
under a lot of pressure,

68
00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:18.389
how are we actually gonna make
sure that this gets fixed so

69
00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.331
it doesn't just get shipped inaccessibly
and go out like that way forever?

70
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:28.343
Code reviews, and
then use consistent tooling and processes.

71
00:04:28.343 --> 00:04:35.278
If you're all using the AX extension,
pay attention to what version it's on.

72
00:04:35.278 --> 00:04:41.071
Make sure you're all updated, or in your
issues, if you've have AX results or

73
00:04:41.071 --> 00:04:45.230
something, maybe document
what version the API was on.

74
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:49.634
That can be helpful to know so
that if something changes,

75
00:04:49.634 --> 00:04:55.246
you have a track record of how you
tested it, even just how you tested it.

76
00:04:55.246 --> 00:04:59.871
Tab into the page with a keyboard,
turn on the AX extension,

77
00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:04.136
whatever stuff steps you took
to reproduce that issue,

78
00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:07.687
put it in your issues,
in your pull requests.

79
00:05:07.687 --> 00:05:12.988
I find people are very light on
documentation [LAUGH] in PRs,

80
00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:15.752
or pull requests, or issues.

81
00:05:15.752 --> 00:05:20.511
So just sharing what steps to take to
reproduce an issue in general can be super

82
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:21.109
useful.

83
00:05:22.907 --> 00:05:26.220
And as you get into
accessibility maturity,

84
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.323
companies that are much more serious about
it and have to have more attention on it,

85
00:05:32.323 --> 00:05:37.554
there are tons of tools by all of
the major accessibility companies that

86
00:05:37.554 --> 00:05:42.556
you can sort of upscale into some of
those pages tools if you need to.

87
00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:43.954
Question?

88
00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:48.457
&gt;&gt; How much are we asked to estimate
when factoring in accessibility?

89
00:05:48.457 --> 00:05:53.066
What percentage of additional
time should we consider adding?

90
00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:54.638
&gt;&gt; Good question.

91
00:05:54.638 --> 00:06:01.438
The figure that I heard working with
a very large tech company was around 30%.

92
00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:05.330
And I think they were being kind of
generous about it just because they're

93
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.156
a big company.

94
00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:10.921
It's a slow moving ship, there's always
delays and cost overruns in general.

95
00:06:10.921 --> 00:06:15.905
So I think they were trying to be,
I don't know, sort of forgiving about it.

96
00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:20.752
But that could be on the high end like 30%
of your time throughout the whole whole

97
00:06:20.752 --> 00:06:21.396
process.

98
00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:26.390
I mean, it does cost money to do it,
to cost time and money.

99
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.278
I think as developers, there are some
easy wins that we can do that should

100
00:06:30.278 --> 00:06:32.081
just be part of our regular flow.

101
00:06:32.081 --> 00:06:37.913
And 30% of our time, that seems a little
bit high if you're doing it all the time,

102
00:06:37.913 --> 00:06:39.984
just as a matter, of course.

103
00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:42.159
But it's kind of hard to quantify.

104
00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:45.685
I will say that the cost of not
doing it would be way more.

105
00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:50.229
If you have to rebuild your whole site,
how much is that gonna cost, or

106
00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.709
the legal risk, or the lost revenue?

107
00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:58.649
So some of that padded estimates up front
could be you're trading that time for

108
00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:03.239
not having to redo everything later,
or missing out on a huge

109
00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:08.282
contract because your competitor
is accessible and you aren't.

110
00:07:08.282 --> 00:07:10.567
So kind of put it that way.

111
00:07:10.567 --> 00:07:15.913
Would you rather plan it a little bit
up front and have it go more smoothly,

112
00:07:15.913 --> 00:07:21.619
or just go cowboy style and we're just
gonna take a chance and not do anything?

113
00:07:21.619 --> 00:07:25.827
Unfortunately, I think that's
what a lot of companies do.

114
00:07:25.827 --> 00:07:30.191
But I think there's some easy wins that
we can work in even if our broader

115
00:07:30.191 --> 00:07:33.046
organizations aren't
quite up to speed yet.

116
00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:36.521
I mean, I'm the sort of just do it and
ask for forgiveness and

117
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:38.375
not permission type of person.

118
00:07:38.375 --> 00:07:43.375
But this does take time,
work is work, it does take time and

119
00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:49.186
effort, so we have to find that
balance that works best for us, yes.

120
00:07:49.186 --> 00:07:50.018
&gt;&gt; On the team,

121
00:07:50.018 --> 00:07:54.717
I built something that disabled
the cursor on localhost on Wednesdays and

122
00:07:54.717 --> 00:07:58.977
it frustrated a lot of people, but
we found and fixed a ton of bugs.

123
00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:03.269
&gt;&gt; Nice, round of applause for
that, that's amazing.

124
00:08:03.269 --> 00:08:07.417
[LAUGH] l actually have
a tool that I wrote that's

125
00:08:07.417 --> 00:08:10.743
kind of similar called No Mouse Days.

126
00:08:10.743 --> 00:08:12.370
We might have it in the slide somewhere.

127
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:17.599
But there is a tool it
basically is that same idea of

128
00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:24.083
having a package that would
automatically hide your cursor.

129
00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:28.446
This will hide it in CSS in any site
that this package is included in,

130
00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:32.442
if you configure it that way,
but yeah, it's frustrating.

131
00:08:32.442 --> 00:08:37.661
But sometimes you have to take desperate
measures to really get through,

132
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:39.946
so that's amazing, good job.

133
00:08:39.946 --> 00:08:45.082
[LAUGH] Okay, so
going beyond compliance, accessibility

134
00:08:45.082 --> 00:08:50.005
compliance, and
I have a meme from Austin Powers of Dr.

135
00:08:50.005 --> 00:08:54.540
Evil Goin,
our site is accessibility compliant.

136
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:59.804
And I can't tell you how often
I see this as a line item and

137
00:08:59.804 --> 00:09:03.836
a doc of, we aim to meet WCAG 2.2 AA, and

138
00:09:03.836 --> 00:09:09.001
then there's literally no
process to actually do it.

139
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:13.997
Click events on divs that ship and
I'm the only one in a PR review going,

140
00:09:13.997 --> 00:09:15.428
can we change that?

141
00:09:15.428 --> 00:09:21.359
You might be the only one even though
it's literally in your documentation.

142
00:09:21.359 --> 00:09:23.817
So saying something is compliant and

143
00:09:23.817 --> 00:09:28.265
actually making it accessible
are two totally different things.

144
00:09:28.265 --> 00:09:32.208
And you can say it's compliant,
but it probably isn't, for one.

145
00:09:32.208 --> 00:09:36.650
It might have been for a short period
of time before you made changes and

146
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:37.865
shipped it again.

147
00:09:37.865 --> 00:09:42.462
So if you had a big audit and it was let
done months and months ago, it's probably

148
00:09:42.462 --> 00:09:47.204
not relevant anymore if you're shipping
software regularly cuz things change.

149
00:09:47.204 --> 00:09:54.635
And so when it was tested to where it is
now, it's probably not the same at all.

150
00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:56.112
So we wanna go beyond compliance.

151
00:09:56.112 --> 00:09:57.969
We wanna make a good experience and

152
00:09:57.969 --> 00:10:00.859
it's something that we want
to work on iteratively.

153
00:10:00.859 --> 00:10:05.535
We're always like, we're improving
any kind of bugs, or any kind of

154
00:10:05.535 --> 00:10:10.786
software features, accessibility is
just part of that process all the time.

155
00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:12.613
That's how it's gonna
be the most successful.

156
00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:16.885
So I wanna kind of get past compliance,
especially when it comes to

157
00:10:16.885 --> 00:10:20.945
the web content accessibility guidelines,
which are great.

158
00:10:20.945 --> 00:10:22.538
But they're just a starting point.

159
00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:26.419
It's all about, is the experience good?

160
00:10:26.419 --> 00:10:28.609
So a better way to think about this,

161
00:10:28.609 --> 00:10:33.659
I mentioned it being a constant work in
progress and something that we iterate on.

162
00:10:33.659 --> 00:10:35.981
But it also needs to
be part of the design.

163
00:10:35.981 --> 00:10:39.173
It needs to be part of your product DNA,
and

164
00:10:39.173 --> 00:10:42.819
the earlier you incorporate that,
the better.

165
00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:46.264
Mostly cuz depending on
how your work gets done,

166
00:10:46.264 --> 00:10:50.810
design might have been way earlier and
you can't change it now.

167
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:55.426
So if we have issues with contrast or
font readability or

168
00:10:55.426 --> 00:10:59.366
things that are more
visual characteristics.

169
00:10:59.366 --> 00:11:04.301
That's stuff that,
that ship has sailed long ago, and

170
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:07.766
you can only fix so much as a developer.

171
00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:12.215
That's design debt right there,
turning into accessibility debt.

172
00:11:12.215 --> 00:11:17.561
So we wanna make changes as often and
as early as we can.

173
00:11:17.561 --> 00:11:20.713
If you can put an accessibility
statement on your website,

174
00:11:20.713 --> 00:11:22.358
that could be really helpful.

175
00:11:22.358 --> 00:11:27.648
It gives people with disabilities a way
to contact you if they do have an issue,

176
00:11:27.648 --> 00:11:30.613
and it's a really great
tool to have to say,

177
00:11:30.613 --> 00:11:34.240
hey, these are the standards
we're aiming to meet.

178
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:36.179
We're working on it.

179
00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:39.184
You don't wanna be like,
we nailed it, we're great.

180
00:11:39.184 --> 00:11:42.518
Just putting the statement here to say,
we're compliant, that's not the goal.

181
00:11:42.518 --> 00:11:45.458
The goal is to say, hey,
this is what we're trying to do,

182
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:49.299
we're continually working on this,
if you find an issue, please tell us.

183
00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:53.849
Cuz those feedback comments are gifts,
they really are helpful.

184
00:11:53.849 --> 00:11:58.117
And so you wanna give people a way to
email you or chat with you and tell you.

185
00:11:58.117 --> 00:12:00.818
Cuz they might be in
a combination of browser and

186
00:12:00.818 --> 00:12:03.733
screen reader that wasn't
at the top of your list.

187
00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:08.671
So maybe they could help you
identify a super blocking issue that

188
00:12:08.671 --> 00:12:10.874
you just weren't aware of.

189
00:12:10.874 --> 00:12:14.711
So accessibility statements
are really great for that.

190
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:19.318
And then don't stop at tooling,
just like Lighthouse and AX saying,

191
00:12:19.318 --> 00:12:22.533
okay, zero issues, 100%, you're good.

192
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:25.254
That may not be the full picture.

193
00:12:25.254 --> 00:12:29.372
There's a great article that I
linked to my slides called Building

194
00:12:29.372 --> 00:12:33.638
the Most Inaccessible Site Possible
with a Perfect Lighthouse Score

195
00:12:33.638 --> 00:12:35.125
by Manuel Matusovich.

196
00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:40.050
And he highlights perfectly this problem
that you could have a clean bill

197
00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:44.422
of health with an automated tool but
it could still be terrible.

198
00:12:44.422 --> 00:12:48.293
So there's some links in here
to read a little bit later.

199
00:12:48.293 --> 00:12:52.157
I would like to dive
into actual debugging.

200
00:12:52.157 --> 00:12:53.707
Be ready for that.
