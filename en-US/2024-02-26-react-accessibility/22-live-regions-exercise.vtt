1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.091
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So
for this exercise,

2
00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:06.800
we are going to announce when
we add things to the cart.

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.210
So when you click this button,
Add to Cart,

4
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.053
we're gonna show a little
badge up here in the cart.

5
00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:18.029
I don't wanna move the focus up
there cuz the person might be,

6
00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.157
maybe they wanna add
two things to the cart.

7
00:00:20.157 --> 00:00:21.486
Maybe they wanna do something else.

8
00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:24.926
Well, I guess that's
a design consideration of,

9
00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:27.570
should we move focus to the cart or not.

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.155
In this case, I'm gonna say we're not.

11
00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:35.103
And instead, we are going to announce
that there is a live region.

12
00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:36.395
Or using a live region,

13
00:00:36.395 --> 00:00:40.157
we are going to announce that there's
a certain number of products.

14
00:00:45.918 --> 00:00:50.646
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So for
this one, let's code it together.

15
00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:51.209
Sound good?

16
00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:52.453
And then we'll take a break.

17
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:59.386
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay, so for
this we are in the Exercise 4.

18
00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:02.495
We have similar to the last exercise.

19
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:08.259
The one we're viewing is the one that
doesn't have this supported in it yet.

20
00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:14.339
So if I click this button,
I don't see anything.

21
00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:17.079
I think my button might
not even be a real button.

22
00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.882
But what I want to have happen is there
will be a little badge that shows up.

23
00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:24.412
So we need some state that is
going to show that number.

24
00:01:24.412 --> 00:01:28.674
And then we're gonna write an ARIA
live region that will just

25
00:01:28.674 --> 00:01:31.361
announce when that text is appended.

26
00:01:31.361 --> 00:01:35.955
And we can always look at
the more completed example.

27
00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:39.723
So I'm gonna come over here to our code.

28
00:01:39.723 --> 00:01:46.435
That stuff is all, I think for
the most part in the product details.

29
00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:51.878
So our button, I was right, it is not
a real button, that was something else.

30
00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:53.785
So this is interesting.

31
00:01:53.785 --> 00:01:56.927
I don't think acts complained
about this button or

32
00:01:56.927 --> 00:02:00.224
maybe the version of that
page had real buttons in it.

33
00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:02.546
But these should be buttons, not divs.

34
00:02:02.546 --> 00:02:06.878
I don't think acts will complain at you
if you have a click event on a div,

35
00:02:06.878 --> 00:02:10.357
cuz there are valid use cases for
click events on divs, but

36
00:02:10.357 --> 00:02:12.718
it's also a big accessibility issue.

37
00:02:12.718 --> 00:02:14.606
So now this is a real button.

38
00:02:14.606 --> 00:02:20.658
It has a click event on it with
a callback function called onAddToCart.

39
00:02:20.658 --> 00:02:25.335
So this product detail page,
it knows which product we're looking at.

40
00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:30.479
So it's gonna pass its product data
object back up to the parent to say,

41
00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.851
hey, this is the one that we're
gonna pass up to the shopping

42
00:02:34.851 --> 00:02:39.165
cart cuz the shopping cart is
outside of the scope of this.

43
00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:44.953
So we have to do a little bit of
passing around of state to show that.

44
00:02:44.953 --> 00:02:49.101
And there's definitely more than
one way you could do this for

45
00:02:49.101 --> 00:02:54.227
this sort of prototyped product page,
that's how we're gonna handle it.

46
00:02:54.227 --> 00:03:02.583
So onAddToCart,
let's go trace the trail of where that is.

47
00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.935
So if I go up to the top of the page,

48
00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:08.303
product details gets
that callback function.

49
00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:14.633
So product details is added
here in the product page.

50
00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:19.523
So that's where this onAddCart callback
function, then on the parent side,

51
00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:22.202
I can handle what's in the shopping cart.

52
00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:27.276
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So we have state
tracking the shopping cart items.

53
00:03:27.276 --> 00:03:33.214
We have that callback function that will
say, all right, go add this to our cart.

54
00:03:33.214 --> 00:03:35.656
And I don't think it's actually
doing anything right now.

55
00:03:35.656 --> 00:03:42.415
So what I'm gonna do is make another
function call onAddToCart and

56
00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:47.129
I'm gonna update the state
in that function.

57
00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.634
Let's call it onAddToCart.

58
00:03:52.634 --> 00:03:59.666
It's gonna take in a product
that is going to want a type.

59
00:04:03.582 --> 00:04:07.181
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're missing
the right arrow function.

60
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.955
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Yeah, thank you.

61
00:04:11.363 --> 00:04:16.539
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay, so in here,
we're gonna say UpdateShoppingCartItems.

62
00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.945
I am going to combine.

63
00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:22.996
What was potentially in
the shopping cart already,

64
00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:27.636
like if I was on another product page or
something, I have to, yeah, I'm not,

65
00:04:27.636 --> 00:04:30.715
this is definitely not
a data architecture course.

66
00:04:30.715 --> 00:04:34.206
[LAUGH] So
this is what we're doing right now.

67
00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:38.763
Okay, we'll say items.

68
00:04:38.763 --> 00:04:42.296
Let's say shoppingCartItems and
the new product.

69
00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:45.809
We're gonna combine those
using the spread operator, and

70
00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:50.456
then we will update our shopping cart
state with that combined array of items.

71
00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.013
So there's an array of objects here.

72
00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:56.783
So onAddToCart now has
updated those items.

73
00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.397
Do that stuff, so

74
00:04:59.397 --> 00:05:04.680
the shoppingCartItems are actually already
being passed in to our ProductHeader.

75
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.360
We just weren't really doing
anything to update it.

76
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.780
So I'm gonna save that.

77
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.979
Let's go over to the ProductHeader.

78
00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.284
And our Shopping Cart icon,

79
00:05:15.284 --> 00:05:21.351
I'm going to maybe collapse
our Banner component.

80
00:05:21.351 --> 00:05:22.957
So here's our shopping cart.

81
00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:27.698
So I've got shoppingCartItems,

82
00:05:27.698 --> 00:05:32.439
so if I have shoppingCartItems and

83
00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:37.996
just to be extra careful, I'm gonna say

84
00:05:37.996 --> 00:05:43.064
if the length is more than 0, then,

85
00:05:43.064 --> 00:05:47.979
I could output a little badge icon.

86
00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.235
So,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I think I already

87
00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:54.232
have the CSS for that.

88
00:05:54.232 --> 00:05:59.092
And that will be our little
circle with the number up there.

89
00:05:59.092 --> 00:06:03.578
So just to make sure that I
have the CSS for that in here,

90
00:06:03.578 --> 00:06:07.689
we have a CSS class,
I'm just gonna go and check.

91
00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:11.890
I always confuse these two,
okay, custom.css.

92
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.675
Okay, so we have a badge here,
it's got a red background-color.

93
00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:18.065
It's like a little circle
with some text in it.

94
00:06:18.065 --> 00:06:20.183
So that's in there.

95
00:06:20.183 --> 00:06:24.400
I did bail out of tailwind for this
example cuz it was not working for me for

96
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.243
some reason.

97
00:06:27.103 --> 00:06:29.563
So we're getting the job
done with CSS classes.

98
00:06:29.563 --> 00:06:35.816
So we've got a little badge that will
output if there's more than zero items.

99
00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:39.703
It's like that message notification
that won't ever go away otherwise, so

100
00:06:39.703 --> 00:06:42.714
we only wanna show it if there's
actually something in it.

101
00:06:42.714 --> 00:06:47.798
So then we need to say,
shoppingCartItems.length,

102
00:06:47.798 --> 00:06:50.565
that will show us the number.

103
00:06:50.565 --> 00:06:58.073
And for our live region, we want to say,
hey, there's items in there.

104
00:06:58.073 --> 00:07:00.881
Put our live region right
up here in the header.

105
00:07:00.881 --> 00:07:04.663
If you had live regions throughout your
product or throughout your web app,

106
00:07:04.663 --> 00:07:06.805
you might wanna centralize them somehow.

107
00:07:06.805 --> 00:07:09.475
But for this kind of first iteration,

108
00:07:09.475 --> 00:07:14.407
I'm just gonna create it right here
in the element, or in the header.

109
00:07:14.407 --> 00:07:16.532
So I'm gonna make this a div.

110
00:07:16.532 --> 00:07:19.116
I'm gonna say div role=status.

111
00:07:19.116 --> 00:07:22.262
That will create our live region.

112
00:07:22.262 --> 00:07:27.359
I am going to make it visually hidden
with the tailwind sr=only class.

113
00:07:28.799 --> 00:07:35.543
And we could just say
shoppingCartItems.length,

114
00:07:35.543 --> 00:07:42.446
like there are a certain
number of items in your cart.

115
00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:50.436
So I could say,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Let's see.

116
00:07:50.436 --> 00:07:55.790
I actually wanna abstract this into

117
00:07:55.790 --> 00:08:01.506
a state variable, so I'm gonna say.

118
00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:05.930
Let's see, regionAnnouncement or
cartAnnouncement,

119
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:10.723
I think that's what I called it,
cartAnnouncementMessage.

120
00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:16.000
So I'm gonna go to find that
up here using React state,

121
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.137
I could say, cartAnnouncementMessage
setCartAnnouncementMessage.

122
00:08:23.137 --> 00:08:30.092
And I'll say = useState,
that will be a string.

123
00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.530
And I'll start it off as an empty string.

124
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:36.161
So the element will be there, but
it won't have any content in it, so

125
00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:37.673
nothing will be read aloud.

126
00:08:37.673 --> 00:08:42.470
And then when we get shopping cart
items I can do things like manipulate

127
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:44.350
what that text looks like.

128
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.574
I can say, does it have item or
items in it?

129
00:08:47.574 --> 00:08:49.936
I could have done that in line in the JSX,

130
00:08:49.936 --> 00:08:54.051
it just felt like a little too much
logic to put down there in my markup.

131
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:57.068
So I'm gonna do, I guess,
pick your poison, right?

132
00:08:57.068 --> 00:08:59.138
I'm gonna do useEffect instead.

133
00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:02.613
So when we get that card
announcement message, or

134
00:09:02.613 --> 00:09:07.164
sorry the shopping cart items,
I'm gonna create a side effect of

135
00:09:07.164 --> 00:09:10.574
generating a live region
announcement from it.

136
00:09:10.574 --> 00:09:15.631
So in my dependency array,
I'm gonna say shoppingCartItems,

137
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:20.220
so this way I can safely manipulate,
I can take that data,

138
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:26.888
manipulate it into the string I want, and
I can call setCardAnnouncementMessage.

139
00:09:26.888 --> 00:09:31.122
It will then create this other
state variable that I need to use.

140
00:09:31.122 --> 00:09:35.582
So let's say, so item or items, my gosh,

141
00:09:35.582 --> 00:09:39.942
naming things is always the hardest,
right?

142
00:09:39.942 --> 00:09:44.190
So,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So

143
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:48.772
if shoppingCartItems.length, if it === 1,

144
00:09:48.772 --> 00:09:55.278
I could say you have one item in your
cart, otherwise, it'll be items.

145
00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:57.554
If it's zero items,
we aren't going to see it.

146
00:09:57.554 --> 00:10:02.097
But if it's two or more, we'll see items.

147
00:10:02.097 --> 00:10:07.028
So then,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Get my ternary

148
00:10:07.028 --> 00:10:07.949
operator here.

149
00:10:07.949 --> 00:10:13.845
So I could say setCartAnnouncementMessage,

150
00:10:13.845 --> 00:10:20.644
I'm gonna make a template literal and
say there are,

151
00:10:20.644 --> 00:10:26.896
shoppingCartItems.length,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: And

152
00:10:26.896 --> 00:10:32.474
then our item or items in your cart.

153
00:10:32.474 --> 00:10:36.530
So that should be there
are the number of items in your cart.

154
00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:43.025
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I could wrap this in
logic if I really wanted to be extra safe

155
00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:48.364
by saying, if shoppingCartItems,
probably don't need to do that.

156
00:10:48.364 --> 00:10:54.865
But if the length is greater than 0,
then run this code.

157
00:10:54.865 --> 00:10:59.795
I don't think it'll matter, but
if you want to be extra type safe or

158
00:10:59.795 --> 00:11:02.921
something, that should give us a string.

159
00:11:02.921 --> 00:11:05.301
Let's go see what happened.

160
00:11:06.638 --> 00:11:09.112
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So,
we will add to the cart,

161
00:11:09.112 --> 00:11:14.490
shopping cart items is not iterable,
I saw this before.

162
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.710
So I think my type script any,
there it is,

163
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:24.216
so this actually should be product.

164
00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:31.125
That's a type that this file doesn't know
about, so I'm going to go import the type.

165
00:11:33.021 --> 00:11:38.495
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Product from,
where are those types?

166
00:11:38.495 --> 00:11:44.202
Types, okay, seems to be cool with that.

167
00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:49.158
Okay, so now it should be an iterable,

168
00:11:49.158 --> 00:11:55.780
I thought it would be before but
it was mad, big mad.

169
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:02.053
Still not, okay, so for
time purposes, yes.

170
00:12:02.053 --> 00:12:02.972
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was gonna say,

171
00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:07.054
I think I know the problem like further
upstream in the parent component.

172
00:12:07.054 --> 00:12:07.614
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Mm-hm.

173
00:12:07.614 --> 00:12:09.895
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think the state
was initialized as null.

174
00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:10.932
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay.

175
00:12:10.932 --> 00:12:14.415
Yes, it was.

176
00:12:14.415 --> 00:12:16.288
And it's in here too.

177
00:12:16.288 --> 00:12:20.982
So product,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Yeah,

178
00:12:20.982 --> 00:12:26.068
it's an array of products and
I can initialize it as an empty array.

179
00:12:26.068 --> 00:12:27.045
Thank you.

180
00:12:30.913 --> 00:12:32.219
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Save
us a little bit of time.

181
00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:33.805
Now it is mad.

182
00:12:33.805 --> 00:12:43.186
If shoppingCartItems,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: And.

183
00:12:43.186 --> 00:12:47.999
It's interesting that it complained
in the browser but not in line.

184
00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:53.735
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay,
let's see if that worked.

185
00:12:53.735 --> 00:12:56.570
No, okay, fun.

186
00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:00.710
It's only mad when I click that button, so

187
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:05.086
I'm gonna open the full
page in another tab.

188
00:13:06.817 --> 00:13:07.888
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: That one worked.

189
00:13:07.888 --> 00:13:09.422
Okay, so we have the badge there.

190
00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:12.302
I'm not really sure what's going on,
but we'll figure it out.

191
00:13:12.302 --> 00:13:16.231
Okay, so we have a badge,
woo-hoo, it worked.

192
00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:18.565
But what did that live region do?

193
00:13:18.565 --> 00:13:23.129
That's the bigger question, because
that's what we're really focused on,

194
00:13:23.129 --> 00:13:26.467
it kinda motivated the thought process of,
I click here,

195
00:13:26.467 --> 00:13:29.005
something else is happening on the screen.

196
00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:33.292
So, we're gonna fire up Voiceover and
see if it worked.

197
00:13:33.292 --> 00:13:36.443
So function command F5.

198
00:13:36.443 --> 00:13:39.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Announcements, banner,
announcements, list 2 items, link,

199
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.669
gear gifts for everyone on your list,
shop our gift guide.

200
00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:42.398
Next slide.

201
00:13:42.398 --> 00:13:44.214
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: We're
going to fix it that carousel

202
00:13:44.214 --> 00:13:44.954
next-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Button-

203
00:13:44.954 --> 00:13:45.791
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Next exercise.

204
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:46.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You
are currently on the button.

205
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:49.740
To click this button,
press add to cart, button, main,

206
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.331
2 items in your shopping cart.

207
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.386
You are currently on a button to
click this button, press Control,

208
00:13:54.386 --> 00:13:56.808
Option, Space,
three items in your shopping cart.

209
00:13:56.808 --> 00:14:01.242
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So see how it waited
until everything else was done reading?

210
00:14:01.242 --> 00:14:03.371
Might be fine.

211
00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:08.887
I mean, you start to get into
user research territory.

212
00:14:08.887 --> 00:14:13.799
I think it's probably fine to
just leave it that way but for

213
00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:18.811
some, if you're working on
a design system or something,

214
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:24.750
some of these patterns would really
benefit from testing with users.

215
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:29.014
And these are compound components,
so some of these flows and

216
00:14:29.014 --> 00:14:31.802
patterns, we can make a best guess, but

217
00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:36.648
I just wanna say I'm bringing my own
developer bias to this solution.

218
00:14:36.648 --> 00:14:42.767
So, ask people, even if you can just,
I don't know, pay somebody to consult for

219
00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:47.558
an hour to explain the thing they
might even give you some ideas,

220
00:14:47.558 --> 00:14:50.151
but, yeah so, it worked though.

221
00:14:50.151 --> 00:14:54.724
We've got three items in our shopping
cart and I'm still in my navigating,

222
00:14:54.724 --> 00:14:56.232
going through the page.

223
00:14:56.232 --> 00:14:59.148
My focus is still on the button.

224
00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:00.432
So that's how live regions work.

225
00:15:00.432 --> 00:15:03.286
They're really awesome.

226
00:15:03.286 --> 00:15:06.647
Let's see what it looks like
if we make it assertive,

227
00:15:06.647 --> 00:15:11.664
just since we're talking about whether
to interrupt or not, let's try that.

228
00:15:11.664 --> 00:15:15.757
So in this solution we
have rule of status,

229
00:15:15.757 --> 00:15:20.088
if I say rule of alert,
that will interrupt.

230
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:26.112
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I am very curious
what I messed up on that other page.

231
00:15:26.112 --> 00:15:29.191
So let's fire Voiceover back up.

232
00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:30.038
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Announcements.

233
00:15:30.038 --> 00:15:34.183
Banner, announcements, list 2 items, link,
Gear Gifts for Everyone on Your List,

234
00:15:34.183 --> 00:15:37.442
Shop, Add to Cart, button, main,
4 items in your shopping cart.

235
00:15:37.442 --> 00:15:38.453
You are currently on a button.

236
00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:39.710
To click this button.

237
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.955
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So
assertive might be better, I'm not sure.

238
00:15:42.955 --> 00:15:44.120
Did you hear the little blink?

239
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.905
Like it makes a little interrupt noise.

240
00:15:46.905 --> 00:15:51.329
So I guess to back to that question
of whether you should play a noise,

241
00:15:51.329 --> 00:15:55.010
there already is a noise [LAUGH] for
the assertive alerts.

242
00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.466
Yeah, assertive might be okay,

243
00:15:56.466 --> 00:15:59.282
I guess you have to think about
what other announcements could.

244
00:15:59.282 --> 00:16:00.433
Possibly be running.

245
00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:02.961
It could be okay.

246
00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:03.747
It could be annoying.

247
00:16:03.747 --> 00:16:05.544
I'm not really sure.

248
00:16:05.544 --> 00:16:07.445
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Six items
in your shopping cart.

249
00:16:07.445 --> 00:16:12.190
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: But I think for
this type of thing, I guess assertive,

250
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:16.523
when I think through the kind
of user impact of it,

251
00:16:16.523 --> 00:16:20.462
you want to make sure
that the button worked.

252
00:16:20.462 --> 00:16:24.259
And I think now that I'm just
kind of talking out loud,

253
00:16:24.259 --> 00:16:29.214
I think that might be the right choice
because the consequence is that if

254
00:16:29.214 --> 00:16:34.811
you don't immediately know that it worked,
you might keep clicking.

255
00:16:34.811 --> 00:16:36.447
And then as a blind screen reader user,

256
00:16:36.447 --> 00:16:38.241
then how do you go remove
it from your cart?

257
00:16:38.241 --> 00:16:39.975
Then that's a whole other can of worms,

258
00:16:39.975 --> 00:16:42.638
then you have to go to another
page you have to do all the stuff.

259
00:16:42.638 --> 00:16:46.842
So I think assertive is my final answer.

260
00:16:46.842 --> 00:16:48.416
[LAUGH] Was there a question?

261
00:16:50.816 --> 00:16:53.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Does it make
sense to set roll alert for

262
00:16:53.472 --> 00:16:57.796
any kind of error notifications
that could pop up on the site.

263
00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:04.286
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Potentially,
so this is an area we

264
00:17:04.286 --> 00:17:08.482
wanna definitely verify that.

265
00:17:08.482 --> 00:17:12.931
Anytime we're talking about live regions,
I'm just like,

266
00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:17.396
hold the phone, [LAUGH] Because
we wanna be careful with them.

267
00:17:17.396 --> 00:17:22.310
As I mentioned, they can be super
annoying, like us screen reader users,

268
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:25.595
and many people will say
that they're annoying.

269
00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:30.050
So I think for error validation,

270
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:35.125
like form validation,
I do think it's appropriate.

271
00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:39.146
You can use aria-invalid for
actual form validation and

272
00:17:39.146 --> 00:17:42.923
send focus to the errors,
like say in a form context.

273
00:17:42.923 --> 00:17:45.894
There's some form fields
that you missed or

274
00:17:45.894 --> 00:17:48.872
aren't filled in correctly or something.

275
00:17:48.872 --> 00:17:52.189
And with client-side validation,
when you hit submit,

276
00:17:52.189 --> 00:17:55.123
you're doing the action
of clicking a button.

277
00:17:55.123 --> 00:17:59.891
So it's appropriate to move focus to
the first error message, I think.

278
00:17:59.891 --> 00:18:03.035
So a live region may or
may not be that useful in that context,

279
00:18:03.035 --> 00:18:06.861
where they're useful is where
you're not going to move focus.

280
00:18:06.861 --> 00:18:11.446
If you did have some sort of
an alert error banner at the top,

281
00:18:11.446 --> 00:18:14.901
I guess I just said the word alert.

282
00:18:14.901 --> 00:18:18.641
That does sound like
aria-live region situation.

283
00:18:18.641 --> 00:18:24.403
I think we want to get careful so
that it's not repeatedly announcing,

284
00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:28.541
[LAUGH] Ten minutes ago,
five minutes ago, error.

285
00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:30.126
Sounds annoying because it would be.

286
00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:34.928
So we wanna be careful that
we're not just making annoying

287
00:18:34.928 --> 00:18:40.129
announcements that we don't realize or
pummeling our users.

288
00:18:40.129 --> 00:18:43.997
Because if you don't have the screen
reader running, you probably have no idea.

289
00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:47.990
So if it's re-rendering automatically or
something,

290
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:50.827
that's what we wanna be careful about.

291
00:18:50.827 --> 00:18:54.357
I saw one technique for
live regions that makes me think of,

292
00:18:54.357 --> 00:18:55.850
I think this was preact.

293
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.561
But their solution to
client-side routing and

294
00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:02.830
screen reader announcements was to wrap
the main content in a live region,

295
00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:05.758
so anytime that updated it
would just announce it.

296
00:19:06.958 --> 00:19:13.077
Seemed kinda innovative at the time,
but now that I'm thinking about,

297
00:19:13.077 --> 00:19:19.460
like I just worked on a page that had
some sort of a reduce effect run Amok.

298
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.112
And it was just re-rendering.

299
00:19:21.112 --> 00:19:25.326
And the only way I knew was that
the console was just adding,

300
00:19:25.326 --> 00:19:27.861
adding the terminal was spinning.

301
00:19:27.861 --> 00:19:29.691
I think that page would be re-rendering.

302
00:19:29.691 --> 00:19:34.090
So if it had a live region on it
would just be constantly announcing.

303
00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:39.615
So I mean, that's a like deeper bug than
just the live region, but might kind

304
00:19:39.615 --> 00:19:45.412
of illustrate like when it's re-rendering
the screen reader might pick it up.

305
00:19:45.412 --> 00:19:50.388
I don't know you have to test it,
because there are some other settings that

306
00:19:50.388 --> 00:19:54.303
we didn't actually talk about
if I go back to live regions.

307
00:19:54.303 --> 00:19:57.450
There are, do I have any here?

308
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.162
Yep, aria-atomic and aria-relevant.

309
00:20:00.162 --> 00:20:05.178
Theoretically will change whether
it will announce additions or

310
00:20:05.178 --> 00:20:09.222
removals like how granular
is the live region?

311
00:20:09.222 --> 00:20:13.533
It hasn't been super reliable
across platform, but

312
00:20:13.533 --> 00:20:18.909
hopefully with a live region,
if it literally is re-rendering.

313
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:23.438
The same things over and over again, it
shouldn't just announce it over and over.

314
00:20:23.438 --> 00:20:29.298
But again, it's like this is an area that
we do wanna test in a screen reader.

315
00:20:29.298 --> 00:20:32.158
So hopefully, you see some motivation to

316
00:20:32.158 --> 00:20:36.581
add that in your workflow if you
have a use case for live regions.

317
00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:41.381
And we do wanna see if I can
fix our TypeScript error.

318
00:20:41.381 --> 00:20:46.328
So that one was in product header.

319
00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:49.699
You know what I'm gonna do is-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Someone said,

320
00:20:49.699 --> 00:20:53.461
I think it might have to do with
the default value, maybe null.

321
00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.061
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Yeah,
we changed that, I thought.

322
00:20:55.061 --> 00:20:55.561
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Sorry.

323
00:20:57.001 --> 00:21:00.359
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So
shopping cart items, we have an array.

324
00:21:01.752 --> 00:21:03.414
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Array of products.

325
00:21:10.565 --> 00:21:13.951
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Wait,
maybe I didn't update that page.

326
00:21:13.951 --> 00:21:15.999
I think I might have fixed the wrong one.

327
00:21:19.513 --> 00:21:21.046
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Maybe that was it.

328
00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:23.891
I swear I edited that in the right place.

329
00:21:26.831 --> 00:21:27.687
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I remember doing it,

330
00:21:27.687 --> 00:21:31.316
that's the problem with having
multiple versions of the same thing.

331
00:21:31.316 --> 00:21:34.294
Well, it worked, but my styling is off.

332
00:21:34.294 --> 00:21:35.740
I'm gonna call that a win.

333
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:37.943
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: [LAUGH] So yeah,

334
00:21:37.943 --> 00:21:44.748
it's like inception with a demo inside of
another React, the rest of the React site.

335
00:21:44.748 --> 00:21:51.607
So some styling, but at least the bones
are there, the functionality works.

336
00:21:51.607 --> 00:21:55.070
And the live region should announce there.

337
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:59.989
So one thing I didn't show you is that you
can inspect just like any other element

338
00:21:59.989 --> 00:22:01.404
with a live region.

339
00:22:01.404 --> 00:22:05.074
So I guess it would be
up here in the header.

340
00:22:05.074 --> 00:22:09.513
Just to make sure it rendered,
sometimes we're using React

341
00:22:09.513 --> 00:22:14.224
where you only output an element
if a certain condition is true.

342
00:22:15.244 --> 00:22:18.004
Sometimes you'll be like, well,
why didn't that element render?

343
00:22:18.004 --> 00:22:21.832
It could be something with your
state variables or something, so

344
00:22:21.832 --> 00:22:26.365
you can always go to the dev tools and
see, like, it's not announcing.

345
00:22:26.365 --> 00:22:28.353
Is that for some other reason, or

346
00:22:28.353 --> 00:22:33.302
is it because my live region didn't
actually end up in the rendered document?

347
00:22:33.302 --> 00:22:35.312
So it's there.

348
00:22:35.312 --> 00:22:38.404
If it doesn't announce, even though
you see it in there, it might be for

349
00:22:38.404 --> 00:22:39.900
some other reason.

350
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.876
Like maybe display none or I'm not sure,

351
00:22:42.876 --> 00:22:48.075
maybe the messages aren't making it
to the right element or something.
