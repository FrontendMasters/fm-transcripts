1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.504
Well, now that I've told you all
this information, let's apply it,

2
00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.230
let's do some testing.

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.848
So we have our first exercise,

4
00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:13.790
our first exercise is to try and
navigate a screen reader.

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.793
So here in class, I'll do this so
that we can do it together, and

6
00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:23.195
I'm gonna turn on the screen reader,
so you'll get to hear VoiceOver.

7
00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:29.365
We have this Book A Trip form,
mimicked after one on an airline website.

8
00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:32.389
And so this is built with React,

9
00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:38.440
I can change it from one-way to two-way,
[LAUGH] a return trip.

10
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.992
Pretty simple form, it has
the default browser date pickers, so

11
00:00:42.992 --> 00:00:47.381
we can see how accessible
the default date pickers are.

12
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:52.117
There's also this little children
widget that has buttons to,

13
00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:54.845
if you were gonna fly with 12 kids.

14
00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:58.772
[LAUGH] I was figuring out what
my maximum should be or, yeah,

15
00:00:58.772 --> 00:01:03.628
12 children, you could really choose
chaos and fly with 12 children.

16
00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:08.724
But this adult strapped down is
a native HTML select element,

17
00:01:08.724 --> 00:01:10.786
so we can play with that.

18
00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:15.446
And there's a couple images down
here just to get us inspired for

19
00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:20.108
adventure travel of the North Cascades
a couple of months ago and

20
00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:24.366
Hawaii, [SOUND] that just sound so
nice, warmer weather.

21
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.229
So let's open this up with VoiceOver.

22
00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.032
So I'm on a Mac to Mac computer, so

23
00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:34.649
to open up VoiceOver I will
hold my Function key first.

24
00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.612
If you have a desktop keyboard,
you won't have a Function key, but

25
00:01:39.612 --> 00:01:43.370
on a Mac laptop,
it would be function command F5.

26
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.993
&gt;&gt; Navigation, visited,
link, heading level 1,

27
00:01:45.993 --> 00:01:49.936
Web Accessibility, V3, current item,
visited, link, All Topics.

28
00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:53.816
Search documentation,
search text field, blank, Cmd+K, link.

29
00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:57.898
&gt;&gt; So at any time, a little bit of
a navigation tip when you're running

30
00:01:57.898 --> 00:02:02.643
VoiceOver is that to get it to stop
reading, you can press the Control key.

31
00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:06.167
So especially when you're talking,
[LAUGH] at the same time,

32
00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:07.671
it can be pretty helpful.

33
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:11.236
You can also click on the page to kind
of get to an area that you wanna test so

34
00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:13.873
you don't have to navigate
through the whole thing.

35
00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:16.799
Cuz I want us to focus on
this book of trip form,

36
00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.187
whereas there are a ton of other elements
on the page for the slide materials.

37
00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:25.810
So I'm gonna click closer to this form,
I could even click on-

38
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.496
&gt;&gt; Level 1, link, Permalink for

39
00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:30.907
this section, main,
you are currently on a link.

40
00:02:30.907 --> 00:02:35.971
&gt;&gt; So my first key that I often use is the
Tab key, let's hit Tab, see what happens.

41
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:39.512
&gt;&gt; One-Way, unchecked, checkbox,
Book a Flight, group, checked, One-Way,

42
00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:40.126
check files.

43
00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:43.360
&gt;&gt; If I hit the space bar,
I can toggle that element,

44
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.124
depending on what element it is, what type
of role and keyboard accessibility it has.

45
00:02:49.124 --> 00:02:51.274
&gt;&gt; Use miles, unchecked, checkbox.

46
00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:52.443
&gt;&gt; And I can through these.

47
00:02:52.443 --> 00:02:53.524
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] checked,
Use miles, checkbox.

48
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:58.324
&gt;&gt; And so the Tab key, however,
is not the only way to navigate.

49
00:02:58.324 --> 00:03:03.201
So from that cheat sheet, I referenced
myself this morning to remember,

50
00:03:03.201 --> 00:03:07.675
there are the VoiceOver keys
which are Control and Option.

51
00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:11.015
And if I do Control-Option-Right Arrow,
I can go to the next item,

52
00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:13.035
whatever that item happens to be.

53
00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:17.698
&gt;&gt; From, you are currently on a text
element, From edit text, You are to,

54
00:03:17.698 --> 00:03:22.045
you are currently on a text element,
edit text, blank.

55
00:03:22.045 --> 00:03:26.023
Departure Date, you are currently
on a Departure Date, edit text.

56
00:03:26.023 --> 00:03:29.185
You are currently on an edit text,
to enter the state field,

57
00:03:29.185 --> 00:03:31.675
press Control-Option-Shift-Down Arrow.

58
00:03:31.675 --> 00:03:35.395
03, you are currently on a stepper,

59
00:03:35.395 --> 00:03:40.388
inside minus 2024, end of text-
&gt;&gt; So I can use Arrow keys,

60
00:03:40.388 --> 00:03:43.881
I can type,
I can do all kinds of things in here.

61
00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:47.814
So depending on what type of element
it is, so if it's a text field,

62
00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:52.506
if it's an image, if it's a heading,
it will announce that type of element, so

63
00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:54.591
that's relevant.

64
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:59.711
If things are labeled or not, that will
also be part of it, so this form field.

65
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.486
&gt;&gt; From,
you are currently on a text element.

66
00:04:02.486 --> 00:04:03.700
&gt;&gt; Is labeled.

67
00:04:05.657 --> 00:04:08.471
If I go down further to images.

68
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:10.645
&gt;&gt; Edit text, 01-
&gt;&gt; Then I'm gonna hit Tab to get

69
00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:11.291
there quickly.

70
00:04:11.291 --> 00:04:14.630
&gt;&gt; Submit, level 1, link, visited,
link, Other Assistive Technologies,

71
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.869
Character Pallette, close button,
Chrome, Screen, make your escape,

72
00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:21.226
a dirt path next to a small lake, with
Fall colors of red, yellow, and green.

73
00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:24.367
The sky is blue with wispy high clouds
image, you are currently on the image.

74
00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:25.665
&gt;&gt; So there's small text.

75
00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:31.713
So it's fun to navigate around,
you can play with the screen reader,

76
00:04:31.713 --> 00:04:33.495
and then we'll come back.

77
00:04:39.896 --> 00:04:44.760
We were testing with VoiceOver on the Mac,
there was one more part of it

78
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.790
that I wanted to show you
just before we get going.

79
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.010
So i'm gonna fire VoiceOver back
up with function command F5.

80
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.050
&gt;&gt; Navigation, visited,
link, heading level 1.

81
00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.091
&gt;&gt; There is a feature in VoiceOver called
the rotor that you should know about.

82
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:06.543
It is a tool that I use quite often,
so VoiceOver, I'd say I test it,

83
00:05:06.543 --> 00:05:12.371
maybe a couple times a week if I'm
actively developing a user interface.

84
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:17.251
Maybe not every single time I
go to test it, but I do test it

85
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:22.849
regularly to checkout specific
things if I'm working on a form or

86
00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.183
something that I want to
know what's going on.

87
00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:28.346
So with the rotor,

88
00:05:28.346 --> 00:05:32.723
I can open it with the VoiceOver
keys which are Control option and U.

89
00:05:32.723 --> 00:05:37.729
&gt;&gt; Links menu on item All Topics, current-
&gt;&gt; So the the rotor is configurable in

90
00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.830
your VoiceOver utility, and it will
list out everything that's on the page.

91
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.735
So we're looking at links right now,
this is showing everything on this whole

92
00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:51.820
workshop resources site or
what's on the current page.

93
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.008
If I use the left or right arrow keys, I
can go through different types of groups.

94
00:05:56.008 --> 00:05:58.584
&gt;&gt; Landmarks menu, on item complimentary.

95
00:05:58.584 --> 00:06:02.431
&gt;&gt; So the landmarks and I can arrow up or
down to have it highlight those things.

96
00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:05.794
And then if I hit the enter key
it would take me to that element.

97
00:06:05.794 --> 00:06:07.657
&gt;&gt; Table of contents navigation,

98
00:06:07.657 --> 00:06:12.286
Form Controls menu on item search
documentation, search text field, blank.

99
00:06:12.286 --> 00:06:13.410
&gt;&gt; All the form controls.

100
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.186
&gt;&gt; Headings menu on item 1.

101
00:06:15.186 --> 00:06:18.368
&gt;&gt; All the headings, so
this one's pretty useful,

102
00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:23.289
which headings are on the page, what
number do they have, so that one, two,

103
00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.495
those are the heading levels,
so an h1 or an h2.

104
00:06:26.495 --> 00:06:32.074
And it can be pretty useful to see what
is VoiceOver picking up on our page.

105
00:06:32.074 --> 00:06:36.930
And so as developers, there's a bit
of a learning curve, I would say.

106
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.450
You could see I'm not super
proficient with VoiceOver,

107
00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.030
but I do test it to become more familiar.

108
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.684
I referenced those cheat sheets and
I use the rotor.

109
00:06:46.684 --> 00:06:49.782
It is super helpful to be able
to look at things at a glance.

110
00:06:49.782 --> 00:06:51.322
&gt;&gt; Buttons menu on item-
&gt;&gt; On your button.

111
00:06:51.322 --> 00:06:53.565
&gt;&gt; Introduction, button, group.

112
00:06:53.565 --> 00:06:55.575
&gt;&gt; So to get out of the rotor,
I'll hit Escape.

113
00:06:55.575 --> 00:06:56.885
&gt;&gt; Visited, link, heading level 1.

114
00:06:56.885 --> 00:06:59.230
&gt;&gt; And then I can turn VoiceOver off.

115
00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.620
&gt;&gt; You are currently on the link,
VoiceOver off.

116
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.582
&gt;&gt; That little x, it's often
the quickest way to turn it off.

117
00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:09.032
You can also use the same command of
the function command F5 to turn it off.

118
00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:09.860
So the rotor,

119
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:15.392
I wanted to show to you before we move on
just because of what a helpful tool it is.

120
00:07:15.392 --> 00:07:18.981
Sometimes it can be effective at
communicating with your colleagues like,

121
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:21.622
no, we really do need
to make these changes.

122
00:07:21.622 --> 00:07:26.591
And if you can show them what's happening
in the screen reader somehow that can be

123
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:27.184
useful.
