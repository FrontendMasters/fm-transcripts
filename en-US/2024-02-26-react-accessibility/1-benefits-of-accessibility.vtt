1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.504
We talked a little bit about the range
of experience that people have

2
00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.124
with disability that it's so varied.

3
00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:11.971
This really comes through in how
people interact with computers and

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:13.253
mobile devices.

5
00:00:13.253 --> 00:00:19.061
We can think about how people surf, some
people use the mouse, some people don't.

6
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:21.960
Some people use things
called switch devices,

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.954
which are small keyboard devices
that have a limited set of keys.

8
00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:29.952
So if you have limited motion,
but you can hit a couple of keys,

9
00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:33.659
you have an easier interface
to get through the computer.

10
00:00:33.659 --> 00:00:35.386
Some people use head wands.

11
00:00:35.386 --> 00:00:41.422
If you're quadriplegic or paraplegic and
you have limited use of your limbs,

12
00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:44.817
there are other ways
of navigating the web.

13
00:00:44.817 --> 00:00:48.076
And so if we really focus on the basics,
amazingly,

14
00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:52.236
we can sort of support some of
these technologies that people use.

15
00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:57.960
And so even more of a reason to learn
the basics of web accessibility.

16
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.152
So let's start busting some
myths about accessibility.

17
00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:06.325
Some of the things that I've seen
crop up that are misconceptions.

18
00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:10.814
So first, screen readers use JavaScript.

19
00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:15.578
Don't need to make a no JS site for
a screen reader to use it.

20
00:01:15.578 --> 00:01:23.133
They look at the page as rendered and that
ss rendered, that's gonna come up a lot.

21
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.839
I mentioned shadow DOM and web components,

22
00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:30.517
that's kind of the term I learned in
how accessibility would apply to that,

23
00:01:30.517 --> 00:01:34.117
was that it's important that
it's how it gets rendered.

24
00:01:34.117 --> 00:01:38.369
It's like the whole thing and
the rendered source of the page, so

25
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.314
screen readers rely on that.

26
00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:45.169
That said, screen readers are not
the only aspect of accessibility.

27
00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:50.300
We'll dive into it quite a bit, but we're
gonna hopefully give you lots of tips and

28
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.131
techniques for more than just
screen reader accessibility.

29
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:56.554
People also navigate by voice, and

30
00:01:56.554 --> 00:02:01.578
this is one area that semantic HTML
in particular, will really help out.

31
00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:09.297
One question that I've gotten is,
can we track screen readers to know kinda

32
00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:14.018
how people are using our sites,
how many people are using screen readers?

33
00:02:14.018 --> 00:02:15.668
And the answer is no.

34
00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:21.111
And it's not for a technical reason, it's
actually for a privacy reason, mostly.

35
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:25.241
I have an article in the in
the slides from Marco Ziva.

36
00:02:25.241 --> 00:02:28.283
He worked at Mozilla for
a long time, he's blind and

37
00:02:28.283 --> 00:02:33.207
he wrote very passionately about why we
shouldn't track screen readers on the web.

38
00:02:33.207 --> 00:02:37.499
And I'll read this quote, he said, letting
a website know you're using a screen

39
00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.477
reader, means running around the web
waving a red flag that shouts, here,

40
00:02:41.477 --> 00:02:44.921
I'm visually impaired to blind at
anyone who is willing to look.

41
00:02:44.921 --> 00:02:50.824
And so we don't want to track
people who don't wanna be tracked.

42
00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:54.063
He said that it was the one place,
being the web,

43
00:02:54.063 --> 00:02:59.672
that blind people could navigate around
relatively undetected without comments or

44
00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:03.789
without needing help if something
was actually accessible.

45
00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:08.772
I thought that's really powerful to be
able to help people live more independent

46
00:03:08.772 --> 00:03:11.571
lives just by making
stuff more accessible.

47
00:03:11.571 --> 00:03:15.559
That's an impact that we don't
necessarily think about all the time.

48
00:03:18.125 --> 00:03:22.147
So yeah, lots of ways that people use the
Web and we just wanna build it accessibly.

49
00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:27.250
And just let it be,
we're not gonna try and track people.

50
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.889
There are some areas of analytics,
if you're really curious about that,

51
00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:32.169
we can talk about it more.

52
00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:38.125
But for screen readers in particular,
we do not wanna track people.

53
00:03:38.125 --> 00:03:42.963
So we have some overlapping
areas of accessibility

54
00:03:42.963 --> 00:03:47.244
that kind of feed into
that persuasion area.

55
00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:52.806
If you need to convince people of, how can
we line this up with our other objectives?

56
00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:58.047
There are some overlaps starting with
Search-Engine Optimization, SEO.

57
00:03:58.047 --> 00:04:03.376
So accessibility doesn't
directly affect how websites

58
00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:09.044
are ranked in things like Google or
Bing, but headings are.

59
00:04:09.044 --> 00:04:13.745
There was kind of unfortunate practice
in SEO of just jamming as much as

60
00:04:13.745 --> 00:04:17.649
many key words that you could
into a page and fortunately,

61
00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.771
that's not the way people
do things anymore.

62
00:04:20.771 --> 00:04:24.732
But those heading tags
are still very important.

63
00:04:24.732 --> 00:04:30.526
They tell Googlebot or blind people,
how a page is structured.

64
00:04:30.526 --> 00:04:34.250
And so that semantic markup that
we put into our pages helps

65
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.757
both accessibility and
search engine optimization.

66
00:04:37.757 --> 00:04:43.877
And also using links in and out of
your site kinda create this network,

67
00:04:43.877 --> 00:04:48.245
yeah, it just adds some
legitimacy to your site.

68
00:04:48.245 --> 00:04:53.364
Links are good for navigating,
they work great in screen readers and

69
00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:57.347
with the keyboard, and so
that's another overlap.

70
00:04:57.347 --> 00:05:02.030
Performance, which we will talk
about later in our design section.

71
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.870
But if a site loads fast,
you can interact with it quicker.

72
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.906
It's kinda good for
everyone, it's like, yeah,

73
00:05:08.906 --> 00:05:11.742
accessibility really is
a benefit to everyone.

74
00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:15.717
There's a talk that I've linked
in the slides from Eric Bailey

75
00:05:15.717 --> 00:05:17.817
at the PerfMatters conference.

76
00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:22.517
It was one of my favorite things
about accessibility and performance.

77
00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:25.923
if you're a performance person,
or interested in it,

78
00:05:25.923 --> 00:05:29.985
I would highly recommend checking
out that talk from Eric Bailey.

79
00:05:29.985 --> 00:05:33.587
And again, we'll talk a lot
more about performance later.

80
00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:39.362
Security, I touched on this briefly, but
if your user interface isn't accessible,

81
00:05:39.362 --> 00:05:42.381
it can be become a privacy or
security issue.

82
00:05:42.381 --> 00:05:47.333
If you think of an ATM or
like a point of sale system or something,

83
00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:51.830
if a person can't interact
with it without getting help,

84
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.511
they can't do it independently.

85
00:05:54.511 --> 00:05:59.626
So we wanna try and make our
interfaces either physical interfaces

86
00:05:59.626 --> 00:06:04.389
are kinda an analog to the digital
ones that we're creating.

87
00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:10.115
But we don't wanna force someone to make a
choice between access and security, which

88
00:06:10.115 --> 00:06:15.617
is really interesting to me, like those
kind of overlaps are super fascinating.

89
00:06:15.617 --> 00:06:19.871
Customer and business growth, I mean,
the more accessible your site is,

90
00:06:19.871 --> 00:06:21.434
the more people can use it.

91
00:06:21.434 --> 00:06:25.141
Or the flip side of it,
the less accessible your site is,

92
00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:29.407
the fewer people can use it,
the fewer customers you might have.

93
00:06:29.407 --> 00:06:34.695
For accessible platforms,
if they're accessible from the start,

94
00:06:34.695 --> 00:06:39.723
then you could have more early
adopters that have disabilities.

95
00:06:39.723 --> 00:06:44.196
It's unfortunately left out, accessibility
is left out often early in the process

96
00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:47.540
when that's precisely when we
need to think about it the most.

97
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:52.011
And so I think it can help your
growth of your business to be

98
00:06:52.011 --> 00:06:55.936
considering accessibility
from the beginning.

99
00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:58.955
You also have the benefit
of having less debt.

100
00:06:58.955 --> 00:07:03.371
We talked about access debt that accrues
over time and it can be really hard to

101
00:07:03.371 --> 00:07:07.583
root out when it's in the DNA of your
business or the DNA of your product.

102
00:07:07.583 --> 00:07:09.836
And so the earlier we tackle this,
the better.
