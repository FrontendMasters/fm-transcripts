WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.010
All right, so
let's fix some code, shall we?

2
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.961
If you haven't already
pulled down the project,

3
00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:10.116
this is gonna be our first example
where we really go dig into the code.

4
00:00:10.116 --> 00:00:13.794
So our repo and
our project is built with Next.js.

5
00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:16.640
So if we're going to look
at React quite a bit today.

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.357
But anything that we do with React will
apply to web accessibility in general.

7
00:00:22.357 --> 00:00:25.721
What we wanna focus on at
the end of everything is what

8
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:27.717
is rendered in a browser?

9
00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:29.947
What is a user going to experience?

10
00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:34.741
So keep that in mind, kind of regardless
of the framework, the technology,

11
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:38.005
we're really focused on
that end user experience.

12
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:41.208
Okay, so a quick spin through our GitHub.

13
00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.436
You can clone this,

14
00:00:42.436 --> 00:00:46.778
you can also just follow along if you
want to observe what we're doing.

15
00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:50.342
I'll explain everything,
we'll go through all the examples.

16
00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:54.220
But you can clone this repository,
and then there are some

17
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.752
setup instructions in here on how to
get this running on your machine.

18
00:00:59.752 --> 00:01:05.161
There's also a link over here on the side,
you can open up the fully built

19
00:01:05.161 --> 00:01:10.406
version of this including the examples
in their more working states.

20
00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:15.783
I wouldn't say they're perfectly final
because accessibility is always a work

21
00:01:15.783 --> 00:01:21.329
in progress, but there are more complete
examples that I'll show you in a minute.

22
00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.402
So I've got this already pulled down.

23
00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:26.060
I used VS Code as my text editor, so

24
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.372
let's take a little bit of a tour
through here to get started.

25
00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:36.336
I've got the ReadMe open right now,
but over here in my File Explorer,

26
00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:41.074
we've got Pages, which is how
the course materials are broken up.

27
00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:46.291
A lot of our attention will be
spent in the components directory.

28
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:52.301
So this has a series of UI components that
have accessibility issues built into them.

29
00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:56.351
And as we go through the topics,
we will work on those.

30
00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:01.673
And the more finished versions are in
the completed components directory.

31
00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:04.913
So you can always look ahead,
you can compare,

32
00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:08.724
do a diff between what we had and
what we're working on.

33
00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:13.422
And so that's kind of the structure
of how our exercises are split up.

34
00:02:13.422 --> 00:02:19.713
So we're on exercise 3, fix some HTML.

35
00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:24.114
I guess before I go over here, I'll
show you what it is that we're fixing.

36
00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:27.591
So we have a product for a dog float coat,

37
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:34.024
in case you wanna go kayaking or
stand-up paddling with your dog.

38
00:02:34.024 --> 00:02:37.884
They're going to need a PFD or
a personal flotation device.

39
00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:41.197
So this product that maybe
I buy somebody's dog for

40
00:02:41.197 --> 00:02:44.618
Christmas or something has a product page.

41
00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.198
It's kind of in progress.

42
00:02:47.198 --> 00:02:52.308
It has a ton of components in it,
but take a lot of time to build.

43
00:02:52.308 --> 00:02:58.169
But there's some varying degrees
of accessibility or not built in.

44
00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.076
So our mission in this exercise
is to find as much that we

45
00:03:03.076 --> 00:03:06.503
can improve focused on the HTML part.

46
00:03:06.503 --> 00:03:10.169
We're gonna build on this in
the next few examples, but

47
00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.857
let's see if we can fix some
HTML that we find in here.

48
00:03:13.857 --> 00:03:16.805
So there's a little color picker.

49
00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:20.481
It's not totally hooked up to
the bigger image gallery yet, but

50
00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:22.940
it does have these little lists of images.

51
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.155
We have a size picker.

52
00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:29.241
There is the start of
a photo gallery here.

53
00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:31.803
So speaking of dialogues, that, hint hint,

54
00:03:31.803 --> 00:03:34.508
could be something that
we make into a dialogue.

55
00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:41.066
It's basically just like the first attempt
at getting a layer to cover the content.

56
00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:47.102
So our approach for that, we are totally
open-ended what we can do with that.

57
00:03:47.102 --> 00:03:51.747
That'll especially be later in
our focus management section.

58
00:03:51.747 --> 00:03:52.683
But let's see what else.

59
00:03:52.683 --> 00:03:54.701
So we've got some buttons down here.

60
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.005
We have a little quantity selector.

61
00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:58.564
So like how are those marked up?

62
00:03:58.564 --> 00:04:00.005
We can go look at those.

63
00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:03.107
So there are some debugging tips on here.

64
00:04:03.107 --> 00:04:10.379
So we want to look at keyboard controls,
so that's kind of in the realm of HTML,

65
00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.840
what elements are in there
that are accessible?

66
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.154
We'll get more advanced with
focus management a little later.

67
00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:23.853
But headings, landmarks, and accessible
names, those are all in the scope of this.

68
00:04:23.853 --> 00:04:30.789
So our form labels are any links,
any image alt text.

69
00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:35.312
And we can inspect the DOM and
run extensions.

70
00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:39.334
So this component is
embedded in this page.

71
00:04:39.334 --> 00:04:43.401
So I can go in here and
inspect it, and go check it out.

72
00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:48.761
There's also a full page not
in the slide deck and it is,

73
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:56.671
I think this might be the more complete
version of it if you want to test that.

74
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.685
And so
there's one that's like full screen.

75
00:05:02.854 --> 00:05:04.672
Okay, so,
let's go see where this code lives.

76
00:05:07.514 --> 00:05:09.214
So, product page,

77
00:05:09.214 --> 00:05:15.116
that's the kind of top level page
component that pulls in the header.

78
00:05:15.116 --> 00:05:16.149
There's an image gallery.

79
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:21.891
So, basically anything with the word
product in it, in the component names,

80
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:26.331
those are all going to affect
the the component on that page.

81
00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:31.482
And it is sort of the first go-around for
these.

82
00:05:31.482 --> 00:05:35.918
So it might not be quite as sophisticated
as the real site would have, but

83
00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:38.771
it has the start to some
of the functionality.

84
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.777
So there's the image gallery component.

85
00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:44.671
And if you're new to React,
so we have a lot of logic and

86
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:49.091
functions that are little utilities
that you can call up top.

87
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:51.046
There's a little bit
of TypeScript in here.

88
00:05:51.046 --> 00:05:52.513
And then if you scroll down,

89
00:05:52.513 --> 00:05:55.706
the JSX down below is basically
where all of our markup lives.

90
00:05:57.426 --> 00:06:00.728
And so the header has multiple
components in a file.

91
00:06:00.728 --> 00:06:03.774
There's the little banner up at the top.

92
00:06:03.774 --> 00:06:07.931
That gets pulled into the product header,

93
00:06:07.931 --> 00:06:13.941
which is a little further down,
product details, and so on.

94
00:06:13.941 --> 00:06:17.770
And we'll go poke around in here and
make some changes.

95
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:22.244
If you have any issues setting
up the project, let us know and

96
00:06:22.244 --> 00:06:26.120
then we'll come back and
code some fixes together.
