00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.714
One of our basic things, like I
mentioned in the beginning that a lot of

2
00:00:04.714 --> 00:00:09.654
the accessibility issues that are out
in the world are fortunately the really

3
00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:14.340
easy things to fix, a kind of
an optimistic way of looking at it.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.390
Alternative text is one of the biggest.

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.453
So for any image or graphic on
the screen that has content that

6
00:00:22.453 --> 00:00:27.416
we want to describe,
cuz not everything is worthy of that,

7
00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:32.798
we have to provide what's called
alternative text or alt text.

8
00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:38.313
And let me stop you right there,
it is not alt tags, a bit of a pet peeve

9
00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:43.466
of accessibility people is that
it is alt text, caught myself.

10
00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:44.928
It's not the tag, so

11
00:00:44.928 --> 00:00:50.626
the image tag becomes the image element
using those platform APIs we talked about.

12
00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:53.791
So it becomes an image object, and

13
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:59.056
the alt attribute is how we supply
alternative text, for the most part.

14
00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:06.864
So there's an image on the screen of the
file name of the image is the-big-one.jpg.

15
00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:10.857
If we didn't have the alt text,
and it just said the-big-one,

16
00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:13.192
no one's gonna know what that means.

17
00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:17.310
Cuz that's what happens is if we don't
include an alt attribute at all,

18
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.309
it will try to read the file name,
which may or may not be informative.

19
00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:26.597
It could be cached, I mean,
it could just be gibberish.

20
00:01:26.597 --> 00:01:32.320
And I even have an example here of
a data URI, data:image/jpeg;base64,

21
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.144
blah, blah, blah, no one's gonna
read that, it'd be terrible.

22
00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:42.846
So the risk of not including alt text
is that it is just not anything that

23
00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:45.644
will communicate what's on the screen.

24
00:01:45.644 --> 00:01:46.410
So instead,

25
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.810
this picture of a big pizza has the alt
attribute of a huge pepperoni pizza.

26
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.647
And I took this example because
it was from a quote from someone,

27
00:01:56.647 --> 00:02:00.426
a blind person that I'm
friends with on Facebook.

28
00:02:00.426 --> 00:02:06.020
And they were really feeling left out that
people weren't describing their images.

29
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.530
And it was a pepperoni pizza was the
example, they were left out of the joke.

30
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.470
And so we wanna include that context and
describe what's in the image.

31
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.508
Note I didn't use the word image of or
photo of, I just said what's in it.

32
00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:26.328
Just describe it, be brief,
be brief, but descriptive.

33
00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:30.586
It can be kind of an art,
[LAUGH] creating alt text.

34
00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:34.638
I will say, I mean, since that person
wrote that, I think they work at Facebook.

35
00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:39.160
So it might have been part of an
announcement of their API's for generating

36
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.135
alt text automatically, which Facebook
does now, but they're not that great.

37
00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:49.330
I mean it will be like,
object may contain round thing or pizza,

38
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.315
it's not very artistic, or,
I mean I have a degree in photojournalism.

39
00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:58.585
So captions are part of the content.

40
00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:01.375
So if we can supply alt text, we should,

41
00:03:01.375 --> 00:03:05.116
cuz we're gonna do
a better job than AI will.

42
00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:09.856
So the risks are big, especially when
it's like, that's just one image.

43
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:14.475
But yeah, multiply that times how many
times this happens all over the Internet.

44
00:03:14.475 --> 00:03:21.751
And it is one of the top five
accessibility issues is lacking alt text.

45
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:24.332
Also, we should say, though,

46
00:03:24.332 --> 00:03:30.354
that not every image is going to be
descriptive enough to require alt text,

47
00:03:30.354 --> 00:03:35.648
like the actual alt text content,
we can skip over it.

48
00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:39.018
So there is a thing
called decorative images.

49
00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:44.079
Like if you have, I don't know,
spacer GIFs or images of decorative

50
00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.511
borders that you somehow couldn't
create with CSS for whatever reason.

51
00:03:49.511 --> 00:03:54.140
You're not gonna say alt = border,
probably, I mean,

52
00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:00.384
you have to make that judgment call of,
is this decorative or not?

53
00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:04.466
And if it is, you can have the screen
reader not read out that file name by

54
00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:06.387
putting an empty alt attribute.

55
00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:12.038
And there are some times when maybe this
is what you wanna do because of what's

56
00:04:12.038 --> 00:04:13.185
wrapping the image.

57
00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:15.685
Like if it's in a button or in a link,

58
00:04:15.685 --> 00:04:19.397
you might change how you
decide what to put in there.

59
00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:24.220
And for that use case, or
any of these contextual decisions that you

60
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.127
have to make, there is this awesome
resource called the alt decision

61
00:04:29.127 --> 00:04:33.603
tree that will walk you through
how to make these decisions.

62
00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:35.453
So, does it contain text?

63
00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:37.273
No, okay, continue.

64
00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:40.273
Yes, and, and
then you can go through these scenarios.

65
00:04:40.273 --> 00:04:42.761
Or, is it used in a link or a button?

66
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:48.278
And so, this can be super helpful,
cuz there's so many different

67
00:04:48.278 --> 00:04:53.371
scenarios where you have to decide what
would make a good piece of alt text.

68
00:04:55.181 --> 00:05:01.415
So some great advice, I have this one
bookmarked also, so keep that one handy.

69
00:05:05.026 --> 00:05:11.046
And CSS background images are another
case where, rather than image tags,

70
00:05:11.046 --> 00:05:15.858
you have background images generated for
whatever reason.

71
00:05:15.858 --> 00:05:20.253
An example of how I came along this
technique was actually working for

72
00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.393
Target on their annual reports.

73
00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:25.306
We had a lot of data tables
that were super stylized.

74
00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:29.036
And this was before we
could use CSS grid and

75
00:05:29.036 --> 00:05:32.981
a lot of the modern style
styling we have now.

76
00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:36.223
You can embed an infographic or
a table, and

77
00:05:36.223 --> 00:05:40.432
then basically mark up behind
it what is actually in it.

78
00:05:40.432 --> 00:05:43.997
And so if you have a background
image laying over that, you could

79
00:05:43.997 --> 00:05:48.437
even toggle the image on and off if you
wanted to let people choose which format.

80
00:05:48.437 --> 00:05:52.342
Do they want the stylized one,
or the actual data table?

81
00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:53.992
You could let them choose.

82
00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:58.784
But if you wanted to sort of mock up
the alt text behind the background image

83
00:05:58.784 --> 00:06:03.520
with way more content than you could
possibly fit into an alt attribute.

84
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.338
Cuz there is a limit, and, yeah,
I mean, it's a string, right?

85
00:06:08.338 --> 00:06:13.352
You can't put markup in there,
so if you needed to have

86
00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:20.553
a more complex alternative bit of content,
you can do this technique.

87
00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:21.678
I have one here for

88
00:06:21.678 --> 00:06:26.183
the most popular licensed dog breeds
in town from a police department.

89
00:06:26.183 --> 00:06:30.802
And so you can mark the image,
get that to show up, and

90
00:06:30.802 --> 00:06:33.684
make it responsive or whatever.

91
00:06:33.684 --> 00:06:37.890
And then you can put content
inside of that element and

92
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.327
give it a CSS class, visually-hidden
is the one that I have in here.

93
00:06:43.327 --> 00:06:47.357
It's also called sr-only, or
screen reader only, sometimes.

94
00:06:47.357 --> 00:06:51.301
And this technique will clip
that content and, basically,

95
00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:54.407
hide it visually, but
it still gets rendered.

96
00:06:55.427 --> 00:06:58.443
There's that word again,
it still gets rendered, so

97
00:06:58.443 --> 00:07:02.056
it will be part of the accessibility tree,
we just won't see it.

98
00:07:02.056 --> 00:07:04.908
So there's our first mention
of the accessibility tree.

99
00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:08.348
It comes up right away [LAUGH] for
image alt text.

100
00:07:09.628 --> 00:07:11.400
So for this technique,

101
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:16.636
I used a role of image on the div that
has a background image asset on it.

102
00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:21.565
And I'm describing it, so
it's got the image role, it also needs

103
00:07:21.565 --> 00:07:26.858
a little bit of extra help to say what
is the description for this image.

104
00:07:26.858 --> 00:07:31.911
And I pointed it to the ID
of the content behind it.

105
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:35.951
So dog background text, and
it's got an h2 in there.

106
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:38.778
It's got a paragraph for
this little subheader for

107
00:07:38.778 --> 00:07:42.385
the source of
the Hutchison Police Department.

108
00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:47.390
And then I described the graph, graph with
six bars showing different dog breeds and

109
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.645
all of their different rankings.

110
00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:54.384
And surprise, the labrador
retriever is the most popular.

111
00:07:54.384 --> 00:07:59.407
[LAUGH] So it's cute doggies,
but you could use this technique

112
00:07:59.407 --> 00:08:04.052
if you have background images
that you need to describe.

113
00:08:04.052 --> 00:08:07.571
And as I mentioned, having a toggle
to actually show the table.

114
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:11.624
If it was more tabular data than this,
I described what was in it in this case.

115
00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:17.545
But sometimes you might really have
figures and tables and all that stuff.

116
00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:21.435
Hopefully you can style
things pretty well now.

117
00:08:21.435 --> 00:08:25.381
Just know that there's alternative
ways of presenting information.

118
00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:28.680
And then I mentioned
the Facebook AI alt text,

119
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.665
cuz that always comes up,
people just want to not do it.

120
00:08:32.665 --> 00:08:36.137
[LAUGH] So
can we have a computer do it for us?

121
00:08:36.137 --> 00:08:40.917
You could try, but as I mentioned,
an alt text attribute of

122
00:08:40.917 --> 00:08:45.802
image may include adult female with child,
outdoor scene.

123
00:08:45.802 --> 00:08:49.559
That's better than nothing,
but if it said something like,

124
00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:54.399
a woman carries her daughter on a colorful
autumn walking trail at golden hour,

125
00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.006
which one sounds better?

126
00:08:56.006 --> 00:09:01.981
Personally, I think having more capturing
the essence of what is in a photo.

127
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:05.007
You're thinking about
the person reading it,

128
00:09:05.007 --> 00:09:08.796
not just letting the computer
generate some random stuff.

129
00:09:08.796 --> 00:09:11.213
There are some API's
that you could check out.

130
00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:17.754
There's one called alttext.ai, and
another one called automated-alt-text-api.

131
00:09:17.754 --> 00:09:23.067
I think where those become more relevant
is if you did nothing, it would literally

132
00:09:23.067 --> 00:09:29.013
be hundreds of images with nothing,
like CMSs, user-generated content.

133
00:09:29.013 --> 00:09:32.733
You kind of can't get around it sometimes
that something is better than nothing.

134
00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:36.892
And in that case, here are some
APIs to maybe go down that path and

135
00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:38.293
see if it's viable.

136
00:09:39.623 --> 00:09:42.236
Just know that it's not gonna be the same,
but

137
00:09:42.236 --> 00:09:45.837
we can't have artisan handcrafted
alt text in every case.

138
00:09:45.837 --> 00:09:48.253
So those are some trade-offs
that we have to make.
