1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.656
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So for

2
00:00:00.656 --> 00:00:06.770
this exercise we are going to announce
when we add things to the cart.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.085
So when you click this button,
Add to Cart,

4
00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:15.007
we're going to show a little
badge up here in the cart.

5
00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:18.383
I don't want to move the focus up
there because the person might be,

6
00:00:18.383 --> 00:00:22.486
maybe they want to add two things to the
cart, maybe they wanna do something else.

7
00:00:22.486 --> 00:00:27.571
I guess that's a design consideration of
should we move focus to the cart or not?

8
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:29.981
In this case, I'm gonna say we're not.

9
00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:35.004
And instead, we are going to announce
that there is a live region.

10
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:39.212
Or using a live region we are going to
announce that there's a certain number of

11
00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:39.860
products.

12
00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.511
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So for
this one, let's code it together.

13
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:51.155
Sound good?

14
00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:52.328
And then we'll take a break.

15
00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:59.117
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay, so for
this, we are in the exercise 4.

16
00:00:59.117 --> 00:01:01.821
We have similar to the last exercise,

17
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:07.323
the one we're viewing is the one that
doesn't have this supported in it yet.

18
00:01:08.413 --> 00:01:14.383
So if I click this button,
I don't see anything.

19
00:01:14.383 --> 00:01:17.102
I think my button might
not even be a real button.

20
00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:20.689
But what I want to have happen is
there'll be a little badge that shows up.

21
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.695
So we need some state that is going to
show that number and then we're gonna

22
00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:30.957
write an ARIA live region that will just
announce when that text is appended.

23
00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:35.998
And we can always look at
the more completed example.

24
00:01:35.998 --> 00:01:39.717
So I'm gonna come over here to our code.

25
00:01:39.717 --> 00:01:46.670
That stuff is all, I think for
the most part in the product details.

26
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.962
So our button, I was right,
it is not a real button.

27
00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:53.800
That was something, so
this is interesting.

28
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.857
I don't think axe complained
about this button or

29
00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:00.149
maybe the version of that
page had real buttons in it.

30
00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.526
But these should be buttons, not divs.

31
00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:06.563
I don't think axe will complain at you
if you have a click event on a div,

32
00:02:06.563 --> 00:02:10.132
because there are valid use cases for
click events on divs, but

33
00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:12.379
it's also a big accessibility issue.

34
00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.581
So now this is a real button.

35
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:20.652
It has a click event on it with
a callback function called onAddToCart.

36
00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:25.721
So this product detail page, it knows
which product we're looking at, so

37
00:02:25.721 --> 00:02:30.870
it's gonna pass its product kind of data
object back up to the parent to say,

38
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.312
hey this is the one that we're
gonna pass up to the shopping cart.

39
00:02:35.312 --> 00:02:39.435
Cuz the shopping cart is outside
of the scope of this, so

40
00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:44.259
we have to do a little bit of passing
around of state to show that and

41
00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.560
there's definitely more than
one way you could do this for

42
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.221
this sort of prototyped product page
that's how we're gonna to handle it.

43
00:02:54.221 --> 00:03:02.458
So on Add to Cart, let's go to
trace the trail of where that is.

44
00:03:02.458 --> 00:03:05.351
So, if I go up to the top of the page,

45
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:09.215
product details gets
that callback function.

46
00:03:09.215 --> 00:03:14.436
So product details is added
here in the product page.

47
00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:19.332
So that's where this onAddToCart callback
function, then on the parent side,

48
00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:21.927
I can handle what's in the shopping cart.

49
00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:27.125
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So we have state
tracking the shopping cart items.

50
00:03:27.125 --> 00:03:33.200
We have that callback function that will
say, all right, go add this to our cart.

51
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.619
And I don't think it's actually
doing anything right now.

52
00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:43.025
So what I'm gonna do is make another
function, we'll called onAddToCart.

53
00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:46.111
And I'm gonna update
the state in that function.

54
00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:52.481
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Let's
call it onAddToCart.

55
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:57.417
It's gonna take in a product,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: That

56
00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.447
is going to want a type.

57
00:04:03.395 --> 00:04:05.937
Man.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're missing the arrow

58
00:04:05.937 --> 00:04:07.244
function.

59
00:04:07.244 --> 00:04:08.160
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Yeah, thank you.

60
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.136
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay, so in here
we're gonna say updateShoppingCartItems.

61
00:04:16.136 --> 00:04:22.433
I am going to combine what was
potentially in the shopping cart already.

62
00:04:22.433 --> 00:04:27.027
Like if I was on another product page or
something, I have to, yeah,

63
00:04:27.027 --> 00:04:31.069
this is definitely not a data
architecture course [LAUGH], so

64
00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.022
this is what we're doing right now, okay?

65
00:04:34.022 --> 00:04:37.356
I'm gonna say, we'll say Items,

66
00:04:37.356 --> 00:04:42.255
let's say shoppingCartItems and
the new product.

67
00:04:42.255 --> 00:04:45.762
We're going to combine those
using the spread operator and

68
00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:50.402
then we will update our shopping cart
state with that combined array of items.

69
00:04:50.402 --> 00:04:53.954
So there's an array of objects here.

70
00:04:53.954 --> 00:04:59.017
So on Add to Cart now has updated
those items to do that stuff.

71
00:04:59.017 --> 00:05:02.998
So the shoppingCartItems are actually
already being passed in to our

72
00:05:02.998 --> 00:05:07.125
product header, we just weren't
really doing anything to update it.

73
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:09.747
So I'm gonna save that.

74
00:05:09.747 --> 00:05:16.123
Let's go over to the product header and
our shopping cart icon,

75
00:05:16.123 --> 00:05:21.333
I'm going to maybe collapse
our banner component.

76
00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:22.882
So here's our shopping cart.

77
00:05:24.362 --> 00:05:28.916
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I've
got shoppingCartItems, so

78
00:05:28.916 --> 00:05:33.156
if I have shoppingCartItems and

79
00:05:33.156 --> 00:05:36.610
just to be extra careful,

80
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.419
I'm gonna say if
the length is more than 0,

81
00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.767
then I could output a little badge icon.

82
00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:52.904
So, I think I already have the CSS for
that, and

83
00:05:52.904 --> 00:05:58.954
that will be our little circle
with the number up there.

84
00:05:58.954 --> 00:06:03.646
So just to make sure that I
have the CSS for that in here,

85
00:06:03.646 --> 00:06:07.948
we have a CSS class,
I'm just gonna go and check.

86
00:06:07.948 --> 00:06:09.529
I always confuse these two.

87
00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.682
Okay, custom css.

88
00:06:11.682 --> 00:06:15.395
Okay, so we have a badge here,
it's got a red background color,

89
00:06:15.395 --> 00:06:18.109
it's like a little circle
with some text in it.

90
00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:20.047
So that's in there.

91
00:06:20.047 --> 00:06:22.112
I did bail out of Tailwind for

92
00:06:22.112 --> 00:06:26.687
this example because it was not
working for me for some reason.

93
00:06:26.687 --> 00:06:29.542
So we're getting the job
done with CSS classes.

94
00:06:29.542 --> 00:06:35.608
So we've got a little badge that will
output if there's more than zero items.

95
00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:39.638
It's like that message notification
that won't ever go away otherwise, so

96
00:06:39.638 --> 00:06:42.803
we only want to show it if
there's actually something in it.

97
00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:44.922
So then we need to say,

98
00:06:44.922 --> 00:06:50.513
shoppingCartItems.length that
will show us the number.

99
00:06:50.513 --> 00:06:57.158
And for our live region, we want to
say like, hey, there's items in there.

100
00:06:57.158 --> 00:07:00.719
So we could put our live region
right up here in the header.

101
00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:04.644
If you had live regions throughout your
product or throughout your web app,

102
00:07:04.644 --> 00:07:06.866
you might wanna centralize them somehow.

103
00:07:06.866 --> 00:07:09.478
But for this kinda first iteration,

104
00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:14.458
I'm just gonna create it right here
in the element, or in the header.

105
00:07:14.458 --> 00:07:16.529
So I'm gonna make this a div.

106
00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:22.182
I'm gonna say div role status,
that will create our live region.

107
00:07:22.182 --> 00:07:28.677
I am going to make it visually hidden
with the Tailwind sr-only class.

108
00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:36.540
And let's, we could just say
ShoppingCartItems.length,

109
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:43.204
like there are certain number
of items in your cart.

110
00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:50.985
So, I could say, Let's see,

111
00:07:50.985 --> 00:07:57.663
I actually wanna abstract
this into a state variable.

112
00:07:57.663 --> 00:08:01.499
So I'm gonna say.

113
00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:06.293
Let's see, regionAnnouncement,
or cartAnnouncement,

114
00:08:06.293 --> 00:08:11.275
I think that's what I called it,
cartAnnouncementMessage.

115
00:08:11.275 --> 00:08:13.742
So I'm going to go define that
up here using React state.

116
00:08:13.742 --> 00:08:18.960
I could say cartAnnouncementMessage,

117
00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.719
setCartAnnouncementMessage, and

118
00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:26.793
I'll say = useState.

119
00:08:26.793 --> 00:08:32.525
That will be a string, and
I'll start it off as an empty string.

120
00:08:32.525 --> 00:08:36.249
So the element will be there, but
it won't have any content in it, so

121
00:08:36.249 --> 00:08:37.804
nothing will be read aloud.

122
00:08:37.804 --> 00:08:41.424
And then when we get
shoppingCartItems I can do things,

123
00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:44.281
like manipulate what that text looks like.

124
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:47.930
I can say, does it have item or
items in it?

125
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:50.224
I could have done that in line in the JSX,

126
00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:54.218
it just felt like a little too much
logic to put down there in my markup.

127
00:08:54.218 --> 00:08:57.432
So I'm gonna do, I guess,
pick your poison, right?

128
00:08:57.432 --> 00:08:59.406
I'm gonna do useEffect instead.

129
00:08:59.406 --> 00:09:03.447
So when we get that code
CartAnnouncementMessage or sorry,

130
00:09:03.447 --> 00:09:07.568
the shoppingCartItems,
I'm going to create a side effect of

131
00:09:07.568 --> 00:09:10.831
generating a live region
announcement from it.

132
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:15.743
So, in my dependency array,
I'm gonna say shoppingCartItems,

133
00:09:15.743 --> 00:09:18.471
so this way I can safely manipulate.

134
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:23.528
I can take that data,
manipulate it into the string I want and

135
00:09:23.528 --> 00:09:27.106
I can call setCartAnnouncementMessage.

136
00:09:27.106 --> 00:09:31.350
It will then create this other
state variable that I need to use.

137
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.724
So let's say, so item or items,

138
00:09:34.724 --> 00:09:39.917
gosh naming things is always the hardest,
right?

139
00:09:39.917 --> 00:09:44.205
So,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So

140
00:09:44.205 --> 00:09:49.642
if shoppingCartItems.length,
if it equals 1, I could say,

141
00:09:49.642 --> 00:09:55.397
you have one item in your cart,
[LAUGH] otherwise, it'll be items.

142
00:09:55.397 --> 00:09:58.141
If it's zero items,
we aren't gonna see it.

143
00:09:58.141 --> 00:10:02.379
But if it's two or more, we'll see items.

144
00:10:02.379 --> 00:10:07.292
So then,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Get my ternary

145
00:10:07.292 --> 00:10:08.591
operator here.

146
00:10:08.591 --> 00:10:14.236
So I could say,
setCartAnnouncementMessage,

147
00:10:14.236 --> 00:10:19.605
I'm going to make a template literal and
say,

148
00:10:19.605 --> 00:10:26.924
There are shoppingCartItems.length,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: And

149
00:10:26.924 --> 00:10:32.553
then are item or items in your cart.

150
00:10:32.553 --> 00:10:36.450
So that should be, there
are the number of items in your cart.

151
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.893
I could wrap this in logic if I really
wanted to be extra safe by saying,

152
00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:48.314
if shoppingCartItems,
probably don't need to do that.

153
00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:55.024
But if the length is greater than 0,
then run this code.

154
00:10:55.024 --> 00:10:56.027
I don't think it'll matter.

155
00:10:56.027 --> 00:11:02.982
But if you wanna be extra type safe or
something, that should give us a string.

156
00:11:02.982 --> 00:11:06.317
Let's go see what what happened.

157
00:11:06.317 --> 00:11:13.066
So, we will add to the cart,
shopping cart items is not alterable.

158
00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:14.790
I saw this before.

159
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:20.618
So I think my type script,
any, there it is.

160
00:11:20.618 --> 00:11:27.659
So this actually should be product, that's
a type that this file doesn't know about.

161
00:11:27.659 --> 00:11:28.904
So I'm gonna go import the type.

162
00:11:33.119 --> 00:11:38.479
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Product from,
where are those types?

163
00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:41.902
Types,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay,

164
00:11:41.902 --> 00:11:44.182
seems to be cool with that.

165
00:11:44.182 --> 00:11:49.354
Okay, so now, it should be an inerrable.

166
00:11:49.354 --> 00:11:55.934
I thought it would be before,
but it was mad, big mad.

167
00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:58.202
Still not, okay.

168
00:11:58.202 --> 00:12:02.417
So, for time purposes, yes.

169
00:12:02.417 --> 00:12:06.069
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was gonna say I think I
know the problem like further upstream and

170
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:09.805
the parent component,
I think the state was initialized as null.

171
00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.849
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay.

172
00:12:12.849 --> 00:12:17.051
Yes, it was and it's an any here too.

173
00:12:17.051 --> 00:12:20.965
So product,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Yeah,

174
00:12:20.965 --> 00:12:26.026
it's an array of products and
I can initialize it as an empty array.

175
00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:26.651
Thank you.

176
00:12:29.374 --> 00:12:32.767
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Save
us a little bit of time.

177
00:12:32.767 --> 00:12:34.827
Now, it is mad.

178
00:12:34.827 --> 00:12:42.574
If shoppingCartItems,
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: And,

179
00:12:42.574 --> 00:12:48.136
it's interesting that it complained
in the browser but not in line.

180
00:12:50.546 --> 00:12:51.995
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay,
let's see if that worked.

181
00:12:53.955 --> 00:12:58.359
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: No, okay, fun,
it's only mad when I click that button.

182
00:12:58.359 --> 00:13:04.931
So I'm gonna open the full
page in another tab.

183
00:13:06.935 --> 00:13:07.834
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That one worked.

184
00:13:07.834 --> 00:13:09.680
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Okay,
so we have the badge there.

185
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.571
I'm not really sure what's going on,
but we'll figure it out.

186
00:13:12.571 --> 00:13:14.674
Okay, so we have a badge.

187
00:13:14.674 --> 00:13:16.299
Woohoo, it worked.

188
00:13:16.299 --> 00:13:18.793
But what did that live region do?

189
00:13:18.793 --> 00:13:23.266
That's the bigger question because
that's what we're really focused on,

190
00:13:23.266 --> 00:13:25.879
it kind of motivated
the thought process of,

191
00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:29.267
I click here,
something else is happening on the screen.

192
00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:33.524
So, we're going to fire up VoiceOver and
see if it worked.

193
00:13:33.524 --> 00:13:36.525
So, function command F5.

194
00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:39.401
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Announcements, banner,
announcements, list two items, link,

195
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:41.940
clear gifts for everyone on your list,
shop our gift guide.

196
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.002
Next slide.
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: We're gonna

197
00:13:43.002 --> 00:13:44.079
fix that carousel next.

198
00:13:44.079 --> 00:13:45.155
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Button, banner.

199
00:13:45.155 --> 00:13:45.770
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Next exercise.

200
00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.013
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You
are currently on a button.

201
00:13:47.013 --> 00:13:48.436
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Actually-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: To click this button,

202
00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:51.511
press add to cart, button, main,
two items in your shopping card.

203
00:13:51.511 --> 00:13:55.005
You are currently on a button to click
this button, press control, option,

204
00:13:55.005 --> 00:13:57.010
space, three items in your shopping cart.

205
00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.212
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So see how it waited
until everything else was done reading?

206
00:14:02.212 --> 00:14:08.648
Might be fine, I mean, that's really, you
start to get into user research territory.

207
00:14:10.212 --> 00:14:13.031
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I think it's
probably fine to just leave it that way.

208
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:18.262
But if you're working on
a design system or something,

209
00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:24.844
some of these patterns would really
benefit from testing with users.

210
00:14:24.844 --> 00:14:29.749
And these are compound components,
so some of these flows and patterns,

211
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:33.148
we can make a best guess,
but I just wanna say like,

212
00:14:33.148 --> 00:14:36.809
I'm bringing my own developer
bias to this solution.

213
00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:42.266
So ask people, even if you can just,
I don't know, pay somebody to consult for

214
00:14:42.266 --> 00:14:46.675
an hour to explain the thing they
might even give you some ideas.

215
00:14:46.675 --> 00:14:50.320
But, so yeah, it worked though.

216
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.564
We've got three items in our shopping cart
and I'm still in my navigating, going

217
00:14:55.564 --> 00:15:00.742
through the page my focus is still on the
button so that's how live regions work.

218
00:15:00.742 --> 00:15:03.490
They're really awesome.

219
00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:05.658
Let's see what it looks like- [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: If we make it

220
00:15:05.658 --> 00:15:10.524
assertive since we're talking
about whether to interrupt or not,

221
00:15:10.524 --> 00:15:11.817
let's try that.

222
00:15:11.817 --> 00:15:15.658
So in this solution we
have rule of status.

223
00:15:15.658 --> 00:15:21.376
If I say rule of alert
that will interrupt.

224
00:15:23.558 --> 00:15:26.232
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I'm very curious
what I messed up on that other page.

225
00:15:26.232 --> 00:15:29.452
So let's fire VoiceOver back up.

226
00:15:29.452 --> 00:15:31.522
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Announcements,
banner, announcements.

227
00:15:31.522 --> 00:15:34.676
List two items, link, clear gifts for
everyone on your list, shop,

228
00:15:34.676 --> 00:15:37.573
add to cart, button, main,
four items in your shopping cart.

229
00:15:37.573 --> 00:15:40.092
You are currently on a button,
to click this button.

230
00:15:40.092 --> 00:15:43.350
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So,
assertive might be better, I'm not sure.

231
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.681
Did you hear the little [SOUND]?

232
00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:46.879
It makes a little interrupt noise.

233
00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:50.448
So I guess to get back to that question
on whether you should play a noise,

234
00:15:50.448 --> 00:15:53.271
there already is a noise [LAUGH] for
the assertive alerts.

235
00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:56.542
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Yeah,
sort of might be okay.

236
00:15:56.542 --> 00:15:59.422
I guess you have to think about
what other announcements could.

237
00:15:59.422 --> 00:16:03.772
Possibly be running, it could be okay,
it could be annoying.

238
00:16:03.772 --> 00:16:05.510
I'm not really sure.

239
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.633
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Six items
in your shopping cart.

240
00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:12.505
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: But I think for
this type of thing, I guess assertive

241
00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:17.603
when I think through the kind
of user impact of it.

242
00:16:17.603 --> 00:16:20.378
You wanna make sure that
the button worked, and if,

243
00:16:20.378 --> 00:16:24.605
I think assertive actually might, now
that I'm just kind of talking out loud,

244
00:16:24.605 --> 00:16:26.708
I think that might be the right choice.

245
00:16:26.708 --> 00:16:32.690
Because the consequence is that if you
don't immediately know that it worked,

246
00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.665
you might keep clicking.

247
00:16:34.665 --> 00:16:36.357
And then as a blind screen reader user,

248
00:16:36.357 --> 00:16:38.216
then how do you go remove
it from your card?

249
00:16:38.216 --> 00:16:42.442
Then that's a whole other can of worms,
then you have to go to another page,

250
00:16:42.442 --> 00:16:47.612
you have to do all the stuff, so I think
assertive is my that's my final answer.

251
00:16:47.612 --> 00:16:48.425
Was there a question?

252
00:16:50.597 --> 00:16:54.035
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it make
sense to set roll alert for

253
00:16:54.035 --> 00:16:59.629
any kind of error notifications
that could pop up on the site?

254
00:16:59.629 --> 00:17:06.206
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Potentially,
so this is an area we wanna,

255
00:17:06.206 --> 00:17:10.237
definitely verify that.

256
00:17:10.237 --> 00:17:13.705
Anytime we're talking about live regions,
I'm just like,

257
00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:17.183
hold the phone [LAUGH] Because
we wanna be, careful with them.

258
00:17:17.183 --> 00:17:22.490
As I mentioned, they can be super
annoying, like screen reader users,

259
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:26.985
and many people will say
that they're annoying.

260
00:17:26.985 --> 00:17:30.250
So I think for error validation,

261
00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:35.389
like form validation I do
think it's appropriate.

262
00:17:35.389 --> 00:17:40.849
You can use ARIA invalid for actual form
validation and send focused to the errors,

263
00:17:40.849 --> 00:17:45.685
like say in a form context, there's
some form fields that you missed, or

264
00:17:45.685 --> 00:17:48.582
aren't filled in correctly or something.

265
00:17:48.582 --> 00:17:52.046
And with client-side validation,
when you hit submit,

266
00:17:52.046 --> 00:17:55.100
you're doing the action
of clicking a button.

267
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:59.870
So it's appropriate to move focus to
the first error message, I think.

268
00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:03.770
So, live region may or
may not be that useful in that context.

269
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.840
Where they are useful is where
you are not going to move focus.

270
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:12.128
If you did have some sort of an alert
error banner at the top, I guess I just

271
00:18:12.128 --> 00:18:18.620
said the word alert, that does kind of
sound like an RA live -region situation.

272
00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.966
I think where we wanna get careful Is so

273
00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:25.001
that it's not repeatedly announcing
[LAUGH] the ten minutes ago,

274
00:18:25.001 --> 00:18:30.110
five minutes ago, error, error, error,
sounds annoying because it would be.

275
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:34.872
So we wanna be careful that
we're not just making annoying

276
00:18:34.872 --> 00:18:40.135
announcements that we don't
realize are pummeling our users.

277
00:18:40.135 --> 00:18:43.768
Coz if you don't have the screen reader
running, you probably have no idea.

278
00:18:43.768 --> 00:18:48.141
So if it's re-rendering, like,
automatically or something,

279
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:50.805
that's what we wanna be careful about.

280
00:18:50.805 --> 00:18:54.030
I saw one technique for
live regions that makes me think of,

281
00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:55.652
I think this was pre-React.

282
00:18:55.652 --> 00:19:00.151
But their solution to client-side
routing and screen reader announcements,

283
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:04.175
was to wrap the main content in a live
region, so anytime that updated,

284
00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:05.737
it would just announce it.

285
00:19:06.937 --> 00:19:12.455
Seemed kind of innovative at the time,
but now that I'm thinking about,

286
00:19:12.455 --> 00:19:16.994
like, I just worked on a page
that had like a, some sort of a,

287
00:19:16.994 --> 00:19:21.560
use effect, run amok, and
it was just like re-rendering.

288
00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.289
And the only way I knew was that
the console was just like adding, adding,

289
00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.800
adding, adding the terminal was spinning.

290
00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:30.259
I think that page would be re-rendering,
so

291
00:19:30.259 --> 00:19:34.060
if it had a live region on it would
just be constantly announcing.

292
00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:39.481
So I mean, that's a like deeper bug
than just the live region, but it might

293
00:19:39.481 --> 00:19:45.348
kind of illustrate, when it's re rendering
the screen reader might pick it up.

294
00:19:45.348 --> 00:19:47.214
I don't know you have to test it,

295
00:19:47.214 --> 00:19:51.222
coz there are some other settings
that we didn't actually talk about.

296
00:19:51.222 --> 00:19:56.033
If I go back to live regions there are,
do I have it in here?

297
00:19:56.033 --> 00:19:59.034
Yes ARIA atomic and ARIA irrelevant,

298
00:19:59.034 --> 00:20:04.195
theoretically will change whether
it will announce additions or

299
00:20:04.195 --> 00:20:09.097
removals like what kind of,
how granular is the live region.

300
00:20:09.097 --> 00:20:12.630
It hasn't been super
reliable cross-platform but

301
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:17.285
hopefully with a live region if it
literally is announcing the same or

302
00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:20.753
re-rendering the same thing over and
over again.

303
00:20:20.753 --> 00:20:24.187
It shouldn't just announce it over and
over but,

304
00:20:24.187 --> 00:20:29.268
again it's like this is an area that
we do wanna test in a screen reader.

305
00:20:29.268 --> 00:20:32.634
So hopefully,
you see some motivation to add that in

306
00:20:32.634 --> 00:20:36.588
your workflow if you have a use case for
live regions.

307
00:20:36.588 --> 00:20:41.278
I do wanna see if I can
fix our TypeScript error.

308
00:20:41.278 --> 00:20:45.920
So that one was in product header,

309
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.676
what I'm gonna do is
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone said,

310
00:20:49.676 --> 00:20:53.438
I think it might have to do with
the default value, maybe null.

311
00:20:53.438 --> 00:20:55.258
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Yes we changed that,
I thought.

312
00:20:55.258 --> 00:20:56.794
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, sorry.

313
00:20:56.794 --> 00:21:01.368
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So
shoppingCartItems, we have an array,

314
00:21:01.368 --> 00:21:03.532
array of products.

315
00:21:07.902 --> 00:21:11.041
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: We
have shoppingCart, wait,

316
00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:14.548
maybe I didn't update that page.

317
00:21:14.548 --> 00:21:17.210
I think I might have fixed the wrong one.

318
00:21:19.572 --> 00:21:23.476
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: Maybe that was it,
I swear I edited that in the right place.

319
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:27.906
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I remember doing it,

320
00:21:27.906 --> 00:21:31.193
that's the problem of having
multiple versions of the same thing.

321
00:21:31.193 --> 00:21:33.222
Well, it worked, but my styling is off.

322
00:21:33.222 --> 00:21:34.546
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: I'm gonna

323
00:21:34.546 --> 00:21:36.252
call that a win [LAUGH].

324
00:21:36.252 --> 00:21:38.187
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Marcy Sutton Todd: So yes,

325
00:21:38.187 --> 00:21:42.010
demo inside of another React,

326
00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:47.901
the rest of the React site,
so, some styling.

327
00:21:47.901 --> 00:21:52.185
But at least the bones are there,
the functionality works.

328
00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:56.905
And the live region should announce there,
so one thing I didn't show you is

329
00:21:56.905 --> 00:22:01.126
that you can inspect just like any
other element with a live region.

330
00:22:01.126 --> 00:22:06.590
So I guess it would be up here in
the header just to make sure it rendered,

331
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.963
like sometimes we're using react where you

332
00:22:09.963 --> 00:22:14.172
only output an element if
a certain condition is true.

333
00:22:15.192 --> 00:22:17.992
Sometimes you'll be like, well,
why didn't that element render?

334
00:22:17.992 --> 00:22:22.322
It could be something with your
state variables or something, so

335
00:22:22.322 --> 00:22:26.981
you can always go to the dev tools and
see like, it's not announcing.

336
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:28.683
Is that for some other reason or

337
00:22:28.683 --> 00:22:33.281
is it because my live region didn't
actually end up in the rendered document?

338
00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:37.359
So it's there, if it doesn't announce,
even though you see it in there,

339
00:22:37.359 --> 00:22:39.879
it might be for some other reason.

340
00:22:39.879 --> 00:22:42.495
Like maybe display none, or I'm not sure,

341
00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:47.388
maybe the maybe the messages aren't making
it to the right element or something.
