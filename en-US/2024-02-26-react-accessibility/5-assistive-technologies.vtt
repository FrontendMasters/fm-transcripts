1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.997
Let's move on.
We're gonna talk just briefly about other

2
00:00:02.997 --> 00:00:06.797
assistive technologies and then we're
gonna fire up a screen reader and

3
00:00:06.797 --> 00:00:07.739
do some testing.

4
00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:11.422
So there are other types of
assistive technologies and

5
00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:14.555
other content types that
I wanted to mention.

6
00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:18.682
So, I mean,
even a simple things like eyeglasses and

7
00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:22.914
wheelchairs could be
considered assistive devices.

8
00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:25.599
But as I mentioned,
there's braille displays.

9
00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.147
If you're curious about those,

10
00:00:28.147 --> 00:00:33.981
I have a link in here about how braille
displays help users navigate the web.

11
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.731
There's speech recognition and
voice control,

12
00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:39.357
using things like
Dragon Naturally Speaking.

13
00:00:39.357 --> 00:00:43.719
Tthere's also voice control for
iOS and macOS.

14
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.855
And I have a link in here from my buddy,

15
00:00:46.855 --> 00:00:51.177
this guy named Ian Mackay,
who's a quadriplegic.

16
00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:55.876
He's up in Washington where I live,
and he does a lot of work with

17
00:00:55.876 --> 00:01:00.935
Apple to improve their software for
paraplegics, quadriplegics.

18
00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:04.056
And so in this video that I've included,

19
00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:10.139
he talks about Apple accessibility,
his work with them and how he uses it.

20
00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:13.028
And so, yeah, he powers his wheelchair,

21
00:01:13.028 --> 00:01:16.577
he's got a smart home that he uses,
voice control.

22
00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:22.744
So he's a real ambassador for
using technology, it's changed his life.

23
00:01:22.744 --> 00:01:24.067
He's super awesome.

24
00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:29.415
So yeah, once you learn how people use
technology, it becomes less of a mystery.

25
00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:33.613
It's like, well, yeah, of course,
we have to make it accessible,

26
00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:35.157
cuz then Ian can't use it.

27
00:01:35.157 --> 00:01:38.410
These are real people.

28
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.471
So switch devices are another way that
people navigate either a mobile device or

29
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.474
a computer.

30
00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:48.576
So you can have a limited number of keys.

31
00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:53.001
And there's a video in here
from Rob Dodson on A11ycasts,

32
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.709
he talks more about switch devices.

33
00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.319
Screen magnification,
as you mentioned earlier,

34
00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.346
you had to fire it up yesterday
to deal with a vision issue.

35
00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:05.492
And so that's there all the time.

36
00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:10.031
We have screen magnification and
zoom built into our platforms.

37
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.311
There's also third party software
with things like zoom text.

38
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:19.839
And just to sort of make sure we cover
this, just somewhere in the workshop,

39
00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.605
I wanted to mention transcripts and
closed captions cuz those are so

40
00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:29.386
critical for people who are deaf or
hard of hearing to follow along.

41
00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:33.366
Sort of a different approach,
but both transcripts and

42
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:38.372
close captions are critical anytime
you have audio or media content.

43
00:02:38.372 --> 00:02:42.482
And then audio descriptions,
which are a little more related to

44
00:02:42.482 --> 00:02:47.645
people who use screen readers, but
it's like alternative text for video.

45
00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:52.342
And so if you watch Netflix or Hulu or
something, when you watch a show,

46
00:02:52.342 --> 00:02:56.040
there are nonverbal things
that happen in those shows.

47
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.629
That if they could be described with
audio descriptions, you turn it on or

48
00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.589
play an audio described
version of a video, and

49
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:07.377
it will read all of that stuff
aloud along with the dialogue.
