[00:00:00]
>> So setting the language and fixing markup. So one easy win that you can do on a lot of web pages, and this is something that Ax will advise you to do, is to put a language on your pages. So if there's one overall language, English, for example, we can put html Lang = en for English.

[00:00:23]
And that will actually have a pretty profound effect on assistive technology. So depending on how the content is, what language it's in, the screen reader will change its pronunciation and it's really cool. So for sites with multiple languages, maybe you could change it in a template, depending on what language you're rendering out.

[00:00:43]
There is page-level versus element-level language. So if you have a site that's mostly in English, but you have some elements on it that are in French or some other language, you can actually kind of override the page-level language on a per element basis. So if I have a paragraph with Lang = fr within a Lang = en, that one paragraph will sound [FOREIGN].

[00:01:13]
[LAUGH] It will sound different, and you can hear it in the screen reader. It's pretty awesome. So if you had a whole page of French and it was marked up as Lang = en, it would be excruciating [LAUGH] to try and listen to. It would be the worst pronunciation ever.

[00:01:28]
But actually, the screen reader can do a way better job if you tell it what language it needs to be in. I think we even have an example. So I have a stack blitz here in the project that we can actually fire up and test. So let's try that real quick.

[00:01:46]
I am going to put it on preview mode. So StackBlitz itself is probably not that accessible. A lot of these tools, I want them to be more accessible. But often when you're testing, if you can open the little demo project in a new window, sometimes that'll isolate it so that the screen reader doesn't get tripped up on other UI elements of the tool itself.

[00:02:10]
So I'm gonna turn on voiceover with function command F5.
>> Navigation, visited link, heading level one, web accessibility, v3 home frame preview page, group.
>> So you can get into it.
>> You are currently on a frame to an https://webdashflat. https://web-dashplatform-li6gwd, heading level 2, Boef Bourgignon, heading level 1, French Recipes, heading level 2, Boef Bourgignon.

[00:02:39]
You are currently on the heading level 2 [CROSSTALK].
>> That didn't work did it [LAUGH]?
>> [FOREIGN] So that's what it sounds like when it doesn't work. [LAUGH] That was so terrible, jet hub anyone?
>> VoiceOver off.
>> Yeah, that didn't work at all. So that could be Chrome.

[00:02:57]
It totally worked when I tested it, so it does have the Lang fr, that could be reason enough to open this up in Safari. So because I am committed to this I'm going to go open it up and see. We'll see maybe our first difference, if StackBlitz will load.

[00:03:17]
It will, okay, so I'm gonna fire it up again, function command F5.
>> Voiceover on Safari, set recipes, you are current, heading level 1, heading level 2, Boeuf Bourguignon.
>> Nope.
>> You are current, heading level 1, French Recipes. You are heading level 2, Boeuf Bourguignon.
>> That's so terrible.

[00:03:33]

>> You are currently on the heading level 2 inside of the frame. Character palette, close button Safari, setting a language and fixed voice over off.
>> Sad face emoji. Well, the demo gods were not blessing us [LAUGH] in this example and I have no idea why, maybe it's something with StackBlitz.

[00:03:50]
I think when I tested it, it was not embedded within the slide window itself, so we have to test stuff periodically, and I swear Voiceover will do that sometimes where you're, wait, that worked and then it didn't. But we're embedding windows within windows so all bets are off if it'll be beef bojignon or boeuf bourguignon.

[00:04:14]
That's pretty funny, [LAUGH] At least you can see the kind of what happens when you don't have the attribute so it's informative in that way. Fun [LAUGH], okay, well, I'm going to close out of Safari. That was a fun little experiment.
>> I often find engineers use the button tag for a link usually because they need an on click handler for something like analytics.

[00:04:42]
For example, pushing to the route in a function when the next router, instead of using an actual link. What would be the best way to correctly handle this so that a link is a link, but it also calls a function?
>> Well, I think, yeah, it's gonna depend on your router, for one.

[00:05:01]
I haven't had to use a router in a little while, and you'll learn why, [LAUGH] this week for sure. But I think if, I've seen a lot of buttons that should be links in the code base I'm working on. And I think sometimes styles are the constraint. If you're dealing with old styles that everyone's afraid to touch, that can be a reason why the stuff persists.

[00:05:28]
So to try and solve that, yeah, I guess I'd have to see, can you put maybe an event listener on the element and the h or f for the link. That's just kind of talking you through my process of what I would try, is to see if you can register a click event that doesn't do any navigating but will kind of capture that analytics event, especially if it's client side routed.

[00:05:57]
I guess one thing I would be looking out for is if the default html navigation with href, if it wasn't client-side routed, it would probably refresh and you may or may not see that click event to capture that analytics event. But if it is client-side routed, it's not gonna refresh the page.

[00:06:19]
So theoretically, maybe you could do a click event and an href, but I'm not totally certain that would work. That's kinda just my thought process, cuz often there are constraints like that, and we're like, why does this happen this way? It's not by choice. It's just because of whatever we're trying to navigate through at work.

[00:06:42]
So I think in an ideal world, we do want to try and make links look like links and buttons look like buttons, but I can say from experience that that's just not always what happens.
