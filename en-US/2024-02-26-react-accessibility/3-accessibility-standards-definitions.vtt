1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.497
So some standards and definitions
before we dive into screen readers.

2
00:00:04.497 --> 00:00:07.161
So, accessibility isn't just a feeling,

3
00:00:07.161 --> 00:00:11.220
there are standards and
guidelines that we can benefit from.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.405
And they're really a starting point, but
they are very important in the world of

5
00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:21.972
accessibility, starting with WCAG, or
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines,

6
00:00:21.972 --> 00:00:26.259
they are a standard set of criteria for
measuring accessibility.

7
00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.575
Some of these rules can be automated,
which we'll see today, but

8
00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:33.629
a lot of them require human review.

9
00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:40.323
So, the current version of WCAG is 2.2,
there is a looming version

10
00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:45.683
3.0 that aims to kind of
revolutionize how WCAG is structured,

11
00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:51.382
how it works, it is very far out
on the horizon, I would say.

12
00:00:51.382 --> 00:00:56.222
There isn't a lot of consensus among
people that it's anywhere near ready, so

13
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.027
focus on 2.2, [LAUGH], and

14
00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:02.595
I think the most important aspect of
WCA of that is the color contrast part.

15
00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:07.819
I think people are very excited about a
new algorithm for color contrast testing,

16
00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:12.662
but we're still on 2.2, so that's
the standard you should aim for, and

17
00:01:12.662 --> 00:01:15.980
it's backwards compatible for
the most part.

18
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.488
One really cool thing about WCAG is that
it's developed in the open on GitHub, so

19
00:01:20.488 --> 00:01:23.870
you can go and read how people
are making decisions about it,

20
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.175
what research has gone into it.

21
00:01:26.175 --> 00:01:30.585
You could go and ask a question if
you didn't understand something.

22
00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:34.580
I mean, just to have it developed
in the open is really incredible,

23
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.559
and so that's a resource that I reference
quite often when I'm trying to understand

24
00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:40.909
a certain criterion.

25
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:47.819
So, another acronym, this one we will
cover much more fully today is ARIA,

26
00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.819
stands for
Accessible Rich Internet Applications.

27
00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.811
And this is a specification that includes
a standard set of role states and

28
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:02.661
properties that plum accessibility
information through your web pages.

29
00:02:02.661 --> 00:02:05.941
So, these are actual attributes that
you would put into your markup.

30
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:10.798
It's a bit more of an advanced tool,
I would say, so

31
00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:15.795
it's not the first thing you should reach
for, but there are some concepts that do

32
00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:19.368
apply to base HTML that we will
definitely get into [LAUGH].

33
00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:24.995
The current version of ARIA is 1.2, and it
is also developed in the open on GitHub.

34
00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:30.618
So, this one I would definitely say I
have open in a tab quite often to go and

35
00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:34.985
read up on what's going on
with this one attribute.

36
00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:39.535
You might even be able to learn about
browser support or assistive technology

37
00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:44.296
support for a certain thing, yeah,
it's really, really cool to be on GitHub.

38
00:02:46.196 --> 00:02:51.787
There are other similar documents from the
W3C who puts out ARIA and WCAG, there's

39
00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:57.746
one called ARIA in HTML, and another one
called Using ARIA that are pretty great.

40
00:02:57.746 --> 00:03:00.740
These are more informational
documents where

41
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.267
the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
is what we call normative,

42
00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:09.718
that means that it's clear requirements,
whereas some things that

43
00:03:09.718 --> 00:03:15.016
are non-normative mean that they're
informational, like tutorials.

44
00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:19.196
That's not something that you
would point to in a court setting.

45
00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:24.387
Whereas WCAG, which is codified into a lot
of laws is normative it is something

46
00:03:24.387 --> 00:03:29.200
that is like legally required when
you're in that type of environment.

47
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.482
So these terms and these standards when
I got into accessibility, they were

48
00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:41.247
all Greek to me, I just didn't understand
what the point was, what these were.

49
00:03:41.247 --> 00:03:46.808
And I just wanna expose you to them if
they're new and just let them soak in,

50
00:03:46.808 --> 00:03:52.267
but it's not stuff you necessarily
need to understand right now.

51
00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:54.014
Just know that these things exist,

52
00:03:54.014 --> 00:03:57.357
you can always reference this
information later as well.

53
00:03:57.357 --> 00:04:02.840
We do have one more bullet point here,
it's a bit of a just fun tip, is that

54
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.588
A11Y is a numeronym, it is a word where
you take the letters in the middle and

55
00:04:08.588 --> 00:04:14.527
replace them with numbers, so A11Y,
there are 11 letters between A and Y.

56
00:04:16.407 --> 00:04:20.452
There's another numeronym
internationalization or, I18N,

57
00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:22.393
there's a number of those.

58
00:04:22.393 --> 00:04:27.388
Ironically, people in accessibility and
outside of it don't think that it's

59
00:04:27.388 --> 00:04:31.859
a very accessible term, But
it's something that we use nonetheless,

60
00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:36.627
especially in Twitter historically,
I mean, if you have to type it a lot and

61
00:04:36.627 --> 00:04:40.601
you're short on characters,
it's pretty easy to reach for.

62
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:46.012
I mostly mention it just so that you know
what it is, you know what it stands for.

63
00:04:46.012 --> 00:04:51.786
You don't have to use it, just yeah,
kind of some fun accessibility trivia.
