1
00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:03.760
ARIA, like all this really cool
stuff with labeling and rolls,

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.324
there's another big topic within it that
I think is some of the coolest parts of

3
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:11.244
ARIA, and
that's what's called Live Regions.

4
00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:16.732
So Live Regions are made so
that screen reader users can be informed

5
00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:23.200
that things are happening on the screen
without moving their keyboard focus.

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.576
Imagine you're typing in a form text area,
and it auto saves, and

7
00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:32.424
there's a toast notification that
when you pause that says, saved, and

8
00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:36.426
you're like, cool, okay,
I can kinda relax a little bit.

9
00:00:36.426 --> 00:00:41.159
I'm not gonna lose this opus that
I'm writing if something happens,

10
00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:42.531
my page refreshes.

11
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:46.893
If you can't see that toast,
it's elsewhere on the screen, and

12
00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:51.019
we don't wanna move the user's
focus cuz they're flowing,

13
00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.130
we don't wanna disrupt
the writing process.

14
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.805
How is a screen reader user going to
know that there was a notification?

15
00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:02.702
Well, there's a thing called Live Regions
that make it really easy to just

16
00:01:02.702 --> 00:01:07.146
pipe a message to the screen reader
without moving the focus at all.

17
00:01:07.146 --> 00:01:11.532
So there's a few different ways
that we can set these up, and

18
00:01:11.532 --> 00:01:15.919
these Live Regions are helpful
in many different contexts.

19
00:01:15.919 --> 00:01:20.566
Including client-side routing,
which we will also talk about, and

20
00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:25.856
enterprise accessibility, but we can
set Live Regions with two major levels.

21
00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:28.880
So there's assertive and polite.

22
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.231
I think assertive maybe even
was called rude, at one time,

23
00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:34.789
because it will interrupt everything else.

24
00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.205
So if you have other announcements,
polite will wait and

25
00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:42.627
kind of slot into the queue of
announcements until other things are done.

26
00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:47.888
Which for a lot of things, is appropriate,
but for things that are time sensitive,

27
00:01:47.888 --> 00:01:51.075
like you are going to be
logged out automatically,

28
00:01:51.075 --> 00:01:53.764
or alert, I guess alert would move focus.

29
00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:58.456
But we sometimes need different
settings for different things.

30
00:01:58.456 --> 00:02:00.657
So assertive and polite.

31
00:02:00.657 --> 00:02:04.194
So there's different
ways to set Live Regions.

32
00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:09.260
There's a role of status,
a role of log, a role of alert.

33
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.685
Those are all the more polite,
chill versions of this.

34
00:02:13.685 --> 00:02:17.408
The more interrupty ones are, I guess,

35
00:02:17.408 --> 00:02:21.908
role alert will interrupt,
and the assertive.

36
00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.105
So there's roles and aria-live attributes.

37
00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:27.603
aria-live-polite is similar
to role-status, role-log.

38
00:02:27.603 --> 00:02:32.308
aria-live assertive is the same
level as the alert, the assertive.

39
00:02:32.308 --> 00:02:34.043
So those will interrupt.

40
00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:35.606
And these act as a message center.

41
00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:40.118
So any element that has these roles or
aria-lives on them,

42
00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:45.546
if you append any text to that element,
it will automatically read it.

43
00:02:45.546 --> 00:02:50.158
And we're gonna go add
one to our product page.

44
00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:54.238
So you can put a CSS class on these so
that they are rendered and

45
00:02:54.238 --> 00:02:57.368
they are read aloud,
but you don't see them.

46
00:02:57.368 --> 00:03:01.612
So the screen reader only class or
visually hidden class,

47
00:03:01.612 --> 00:03:03.948
kind of a best practice to like,

48
00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:09.165
these aren't usually visual content,
they're for screen readers.

49
00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:13.250
So to test them, the only real way
to test this is in a screen reader.

50
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.786
So here's one case.

51
00:03:14.786 --> 00:03:17.976
We had some questions, understandably,

52
00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:21.616
about how often do I need
to test screen readers?

53
00:03:21.616 --> 00:03:25.530
If you're writing a Live Region,
you kind of have to go,

54
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.888
otherwise you're never
gonna hear the output.

55
00:03:28.888 --> 00:03:31.609
So that is one type of use case or

56
00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:36.652
feature that you will be firing
up the screen reader for.

57
00:03:36.652 --> 00:03:42.006
But a lot of the times, I think testing
it in VoiceOver seems to be sufficient,

58
00:03:42.006 --> 00:03:46.155
yeah, if you can test it on Windows,
that would be helpful.

59
00:03:46.155 --> 00:03:50.810
So there was a question around
this topic that I saw about,

60
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.949
can you play a sound with a Live Region?

61
00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:59.477
I think potentially you could,
but I don't think you'd want to.

62
00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:03.913
I think the sound could interfere with
the text content since there's an order.

63
00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:07.871
I mean, talk about you have to
either interrupt other texts or

64
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:09.479
it has to wait in a queue.

65
00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:14.663
So I don't think you'd wanna
interrupt anything with a sound.

66
00:04:14.663 --> 00:04:19.255
I guess if that was a really
compelling idea for your product,

67
00:04:19.255 --> 00:04:21.032
go test it with people.

68
00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:23.918
Create a prototype,
see if it'll work, for one,

69
00:04:23.918 --> 00:04:27.289
see if it annoys the heck out
of people like I think it would.

70
00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:35.261
[LAUGH] So the big cautionary note
with Live Regions is don't overdo it.

71
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.644
If divs are annoying,
Live Regions can be really,

72
00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:41.168
really annoying cuz they talk at you.

73
00:04:41.168 --> 00:04:45.878
And my favorite anecdote of Live Regions
is that there was a chat widget on a major

74
00:04:45.878 --> 00:04:50.519
social media site that there could be
multiple instances of the chat widget and

75
00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:53.424
it was just automatically
announcing the time.

76
00:04:53.424 --> 00:04:56.687
5 minutes ago, 10 minutes ago,
30 minutes ago.

77
00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:57.978
Where's that coming from?

78
00:04:57.978 --> 00:04:59.057
It's from the chat widgets.

79
00:04:59.057 --> 00:05:02.325
So the automatic
announcements can go awry and

80
00:05:02.325 --> 00:05:05.943
end up being less helpful
than we think they would.

81
00:05:05.943 --> 00:05:08.191
So we wanna use this sparingly.
