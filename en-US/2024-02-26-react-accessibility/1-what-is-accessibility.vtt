WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.150
So what is accessibility?

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.136
It really is ensuring that people can
use the experiences that we build,

3
00:00:07.136 --> 00:00:12.042
regardless of their physical ability,
mental ability, that they can

4
00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:18.370
interact with these services and products
that we're putting out on the web.

5
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.095
It also means that people
can contribute to the web.

6
00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:26.026
So if we're making authoring tools or,
I mean, a lot of services that

7
00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:30.458
we're building these days
are things we use in the workplace,

8
00:00:30.458 --> 00:00:32.895
HR software, banking software.

9
00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:37.815
I mean, all of those things are really
important to be accessible, right?

10
00:00:37.815 --> 00:00:42.173
So this topic can apply to so
many different things.

11
00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:46.103
And I think sometimes
organizations get that.

12
00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:51.946
It starts to get real muddy when it's less
of a clear requirement, like in agencies

13
00:00:51.946 --> 00:00:58.133
where you can kind of ship stuff without
anyone really holding you accountable.

14
00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.540
I think we can do better, though.

15
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.159
I work in an agency now too,
again, and it's great,

16
00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.120
but the requirements
are a little bit more loose.

17
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.192
And so, sometimes we really have to be
the champions within our workplaces

18
00:01:12.192 --> 00:01:17.680
to get people to understand the cost of
what not doing accessibility would mean.

19
00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.940
So the cost, really, to kind of get into
that is that someone with a disability

20
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.696
wouldn't be able to use your web
application or your website.

21
00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:33.376
They might not be able to independently
enter their bank details or something.

22
00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:36.306
It becomes a privacy issue or
a security issue.

23
00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:40.177
And so it sort of snowballs
into being a bigger cost for

24
00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:45.266
those individuals, but
those individuals are often marginalized.

25
00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.424
So that's kind of the heart
of what we're getting at,

26
00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:51.456
is not marginalizing people
who have a disability.

27
00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:59.092
It's kind of a, I don't know, heavy
feeling when you really think about it.

28
00:01:59.092 --> 00:02:02.303
It's not just edge cases here, these
are real people that we're talking about.

29
00:02:03.743 --> 00:02:09.847
So it's foundational and there is
a rich history of disability rights and

30
00:02:09.847 --> 00:02:13.993
activism to try and
make things more accessible.

31
00:02:15.723 --> 00:02:20.315
Here I have a picture of the Capitol Crawl
from the 70s here people

32
00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:25.235
physically put their bodies on
inaccessible stairways to advocate for

33
00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:30.160
accessible spaces, including
the Americans with Disabilities Act.

34
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.073
Which is a big piece of legislation
in the United States that codified

35
00:02:35.073 --> 00:02:37.681
a lot of these requirements.

36
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:43.261
And so people have been fighting for
access for decades, and it's really

37
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:49.685
relevant to us now in that we're still
pushing for the web to be accessible.

38
00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:53.975
We have some benefits of being developers
in that it's a lot easier to rebuild

39
00:02:53.975 --> 00:02:56.965
a digital space than a physical space.

40
00:02:56.965 --> 00:02:59.275
So we can incrementally improve things.

41
00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:01.942
We can totally tear it down and

42
00:03:01.942 --> 00:03:04.737
start over without having to
tear down a physical building.

43
00:03:05.867 --> 00:03:12.327
We can make changes to things a little
bit easier in a lot of cases, not always.

44
00:03:12.327 --> 00:03:15.177
I work on a code base that
is not that easy to change.

45
00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:21.124
So it does take some effort and some
planning and lots of development cycles.

46
00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:22.004
But it can be done.

47
00:03:23.614 --> 00:03:26.955
So really recognize that
history of activism,

48
00:03:26.955 --> 00:03:31.974
that's kind of an important part of
it that we should really remember.

49
00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:36.899
And there are so
many different types of people in

50
00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.652
the world that when disability
as a topic comes up,

51
00:03:39.652 --> 00:03:43.962
we wanna consider all of the different
ways that people move through the world.

52
00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:48.823
What are people's bodies, how does that
impact how they interact with a computer?

53
00:03:48.823 --> 00:03:50.931
If someone has a vision disability,

54
00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:56.243
that's kind of the area we hear about the
most with people who use screen readers.

55
00:03:56.243 --> 00:04:00.933
We'll dive way into screen
readers in the next section.

56
00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:03.673
But vision is one aspect of disability.

57
00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:07.533
Someone could have limited movement
if they can't use a mouse,

58
00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:11.179
a pointing device,
cognitive disabilities for thinking,

59
00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:14.843
remembering, learning,
communicating, hearing.

60
00:04:14.843 --> 00:04:17.943
That's a big one for
accessibility that's often forgotten.

61
00:04:17.943 --> 00:04:20.763
So things like transcripts and
closed captions.

62
00:04:20.763 --> 00:04:26.128
This workshop will need to be
captioned for people to follow along.

63
00:04:26.128 --> 00:04:30.052
And people can have more
than one disability.

64
00:04:30.052 --> 00:04:32.988
People don't fit neatly into little boxes.

65
00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:37.915
And so we wanna consider the broad kind of
spectrum of the human experience when it

66
00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:41.833
comes to disability,
because it can affect anyone at any time.

67
00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.534
So it really affects all of us
when you think of it that way.

68
00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:49.074
It's not the other person that
someone else, it's not my customer,

69
00:04:49.074 --> 00:04:51.024
it's not my problem.

70
00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:54.698
Well if you look a little closer,
it probably is your coworker or

71
00:04:54.698 --> 00:04:57.774
your customer might have color blindness.

72
00:04:57.774 --> 00:05:02.014
They might have diabetes and
they're at risk of losing their eyesight.

73
00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:05.739
Like I hear these stories all the time
when you ask people and they go, wait,

74
00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:08.105
I do have a connection to this.

75
00:05:08.105 --> 00:05:09.705
And so, yeah.

76
00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:14.195
&gt;&gt; I got my eyes dilated yesterday,
and as I was sitting there waiting,

77
00:05:14.195 --> 00:05:18.551
I was looking at my phone,
everything got blurrier and blurrier.

78
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:21.401
And then I left, and
then I had to do something on my phone and

79
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.119
I couldn't read my phone anymore.

80
00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:27.929
So I had to pull out
the accessibility zoomer on my phone.

81
00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:33.339
So that type of stuff affected
me directly yesterday.

82
00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.739
&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah, and
your phone has great tools for that.

83
00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:42.061
My parents have their phones
zoomed way in, you look over and

84
00:05:42.061 --> 00:05:44.128
their font size is huge.

85
00:05:44.128 --> 00:05:48.358
Technology is adaptive and it's so cool.

86
00:05:48.358 --> 00:05:49.818
I mean, bicycles are adaptive.

87
00:05:49.818 --> 00:05:54.620
There's all kinds of things in
the world now that we can adapt to make

88
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.908
them suit our lived experience more.

89
00:05:57.908 --> 00:06:02.884
And the web has so many different
things that we can make better.

90
00:06:02.884 --> 00:06:04.894
And they're not even that hard.

91
00:06:04.894 --> 00:06:07.494
It's just it's stuff
that gets marginalized.

92
00:06:07.494 --> 00:06:11.509
So I'm here to hold your hand.

93
00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:15.424
[LAUGH] We're gonna do it cuz there's so
many easy wins.

94
00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:20.384
The most accessibility issues that we see
out there in the world are really easy

95
00:06:20.384 --> 00:06:22.350
things to fix.

96
00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.255
So we can be glass half full thinkers and
just go all right,

97
00:06:26.255 --> 00:06:28.660
we've got lots of stuff we can fix.

98
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:29.726
Let's fix it.

99
00:06:29.726 --> 00:06:34.191
Let's build it right from the first
time because it is really adaptive, and

100
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:36.080
we can make it work.

101
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.345
And I'm pretty optimistic about it.

102
00:06:40.345 --> 00:06:46.048
So it's really easy to find
accessibility failures out there and

103
00:06:46.048 --> 00:06:49.480
accessibility folks, I love them.

104
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.141
I think it's part of the coping mechanism
of dealing with the fact that the web

105
00:06:54.141 --> 00:06:57.583
isn't very accessible,
is to point out the failures and

106
00:06:57.583 --> 00:07:00.825
then as a group you're like,
isn't this terrible?

107
00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:02.991
But we need more wins too.

108
00:07:02.991 --> 00:07:05.041
It's like we don't wanna
be drowning in misery.

109
00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:07.331
We want to highlight our wins.

110
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:11.291
So I encourage you when you get
something that's an improvement,

111
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:15.001
even if it's a work in progress,
celebrate it.

112
00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:19.081
Give kudos to your teammates,
share things with your teams.

113
00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:23.453
Share what you've learned if you've
got the capacity to write it down.

114
00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:25.871
Some of the blog posts
that I wrote in the past,

115
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:30.553
I'm really glad I wrote them because I
captured what I learned at the time.

116
00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:33.563
And I just want to encourage
everyone to celebrate your wins.

117
00:07:34.593 --> 00:07:38.483
I created a blog a while back called
Accessibility Wins that was aimed

118
00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:40.173
at doing this.

119
00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:43.537
It got a little hard to maintain
because I've always was striving for

120
00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:46.643
perfection and that's just not realistic.

121
00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:48.443
We don't need to be perfect.

122
00:07:48.443 --> 00:07:52.483
We just need to keep putting in
the effort to make things better.

123
00:07:52.483 --> 00:07:57.895
And if it takes a number of cycles or
iterations on something

124
00:07:57.895 --> 00:08:02.564
to get it better and better,
I think that's okay.

125
00:08:02.564 --> 00:08:07.185
But we've got some really important
reasons to overcome what I'm calling

126
00:08:07.185 --> 00:08:08.294
access debt.

127
00:08:08.294 --> 00:08:12.694
So we have design debt, we have
technical debt, we have access debt.

128
00:08:12.694 --> 00:08:16.545
Stuff in our code base,
I mean the design and development are so

129
00:08:16.545 --> 00:08:21.487
overlapping in what create these problems
that we've got a unique type of debt,

130
00:08:21.487 --> 00:08:23.851
that is accessibility debt.

131
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:26.759
And the reasons that we
need to overcome it,

132
00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.690
the most basic reason thinking
back to the Capitol Crawl and

133
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:36.661
the disability rights and activism is,
it's a civil right to have access.

134
00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:40.347
And that should be enough,
that really should be enough of a reason.

135
00:08:40.347 --> 00:08:44.437
It's something we've been fighting for for
decades and we really should honor that.

136
00:08:44.437 --> 00:08:46.677
It's the right thing to do.

137
00:08:46.677 --> 00:08:50.457
Sometimes that is just
lost in translation.

138
00:08:50.457 --> 00:08:54.983
And so depending on who you need to
convince, maybe you have some other

139
00:08:54.983 --> 00:09:00.142
stakeholders or coworkers or people who
just don't care for whatever reason.

140
00:09:00.142 --> 00:09:03.071
There's other reasons that we can
kind of pull out as a carrot.

141
00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:04.397
We have the carrot and

142
00:09:04.397 --> 00:09:08.971
the stick way of communicating our
reasons why this is important.

143
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:12.713
The legal issues are a big stick to use.

144
00:09:12.713 --> 00:09:15.753
People, depending on
what country you're in,

145
00:09:15.753 --> 00:09:20.724
you have different laws that make
accessibility a requirement, especially in

146
00:09:20.724 --> 00:09:25.859
certain sectors like anything procured
by the federal government, education.

147
00:09:27.209 --> 00:09:30.949
There's lots of different areas
where the legal side applies.

148
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:33.629
It's not my favorite aspect of it,
but it is part of it.

149
00:09:35.209 --> 00:09:39.451
Sometimes pride in your craft is
the way to get through to people,

150
00:09:39.451 --> 00:09:43.703
like being pragmatic about
quality in your software.

151
00:09:43.703 --> 00:09:48.356
And sometimes that can be the angle to
get someone sort of selfishly to care

152
00:09:48.356 --> 00:09:53.253
about it is that you can make it easier
to test, you could make it more robust.

153
00:09:54.263 --> 00:09:58.748
Being able to make your application
respond to different user inputs that you

154
00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:01.187
haven't even thought of yet.

155
00:10:01.187 --> 00:10:02.527
It's just more robust software.

156
00:10:03.797 --> 00:10:07.557
And it's mostly,
the web is mostly accessible by default.

157
00:10:07.557 --> 00:10:08.947
We just have to try not to mess it up.

158
00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:11.787
And then there's business cases.

159
00:10:11.787 --> 00:10:15.231
If you have to convince
business stakeholders,

160
00:10:15.231 --> 00:10:19.851
maybe there's a way to persuade
these folks about having a larger

161
00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:23.474
customer reach,
a risk of losing out on business.

162
00:10:24.524 --> 00:10:29.448
And so, yeah, there's all these different
levers that we can kind of pull

163
00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:31.886
to make the case for accessibility.

164
00:10:31.886 --> 00:10:36.380
Which I do have to say though,
as a single interactive developer,

165
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.595
UI developer, full stack, whatever your
role is, it's a bit much to try and

166
00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:45.205
carry this weight on your
back all the time to be like,

167
00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:50.056
I'm doing this work and trying to
convince everyone around me to do it.

168
00:10:50.056 --> 00:10:52.836
So I want you to give yourself some grace.

169
00:10:54.016 --> 00:10:58.835
That's why accessibility can be sort
of draining, but I want to invigorate

170
00:10:58.835 --> 00:11:03.064
you to find the things that you can
control and that you can change.

171
00:11:03.064 --> 00:11:04.994
And we want to make progress.

172
00:11:04.994 --> 00:11:08.463
That's why celebrating
those wins is important.

173
00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:11.798
We want to balance all of this
with getting our job done and

174
00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:16.124
upholding quality among all the other
things that we have to think about.

175
00:11:17.707 --> 00:11:21.437
I have some links here if you want
to learn more about the legal side.

176
00:11:21.437 --> 00:11:26.903
There is a link in here about Target's
legal case, sort of relevant.

177
00:11:26.903 --> 00:11:30.282
It's how I got into accessibility
was because of that legal case.

178
00:11:30.282 --> 00:11:32.234
So if you wanna read about that.
