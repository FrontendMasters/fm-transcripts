1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.980
Well, now that I've told you all of
this information, let's apply it.

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.230
Let's do some testing.

3
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.480
So we have our first exercise.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.790
Our first exercise is to try and
navigate a screen reader.

5
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.460
So here in class, I'll do this so
that we can do it together.

6
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.195
And I'm gonna turn on the screen reader,
so you'll get to hear Voiceover.

7
00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:29.365
We have this Book A Trip form mimicked
after one on an airline website.

8
00:00:29.365 --> 00:00:32.285
And so this was built with React.

9
00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:38.035
I can change it from one way to two way,
[LAUGH] a return trip.

10
00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:42.871
Pretty simple form, and
has the default browser date pickers.

11
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:47.381
So we can see how accessible
the default date pickers are.

12
00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:52.421
There's also this little children
widget that has buttons to, like if you

13
00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:58.101
were gonna fly with 12 kids, [LAUGH] just
figuring out what my maximum should be or,

14
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:03.643
yeah, 12 children, you could really
choose chaos and fly with 12 children.

15
00:01:03.643 --> 00:01:11.219
But this Adults drop-down is a native HTML
select element, so we can play with that.

16
00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.679
And there's a couple images down
here just to get us inspired for

17
00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.811
adventure travel up the North Cascades
a couple of months ago and Hawaii.

18
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:22.909
That just sounds so nice, warmer weather.

19
00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:27.229
So let's open this up with VoiceOver.

20
00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.149
So I'm on a Mac computer.

21
00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.649
So to open up VoiceOver,
I will hold my function key first.

22
00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.453
If you have a desktop keyboard,
you won't have a function key, but

23
00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:43.426
on a Mac laptop,
it would be Function+Command+F5.

24
00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:45.204
&gt;&gt; Navigation, visited link.

25
00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:49.936
Heading level 1, web accessibility V3,
current item, visited link, all topics.

26
00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:52.576
Search documentation,
search text field link.

27
00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:53.816
Command K link.

28
00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:57.868
&gt;&gt; So at any time, a little bit of
a navigation tip when you're running

29
00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:02.415
VoiceOver, is that to get it to stop
reading, you can press the Ctrl key, so

30
00:02:02.415 --> 00:02:07.723
especially when you're talking [LAUGH]
the same time, it can be pretty helpful.

31
00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:11.606
You can also click on the page to kind
of get to an area that you wanna test so

32
00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:14.483
you don't have to navigate
through the whole thing.

33
00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:18.732
Cuz I want us to focus on this Book a Trip
form whereas there are a ton of other

34
00:02:18.732 --> 00:02:21.766
elements on the page for
the slide which Materials.

35
00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:24.497
So I'm gonna click closer to this form.

36
00:02:24.497 --> 00:02:27.919
I could even click on-
&gt;&gt; Level one, link, permalink for

37
00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.712
this section, main,
you are currently on a link.

38
00:02:30.712 --> 00:02:34.997
&gt;&gt; So my first key that I
often use is the tab key.

39
00:02:34.997 --> 00:02:35.972
Let's hit tab, see what happens.

40
00:02:35.972 --> 00:02:39.764
&gt;&gt; One way, on check, checkbox,
book a flight, group, check, one way.

41
00:02:39.764 --> 00:02:41.402
&gt;&gt; So if I hit the spacebar
&gt;&gt; Bar,

42
00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:45.175
I can toggle that element
depending on what element it is,

43
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:48.795
what type of role, and
keyboard accessibility it has.

44
00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:53.559
&gt;&gt; Use miles on check checkbox.

45
00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.270
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; And so the tab key, however,

46
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.124
is not the only way to navigate.

47
00:02:58.124 --> 00:03:02.986
So from that cheat sheet, I reference
Myself this morning to remember,

48
00:03:02.986 --> 00:03:07.675
there are the voiceover keys,
which are Control and Option.

49
00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:10.995
And if I do Control, Option,
right arrow, I can go to the next item,

50
00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:12.675
whatever that item happens to be.

51
00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:15.779
&gt;&gt; From,
you are currently on a text element.

52
00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.277
From, edit text.

53
00:03:17.277 --> 00:03:20.037
You are to,
you are currently on a text element.

54
00:03:20.037 --> 00:03:21.908
Edit text, blank.

55
00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:27.257
Departure, departure date, edit text,
you are currently on an edit text.

56
00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:31.813
To enter the state field
press ctrl option shift down

57
00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:36.471
arrow 0 3 you are currently
on a stepper inside minus

58
00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:41.419
0 to 2024 you end of text so,
&gt;&gt; I can use arrow keys I can type I can

59
00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.881
do all kinda things in here.

60
00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:47.559
So depending on what type of element
it is, so if it's a text field,

61
00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:52.531
if it's an image, if it's a heading,
it will announce that type of element.

62
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.591
So that's relevant.

63
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:57.711
If things are labeled or not,
that will also be part of it.

64
00:03:57.711 --> 00:04:00.361
So this form field from,

65
00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:05.801
you are currently on
a textile Element is labeled.

66
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.471
If I go down further to images.

67
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:09.131
&gt;&gt; Edittext.

68
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:10.141
Edittext.

69
00:04:10.141 --> 00:04:15.181
Imageseditxt, lelevel one visited l,
Other assistive technologies.

70
00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:16.764
characteralett, close b Chrome.

71
00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:20.313
Screened major is a dirt path next to
a small lake with fall colors of red,

72
00:04:20.313 --> 00:04:21.255
yellow and green.

73
00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:23.925
The sky is blue with wispy high clouds,
image.

74
00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:25.741
You are currently on the image.

75
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:27.205
&gt;&gt; So there's some alt text.

76
00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:29.722
So it's fun to navigate around.

77
00:04:29.722 --> 00:04:32.936
You can play with the screen reader,
and then we'll come back.

78
00:04:39.698 --> 00:04:43.649
We were testing with VoiceOver on the Mac.

79
00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.670
There was one more part of
it that I wanted to show you

80
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.790
just before we get going.

81
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.506
So I'm gonna fire VoiceOver back
up with function Command F5.

82
00:04:53.506 --> 00:04:56.894
&gt;&gt; Navigation, visited,
link, heading level one.

83
00:04:56.894 --> 00:05:01.122
&gt;&gt; There is a feature in VoiceOver called
the rotor that you should know about.

84
00:05:01.122 --> 00:05:03.190
It is a tool that I use quite often.

85
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.010
So VoiceOver, I'd say I test it
maybe like a couple times a week,

86
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.370
if I'm actively developing
a user interface.

87
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.465
Maybe not every single
time I go to test it, but

88
00:05:16.465 --> 00:05:21.088
I do test it regularly to
check out specific things.

89
00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:27.055
If I'm working on a form or something
that I want to know what's going on.

90
00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:28.160
So with the rotor,

91
00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.246
I can open it with the VoiceOver
keys which are Control+Option and U.

92
00:05:32.246 --> 00:05:35.345
&gt;&gt; The links menu, on item, all topics.

93
00:05:35.345 --> 00:05:39.402
&gt;&gt; So the rotor is configurable
in your VoiceOver utility and

94
00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:42.810
it will list out everything
that's on the page.

95
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.000
So we're looking at links right now.

96
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.389
This is showing everything on this
whole workshop resources site,

97
00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.820
what's on the current page.

98
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.100
If I use the left and right arrow keys, I
can go through different types of groups.

99
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.800
&gt;&gt; Landmarks menu, on item complementary.

100
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.432
&gt;&gt; So the landmarks, and I can arrow up or
down to have it highlight those tings.

101
00:06:02.432 --> 00:06:05.832
And then if I hit the Enter key,
it would take me to that element.

102
00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:07.790
&gt;&gt; Table of contents navigation.

103
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.534
Form Controls menu,
on item Search documentation.

104
00:06:10.534 --> 00:06:13.582
Search, text, feel, blank,
&gt;&gt; All the form controls

105
00:06:13.582 --> 00:06:15.392
&gt;&gt; Headings menu, on item, 1,

106
00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:16.552
&gt;&gt; All the headings.

107
00:06:16.552 --> 00:06:18.082
So this one's pretty useful.

108
00:06:19.242 --> 00:06:20.502
Which headings are on the page?

109
00:06:20.502 --> 00:06:21.672
What number do they have?

110
00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:26.534
So that 1, 2, those are the heading
levels, so an h1 or an h2.

111
00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:32.074
And it can be pretty useful to see what
is VoiceOver picking up on our page.

112
00:06:32.074 --> 00:06:36.974
And so as developers, there's a bit
of a learning curve, I would say.

113
00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:40.597
You could see I'm not super
proficient with VoiceOver, but

114
00:06:40.597 --> 00:06:43.030
I do test it to be become more familiar.

115
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.630
I reference those cheat sheets and
I use the rotor.

116
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.696
It is super helpful to be able
to look at things at a glance.

117
00:06:49.696 --> 00:06:50.610
&gt;&gt; Buttons menu.

118
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.549
On item Introduction, button, group.

119
00:06:53.549 --> 00:06:59.095
&gt;&gt; So to get out of the rotor, I'll hit
Escape, and then I can turn VoiceOver off.

120
00:06:59.095 --> 00:07:01.367
&gt;&gt; You are currently on the link,
VoiceOver off.

121
00:07:01.367 --> 00:07:04.370
That little x,
often the quickest way to turn it off.

122
00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.804
You can also use the same command of
the function Cmd+F5 to turn it off.

123
00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:11.972
So the rotor I wanted to show
to you before we move on,

124
00:07:11.972 --> 00:07:14.902
just because of what a helpful tool it is.

125
00:07:14.902 --> 00:07:18.598
Sometimes it can be effective at
communicating with your colleagues, like,

126
00:07:18.598 --> 00:07:21.612
no, we really do need to
make these changes, [LAUGH].

127
00:07:21.612 --> 00:07:25.909
And if you can show them what's
happening in the screen reader somehow,

128
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:27.112
that can be useful.
