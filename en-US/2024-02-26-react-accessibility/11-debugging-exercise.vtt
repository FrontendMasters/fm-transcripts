WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.371
&gt;&gt; Marcy: Let's do an exercise
on debugging some webpages.

2
00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:08.661
We went through some steps earlier,
so here they are recapped.

3
00:00:08.661 --> 00:00:10.464
We're gonna test with the keyboard.

4
00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:14.571
Can we reach, operate, and
see every focused interactive control?

5
00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:18.910
So things that mouse users can do,
can we do that with the keyboard?

6
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.875
We're gonna use browser DevTools and
extensions, including X.

7
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:28.452
The accessibility inspector
in Chrome DevTools itself,

8
00:00:28.452 --> 00:00:31.305
will zoom in and test reflow.

9
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:36.410
We probably won't fire up a screen reader
at this point, just for time purposes.

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.706
But that is something that I put kind of
further down the list to do regularly.

11
00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:44.894
We'll look at things like motion and
color contrast,

12
00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:48.308
some of which will come up in
things like the AX extension.

13
00:00:48.308 --> 00:00:54.320
And then if I'm checking things kind of
broadly, if there's any videos, or media.

14
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.450
I make a note to ask my team for
captions and

15
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.854
transcripts cuz like if
nobody brings it up.

16
00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:06.048
If no one brings it up and might never
ever get included on the site and

17
00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:08.794
then someone is totally excluded.

18
00:01:08.794 --> 00:01:15.254
So better late than never to say hey,
we need to generate some caption content.

19
00:01:15.254 --> 00:01:17.754
So I have some sites that we could try.

20
00:01:17.754 --> 00:01:22.560
If you have a site that you're working on,
that's probably a great thing to check out

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.447
and get a picture on what's
happening on the site.

22
00:01:25.447 --> 00:01:30.560
But I have some different categories
here like I love music, so

23
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.457
I was gonna test SoundCloud,
news websites are notoriously terrible.

24
00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:41.817
E-commerce, there's some great,
some could use help target's actually

25
00:01:41.817 --> 00:01:47.599
pretty good cuz they were sued, and so
it's become part of their regular process.

26
00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:52.609
Productivity apps like Google Docs, I
have a Google Doc that you can check out.

27
00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:59.706
And those apps are really advanced,
the Google Drive applications are,

28
00:01:59.706 --> 00:02:05.328
they put a lot of effort into
accessibility, bless them.

29
00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:07.534
They're putting in the effort,

30
00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:11.244
we'll have to ask users like
how is it working for them?

31
00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:15.515
But there are some really cool
accessibility techniques in some of

32
00:02:15.515 --> 00:02:16.361
those apps.

33
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.584
&gt;&gt; Marcy: So let's open up an app and
test it, let's test SoundCloud.

34
00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:35.337
&gt;&gt; Marcy: Hopefully it won't
just start playing, so

35
00:02:35.337 --> 00:02:37.287
I follow a lot of record labels.

36
00:02:37.287 --> 00:02:42.757
I listen to music all the time, and so
I have a ton of content saved in here.

37
00:02:42.757 --> 00:02:47.287
I like that it has lots of
interactive components on it.

38
00:02:47.287 --> 00:02:49.966
So it's got lots of links.

39
00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:55.034
First step, I hit the tab key,
I do not see a focus style.

40
00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:56.678
So, interestingly enough,

41
00:02:56.678 --> 00:03:00.504
I mentioned earlier I made a blog
of wins called accessibility wins.

42
00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:04.403
And this is the first site I gave
a win to, and it has degraded for

43
00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:06.179
accessibility since then.

44
00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:11.203
I have to recall that win,
I think, unfortunately.

45
00:03:11.203 --> 00:03:13.629
I mean, teams change, software changes.

46
00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.067
So, the focus style on
the feed button is very faint.

47
00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:22.217
It went from a gray text,
gray on gray, to white on gray.

48
00:03:22.217 --> 00:03:26.507
That is not sufficient at all for
a focus style.

49
00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:31.591
We should just show an outline,
something that has enough contrast

50
00:03:31.591 --> 00:03:35.974
from the items around it that
you can tell what is focused.

51
00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:38.892
Cuz that's just not really acceptable.

52
00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:43.330
So if I keep tabbing,
now I'm in the search box,

53
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.655
I can skip I think maybe
the search button, is focusable.

54
00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:51.541
So the first thing I'm gonna go inspect so

55
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.841
I'm gonna go inspect why I had
a tab stop that I couldn't see.

56
00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.570
So I'm gonna do Ctrl+Click, Inspect, and

57
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.308
I'll make the DevTools
a little bit bigger.

58
00:04:03.308 --> 00:04:09.537
So this button over here, I see I've
got the input, I've got a button.

59
00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:14.707
And in Chrome DevTools, in this
little hover, I can click on focus.

60
00:04:14.707 --> 00:04:17.938
There's our first big
keyboard accessibility issue.

61
00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:23.388
There is an outline of zero on these
elements looks like header search submit.

62
00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:26.843
So they were very specific
about suppressing the focus

63
00:04:26.843 --> 00:04:28.278
style on this button.

64
00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:34.989
If I uncheck that, there's probably
another one somewhere because I don't see.

65
00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:39.859
A focus style, so there might be multiple
of things that are causing this.

66
00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:47.298
And I have to go digging cuz it should
just show a focus dial, but it's not.

67
00:04:47.298 --> 00:04:50.879
Sometimes focus might not
be the pseudo selector.

68
00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.838
Maybe focus visible could be another one.

69
00:04:53.838 --> 00:05:01.180
That's a newer selector that tries to
exclude mouse focus from keyboard focus.

70
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.702
It can be pretty helpful sometimes.

71
00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:04.058
Wait, that, that worked.

72
00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:09.558
I just noticed, when I selected focus
visible, I did get the default outline.

73
00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:11.848
So there you go.

74
00:05:11.848 --> 00:05:16.899
But that's an issue that I can surface
pretty quickly just by tabbing.

75
00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:22.668
And then inspecting the CSS for a given
element, cuz that should be focus-visible.

76
00:05:22.668 --> 00:05:25.158
It should show style so
I can see where I am.

77
00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:29.958
I mean, this blue border doesn't look
great cuz there's no padding on the icon.

78
00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:32.968
So if I put padding on it in the button,

79
00:05:32.968 --> 00:05:38.818
it will add a little bit of space around
the icon so I can see like around it.

80
00:05:38.818 --> 00:05:41.618
So and
you can even do a custom focus style too.

81
00:05:41.618 --> 00:05:45.147
You don't have to use the default one but
it is pretty handy.

82
00:05:45.147 --> 00:05:50.379
So I'm gonna reset that and I'm gonna
click back in that search field just so

83
00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.215
I know that my keyboard focus is in
the browser and not in the DevTools.

84
00:05:55.215 --> 00:05:59.345
And I'm gonna keep tabbing,
get to some other widgets.

85
00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:02.772
So real lack of focus dials that
are visible on some of these,

86
00:06:02.772 --> 00:06:07.095
like a little caret changing color to
white, that's just not sufficient.

87
00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:09.685
But it is accessible otherwise.

88
00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:16.545
I can hit Enter and open this little
profile thing, I can tab into these items.

89
00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:20.176
It does some wrapping,
so my focus goes around.

90
00:06:20.176 --> 00:06:25.039
That's pretty cool, I think I can hit
escape and go back, the bones are there,

91
00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:27.736
there's some tweaks that they could make.

92
00:06:27.736 --> 00:06:31.708
They did make that component at
least keyboard accessible except for

93
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:32.741
the focus style.

94
00:06:32.741 --> 00:06:35.131
Kind of not really being sufficient.

95
00:06:35.131 --> 00:06:36.351
So that's good news though, right?

96
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:39.927
It's like something we can work with that
we don't have to completely rip it out and

97
00:06:39.927 --> 00:06:40.501
start over.

98
00:06:40.501 --> 00:06:43.856
It might just be some simple CSS fixes.

99
00:06:43.856 --> 00:06:49.248
So let's run x on this,
&gt;&gt; Marcy: We'll

100
00:06:49.248 --> 00:06:52.743
see what kind of issues it finds when
I ran it earlier there were a ton.

101
00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:56.083
248 or something.

102
00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:58.773
So it's got quite a few issues.

103
00:06:58.773 --> 00:07:03.623
Best practices are on,
if I turn those off, that was only a few.

104
00:07:03.623 --> 00:07:08.452
So the difference there is that best
practices are things like landmark

105
00:07:08.452 --> 00:07:11.923
elements that are great but
not totally required.

106
00:07:11.923 --> 00:07:15.626
Whereas with CAG violations
are the things that you should fix first.

107
00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:18.911
Like, those are the ones that,
if you were sued,

108
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:22.756
they wouldn't sue you over best practices,
basically.

109
00:07:22.756 --> 00:07:26.646
But there's lots of
interesting things in here.

110
00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:30.906
Like, elements must only
use permitted ARIA roles.

111
00:07:30.906 --> 00:07:35.515
So one reason why I mentioned kind of
taking a pause before slapping ARIA.

112
00:07:35.515 --> 00:07:39.080
On everything is there's some
requirements that you kind

113
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.238
of have to learn like everything
related to a given ARIA attribute.

114
00:07:43.238 --> 00:07:46.807
Like are there other roles
that it has to work with or

115
00:07:46.807 --> 00:07:49.386
certain rules that it's required.

116
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:52.090
Or will only work with so like,

117
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:57.811
this one is complaining that you
can't use ARIA label on a span and

118
00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:03.343
actually this is a typo so
ARIA does -role is not an attribute.

119
00:08:03.343 --> 00:08:05.799
It's close, its role image.

120
00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:11.361
So that's a really subtle error that
if I was scanning it with my eyes,

121
00:08:11.361 --> 00:08:13.450
maybe I would catch that.

122
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.478
But the computer is pretty good
at pointing this stuff out to us.

123
00:08:16.478 --> 00:08:20.864
And there's probably
an issue in here about,

124
00:08:20.864 --> 00:08:25.256
ARIA attributes must
conform to valid names.

125
00:08:25.256 --> 00:08:25.868
So yeah,

126
00:08:25.868 --> 00:08:31.001
there is a rule in here that will tell us
that aria-role is not a real attribute.

127
00:08:31.001 --> 00:08:34.408
Cuz we can't make them up,
there's a standard set of role states and

128
00:08:34.408 --> 00:08:35.126
properties.

129
00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:39.919
So Axe is doing a really great job
here of surfacing some issues that

130
00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.894
are kind of easy mistakes.

131
00:08:41.894 --> 00:08:47.043
I mean, it's an easy fix, but
it's an easy thing to mess up, too.

132
00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:52.385
So, fortunately, our tooling is really
great, it's surfacing that for us now.

133
00:08:52.385 --> 00:08:55.589
So some things about Axe I
could point out, too.

134
00:08:55.589 --> 00:09:00.026
If I need to see what element this is,
I can do Highlight, and

135
00:09:00.026 --> 00:09:05.333
it'll highlight it in pink up there
on the screen, that can be helpful.

136
00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:09.735
Sometimes it'll report things that are not
even visible, maybe they have screen

137
00:09:09.735 --> 00:09:14.286
reader only on them or something, and it's
just in a state that you didn't expect.

138
00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:17.907
So highlight can help to get you
to that where it is on the page.

139
00:09:17.907 --> 00:09:21.136
And then there's also this
little Inspect element.

140
00:09:21.136 --> 00:09:25.712
That one I use a lot, it will jump me
over to the Elements Inspector, and

141
00:09:25.712 --> 00:09:28.322
I can go over here and look at an element.

142
00:09:28.322 --> 00:09:31.906
We talked earlier about alt text for
images.

143
00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:37.526
So to circle back to that, there's
a tool in here that you must know about.

144
00:09:37.526 --> 00:09:40.850
So over here next to Styles,
Computed, Layout, etc,

145
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.615
the little caret icon,
there is an accessibility inspector.

146
00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:46.429
This is your new best friend.

147
00:09:46.429 --> 00:09:49.375
[LAUGH] It's amazing, I love this tool.

148
00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:52.340
Here's our next mention of
the accessibility tree.

149
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.456
So this is sort of parallel to the DOM.

150
00:09:55.456 --> 00:10:01.873
It will highlight all of the accessibility
information that is in the DOM.

151
00:10:01.873 --> 00:10:05.575
And for an image, so this is interesting.

152
00:10:05.575 --> 00:10:07.856
So it's showing us that the role,

153
00:10:07.856 --> 00:10:12.430
because that aria-role is not a real
attribute, it should be role.

154
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:17.419
It will say its role is generic,
whereas if I change this to role,

155
00:10:17.419 --> 00:10:21.158
this will update, and
now it has a role of image.

156
00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:24.241
That was just a soft edit in the DevTools.

157
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.650
You'd have to go change it in your real
code base, but I can at least fiddle

158
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:34.649
with it here in the browser, and
this will show me which thing wins.

159
00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:38.541
So if I had an aria-labelledby
pointing to some other element,

160
00:10:38.541 --> 00:10:40.060
I could see if it worked.

161
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:41.448
And this is the step,

162
00:10:41.448 --> 00:10:45.627
the question about how much we
should test with a screen reader.

163
00:10:45.627 --> 00:10:47.697
You should start with this, for sure,

164
00:10:47.697 --> 00:10:50.788
because this is what the screen
reader is going to look at.

165
00:10:50.788 --> 00:10:53.313
And it's gonna look at
the accessibility tree and

166
00:10:53.313 --> 00:10:55.908
all of these computed properties and
everything.

167
00:10:55.908 --> 00:11:00.124
You can get most of the way there
just by using this tool and Axe.

168
00:11:00.124 --> 00:11:05.215
If you clean up all that stuff and
do the debugging, you'll get pretty far.

169
00:11:05.215 --> 00:11:10.835
So for your alt text fallback, trying
to style that, for those techniques,

170
00:11:10.835 --> 00:11:16.722
you could go and inspect what is actually
getting spit out for the screen reader.

171
00:11:16.722 --> 00:11:21.953
Did I accidentally hide it
from every screen reader user,

172
00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:27.301
or is it actually picking up
the text in the way that I hoped?

173
00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:28.977
So this one's pretty essential.

174
00:11:28.977 --> 00:11:33.547
Yeah, it's amazing to me
how hidden this tool is.

175
00:11:33.547 --> 00:11:36.485
It's so powerful and so helpful.

176
00:11:36.485 --> 00:11:40.648
Now you know it's there,
if you didn't already.

177
00:11:40.648 --> 00:11:45.504
Okay, so DevTools, that's super helpful.

178
00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:49.017
If I go back to Axe,
let me zoom this out one level,

179
00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:51.458
I wanna see some contrast issues.

180
00:11:51.458 --> 00:11:56.913
Cuz that is a lot of the accessibility
issues are contrast-related.

181
00:11:56.913 --> 00:12:00.647
And so this says that it
ensures that the foreground and

182
00:12:00.647 --> 00:12:04.311
background colors meet
the minimum contrast ratio.

183
00:12:04.311 --> 00:12:07.800
So depending on the font size,
this is a small font size,

184
00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:12.684
I guess I'm gonna highlight so I know
which element we're talking about here.

185
00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:17.779
It's the orange Try Go+
text on a gray background.

186
00:12:17.779 --> 00:12:21.947
It almost looks like it
could meet the ratio.

187
00:12:21.947 --> 00:12:24.582
So it needs to be 4.5 to 1.

188
00:12:24.582 --> 00:12:28.052
We can calculate the ratio of values.

189
00:12:28.052 --> 00:12:32.869
Is there enough of a difference
that it has a ratio of at

190
00:12:32.869 --> 00:12:35.983
least 4.5 to 1 at 14 pixels?

191
00:12:35.983 --> 00:12:40.735
It has to be at least 18 points or
24 pixels to get above

192
00:12:40.735 --> 00:12:46.084
a threshold where it's big enough
that it only has to be 3 to 1.

193
00:12:46.084 --> 00:12:50.973
This doesn't meet that size threshold,
so it has to be 4.5 to 1, and

194
00:12:50.973 --> 00:12:52.826
it's only 3.94 to 1.

195
00:12:52.826 --> 00:12:56.238
So that's pretty close, but not quite.

196
00:12:56.238 --> 00:12:57.812
So we would wanna go in.

197
00:12:57.812 --> 00:13:00.029
In this case, it's kinda tough,

198
00:13:00.029 --> 00:13:03.862
because that's the SoundCloud
orange on the gray banner.

199
00:13:03.862 --> 00:13:10.193
So our options are, make the orange
darker, or make the gray lighter.

200
00:13:10.193 --> 00:13:12.204
I don't know,
I guess that's kind of a mind bender,

201
00:13:12.204 --> 00:13:13.467
what direction do you have to go?

202
00:13:13.467 --> 00:13:15.207
You'd have to change those colors.

203
00:13:15.207 --> 00:13:17.405
Maybe we can fiddle with it.

204
00:13:17.405 --> 00:13:20.851
So what I wanna try is see if
I can change the orange just

205
00:13:20.851 --> 00:13:25.536
enough to get to that 4.5 to 1,
cuz sometimes that's the solution.

206
00:13:25.536 --> 00:13:28.716
If it's off enough, or you have to
make it brown and it looks terrible,

207
00:13:28.716 --> 00:13:30.842
you're gonna have to
talk to your design team.

208
00:13:30.842 --> 00:13:33.387
Cuz it's like, you can't fake it.

209
00:13:33.387 --> 00:13:34.930
They're gonna be like, why is this brown?

210
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.986
[LAUGH] Cuz I was trying to
make it match contrast ratios.

211
00:13:38.986 --> 00:13:44.244
Just, you can't, but sometimes you can
just tweak it enough, so let's go see.

212
00:13:44.244 --> 00:13:48.341
This element is Try Go.

213
00:13:48.341 --> 00:13:53.867
So if I go to Inspect Related Node,
and I go back over to the Styles,

214
00:13:53.867 --> 00:13:58.732
if I lose it somehow,
I can go Ctrl+Click and inspect it.

215
00:13:58.732 --> 00:14:01.096
And so I know this element has an issue.

216
00:14:01.096 --> 00:14:04.975
This orange color, nice, it worked.

217
00:14:04.975 --> 00:14:09.094
So Chrome has a contrast tool,
it doesn't always work.

218
00:14:09.094 --> 00:14:13.995
I think it has to do with where the
background is, what element it's set on.

219
00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:17.673
It's very murky to me why it works,
sometimes it doesn't, but

220
00:14:17.673 --> 00:14:19.659
this time it worked, excellent.

221
00:14:19.659 --> 00:14:21.751
So it shows me this ratio.

222
00:14:21.751 --> 00:14:23.718
Oop, I didn't mean to open that.

223
00:14:23.718 --> 00:14:26.789
There's a little caret here,
I can expand it.

224
00:14:26.789 --> 00:14:29.489
So there's AA that needs to meet 4.5.

225
00:14:29.489 --> 00:14:34.905
If you're really swinging for the fences
and you wanna hit AAA, which is a higher

226
00:14:34.905 --> 00:14:40.816
standard, most companies or organizations
don't go for that, that would be 7 to 1.

227
00:14:40.816 --> 00:14:44.761
It would mean more people
could see the colors, but

228
00:14:44.761 --> 00:14:49.265
AA is kind of the agreed upon standard,
for the most part.

229
00:14:49.265 --> 00:14:54.589
So this contrast picker,
the reason I love it is I can drag.

230
00:14:54.589 --> 00:14:57.798
I can go like this, drag down the colors.

231
00:14:57.798 --> 00:14:59.380
I'm going the wrong direction.

232
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:05.989
So if I need to get up to 4.5 to 1,
I'm dragging over towards the white.

233
00:15:05.989 --> 00:15:13.120
And I just got it, and
I can barely perceive a difference.

234
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:17.608
So this one I could fiddle with, I think,
without having to go back to my team,

235
00:15:17.608 --> 00:15:18.773
see if they notice.

236
00:15:18.773 --> 00:15:21.452
This is a ask for
forgiveness situation, I think.

237
00:15:21.452 --> 00:15:25.950
You just sort of change your color
config to something that passes.

238
00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.268
And then every element that had
that color would benefit from it,

239
00:15:29.268 --> 00:15:31.454
and you could fix it in one go, hopefully.

240
00:15:31.454 --> 00:15:33.004
Let's see what this selector looks like.

241
00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:39.213
So, this color,
it's used on multiple elements, for sure.

242
00:15:39.213 --> 00:15:43.750
SoundCloud classic, looks like maybe
they're doing a redesign or something.

243
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:49.639
So sometimes that's hard, you're like our
customer-facing site is being phased out.

244
00:15:49.639 --> 00:15:52.739
It has all these accessibility problems,
but we're re-platforming,

245
00:15:52.739 --> 00:15:54.439
don't spend time fixing the old thing.

246
00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:57.365
It's like, well, but it's not gonna
be usable until you re-platform.

247
00:15:57.365 --> 00:16:03.512
So whether you get time to fix it or
not is, yeah, unclear, it'll depend.

248
00:16:03.512 --> 00:16:07.662
But if you can fix it with one
little tweak of a x color value or

249
00:16:07.662 --> 00:16:10.829
something, maybe you
can slide it in there.

250
00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:13.459
So that's the Chrome tool.

251
00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:16.049
When it works, it's great,
it doesn't always work.

252
00:16:16.049 --> 00:16:18.429
So I'm gonna show you the one in Firefox.

253
00:16:18.429 --> 00:16:19.871
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What would
it look like at triple A?

254
00:16:21.876 --> 00:16:22.492
&gt;&gt; Marcy: Good question.

255
00:16:22.492 --> 00:16:29.018
So for triple A,
that might be harder to get away with.

256
00:16:29.018 --> 00:16:29.806
I love these lines.

257
00:16:29.806 --> 00:16:34.532
So the lines,
the 4.5 is this lower line, and

258
00:16:34.532 --> 00:16:40.062
then if I drag it all the way
over to 7 to meet the 7 ratio,

259
00:16:40.062 --> 00:16:43.074
It's pretty noticeable.

260
00:16:43.074 --> 00:16:45.785
It's like a washed out orange-white, so

261
00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:50.414
I don't think I could get away with
that without people noticing [LAUGH].

262
00:16:50.414 --> 00:16:54.048
I shipped a feature doing exactly this,
like, last week,

263
00:16:54.048 --> 00:16:57.624
where I tweaked the colors just enough,
nobody noticed.

264
00:16:57.624 --> 00:17:02.188
So, sometimes that is the way to go and
tools like this.

265
00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:06.377
I mean, I think on the thing I was working
on, this color picker was not working and

266
00:17:06.377 --> 00:17:09.988
I sure missed it because it's
very helpful when it works.

267
00:17:09.988 --> 00:17:14.820
Otherwise, you're like changing the color
slightly in the direction you want on

268
00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:18.390
the regular like this color
picker without the ratio line and

269
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.838
then you have to go test
the value manually, and it sucks.

270
00:17:23.558 --> 00:17:28.992
So let's go over to Firefox, because we'll

271
00:17:28.992 --> 00:17:33.718
go see what's going on with the color.

272
00:17:33.718 --> 00:17:35.078
So they have the same orange.

273
00:17:35.078 --> 00:17:37.253
I don't really wanna sign in, but

274
00:17:37.253 --> 00:17:40.631
hopefully I can test this
color just in the dev tools.

275
00:17:40.631 --> 00:17:43.551
So I'm gonna inspect just
like I did in Chrome.

276
00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:47.765
And we've got the orange color,
some rotating animation,

277
00:17:47.765 --> 00:17:50.601
that is a little distracting.

278
00:17:50.601 --> 00:17:52.561
That is something we're
gonna talk about later.

279
00:17:52.561 --> 00:17:54.021
So I mentioned motion.

280
00:17:55.231 --> 00:17:56.541
Here's an example right here.

281
00:17:57.781 --> 00:18:01.001
So this color, there's a border Color and
a background color.

282
00:18:01.001 --> 00:18:05.445
So if I click on the white, it is
showing me that the contrast ratio for

283
00:18:05.445 --> 00:18:07.757
these buttons has an issue as well.

284
00:18:07.757 --> 00:18:12.902
So if click on this, so
it doesn't give me the line, but

285
00:18:12.902 --> 00:18:19.044
it does give me the like,
I can drag it around and change the color.

286
00:18:19.044 --> 00:18:22.493
When it's the background color
is the thing I would change,

287
00:18:22.493 --> 00:18:24.723
I might need to use other tools to do it,

288
00:18:24.723 --> 00:18:28.805
cuz it only gives me the ability to
drag around on the foreground color.

289
00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:33.805
But if you made the change for
the text on the other examples,

290
00:18:33.805 --> 00:18:38.645
maybe that same orange color would be
the fix here too, for the backgrounds.

291
00:18:39.956 --> 00:18:43.452
But this tool,
like if the Chrome one isn't working,

292
00:18:43.452 --> 00:18:48.240
Firefox sometimes can help a little bit
cuz at least the goal would be to give

293
00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:52.956
you a color picker that you can drag
around on, cuz it's pretty helpful.

294
00:18:55.246 --> 00:19:00.649
The Accessibility Inspector in
Firefox also, it has its own tab,

295
00:19:00.649 --> 00:19:05.410
and this is their
accessibility tree inspector.

296
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:09.716
so it's similar not exactly the sama
as chrome but it still gives you a lot

297
00:19:09.716 --> 00:19:13.540
of really great information if
you're a regular Firefox user.

298
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.680
And you could use X in Firefox as well.

299
00:19:19.654 --> 00:19:27.424
Cool, okay, so our other techniques
do a little bit of zooming.

300
00:19:28.664 --> 00:19:33.404
So I'm gonna close out my developer tools.

301
00:19:33.404 --> 00:19:38.794
And if I zoom way in to at least 200%,
I get some horizontal scrolling.

302
00:19:40.428 --> 00:19:42.038
That's not great.

303
00:19:42.038 --> 00:19:47.408
So that if the yea,
looks like the whole thing has that issue.

304
00:19:47.408 --> 00:19:51.528
So going past 200% can
be sort of ambitious.

305
00:19:51.528 --> 00:19:56.131
I think the requirement is 200% for
there's a mcag guideline for

306
00:19:56.131 --> 00:19:58.568
what's called reflow.

307
00:19:58.568 --> 00:20:03.999
And so this one would fail reflow,
I would say because it doesn't

308
00:20:03.999 --> 00:20:09.167
seem like it would be that
challenging to make this scale.

309
00:20:09.167 --> 00:20:12.977
Everything should just be responsive,
I don't know why it's not.

310
00:20:14.037 --> 00:20:15.877
But that's how I would test that one.

311
00:20:15.877 --> 00:20:19.606
I'm actually surprised that there was
an issue with that cuz that one's,

312
00:20:19.606 --> 00:20:22.406
if it's responsive,
usually that's just handled.

313
00:20:22.406 --> 00:20:25.817
You might find some anomalies
that are like little details, but

314
00:20:25.817 --> 00:20:29.726
that looked kind of major for
how their style sheets are set up.

315
00:20:29.726 --> 00:20:34.390
And with CSS Grid and Flexbox now,
you can just use modern tools and

316
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.146
have it apply for
those situations, it's awesome.
