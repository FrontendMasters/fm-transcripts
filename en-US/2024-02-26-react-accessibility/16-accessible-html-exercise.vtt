1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.093
All right, so
let's fix some code, shall we?

2
00:00:03.093 --> 00:00:06.417
If you haven't already
pulled down the project,

3
00:00:06.417 --> 00:00:11.100
this is gonna be our first example
where we really go dig into the code.

4
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.170
So let's pull this open,
we'll do a little bit of a tour here.

5
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.342
So, we're on Exercise 3, Fix Some HTML.

6
00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:27.662
I guess, before I go over here, I'll
show you what it is that we're fixing.

7
00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:31.221
So we have a product for a dog float coat,

8
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:37.572
in case you wanna go kayaking or
stand up paddling with your dog.

9
00:00:37.572 --> 00:00:41.438
They're gonna need a PFD, or
personal flotation device.

10
00:00:41.438 --> 00:00:46.136
So this product that maybe I buy
somebody's dog for Christmas or

11
00:00:46.136 --> 00:00:48.402
something has a product page.

12
00:00:48.402 --> 00:00:50.443
It's kind of in progress,

13
00:00:50.443 --> 00:00:55.858
it has a ton of components in it
that take a lot of time to build.

14
00:00:55.858 --> 00:01:01.895
But there's some varying degrees
of accessibility or not built in.

15
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:07.316
So our mission in this exercise is to
find as much that we can improve, while

16
00:01:07.316 --> 00:01:13.014
focused on the HTML part, we're gonna
build on this in the next few examples.

17
00:01:13.014 --> 00:01:17.415
But let's see if we can fix
some HTML that we find in here.

18
00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:20.798
So there's a little color picker.

19
00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:24.478
It's not totally hooked up to
the bigger image gallery yet, but

20
00:01:24.478 --> 00:01:26.946
it does have these little lists of images.

21
00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:29.550
We have a size picker.

22
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.322
There is the start of
a photo gallery here.

23
00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:35.235
So speaking of dialogs, that, hint, hint,

24
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:38.161
could be something that
we make into a dialog.

25
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:44.812
It's basically just the first attempt at
getting a layer to cover the content.

26
00:01:44.812 --> 00:01:50.832
So our approach for that, we are totally
open-ended, what we can do with that.

27
00:01:50.832 --> 00:01:55.647
That'll especially be later in
our focus management section.

28
00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:56.573
Let's see, what else.

29
00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:58.504
So we've got some buttons down here.

30
00:01:58.504 --> 00:02:00.700
We have a little quantity selector.

31
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.200
So, how are those marked up?

32
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.700
We can go look at those.

33
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.780
So there's some debugging tips on here.

34
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.458
So we want to look at keyboard controls,
so that's kind of in the realm of HTML,

35
00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:17.560
what elements are in there
that are accessible?

36
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.703
We'll get more advanced with
focus management a little later.

37
00:02:21.703 --> 00:02:27.516
But headings, landmarks, and accessible
names, those are all in the scope of this.

38
00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:34.270
So our form labels, or
any links, any image alt text.

39
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.033
And we can inspect the DOM and
run extensions.

40
00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:42.500
So this component is
embedded in this page,

41
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.947
so I can go in here and
inspect it and go check it out.

42
00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:53.547
There's also a full page,
not in the slide deck.

43
00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:59.176
And it is, I think this might be
the more complete version of it,

44
00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:01.273
if you wanna test that.

45
00:03:01.273 --> 00:03:04.124
And so there's one that's full screen.

46
00:03:06.413 --> 00:03:08.451
Okay, so
let's go see where this code lives.

47
00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:18.585
So ProductPage, that's the kinda top-level
page component that pulls in the header.

48
00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:20.037
There's an image gallery.

49
00:03:20.037 --> 00:03:25.590
So basically anything with the word
product in it, in the component names,

50
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.776
those are all going to affect
the component on that page.

51
00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:34.009
And it is sort of the first go-around for
these, so

52
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:39.561
it might not be quite as sophisticated
as the real site would have.

53
00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:42.451
But it has the start to
some of the functionality.

54
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:44.718
So there's the image gallery component.

55
00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:48.260
And if you're new to React,
so we have a lot of logic and

56
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.801
functions that are little utilities
that you can call up top.

57
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:54.855
There's a little bit
of TypeScript in here.

58
00:03:54.855 --> 00:03:56.762
And then if you scroll down,

59
00:03:56.762 --> 00:04:00.898
the JSX down below is basically
where all of our markup lives.

60
00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:04.567
And so the header has multiple
components in a file.

61
00:04:04.567 --> 00:04:12.028
There's the little banner up at the top,
that gets pulled into the product header,

62
00:04:12.028 --> 00:04:17.587
which is a little further down,
ProductDetails, and so on.

63
00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:21.431
And we'll go poke around in here and
make some changes.

64
00:04:21.431 --> 00:04:24.871
If you have any issues setting
up the project, let us know.

65
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:29.750
And then we'll come back and
code some fixes together.
