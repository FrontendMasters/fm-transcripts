00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.348
Let's move on, we're gonna talk
just briefly about other assistive

2
00:00:03.348 --> 00:00:07.890
technologies, and then we're gonna fire
up a screen reader and do some testing.

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.239
So there are other types of
assistive technologies and

4
00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:14.660
other content types that
I wanted to mention.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.224
So, I mean, even as simple as
things like eyeglasses and

6
00:00:18.224 --> 00:00:21.847
wheelchairs could be
considered assistive devices.

7
00:00:21.847 --> 00:00:25.767
But as I mentioned,
there's braille displays.

8
00:00:25.767 --> 00:00:28.237
If you're curious about those,

9
00:00:28.237 --> 00:00:33.892
I have a link in here about how braille
displays help users navigate the web.

10
00:00:33.892 --> 00:00:36.248
There's speech recognition and

11
00:00:36.248 --> 00:00:40.627
voice control using things
like Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

12
00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:44.331
There's also voice control for
iOS and MacOS, and

13
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:48.725
I have a link in here from my buddy,
this guy named Ian McKay,

14
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:53.224
who's a quadriplegic,
he's up in Washington where I live.

15
00:00:53.224 --> 00:00:58.245
And he does a lot of work with
Apple to improve their software for

16
00:00:58.245 --> 00:01:00.915
paraplegics, quadriplegics.

17
00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:04.262
And so, in this video that I've included,

18
00:01:04.262 --> 00:01:09.966
he talks about Apple accessibility,
his work with them and how he uses it.

19
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.991
And so, yeah, he powers his wheelchair,

20
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.529
he's got a smart home that
he uses voice control.

21
00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:20.378
So he's a real ambassador for
using technology,

22
00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:24.056
it's changed his life, he's super awesome.

23
00:01:24.056 --> 00:01:29.302
So yeah, once you learn how people use
technology, it becomes less of a mystery.

24
00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:34.406
It's like, well, yeah, of course,
we have to make it accessible,

25
00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:38.473
cuz then En can't use it, or
then, these are real people.

26
00:01:38.473 --> 00:01:44.402
So switch devices are another way that
people navigate either a mobile device or

27
00:01:44.402 --> 00:01:48.560
computer, so
you can have a limited number of keys, and

28
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.471
there's a video in here from
Rob Dodson on Ali Cass.

29
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.872
He talks more about switch devices,
screen magnification,

30
00:01:56.872 --> 00:02:01.779
as you mentioned earlier, you had to
fire it up yesterday to deal with

31
00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:05.437
a vision issue, and so
that's there all the time.

32
00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:10.031
We have screen magnification and
Zoom built into our platforms.

33
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:13.311
There's also third party software
with things like Zoom text.

34
00:02:15.181 --> 00:02:19.917
And just to sort of make sure we cover
this, just somewhere in the workshop,

35
00:02:19.917 --> 00:02:23.323
I wanted to mention transcripts and
closed captions.

36
00:02:23.323 --> 00:02:26.588
Cuz those are so critical for
people who are deaf or

37
00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:30.884
hard of hearing to follow along,
sort of a different approach.

38
00:02:30.884 --> 00:02:34.788
But both transcripts and
closed captions are critical,

39
00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:38.545
any time you have audio or media content.

40
00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:43.470
And then audio descriptions, which are
a little more related to people who use

41
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.655
screen readers, but
it's like alternative text for video.

42
00:02:47.655 --> 00:02:52.467
And so, if you watch Netflix or Hulu or
something when you watch a show, there

43
00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:57.794
are nonverbal things that happen in those
shows that if they could be described.

44
00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:02.651
With audio descriptions, you turn it on or
play an audio described version

45
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:07.446
of a video and it will read all of that
stuff aloud along with the dialogue.
