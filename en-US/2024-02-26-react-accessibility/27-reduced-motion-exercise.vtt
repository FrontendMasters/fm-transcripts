00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.386
We've got an example of some
auto-rotating announcements.

2
00:00:07.386 --> 00:00:11.672
I don't know about you, but that kind
of stuff just distracts me immediately.

3
00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:16.998
And so, for users that have cognitive
disabilities, seizure risk,

4
00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:22.340
it's not just annoying or distracting,
it can actually be harmful.

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.067
So for this we are going to
implement reduce motion on this.

6
00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:31.096
So I'm gonna go over to our example.

7
00:00:31.096 --> 00:00:33.306
That is in our product header.

8
00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:35.130
So we have this banner element.

9
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.213
It's got a should animate flag, so
that we can turn that on and off.

10
00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:46.027
Let's go up here to our banner element.

11
00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:50.420
So we already have some of
the code we need in here.

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.269
I think if we had a way to call
the user prefers reduced motion,

13
00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.207
we'd be able to control this.

14
00:00:59.207 --> 00:01:02.844
So we do happen to have a hook in here.

15
00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:08.554
This is a kind of a neatly packaged way
to call this usePrefersReduceMotion code.

16
00:01:08.554 --> 00:01:10.876
So we already have it in here.

17
00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:15.226
This is a React version, so
it uses React useEffect.

18
00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:21.454
That will call a bit of code after
the page loads as a side effect.

19
00:01:21.454 --> 00:01:27.491
And it will kind of allow us to call
window APIs and things in the browser.

20
00:01:27.491 --> 00:01:33.008
So this is matching,
this prefers-reduce-motion, no-preference.

21
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:37.977
We are keeping it in a state
variable of prefers reduce motion,

22
00:01:37.977 --> 00:01:42.944
and then returning that, so
I have that variable to hold on to so

23
00:01:42.944 --> 00:01:45.320
I can check what's going on.

24
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.890
And a hook like this is useful cuz I can
call it from various parts of my site or

25
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.989
my application.

26
00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.969
I don't have to include this
literally in every place.

27
00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:01.834
So it's got that change listener, it also
cleans up after itself when it's done.

28
00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:03.755
So let's pull this in.

29
00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:07.465
In our product header, we need that hook.

30
00:02:07.465 --> 00:02:11.636
So I'm going to import.

31
00:02:11.636 --> 00:02:13.533
And is it a default?

32
00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.286
Yes, usePrefersReduceMotion.

33
00:02:17.286 --> 00:02:18.646
Wow, thank you VS Code.

34
00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:21.125
It went found that for me.

35
00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:26.066
So where we wanna call this is any
place that we're calling inmate.

36
00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:28.759
So there's two places,

37
00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:34.146
there's an initial call
with this set time out and

38
00:02:34.146 --> 00:02:39.544
then on use effect,
it will just keep on running.

39
00:02:39.544 --> 00:02:43.537
I'm actually for time and energy purposes,

40
00:02:43.537 --> 00:02:47.751
let's look at the fully
implemented version.

41
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:53.944
So we can add a dependency on our
use effect when we call this.

42
00:02:53.944 --> 00:02:58.056
So if userPrefersReduceMotion,

43
00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:01.748
we'll make sure we have that.

44
00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:06.893
And then in animate, I'm going to go and
check whether that is true or false.

45
00:03:06.893 --> 00:03:12.977
So if the user hasn't said that
they prefer reduced motion,

46
00:03:12.977 --> 00:03:16.091
animate away, do your thing.

47
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:23.735
So let's go see, may be I can implement
this on our other one, other page.

48
00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:29.660
So on animate,
we have this userPrefersReducedMotion.

49
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.501
That variable is being called up here, so

50
00:03:33.501 --> 00:03:37.669
we pull in that hook,
store it in a variable,

51
00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.305
it already has its own
state managed internally.

52
00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:48.454
So now I have this user
prefersReduceMotion, and I can call it.

53
00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:53.106
Let's see if I really need to
add this to our dependencies.

54
00:03:53.106 --> 00:03:56.212
See what happens.

55
00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:57.345
I think it might have just worked.

56
00:03:57.345 --> 00:04:00.697
I'm going to open the console,

57
00:04:00.697 --> 00:04:05.049
make sure that we don't have any errors.

58
00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.994
But it was animating before, now it's not.

59
00:04:06.994 --> 00:04:11.471
So let's go turn off our setting,
see if it starts.

60
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:12.196
There it goes again.

61
00:04:14.984 --> 00:04:19.442
Sweet, so that is a very happy way of

62
00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:24.507
responding to prefers reduced motion.

63
00:04:24.507 --> 00:04:29.048
But use it for things like
animating carousels like this one,

64
00:04:29.048 --> 00:04:33.152
we saw one on the sound cloud
logged out homepage that had

65
00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:37.542
an auto-rotating carousel
that would benefit from this.

66
00:04:37.542 --> 00:04:41.960
So depending on where is
the animated code coming from,

67
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.353
you can control it with CSS or JavaScript.
