00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.870
We've got an example of some
auto -rotating announcements.

2
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.060
I don't know about you, but that kinda
stuff just distracts me immediately.

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.286
And so for users that have cognitive
disabilities, seizure risk,

4
00:00:17.286 --> 00:00:22.703
it's not just annoying or distracting,
it can actually be harmful.

5
00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:28.559
So for this, we are going to
implement reduce motion on this.

6
00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:29.969
So I'm gonna go over to our example.

7
00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.789
That is in our product header.

8
00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.175
So we have this banner element,
it's got a should animate flag so

9
00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:40.346
that we can turn that on and off.

10
00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:46.117
Let's go up here to our banner element.

11
00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:50.467
So we already have some of
the code we need in here.

12
00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:56.582
I think if we had a way to call
the userPrefersReducedMotion,

13
00:00:56.582 --> 00:00:59.707
we'd be able to control this.

14
00:00:59.707 --> 00:01:03.324
So, we do happen to have a hook in here.

15
00:01:03.324 --> 00:01:08.408
This is kind of a neatly packaged way to
call this use prefers reduced motion code,

16
00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:11.024
so we already have it in here.

17
00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:16.041
This is a React version, so
it uses React useEffect that

18
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:21.696
will call a bit of code after
the page loads as a side effect, and

19
00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:27.981
it will kinda allow us to call window
APIs and things in the browser.

20
00:01:27.981 --> 00:01:32.371
So this is matching this
prefersReduceMotion noPreference.

21
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:38.239
We are keeping it in a state
variable of prefersReduceMotion,

22
00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:43.173
and then returning that, so
I have that variable to hold on to, so

23
00:01:43.173 --> 00:01:45.819
I can check what's going on.

24
00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:50.369
And a hook like this is useful because I
can call it from various parts of my site

25
00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.449
or my application, I don't have to
include this literally in every place.

26
00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:59.445
So it's got that change listener, it also
cleans up after itself when it's done.

27
00:02:00.926 --> 00:02:03.856
So let's pull this in.

28
00:02:03.856 --> 00:02:07.966
In our product header, we need that hook.

29
00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:13.926
So I'm gonna import, and is it a default?

30
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:14.626
Yes.

31
00:02:15.756 --> 00:02:20.285
Use prefersReduceMotion, wow, thank you
VS Code, I went and found that for me.

32
00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:26.126
So where we wanna call this is any
place that we're calling animate,

33
00:02:26.126 --> 00:02:27.688
o there's two places.

34
00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:31.991
There's an initial call with
the setTimeout, and then on useEffect,

35
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:33.795
it will just keep on running.

36
00:02:33.795 --> 00:02:39.247
So I think what we wanna do,
I'm actually, for time and

37
00:02:39.247 --> 00:02:45.743
energy purposes, let's look at
the fully implemented version.

38
00:02:47.958 --> 00:02:54.444
So we can add a dependency on
our useEffect when we call this.

39
00:02:54.444 --> 00:02:57.562
So if userPrefersReduceMotion,

40
00:02:57.562 --> 00:03:02.291
we'll make sure we have that,
and then in animate,

41
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:07.348
I'm going to go and
check whether that is true or false.

42
00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:14.148
So if the user doesn't, hasn't said that
they prefer reduced motion, animate away.

43
00:03:14.148 --> 00:03:14.828
Do your thing.

44
00:03:16.548 --> 00:03:24.235
So let's go see, maybe I can implement
this on our other one, other page.

45
00:03:24.235 --> 00:03:29.603
So, on animate,
we have this userPrefersReducedMotion,

46
00:03:29.603 --> 00:03:35.179
that variable is being called up here,
so we pull in that hook,

47
00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:42.805
stored in a variable, it already has
its own state-managed internally.

48
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:47.333
So now I have this
userPrefersReduceMotion, and

49
00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:48.935
I can call it.

50
00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:54.498
Let's see if I really need to add this
to our dependencies, see what happens.

51
00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:57.965
I think it might have just worked.

52
00:03:59.045 --> 00:04:03.884
I'm gonna open the console,
make sure that we don't have any errors.

53
00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:07.494
But it was animating before, now it's not.

54
00:04:07.494 --> 00:04:11.944
So let's go turn off our setting,
see if it starts.

55
00:04:11.944 --> 00:04:12.795
There it goes again.

56
00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:15.814
Sweet.

57
00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:24.950
So that is a very happy way of
responding to PrefersReducedMotion.

58
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.490
But use it for things like
animating carousels like this one.

59
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.118
We saw one on the SoundCloud logged-out
home page that had an auto-rotating

60
00:04:35.118 --> 00:04:38.030
carousel that would benefit from this.

61
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.445
So depending on how, like where
is the animated code coming from?

62
00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:45.775
You can control it with CSS or JavaScript.
