00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.864
ARIA, like all this really cool stuff with
labeling and rules, there's another big

2
00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:08.553
topic within it that I think is some
of the coolest parts of ARIA, and

3
00:00:08.553 --> 00:00:11.330
that's what's called live regions.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.651
So live regions are made so that screen
reader users can be informed that

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:22.162
things are happening on the screen
without moving their keyboard focus.

6
00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:27.458
Imagine you're typing in a form
text area and it auto saves and

7
00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:32.072
there's a toast notification at
when you pause that says, saved.

8
00:00:32.072 --> 00:00:34.932
And you're like, cool, okay.

9
00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:36.436
I can kind of relax a little bit.

10
00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:40.670
I'm not gonna lose this opus when
I'm writing if something happens,

11
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.619
my page refreshes.

12
00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:46.684
If you can't see that toast,
it's elsewhere on the screen and

13
00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:50.685
we don't wanna move the user's
focus cuz they're flowing.

14
00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:54.279
We don't wanna disrupt
the writing process.

15
00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:57.889
How is a screen reader user going to
know that there was a notification?

16
00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:02.513
Well, there's a thing called live regions
that make it really easy to just pipe

17
00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:06.186
a message to the screen reader
without moving the focus at all.

18
00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:12.750
So there's a few different ways that we
can set these up, and these live regions

19
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.967
are helpful in many different contexts,
including client side routing,

20
00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:22.218
which we will also talk about
in enterprise accessibility.

21
00:01:22.218 --> 00:01:25.922
But we can set live regions
with two major levels.

22
00:01:25.922 --> 00:01:28.922
So there's assertive and polite.

23
00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:33.274
I think assertive maybe even was called
rude at one time because it will interrupt

24
00:01:33.274 --> 00:01:34.882
everything else.

25
00:01:34.882 --> 00:01:38.423
So if you have other announcements,
polite will wait and

26
00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:42.997
kind of slot into the queue of
announcements until other things are done,

27
00:01:42.997 --> 00:01:45.608
which for a lot of things is appropriate.

28
00:01:45.608 --> 00:01:49.235
But for things that are time sensitive,
like you are going

29
00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:53.840
to be logged out automatically or
alert, I guess alert would move focus.

30
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.460
But we sometimes need different
settings for different things.

31
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.592
So assertive and polite.

32
00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:03.143
So there's different
ways to set live regions.

33
00:02:04.263 --> 00:02:09.033
There's a role of status,
a role of log, a role of alert.

34
00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:12.933
Those are all the more polite,
chill versions of this.

35
00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:16.300
The more interrupty ones are, I guess,

36
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.173
role alert will interrupt and
the assertive.

37
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.068
So there's roles and aria-live attributes.

38
00:02:24.068 --> 00:02:27.185
aria-live polite is similar
to role status, role log.

39
00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:32.360
aria-live assertive is the same
level as the assertive.

40
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.500
So those will interrupt.

41
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.650
And these act as a message center.

42
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.800
So any element that has these roles or
aria-lives on them,

43
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.786
if you append any text to that element,
it will automatically read it.

44
00:02:44.786 --> 00:02:50.176
And we're gonna go add
one to our product page.

45
00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:53.863
So you can put a CSS class on these so
that they are rendered and

46
00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:57.386
they are read aloud,
but you don't see them.

47
00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:01.157
So the screen reader only class or
visually hidden class.

48
00:03:01.157 --> 00:03:06.123
Kind of a best practice to, these aren't
usually visual content, they're for

49
00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:07.227
screen readers.

50
00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:13.217
So to test them, the only real way
to test this is in a screen reader.

51
00:03:13.217 --> 00:03:17.806
So here's one case,
we had some questions understandably

52
00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:21.581
about how often do I need
to test screen readers?

53
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:24.647
If you're writing a live region,
you kind of have to,

54
00:03:24.647 --> 00:03:27.395
otherwise you're never
gonna hear the output.

55
00:03:28.905 --> 00:03:31.219
So that is one type of use case or

56
00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.365
feature that you will be firing
up the screen reader for.

57
00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:42.441
But a lot of the times I think testing
it in voice-over seems to be sufficient.

58
00:03:42.441 --> 00:03:46.068
Yeah, if you can test it on Windows,
that would be helpful.

59
00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:50.052
So there was question around
this topic that I saw about,

60
00:03:50.052 --> 00:03:52.799
can you play a sound with a live region?

61
00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.431
I think potentially you could,
but I don't think you'd want to.

62
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:04.078
I think the sound could interfere with
the text content since there's an order.

63
00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:07.750
I mean, talk about you have to
either interrupt other text or

64
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.269
it has to wait in a queue.

65
00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.659
So I don't think you'd wanna
interrupt anything with a sound.

66
00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.939
I guess if that was a really
compelling idea for

67
00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:20.852
your product, go test it with people.

68
00:04:20.852 --> 00:04:23.740
Create a prototype,
see if it will work for one,

69
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.297
see if it annoys the heck out
of people like I think it would.

70
00:04:27.297 --> 00:04:35.322
[LAUGH] So the big cautionary note
with live regions is don't overdo it.

71
00:04:35.322 --> 00:04:38.507
If divs are annoying,
live regions can be really,

72
00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:41.182
really annoying because they talk at you.

73
00:04:41.182 --> 00:04:45.872
And my favorite anecdote of live regions
is that there was a chat widget on a major

74
00:04:45.872 --> 00:04:50.426
social media site that there could be
multiple instances of the chat widget.

75
00:04:50.426 --> 00:04:53.768
And it was just automatically
announcing the time, five minutes ago,

76
00:04:53.768 --> 00:04:55.559
ten minutes ago, three minutes ago.

77
00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:58.089
Where's that coming from?

78
00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.099
It's from the chat widgets.

79
00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:02.315
So the automatic
announcement can go awry and

80
00:05:02.315 --> 00:05:05.959
end up being less helpful
than we think they would.

81
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.956
So we wanna use this sparingly.
