WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.566
It's time to come together and
see what we can fix for HTML problems.

2
00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:09.829
So these components had some
intentional things in there.

3
00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:13.086
I left some of them that
were working okay, but

4
00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:17.614
there's always improvements we
can make when it comes to HTML.

5
00:00:17.614 --> 00:00:23.649
So let's go look at this in a browser, and
I'm gonna identify some problems that way.

6
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.590
So going back over to Chrome,

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.130
we've got our product page here for
the K9 float coat.

8
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.584
So I'm gonna go inspect and
go and see what we have.

9
00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:41.463
So we do have a header,
there's a roll of banner and

10
00:00:41.463 --> 00:00:46.568
a header, which I happen to
know that you can only have

11
00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:51.576
one header roll banner,
there's only one banner.

12
00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:54.579
That is one of the rules around landmarks.

13
00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.230
So we'll probably have
to change one of those.

14
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.624
We've got a lot of divs.

15
00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:05.619
So just kind of at a glance when
I look at this content, and

16
00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.393
I'm actually gonna dock the dev tools over
on the right so you can see more of this.

17
00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:14.321
When I'm working on mobile viewport sizes,

18
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:17.642
I tend to put my dock off to
the side in the dev tools.

19
00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:24.338
So there's a lot of divs here, especially
when they should be repeated potentially.

20
00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:25.288
Let's see what these are.

21
00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:27.879
So these are the images
going down the screen.

22
00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.009
There's a group of those.

23
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.025
So really those should be in a list of
some kind so that in a screen reader,

24
00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:39.068
someone could find that there are six
images, or however many of those.

25
00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:45.822
If I go drill down into these surprise,
there's no alt text on these.

26
00:01:45.822 --> 00:01:50.108
And we had a great question
earlier about backend services and

27
00:01:50.108 --> 00:01:53.005
how those could support accessibility.

28
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.186
So if I'm getting my image
assets from the backend,

29
00:01:56.186 --> 00:02:00.759
it'd be great if I could consume all
texts at the same time on the frontend.

30
00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.823
I could plug that right into this
component and then these would be labeled.

31
00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:06.762
And let's see.

32
00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:07.549
What else?

33
00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.967
So some of these components,
there's a breadcrumb,

34
00:02:10.967 --> 00:02:15.364
the menu hasn't been built out yet,
but we do have some icon buttons.

35
00:02:15.364 --> 00:02:20.210
So let's go inspect some of those,
just seeing what's here on the page.

36
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.222
So these links just kind of going by
feature, I'm going to inspect these.

37
00:02:26.222 --> 00:02:32.600
I can see that the link does have some
text in it, it has an empty ARIA label,

38
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.875
but there is some screen
reader only text in here.

39
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:41.611
And so it can be helpful to look
at this in the accessibility dev

40
00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:46.364
tools to see is something actually
being generated and it is.

41
00:02:46.364 --> 00:02:49.745
So that seems to work okay.

42
00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:54.644
Further down the page,
we've got all these product details,

43
00:02:54.644 --> 00:02:59.275
so things like different colour
variants of this product.

44
00:02:59.275 --> 00:03:05.096
They do have alt text, but
they're within an aria hidden true region.

45
00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:09.919
So this particular image
is being suppressed,

46
00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:14.743
but that might not matter
too much because it's

47
00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:18.734
within a label with some radio inputs.

48
00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:22.262
And so
when I'm inspecting HTML in particular,

49
00:03:22.262 --> 00:03:26.648
I might do this way where I'm
looking at it in the dev tools and

50
00:03:26.648 --> 00:03:30.789
then going to fix things kind
of on a more targeted basis.

51
00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:34.274
You probably wouldn't do this flow for
an entire page, but

52
00:03:34.274 --> 00:03:38.050
sometimes I identify issues just
by looking at the source code.

53
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.408
So let's go do that.

54
00:03:39.408 --> 00:03:44.926
So, within our product details,
if I scroll down to some of our JSX code,

55
00:03:44.926 --> 00:03:48.575
that's where a lot of this
stuff is coming from.

56
00:03:48.575 --> 00:03:52.723
So, I see there's an H1 in here.

57
00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:58.093
This kind of top level element,
wait, I'm on product details.

58
00:03:58.093 --> 00:03:59.440
Let's go to product page.

59
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.782
That'll be the top level element for
this demo.

60
00:04:03.782 --> 00:04:08.075
So the demo is within the rest
of our slide materials, but

61
00:04:08.075 --> 00:04:11.384
the intent is to think
of it as its own thing,

62
00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:16.228
because that's what would end
up on a customer facing website.

63
00:04:16.228 --> 00:04:21.857
So kind of thinking of it that way,
our scope is really any accessibility

64
00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:27.211
issues that we might introduce by
treating this as its own document,

65
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:30.189
we just kind of ignore for the moment.

66
00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.523
But we need some landmarks in here,
I think.

67
00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:37.208
So looking at the page itself,

68
00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:42.746
I'm gonna close this and
just go look at this.

69
00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:45.338
So we've got our header
up here at the top,

70
00:04:45.338 --> 00:04:49.383
I think everything below the header
could go into a main landmark.

71
00:04:49.383 --> 00:04:54.986
And so that way we have this separation
between those regions of the page.

72
00:04:54.986 --> 00:04:59.844
This side content with the product title,
and reviews, and price,

73
00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:04.387
and everything, you might be
tempted to put that into an aside.

74
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.506
But if it's inside of a main element,
that's not gonna be top-level anymore.

75
00:05:08.506 --> 00:05:10.274
So we kind of have to choose.

76
00:05:10.274 --> 00:05:15.059
Main has to be top-level, meaning it's
not wrapped in any other landmarks.

77
00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:18.291
Aside also has to be top-level, so

78
00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:22.397
it might not be the right choice for
this one.

79
00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:27.435
Maybe it doesn't necessarily need
to be in a semantic landmark,

80
00:05:27.435 --> 00:05:29.277
we could use headings.

81
00:05:29.277 --> 00:05:32.205
Let's look at our headings tool.

82
00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:35.546
I don't think we've really seen that yet.

83
00:05:35.546 --> 00:05:39.914
For this page, I'm trying to
think of how I wanna do this.

84
00:05:39.914 --> 00:05:44.487
I think our example has stuff
fixed on it already, but

85
00:05:44.487 --> 00:05:47.444
let's look at this scope in here.

86
00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:51.705
I guess we could look at headings and
accessibility insights.

87
00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:57.117
So the completed example has h1 for
the product title and

88
00:05:57.117 --> 00:06:01.413
then h2 is for
these major parts of the page.

89
00:06:01.413 --> 00:06:06.660
And so that's way helpful when we went
from the example we're gonna go and

90
00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:12.342
look at and code, none of these are marked
up as headings, maybe they each one.

91
00:06:12.342 --> 00:06:15.409
But some of those subheadings
can be super useful.

92
00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:19.009
So in my other extensions,
one that I haven't shown you yet

93
00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.386
today is the web developer extension.

94
00:06:21.386 --> 00:06:27.204
It's for Chrome and Firefox,
it pops up this little menu of options.

95
00:06:27.204 --> 00:06:29.191
And under Information,

96
00:06:29.191 --> 00:06:35.064
View Document Outline is where we can
see our overall heading hierarchy.

97
00:06:35.064 --> 00:06:40.539
The headings map tool that was recommended
earlier today could do something similar.

98
00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.317
So it's really helpful to just
see the headings at a glance cuz

99
00:06:44.317 --> 00:06:49.053
when you're going to choose what heading
level, that can be super helpful.

100
00:06:49.053 --> 00:06:53.977
Also, just looking at the page,
what are the major parts

101
00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:58.094
of this page that would
benefit from headings?

102
00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:01.175
And what levels of those need to be so

103
00:07:01.175 --> 00:07:04.886
that they kind of fall
in a nice hierarchy.

104
00:07:04.886 --> 00:07:07.696
So let's go fix some of those.

105
00:07:07.696 --> 00:07:14.633
So within this component,
we've got the product header.

106
00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:20.511
I think a lot of those headings over on
the right side are within product details.

107
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:21.635
So let's go look at that.

108
00:07:21.635 --> 00:07:25.273
That's where the product title comes from.

109
00:07:25.273 --> 00:07:29.431
It's got the company name, so
it's who makes the product, and

110
00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:31.510
then the product title itself.

111
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:36.482
We've got ratings, which I guess one
technique I could share with you is if you

112
00:07:36.482 --> 00:07:41.376
have a region of a page that conceptually
seems like it should have a heading,

113
00:07:41.376 --> 00:07:46.151
but there isn't one in the design,
you can add visually hidden headings.

114
00:07:46.151 --> 00:07:47.205
That is a thing.

115
00:07:47.205 --> 00:07:51.548
So for this example,
if I wanted to add an h2 for

116
00:07:51.548 --> 00:07:56.433
reviews and that would,
if we go back to our example,

117
00:07:56.433 --> 00:08:00.245
so now we have this reviews heading here.

118
00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:05.284
If I wanted that to be rendered so a
screen reader user would benefit from it,

119
00:08:05.284 --> 00:08:09.635
but I hide it visually, I can put
a screen reader only class on it.

120
00:08:09.635 --> 00:08:14.855
So in React,
I would say clasName is sr-only.

121
00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:18.375
That's a tailwind utility class.

122
00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:21.884
It works really similarly to
other visually hidden classes.

123
00:08:21.884 --> 00:08:24.258
And in React,
class name will become class.

124
00:08:24.258 --> 00:08:26.903
That's what gets rendered.

125
00:08:26.903 --> 00:08:28.879
So that way, if I hit Save here,

126
00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:33.878
let's see if there's a few others we can
fix before going back over the browser.

127
00:08:33.878 --> 00:08:35.710
So here's one for pricing.

128
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.129
So there's some spans,
it's wrapped in a div.

129
00:08:40.129 --> 00:08:44.611
I can select a tag name, and
then if I want to get the closing tag,

130
00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:50.343
there's no divs in between here and there,
so I could do Command D to select both.

131
00:08:50.343 --> 00:08:51.563
Change that to h2.

132
00:08:51.563 --> 00:08:56.224
So that gets the price one, quantity.

133
00:08:56.224 --> 00:09:01.987
So this is a paragraph, but that would
Make for a good heading as well.

134
00:09:01.987 --> 00:09:05.265
I'm gonna keep it at the same
level as the previous headings,

135
00:09:05.265 --> 00:09:07.672
and I'm just doing all
the headings at once.

136
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:12.780
So I think there's one more in the buy box

137
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.747
variant selector that would be color.

138
00:09:17.747 --> 00:09:22.193
So what are the colors that
are available or which one's selected?

139
00:09:22.193 --> 00:09:24.587
So now we've got some h2s.

140
00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:29.495
That review heading that we added that
was visually hidden, it's in there, but

141
00:09:29.495 --> 00:09:30.588
we don't see it.

142
00:09:30.588 --> 00:09:35.131
So now I can run
the View Document Outline tool,

143
00:09:35.131 --> 00:09:39.114
it's gonna show us the whole slide page.

144
00:09:39.114 --> 00:09:44.677
But under the Ruffwear K9 float coat,
now we have, we have headings.

145
00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:46.870
I screwed one up or maybe two.

146
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:54.251
[LAUGH] So I wanted one for the price,
for the color, quantity, and size.

147
00:09:54.251 --> 00:09:56.021
So yeah, I don't think I quite nailed it.

148
00:09:56.021 --> 00:09:57.189
Let's go see what we did.

149
00:09:57.189 --> 00:10:01.066
So color, that was selected color.

150
00:10:01.066 --> 00:10:07.384
[COUGH] I think I actually want it
on where the color options are.

151
00:10:08.896 --> 00:10:12.796
So maybe let me look at the frontend,
that's always helpful.

152
00:10:12.796 --> 00:10:17.838
So color probably just this
first part could be the heading.

153
00:10:17.838 --> 00:10:23.303
And since I'm using a lot of CSS grid and
Flexbox, I can make these sit on the same

154
00:10:23.303 --> 00:10:28.456
line next to each other even though
the heading is a block-level element.

155
00:10:28.456 --> 00:10:32.717
So just because it's sitting next to
something visually doesn't mean that I

156
00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:35.544
can't use a block-level
element like a heading.

157
00:10:35.544 --> 00:10:40.264
So I'm gonna change the wrapping
element on that one back to a div,

158
00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:42.470
and I will make just the color.

159
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:48.358
What was a span that
might affect the display?

160
00:10:48.358 --> 00:10:52.011
So if I needed to change
the layout of this,

161
00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:56.785
I could say flex using tailwind and
I could say flex row.

162
00:10:59.385 --> 00:11:02.002
And that should keep
them next to each other.

163
00:11:02.002 --> 00:11:02.950
See how we do.

164
00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.418
I think there was one on price
that I didn't get quite right,

165
00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:09.796
so let's go check that one out.

166
00:11:09.796 --> 00:11:14.280
It ended up being on the price itself,
not on the word price.

167
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.068
Do we even have the word?

168
00:11:16.068 --> 00:11:18.748
I think this is another one we
have to add a heading, actually.

169
00:11:18.748 --> 00:11:24.480
So I might change that one back and

170
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.047
go h2 className sr-only and price.

171
00:11:31.047 --> 00:11:35.847
So now it looks the same, cool,
and our little layout fix to

172
00:11:35.847 --> 00:11:40.552
get these to sit next to each
other appears to have worked.

173
00:11:40.552 --> 00:11:45.510
And the document outline tool,
I have to relaunch it every time.

174
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.529
So I can't refresh, I wish I could.

175
00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:53.078
So view document outline, so
now it's looking a little bit better.

176
00:11:53.078 --> 00:11:55.466
We have one that has a colon on it, so

177
00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:59.937
either I could make them all have
colons or just not worry about it.

178
00:11:59.937 --> 00:12:03.716
I don't think the colon will
really be announced at all,

179
00:12:03.716 --> 00:12:07.429
it's just like a visual detail,
not super important.

180
00:12:07.429 --> 00:12:12.471
So the debugging tips one is part
of the slide headings around it.

181
00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:14.704
So our content within our little demo,

182
00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:18.032
we've gotten our our heading
structure looking better.

183
00:12:19.931 --> 00:12:21.041
Let's see what else we can fix.

184
00:12:21.041 --> 00:12:25.879
So at this point,
I think our slide window with everything

185
00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:30.333
around the demo had zero
accessibility violations.

186
00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:34.166
So if we have any in the demo,
we should be able to surface just those.

187
00:12:34.166 --> 00:12:37.663
So I'm gonna go over to axe DevTools.

188
00:12:37.663 --> 00:12:42.297
Let's see what kind of
HTML issues it pulls up.

189
00:12:42.297 --> 00:12:48.724
So we have ARIA hidden on elements
that it contains focusable elements.

190
00:12:48.724 --> 00:12:51.527
So that will be a good one to dig into.

191
00:12:51.527 --> 00:12:57.204
I'm gonna put this on the bottom so
we can read it a little bit better.

192
00:12:57.204 --> 00:12:59.897
So ARIA hidden we need to look at,

193
00:12:59.897 --> 00:13:04.245
we have some buttons that
don't have labels on them.

194
00:13:04.245 --> 00:13:06.289
Let's go inspect with that is.

195
00:13:06.289 --> 00:13:10.502
Our menu button, so
that one's pretty important.

196
00:13:10.502 --> 00:13:15.451
It's got some SVG in it that is
not labeled, we can fix that.

197
00:13:15.451 --> 00:13:18.699
I think I think our cart
button's probably fine.

198
00:13:18.699 --> 00:13:24.238
So if you see a result has a number,
there are multiple issues there.

199
00:13:24.238 --> 00:13:29.120
So if I use these little buttons, and
I hit Highlight, I can go to the next one.

200
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.377
So our little quantity selector,
the plus and

201
00:13:33.377 --> 00:13:37.427
minus buttons need labels, both of those.

202
00:13:37.427 --> 00:13:41.978
ARIA hidden issue that
I sort of skipped by,

203
00:13:41.978 --> 00:13:47.024
that is our announcement
carousel up at the top.

204
00:13:47.024 --> 00:13:49.721
So the technique that was used for
that to try and

205
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:53.846
hide the content that's not currently
being shown, it has links in it.

206
00:13:53.846 --> 00:13:57.421
So we have to go and
change that a little bit.

207
00:13:57.421 --> 00:14:02.469
Let's see what else is in here.

208
00:14:02.469 --> 00:14:07.451
We're missing some alt text for
some of the product images,

209
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:09.607
there's seven of those.

210
00:14:09.607 --> 00:14:13.143
And then we're missing a form label on,

211
00:14:13.143 --> 00:14:18.239
let's see what that was,
more on the quantity selector.

212
00:14:18.239 --> 00:14:21.087
All right,
how about some rapid-fire fixing?

213
00:14:21.087 --> 00:14:24.098
[LAUGH] Let's see how many we can fix.

214
00:14:24.098 --> 00:14:29.922
Okay, so the BuyBoxVariantSelector
has the adding and subtracting,

215
00:14:29.922 --> 00:14:35.173
I believe, or is it in,
I have to remember where everything is.

216
00:14:37.324 --> 00:14:41.019
I think it's actually
in the product details.

217
00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:44.414
So here we go, decrement product count.

218
00:14:44.414 --> 00:14:49.914
So we could say for the remove,
we could say remove one.

219
00:14:49.914 --> 00:14:54.563
On the Add button, we could say Add one.

220
00:14:54.563 --> 00:14:58.022
And if you had internationalization,
it was kind concern.

221
00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:01.842
You could customize how
these labels are generated.

222
00:15:01.842 --> 00:15:06.725
I guess that could be something from if
you're consuming assets from the backend,

223
00:15:06.725 --> 00:15:11.343
if there's other languages, or I guess
depending on your strategy for that.

224
00:15:11.343 --> 00:15:15.815
But that is a whole other side of
things that we are not gonna get

225
00:15:15.815 --> 00:15:17.627
too deep into right now.

226
00:15:17.627 --> 00:15:23.467
So our input for
that quantity needed a label as well.

227
00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:26.241
So we've talked a lot
about the label element.

228
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:31.526
The ARIA label attribute can
work fine on form controls.

229
00:15:31.526 --> 00:15:37.151
I think sometimes there's a real
preference for text that's on screen.

230
00:15:37.151 --> 00:15:40.896
If you can show text in a label,
do that first.

231
00:15:40.896 --> 00:15:46.768
But just know that for screen reader
purposes, we can use ARIA label also.

232
00:15:46.768 --> 00:15:51.558
So for this one, I guess quantity,

233
00:15:51.558 --> 00:15:56.359
it's under a heading of quantity.

234
00:15:56.359 --> 00:16:00.571
Maybe product count, that's the value.

235
00:16:00.571 --> 00:16:04.471
So it kinda takes some inspiration
from the variable name.

236
00:16:04.471 --> 00:16:07.245
So that will describe
what the field is for and

237
00:16:07.245 --> 00:16:12.142
then the actual value like these ARIA
things will describe what's the number.

238
00:16:12.142 --> 00:16:15.160
How many items are in there?

239
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.430
So that should work.

240
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:21.730
I know we had some issues in our header,
so let's go up there.

241
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.789
That's under ProductHeader.

242
00:16:24.789 --> 00:16:30.735
We had two banner, two headers, basically.

243
00:16:30.735 --> 00:16:35.240
So there's this header element,
and then within banner,

244
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.403
which I'm gonna scroll roll up to get to.

245
00:16:38.403 --> 00:16:40.916
This one also has roll banner, okay?

246
00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:43.350
Well, which one do we wanna keep?

247
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:47.630
I think the one that wraps
everything that looks like a header,

248
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:51.279
I think this one could
potentially go in that header.

249
00:16:51.279 --> 00:16:56.943
But if we really wanted to give it a
region or some sort of sectioning element,

250
00:16:56.943 --> 00:17:00.967
we could say role region and
then we can give it a label.

251
00:17:00.967 --> 00:17:07.423
So this already had an aria-labeledby
pointing to this hidden paragraph.

252
00:17:07.423 --> 00:17:12.829
So kinda an interesting detail about
aria-labeledby is that it will still

253
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:18.941
connect a label on another element even if
that element is hidden with display none.

254
00:17:18.941 --> 00:17:22.146
So we'll learn more about
ARIA a little bit later.

255
00:17:22.146 --> 00:17:23.409
Okay, so we fixed that.

256
00:17:23.409 --> 00:17:27.964
I know we've got our Menu
button had issues, wait.

257
00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:32.666
We have a, let's say, previous slide.

258
00:17:32.666 --> 00:17:35.383
Maybe that one wasn't coming up,
but I know it's an issue.

259
00:17:35.383 --> 00:17:39.380
So next slide, that one had a label.

260
00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:44.577
Down in our header,
we had a Menu button missing a label.

261
00:17:44.577 --> 00:17:50.150
I think the shopping cart had this
text within the link, so it was fine.

262
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:52.913
This empty ARIA label,
we could just delete.
