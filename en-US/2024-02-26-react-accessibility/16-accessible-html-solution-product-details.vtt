WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:06.156
It's time to come together and
see what we can fix for HTML problems.

2
00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:10.052
So these components had some
intentional things in there.

3
00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:13.337
I left some of them that
were working okay, but

4
00:00:13.337 --> 00:00:17.901
there's always improvements we
can make when it comes to HTML.

5
00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:23.957
So let's go look at this in a browser, and
I'm gonna identify some problems that way.

6
00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.920
So going back over to Chrome,

7
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.497
we've got our product page here for
the K9 Float Coat.

8
00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:36.925
So I'm gonna go inspect and
go and see what we have.

9
00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:41.999
So we do have a header,
there's a roll of banner and

10
00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:49.800
a header, which I happen to know that you
can only have one header roll banner.

11
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.774
There's only one banner.

12
00:00:51.774 --> 00:00:55.650
That is one of the rules around landmarks,
so

13
00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.529
we'll probably have to
change one of those.

14
00:00:59.529 --> 00:01:05.176
We've got a lot of divs, so just kind of
at a glance when I look at this content.

15
00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:09.803
And I'm actually gonna dock
the DevTools over on the right so

16
00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.534
I can see more of this.

17
00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:14.521
When I'm working on mobile viewport sizes,

18
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:17.910
I tend to put my dock off to
the side in the DevTools.

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.812
So there's a lot of divs here, especially
when they should be repeated potentially.

20
00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:25.709
Let's see what these are.

21
00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:29.161
So these are the images going down
the screen, there's a group of those.

22
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:34.651
So really, those should be in a list
of some kind so that in a screen reader

23
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:40.143
someone could find that there are six
images, or however many of those.

24
00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:46.005
If I go drill down into these,
surprise, there's no alt text on these.

25
00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:50.373
And we had a great question
earlier about backend services and

26
00:01:50.373 --> 00:01:53.318
how those could support accessibility.

27
00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:56.499
So if I'm getting my image
assets from the backend,

28
00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:01.075
it'd be great if I could consume all
texts at the same time on the frontend.

29
00:02:01.075 --> 00:02:06.074
I could plug that right into this
component and then these would be labeled.

30
00:02:06.074 --> 00:02:07.725
And let's see, what else?

31
00:02:07.725 --> 00:02:11.181
So some of these components,
there's a breadcrumb,

32
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:15.623
the menu hasn't been built out yet,
but we do have some icon buttons.

33
00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:20.192
So let's go inspect some of those,
just seeing what's here on the page.

34
00:02:20.192 --> 00:02:26.498
So these links, just kind of going by
feature, I'm going to inspect these.

35
00:02:26.498 --> 00:02:31.760
I can see that the link
does have some text in it.

36
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.228
It has an empty array label, but there
is some screen reader only text in here.

37
00:02:37.228 --> 00:02:42.169
And so it can be helpful to look at
this in the accessibility DevTools

38
00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.433
to see is something actually
being generated, and it is.

39
00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:50.494
So that seems to work okay.

40
00:02:50.494 --> 00:02:55.316
Further down the page,
we've got all these product details, so

41
00:02:55.316 --> 00:02:59.449
things like different color
variants of this product.

42
00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:05.322
They do have alt text, but
they're within an ARIA hidden true region.

43
00:03:05.322 --> 00:03:10.095
So this particular image
is being suppressed,

44
00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:14.869
but that might not matter
too much because it's

45
00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:18.825
within a label with some radio inputs.

46
00:03:18.825 --> 00:03:23.724
And so when I'm inspecting HTML in
particular, I might do this way,

47
00:03:23.724 --> 00:03:26.765
where I'm looking at
it in the DevTools and

48
00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:30.837
then going to fix things kind
of on a more targeted basis.

49
00:03:30.837 --> 00:03:34.511
You probably wouldn't do this flow for
an entire page, but

50
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:38.493
sometimes I identify issues just
by looking at the source code.

51
00:03:38.493 --> 00:03:41.304
So let's go do that.

52
00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:45.967
So within our product details,
if I scroll down to some of our JSX code,

53
00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:49.176
that's where a lot of this
stuff is coming from.

54
00:03:49.176 --> 00:03:53.000
So I see there's an h1 here.

55
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.900
This kind of top level element,
wait, I'm on ProductDetails,

56
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.821
let's go to ProductPage.

57
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:04.147
That'll be the top level element for
this demo.

58
00:04:04.147 --> 00:04:08.281
So the demo is within the rest
of our slide materials, but

59
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:13.275
the kind of the intent is to think of
it as its own thing cuz that's what

60
00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:16.567
we'd end up on a customer-facing website.

61
00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:22.164
So kind of thinking of it that way,
our scope is really any accessibility

62
00:04:22.164 --> 00:04:27.487
issues that we might introduce by
treating this as its own document,

63
00:04:27.487 --> 00:04:30.457
we just kind of ignore for the moment.

64
00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:33.820
But we need some landmarks in here,
I think.

65
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.529
So looking at the page itself,

66
00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.101
I'm gonna close this and
just go look at this.

67
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:46.084
So we've got our header
up here at the top.

68
00:04:46.084 --> 00:04:49.734
I think everything below the header
could go into a main landmark.

69
00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:55.296
And so that way, we have this separation
between those regions of the page.

70
00:04:55.296 --> 00:05:00.246
This side content with the product
title and reviews and price and

71
00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:04.848
everything, you might be tempted
to put that into an aside.

72
00:05:04.848 --> 00:05:08.813
But if it's inside of a main element,
that's not gonna be top level anymore.

73
00:05:08.813 --> 00:05:12.728
So we kind of have to choose,
main has to be top level,

74
00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:16.911
meaning it's not wrapped in
any other landmarks aside.

75
00:05:16.911 --> 00:05:22.681
Also has to be top level, so it might
not be the right choice for this one.

76
00:05:22.681 --> 00:05:28.138
Maybe it does not necessarily need
to be in a semantic landmark,

77
00:05:28.138 --> 00:05:30.165
we could use headings.

78
00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:35.788
Let us look at our Headings tool,
I don't think we've really seen that yet.

79
00:05:35.788 --> 00:05:40.551
For this page, I am trying to
think of how I wanna do this,

80
00:05:40.551 --> 00:05:45.021
I think our example has stuff
fixed on it already, but

81
00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:47.921
let's look at this scope in here.

82
00:05:47.921 --> 00:05:52.040
I guess we could look at Headings
in Accessibility Insights.

83
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.241
So the completed example has h1 for
the product title,

84
00:05:57.241 --> 00:06:01.675
and then h2s for
these major parts of the page.

85
00:06:01.675 --> 00:06:06.610
And so that's way helpful,
the example we're gonna go and

86
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.648
look at in code, none of these
are marked up as headings, maybe the h1.

87
00:06:12.648 --> 00:06:15.784
But some of those subheadings
can be super useful.

88
00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:19.292
So in my other extensions,
one that I haven't shown you yet

89
00:06:19.292 --> 00:06:21.619
today is the Web Developer extension.

90
00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:27.390
It's for Chrome and Firefox,
it pops up this little menu of options.

91
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.032
And under Information &gt;
View Document Outline is where we

92
00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:35.260
can see our overall heading hierarchy.

93
00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:40.729
The HeadingsMap tool that was recommended
earlier today could do something similar.

94
00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:44.414
So it's really helpful to just
see the headings at a glance,

95
00:06:44.414 --> 00:06:49.343
cuz when you're going to choose what
heading level, that can be super helpful.

96
00:06:49.343 --> 00:06:52.172
Also, just looking at the page,

97
00:06:52.172 --> 00:06:58.245
what are the major parts of this page
that would benefit from headings?

98
00:06:58.245 --> 00:07:01.462
And what levels of those need to be so

99
00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:05.339
that they kind of fall
in a nice hierarchy?

100
00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:08.107
So let's go fix some of those.

101
00:07:08.107 --> 00:07:14.950
So within this component,
we've got the ProductHeader.

102
00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.611
I think a lot of those headings over on
the right side are within ProductDetails.

103
00:07:20.611 --> 00:07:22.672
So let's go look at that.

104
00:07:22.672 --> 00:07:25.582
That's where the productTitle comes from.

105
00:07:25.582 --> 00:07:29.729
It's got the companyName, so
it's like who makes the product, and

106
00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:31.671
then the productTitle itself.

107
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:36.736
We've got ratings, which I guess one
technique I could share with you is if you

108
00:07:36.736 --> 00:07:41.724
have a region of a page that conceptually
seems like it should have a heading,

109
00:07:41.724 --> 00:07:46.592
but there isn't one in the design,
you can add visually hidden headings.

110
00:07:46.592 --> 00:07:47.583
That is a thing.

111
00:07:47.583 --> 00:07:52.345
So for this example,
if I wanted to add an h2 for

112
00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:56.512
Reviews, if we go back to our example, so

113
00:07:56.512 --> 00:08:00.454
now we have this Reviews heading here.

114
00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:05.363
If I wanted that to be rendered so a
screen reader user would benefit from it,

115
00:08:05.363 --> 00:08:09.906
but I've hide it visually, I can put
a screen reader only class on it.

116
00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:15.310
So in React,
I would say className is sr-only.

117
00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:18.310
That's a tail-end utility class.

118
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.475
It works really similarly to
other visually hidden classes.

119
00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:27.135
And in React, className will become class,
that's what gets rendered.

120
00:08:27.135 --> 00:08:29.133
So that way, if I hit Save here,

121
00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:34.323
let's see if there's a few others we can
fix before going back over to the browser.

122
00:08:34.323 --> 00:08:35.970
So here's one for pricing.

123
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.456
So there's some spans,
it's wrapped in a div.

124
00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:44.929
I can select a tag name, and
then if I wanna get the closing tag,

125
00:08:44.929 --> 00:08:50.601
there's no divs in between here and there,
so I could do Cmd+D to select both.

126
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:56.491
Change that to h2, so
that gets the price 1 quantity.

127
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:02.095
So this is a paragraph, but that would
make for a good heading as well.

128
00:09:02.095 --> 00:09:05.644
I'm gonna keep it at the same level
as the previous headings, and

129
00:09:05.644 --> 00:09:07.912
I'm just doing all the headings at once.

130
00:09:07.912 --> 00:09:15.272
So I think there's one more
in the BuyBoxVariantSelector,

131
00:09:15.272 --> 00:09:17.877
that would be color.

132
00:09:17.877 --> 00:09:22.492
So what are the colors that are available,
or which one's selected?

133
00:09:22.492 --> 00:09:25.017
So now we've got some h2s.

134
00:09:25.017 --> 00:09:29.742
That review heading that we added that
was visually hidden is in there, but

135
00:09:29.742 --> 00:09:30.874
we don't see it.

136
00:09:30.874 --> 00:09:35.285
So now I can run
the View Document Outline tool,

137
00:09:35.285 --> 00:09:39.156
it's gonna show us the whole slide page.

138
00:09:39.156 --> 00:09:44.910
But under the Ruffwear K9 Float Coat,
we have headings.

139
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.949
I screwed one up, or maybe two.

140
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:54.439
[LAUGH] So I wanted one for the price,
for the color, quantity, and size.

141
00:09:54.439 --> 00:09:56.319
So yeah, I don't think I quite nailed it.

142
00:09:56.319 --> 00:09:58.494
Let's go see what we did.

143
00:09:58.494 --> 00:10:01.276
So Color, that was selected color.

144
00:10:01.276 --> 00:10:06.688
[COUGH] I think I actually want
it where the color options are.

145
00:10:09.145 --> 00:10:13.050
So maybe let me look at the front-end,
that's always helpful.

146
00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:18.025
So Color, probably just this
first part could be the heading.

147
00:10:18.025 --> 00:10:23.461
And since I'm using a lot of CSS grid and
Flexbox, I can make these sit on the same

148
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:28.758
line next to each other, even though
the heading is a block-level element.

149
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:32.970
So just because it's sitting next to
something visually doesn't mean that

150
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:35.881
I can't use a block-level
element like a heading.

151
00:10:35.881 --> 00:10:41.769
So I'm gonna change the wrapping
element on that one back to a div,

152
00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:48.407
and I will make just the color what was
a span that might affect the display.

153
00:10:48.407 --> 00:10:53.275
So if I needed to change the layout
of this, I could say flex,

154
00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:56.914
using tailwind, and I could say flex-row.

155
00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:04.230
And that should keep them next
to each other, see how we do.

156
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:08.099
I think there was one on price
that I didn't get quite right, so

157
00:11:08.099 --> 00:11:09.925
let's go check that one out.

158
00:11:09.925 --> 00:11:14.612
It ended up being on the price itself,
not on the word price.

159
00:11:14.612 --> 00:11:16.850
Do we even have the word?

160
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.115
I think this is another one we
have to add heading, actually.

161
00:11:19.115 --> 00:11:24.223
So I might change that one back and

162
00:11:24.223 --> 00:11:30.436
go h2 className= sr-only and Price.

163
00:11:30.436 --> 00:11:34.916
So now, it looks the same, cool.

164
00:11:34.916 --> 00:11:39.813
And our little layout fix to get these
to sit next to each other appears to

165
00:11:39.813 --> 00:11:40.800
have worked.

166
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:45.392
And the Document Outline tool,
I have to relaunch it every time so

167
00:11:45.392 --> 00:11:46.904
that it can refresh.

168
00:11:46.904 --> 00:11:47.500
I wish I could.

169
00:11:49.535 --> 00:11:53.295
So View Document Outline, so
now it's looking a little bit better.

170
00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:55.935
We have one that has a colon on it, so

171
00:11:55.935 --> 00:12:00.874
either I could make them all have
colons or just not worry about it.

172
00:12:00.874 --> 00:12:04.352
I don't think the colon will
really be announced at all,

173
00:12:04.352 --> 00:12:07.767
it's just like a visual detail,
not super important.

174
00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:12.741
So the debugging tips, one is part
of the slide headings around it.

175
00:12:12.741 --> 00:12:15.786
So our content within our little demo,

176
00:12:15.786 --> 00:12:20.036
we've gotten our heading
structure looking better.

177
00:12:20.036 --> 00:12:21.465
Let's see what else we can fix.

178
00:12:21.465 --> 00:12:26.229
So at this point,
I think our slide window with everything

179
00:12:26.229 --> 00:12:30.619
around the demo had zero
accessibility violations.

180
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:34.475
So if we have any in the demo,
we should be able to surface just those.

181
00:12:34.475 --> 00:12:37.025
So I'm gonna go over to axe DevTools,

182
00:12:37.025 --> 00:12:40.224
let's see what kind of
HTML issues it pulls up.

183
00:12:42.497 --> 00:12:48.994
So we have ARIA hidden,
it contains focusable elements.

184
00:12:48.994 --> 00:12:52.635
So that'll be a good one to dig into.

185
00:12:52.635 --> 00:12:57.467
I'm gonna put this on the bottom so
we can read it a little bit better.

186
00:12:57.467 --> 00:13:00.262
So ARIA hidden, we need to look at,

187
00:13:00.262 --> 00:13:04.470
we have some buttons that
don't have labels in them.

188
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:09.080
Let's go inspect what that is,
our Menu button.

189
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.616
So that one's pretty important, it's
got some SVG in it that is not labeled.

190
00:13:14.616 --> 00:13:17.298
We can fix that.

191
00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:18.962
I think our Cart button is probably fine.

192
00:13:18.962 --> 00:13:24.450
So if you see a result has a number,
there are multiple issues there.

193
00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:29.406
So if I use these little buttons, and
I hit Highlight, I can go to the next one.

194
00:13:29.406 --> 00:13:33.642
So our little quantity selector,
the plus and

195
00:13:33.642 --> 00:13:37.669
minus buttons need labels, both of those.

196
00:13:37.669 --> 00:13:43.205
Are the ARIA hidden issue
that I sort of skipped by.

197
00:13:43.205 --> 00:13:47.293
That is our announcement
carousel up at the top.

198
00:13:47.293 --> 00:13:50.001
So the technique that was used for
that to try and

199
00:13:50.001 --> 00:13:54.146
hide the content that's not currently
being shown, it has links in it.

200
00:13:54.146 --> 00:14:00.520
So we have to go and
change that a little bit.

201
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.642
Let's see what else is in here.

202
00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:07.494
We're missing some alt text for
some of the product images.

203
00:14:07.494 --> 00:14:13.295
There's seven of those, and
then we're missing a form label on,

204
00:14:13.295 --> 00:14:18.386
let's see what that was,
more on the quantity selector.

205
00:14:18.386 --> 00:14:21.352
All right,
how about some rapid-fire fixing?

206
00:14:21.352 --> 00:14:24.359
[LAUGH] Let's see how many we can fix.

207
00:14:24.359 --> 00:14:29.229
Okay, so the BuyBox Variant Selector
has the adding and

208
00:14:29.229 --> 00:14:35.141
subtracting, I believe,
I have to remember where everything is.

209
00:14:37.594 --> 00:14:41.273
I think it's actually
in the ProductDetails.

210
00:14:41.273 --> 00:14:44.717
So below that, so here we go,
decrementProductCount.

211
00:14:44.717 --> 00:14:50.189
So we could say for the remove,
we could say Remove one.

212
00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:54.820
On the Add button, we could say Add one.

213
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.305
And if internationalization
was the concern,

214
00:14:58.305 --> 00:15:02.234
you could customize how
these labels are generated.

215
00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:06.784
I guess that could be something from if
you're consuming assets from the backend,

216
00:15:06.784 --> 00:15:11.218
if there's other languages, or I guess,
depending on your strategy for that.

217
00:15:11.218 --> 00:15:16.057
But that is a whole other side of
things that we're not gonna get

218
00:15:16.057 --> 00:15:17.982
too deep into right now.

219
00:15:17.982 --> 00:15:23.697
So our input for
that quantity needed a label as well.

220
00:15:23.697 --> 00:15:26.466
So we've talked a lot
about the label element.

221
00:15:26.466 --> 00:15:31.786
The aria-label attribute can
work fine on form controls.

222
00:15:31.786 --> 00:15:37.340
I think sometimes there's a real
preference for text that's on screen.

223
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.668
If you can show text in a label,
do that first, but just know that for

224
00:15:42.668 --> 00:15:47.080
screen reader purposes,
we can use aria-label also.

225
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:51.810
So for this one, I guess Quantity,

226
00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:56.541
it's under a heading of Quantity,

227
00:15:56.541 --> 00:15:59.549
maybe Product count.

228
00:15:59.549 --> 00:16:00.782
That's the value.

229
00:16:00.782 --> 00:16:04.792
So kind of take some inspiration
from the variable name.

230
00:16:04.792 --> 00:16:07.405
So that will describe
what the field is for.

231
00:16:07.405 --> 00:16:13.410
And then the actual value like these aria
things will describe what's the number,

232
00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.488
how many items are in there.

233
00:16:15.488 --> 00:16:17.306
So that should work.

234
00:16:17.306 --> 00:16:22.054
I know we had some issues in our header,
so let's go up there.

235
00:16:22.054 --> 00:16:25.261
That's under ProductHeader.

236
00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:31.066
We had two banner, two headers, basically.

237
00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:33.356
So there's this header element.

238
00:16:33.356 --> 00:16:38.178
And then within Banner,
which I'm gonna scroll up to get to,

239
00:16:38.178 --> 00:16:40.791
this one also has role of banner.

240
00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:43.799
Okay, which one do we wanna keep?

241
00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:47.516
I think the one that wraps
everything that looks like a header.

242
00:16:47.516 --> 00:16:52.037
I think this one could
potentially go in that header.

243
00:16:52.037 --> 00:16:56.576
But if we really wanted to give it
a region or some sort of a sectioning

244
00:16:56.576 --> 00:17:01.289
element, we could say role= region,
and then we can give it a label.

245
00:17:01.289 --> 00:17:07.744
So this already had an aria-labelledby
pointing to this hidden paragraph.

246
00:17:07.744 --> 00:17:12.419
So kind of an interesting detail
about aria-labelledby is that it

247
00:17:12.419 --> 00:17:15.756
will still connect a label
on another element,

248
00:17:15.756 --> 00:17:19.271
even if that element is
hidden with display none.

249
00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:22.450
So we'll learn more about
ARIA a little bit later.

250
00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:28.458
Okay, so we fixed that, I know we've
got our Menu button had issues.

251
00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:32.780
Wait, we have a,
let's say, Previous slide.

252
00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.733
Maybe that one wasn't coming up,
but I know it's an issue.

253
00:17:35.733 --> 00:17:40.005
So Next Slide, that one had a label.

254
00:17:40.005 --> 00:17:44.754
Down in our header,
we had a Menu button missing a label.

255
00:17:44.754 --> 00:17:50.649
I think the shopping cart had this
text within the link, so it was fine.

256
00:17:50.649 --> 00:17:53.036
This empty aria-label,
we could just delete.
