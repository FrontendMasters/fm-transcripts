00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.444
One of our basic things, like I
mentioned in the beginning that a lot of

2
00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:09.172
the accessibility issues that are out
in the world are fortunately, they're

3
00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:14.340
really easy things to fix, I've kind
of an optimistic way of looking at it.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.390
Alternative text is one of the biggest.

5
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.726
So for any image or graphic on
the screen that has content that

6
00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:27.969
we want to describe,
coz not everything is worthy of that.

7
00:00:27.969 --> 00:00:32.823
We have to provide what's called
alternative text, or alt text.

8
00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:34.563
And let me stop you right there.

9
00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:36.243
It is not alt tags.

10
00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:43.256
Bit of a pet peeve of accessibility people
is that it is alt text, caught myself.

11
00:00:43.256 --> 00:00:44.426
It's not the tag.

12
00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:51.467
So the image tag becomes the image element
using those platform APIs we talked about.

13
00:00:51.467 --> 00:00:53.602
So it becomes an image object and

14
00:00:53.602 --> 00:00:59.056
the alt attribute is how we supply
alternative text for the most part.

15
00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:06.864
So there's an image on the screen of the
file name of the image is the bigone.jpg.

16
00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:11.664
If we didn't have the alt text and it just
said the big one, no one's gonna know what

17
00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:16.739
that means, coz that's what happens, is if
we don't include an alt attribute at all,

18
00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:21.054
it will try to read the file name,
which may or may not be informative.

19
00:01:21.054 --> 00:01:26.484
It could be, like cached, I mean,
it could just be gibberish.

20
00:01:26.484 --> 00:01:31.850
And I even have an example here of
a data URI data:image/jpg;base64,

21
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.544
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah,
no one's gonna read that.

22
00:01:36.544 --> 00:01:38.144
It'd be terrible.

23
00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:41.136
So the risk of not including
alt text is that it is just

24
00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:44.540
not anything that will
communicate what's on the screen.

25
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.484
So instead,

26
00:01:46.484 --> 00:01:50.810
this picture of a big pizza has the alt
attribute of a huge pepperoni pizza.

27
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.429
And I took this example because
it was from a quote from someone,

28
00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.271
a blind person that I'm
friends with on Facebook, and

29
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:06.058
they were really feeling left out that
people weren't describing their images.

30
00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:09.210
It was a pepperoni pizza was the example.

31
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.530
They were left out of the joke.

32
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.930
And so we wanna include that context and
describe what's in the image.

33
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.148
Note, I didn't use the word image of,
or photo of.

34
00:02:21.148 --> 00:02:22.818
I just said, what's in it?

35
00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:23.618
Describe it.

36
00:02:23.618 --> 00:02:24.948
Be brief.

37
00:02:24.948 --> 00:02:26.328
Be brief but descriptive.

38
00:02:26.328 --> 00:02:30.388
It can be kind of an art,
[LAUGH] creating alt text.

39
00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:35.092
I will say, I mean, since that person
wrote that, I think they work at Facebook,

40
00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:39.252
so it might have been part of an
announcement of their APIs for generating

41
00:02:39.252 --> 00:02:44.085
alt text automatically, which Facebook
does now, but they're not that great.

42
00:02:44.085 --> 00:02:49.874
I mean, it'll be like object may
contain round thing or pizza.

43
00:02:49.874 --> 00:02:55.500
It's not very artistic, or I mean,
I have a degree in photojournalism,

44
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.635
so captions are part of the content.

45
00:02:58.635 --> 00:03:05.076
So if we can supply alt text we should coz
we're gonna do a better job than AI will.

46
00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:09.967
So the risks are big especially when
it's like, that's just one image, but

47
00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:14.785
yeah, multiply that times how many times
this happens all over the Internet,

48
00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:19.106
and it is one of the top five
accessibility issues is lacking alt text.

49
00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:25.669
Also we should say though
that not every image is going

50
00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:33.639
to be descriptive enough to require alt
text like the actual alt text content.

51
00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.139
We can skip over it.

52
00:03:35.398 --> 00:03:38.641
So there is a thing
called decorative images,

53
00:03:38.641 --> 00:03:43.378
like if you have I don't know,
spacer gifts or images of decorative

54
00:03:43.378 --> 00:03:48.694
borders that you somehow couldn't
create with CSS for whatever reason.

55
00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:55.464
You're not gonna say all equals border,
probably.

56
00:03:55.464 --> 00:04:00.384
I mean, you have to make that judgment
call of, is this decorative or not?

57
00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:04.425
And if it is you can have the screen
reader not read out that file name by

58
00:04:04.425 --> 00:04:06.387
putting an empty alt attribute.

59
00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:12.586
And there are some times when maybe this
is what you wanna do because of what's

60
00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:16.090
wrapping the image,
like if it's in a button or in a link,

61
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.397
you might change how you
decide what to put in there.

62
00:04:19.397 --> 00:04:20.767
And for that use case or

63
00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:25.113
any of these contextual
decisions that you have to make.

64
00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:29.494
There is this awesome resource
called the Alt Decision Tree,

65
00:04:29.494 --> 00:04:33.603
that will walk you through
how to make these decisions.

66
00:04:33.603 --> 00:04:35.453
So, does it contain text?

67
00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:35.983
No.

68
00:04:35.983 --> 00:04:37.273
Okay, continue.

69
00:04:37.273 --> 00:04:40.566
Yes, and, and
then you can go through these scenarios.

70
00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:42.761
Or is it used in a link or a button?

71
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:48.897
And so this can be super helpful
coz there's so many different

72
00:04:48.897 --> 00:04:55.145
scenarios where you have to decide what
would make a good piece of alt text.

73
00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:56.741
So some great advice.

74
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.901
I have this one bookmarked also.

75
00:04:59.901 --> 00:05:01.953
So keep that on handy.

76
00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:10.090
And CSS background images are another
case where maybe you've got rather

77
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.753
than image tags, you have background
images generated for whatever reason.

78
00:05:15.753 --> 00:05:20.224
An example of how I came along this
technique was actually working for

79
00:05:20.224 --> 00:05:22.393
Target on their annual reports.

80
00:05:22.393 --> 00:05:26.247
We had a lot of data tables
that were super stylized, and

81
00:05:26.247 --> 00:05:31.833
this was before we could use CSS grid, and
a lot of the modern styling we have now.

82
00:05:33.063 --> 00:05:35.764
You can embed an infographic or
a table, and

83
00:05:35.764 --> 00:05:39.200
then basically mark up behind
it what is actually in it.

84
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.891
And so if you have a background image
laying over that, you could even toggle

85
00:05:43.891 --> 00:05:48.235
the image on and off, if you wanted
to let people choose which format.

86
00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:52.342
Do they want the stylized one or
the actual data table?

87
00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:53.992
You could let them choose.

88
00:05:53.992 --> 00:05:59.247
But if you wanted to sort of markup
the alt text behind the background image

89
00:05:59.247 --> 00:06:04.418
with way more content than you could
possibly fit into an alt attribute,

90
00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:08.353
coz there is a limit, I mean,
it's a string, right?

91
00:06:08.353 --> 00:06:11.073
You can't put markup in there.

92
00:06:11.073 --> 00:06:16.157
So if you needed to have
a more complex alternative

93
00:06:16.157 --> 00:06:20.402
bit of content you can do this technique.

94
00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:21.572
I have one here for

95
00:06:21.572 --> 00:06:26.254
the most popular licensed dog breeds
in town from a police department.

96
00:06:26.254 --> 00:06:30.683
And so you can mark the image,
get that to show up and

97
00:06:30.683 --> 00:06:33.878
make it responsive or whatever, and

98
00:06:33.878 --> 00:06:40.934
then you can put content inside of
that element and give it a CSS class.

99
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:42.844
Visually hidden is the one
that I have in here.

100
00:06:42.844 --> 00:06:47.376
It's also called SR only or
screen reader only sometimes, and

101
00:06:47.376 --> 00:06:50.369
this technique will clip that content and

102
00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:54.576
basically hide it visually,
but it still gets rendered.

103
00:06:54.576 --> 00:06:56.607
There's that word again.

104
00:06:56.607 --> 00:07:00.444
It still gets rendered, so
it will be part of the accessibility tree,

105
00:07:00.444 --> 00:07:01.687
we just won't see it.

106
00:07:01.687 --> 00:07:04.908
So there's our first mention
of the accessibility tree.

107
00:07:04.908 --> 00:07:09.437
It comes up right away [LAUGH] for
image alt text.

108
00:07:09.437 --> 00:07:14.286
So for this technique,
I used a role of image on the div that has

109
00:07:14.286 --> 00:07:18.778
a background image asset on it,
and I'm describing it.

110
00:07:18.778 --> 00:07:21.669
So giving it, it's got the image role,

111
00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.772
it also needs a little bit of extra
help to say what is the description for

112
00:07:26.772 --> 00:07:31.911
this image, and I pointed it to
the ID of the content behind it.

113
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:36.835
So dog background text, and it's got
an H2 in there, it's got a paragraph for

114
00:07:36.835 --> 00:07:41.481
this little subheader for the source
of the Hutchison Police Department.

115
00:07:42.525 --> 00:07:44.565
And then I described the graph.

116
00:07:44.565 --> 00:07:47.502
Graph with six bars showing
different dog breeds and

117
00:07:47.502 --> 00:07:49.645
all of their different rankings.

118
00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:55.763
And surprise, the Labrador retriever
is the most popular [LAUGH].

119
00:07:55.763 --> 00:07:59.836
So it's cute doggies, but
you could use this technique if you have

120
00:07:59.836 --> 00:08:02.686
background images that
you need to describe.

121
00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:07.520
And as I mentioned, having a toggle to
actually show the table like if it was

122
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.200
more tabular data than this, I described
what was in it in this case, but

123
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.545
sometimes you might really have
figures and tables and all that stuff.

124
00:08:17.545 --> 00:08:21.248
Hopefully you can style
things pretty well now.

125
00:08:21.248 --> 00:08:25.381
Just know that there's alternative
ways of presenting information.

126
00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:30.861
And then I mentioned the Facebook AI
alt text cuz that always comes up.

127
00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:32.586
People just want to not do it.

128
00:08:32.586 --> 00:08:35.991
[LAUGH] So
can we have a computer do it for us?

129
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:41.614
You could try, but as I mentioned,
alt text attribute of image may include

130
00:08:41.614 --> 00:08:47.384
adult female with child outdoor scene,
that's better than nothing.

131
00:08:47.384 --> 00:08:52.282
But if it said something like, a woman
carries her daughter on a colorful autumn

132
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:55.805
walking trail at Golden Hour,
which one sounds better?

133
00:08:55.805 --> 00:09:00.757
Personally, I think having more capturing
the essence of what is in a photo,

134
00:09:00.757 --> 00:09:03.805
you're thinking about
the person reading it,

135
00:09:03.805 --> 00:09:07.633
not just letting the computer
generate some random stuff.

136
00:09:08.733 --> 00:09:11.213
There are some APIs that
you could check out.

137
00:09:11.213 --> 00:09:17.756
There's one called alt-text.ai, and
another one called automated alt-text API.

138
00:09:17.756 --> 00:09:22.699
I think where those become more relevant
is if you did nothing it would literally

139
00:09:22.699 --> 00:09:27.511
be hundreds of images with nothing,
like CMSs, user-generated content.

140
00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:33.559
You kind of can't get around it sometimes
that something is better than nothing, and

141
00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:39.369
in that case, here are some APIs to maybe
go down that path and see if it's viable.

142
00:09:39.369 --> 00:09:41.971
Just know that it's gonna be the same, but

143
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:45.837
we can't have artisan handcrafted
alt text in every case.

144
00:09:45.837 --> 00:09:47.947
So those are some trade
offs that we have to make.

145
00:09:48.947 --> 00:09:53.176
&gt;&gt; I had one question, I guess,
about styling alt text, because I've had

146
00:09:53.176 --> 00:09:57.891
situations for the company I work at where
we've tried inserting alt text and for

147
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:00.683
whatever reason the image
just doesn't load.

148
00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:05.403
And then the alt text is right there and
visible, and it feels like we have people

149
00:10:05.403 --> 00:10:09.364
complaining about that,
more than the accessibility concerns.

150
00:10:09.364 --> 00:10:13.979
And I'm trying to figure out a good way
to marry both of them, just like make

151
00:10:13.979 --> 00:10:18.576
things pretty for the sighted users,
but also keep things accessible.

152
00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:20.016
Do you have any tips?

153
00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:22.632
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I've tried combining the visually

154
00:10:22.632 --> 00:10:26.533
hidden trick with like
the aria-labelled attribute, but

155
00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:29.195
I wasn't sure if there was a better way.

156
00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:30.816
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so great question.

157
00:10:30.816 --> 00:10:35.159
About fallback, so when an image
doesn't load it's great point,

158
00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:37.001
that the alt text will show.

159
00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:39.489
And I think you can marry techniques.

160
00:10:39.489 --> 00:10:43.216
That's a use case that, I mean,
it happens often enough,

161
00:10:43.216 --> 00:10:45.540
you're getting feedback about it.

162
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.789
So one technique I would recommend
is right here in this technique for

163
00:10:49.789 --> 00:10:53.746
the CSS background images,
how I'm using aria-labelledby,

164
00:10:53.746 --> 00:10:57.350
which we'll talk about a little
bit more in the workshop.

165
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:03.005
But that points to another
element to get the content.

166
00:11:03.005 --> 00:11:08.258
So you could do something where maybe
you have the alt text in an element

167
00:11:08.258 --> 00:11:12.725
that can be styled,
how to hide it when the image is loaded.

168
00:11:12.725 --> 00:11:16.531
That's kind of the thing I haven't
thought through fully, but

169
00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:19.525
you could label an image
with aria-labelledby.

170
00:11:19.525 --> 00:11:24.820
And when we get into debugging,
I'll give you some techniques on how

171
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:31.434
to inspect what actually is the label for
this image, or a name for this image.

172
00:11:31.434 --> 00:11:36.788
So there's other ways you could try it,
but yeah, it's kind of an experimental

173
00:11:36.788 --> 00:11:43.479
thought at this point, coz yeah, you can't
really style the fallback text, maybe.

174
00:11:43.479 --> 00:11:45.579
Have you played with the CSS of?

175
00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:50.422
&gt;&gt; I've done a little bit, so sort of
the approach that we have right now is

176
00:11:50.422 --> 00:11:55.025
that we've got the old attribute
itself set to an empty string, but

177
00:11:55.025 --> 00:11:58.449
then we have some other
visually hidden element.

178
00:11:59.599 --> 00:12:00.999
For context, this doesn't react.

179
00:12:00.999 --> 00:12:05.267
The elements are right next to each other,
and they're super co-located, but

180
00:12:05.267 --> 00:12:09.221
basically we've got this other element
that has the actual text in it, and

181
00:12:09.221 --> 00:12:10.931
it's visually hidden.

182
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:15.640
We're hoping they're sort of semantically
linked by some sort of ID value, but

183
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.488
it's just, to be honest, it's not
something we've tested super extensively,

184
00:12:20.488 --> 00:12:21.684
and we don't know.

185
00:12:21.684 --> 00:12:25.170
Okay, does one take more
precedence over the other?

186
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:29.239
&gt;&gt; I feel like that's perfect setup for
what we're gonna do in debugging,

187
00:12:29.239 --> 00:12:31.384
coz yeah, it's kind of hard to tell.

188
00:12:31.384 --> 00:12:33.828
You don't really know until you test it.
