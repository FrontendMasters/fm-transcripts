00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.815
We talked a little bit about the range
of experience that people have with

2
00:00:04.815 --> 00:00:07.460
disability, that it's so varied.

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.087
This really comes through in how
people interact with computers and

4
00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:13.540
mobile devices.

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.086
We can think about how some people
use the mouse, some people don't.

6
00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.066
Some people use things
called switch devices,

7
00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:26.171
which are small keyboard devices
that have a limited set of keys.

8
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:30.099
So if you have limited motion but
you can hit a couple of keys,

9
00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.887
you have an easier interface
to get through the computer.

10
00:00:33.887 --> 00:00:39.114
Some people use headwands,
if you're quadriplegic or paraplegic and

11
00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:44.963
you have limited use of your limbs, there
are other ways of navigating the web.

12
00:00:44.963 --> 00:00:47.884
And so if we really focused on the basics,

13
00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:53.310
amazingly we can sort of support some of
this technologies that people use and

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.083
so, even more of a reason to learn
the basics of web accessibility.

15
00:00:58.083 --> 00:01:01.946
So lets start busting some
myths about accessibility,

16
00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:06.637
some of the things that I've seen
crop up that are misconceptions.

17
00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:10.960
So first, screen readers use JavaScript.

18
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.937
Don't need to make a Node.js site for

19
00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:18.690
a screen reader to use it,
they look at the page as rendered.

20
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.030
And that as rendered is, that's gonna
come up a lot, I mentioned shadow DOM and

21
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.294
web components, that's kind of the term
I learned in how accessibility would

22
00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:34.264
apply to that, was that it's important
that it's how it gets rendered.

23
00:01:34.264 --> 00:01:37.094
It's like the whole thing and
the rendered source of the page.

24
00:01:37.094 --> 00:01:38.717
So screen readers rely on that.

25
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.278
That said, screen readers are not
the only aspect of accessibility.

26
00:01:45.278 --> 00:01:50.408
We'll dive into it quite a bit, but we're
gonna hopefully give you lots of tips and

27
00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:54.235
techniques for more than just
screen reader accessibility.

28
00:01:54.235 --> 00:01:56.513
People also navigate by voice.

29
00:01:56.513 --> 00:02:01.979
And this is one area that semantic HTML
in particular will really help out.

30
00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:09.266
One question that I've gotten is, can we
track screen readers to know kind of how

31
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:14.206
people are using our sites,
how many people are using screen readers?

32
00:02:14.206 --> 00:02:15.867
And the answer is no.

33
00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:20.909
And it's not for a technical reason,
it's actually for a privacy reason mostly.

34
00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.491
I have an article in
the slides from Marco Ziha,

35
00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:27.276
he worked at Mozilla for a long time.

36
00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:30.337
He's blind, and
he wrote very passionately about why

37
00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:34.538
we shouldn't track screen readers on
the web, and I'll read this quote.

38
00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:38.634
He said, letting a website know you're
using a screen reader means running

39
00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:42.986
around the web, waving a red flag that
shouts, here, I'm visually impaired or

40
00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:45.102
blind at anyone who is willing to look.

41
00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:50.975
And so we don't want to track people
who don't want to be tracked.

42
00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:55.188
He said that it was the one place
being the web that blind people

43
00:02:55.188 --> 00:02:59.730
could navigate around relatively
undetected without comments or

44
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.966
without needing help if something
was actually accessible.

45
00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:08.762
I thought that's really powerful to be
able to help people live more independent

46
00:03:08.762 --> 00:03:11.453
lives just by making
stuff more accessible.

47
00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:15.832
That's an impact that we don't
necessarily think about all the time.

48
00:03:18.128 --> 00:03:22.748
So yeah, lots of ways that people use
the web, and we just wanna build it

49
00:03:22.748 --> 00:03:27.293
accessibly and just let it be,
we're not gonna try and track people.

50
00:03:27.293 --> 00:03:30.821
There are some areas of analytics,
if you're really curious about that,

51
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:32.053
we can talk about it more.

52
00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:38.357
But for screen readers in particular,
we do not wanna track people.

53
00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:43.192
So, we have some overlapping
areas of accessibility that kind

54
00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:47.661
of feed into that persuasion area,
if you need to convince

55
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:52.219
people of how can we line this
up with our other objectives,

56
00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:58.175
there are some overlaps starting with
search-engine optimization, SEO.

57
00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:03.519
So accessibility doesn't
directly affect how websites

58
00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:09.202
are ranked in things like Google or
Bing, but headings are.

59
00:04:09.202 --> 00:04:13.526
There was a practice,
kind of an unfortunate practice in SEO of

60
00:04:13.526 --> 00:04:17.290
just jamming as many key words
as you could into a page.

61
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.731
And fortunately, that's not the way
people do things anymore but

62
00:04:21.731 --> 00:04:24.832
those heading tags
are still very important.

63
00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:30.641
They tell Googlebot or
blind people how a page is structured.

64
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:34.939
And so that semantic markup that
we put into our pages helps

65
00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:38.983
both accessibility and
search engine optimization.

66
00:04:38.983 --> 00:04:45.092
Also using links, like links in and out
of your site kind of create this network.

67
00:04:45.092 --> 00:04:50.185
Yeah, it just adds some legitimacy to
your site, links are good for navigating.

68
00:04:50.185 --> 00:04:54.158
They work great in screen readers and
with the keyboard.

69
00:04:54.158 --> 00:04:57.428
And so that's another overlap.

70
00:04:57.428 --> 00:05:01.802
Performance, which we will talk
about later in our design section.

71
00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:06.045
But if a site loads fast,
you can interact with it quicker.

72
00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:07.286
It's kind of good for everyone.

73
00:05:07.286 --> 00:05:12.011
It's like, yeah, accessibility
really is a benefit to everyone.

74
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:16.162
And there's a talk that I've linked
in these slides from Eric Bailey at

75
00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:17.967
the PerfMatters Conference.

76
00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:22.354
It was one of my favorite things
about accessibility and performance,

77
00:05:22.354 --> 00:05:25.937
like if you're a performance person or
interested in it,

78
00:05:25.937 --> 00:05:30.050
I would highly recommend checking
out that talk from Eric Bailey.

79
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.678
And again, we'll talk a lot
more about performance later.

80
00:05:33.678 --> 00:05:36.646
Security, I touched on this briefly, but

81
00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:42.342
if your user interface is inaccessible it
can become a privacy or security issue.

82
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:47.395
If you think of an ATM or
like a point of sale system or something,

83
00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:51.982
if a person can't interact
with it without getting help,

84
00:05:51.982 --> 00:05:54.713
they can't do it independently.

85
00:05:54.713 --> 00:05:59.824
So we want to try and make our interfaces,
either physical interfaces

86
00:05:59.824 --> 00:06:04.425
are kind of an analog to the digital
ones that we're creating.

87
00:06:04.425 --> 00:06:09.441
But we don't want to force someone to make
a choice between access and security.

88
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:15.723
Just really interesting to me, those
kind of overlaps are super fascinating.

89
00:06:15.723 --> 00:06:17.773
Customer and business growth.

90
00:06:17.773 --> 00:06:22.144
I mean, the more accessible your site is,
the more people can use it, or

91
00:06:22.144 --> 00:06:25.441
the flip side of it,
the less accessible your site is,

92
00:06:25.441 --> 00:06:29.398
the fewer people can use it,
the fewer customers you might have.

93
00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:34.708
For accessible platforms,
if they're accessible from the start,

94
00:06:34.708 --> 00:06:39.756
then you could have more early
adopters that have disabilities.

95
00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:44.255
It's unfortunately left out, accessibility
is left out often early in the process

96
00:06:44.255 --> 00:06:47.629
when that's precisely when we
need to think about it the most.

97
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:52.182
And so, I think it can help your
growth of your business to be

98
00:06:52.182 --> 00:06:56.021
considering accessibility
from the beginning.

99
00:06:56.021 --> 00:07:00.485
You also have the benefit of having
less debt, we talked about access debt,

100
00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:04.599
that accrues over time and it can be
really hard to root out when it's in

101
00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.619
the DNA of your business or
the DNA of your product.

102
00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:10.003
And so the earlier we tackle this,
the better.
