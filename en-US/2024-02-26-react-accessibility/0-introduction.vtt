1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.629
Welcome, today,
we're here to talk about accessibility.

2
00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.866
I'm Marcy Sutton Todd, and I am so

3
00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:09.380
excited to share what I know
about web accessibility with you.

4
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.654
I wanted to tell a quick story
about how I got into accessibility,

5
00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:17.631
because we're recording this
course here in Minneapolis.

6
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:21.883
You're probably watching it from
wherever you are in the world, but

7
00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:25.486
I got into accessibility kind
of because of Minneapolis.

8
00:00:25.486 --> 00:00:29.215
Target is here,
big retailer in the United States,

9
00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:32.959
and I worked at an agency
that had Target as a client.

10
00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:34.680
As a front-end developer,

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.275
I was assigned to work on that
client on all those projects.

12
00:00:38.275 --> 00:00:40.847
I didn't know anything
about accessibility.

13
00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:43.989
Nothing, I had made all of
the common faux pas, right?

14
00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.979
The code I wrote was a lot of
action script before that.

15
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.360
So I didn't know anything
about accessibility, but

16
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.848
I learned that I really cared about it.

17
00:00:52.848 --> 00:00:55.585
The more I learned about accessibility and

18
00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:59.310
how I could work it into my
front-end code and design, and

19
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.188
all the things we'll learn about today,
I really started to care about it.

20
00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:09.173
And once I met people with disabilities
who would benefit from the work that we

21
00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:13.401
could do together on web accessibility,
it just clicked for me.

22
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:18.107
It's something that I've never been able
to turn off in my mind, I'm always asking

23
00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:22.168
about it in people's code reviews and
design reviews, and all of that.

24
00:01:22.168 --> 00:01:25.406
And that's my hope for
you is that it will click.

25
00:01:25.406 --> 00:01:28.525
And be inviting,
cuz we don't know everything.

26
00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.567
I can't even possibly cover
everything today, but

27
00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:36.209
I can share with you a process of learning
and understanding of accessibility.

28
00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.654
Where to go to learn more and
some of the basic things that as

29
00:01:40.654 --> 00:01:46.027
professional front-end developers,
so that's my goal for today.

30
00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:47.985
So what is accessibility?

31
00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:52.807
It really is ensuring that people
can use the experiences that we

32
00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:57.645
build regardless of their
physical ability, mental ability.

33
00:01:57.645 --> 00:02:00.950
That they can interact
with these services and

34
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.178
products that we're
putting out on the web.

35
00:02:04.178 --> 00:02:07.058
It also means that people
can contribute to the web.

36
00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:11.568
So if we're making authoring tools or,
I mean, a lot of services

37
00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:16.242
that we're building these days
are things we use in the workplace,

38
00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:18.624
HR software, banking software.

39
00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:23.613
I mean, all of those things are really
important to be accessible, right?

40
00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:28.484
So this topic can apply to so
many different things.

41
00:02:28.484 --> 00:02:32.349
And I think sometimes
organizations get that.

42
00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.597
It starts to get real muddy when
it's less of a clear requirement.

43
00:02:36.597 --> 00:02:41.446
In agencies where you can kind of
ship stuff without anyone really

44
00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:46.043
holding you accountable,
I think we can do better, though.

45
00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:49.672
I work in an agency now, too,
again, and it's great, but

46
00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:53.087
the requirements
are a little bit more loose.

47
00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:58.973
And so sometimes we really have to be
the champions within our workplaces

48
00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:05.547
to get people to understand the cost of
what not doing accessibility would mean.

49
00:03:05.547 --> 00:03:10.016
So the cost, really, to kind of get into
that is that someone with a disability

50
00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:13.622
wouldn't be able to use your web
application or your website.

51
00:03:13.622 --> 00:03:19.358
They might not be able to independently
enter their bank details or something.

52
00:03:19.358 --> 00:03:23.156
Becomes a privacy issue or
a security issue, and so

53
00:03:23.156 --> 00:03:28.290
it sort of snowballs into being
a bigger cost for those individuals.

54
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.716
But those individuals
are often marginalized, so

55
00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:35.141
that's kinda the heart of
what we're getting at,

56
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:38.660
is not marginalizing people
who have a disability.

57
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.754
It's kind of a, I don't know, heavy
feeling when you really think about it.

58
00:03:44.754 --> 00:03:49.566
It's not just edge cases here, these
are real people that we're talking about.

59
00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:56.750
So it's foundational, and there is
a rich history of disability rights and

60
00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.478
activism to try and
make things more accessible.

61
00:04:01.478 --> 00:04:07.718
Here, I have a picture of the Capitol
Crawl from the 70s where people physically

62
00:04:07.718 --> 00:04:13.879
put their bodies on inaccessible stairways
to advocate for accessible spaces.

63
00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.536
Including the Americans with
Disabilities Act, which is a big piece of

64
00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:23.590
legislation in the United States that
codified a lot of these requirements.

65
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.533
And so people have been fighting for
access for decades.

66
00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:33.189
And it's really relevant to us now
in that we're still pushing for

67
00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.417
the web to be accessible.

68
00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:38.316
We have some benefits of being developers,
and

69
00:04:38.316 --> 00:04:42.741
that it's a lot easier to rebuild
a digital space than a physical space.

70
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.782
So we can incrementally improve things.

71
00:04:45.782 --> 00:04:47.700
We can totally tear it down and

72
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.780
start over without having to tear
it down a physical building.

73
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.483
We can make changes to things a little
bit easier in a lot of cases, not always.

74
00:04:58.483 --> 00:05:01.156
I work on a code base that
is not that easy to change.

75
00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:04.518
So it does take some effort and
some planning and

76
00:05:04.518 --> 00:05:07.976
lots of development cycles,
but it can be done.

77
00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:14.050
So really recognize that
history of activism.

78
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.980
That's kind of an important part of
it that we shouldn't really remember.

79
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.677
And there are so
many different types of people

80
00:05:22.677 --> 00:05:25.789
in the world that when
disability as a topic comes up,

81
00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.439
we wanna consider all of the different
ways that people move through the world.

82
00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.852
What are people's bodies?

83
00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:34.625
How does that impact how they
interact with a computer?

84
00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:39.844
If someone has a vision disability, that's
kind of the area we hear about the most,

85
00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:42.134
with people who use screen readers.

86
00:05:42.134 --> 00:05:46.794
So we'll dive way into screen
readers in the next section.

87
00:05:46.794 --> 00:05:49.453
But vision is one aspect of disability.

88
00:05:49.453 --> 00:05:54.636
Someone could have limited movement if
they can't use a mouse, a pointing device.

89
00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:59.431
Cognitive disabilities for thinking,
remembering, learning, communicating.

90
00:05:59.431 --> 00:06:03.769
Hearing, that's a big one for
accessibility that's often forgotten, so

91
00:06:03.769 --> 00:06:06.494
things like transcripts and
closed captions.

92
00:06:06.494 --> 00:06:11.819
This workshop will need to be
captioned for people to follow along.

93
00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.922
And people can have more
than one disability.

94
00:06:15.922 --> 00:06:18.679
People don't fit neatly into little boxes.

95
00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:23.915
And so we wanna consider the broad kind
of spectrum of the human experience

96
00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:28.652
when it comes to disability,
cuz it can affect anyone at any time.

97
00:06:28.652 --> 00:06:31.553
So it really affects all of us
when you think of it that way,

98
00:06:31.553 --> 00:06:34.053
it's not the other person,
it's someone else.

99
00:06:34.053 --> 00:06:36.995
It's not my customer, it's not my problem.

100
00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:39.565
Well, if you've look a little closer,
it probably is.

101
00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:43.643
Your co-worker or
your customer might have color blindness.

102
00:06:43.643 --> 00:06:47.970
They might have diabetes and
they're at risk of losing their eyesight.

103
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.173
I hear these stories all the time when
you ask people and they go, wait,

104
00:06:52.173 --> 00:06:53.892
I do have a connection to this.

105
00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:55.496
And so, yeah.

106
00:06:55.496 --> 00:07:00.281
&gt;&gt; I got my eyes dilated yesterday,
and as I was sitting there waiting,

107
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:04.915
I was looking at my phone,
everything got blurrier and blurrier.

108
00:07:04.915 --> 00:07:07.412
And then I left and
then I had to do something on my phone and

109
00:07:07.412 --> 00:07:08.982
I couldn't read my phone anymore.

110
00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:13.748
So I had to pull out the accessibility
zoomer [LAUGH] on my phone.

111
00:07:13.748 --> 00:07:19.196
So that type of stuff affected
me directly yesterday.

112
00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:22.635
&gt;&gt; Wow, yeah, and
your phone has great tools for that.

113
00:07:22.635 --> 00:07:23.481
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

114
00:07:23.481 --> 00:07:28.074
&gt;&gt; My parents have their phones
zoomed way in, you look over and

115
00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:29.973
their font size is huge.

116
00:07:29.973 --> 00:07:36.133
Technology is adaptive, and it's so
cool, I mean, bicycles are adaptive.

117
00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:41.015
There's all kinds of things in
the world now that we can adapt to make

118
00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:43.768
them suit our lived experience more.

119
00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:49.085
And the web has so many different
things that we can make better.

120
00:07:49.085 --> 00:07:53.305
And they're not even that hard, it's
just it's stuff that gets marginalized.

121
00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:57.294
So I'm here, I'm here to hold your hand.

122
00:07:57.294 --> 00:08:01.532
[LAUGH] And we're gonna do it
cuz there's so many easy wins.

123
00:08:01.532 --> 00:08:05.986
The most accessibility issues that
we see out there in the world

124
00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:08.181
are really easy things to fix.

125
00:08:08.181 --> 00:08:11.974
So we can be glass half full thinkers,
and just go, all right,

126
00:08:11.974 --> 00:08:15.212
we've got lots of stuff we can fix,
so let's fix it.

127
00:08:15.212 --> 00:08:20.455
Let's build it right from the first
time because it's is really adaptive and

128
00:08:20.455 --> 00:08:21.837
we can make it work.

129
00:08:21.837 --> 00:08:23.608
And I'm pretty optimistic about it.

130
00:08:26.221 --> 00:08:31.406
So it's really easy to find
accessibility failures out there.

131
00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:35.538
And accessibility folks, I love them.

132
00:08:35.538 --> 00:08:40.047
I think it's part of the coping mechanism
[LAUGH] of dealing with the fact that

133
00:08:40.047 --> 00:08:44.414
the web isn't very accessible is to
point out the failures and as a group,

134
00:08:44.414 --> 00:08:46.617
be like [SOUND] isn't this terrible?

135
00:08:46.617 --> 00:08:48.782
But we need more wins, too.

136
00:08:48.782 --> 00:08:53.229
It's like we don't wanna be drowning in
misery, we want to highlight our wins.

137
00:08:53.229 --> 00:08:57.410
So I encourage you, when you get
something that's an improvement

138
00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:00.781
even if it's a work-in-progress,
celebrate it.

139
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.384
Give kudos to your teammates,
share things with your teams,

140
00:09:04.384 --> 00:09:09.424
share what you've learned if you've got
the capacity [LAUGH] to write it down.

141
00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.842
Some of the blog posts
that I wrote in the past,

142
00:09:11.842 --> 00:09:16.514
I'm really glad I wrote them because I
captured what I learned at the time.

143
00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:19.322
And I just wanna encourage
everyone to celebrate your wins.

144
00:09:20.563 --> 00:09:24.955
I created a blog a while back called
Accessibility Wins that was aimed at

145
00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:25.767
doing this.

146
00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:30.492
It got a little hard to maintain because
I've always was striving for perfection,

147
00:09:30.492 --> 00:09:32.392
and that's just not realistic.

148
00:09:32.392 --> 00:09:34.342
We don't need to be perfect,

149
00:09:34.342 --> 00:09:38.564
we just need to keep putting in
the effort to make things better.

150
00:09:38.564 --> 00:09:40.869
And if it takes a number of cycles or

151
00:09:40.869 --> 00:09:45.970
iterations on something to get it
better and better, I think that's okay.

152
00:09:48.409 --> 00:09:53.181
But we've got some really important
reasons to overcome what I'm calling

153
00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:54.097
access debt.

154
00:09:54.097 --> 00:09:58.745
So we have design debt, we have
technical debt, we have access debt.

155
00:09:58.745 --> 00:09:59.677
Stuff in our code base.

156
00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:05.333
I mean, the design and development are so
overlapping in what create these problems,

157
00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:09.608
that we've got a unique type of
debt that is accessibility debt.

158
00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:14.435
And the reasons that we need to
overcome it, the most basic reason,

159
00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:19.010
thinking back to the Capitol Crawl and
the disability rights and

160
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:22.414
activism, it's a civil
right to have access.

161
00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:26.075
And that should be enough,
that really should be enough of a reason.

162
00:10:26.075 --> 00:10:30.887
It's something we've been fighting for for
decades, and we really should honor that,

163
00:10:30.887 --> 00:10:32.436
it's the right thing to do.

164
00:10:32.436 --> 00:10:35.898
Sometimes that is just lost
in translation, and so

165
00:10:35.898 --> 00:10:39.030
depending on who you need to convince.

166
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.759
Maybe you have some other stakeholders or
co-workers or

167
00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:46.028
people who just don't care for
whatever reason.

168
00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:49.323
There's other reasons that we
can kinda pull out as a carrot.

169
00:10:49.323 --> 00:10:50.645
We have the carrot and

170
00:10:50.645 --> 00:10:54.772
the stick way of communicating our
reasons why this is important.

171
00:10:54.772 --> 00:10:58.735
The legal issues are a big stick to use.

172
00:10:58.735 --> 00:11:02.021
People, depending on
what country you're in,

173
00:11:02.021 --> 00:11:06.441
you have different laws that make
accessibility a requirement.

174
00:11:06.441 --> 00:11:08.800
Especially in certain sectors,

175
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.106
anything procured by the federal
government, education.

176
00:11:13.106 --> 00:11:16.916
There's lots of different areas
where the legal side applies.

177
00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:21.129
It's not my favorite aspect of it but
it is part of it.

178
00:11:21.129 --> 00:11:25.694
Sometimes pride in your craft is
the way to get through to people,

179
00:11:25.694 --> 00:11:29.517
like being pragmatic about
quality in your software.

180
00:11:29.517 --> 00:11:34.230
And sometimes that can be the angle
to get someone sort of selfishly to

181
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.737
care about it is that you
can make it easier to test.

182
00:11:37.737 --> 00:11:40.091
You could make it more robust.

183
00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:45.031
Being able to make your application
respond to different user inputs that you

184
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:47.011
haven't even thought of yet.

185
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:49.618
It's just more robust software, and

186
00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:54.919
the web is mostly accessible by default,
we just have to try not to mess it up.

187
00:11:56.399 --> 00:11:57.835
And then there's business cases.

188
00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:01.721
If you have to convince
the business stakeholders,

189
00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:05.962
maybe there's a way to persuade
these folks about having

190
00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:10.393
a larger customer reach,
a risk of losing out on business.

191
00:12:10.393 --> 00:12:15.301
And so, yeah, there's all of these
different levers that we can kind of

192
00:12:15.301 --> 00:12:20.137
pull to make the case for accessibility,
which I do have to say though.

193
00:12:20.137 --> 00:12:24.250
As a single interactive developer,
UI developer, full stack,

194
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.836
wherever your role is,
this is a little bit much to try and

195
00:12:27.836 --> 00:12:31.347
carry this weight on your back
all the time, to be like,

196
00:12:31.347 --> 00:12:35.883
I'm doing this work and trying to
convince everyone around me to do it.

197
00:12:35.883 --> 00:12:39.893
So I want you to give yourself some grace.

198
00:12:39.893 --> 00:12:43.472
That's why accessibility can
be sort of draining, but

199
00:12:43.472 --> 00:12:47.659
I want to invigorate you to find
the things that you can control and

200
00:12:47.659 --> 00:12:50.965
that you can change, and
we wanna make progress.

201
00:12:50.965 --> 00:12:54.346
That's why celebrating
those wins is important.

202
00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:58.280
We wanna balance all this
with getting our job done and

203
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.713
upholding quality among all the other
things that we have to think about.

204
00:13:03.713 --> 00:13:07.316
I have some links here if you want
to learn more about the legal side.

205
00:13:07.316 --> 00:13:12.856
There is a link in here about Target's
legal case, sort of relevant.

206
00:13:12.856 --> 00:13:16.409
It's how I got into accessibility
was because of that legal case,

207
00:13:16.409 --> 00:13:18.131
so if you wanna read about that.
