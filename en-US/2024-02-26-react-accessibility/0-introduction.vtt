1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.943
Welcome, today we're here to
talk about accessibility.

2
00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:05.308
I'm Marcy Sutton Todd, and I am so

3
00:00:05.308 --> 00:00:09.643
excited to share what I know
about web accessibility with you.

4
00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:12.914
We have a GitHub, I shared it in the chat,

5
00:00:12.914 --> 00:00:16.372
it is on Marcy Sutton as
my GitHub account and

6
00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:21.713
the frontend-masters-web-accessibility-v3
repository.

7
00:00:21.713 --> 00:00:26.332
This course is going to be
a little bit technical.

8
00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:27.993
As a front-end developer,

9
00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:32.084
you sort of can't get away from
the technical side of accessibility.

10
00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:37.257
But feel free to stop me at any time or
ask questions, so that we

11
00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:43.540
can unpack things that maybe you're
needing a little bit of extra help on.

12
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.215
So our repo and
our project is built with Next.js, so

13
00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:50.724
we're going to look at react
quite a bit today, but

14
00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:56.048
anything that we do with react will
apply to web-accessibility in general.

15
00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:57.471
What we wanna focus on,

16
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:00.902
at the end of everything is
what is rendered in a browser.

17
00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:03.074
What is a user going to experience?

18
00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:08.066
So keep that in mind, kinda regardless
of the framework, the technology,

19
00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:11.500
we're really focused on
that end user experience.

20
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.596
Okay, so a quick spin through our GitHub.

21
00:01:14.596 --> 00:01:15.786
You can clone this,

22
00:01:15.786 --> 00:01:19.990
you can also just follow along if you
want to observe what we're doing.

23
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.683
I'll explain everything,
we'll go through all the examples but

24
00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.959
you can clone this repository.

25
00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:31.917
And then there are some set instructions
in here on how to get this running on

26
00:01:31.917 --> 00:01:32.949
your machine.

27
00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:36.638
There's also a link over here on the side.

28
00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:40.039
You can open up the fully
built version of this,

29
00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.961
including the examples in
their more working states.

30
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:46.662
I wouldn't say they're perfectly final,

31
00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:49.953
because accessibility is
always a work in progress.

32
00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:54.742
But there are more complete examples
that I'll show you in a minute.

33
00:01:54.742 --> 00:01:57.570
So I've got this already pulled down.

34
00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.635
I used VS Code as my text editor.

35
00:02:00.635 --> 00:02:04.733
So let's take a little bit of
a tour through here to get started.

36
00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:09.902
I've got the README open right now,
but over here in my file explorer,

37
00:02:09.902 --> 00:02:14.826
we've got pages, which is how
the course materials are broken up.

38
00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:19.486
A lot of our attention will be
spent in the components directory.

39
00:02:19.486 --> 00:02:25.510
So this has a series of UI components that
have accessibility issues built into them.

40
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.573
And as we go through the topics,
we will work on those.

41
00:02:29.573 --> 00:02:34.910
And the more finished versions are in
the completed components directory.

42
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.129
So you can always look ahead,
you can compare,

43
00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.923
do a diff between what we had and
what we're working on.

44
00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:46.716
And so that's kind of the structure
of how our exercises are split up.

45
00:02:46.716 --> 00:02:51.560
I wanted to tell a quick story about
how I got into accessibility because

46
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.125
we're recording this course
here in Minneapolis.

47
00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:59.421
You're probably watching it from
wherever you are in the world, but

48
00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:03.059
I got into accessibility kind
of because of Minneapolis.

49
00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:07.011
Target is here,
big retailer in the United States, and

50
00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:10.468
I worked at an agency that
had target as a client.

51
00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:14.332
As a front-end developer,
I was assigned to work on that client,

52
00:03:14.332 --> 00:03:15.715
on all those projects.

53
00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:18.747
I didn't know anything about
accessibility, nothing.

54
00:03:18.747 --> 00:03:22.616
I had made all of the common faux pas,
the code I wrote was a lot of

55
00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:27.451
action script before that, so I didn't
know anything about accessibility.

56
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:30.123
But I learned that I
really cared about it.

57
00:03:30.123 --> 00:03:33.301
Like, the more I learned
about accessibility and

58
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:36.857
how I could work it into my
front-end code and design and

59
00:03:36.857 --> 00:03:41.715
all the things we'll learn about today,
I really started to care about it.

60
00:03:41.715 --> 00:03:46.687
And once I met people with disabilities
who would benefit from the work that we

61
00:03:46.687 --> 00:03:49.375
could do together on Web Accessibility.

62
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:50.640
It just clicked for

63
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.920
me as something that I've never
been able to turn off in my mind.

64
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.960
I'm always asking about it in people's
code reviews and design reviews and

65
00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.663
all of that.

66
00:03:59.663 --> 00:04:03.695
And that's my hope for you,
is that it will click and be inviting,

67
00:04:03.695 --> 00:04:05.933
because we don't know everything.

68
00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.619
I can't even possibly
cover everything today.

69
00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.515
But I can share with you
a process of learning and

70
00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:15.295
understanding of accessibility,
where to go to learn more.

71
00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:19.809
And some of the basic things that we
really should know as professional

72
00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:23.415
front-end developers, so
that's my goal for today,

73
00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:25.037
&gt;&gt; Someone was saying,

74
00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:30.088
I'm a UI developer where accessibility
plays an important role,

75
00:04:30.088 --> 00:04:34.877
but I'm learning things like 3D web and
data visualization.

76
00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:40.398
I'm wondering how accessibility will
look like in those type of areas.

77
00:04:40.398 --> 00:04:41.577
&gt;&gt; Great question.

78
00:04:41.577 --> 00:04:45.237
So depending on what you're creating,
you may or

79
00:04:45.237 --> 00:04:48.906
may not be able to build
in a lot of accessibility.

80
00:04:48.906 --> 00:04:52.353
If you're doing a lot of
3D rendering with Webgl or

81
00:04:52.353 --> 00:04:57.561
something, Motion sensitivity
might be a factor and

82
00:04:57.561 --> 00:05:02.803
that's a topic that we'll cover later on
in our nmvisual consideration section.

83
00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:06.806
I'm gonna go to our overview page, we
are gonna get into some of those things.

84
00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:11.006
But in terms of user
interface accessibility,

85
00:05:11.006 --> 00:05:15.941
there has to be something on
the end user experience that

86
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:20.981
has that requirement of if
a mouse user can do something.

87
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.874
A keyboard user has to be
able to do the same thing.

88
00:05:23.874 --> 00:05:26.323
And if you're doing a data visualisation,

89
00:05:26.323 --> 00:05:29.112
there are unique accessibility
aspects to that.

90
00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:33.439
So I think depending on kind
of what you're building,

91
00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.081
where it falls in the tech stack.

92
00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:40.259
If a user is experiencing this thing,
if they could see it,

93
00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.954
if they're aside a person,
there's likely to be some concerns.

94
00:05:44.954 --> 00:05:48.277
It's such a broad question, though,
that it's kind of hard to cover it all.

95
00:05:48.277 --> 00:05:54.629
[LAUGH] But hopefully that leads you
down a path of just being curious.

96
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:57.092
That's my goal for
you is just to be curious about it.

97
00:05:57.092 --> 00:05:59.227
How would it apply here?

98
00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:03.664
And some of my earliest research into
accessibility was in web components and

99
00:06:03.664 --> 00:06:05.858
Shadowdom when those first came out.

100
00:06:05.858 --> 00:06:09.745
And my biggest question was,
what do I need to think about for

101
00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:11.508
accessibility with this?

102
00:06:11.508 --> 00:06:16.973
And that took me down a path of
research and experimentation.

103
00:06:16.973 --> 00:06:19.546
I ended up doing some conference
talks at the end of that.

104
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:23.164
Don't necessarily [LAUGH]
recommend that part.

105
00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:27.703
But the research part and
the investigation, the testing,

106
00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:30.288
what does it do in a screen reader?

107
00:06:30.288 --> 00:06:31.571
Fire it up and find out.

108
00:06:31.571 --> 00:06:32.844
Make some improvements.

109
00:06:32.844 --> 00:06:39.639
And we'll cover the tips and techniques
that you'll need to get into that today.

110
00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.159
All right, so we've got a lot
to cover today as I mentioned,

111
00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:45.933
there's no way we could
possibly cover it all.

112
00:06:45.933 --> 00:06:51.819
I'm one person, so this is what I thought
should be included in this course.

113
00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:56.511
We'll cover some of the foundational
information that you should know

114
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.075
about accessibility so

115
00:06:58.075 --> 00:07:02.935
that we set the scene about what's
really the most important thing here.

116
00:07:02.935 --> 00:07:06.247
We'll talk about some standards and
some definitions,

117
00:07:06.247 --> 00:07:08.180
I get questions about that a lot.

118
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.646
My own coworkers,
when I presented on accessibility to them,

119
00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:14.679
they are very smart people.

120
00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:18.933
And they had questions immediately about
which standards do we need to adhere to.

121
00:07:18.933 --> 00:07:20.390
What are the guidelines?

122
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.788
So we'll cover some of that.

123
00:07:22.788 --> 00:07:25.294
But we wanna go beyond standards and
guidelines.

124
00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:30.570
Really, we want this to be
an experience that's enjoyable.

125
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.548
We're designing with delight,
but we don't want to harm people.

126
00:07:34.548 --> 00:07:39.261
So we'll go into areas of accessibility,
including screen readers.

127
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:43.738
We're gonna dive right into that,
so that'll be fun.

128
00:07:43.738 --> 00:07:48.883
We'll have some accessibility
debugging that I would say is probably

129
00:07:48.883 --> 00:07:54.472
the most common set of processes that I
use when I look at any user interface.

130
00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:59.667
We'll look at accessible HTML,
which is really the foundation of a lot

131
00:07:59.667 --> 00:08:04.873
of accessibility, kind of regardless
of framework library tooling.

132
00:08:04.873 --> 00:08:09.110
That's what will get rendered
in a web experience.

133
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:10.536
We'll look at ARIA,

134
00:08:10.536 --> 00:08:15.784
kind of demystify what is this ARIA thing
that you may have heard about or seen.

135
00:08:15.784 --> 00:08:18.318
We'll look at keyboard focus management,

136
00:08:18.318 --> 00:08:21.403
which is some of my favorite
parts of accessibility.

137
00:08:21.403 --> 00:08:24.363
I will be honest with you,
I love that stuff, so

138
00:08:24.363 --> 00:08:27.030
we're gonna geek out pretty hard on that.

139
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.486
And then we'll wrap up the day
with some visual considerations,

140
00:08:31.486 --> 00:08:36.752
because there are aspects of design
that come through in Web Accessibility,

141
00:08:36.752 --> 00:08:39.849
like motion, that we talked about briefly.

142
00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:44.673
And then I'll have some resources for
you at the end, where to learn more.

143
00:08:44.673 --> 00:08:47.590
Hopefully I get you fired up to
want to learn more after this.

144
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:53.147
Cuz it's really a passion of mine that
has, I've carried through my whole career.

145
00:08:53.147 --> 00:08:55.951
So if I could even have
an inkling of that feeling for

146
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.309
you, that would be a major success today.
