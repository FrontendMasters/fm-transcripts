1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.632
I just wanted to throw out a couple more
things here of places where I think you

2
00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:04.438
can go from here.

3
00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:08.299
I think I've already probably
mentioned almost all of these.

4
00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:13.149
So first one, round out yourself by going
to the Frontend Masters Learning Path.

5
00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:14.885
They keep these up to date.

6
00:00:14.885 --> 00:00:16.972
Pick the one that applies to you.

7
00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:20.579
If you're taking this course,
you probably wanna take the beginner one.

8
00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:22.461
You got more CSS coming.

9
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:23.911
You got more JavaScript coming.

10
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:27.399
Bianca's a great teacher,
talks about fundamentals.

11
00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.934
And then Jon down here will talk
to you about accessibility.

12
00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:32.108
And then there's more stuff
to go on from here, right?

13
00:00:34.562 --> 00:00:40.516
From there, you can go into things like
deep React, more CSS, the React stuff.

14
00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:42.911
That's kind of all the various
different places for you to go.

15
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:46.525
Frontend Masters does a really good job of
guiding you where you're supposed to go.

16
00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:50.540
Just some personal
favorite courses of mine.

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.716
If that commandline stuff
felt uncomfortable,

18
00:00:53.716 --> 00:00:55.500
I have a whole course on it.

19
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.196
I quite like it.

20
00:00:57.196 --> 00:00:59.328
[LAUGH] I wrote it.

21
00:00:59.328 --> 00:01:01.880
Git, you should learn Nina's stuff.

22
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.825
Jem will teach you deploying your code.

23
00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:10.471
Scott's Moss's course on Node.js is
really good if you wanna go backend.

24
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:13.624
If you wanna try a framework,
React is really good.

25
00:01:13.624 --> 00:01:14.828
I also teach that course.

26
00:01:14.828 --> 00:01:17.558
But the Vue, Svelte, and
Angular ones are really good too.

27
00:01:17.558 --> 00:01:20.921
And then if you wanna get
more into computer science,

28
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:26.017
I also have a course on that where we use
JavaScript to do computer science stuff.

29
00:01:26.017 --> 00:01:29.163
I'd probably do a bit more
JavaScript stuff before hopping into

30
00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:30.160
computer science.

31
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.606
But that's really useful, particularly for
people that wanna interview for

32
00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:36.165
Frontend developer jobs.

33
00:01:36.165 --> 00:01:39.148
So please tweet at me, I'm always
happy to hear what people think.

34
00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:44.726
Unless you didn't like it, and
in which case, tweet that at Jem Young.

35
00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:46.587
He needs to probably hear that.

36
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.550
Best of luck on your
continued coding path.

37
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.150
At this point, I think we can take any
sort of question you wanna ask me.

38
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.010
I know some people had some career
questions that they wanna ask me.

39
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.809
So any sort of career advice, or

40
00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:06.043
dating advice, I can also do that.

41
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:13.869
Dog care, very passionate about
those sorts of things, Normal stuff.

42
00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.220
Anyway, what kind of
questions do people have?

43
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.800
What are my thoughts on working at
a big company versus a startup?

44
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.230
I've done both, obviously.

45
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.920
I worked at a really small series
a startup in Utah, once upon a time.

46
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.989
The biggest company by
far would be Microsoft.

47
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.882
I was really early at Reddit.

48
00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:41.388
I was employee 29 at Reddit,
so very early there.

49
00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:42.323
Obviously, Reddit's huge now.

50
00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:43.982
I think they have over
a thousand employees.

51
00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:51.736
And then I've worked at Stripe,
which is medium to large sized startup.

52
00:02:51.736 --> 00:02:57.310
When I worked at Netflix, it was
about the same size of Stripe as now.

53
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.115
I've enjoyed both.

54
00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:02.339
And I will say that different people
are very much drawn to different things.

55
00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:06.261
I worked with a lot of people that were
just stoked to work at Microsoft, and

56
00:03:06.261 --> 00:03:08.575
they've been at Microsoft for 25 years.

57
00:03:08.575 --> 00:03:12.002
And that's been their dream, they have no
other dream, and I think that's great.

58
00:03:12.002 --> 00:03:14.060
Microsoft is a absolutely
wonderful place to work.

59
00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.272
I really enjoyed my time there.

60
00:03:16.272 --> 00:03:20.252
And I've also worked with people that just
hop from small startup to small startup,

61
00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:22.886
and are like,
I can't deal with bureaucracy, which,

62
00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:24.643
big companies is just bureaucracy.

63
00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:27.987
That's kinda how it works.

64
00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:31.102
So what's my advice there?

65
00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:35.486
The time when I learned the most in my
career was when I worked at Reddit by far,

66
00:03:35.486 --> 00:03:37.583
because it was such a small company.

67
00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:40.554
I had to learn everything
by trial by fire,

68
00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:44.442
because either I fixed something,
or we had downtime.

69
00:03:44.442 --> 00:03:46.546
And so I had to fix everything.

70
00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:49.483
I had to fix the things that
I was not comfortable fixing.

71
00:03:49.483 --> 00:03:53.618
I had to learn a bunch of stuff just
because it was necessary, right?

72
00:03:53.618 --> 00:03:59.494
Very stressful [LAUGH], and
it's hard to recommend people to do that,

73
00:03:59.494 --> 00:04:05.681
because not everyone's in a position
that that's acceptable, right?

74
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:09.273
I could not do that now because
I have a young child, and

75
00:04:09.273 --> 00:04:11.783
I could not abandon my wife like that.

76
00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:15.689
And not to imply that other people
won't do it, I couldn't today do that,

77
00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:16.810
what I did back then.

78
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.532
But back then, my wife was working a lot.

79
00:04:19.532 --> 00:04:21.920
I was working a lot, and
that was totally okay.

80
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.377
And while I burned out because I
worked too much, at the same time,

81
00:04:26.377 --> 00:04:31.090
I'm where I am in my career today
because I worked as hard as I did then.

82
00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.890
So I have a super healthy
respect to people.

83
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.020
So draw your boundaries, only work your
40 hours a week and stick to that.

84
00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.090
That's where I am today.

85
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.530
I really try not to work
more than 40 hours a week.

86
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.592
But Brian eight years ago just
worked all the time and loved it.

87
00:04:48.592 --> 00:04:53.997
I actually really enjoyed it,
but that's not for everybody.

88
00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:58.907
So I'm kind of trying to delineate for
this person that asked,

89
00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:07.823
Startups versus, At big companies.

90
00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:12.543
When I was at Microsoft, and I had to take
a week off, either because I was burned

91
00:05:12.543 --> 00:05:15.939
out, or because Reed was having
a bad week or something.

92
00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:18.231
Reed's my son.

93
00:05:18.231 --> 00:05:18.860
Pretty easy to do, right?

94
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.960
There was enough people.

95
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.871
There was enough redundancy
of responsibilities

96
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.650
that could mostly be
papered over fairly well.

97
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.247
If I did that at Reddit,
we were gonna have downtime,

98
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:35.671
because I was essential to
everything going on there, right?

99
00:05:35.671 --> 00:05:38.040
So you need to figure out where
you fit in that picture, right?

100
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.505
There's a total acceptable thing that
where you could go work at your local.

101
00:05:42.505 --> 00:05:44.830
I worked for a TV station.

102
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.860
That was my first development job.

103
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.167
You can work there for 30 years.

104
00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:50.724
You can make decent money and
you can be really happy, and

105
00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:52.864
I have no judgment for
anyone in that position.

106
00:05:52.864 --> 00:05:57.008
You could jump from startup to startup and
just work your tail off for years and

107
00:05:57.008 --> 00:05:59.506
years and years and
have the best time as well.

108
00:05:59.506 --> 00:06:03.570
And you just need to ask yourself,
where am I going, and what do I want?

109
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.639
So I really enjoyed both my experiences,
I wouldn't trade it.

110
00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:10.920
I think I'm kind of anxious to get into
something smaller again, eventually.

111
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.532
I'm very happy at Stripe at the moment.

112
00:06:15.073 --> 00:06:17.622
Cuz I enjoy wearing all of the hats,
right?

113
00:06:17.622 --> 00:06:22.182
I enjoy having to do frontend and backend
and ops, and sales and marketing, and

114
00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:24.782
product management, and all those things.

115
00:06:24.782 --> 00:06:27.351
When you're at a big company,
you typically have very narrow focus.

116
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:31.122
I work just on the TV app,
which is what I did at Netflix, right?

117
00:06:31.122 --> 00:06:34.730
That's all I did, so I just worked
on the TV app for a long time.

118
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.378
So it's kind of a meandering
line of thought,

119
00:06:38.378 --> 00:06:42.220
but yeah,
I think I feel pretty good about that.

120
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.248
&gt;&gt; Just interesting,
there was a debate by Jem Young.

121
00:06:48.248 --> 00:06:53.688
Or he kinda kicked it off around
trying to go from a junior developer

122
00:06:53.688 --> 00:06:58.932
all the way to a senior, and
how he thinks it's pretty difficult

123
00:06:58.932 --> 00:07:05.170
to essentially working outside of your
job, working nights and weekends.

124
00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.131
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; To kind of amplify, try new things,

125
00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:09.990
learn.

126
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:15.301
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so
the question that was asked was how

127
00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:20.993
does one get from a junior to a mid or
senior developer?

128
00:07:20.993 --> 00:07:23.691
And people have varying opinions on this.

129
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.990
And this is kind of
related to my last answer.

130
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.211
Way earlier in my career, I would go
home at night after coding all day, and

131
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:35.300
I'd be still be stoked about coding,
and I would code at night, right?

132
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.541
I would try new frameworks.

133
00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:39.728
I'd try new techniques,
I'd read books, I'd watch videos,

134
00:07:39.728 --> 00:07:41.860
I'd watch things like Frontend Masters.

135
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.860
I did all those things because
I was excited about it, right?

136
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.614
I genuinely found it refreshing to
code outside of my day-to-day work,

137
00:07:48.614 --> 00:07:52.364
cuz I found out when you're at work,
you have to use their framework, and

138
00:07:52.364 --> 00:07:54.200
you're dealing with legacy code.

139
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.940
And you don't really get to work on
new creative expressions of coding.

140
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.537
When I would go home and code at night,
I'd get to work on what I wanted to work

141
00:08:02.537 --> 00:08:06.497
on, and I could throw things away, and
I wouldn't have to work on legacy, right?

142
00:08:06.497 --> 00:08:09.400
So that made me really excited.

143
00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:14.514
And that was incredibly fruitful for
my early career.

144
00:08:14.514 --> 00:08:19.067
So a good example of that
was when I was at Reddit,

145
00:08:19.067 --> 00:08:23.510
I had been working in Angular,
old Angular, or

146
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:27.528
Angular 0.8, or something like that.

147
00:08:27.528 --> 00:08:30.058
And I had a friend at work introduce
me to it, was this like, hey,

148
00:08:30.058 --> 00:08:32.643
there's this new thing from Facebook
that came out called React.

149
00:08:32.643 --> 00:08:34.831
You should give it a shot, right?

150
00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:38.546
And so I went home and I just had a code
bender on it, wrote a bunch of code in it.

151
00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:43.888
I got so excited about it that actually,
at night outside of my day job, rewrote

152
00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:49.900
our entire checkout process in React,
which, again, this was 2014 or something.

153
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.462
I think it was 2014, which at that
time was incredibly early for

154
00:08:55.462 --> 00:08:57.811
React, abnormally early.

155
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:02.893
Reddit was one of the first companies
outside of Facebook to run React,

156
00:09:02.893 --> 00:09:05.614
thanks to me working on this so early.

157
00:09:05.614 --> 00:09:09.322
And that got me to be a React
expert really early in my career,

158
00:09:09.322 --> 00:09:14.007
which then ended up being really fruitful
for me that got me a job at Netflix.

159
00:09:14.007 --> 00:09:16.060
And then that got me a job at LinkedIn,
and

160
00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.357
all these kind of
different places like that.

161
00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:23.267
This would've never happened if I
didn't have that kind of lock myself in

162
00:09:23.267 --> 00:09:25.570
a room and code kind of mentality.

163
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.486
Another really good example of
that is when in my very first job,

164
00:09:29.486 --> 00:09:33.412
I would teach myself Node at night,
cuz I was doing PHP at my job.

165
00:09:33.412 --> 00:09:38.212
And when I was interviewing for my first
startup job, the guy just asked me,

166
00:09:38.212 --> 00:09:39.868
was like, what do you do?

167
00:09:39.868 --> 00:09:40.970
Tell me about stuff that
you've done recently.

168
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:42.437
And I told him, I was like, hey,

169
00:09:42.437 --> 00:09:44.808
check out all this Node stuff
I just did this weekend.

170
00:09:44.808 --> 00:09:49.475
And that really impressed the CTO of
this company who then ended up hiring me

171
00:09:49.475 --> 00:09:52.527
largely based on this
conversation that we had.

172
00:09:52.527 --> 00:09:58.703
So I wanna kind of just delineate
I did it cuz I wanted to, right?

173
00:09:58.703 --> 00:09:59.996
No one told me that I had to do it.

174
00:09:59.996 --> 00:10:03.832
I wasn't doing it because I felt I
had to do it to advance my career.

175
00:10:03.832 --> 00:10:06.508
Also, undeniably, it advanced my career.

176
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:13.486
So I encourage you, when you have moments
where you feel like doing things,

177
00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:17.807
when you feel like doing codes like that,
chase that dragon, right?

178
00:10:17.807 --> 00:10:22.940
Have a good time and enjoy yourself, and
express things, and make stupid apps.

179
00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.821
It's one of my favorite things that
I see people doing on Twitter,

180
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:31.341
is they make the most inane dumb things,
just cuz it brings them joy, right?

181
00:10:31.341 --> 00:10:34.555
Or they'll make really fun CSS drawings.

182
00:10:34.555 --> 00:10:38.363
And if that brings you joy, then just
lean into it and have a great time.

183
00:10:38.363 --> 00:10:42.621
But if you're just like, I have to learn
Python today because I need Python on my

184
00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:45.877
resume, it's gonna be a drag,
and you're gonna burn out.

185
00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:48.240
I think that's a big part of this,
is I really didn't burn out.

186
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.531
This actually was fun.

187
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:54.009
Instead of playing video games or watching
Netflix, I was out there writing code, and

188
00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:55.736
I was having the same sort of fun.

189
00:10:55.736 --> 00:10:56.765
It was relaxing.

190
00:10:59.192 --> 00:11:02.224
I don't know, I'm really hesitant about
the advice that I give out there because I

191
00:11:02.224 --> 00:11:03.275
don't want you to burn out.

192
00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:05.172
I want you to continue enjoying this.

193
00:11:05.172 --> 00:11:10.046
I'm hoping that to this point, you've
enjoyed what we've shared together, right?

194
00:11:10.046 --> 00:11:13.623
And if you just come out with I hate this,
and I never wanna do it,

195
00:11:13.623 --> 00:11:16.421
then I think I've done you a disservice,
right?

196
00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:20.749
So you gotta find your balance, and
it's gonna be very personal too.

197
00:11:20.749 --> 00:11:23.880
What someone else tells you is
gonna work may not work for you.

198
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.431
But I guess that's what I'm saying,
is go seek your balance.

199
00:11:28.847 --> 00:11:32.842
Anyway, that's how I became a senior
engineer really quickly in my career,

200
00:11:32.842 --> 00:11:34.261
is a lot of coding at night.

201
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:41.229
Cool, that is the end of
the complete intro to Web Dev V3.

202
00:11:41.229 --> 00:11:42.890
So yeah, thanks [LAUGH].

203
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:49.836
