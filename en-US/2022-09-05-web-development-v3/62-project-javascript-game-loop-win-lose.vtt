00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:05.159
Now, let's go ahead and
do the win and lose condition.

2
00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:13.325
When does someone win,
If they get everything right, right?

3
00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:16.820
A couple ways you could do this,
really easy way, I guess.

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.513
I hadn't really thought about this,
might even be easier.

5
00:00:19.513 --> 00:00:22.673
In fact, you might even just
do this at the beginning,

6
00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:26.325
I don't know why you wouldn't
do it just really immediately.

7
00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:31.710
You could just say if currentGuess

8
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.470
=== word, right, then you win.

9
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.416
And you return, and you're done.

10
00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:45.809
That's actually not how I did it in this.

11
00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.899
Let's try that,
I think it works, alert(you win)

12
00:00:56.937 --> 00:01:00.612
So if I say ivory, you win.

13
00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:09.593
Or if I say pools here, yeah,
so it doesn't say that.

14
00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:11.633
Actually probably would do it this way,

15
00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:15.060
this is better than what I have in
my code, so do it that way, right?

16
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.080
Because if the current guess is
the correct word, you wouldn't have to

17
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.844
validate the word, because obviously it's
a word because it's the correct word.

18
00:01:26.943 --> 00:01:30.215
All right, I'm good with that,
so that's the winning condition.

19
00:01:33.982 --> 00:01:38.223
We also have to have some idea of being
done, right, because if you're done,

20
00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:41.073
you can't keep typing,
you can't keep guessing.

21
00:01:41.073 --> 00:01:43.997
So let's keep track of some
variable up here just called done.

22
00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:49.141
const done, at the beginning, you were
not done, so you're false up here.

23
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.997
And when you win,
done is assigned to true, right?

24
00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:57.231
I think that makes some sense.

25
00:01:57.231 --> 00:02:00.861
&gt;&gt; You have to make that a let.

26
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:06.689
&gt;&gt; Yes, thank you, habit, let done = true.

27
00:02:08.074 --> 00:02:10.663
And then here, we'll set done to true.

28
00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:14.931
We'll go use that in a second,
we just have to say down here in our

29
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:19.536
event listener, if we're done,
just ignore everything, right?

30
00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:22.625
Because once you're done,
once you've won or lost,

31
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.986
all your key presses become irrelevant.

32
00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:29.767
Okay, so there's that.

33
00:02:29.767 --> 00:02:30.970
When did they lose?

34
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.692
Well, at the end of a guess, and

35
00:02:40.692 --> 00:02:45.926
it's been six rounds,
then they're done, right?

36
00:02:50.018 --> 00:02:54.240
So if currentRow, which is the same
thing as what round we're on, right,

37
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.014
this is the first round, second round,
third round, fourth round, fifth round.

38
00:02:59.014 --> 00:03:04.179
So if the currentRow is the same of
how many rounds you're going for, so

39
00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:09.345
I'm just gonna put rounds here, and
then we'll define rounds later,

40
00:03:09.345 --> 00:03:12.722
then they're done, right, they've lost.

41
00:03:12.722 --> 00:03:17.664
So you can say alert,
you lose, the word was, and

42
00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:21.916
you can tell them what the word was, okay?

43
00:03:21.916 --> 00:03:26.853
Done is also assigned true,

44
00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:30.352
and you are finished

45
00:03:32.795 --> 00:03:40.389
I guess we probably won't
put this above here

46
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.591
Okay,, and so how many rounds are there?

47
00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:51.703
There are six So

48
00:03:51.703 --> 00:03:54.660
let me explain my decision there,
we do start on 0, right?

49
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.370
The current guess does start on 0.

50
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.063
And we are checking here
to see if it's six, right?

51
00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:06.357
By doing the current row increment here,
we can just make it line

52
00:04:06.357 --> 00:04:11.370
up nicely that when it hits six,
then you're done, right?

53
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.955
Otherwise I would have to check
if it was rounds minus 1, or

54
00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:16.297
I would have to set rounds to 5,
and make it 0 based.

55
00:04:16.297 --> 00:04:17.931
This just made everything
look really nice.

56
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:23.140
And let's just check if that works.

57
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.515
So if I say, Rounds is not defined.

58
00:04:30.852 --> 00:04:33.971
Rounds, thank you.

59
00:04:38.212 --> 00:04:43.810
And then here, I expect that if I hit
Enter, it should say you lose, right?

60
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.222
You do, the word was ivory.

61
00:04:48.238 --> 00:04:52.938
Cool, So
now we have our win in these conditions.

62
00:04:52.938 --> 00:04:55.347
We still have a problem that
now it's gonna be upset,

63
00:04:55.347 --> 00:04:57.756
because it's still listening
to my key presses, and

64
00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:00.983
it's trying to go to the seventh round,
and there is no seventh round.

65
00:05:00.983 --> 00:05:03.644
So it's being like,
I don't know what you're trying to do,

66
00:05:03.644 --> 00:05:05.909
because you're still
listening to my key presses.

67
00:05:08.643 --> 00:05:11.825
So let's go down and
put that in our event listener down here,

68
00:05:18.547 --> 00:05:20.725
Okay, let's do two things here.

69
00:05:20.725 --> 00:05:24.181
The other thing that we should
be aware of is, if it's loading,

70
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:26.494
we also shouldn't listen to key presses.

71
00:05:26.494 --> 00:05:28.519
So let's do that at the same time.

72
00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:32.669
So if they are done,
which is either gonna be true or false,

73
00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.576
if it's true, then don't do anything.

74
00:05:35.576 --> 00:05:39.218
Or if it's loading, and
I'll show you how to do or as well.

75
00:05:39.218 --> 00:05:42.177
I showed you and, right, which is &amp;&amp;.

76
00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:44.335
Or is | |, like that.

77
00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:50.717
So if it's done, or it's loading,
so if either one of these is true,

78
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:58.989
then do nothing, And return.

79
00:06:03.484 --> 00:06:08.593
So just to demonstrate a little
bit more the conditionals,

80
00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:15.251
if you say true and true, both of these
have to be true for this to return true.

81
00:06:15.251 --> 00:06:20.773
If either one of these is false,
then the whole thing is false, right?

82
00:06:25.715 --> 00:06:31.533
If you have true or true,
as long as one of them is true, it's fine.

83
00:06:31.533 --> 00:06:35.285
It's just when both of them
are false that it's false.

84
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:46.456
Just logic, right, logic operators So
that's what we're doing here.

85
00:06:49.528 --> 00:06:52.258
Here, One of them,

86
00:06:55.753 --> 00:07:00.361
This one, this &amp;&amp; was saying,
as long as this is true and this is true,

87
00:07:00.361 --> 00:07:04.381
then do this, right,
cuz both of those things have to be true.

88
00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:09.098
Same thing with here,
if you're done, right, or

89
00:07:09.098 --> 00:07:14.155
loading, don't do anything
when people press keys.

90
00:07:14.155 --> 00:07:18.115
So just to demonstrate that here,
if I say ivory, And

91
00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:23.186
we don't have an is loading somewhere,
we have to define that, right?

92
00:07:23.186 --> 00:07:28.576
So let's go ahead and
do that, let isLoading,

93
00:07:31.479 --> 00:07:35.893
Well, we'll set that up here cuz
it'll start in a loading position.

94
00:07:35.893 --> 00:07:40.681
And then down here,
once we set loading to false,

95
00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:45.249
then we can say isLoading
is assigned to false.

96
00:07:45.249 --> 00:07:48.187
So now, someone immediately comes in,
guns blazing, and

97
00:07:48.187 --> 00:07:52.387
just starts trying to type things, we're
gonna ignore them until we have the word.

98
00:07:52.387 --> 00:07:55.749
But let's put in here ivory, and
we'll get the win condition.

99
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:57.373
And then now, I can't type in it.

100
00:08:03.964 --> 00:08:06.038
The one thing why this
should go at the end,

101
00:08:06.038 --> 00:08:08.002
we wanna mark them all as green, right?

102
00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:11.972
We wanna give them the satisfaction
of seeing everything lit up in green.

103
00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:14.029
So I actually wanna move this to the end.

104
00:08:14.029 --> 00:08:18.022
Let's do that.

105
00:08:18.022 --> 00:08:21.926
So I'm gonna put down here if, and
I'll just make this an else-if

106
00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:28.122
This is sad, right?

107
00:08:28.122 --> 00:08:29.607
It looks incomplete.

108
00:08:29.607 --> 00:08:34.310
Whereas if I do ivory here,
now they get this nice green.

109
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:42.473
Now, I broke something.

110
00:08:42.473 --> 00:08:43.832
What did I break?

111
00:08:43.832 --> 00:08:45.367
Why did we not win?

112
00:08:51.744 --> 00:08:57.418
Cuz I messed with currentGuess,
I have to move this down all the way here.

113
00:08:57.418 --> 00:09:01.092
Right, because I set
currentGuess to be empty string,

114
00:09:01.092 --> 00:09:03.996
which is not gonna be
the same thing as word.

115
00:09:06.973 --> 00:09:11.358
Now, if I say ivory, I should get win,
it leaves everything in green, and

116
00:09:11.358 --> 00:09:12.553
now I can't type I.

117
00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:19.280
Guess and check, a lot of coding
again is just guess and check
