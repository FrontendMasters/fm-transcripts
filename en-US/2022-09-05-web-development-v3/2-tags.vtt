1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.010
Let's get into some HTML.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.545
We are going to build our
very first website and

3
00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:09.095
it's not gonna be a particularly exciting
website, but it's gonna be a website,

4
00:00:09.095 --> 00:00:10.600
it'll be a valid website.

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.633
It's gonna be a little ugly.

6
00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:15.784
It would be like building a house and

7
00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:19.956
then not putting any wallpaper or
siding on it or anything like that.

8
00:00:19.956 --> 00:00:24.270
Technically a valid house, maybe not
the best house, but we're gonna start with

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.286
technically valid house because I think
that's a good place to start with.

10
00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:32.894
So HTML, Hypertext Markup Language,

11
00:00:32.894 --> 00:00:37.946
technically not a programming language
because it doesn't actually do anything.

12
00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:40.170
You can think of it kind of like English,
right?

13
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.840
You can't run English, when you just
say English it has meaning, right?

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.162
But it's the same thing with HTML.

15
00:00:48.162 --> 00:00:51.436
It has meaning but it actually doesn't
run, it doesn't do anything by itself,

16
00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:53.906
you'll need the JavaScript to
actually do something to it.

17
00:00:56.582 --> 00:01:01.499
So the base building block in
HTML is something called a tag.

18
00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.522
And here on this line right here,

19
00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:06.640
we have the most basic HTML
that you could think of.

20
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.934
So I have my text here.

21
00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.665
This is a title to my document.

22
00:01:11.665 --> 00:01:15.969
And then it's surrounded by these two,
what we call tags,

23
00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.735
a beginning tag and an end tag, okay?

24
00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:21.996
By the way, these are totally interactive
so you can just start editing and

25
00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:25.121
you'll see what that looks like down
here in this little result thing.

26
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:29.799
We'll be doing that a lot today, okay?

27
00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.853
So I have this h1 tag
which is a heading tag and

28
00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:40.577
every tag in HTML has a beginning tag and
an end tag.

29
00:01:40.577 --> 00:01:44.031
Some of them are self closing, we'll
talk about that here in just a second.

30
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:49.700
But for now, think about the opening tag
which doesn't have the slash here, right?

31
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.747
So you have this little slash thing here.

32
00:01:52.747 --> 00:01:58.088
A beginning tag doesn't have the slash and
then the end tag always has the slash.

33
00:01:58.088 --> 00:02:00.690
So that's kind of how
you can think about it.

34
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.840
There's an opening tag, everything
between it and then a closing tag.

35
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.546
So everything inside of this h1.

36
00:02:06.546 --> 00:02:10.553
So this is the title to my document,

37
00:02:10.553 --> 00:02:15.640
is inside of that opening or
this header tag.

38
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.017
The tag declares what you are looking at,
right?

39
00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:20.964
So this particular one is a header.

40
00:02:20.964 --> 00:02:23.958
So for
example this complete intro to WEB DEV V3,

41
00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:27.463
that is the heading of my
website that I've created here.

42
00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:31.536
So that would be in an h1 tag.

43
00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:35.056
There's some 300 different types of tags,

44
00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:40.430
I think we're gonna go over some of them,
the most useful of them today.

45
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.730
We're then going to take these tags and
we're gonna start building larger and

46
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.589
larger documents.

47
00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:47.676
So we're gonna have
hundreds of tags on a page,

48
00:02:47.676 --> 00:02:52.007
there's probably websites that
have thousands of tags on a page.

49
00:02:52.007 --> 00:02:56.003
I'm sure this site probably has at least a
hundred on it, cuz we'll start using them

50
00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:59.568
and we'll start nesting them and
I'll show you that here in just a second.

51
00:03:02.064 --> 00:03:05.004
So something that's important is
obviously by putting this in an h1,

52
00:03:05.004 --> 00:03:06.229
I've made this big, right?

53
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.099
And I can put in a different kinda tag,
like, if I made this a p tag,

54
00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.990
instead of an h1 tag,
notice that it is much smaller now, right?

55
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.678
Because a paragraph of text,
which is what p stands for,

56
00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:19.150
it's gonna be much smaller than a heading,
right?

57
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.839
I think if you're
creating a Word document,

58
00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.190
you have some sort of heading, right?

59
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.061
And then I'll have all
the little text underneath it.

60
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:27.140
That's kind of the same concept here.

61
00:03:29.065 --> 00:03:32.476
But just know that later,
I can actually go and use CSS,

62
00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:37.569
the styling component here, to make things
bigger or smaller or things like that.

63
00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.567
So what I'm actually more communicating
here by what kind of tag I'm choosing

64
00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:47.118
is what the semantic meaning of this
particular bit of text is, right?

65
00:03:47.118 --> 00:03:50.931
I wouldn't wanna put a paragraph of
text here like this paragraph here,

66
00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:55.450
I wouldn't wanna make that an h1 because
it's not a heading in my document, right?

67
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.855
Whereas something like this,
this tags portion right here,

68
00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:00.871
this is obviously heading, I would wanna
use some sort of heading tag for it.

69
00:04:00.871 --> 00:04:05.780
That's kind of the idea here of
how we choose which tag to use.

70
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.969
You'll have a ton of practice by the end
of this course so if it's not sticking

71
00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:12.840
quite yet, just know that you're
gonna get a lot of repetition on it.

72
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.162
Hopefully one of these
explanations of it will stick.

73
00:04:16.162 --> 00:04:19.460
Practice, practice, practice, basically.

74
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.474
So h1's, that belies the fact
that there's probably an h2.

75
00:04:24.474 --> 00:04:27.556
You're right, there's actually
h1 all the way down to h6 and

76
00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:29.953
that's cuz you have headings and
sub headings and

77
00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:32.713
sub headings on your sub
headings all the way down to h6.

78
00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:35.117
I don't think I ever use h6's
to be honest with you but

79
00:04:35.117 --> 00:04:37.476
they're available there if
you ever need it though.

80
00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:45.453
Okay, know that if it's ever angled
bracket which is what these are called and

81
00:04:45.453 --> 00:04:49.852
then slash it's always a heading or
a closing tag, right?

82
00:04:49.852 --> 00:04:57.081
So, this slash belies the fact that it's
always going to be a closing tag, okay?

83
00:04:57.081 --> 00:04:59.941
We'll talk about self closing
tags here in a little bit or

84
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:04.680
sometimes called void tags, though I don't
hear that definition very much anymore.

85
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.530
But that'll look like this, where you
have a slash there at the end and

86
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.349
that's a tag that opens itself and
closes itself.

87
00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.317
Though technically you can actually
leave it off, it's optional.

88
00:05:14.317 --> 00:05:17.938
Sometimes you will see opening tags
that don't close because they're

89
00:05:17.938 --> 00:05:19.091
self-closing tags.

90
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:21.910
Again we'll talk about it, okay?

91
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.852
So you can nest tags as well, right?

92
00:05:26.852 --> 00:05:31.606
So I have a div tag, which stands for
a division, as you're basically

93
00:05:31.606 --> 00:05:36.743
saying here is a,
Something that's self contained and

94
00:05:36.743 --> 00:05:40.562
let me rephrase that
here in just a second.

95
00:05:40.562 --> 00:05:42.118
But I have an h1 tag here, right?

96
00:05:42.118 --> 00:05:48.630
My Hi tag here, or I can put something
else, the title of my website, right?

97
00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:54.852
But notice I have a div tag
that contains an h1 tag and

98
00:05:54.852 --> 00:05:58.134
then it closes the div down here, right?

99
00:05:58.134 --> 00:06:01.281
So that's kind of my point here is
you can have nesting of tags, right?

100
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:05.591
And I could actually put
another div in here.

101
00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:13.386
And another h tag here,

102
00:06:13.386 --> 00:06:18.786
the subtitle of my website, right?

103
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.611
And so I have an h1 here and
then I have another div here and

104
00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:25.255
then I have an h2 here, right?

105
00:06:25.255 --> 00:06:27.310
So you can see that showing up here.

106
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.851
So the question you might ask me is,
how much can I nest this?

107
00:06:32.851 --> 00:06:34.969
And the answer is infinitely, all right?

108
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:38.706
Some of these,
if you looked them into my source code,

109
00:06:38.706 --> 00:06:44.477
are nested probably 15 to 20 layers deep,
probably even more nested than that,

110
00:06:44.477 --> 00:06:48.461
so there's no limit to how
much you can nest these.

111
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:51.761
But something I want
you to notice here is,

112
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:55.977
notice that I have div and
then if I open an h1 tag here,

113
00:06:55.977 --> 00:07:00.857
then the next thing that I have
to close is this h1 tag, right?

114
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.476
So notice I opened the h1 tag,
I could not close the div here,

115
00:07:06.476 --> 00:07:09.847
I have to close the h1 first
before I can close the div.

116
00:07:09.847 --> 00:07:13.197
So let me show you an incorrect example
because I think that might demonstrate

117
00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:14.090
it better.

118
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.570
I have the div tag here,
then I have the h1 tag.

119
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.990
Notice that this closes the div tag here.

120
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:21.130
This is incorrect.

121
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:24.650
I have to close the h1
before I can close the div.

122
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:29.582
So another way of verbalizing that
is that the most recently opened tag

123
00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:32.160
must be the first one closed.

124
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:37.136
So this h1 here is the most recently
opened one or let's look at this h2.

125
00:07:37.136 --> 00:07:41.729
This h2 is the most recently opened tag
therefore I have to close it before I can

126
00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:42.640
close the div.

127
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.838
I think it's intuitive once
you start working with it but

128
00:07:46.838 --> 00:07:49.150
it's kind of hard to verbalize, right?

129
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.308
But it just makes it so
everything neatly nests together,

130
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.790
think of those Russian nesting dolls,
right?

131
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.470
I have to close the inner one before
I can close the outer one, right?

132
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:05.765
You have to have pieces that fit together
and things that fit inside of each other,

133
00:08:05.765 --> 00:08:07.440
it's kind of the same idea here.

134
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.880
That's kind of the basic
premise of what tags are.

135
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.914
We're basically just making content and

136
00:08:12.914 --> 00:08:16.756
then we're putting them inside of tags
that describe what's inside of them.

137
00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:21.172
So again think of it like writing a Word
doc but instead of going highlighting

138
00:08:21.172 --> 00:08:26.209
something and saying, make this italics,
we're gonna put a tag around it that says,

139
00:08:26.209 --> 00:08:30.362
this is emphasized text that then
describes what is inside of the text.

140
00:08:30.362 --> 00:08:34.247
It's actually a relatively similar
process to writing a Word document.

141
00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:38.425
Cool.

142
00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:43.893
We'll talk about what divs are and
literally here in the next chapter,

143
00:08:43.893 --> 00:08:46.194
so if you have a question
like what is a div?

144
00:08:46.194 --> 00:08:47.706
I'm literally about to show you.

145
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.785
Right?

146
00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:55.567
Let's get into types of tags.

147
00:08:57.382 --> 00:09:01.376
So I've shown you an h1, I've shown you,
alluded to what a div tag is.

148
00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:04.660
I'm just gonna go through it now and show
you a bunch of different kinds of tags.

149
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:13.160
So first one here,
we have the heading tag or the h1 tag.

150
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.311
But I wanted to show you that there's
actually all the way down to h6.

151
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.931
Now you might ask, Brian why does this
h2 have an underline underneath it?

152
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:23.730
It's actually using the CSS
directly from my website.

153
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.383
So every time you see one of these
with a underline underneath it,

154
00:09:28.383 --> 00:09:30.253
it's my h2 tag, right?

155
00:09:30.253 --> 00:09:32.970
So I have the h1 up here,
complete intro to web dev.

156
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.870
It's the name of my entire course, it's
the name of my entire document, right?

157
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:40.945
Some people will say that you can
only have one h1 tag on the page.

158
00:09:40.945 --> 00:09:44.478
I'm not so
draconian that I think that's the case.

159
00:09:47.459 --> 00:09:52.600
But some people will say that but
a good kind of information taxonomy

160
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:58.021
to think of is that you'll have an h1,
which is a title of a whole page.

161
00:09:58.021 --> 00:09:59.174
And then you'll have sub headings, right?

162
00:09:59.174 --> 00:10:02.415
So I have types of tags,
other things like that and

163
00:10:02.415 --> 00:10:06.430
we'll have subheadings
throughout the entire page.

164
00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:09.610
And then if my types of tags had
a subheading underneath that,

165
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.494
I would use an h3, so on and
so forth, it's with this.

166
00:10:12.494 --> 00:10:16.835
So that you can have various
types of nesting of headings.

167
00:10:16.835 --> 00:10:21.737
I've probably gone down to an h4 before,
I don't think I've ever used an h5 or

168
00:10:21.737 --> 00:10:22.542
h6 before.

169
00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:26.264
Because I don't think I've ever had
such nested information before but

170
00:10:26.264 --> 00:10:28.900
you could and
it exists precisely for that reason.

171
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:33.521
But notice there's kind of this
implied information hierarchy by

172
00:10:33.521 --> 00:10:36.414
making the heading smaller and smaller.

173
00:10:38.559 --> 00:10:39.925
And again just to remind you,

174
00:10:39.925 --> 00:10:42.448
these are editable if you
wanna mess around with them.

175
00:10:42.448 --> 00:10:47.037
That's kind of the point here of me
making these little editable tags here so

176
00:10:47.037 --> 00:10:51.067
that you can try them and see and
mess around with them and have fun.

177
00:10:52.862 --> 00:10:56.000
There's a lot of learning to be
done in play I think, personally.

178
00:10:58.372 --> 00:11:03.340
Okay, so I have a paragraph tag here and I
showed you that maybe a little bit earlier

179
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:07.809
but it's basically I have a paragraph
of text, literally this, right?

180
00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:11.886
This would be a paragraph of text.

181
00:11:11.886 --> 00:11:14.246
So a really good analogy for
paragraph text,

182
00:11:14.246 --> 00:11:16.864
imagine you're reading a chapter book,
right?

183
00:11:16.864 --> 00:11:19.910
And there's various different
paragraphs on the chapter book.

184
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:24.284
You can use a p tag to surround every
single chapter in the chapter book.

185
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:27.362
In a good place of when you
would use a paragraph, right?

186
00:11:27.362 --> 00:11:32.226
Notice when you would end a block of text,
you would have some sort of hard return,

187
00:11:32.226 --> 00:11:33.790
an indentation, right?

188
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.494
And you would continue on the text,

189
00:11:36.494 --> 00:11:40.923
that grouping of text is when
you would use a p tag, right?

190
00:11:40.923 --> 00:11:44.090
So here I have two different
paragraphs of text,

191
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.659
notice that it's nonsensical text,
it's called lorem ipsum text.

192
00:11:48.659 --> 00:11:52.701
It's meant to just look like real text but
don't actually say anything,

193
00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:54.729
it's a design thing that people do.

194
00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:57.489
Yeah, I have two different
blocks of texts,

195
00:11:57.489 --> 00:12:00.696
I would use two different
paragraph tags to do that.
