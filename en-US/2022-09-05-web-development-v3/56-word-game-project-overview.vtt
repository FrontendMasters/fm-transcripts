00:00:00.142 --> 00:00:03.634
This is your project,
this is the final project,

2
00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:07.469
we'll have a couple little
more sections after this.

3
00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:09.770
This time we're actually
gonna go through and

4
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.076
we're gonna code it side
by side afterwards.

5
00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:16.732
So, if you have trouble,
we'll do it together.

6
00:00:16.732 --> 00:00:22.187
You're gonna have to do all the HTML,
CSS and JavaScript yourself.

7
00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:27.151
There are infinite correct ways to do this
again, you don't have to do it my way,

8
00:00:27.151 --> 00:00:29.050
my way is just a way of doing it.

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.005
This took me about 125 lines of
JavaScript, about 50 lines of HTML and

10
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:35.667
about 75 lines of CSS.

11
00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:43.161
Again, I'm just kind of trying to help you
gauge if you're writing way too much code.

12
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.316
If you write 1,000 lines of code for this,
you can probably do a little bit less.

13
00:00:46.316 --> 00:00:49.881
And for the record, this actually
probably took me a couple hours, right?

14
00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:53.374
This took me more than an hour to do,
personally.

15
00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.215
This is definitely the hardest
one that we've done yet,

16
00:01:01.215 --> 00:01:04.180
I think this is harder than calculator.

17
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.020
Maybe as hard.

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.958
Adding the AJAX into it,
makes it a little bit more difficult.

19
00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:12.994
So I did give you some
Getting Started steps, like,

20
00:01:12.994 --> 00:01:17.287
I'm going to ask you to try and start
this yourself and see if you can do it.

21
00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:22.803
But if you need some steps of how I
started writing it, I wrote down here.

22
00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:25.521
Basically, step by step of,

23
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:31.300
I did this then I did this then I
did this then I did this, right?

24
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.115
And then down here,
I gave you all of my answers.

25
00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:37.826
So here's my HTML.

26
00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:41.748
If you just click on that, this will
just open just word masters here, right?

27
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.591
And you don't have to match
my design precisely either.

28
00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:54.433
I gave you a design for this, you're
welcome to kinda be creative with this.

29
00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:57.694
I always think it's fun to be creative.

30
00:01:57.694 --> 00:02:00.856
And then here is my JavaScript,
and here is my CSS.

31
00:02:04.248 --> 00:02:11.596
Okay, any questions about the project,
how it works, any of these kind of things?

32
00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:17.524
AJAX requests, obviously AJAX requests
are gonna be very important Again,

33
00:02:17.524 --> 00:02:22.427
I'm gonna implore you to do the Validate
word, this post part of it.

34
00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:23.859
Do that last, right?

35
00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.043
Just let people guess invalid
words until you get to that point.

36
00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:33.395
That's that's how I did it, and
then I went and added that very last.

37
00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:35.843
Obviously, you have to do the GET,
immediately, right?

38
00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:37.212
Cuz you need the correct word of the day.

39
00:02:37.212 --> 00:02:43.197
But yeah, I would just let people
guess invalid words first.
