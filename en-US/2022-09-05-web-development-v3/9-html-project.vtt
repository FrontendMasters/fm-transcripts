1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.146
So you gonna make your personal blog.

2
00:00:03.146 --> 00:00:06.095
I started that last project
in the previous section so

3
00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:09.239
that you can kinda get started
with like that skeleton and

4
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.400
multiple different pages to
navigate back and forth to.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.227
So here's your project requirements,
your blog has two pages and an index and

6
00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:19.147
an about page.

7
00:00:19.147 --> 00:00:25.019
Your index needs a title of some variety,
my cool blog, or my thoughts,

8
00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.140
or something like that and
some sort of like, hi, how are you?

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.031
Welcome to my blog, and
it needs a link to an about page,

10
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:39.000
your blog must have at
least five posts on it.

11
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.821
Just keep it on the same page, it doesn't
have to like link off to other pages or

12
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:43.520
anything like that.

13
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.450
Each post needs a title and
author, the date it was posted,

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.520
the text of the blog post.

15
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.197
You can use this lorem ipsum
generator to generate text,

16
00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:58.867
you can come in here and just say like,
I want five paragraphs generate,

17
00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:02.252
here and
I'll give you a bunch of paragraphs right?

18
00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:08.974
I'm pretty sure you can actually just say,

19
00:01:08.974 --> 00:01:13.990
in here in VS code, if I just say
Lorem 40 and I hit tab, yeah,

20
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.460
it'll give me Lorem ipsum and
it'll give me 40 words.

21
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.257
So if I say Lorem 10, It'll give me 10
words, that's another really easy way of

22
00:01:24.257 --> 00:01:29.705
doing that Okay,

23
00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:34.179
so you need the text of your blog post and
bonus points for images.

24
00:01:36.405 --> 00:01:39.805
Your about page is the name of your blog,

25
00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:45.020
few paragraphs about who you are,
that kind of stuff.

26
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.186
And I need you to use a list cuz I want
you to use a list element specifically

27
00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:55.271
[LAUGH] of your recent job, or
recent schooling, or accomplishments or

28
00:01:55.271 --> 00:01:59.875
whatever you feel like putting in
a list of some variety please.

29
00:02:02.512 --> 00:02:06.130
And, yeah, so
this will be mostly black and white.

30
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.469
This is totally atone your own
interpretation, it's very loose in your

31
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.410
structuring because I want you
to kind of be creative with it.

32
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.220
This is mine, right?

33
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.408
Brian's blog,
got some posts with Luna on it.

34
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:24.000
You can see that it has lorem ipsum text
in here, it's gonna look something like

35
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.670
this because there's gonna be
no style associated with it yet.

36
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.957
And then if you go here about page,
it'll be another one here, right?

37
00:02:35.538 --> 00:02:36.238
Okay.

38
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.408
So, if you wanna see my answer to it,
which I want you to try

39
00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:50.640
this your yourself first
before you look at my answer.

40
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.364
I think it's important to try things,
struggle, try and figure them out cuz I

41
00:02:54.364 --> 00:02:57.760
think there's a lot of learning there
in that like moment of struggle.

42
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.387
But I'm not your mom, right, like you can
go look at the answer if you want to,

43
00:03:04.387 --> 00:03:08.535
if you're gonna learn better by just
looking at the answer then do that.

44
00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:13.187
This entire thing is about learning, it's
not about cheating or not cheating, it's

45
00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:17.660
like if you end up at the end learning it,
I don't care you get to get there, right?

46
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.583
So do whatever is best for
your capabilities, but

47
00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:24.480
I'm going to advise you that most
students that I've observed and

48
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.740
myself included in this meet need
to struggle a little bit, right?

49
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.734
But don't struggle so
much that you get discouraged,

50
00:03:31.734 --> 00:03:35.132
if you're gonna get that far
just look at the answer, right?

51
00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:38.380
And if you get stuck ask your neighbor,

52
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.120
go Google it, ask your neighbor,
go on Stack Overflow.

53
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.944
Whatever you need to
get you to the answer,

54
00:03:45.944 --> 00:03:49.172
do that thing,
that's what I'm trying to say.

55
00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:53.346
For those who don't know how to do that,
if you right click here and say,

56
00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:57.630
View Page Source, this will show you
the HTML on any given page, right?

57
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.960
So if you click this,
you will see my source code, so

58
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.870
that's where the answer is.

59
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.748
So what you'll do is you'll
click on Brian's blog,

60
00:04:07.748 --> 00:04:11.931
right click View Page Source and
you will see my answer too.

61
00:04:11.931 --> 00:04:16.626
&gt;&gt; If you were really making this,
you would want to use a content

62
00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:21.900
management system if something
that's doing like posts.

63
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.977
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, it depends, right like.

64
00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:31.880
This course website,
arguably it's a bunch of posts right?

65
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.056
And I didn't have any sort of CMS for
it, it's just it's written in Markdown.

66
00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:42.728
So GitHub slash BT hold slash
complete intro to web dev, and

67
00:04:42.728 --> 00:04:45.355
if you'll go here here lessons.

68
00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:49.865
I guess arguably, this is my
content management system, right?

69
00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:54.110
But if you just click on like HTML here,
And

70
00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.531
this is what it actually
looks like written out, so

71
00:04:57.531 --> 00:05:01.918
this is what I actually write which
gets turned into the website.

72
00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:06.700
&gt;&gt; And that's through next right?

73
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:08.581
&gt;&gt; .That's through next JAS, but

74
00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:13.231
anything can read markdown markdown it's
just a flavor of writing text, right?

75
00:05:13.231 --> 00:05:16.538
So this actually used to use
Gatsby to generate this,

76
00:05:16.538 --> 00:05:19.915
now I use next JAS I tried remix,
Jekyll would do this,

77
00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:25.035
Hugo would do it You could
do this with Contentful,

78
00:05:25.035 --> 00:05:29.127
you could do it with WordPress,
you could do it with any number of things,

79
00:05:29.127 --> 00:05:32.833
there's so many correct ways to
do this that it's unbelievable.

80
00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:38.199
I like writing mark down so
I do it this way, but we'll come back and

81
00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:44.084
go through my answer.
