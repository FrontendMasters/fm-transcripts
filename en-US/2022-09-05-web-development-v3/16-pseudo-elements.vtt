00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.193
Let's talk a second about pseudo elements.

2
00:00:02.193 --> 00:00:06.100
I'm not gonna dwell too much on these,
I just want you to see them.

3
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.127
So let's say I had this chapter book kind
of thing, I don't know if you've read

4
00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:15.869
a book and there's a little like flare
at the end of every chapter, right?

5
00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.373
There's some little signatory
like a little picture, right?

6
00:00:20.373 --> 00:00:22.937
Frequently it looks like this, this is
called a fleuron., which I had to look up

7
00:00:22.937 --> 00:00:24.992
for this class cuz I actually did
not know what they were called.

8
00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:30.546
It took me a while Googling
weird things to figure it out.

9
00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:34.780
Picture, icon,
you sometimes see at end of chapter book,

10
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.434
yeah, anyway I found it,
it's called a fleuron.

11
00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:42.578
So notice I look at my CSS here,
I have a div, that's a class chapter.

12
00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:45.488
And I have nothing underneath them.

13
00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:49.886
But I wanna make this little fleurons
thing show up at the end of every chapter

14
00:00:49.886 --> 00:00:50.789
here, right?

15
00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.151
What you can do is you can use
what's called a pseudo element.

16
00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:02.654
So notice that I have two colons here,
that's how you know it's a pseudo element.

17
00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:10.770
I can then select this hidden elements
that exists after every single element.

18
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.100
First you tell it the content.

19
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.601
So this can be, Literally anything, right?

20
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:20.919
So you can put anything in there, right?

21
00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:24.312
And then I can style it however I want.

22
00:01:24.312 --> 00:01:26.665
I can make it color red, right?

23
00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:28.718
You can style it however you want.

24
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:32.351
Put this back in here.

25
00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:38.161
That's what you would use
a pseudo element for.

26
00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:39.849
So, there's before and after,

27
00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.515
those are the two that come
most of mine of what I use.

28
00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:46.242
A good example is like this
result thing that I have right

29
00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:48.871
here that shows the top of this border.

30
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:52.411
This is actually a pseudo
element that I put result and

31
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:57.304
so that people can know that this is
the result of the HTML up here, right?

32
00:01:57.304 --> 00:02:00.631
So that's when you would use
something like a pseudo element.

33
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:05.332
Something that you want to stylistically
display to know what it actually is.

34
00:02:08.473 --> 00:02:09.794
Does that make some sense?

35
00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:13.978
You can get by,
by never using pseudo elements.

36
00:02:13.978 --> 00:02:20.709
But I wanted to show you cuz they're out
there and sometimes people will use them.

37
00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.140
Technically one colon would be valid here.

38
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.145
Notice that this still works,.

39
00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:30.221
That's because the old way of pseudo
classes and pseudo elements used to not

40
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:34.050
be different, they used to be,
I think they were both pseudo classes.

41
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.930
But they eventually ended up changing
them so that they're now different,

42
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.735
there's pseudo elements and
pseudo classes.

43
00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:39.363
They're different.

44
00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.895
And that's why we prefer
now to use two colons so

45
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:46.137
that we know everything with one colon
is pseudo elements, sorry, everything

46
00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:50.274
with one colon as pseudo classes and
everything with two is pseudo elements.

47
00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:55.250
You'll notice one thing with the Web Dev
is that they never break things.

48
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.200
They always want old websites to work.

49
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.984
Like famously the Space Jam
website worked for 20 years or

50
00:03:02.984 --> 00:03:09.118
something like that longer,
longer than 20 years, in modern browsers.

51
00:03:09.118 --> 00:03:11.273
And that's because they
try not to break anything.

52
00:03:14.754 --> 00:03:20.801
Okay, Yeah, now, one fun

53
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:25.517
fact is you can totally use CSS to style
books and newspapers and things like that.

54
00:03:25.517 --> 00:03:28.487
I know a lot of books these
days are styled with CSS,

55
00:03:28.487 --> 00:03:30.361
that's called print layouts.

56
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.218
Okay, that's it for
pseudo classes and pseudo elements.

57
00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:37.790
Any questions about that?

58
00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:47.954
Pseudo classes, we use all the time,
like hover states,

59
00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:52.828
and focus dates, and
nth child, and first child.

60
00:03:52.828 --> 00:03:55.673
Yeah, one thing I didn't show
you here is we did first child.

61
00:03:55.673 --> 00:03:58.195
You can also do nth child.

62
00:04:00.306 --> 00:04:02.091
So now the second one, right?

63
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:03.041
nth is just like the numberth,
right, nth child.

64
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:10.311
You can also give it a formula, right?

65
00:04:10.311 --> 00:04:13.216
So like if I said,
let's get a fourth one here.

66
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:23.767
If I say 2n,
now it's every other one, right?

67
00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:28.429
So the n is giving it
like a equation to use.

68
00:04:28.429 --> 00:04:33.890
You could do 2n-1, and
now it's the odd ones, right?

69
00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:40.200
You can get really wild, like 1- 2n.

70
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.584
Now you gotta remember, maybe it's -n + 1.

71
00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.748
There we go.

72
00:04:58.748 --> 00:05:03.703
So it's trying to do so like,
Do you want it to do all

73
00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:08.012
of the ones that are from two and
below that's how you would do it this way.

74
00:05:08.012 --> 00:05:13.219
So you can give it all sorts of fun
stuff if you need to do crazy selectors.

75
00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.766
You should never have to really know that,
but It's there and

76
00:05:17.766 --> 00:05:19.698
available if you need to.

77
00:05:19.698 --> 00:05:22.283
Yeah, this kind of stuff is useful.

78
00:05:22.283 --> 00:05:24.230
Pseudo elements, I very rarely use them.
