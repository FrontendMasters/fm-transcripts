1
00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:06.126
Tables, sometimes you have
tabular data like this, right?.

2
00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:10.481
Maybe you're making, I don't like
the standings of the current NBA teams,

3
00:00:10.481 --> 00:00:12.500
the way you have that in the tables.

4
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.729
This is the Utah Jazz, they have this
many wins, this many losses, and

5
00:00:16.729 --> 00:00:18.999
that would be a table of information.

6
00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.340
Something that you could use a spreadsheet
for, tables are really useful for

7
00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.097
that kind of stuff and
we call that tabular data.

8
00:00:26.097 --> 00:00:29.531
And so I just wanted to show you
here how you would lay one out.

9
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:32.781
So I have a table tag,
and inside of that table,

10
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:36.533
I have a body cuz you can also
technically have a thead.

11
00:00:40.202 --> 00:00:44.677
And I'll just show you that,
If you wanna see.

12
00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:49.840
So here, we can have another table row,
which is a tr,

13
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.133
and this will have td of,
I don't know, some heading.

14
00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:04.093
And this would have a td
of some other heading.

15
00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:09.759
Okay, and so now I have,
if you're doing a spreadsheet,

16
00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.099
you can name the different columns.

17
00:01:12.099 --> 00:01:16.773
That's what a thead is for,
is to name all the different columns here.

18
00:01:16.773 --> 00:01:24.157
So I don't know,
maybe this is names and points.

19
00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:28.984
Imagine that we're doing trivia night or
something like that and

20
00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:35.490
you're keeping track of Team 1's points or
Team Awesome, and they have 50 points.

21
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.216
Well, let's just make it Harry Potter,
my wife would be so

22
00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:40.245
happy that I used
the Harry Potter analogy.

23
00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:45.134
So this is Ravenclaw, obviously, and

24
00:01:45.134 --> 00:01:51.960
this is Slytherin,
I think I spelled that correctly.

25
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.960
I'm a Ravenclaw, so I would
typically put myself as winning, but

26
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.890
my wife is a Slytherin, so I probably
should make her win, so a Slytherin's win,

27
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.547
just by the fact that
I'm afraid of my wife.

28
00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:08.248
So you can see here I kind of
just created a basic spreadsheet

29
00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:12.017
inside of my code using this table tag,
right?

30
00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:16.440
So the thead to express
what the column names are,

31
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.983
and then I just used this
to express which is which.

32
00:02:20.983 --> 00:02:24.797
So tr stands for
table row and td stands for,

33
00:02:24.797 --> 00:02:29.647
I think it's table definition,
but it's like a cell,

34
00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:34.209
it's an individual cell in
whatever your table is.

35
00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:38.928
So there are so many more tags, right?

36
00:02:38.928 --> 00:02:40.933
There's many, many, many tags.

37
00:02:40.933 --> 00:02:45.664
I've shown you probably,
I'm gonna guess 75% usage will be

38
00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:49.513
these very tags that I've shown you,
but there's still some other ones

39
00:02:49.513 --> 00:02:53.002
that sometimes you will throw in for
various different reasons.

40
00:02:53.002 --> 00:02:57.370
And actually, throughout this course,
we'll use more of them,

41
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.118
like article tags and
section tags and things like that.

42
00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:05.768
But one thing I wanna emphasize to you,
technically you could use a div for

43
00:03:05.768 --> 00:03:07.044
anything, right?

44
00:03:07.044 --> 00:03:11.377
You can make everything, 100% of your
tags on your page could be a div, right?

45
00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:15.356
A div is cardboard box and
you can make various different cardboard

46
00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:18.062
boxes into your cardboard
fort of a website.

47
00:03:18.062 --> 00:03:21.884
But it's important to use the thing
that matches it the closest, right?

48
00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:26.549
So if I start using headings,
right, if I have an h1 on a site,

49
00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.305
then some sort of assistive technology,
like a screen reader,

50
00:03:31.305 --> 00:03:34.914
can go find the h1 on
the website to tell a blind or

51
00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:39.166
a hard of seeing person,
this is the name of the website.

52
00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:42.123
Cuz it's going to look for
h1s on your page.

53
00:03:42.123 --> 00:03:45.789
This is called writing semantic markup or
semantic HTML.

54
00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.505
By just following those
kind of best practices,

55
00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:51.753
all of the assistive technology
will just work for free and

56
00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:55.675
you don't have to do a lot of work to
make your site work for everybody.

57
00:03:55.675 --> 00:04:00.119
Otherwise, you have to do a ton of work
to say, all right, screen readers,

58
00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:04.994
come here, this is what this does, this
is what this does, and it's really hard.

59
00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.725
I'll leave it at that.

60
00:04:06.725 --> 00:04:10.853
Try and choose tags that match your
meaning, that's my plea to you.

61
00:04:10.853 --> 00:04:14.247
And then take the Frontend Masters
course on accessibility,

62
00:04:14.247 --> 00:04:18.226
which will really gets you into depth
of how to do the best kind of markup,

63
00:04:18.226 --> 00:04:20.985
in addition to a bunch of
other really cool stuff.

64
00:04:23.494 --> 00:04:28.218
So I just wanted to show you one here for
fun cuz I just entertained myself with it.

65
00:04:28.218 --> 00:04:32.502
Do you remember the MySpace,
GeoCities, Angelfire days,

66
00:04:32.502 --> 00:04:35.107
where we would have scrolling text?

67
00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:38.369
There is technically a tag
here called the marquee tag.

68
00:04:38.369 --> 00:04:43.439
It's old, it's deprecated, which means
it's been removed technically from HTML.

69
00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:48.994
But still, Firefox and
Chrome still understand the marquee tag.

70
00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:50.645
I love that it's super janky.

71
00:04:50.645 --> 00:04:54.057
And they do that on purpose, because it's
actually how it used to look, right?

72
00:04:54.057 --> 00:04:56.473
If you look at this in Chrome,
it's actually nice and smooth,

73
00:04:56.473 --> 00:04:57.711
which is not how it used to look.

74
00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:01.986
It used to be janky, and it needs to be
janky for it to be correct in my eyes.

75
00:05:04.694 --> 00:05:07.932
So there's a bunch of stuff like that,
there used to be a blink tag.

76
00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:12.190
The blink tag has gone away, thankfully,
cuz it was annoying as hell.

77
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.823
There's a bunch of other ones that
we could talk about, but yeah,

78
00:05:14.823 --> 00:05:17.046
I like the Marquee tag,
that one always entertains me.

79
00:05:17.046 --> 00:05:19.643
So let's talk about comments.

80
00:05:19.643 --> 00:05:23.964
VS Code get all this context built into
our brains while we're writing some

81
00:05:23.964 --> 00:05:24.865
code, right?

82
00:05:24.865 --> 00:05:29.243
So you have all these thoughts, I'm doing
this, I'm doing this, I broke this,

83
00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:32.806
I fixed this, and you get all this
built-up context in your head.

84
00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:37.182
And then you leave, and you go back and
you come back the next day, right?

85
00:05:37.182 --> 00:05:39.453
And you've lost all that context.

86
00:05:39.453 --> 00:05:43.819
Imagine it's like writing an essay and
you do a bunch of research, and

87
00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:48.566
then you leave and you try and come back
and continue your essay a week later.

88
00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:53.789
You've lost all that context, you have to
work again to regain all of that context.

89
00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.374
That's hard, right?

90
00:05:55.374 --> 00:05:58.543
So there's a thing that coders
can do called comments.

91
00:05:58.543 --> 00:06:02.467
And actually, you can see I spoiled that,
this is a comment right here.

92
00:06:02.467 --> 00:06:06.510
You can leave comments in your code that
never gets shown to the user, right?

93
00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.265
But it's actually just left there for
future coders and

94
00:06:09.265 --> 00:06:12.670
your future self to be like that's
why I did this thing, right?

95
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.263
So if I wanted to leave a comment here of,

96
00:06:16.263 --> 00:06:20.705
this is from Harry Potter or
something like that,

97
00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:26.943
I can actually just put a little
comment here of angle bracket !--,

98
00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:32.698
which you can see, this is my
ligature that I was talking about.

99
00:06:32.698 --> 00:06:37.690
This is actually just an angle bracket,
an exclamation point, and

100
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.854
two dashes all next to each other, right?

101
00:06:40.854 --> 00:06:44.104
And then as soon I hit backspace here,

102
00:06:44.104 --> 00:06:48.784
this is just my font combining
them all into one gliff.

103
00:06:48.784 --> 00:06:51.672
It's called a ligature,
and I left a link for

104
00:06:51.672 --> 00:06:55.936
it in the previous section or
one of the previous sections, okay?

105
00:06:55.936 --> 00:06:57.936
And so this is a comment.

106
00:06:57.936 --> 00:07:03.131
And the way you finish a comment
is like this, a dash dash,

107
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:08.870
and then angle bracket,
then right-pointing angle bracket.

108
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.699
So if I combine these into one,
it makes just a really long arrow,

109
00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.220
these things together all make a comment.

110
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.622
And this can be multiline as well, right?

111
00:07:16.622 --> 00:07:19.406
So I can have more stuff here.

112
00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:21.638
And this can just be
whatever you wanna put here,

113
00:07:21.638 --> 00:07:23.662
there's no legal stuff
to put in a comment.

114
00:07:23.662 --> 00:07:28.365
It's all just whatever
stuff you would wanna put.

115
00:07:28.365 --> 00:07:30.683
So again, what I could have put here is,

116
00:07:35.281 --> 00:07:41.758
These are the scores from
the Harry Potter houses or

117
00:07:41.758 --> 00:07:45.681
something like that, right?

118
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:48.816
And now, if I come back later
to this code, I can see, okay,

119
00:07:48.816 --> 00:07:51.339
that's what I was thinking
when I did this, right?

120
00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.248
That's the point of comments.

121
00:07:53.248 --> 00:07:56.398
And throughout this course,
we'll do a lot of commenting,

122
00:07:56.398 --> 00:07:59.319
we'll show that on CSS,
we'll show it in JavaScript.

123
00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:02.686
It's really important for you to leave
these little future notes to someone,

124
00:08:02.686 --> 00:08:04.228
it's like, this is why I did this.

125
00:08:04.228 --> 00:08:08.494
If you're writing code and you know later
that this is gonna be unclear why I did it

126
00:08:08.494 --> 00:08:12.777
this way, you'll wanna leave a comment of,
I did this this way for this reason.

127
00:08:12.777 --> 00:08:16.349
So that when you come back to it,
you're not gonna say,

128
00:08:16.349 --> 00:08:18.944
why was Bryan such an idiot two days ago?

129
00:08:18.944 --> 00:08:23.281
Believe me, it happens all the time,
comments will help you a lot.

130
00:08:25.263 --> 00:08:27.277
So that's what comments are.

131
00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:31.772
I'll give you a warning, right,
leaving comments like this.

132
00:08:31.772 --> 00:08:34.425
If I put an h1 saying
Title of the Article and

133
00:08:34.425 --> 00:08:38.801
then I leave a comment right underneath
it that says, this is the title,

134
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:42.057
by putting it in h1,
I know it's the title, right?

135
00:08:42.057 --> 00:08:44.959
So don't leave comments everywhere
just for the sake of comments.

136
00:08:44.959 --> 00:08:47.819
If you're gonna leave a comment,
make it useful, right?

137
00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:50.924
Some things are just very obvious,
they don't need comments.

138
00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:55.868
So somewhere of the balance of
between way too obvious and

139
00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.551
leaving no comments, right?

140
00:08:58.551 --> 00:09:02.323
You wanna make sure that you're leaving
an appropriate amount of comments.

141
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:11.381
Okay, so I just wanted to give
you a note on hard returns.

142
00:09:11.381 --> 00:09:16.381
So this is something that I struggled
with when I was learning HTML, so

143
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:20.807
hopefully, I can kind of help you
not do the same things I did.

144
00:09:20.807 --> 00:09:26.819
If you write this in your HTML,
what do you expect to happen?

145
00:09:26.819 --> 00:09:31.691
I personally, if I didn't know HTML
previous to this, I would expect it to be,

146
00:09:31.691 --> 00:09:35.423
this is some text, a space,
this is some more text, right?

147
00:09:35.423 --> 00:09:38.877
I'd expect there to be a paragraph
between the two of those.

148
00:09:38.877 --> 00:09:41.365
That's not actually how HTML works.

149
00:09:41.365 --> 00:09:44.064
HTML is actually going to
squish this into one paragraph.

150
00:09:44.064 --> 00:09:45.451
In fact, you can see that right here.

151
00:09:47.297 --> 00:09:50.925
So this actually squished it
together all into one paragraph.

152
00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:55.665
So yeah, this squished it
together into all one line,

153
00:09:55.665 --> 00:10:00.723
because HTML is not going to
respect the whitespace here.

154
00:10:00.723 --> 00:10:05.230
So how would I get that split correctly?

155
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:06.859
Well, I'm gonna show you two
different ways to do it.

156
00:10:06.859 --> 00:10:08.436
There's a kind of
a correct way to do it and

157
00:10:08.436 --> 00:10:10.069
there's kind of an incorrect way to do it.

158
00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:13.388
You'll see both, and I wanna
implore you to use one of them, but

159
00:10:13.388 --> 00:10:17.093
I'll show you both ways to do it and
you can make the decision yourself.

160
00:10:17.093 --> 00:10:20.389
The correct way of doing this is
this is two paragraphs, right?

161
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:22.983
This is two paragraphs of text.

162
00:10:22.983 --> 00:10:24.759
We expect it to be two paragraphs,

163
00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:27.773
therefore we should just use
two paragraph tags, right?

164
00:10:27.773 --> 00:10:30.364
So we should do it this way.

165
00:10:31.595 --> 00:10:34.144
This is some text, some space.

166
00:10:34.144 --> 00:10:35.733
Well, actually,
the space there isn't even important.

167
00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:41.096
Just the fact that it's in two
different paragraphs will make it so

168
00:10:41.096 --> 00:10:44.269
that these work the way that we expect.

169
00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:48.860
So just make it two different paragraphs
rather than than trying to make this into

170
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.220
one paragraph, okay?

171
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.882
I want you to do it this way,
this is what I'm asking you to do,

172
00:10:52.882 --> 00:10:53.974
I hope you do it this way.

173
00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:56.371
Now, I'm gonna show you how
to do it the wrong way.

174
00:10:56.371 --> 00:11:00.077
If you really have to do it in
one paragraph for some reason,

175
00:11:00.077 --> 00:11:03.877
there is another tag called the br,
which stands for break.

176
00:11:03.877 --> 00:11:05.827
This will make a break in your text.

177
00:11:09.015 --> 00:11:13.153
This is the old way of writing HTML,
people used to write a lot of HTML.

178
00:11:13.153 --> 00:11:17.958
I will tell you that if you go to
Netflix.com, there are zero break text.

179
00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:22.024
So modern HTML programmers
do not use break,

180
00:11:22.024 --> 00:11:27.593
they'll just put this into
multiple different paragraphs.

181
00:11:27.593 --> 00:11:29.856
But I show you this for two reasons, one,

182
00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:34.512
sometimes you might have some constraints
that this might be useful to you, and two,

183
00:11:34.512 --> 00:11:36.919
you will definitely see
it on the Internet.

184
00:11:36.919 --> 00:11:42.109
If you're Googling how do I do this, it
might show up in one of the answers, and I

185
00:11:42.109 --> 00:11:47.782
don't want you to be startled by something
that you didn't see or anticipate before.

186
00:11:47.782 --> 00:11:50.722
So this is correct.

187
00:11:50.722 --> 00:11:52.521
Do two paragraphs tag.

188
00:11:52.521 --> 00:11:55.934
This technically works, but
I'm gonna say incorrect.

189
00:12:00.745 --> 00:12:02.660
So br tags used to be very common.

190
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.451
If you go to old websites,
they'll still exist.

191
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:13.979
But it's not anymore, most websites
don't use them at all anymore.

192
00:12:13.979 --> 00:12:17.806
And this is just kind of a common theme
with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for

193
00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:20.851
that matter,
is we're trying not to break the Internet.

194
00:12:20.851 --> 00:12:26.831
So every time that we, and
I say we as in the collective community.

195
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:31.540
Every time that they release new
versions of HTML and CSS and

196
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:35.401
JavaScript, they add
things to the language and

197
00:12:35.401 --> 00:12:40.506
to the new capabilities, but
they don't take away old things.

198
00:12:40.506 --> 00:12:43.941
Because they want websites
from 1995 to work.

199
00:12:43.941 --> 00:12:48.197
If you launch a website today, you
anticipate and you want that your website

200
00:12:48.197 --> 00:12:52.536
will work for 30 more years,
50 more years, and that's what they want.

201
00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:55.084
So that's the positive thing,
is websites never break.

202
00:12:55.084 --> 00:12:57.976
The negative thing is we
are now left with a bunch

203
00:12:57.976 --> 00:13:01.086
of really old stuff that
still technically works,

204
00:13:01.086 --> 00:13:05.004
and it becomes less clear what's
the correct way of doing this.

205
00:13:06.976 --> 00:13:11.445
So a break tag is one of those
things that's leftover from

206
00:13:11.445 --> 00:13:15.085
an ancient era of all
these different things.

207
00:13:15.085 --> 00:13:17.174
So this is not the preferred
way of doing it.

208
00:13:17.174 --> 00:13:20.129
I'm telling you that because
it is in there, it exists.

209
00:13:20.129 --> 00:13:25.115
You'll find lots of stuff like this and
we don't use it anymore, but it is there.
