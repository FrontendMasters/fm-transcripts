00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.250
Let's go through some of the CSS now.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.555
So the first thing I did,

3
00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:10.749
do I just have the the let's bring
up the CSS here, which I have here.

4
00:00:14.274 --> 00:00:17.640
Box-sizing: border-box here; that was one
of the first things I told you to do.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.740
Just makes everything
a lot easier to measure.

6
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.075
It probably wouldn't have actually made
a huge difference in this particular case,

7
00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:25.585
but it's just a habit I have.

8
00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:29.494
Okay, the body here margin 0, padding 0,
that makes everything push out to

9
00:00:29.494 --> 00:00:34.330
the side, because by default the body
has a little bit of margin and padding.

10
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.040
Background-color, I got this nice gray.

11
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.375
So a nice little thing that I didn't show
you but would make things a little bit

12
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:45.180
easier, Firefox, at least,
has this little dropper tool here.

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.528
So you can actually do this to
figure out what color things are.

14
00:00:49.456 --> 00:00:54.531
So a lot of things that I did for
the site, What I just did is

15
00:00:54.531 --> 00:00:57.878
I took the eyedropper here and I was like,
what color is the brown that is used here?

16
00:00:57.878 --> 00:01:03.011
So I just did that and then it would copy
that hex value, nice little trick there.

17
00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:09.387
Okay, so that's the background and
then I used Open Sans as the font.

18
00:01:09.387 --> 00:01:11.010
You could have used anything.

19
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.735
I just happen to use Open Sans.

20
00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:20.258
Okay, let's look at the page now,
the page.

21
00:01:20.258 --> 00:01:21.180
It's grid.

22
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.640
That's how I chose to do it.

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.554
And the way I did it,
I did it with a named layout here so

24
00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:33.952
I did order payment, right, so
that this case, this was order,

25
00:01:33.952 --> 00:01:38.888
this was payment and
then down here was, what did I call it?

26
00:01:38.888 --> 00:01:41.421
The total.

27
00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:49.905
And that made for a really nice layout
there, worked out really well for me.

28
00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:53.801
Totally could have done this with Flex,
could have done this differently with

29
00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:57.402
Grid, so you had this maybe was of height
two and this was of height one and

30
00:01:57.402 --> 00:01:59.550
height one, right, and done it that way.

31
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.930
There's a lot of ways that you could
have chosen to have done this.

32
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.710
This worked for me.

33
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.730
Some nice row gaps with padding and
height here.

34
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.051
And notice, I did leave the nap
out of the grid here didn't really

35
00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:21.400
need to be a part of the grid,
cuz I had this go all the way to the side.

36
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.532
So it's got its background color.

37
00:02:24.532 --> 00:02:28.900
I used Flex to get this
Coffee Masters centered, right,

38
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.727
by doing a line items and
justify content center.

39
00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:36.981
Here, particularly with the logo,

40
00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:45.071
I did shift this down a little bit, so I
did position relative to top three pixels.

41
00:02:45.071 --> 00:02:48.148
If you don't,
that logo just sits a little high for me,

42
00:02:48.148 --> 00:02:50.183
I don't know how that feels for you.

43
00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:54.245
I felt like it sat a little too high,
so I just did a position down and

44
00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:58.905
it just moved it down, and that made me
feel a bit better about how it looked.

45
00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:01.831
Just eyeballed it, right,
there's no math or anything here.

46
00:03:05.273 --> 00:03:08.140
So that's what that
position relative top does.

47
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.706
Here's that box class I was talking about.

48
00:03:14.037 --> 00:03:19.993
So this box class that I've used
several times for here, and here.

49
00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:23.944
This way I was able to do this,
if I wanted to change this later,

50
00:03:23.944 --> 00:03:27.001
and I want to make it black for
some weird reason,

51
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:31.520
I change it once,
it changes all of them at the same time.

52
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.971
So I try and
make things as reusable as possible, so

53
00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:40.213
that you can make it the hotdog stand
theme if you want to, totally possible.

54
00:03:45.137 --> 00:03:49.848
Let's just refresh that so it comes back.

55
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.213
Trying to think is there's anything
else that's important about that.

56
00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:02.493
Let's just keep going through
the CSS here, box title, colors.

57
00:04:02.493 --> 00:04:05.255
Here I just named all the various
different grid areas.

58
00:04:09.123 --> 00:04:13.945
You might ask me, could I have
made these IDs instead of classes?

59
00:04:13.945 --> 00:04:17.213
I would be okay if you had
done this as IDs, right.

60
00:04:17.213 --> 00:04:22.056
You only have one order and that grid area
is actually going to be unique to order,

61
00:04:22.056 --> 00:04:22.564
right?

62
00:04:22.564 --> 00:04:25.460
You're not going to reuse
that somewhere else.

63
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.953
I still did it as a class,
because I just do everything as a class,

64
00:04:28.953 --> 00:04:30.470
I never style by ID.

65
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.920
In this case,
I wouldn't look at your code and

66
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.229
be upset if you had
done this by ID though.

67
00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:41.206
Items, Let's look at that,

68
00:04:41.206 --> 00:04:44.612
I think that's kind of
an interesting thing,

69
00:04:44.612 --> 00:04:47.772
the items, this is the list here, right?

70
00:04:47.772 --> 00:04:51.496
So I actually chose to do these in grid,
did the items inside of it,

71
00:04:51.496 --> 00:04:53.101
it made it really easy to do.

72
00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:56.236
So it's a grid.

73
00:04:56.236 --> 00:05:01.127
It has a quantity, title and
price here on top, right?

74
00:05:01.127 --> 00:05:07.209
And then on the bottom,
it's just, Quantity.

75
00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:09.383
So I have this this quantity here.

76
00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:11.956
Notice it takes the entire vertical space,

77
00:05:11.956 --> 00:05:15.023
as well as the price takes
the whole vertical space.

78
00:05:15.023 --> 00:05:19.254
It just makes it so
everything lines up really nicely for

79
00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:23.769
the cappuccino here and
then the items listed inside of it.

80
00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:28.791
But again, you could have done this with
Flex, you could have done it with Floats.

81
00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:31.580
There's a million other ways
you could have done this.

82
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.266
It just happened to work out
really well for Grid, so

83
00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:37.211
I chose to do this interior
little layout here with Grid.

84
00:05:43.044 --> 00:05:45.030
Let's see, what else?
Is there anything else interesting here?

85
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.510
So yeah, quantity, title,
price, and then quantity.

86
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.104
So this made a column here, and then title
and options, where title and options here.

87
00:05:56.405 --> 00:06:02.506
And then price, price, so everything
worked out in really nice grid fashion.

88
00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:15.533
Okay, same thing here, there's this
nice little bottom border here.

89
00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:21.768
And then I used last child to give
that border bottom of none, right.

90
00:06:25.622 --> 00:06:27.850
Trying to think if there's
anything else interesting here.

91
00:06:33.373 --> 00:06:37.350
Yeah, so
let's talk about how I did these inputs,

92
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.507
that's probably interesting as well.

93
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.300
Okay, so I have this input group
as a position relative, right, so

94
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.923
anything that I do position absolute
will be relative to the input group.

95
00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:53.357
If I take that off,

96
00:06:53.357 --> 00:06:58.756
notice that everything ended up here
in the top left of the entire page.

97
00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:03.820
Now the position relative, or sorry,
the position absolute of the label

98
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.139
is relative to the entire page, right,
so everything ends up here, right.

99
00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.799
So that's why I needed
the position relative here to

100
00:07:11.799 --> 00:07:14.346
make it relative to
the individual input groups.

101
00:07:17.372 --> 00:07:25.920
Okay, then the label is position absolute
relative to the input group again, right?

102
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.984
And then I just have to go from the left,
come in 25 pixels and

103
00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:32.260
from the top, go up seven pixels.

104
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.360
That's what the -7 means,
because if I don't do that it pushes down

105
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.080
like that which you don't want that,
right.

106
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.214
And if I had done 7 pixels, it would
put it from the top go down 7 pixels,

107
00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:48.565
which obviously in the middle of it,
that's not what we're looking for at all.

108
00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:54.675
So -7 pixels kinda gets into
that right place, yeah.

109
00:07:56.785 --> 00:08:01.275
I guess, technically,
you could have gone from

110
00:08:01.275 --> 00:08:06.201
the bottom if you wanted to
use positive numbers, and

111
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:12.679
then it would have to be 30 pixels,
33ish, 2, that looks nice.

112
00:08:12.679 --> 00:08:16.814
Right, cuz you're saying from the bottom,
go up 32 pixels.

113
00:08:16.814 --> 00:08:20.781
I would prefer the smaller number of using
top, that just makes more sense to me

114
00:08:20.781 --> 00:08:23.980
because it is relative to the top,
not relative to the bottom.

115
00:08:26.108 --> 00:08:28.248
But I guess that's just
taste at that point.

116
00:08:31.703 --> 00:08:33.103
Give it some padding on the ends.

117
00:08:33.103 --> 00:08:38.742
That's always something that, yeah, to
give it that kind of nice little cut off.

118
00:08:40.455 --> 00:08:45.368
I think I just guess and checked here,
three probably would have been fine here?

119
00:08:45.368 --> 00:08:47.750
Four looks like it's
kind of maybe too much.

120
00:08:51.327 --> 00:08:53.381
Could have given a lot,
I don't know, up to you.

121
00:08:55.707 --> 00:09:00.155
Okay, and then for the input here, so

122
00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:07.672
this background color here,
I did the rgba of (0,0,0).

123
00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:12.199
So I think you're probably familiar
with rgb, right, red, green, blue, but

124
00:09:12.199 --> 00:09:13.608
there is an rgba as well.

125
00:09:13.608 --> 00:09:17.840
The a stands for alpha and
alpha just means transparency.

126
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:23.173
So if I do one here, it's actually gonna
make the background black, I think, right?

127
00:09:23.173 --> 00:09:29.636
So 0,0,0 which is 0 red, 0 green,
0 blue is the color, black, right?

128
00:09:29.636 --> 00:09:33.679
As opposed to 255, 255,
255 is all of the red,

129
00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:37.740
all of the green,
all of the blue which is white, right?

130
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.353
Then you have this last number
which is between 0 and 1.

131
00:09:42.353 --> 00:09:47.456
0 is totally transparent, 1 is totally
opaque and if I do 0.5 here, right,

132
00:09:47.456 --> 00:09:52.348
it's kind of great because now it's
actually semi-transparent, right?

133
00:09:52.348 --> 00:09:57.280
So it's mixing that black with
that background beige ish color.

134
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.593
But I just wanted this to
have like no background and

135
00:10:00.593 --> 00:10:03.920
I wanted it to take on the appearance
of whatever is behind it.

136
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.066
So I just gave it this 0,0,0,
and then now that background,

137
00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:10.213
it's technically black, but
it's just totally transparent,

138
00:10:10.213 --> 00:10:12.917
right, which means it picks
up that background color.

139
00:10:12.917 --> 00:10:16.083
The other thing you could have
done is I could have just said,

140
00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.520
what's the color of this?

141
00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.740
And then background color, blah.

142
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.366
And now it does actually
have a background but

143
00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:28.510
that background is the correct color,
right?

144
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.590
It matches the background color.

145
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.743
So I'm showing you just two different
techniques you could have achieved that

146
00:10:33.743 --> 00:10:35.043
same kind of background color.

147
00:10:37.662 --> 00:10:41.645
Okay, the padding, I did that because
otherwise, it's really squished together.

148
00:10:41.645 --> 00:10:44.900
That didn't look as pleasant to me,
it also doesn't match the design.

149
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.880
So by giving it some padding, now it's
got some space to work around with.

150
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.540
Border radius 100 pixel, if you don't
do that, then it's like a square thing.

151
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.930
Again, that doesn't match the designs.

152
00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.370
The designs called for rounded corners.

153
00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:03.218
So if you give it a really large number,
I think you give this 1000 pixels,

154
00:11:03.218 --> 00:11:08.004
at some point, it's so round, it just
becomes all the way rounded, right?

155
00:11:13.429 --> 00:11:17.190
But if I do, I don't know, 10 pixels,

156
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.388
right, it's not as rounded
as it needs to be.

157
00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:23.351
I don't know,
at what point is it totally round?

158
00:11:25.162 --> 00:11:31.699
100 is probably too much, yeah,
around 20 pixels it becomes totally round.

159
00:11:31.699 --> 00:11:35.785
Another fun thing you can do, which this
is obviously not what you should do, but

160
00:11:35.785 --> 00:11:38.910
if you do percentages,
you'll actually make it like ovals,

161
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.735
which is just horrendous, right?

162
00:11:40.735 --> 00:11:46.929
It's just a fun tip to know,
sometimes that's useful.

163
00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:54.529
Well, for example, sometimes you
might want to make a div a circle,

164
00:11:54.529 --> 00:11:57.995
let's see if I can show
you that really quick.

165
00:11:57.995 --> 00:12:03.333
Let's just, Here underneath the body,

166
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:06.566
underneath this total section,
there we go.

167
00:12:09.168 --> 00:12:11.014
Edit as HTML.

168
00:12:15.292 --> 00:12:16.660
Let's add a div.

169
00:12:23.875 --> 00:12:28.402
Okay, and then here, give it a height,

170
00:12:28.402 --> 00:12:33.071
100 pixels, width, 100 pixels.

171
00:12:35.143 --> 00:12:38.700
I'm editing the wrong thing,
whatever, that's fine.

172
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:40.270
I wanna edit this one.

173
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.214
So width, 100 pixels, height,

174
00:12:45.214 --> 00:12:49.058
100 pixels, background color,

175
00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:54.150
red because that'll be super visible,
right.

176
00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:59.178
So now I have this square that I have just
created, it's just some random square.

177
00:12:59.178 --> 00:13:03.917
And if I wanted to make this round,
you would just do border radius,

178
00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:07.840
100%, and
that'll make a perfect circle for you.

179
00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:14.330
As opposed to, I think if I did 100
pixels, no, it'll still be round.

180
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.458
So but by the percentages,
no matter where I'll put inside there,

181
00:13:18.458 --> 00:13:20.709
it'll still maintain
somewhat its round shape.

182
00:13:25.058 --> 00:13:28.518
Yeah, anyway,
fun tricks if you need to do things.

183
00:13:30.538 --> 00:13:31.734
Stretch it out, all that kind of stuff.

184
00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:34.313
That was the label, we talked about that.

185
00:13:37.091 --> 00:13:43.474
The total, I did this with Flex because,
let's see, going into the total here.

186
00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:47.768
This is flex here, you can see that.

187
00:13:47.768 --> 00:13:49.736
I did Flex direction and column, so

188
00:13:49.736 --> 00:13:52.760
everything kind of laid
out well into a column.

189
00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.543
I didn't even necessarily have to do that,

190
00:13:55.543 --> 00:14:00.144
this would have been just as easy to
do with normal divs and block layout.

191
00:14:00.144 --> 00:14:04.944
I think I just did it out of habit because
I know I can center things really easy

192
00:14:04.944 --> 00:14:07.501
with Flex, but that would have worked.

193
00:14:07.501 --> 00:14:13.877
Yeah, you totally could have made the
class list and just given this margins and

194
00:14:13.877 --> 00:14:18.647
that would work just as well,
but Flex made it really easy.

195
00:14:21.058 --> 00:14:26.521
Okay this is a table,
and then here I have a,

196
00:14:26.521 --> 00:14:30.518
it's just a table definition.

197
00:14:30.518 --> 00:14:34.950
So I'll have the TD here, and then here
on the other one to make this work so

198
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.097
that one's left aligned and
one's right aligned,

199
00:14:38.097 --> 00:14:42.460
on the second one you can see
I have the TD last child here.

200
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:44.833
And I just put text
aligned right down there,

201
00:14:44.833 --> 00:14:49.156
otherwise these will left align, which
is not what the designs call for, right.

202
00:14:49.156 --> 00:14:52.671
The design called for these to be
pushed all the way to the right,

203
00:14:52.671 --> 00:14:55.288
so I just did that with
a text align to the right.

204
00:15:00.992 --> 00:15:05.146
Yep, that worked out pretty well, could
have done this a myriad of other ways,

205
00:15:05.146 --> 00:15:08.076
that just happened to be what
occurred to me at the time.

206
00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:13.516
In general, if I see tables that look like
it would fit in a spreadsheet, right,

207
00:15:13.516 --> 00:15:18.830
inside of my designs, I tend to use
tables, but you could totally use divs.

208
00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:23.790
There's also dd and dt tags, which I
don't remember what those stand for,

209
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.658
but basically, here's the definition and

210
00:15:26.658 --> 00:15:29.851
here's the thing that
defines the definition.

211
00:15:29.851 --> 00:15:32.255
Or here's the term and
here's the thing that defines the term.

212
00:15:32.255 --> 00:15:34.390
That's what dt and dt tags are for.

213
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.388
You could have used that as well,
I think that would have been appropriate.

214
00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:42.610
Again, just a million different,
correct ways to do this.

215
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.087
And then our button with some
nice rounded corners again,

216
00:15:48.087 --> 00:15:51.700
with the 100%,
took up the whole thing as well.

217
00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:57.510
You could have done all this with
defined widths, it's like saying,

218
00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:01.836
this is 300 pixels, this is 200 pixels,
and all that kind of stuff.

219
00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:05.740
I like doing things so
that on every screen size it looks okay.

220
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.614
Obviously, if we put this in iPhone,

221
00:16:08.614 --> 00:16:11.530
there's this little thing here that
you can put it into an iPhone mode.

222
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.580
So this is an iPhone 11 Pro.

223
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.920
Obviously, this could use some work,
but it's almost usable, right?

224
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.830
What I would do on mobile here is
I'd make this go items be like

225
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.315
100% width on mobile, and

226
00:16:25.315 --> 00:16:28.820
then the name and the payments would
all be kind of laid out into a column.

227
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:34.264
I wonder if I can just show you how
that would look really quick, hold on.

228
00:16:37.734 --> 00:16:42.719
So basically what you would have is just,
I mean, can I just do this?

229
00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:50.164
Order, Payment,

230
00:16:52.763 --> 00:16:56.870
Total, So

231
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.718
just by changing this, and you can use
CSS to do media queries and media queries

232
00:17:01.718 --> 00:17:06.509
to change what CSS is being displayed,
based on what how wide your screen is.

233
00:17:06.509 --> 00:17:12.221
But with just that, this just became
mobile friendly just like that, right?

234
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:18.585
I don't know what happened to my total,
they're down all the way there.

235
00:17:18.585 --> 00:17:21.820
So I'd have to fudge around with it
because obviously, for whatever reason,

236
00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.791
the height here is not working out for
me, but.

237
00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:29.323
Pretty cool, though, right, it made it
really easy to make this work on a mobile

238
00:17:29.323 --> 00:17:30.692
phone just by changing one property.

239
00:17:35.055 --> 00:17:38.221
Or we can even go down to a smaller phone,
like a iPhone Mini.

240
00:17:42.546 --> 00:17:45.335
There you go, so
that's working a little bit better.

241
00:17:45.335 --> 00:17:47.225
Or this could look fine on iPad, for

242
00:17:47.225 --> 00:17:50.130
example, which would look
something more like this.

243
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:55.496
But I think this is gonna look
better like this on iPad, right?

244
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.952
And you can rotate it,
yeah, all that fun stuff.
