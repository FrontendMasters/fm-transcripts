1
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.980
So here is your project.

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.226
You are gonna do this.

3
00:00:06.226 --> 00:00:09.106
You're gonna make a checkout page for

4
00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:12.893
our imaginary coffee app
called Coffee Masters.

5
00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:14.711
Cuz obviously, coffee or

6
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:19.597
Frontend Masters deserve its own
coffee shop called Coffee Masters.

7
00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:26.555
Here I'm gonna make you do all of
the HTML and the CSS yourself.

8
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:31.990
And anything I'm gonna throw at you,
this is hard.

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.010
I intentionally made this hard because
I want you to learn a lot about this.

10
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.743
Struggle through some things and
see if you can figure them out.

11
00:00:40.593 --> 00:00:43.364
The logos here for Coffee Masters,
you can just download that or

12
00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:45.430
you can link directly to it,
that's up to you.

13
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.003
I didn't talk a lot about
making rounded corners, but

14
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.543
you can just do that with border radius.

15
00:00:57.712 --> 00:00:59.742
There's a link here on the article,

16
00:00:59.742 --> 00:01:03.355
how to do all this various different
ways of doing border radius.

17
00:01:07.646 --> 00:01:10.950
There's so many correct ways to do this.

18
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.430
You can do this with grid.

19
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.300
You can do this with flex.

20
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.390
That's totally up to you.

21
00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.609
You also don't have to be exactly perfect,
that's totally fine as well.

22
00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:31.016
I mean, if you look down here at my
example of it, This is how I did it.

23
00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:33.417
It's not perfect to the exact design,

24
00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:38.690
you'll find that happens very frequently
when you're working with the designer.

25
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.652
They'll give you like a Photoshop
document, or a Figma, or

26
00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:44.650
something like that.

27
00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.797
And you'll come back with
something that's pretty close and

28
00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:48.247
hopefully that's good enough for them.

29
00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:52.488
Sometimes they're pixel pushers and
they'll make you get it correct, but

30
00:01:52.488 --> 00:01:54.152
this is what mine looks like.

31
00:01:54.152 --> 00:01:55.700
These are inputs, right?

32
00:01:58.906 --> 00:01:59.599
Okay.

33
00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:08.120
HTML inputs can be styled
with CSS just as you expect.

34
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.249
We also didn't talk about box shadows.

35
00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:14.592
But there's another thing in here if you
wanna add a box shadow to something.

36
00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:16.717
So this will get into
how to do box shadows,

37
00:02:16.717 --> 00:02:18.797
it's one of the least important things.

38
00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:21.777
But a box shadow you can see here,
particularly for

39
00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:26.210
things like that we want something to
look like a little raised off the page,

40
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.995
skeuomorphic, that's
how you would do that.

41
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.185
I took about 100 lines of
HTML to write all of it,

42
00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:39.765
all of this about 150 lines of CSS 200,
something like that.

43
00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:46.520
Again, my way is not the correct way,
it's a way to do this.

44
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.668
There's a lot of different
correct ways to do this.

45
00:02:50.668 --> 00:02:54.398
I ended up using both grid and
flex, in several places.

46
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:57.909
So it's up to you of how
you wanna lay those out.

47
00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:02.868
And you don't have to
match the design perfectly

48
00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:07.973
If you look at mine
here on Coffee Masters,

49
00:03:07.973 --> 00:03:12.866
notice this uses a interesting font,
this is called Open Sans.

50
00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:15.365
It's a really common
font created by Google.

51
00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:22.582
The way you'll load Open Sans on
your project is you can go ahead and

52
00:03:22.582 --> 00:03:24.766
just drop this in your head.

53
00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:27.802
Make sure you drop it
before your style tag.

54
00:03:30.013 --> 00:03:34.851
And then you can just add font-Family Open
Sans, sans-serif to this little bit right

55
00:03:34.851 --> 00:03:38.905
here to your body and that'll make
everything on your page be Open Sans.

56
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.308
And it looks like I'll fix a link there,
but Google fonts has so many

57
00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:49.344
different fonts if you wanna load them and
they're all free and for open use.

58
00:03:52.648 --> 00:03:55.665
And then I wanted to show, so one thing
that I thought might be difficult is that

59
00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:58.290
I didn't really show you how to do,
this name for order right here.

60
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.975
How would you do that?

61
00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:05.775
I kind of helped you
a little bit through that.

62
00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:09.583
That I showed you here this is how I
would do it or how I literally did it.

63
00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:16.345
So what this is,
this is actually the label.

64
00:04:16.345 --> 00:04:19.111
So in HTML you can have a label for
inputs,

65
00:04:19.111 --> 00:04:23.314
just tell people what that
particular input is supposed to be.

66
00:04:23.314 --> 00:04:27.269
So you can see here this has example text,
right?

67
00:04:30.026 --> 00:04:34.035
And then all I did is,
use a CSS property called position

68
00:04:34.035 --> 00:04:38.740
to move things around relative
to where they're supposed to be.

69
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:46.171
So all I did was just move
the text on top of the input here.

70
00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:51.513
And then I gave it a white
background to nicely

71
00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:56.866
kind of eclipse the border
in a pleasant way.

72
00:04:56.866 --> 00:05:01.926
If I put this to green, you can see that's

73
00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:05.982
actually the background there.

74
00:05:05.982 --> 00:05:09.410
But if it looks white, it looks like
it's supposed to be there, right.

75
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.129
So I'm using a little bit
of a trick to get it there.

76
00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:16.450
And then,
all I do is move it left and top.

77
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.547
So this is a little counterintuitive.

78
00:05:18.547 --> 00:05:21.645
Top is from the top and
left is from the left.

79
00:05:21.645 --> 00:05:27.135
So if you move something left 25 pixels,
it ends up moving to the right, right?

80
00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:31.205
But you say start from the left and
move to the right this way.

81
00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:35.971
By the same token, if you say right,
let's just do it so you can see it.

82
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:39.252
Right 25 pixels, it starts from
the right and moves it to the left.

83
00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.228
It can be a little counterintuitive.

84
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:51.201
That's what this position absolute does,
is it moves things absolutely.

85
00:05:51.201 --> 00:05:53.811
But the key here is the group here,

86
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:58.314
cited the example group that
has a position relative on it,

87
00:05:58.314 --> 00:06:03.176
which means anything inside of
this set tries to move absolutely

88
00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:07.881
move relative to me rather than
move relatively to my parent.

89
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.600
So if I took this off, Notice it's gone.

90
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.030
I actually don't even know where it went.

91
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.840
Did it go all the way?

92
00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.804
Yeah, it goes all the way to
the top of this particular thing,

93
00:06:16.804 --> 00:06:20.173
because this must have positioned
relative on it for something else.

94
00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:24.686
So make sure you have that
line of position relative.

95
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:32.950
And yeah, I feel pretty good about that.

96
00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:38.130
Any questions about positioning or
trying to achieve the same effect here?

97
00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.818
One of the least important
things about this list,

98
00:06:40.818 --> 00:06:45.250
I want you to get the layout correct,
that's what I'm most concerned about.

99
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.000
Everything else here is
kind of a nice to have.

100
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.626
You might ask me how did I
come up with these values?

101
00:06:50.626 --> 00:06:51.447
Just eyeballed it.

102
00:06:53.618 --> 00:06:57.751
But like knows I can move it 35,
I can move 55, it just moves it over.

103
00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.411
15, 5, at that point it's just taste.

104
00:07:05.065 --> 00:07:10.860
Same thing was 7 pixels, this could
have been 10 but that's too high.

105
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.639
If I do it 3 that's too low,
7 just felt kind of right.

106
00:07:21.994 --> 00:07:26.779
Padding here with 02 pixels that means
the top bottom are gonna have o pixels.

107
00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:30.842
Like if I do 10 pixels here for example,
notice that it starts covering the text

108
00:07:30.842 --> 00:07:33.369
underneath there,
you don't want that so, 0.

109
00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:39.338
And then I wanted to occlude a little bit
of the border here, so I do 2 pixels.

110
00:07:39.338 --> 00:07:44.000
If I do 0 pixels here notice
the border goes now right up to it.

111
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.497
Where if I do like 10 pixels that
covers too much of the border.

112
00:07:49.497 --> 00:07:54.239
Anyway I'm trying to give you a little
bit of creative license here,

113
00:07:54.239 --> 00:07:57.359
a lot of knobs to turn it and
mess around with.

114
00:08:00.024 --> 00:08:04.794
Okay, I'm trying to think
if there's anything else in

115
00:08:04.794 --> 00:08:07.439
here that might be difficult.

116
00:08:07.439 --> 00:08:10.817
Let's take a look one more time at it.

117
00:08:10.817 --> 00:08:13.747
I did have to end up using
position to move this border, or

118
00:08:13.747 --> 00:08:16.617
this logo around a little bit
cuz it sits a little low, so

119
00:08:16.617 --> 00:08:19.443
I moved it up a little bit
using the position relative.

120
00:08:22.497 --> 00:08:26.403
If you give it a strong border radius
like a border radius of 100 pixels,

121
00:08:26.403 --> 00:08:30.869
it's such a strong border radius that will
end rounding it, which is what I did here.

122
00:08:34.252 --> 00:08:39.100
And then yeah, getting these ones
laid out correctly was difficult.

123
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:45.972
I think I ended up using grid here to get
this all the way that I wanted it to look.

124
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:51.415
And then I probably used
flex inside of that.

125
00:08:58.901 --> 00:09:00.540
Okay, so I want you to give this a shot.

126
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.747
Again, I gave you some,
this is a pretty advanced layout.

127
00:09:04.747 --> 00:09:08.974
I can actually see, I imagine most of you
could probably see this being like on

128
00:09:08.974 --> 00:09:12.953
a tablet where you're checking out
your favorite coffee shop, right?

129
00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:17.456
This is actually real designs that
I got from a real designer, right?

130
00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:21.608
It's actually from the same designer
that designed this website and

131
00:09:21.608 --> 00:09:24.268
he was doing it for something else, right?

132
00:09:24.268 --> 00:09:27.545
So this is actually a real
design that you might get.

133
00:09:27.545 --> 00:09:29.134
So it should be hard.

134
00:09:29.134 --> 00:09:32.490
Should take you a good
amount of time to do this.

135
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:37.242
And it's okay if you don't fully get
there, it's okay if you have to peek at my

136
00:09:37.242 --> 00:09:41.136
answer, I left you all the answers
here at the bottom, so yeah.
