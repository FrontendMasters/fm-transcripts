1
00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:04.132
I have a couple of recommendations for
you, for your code editor I suggest

2
00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:07.350
Visual Studio code I think we
over went over that a little bit.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.325
If you're learning to code it's just
a really beginner friendly editor.

4
00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:16.299
Even if you don't intend on using it super
long term, I'm gonna suggest you use

5
00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.530
it for this course because I will
be doing everything in VS Code, and

6
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.001
I will be showing you how to use VS Code.

7
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.346
And then later you can make
a decision to try something else.

8
00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:30.890
I'll give you some alternatives here like
Sublime WebStorm, Nova, Vim and Emacs.

9
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.837
I'm gonna suggest if you don't
already know how to use Vim and Emacs.

10
00:00:35.837 --> 00:00:37.266
Don't, do it.

11
00:00:37.266 --> 00:00:38.786
They're super hard.

12
00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:40.023
And you don't want to be
learning two things at once.

13
00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:42.080
I want you to focus on learning to code,
and

14
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.290
then later you can go learn something
really difficult like them.

15
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.594
And there's courses on front of
masters that will teach us things like

16
00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:49.273
them as well.

17
00:00:49.273 --> 00:00:53.434
For the browser, I suggest that you use
either Firefox or Google Chrome actually,

18
00:00:53.434 --> 00:00:57.310
I have Firefox up here at the moment but
both of these work really really well.

19
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.195
Both of the developer tools are really
great I would say that Google Chrome is

20
00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:04.910
probably more used in the industry
today so if you're not comfortable.

21
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.147
With either one of them it's probably
a good one to get started with but,

22
00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:11.775
honestly they're both awesome and you
should go back and forth between the two.

23
00:01:11.775 --> 00:01:15.774
Because users of your website will
be using both Chrome and Firefox and

24
00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:18.020
Safari and edge and all those various.

25
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.689
Different browsers, so it's good for
you to get familiar and

26
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.529
see your website working across
all the different web browsers.

27
00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:30.124
Well do a little bit in code
pen throughout this course,

28
00:01:30.124 --> 00:01:33.190
It's just like a little editor
that exists in the browser.

29
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.270
It's good for like examples.

30
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.494
So definitely check that out.

31
00:01:41.494 --> 00:01:44.857
And then as far as like resources,
you can go get answers for

32
00:01:44.857 --> 00:01:46.342
questions that you have.

33
00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:49.071
I'm gonna suggest MDN is
probably the best place for

34
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:53.800
like, how does these this bit of
JavaScript or how does this HTML tag work?

35
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.237
It's kind of like the industry standard.

36
00:01:57.237 --> 00:02:00.338
CSS tricks is a great
resource particularly for

37
00:02:00.338 --> 00:02:03.371
front end development
kind of technologies.

38
00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:06.742
Everything on there is really high
quality, it's vetted it's accurate.

39
00:02:06.742 --> 00:02:10.778
So I suggest that for video content
if you wanna learn future things,

40
00:02:10.778 --> 00:02:14.880
I really can't say enough good
things about front of masters.

41
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.729
And then if you're working with like
a library or framework, you probably just

42
00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.300
wanna head directly to GitHub and
get the documentation from the source.

43
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.942
So, let's kind of give you a lay of the
land of all the various different things

44
00:02:27.942 --> 00:02:29.775
that we're gonna talk about.

45
00:02:32.514 --> 00:02:37.484
So first of all, this is the intro to
web dev there is a kind of beginner

46
00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:40.157
path here on front of masters.com.

47
00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:46.129
So once you're done with my course,
there's great courses from Jen on CSS and

48
00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.667
Kyle Simpson on JavaScript
as well as Bianca.

49
00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.791
By the time that you watch this,
these might be different courses.

50
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.355
They're always shuffling in the new
ones and putting great stuff on here.

51
00:02:56.355 --> 00:03:01.428
But this is a great kind of first path
that one can take, like a beginning

52
00:03:01.428 --> 00:03:06.100
level mastery of JavaScript and
all the front end technologies.

53
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.532
So definitely suggest following that
learning path after you're done with

54
00:03:10.532 --> 00:03:11.159
this one.

55
00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.800
Today, you're gonna learn
three different languages.

56
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.460
We're gonna be learning HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

57
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.495
So let's start with what is HTML.

58
00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:23.074
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

59
00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:25.609
You can think of it like
the content on a page.

60
00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.980
So like right now you're looking at my
website that I made for you, right?

61
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.200
You can think of it as like
all of the text on here right.

62
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.361
So it's none of the style it's not
really how its laid out or anything

63
00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:42.096
like that it's not the color, it's not
the font size it's not the margins and

64
00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:44.202
paddings that exist everywhere.

65
00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:48.466
It's just the text right
it's the structure,

66
00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:54.231
it's all of the content that
you're gonna read from a website.

67
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:56.226
Think of like if we were
building a car together,

68
00:03:56.226 --> 00:03:59.010
you could think of the HTML as the raw
materials that go into the car.

69
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.620
It could be the doors, the frame,
the structure, the steering wheel, like.

70
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.245
You can just like imagine
like a neat pile, right?

71
00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:10.125
You have to like arrange all of those
things into a car for them to be work.

72
00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.461
But you still need all the components,
right?

73
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:17.673
It's the components of the car and
none of the color or the relationships or

74
00:04:17.673 --> 00:04:22.407
the engine or any of that kind of stuff,
it's just the pieces of it.

75
00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:26.448
So in order to have that style and have
that ability to move the car you're still

76
00:04:26.448 --> 00:04:28.485
gonna need the CSS and the JavaScript.

77
00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:33.804
You're gonna need the kind of
the blueprints of how it's put together

78
00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:38.685
as well as the engine, but
the content is part of the HTML there.

79
00:04:41.444 --> 00:04:44.590
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

80
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.007
You can think of it as
the style of a website.

81
00:04:47.007 --> 00:04:50.780
It's how the website looks and
feels and those kind of things.

82
00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.303
So the fact that this header is purple,
or that this background has dots in it,

83
00:04:56.303 --> 00:05:01.091
or that this has like a nice little
purple underline underneath it.

84
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:05.483
All of those little finishing
touches is all the style right?

85
00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:09.150
It's the cascading style
sheets that's the CSS right?

86
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.012
So they separate these different things so

87
00:05:12.012 --> 00:05:15.040
that you can make one type of header,
right?

88
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.553
So you can see how all these,
what is CSS, what is JavaScript.

89
00:05:18.553 --> 00:05:22.960
They all have this nice underline
underneath them, right?

90
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.026
So I can just structure all of my content
however I want, and then I make one rule.

91
00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:30.534
And then the same rule applies
to every single one of these.

92
00:05:30.534 --> 00:05:34.862
It separates my styling from my content,
which makes my styling reusable.

93
00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:38.261
And we'll get into that once
we're in the CSS section.

94
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:40.416
But I wanted to explain to you
why they separate these things,

95
00:05:40.416 --> 00:05:42.290
and why they don't just
shove everything together.

96
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.485
There's not just one language you
have to learn today, there's three.

97
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.016
So again, continuing our car analogy,
the CSS would be like where the doors go,

98
00:05:52.016 --> 00:05:56.556
what color the car is what color the
interior is, is it left or right drive?

99
00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:57.720
Like where do we put the steering wheel?

100
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.660
Those kinds of things.

101
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.501
It's how the car looks and feels.

102
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:07.910
But even still with just HTML and
CSS, our car doesn't go yet right?

103
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.058
We still need something
that makes the car go,

104
00:06:11.058 --> 00:06:14.703
we still need the sort of
interactivity with the car.

105
00:06:16.124 --> 00:06:20.262
You can think of that as the JavaScript,
you can have a total and

106
00:06:20.262 --> 00:06:23.400
complete valid website with just HTML and
CSS.

107
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.116
You really could just stop there.

108
00:06:25.116 --> 00:06:28.655
And the first thing that came to my head,
you can go to example.com,

109
00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.921
which literally is just an example domain.

110
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:35.327
There's nothing on this page other than
just like, this is an example domain,

111
00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:37.904
there's no JavaScript on this page, right?

112
00:06:37.904 --> 00:06:39.720
There's also nothing to
interact with right?

113
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.540
This website doesn't really do very much.

114
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:49.180
But you can have valid websites
with just HTML and CSS.

115
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.478
It would be useful for
something like a blog or

116
00:06:53.478 --> 00:06:57.552
just something with just inert content
that doesn't do anything, it's just you're

117
00:06:57.552 --> 00:07:00.710
gonna go you're gonna read a bunch
of stuff and then you're done.

118
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:02.419
That's a totally valid thing.

119
00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:05.404
Like you could have a car
without an engine, right?

120
00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:07.420
You would just roll it places I suppose,
right?

121
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.361
But that is technically possible.

122
00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.858
So, we don't wanna do that, right?

123
00:07:15.858 --> 00:07:17.004
We wanna have interactive websites.

124
00:07:17.004 --> 00:07:20.507
We wanna build things that you can press
a button and something happens, or

125
00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:23.796
you wanna have something like Netflix
where you can press something.

126
00:07:23.796 --> 00:07:24.990
You can go to a different page.

127
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.638
You can.

128
00:07:25.638 --> 00:07:27.841
Watch videos and things like that, for

129
00:07:27.841 --> 00:07:31.259
that kind of interactivity
you're gonna need JavaScript.

130
00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:33.985
So what is JavaScript it's
a programming language, right?

131
00:07:33.985 --> 00:07:38.698
HTML and CSS are actually not technically
programming languages in the sense that

132
00:07:38.698 --> 00:07:42.326
they don't do anything you just
say like here's the content.

133
00:07:42.326 --> 00:07:44.183
You can do like a Word DOC, right?

134
00:07:44.183 --> 00:07:47.760
A Word DOC doesn't necessarily
do anything unto itself, right?

135
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.840
But has a bunch of text.

136
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.350
Has a bunch of bolding and
font choices and colors.

137
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.770
You're gonna need something that's
gonna actually do something to that.

138
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.060
So JavaScript is the programming
language that we're going to use today.

139
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.723
There are many programming
languages like C++, Python, Go,

140
00:08:02.723 --> 00:08:04.464
all those kinds of languages.

141
00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:09.438
But we're choosing JavaScript specifically
for the purpose that your browsers,

142
00:08:09.438 --> 00:08:13.470
Firefox and Chrome and
Safari Knows how to run JavaScript.

143
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.829
It's the only language that
can run inside of a browser.

144
00:08:18.829 --> 00:08:20.631
So those other languages are great, but

145
00:08:20.631 --> 00:08:23.287
they're just not a good fit
what we're trying to do today.

146
00:08:23.287 --> 00:08:26.798
But what I will tell you is that you're
going to learn a bunch of skills today

147
00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:29.585
that if you decide later that
I really want to write Python,

148
00:08:29.585 --> 00:08:33.130
What you learned in JavaScript will
make learning Python very easy.

149
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.799
It's kind of like if you learn Spanish, it
makes learning Italian very easy because

150
00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.914
they share a lot of the same concepts.

151
00:08:39.914 --> 00:08:41.934
This is another good
analogy that I thought of.

152
00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:46.061
If you have HTML and CSS,
it's like a non-interactive website.

153
00:08:46.061 --> 00:08:48.838
It is a non-interactive website
like pages in a book, right?

154
00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:52.380
You can open a book, you can get
a lot of knowledge out of a book.

155
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.910
But, you can't like touch the book, right?

156
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.082
There's no interactivity to a book
other than just turning the pages and

157
00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:00.543
reading the content in the book.

158
00:09:00.543 --> 00:09:02.243
If you want to have some
sort of interactivity,

159
00:09:02.243 --> 00:09:04.378
you need to have something
like a tablet computer, right?

160
00:09:04.378 --> 00:09:06.543
Which makes it interactive
that you can touch things,

161
00:09:06.543 --> 00:09:07.870
things can move across the page.

162
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.034
You can have animations and
all that kind of stuff.

163
00:09:10.034 --> 00:09:13.970
That sort of going from a book to
an interactive tablet experience.

164
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.528
You can think of like,

165
00:09:15.528 --> 00:09:20.289
that's the sort of interactivity
that JavaScript can add to a page.

166
00:09:20.289 --> 00:09:22.390
So that's a relatively simplistic take.

167
00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:25.705
They're meant to be metaphors
that hopefully kind of bridge

168
00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:28.890
understanding of what JavaScript,
CSS and HTML are for.

169
00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.888
There's lots of nuance here that I'm
failing to cover with these analogies, but

170
00:09:34.888 --> 00:09:38.002
hopefully it helps you kind of
understand where we're going.

171
00:09:38.002 --> 00:09:42.150
So that's the order that we're gonna learn
things in today, we're gonna learn HTML,

172
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:45.420
then we're gonna learn CSS and
then we're gonna learn JavaScript.

173
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.276
And we're gonna build this pyramid of
knowledge that hopefully you can start

174
00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:50.590
building websites with.
