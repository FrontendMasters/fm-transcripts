00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:03.613
Let's talk about inputs.

2
00:00:03.613 --> 00:00:07.605
So sometimes you wanna accept
information from your users, right?

3
00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:12.178
So you can imagine you're filling out
some sort of shipping information, right?

4
00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:15.843
So if you're trying to ship some shoes
to yourself or something like that,

5
00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:19.988
they'll have something here of like put
in your first name, and you'll put Brian.

6
00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:24.872
That particular part where you accept user
input is called, as you might imagine,

7
00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:25.651
user input.

8
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:29.524
So these are browser inputs, it's input
that the browser provides for you.

9
00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:34.147
They'll look sometimes slightly different,
Windows ones will look a little bit

10
00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:38.846
different than Mac, cuz a lot of times
they're provided by the operating system.

11
00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:42.172
But yeah, they're very useful because
there are a bunch of these pre-built

12
00:00:42.172 --> 00:00:45.293
kind of components that allow you to
accept information from a user, and

13
00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:46.946
there's a bunch of different types.

14
00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:51.562
I always say the one that I 99% of the
time end up using is probably this input

15
00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:52.424
type= text.

16
00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:57.423
Which if you just leave out the type=
text here, it's also the default one.

17
00:00:57.423 --> 00:01:04.538
You notice that this is
the same as this one, right?

18
00:01:04.538 --> 00:01:06.234
These two are the same, right?

19
00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:10.326
But I just wanted to show you
that if you leave it off,

20
00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:13.118
it is by default a type= text type.

21
00:01:13.118 --> 00:01:15.154
And then I threw a bunch of other
ones on there just for use.

22
00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:16.824
So you can have a color selector.

23
00:01:16.824 --> 00:01:22.238
So let's say we wanna choose a nice,
I don't know, a green, okay?

24
00:01:22.238 --> 00:01:26.050
So someone could do that, right?

25
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.335
And now, they've selected a green color,

26
00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:32.485
maybe you have them choosing the color
of the t-shirt that they're creating.

27
00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:35.641
This is a file selector.

28
00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:40.367
So I can upload a file or something like
that, I can go select this file here and

29
00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.524
this will upload this file or
something like that.

30
00:01:43.524 --> 00:01:45.322
You need a server to upload it to,

31
00:01:45.322 --> 00:01:49.263
but this will allow the user to choose
which file that they wanna select.

32
00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:52.194
This is a number, right?

33
00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:57.135
So I can only enter,
only numbers will be allowed here.

34
00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:03.058
And then I can put numbers here, and
they'll have the down arrow and up arrow.

35
00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:05.727
That's a number selector.

36
00:02:05.727 --> 00:02:12.059
This one is for users, if they need
to select a time and date, all right?

37
00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:16.539
So for this one,
they wanted to do May 1, 2022.

38
00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:21.684
This will allow them to do that,
and then this will allow

39
00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:26.507
them to select a time as
like 12:30 AM on May 1.

40
00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:29.751
Radio buttons, so
if you have five options and

41
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:34.340
you wanna user to choose one of them,
you'll use radio buttons.

42
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.925
And then if you have five options and
you wanna user to select 0 to 5,

43
00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:42.089
then you'll use checkboxes, right?

44
00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.943
And that's what those are.

45
00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:50.168
So I think that's most of the types there,
there might be a couple more, but

46
00:02:50.168 --> 00:02:55.569
I don't know, I don't use the color
selector very option because typically,

47
00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:58.574
I don't need users to select colors for
me.

48
00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:01.150
But if I did, that's what that's for.

49
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.062
Okay, textareas, I think we're kind
of familiar with these as well.

50
00:03:05.062 --> 00:03:10.338
So imagine going to a comment form
on a particular page like Reddit or

51
00:03:10.338 --> 00:03:14.967
something like that and
you wanna say, This is my comment,

52
00:03:14.967 --> 00:03:19.895
but you wanna add multiple paragraphs or
something like that.

53
00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:23.664
This allows users to put in long-form
text as opposed to something like this.

54
00:03:23.664 --> 00:03:25.340
You can't hit Enter on this, right?

55
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.025
It wouldn't give you multiple lines of
textareas for longer form comments.

56
00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:36.992
And it also has this dragon, so
you can make it bigger or smaller.

57
00:03:36.992 --> 00:03:38.444
That's another text area thing.

58
00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.067
Talked about selects.

59
00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:47.028
So, similar to radio buttons here,
if you have like five options and

60
00:03:47.028 --> 00:03:49.540
you want the user to choose one of them,
you'll use this.

61
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.314
You can also use a select.

62
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:56.689
And between radio groups or radio buttons
and selects, it's just a preference.

63
00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:03.671
I would say, I typically, I see more
selects cuz they're more compact, right?

64
00:04:03.671 --> 00:04:06.840
A dropdown of,
I need to select the state that I live in.

65
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.569
Typically, you'll see those
expressed as selects.

66
00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.704
I'll say these more common, but it's up
to you if you wanna use radio buttons or

67
00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:15.063
a select, but that's what this is, right?

68
00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:16.227
So I define a select and

69
00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:19.547
then I define all the various
different options inside of them.

70
00:04:19.547 --> 00:04:24.571
So I wanna use, I'll just choose
San Francisco or Seattle or Portland.

71
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:26.682
That's what that does.

72
00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:33.038
And then a form is just a group of
inputs and text areas and selects.

73
00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:34.050
So this one, for example,

74
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.780
would be a form of housing expecting
someone to put in their name, right?

75
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.769
So Brian Holt, that little
placeholder here is basically what do

76
00:04:40.769 --> 00:04:43.679
you want the user to see if it's empty,
right?

77
00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:46.626
So it shows grayed out last name, right?

78
00:04:49.654 --> 00:04:53.652
Again, this form isn't going anywhere,
you'll have to do use JavaScript and

79
00:04:53.652 --> 00:04:55.929
your server to kind of hook up a form,
right?

80
00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:59.415
But this is actually just the part of the
HTML that will accept all the information

81
00:04:59.415 --> 00:05:00.089
from the user.
