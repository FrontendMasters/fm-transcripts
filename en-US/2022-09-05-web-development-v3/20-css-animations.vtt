00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.125
So I wanted to give you just
a little introduction to animations,

2
00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.877
cuz they're kind of fun.

3
00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:11.143
You can achieve really amazing
things with just CSS animation, so

4
00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:13.820
I just picked a random one off of CodePen.

5
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.396
But there's so much good stuff on CodePen.

6
00:00:16.396 --> 00:00:21.383
This person did the entire
solar system with

7
00:00:21.383 --> 00:00:25.979
very little JavaScript and mostly CSS.

8
00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:30.941
All these rotating planets and
stuff like that, all done with CSS.

9
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:35.952
I'm just gonna show you how to make
our little spinny-boi sick [LAUGH].

10
00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:42.175
So the thing called key frames,
you need to find a reusable animation.

11
00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:45.081
So I say here that
the spinny-boi does spin,

12
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:48.914
which refers to this named CSS
animation I created up here.

13
00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.819
This could be like lol.

14
00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:54.340
As long as I call it lol there,
just works, right?

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.608
How long it takes to go.

16
00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:03.520
So if I do 1.5 seconds,
notice it spins very slowly, or

17
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.732
10, really slow, or 0.5,
pretty fast, or 0.05,

18
00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:13.981
to the point that my browser
can't render that fast, right?

19
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:17.570
Infinite, if I just do 1, it'll stop.

20
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.866
Or if I do infinite, it will go forever.

21
00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:26.078
And then we'll get into easing, but
you could do ease where has an easing

22
00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:29.940
function, so it stops and
then goes, and that's it.

23
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.434
That's as far as using an animation.

24
00:01:32.434 --> 00:01:35.530
From here,
I just find the animation of to,

25
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.814
which I'm telling you transform
it to something like this.

26
00:01:39.814 --> 00:01:41.082
Notice I don't have a from.

27
00:01:41.082 --> 00:01:44.990
That's because the form is
implicit of where it starts.

28
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:53.687
So this would be exactly the same
as from transform: rotate(0deg).

29
00:01:53.687 --> 00:01:56.670
Let's do this linear again.

30
00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:06.612
So this doesn't make any sense because
rotate(0deg) is doing nothing, right?

31
00:02:06.612 --> 00:02:09.531
It's the same thing, which just
means that I can just leave it off,

32
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:11.493
cuz it's implicitly already that, right?

33
00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:17.100
And that's it,
that's how you do CSS animations.

34
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.888
You define the keyframes.

35
00:02:19.888 --> 00:02:27.150
You could also write this as 0% and 100%.

36
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.435
And that allows us to
do intermediary steps.

37
00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:39.393
So if I wanted to rotate
really fast to 270 degrees,

38
00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:43.478
or let's say 25 degrees, and

39
00:02:43.478 --> 00:02:48.945
I say transform: rotate(270deg).

40
00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:52.429
Notice it goes really fast to 270,
and then it slows down for

41
00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:53.759
the rest of it, right?

42
00:02:57.649 --> 00:03:00.714
So you can define all the individual
steps however you wanna define that math,

43
00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:01.560
which is kind of fun.

44
00:03:05.382 --> 00:03:09.146
That's it, you can just mess around
with that, and it's fun to play with.

45
00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:11.990
Those are called key frames,
they're reusable animations.

46
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.240
And animation is height.

47
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.285
So you define a keyframe and the way you
use a keyframe is with the animation.

48
00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:21.970
Right, that's what that
CSS property is for.

49
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.460
Okay, so easing, I just wanted to show
you really quick what easing looks like.

50
00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.266
These are all the same animation
with just different easing.

51
00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:39.663
So notice linear you have the dancer
just going straight back and

52
00:03:39.663 --> 00:03:42.132
forth with no rubber banding effect.

53
00:03:42.132 --> 00:03:46.713
So you can see here with ease,
the dancer slows down and

54
00:03:46.713 --> 00:03:50.950
speeds up, and then ease-in and ease-out.

55
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.930
It looks like ease, but
a little bit more smooth.

56
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.310
Then you can see ease-in, she looks like
she's bouncing off the right side, right?

57
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.994
Because it doesn't slow
down on the right side, but

58
00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:05.860
it will slow down on the left side,
which is the easing in.

59
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.143
Easing out's the opposite, that it looks
like she's bouncing off the left side.

60
00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:15.810
And then you got the kinda
the spastic one down at the bottom.

61
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.044
We can actually define your own function,

62
00:04:18.044 --> 00:04:22.323
which I'm not gonna really get into how
you define the function, but it allows you

63
00:04:22.323 --> 00:04:25.937
to affect the animation curve of
how fast it achieves the animation.

64
00:04:29.507 --> 00:04:30.809
So the animation looks like this.

65
00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:35.590
All it does is just translates, which it
translate's the same way of saying move.

66
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.882
So if I said translate 100 pixels, as you
might imagine, she moves further, right?

67
00:04:43.037 --> 00:04:44.713
Right, so now she's moving further away.

68
00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:52.687
And then it's all this does,
is the dancer just moves.

69
00:04:52.687 --> 00:04:56.580
And then you remember I used
the animation property?

70
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.844
Here I just broke it out into multiple
different lines, animation-name,

71
00:04:59.844 --> 00:05:02.450
animation-duration, iteration-count and
direction.

72
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.781
So these four lines would
be the same as saying this,

73
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:10.490
which is the shorthand for
multiple different properties.

74
00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:17.031
And then here, the only thing I'm
changing is the timing function.

75
00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:18.632
Linear ease, ease-in,

76
00:05:18.632 --> 00:05:23.445
ease-out, or this cubic-bezier function,
which, I left a link on there.

77
00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:26.421
I don't actually remember
what all these numbers mean.

78
00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:29.654
It's not even I don't remember,
I don't think I ever really knew,

79
00:05:29.654 --> 00:05:30.731
to be honest with you.

80
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:33.381
But it allows you to affect
the curve of how she moves.

81
00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:38.525
So read more about it here on the MDN.

82
00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:43.550
It goes into depth, including what all the
numbers of that cubic-bezier function do.

83
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.890
So you can use animation for
a lot of things.

84
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.341
I showed you position, I showed you
rotation, but I wanted to show you color,

85
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:54.980
for example, right?

86
00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.524
This is just going between various
different colors just using CSS animation.

87
00:06:00.524 --> 00:06:04.230
And all I've done here
is I've just described

88
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.901
at every different position
what I wanted the color to be.

89
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:11.781
And the reason why I chose all
of these different colors is

90
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:14.410
just that's what a rainbow looks like,
right?

91
00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.292
So just going through all the various
different colors of the rainbow.

92
00:06:18.292 --> 00:06:22.418
And so you can make it go
through all of it really fast,

93
00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:25.637
really fast, really, really fast.

94
00:06:25.637 --> 00:06:27.517
I probably don't wanna do that.

95
00:06:27.517 --> 00:06:33.702
We'll stick with slower and same thing.

96
00:06:33.702 --> 00:06:39.367
Many things can be animated with CSS,
not everything, but lots of things.

97
00:06:44.477 --> 00:06:48.023
And all you have to do is define all
the various different steps here using

98
00:06:48.023 --> 00:06:48.672
keyframes.

99
00:06:48.672 --> 00:06:50.499
And there's other ways
of doing CSS animations.

100
00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:55.193
I just wanted to show you a few,
just to kinda get your attention on it.

101
00:06:55.193 --> 00:07:01.177
Again, there's lots of great content on
Frontend Masters for animations, lots.
