WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.690
So, good news.

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.084
That's basically all of the HTML
knowledge that you're gonna need,

3
00:00:08.963 --> 00:00:11.450
To be an intermediate web developer.

4
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.590
There's more tags to learn.

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.154
There's more strategies,
there's more opinions to be had, but

6
00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:22.997
the bare bones of what you need for
HTML is mostly there.

7
00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:30.562
The last thing that I'm
gonna to show you here is,

8
00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.847
I've shown you the content part of it,
but I'm gonna

9
00:00:33.847 --> 00:00:38.459
show you the structuring part of it,
which is the head tag and the meta tag.

10
00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:42.884
So I've been showing you the visceral,
the display part of HTML, but

11
00:00:42.884 --> 00:00:46.559
there are some of it that
are like meta tags, for example,

12
00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.300
you can say what's the title
of the document, right?

13
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.490
So up here, I had this head and
meta tags right here on this tab.

14
00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.504
And I also have this nice little icon
there, those kind of tags that say, here's

15
00:00:59.504 --> 00:01:04.810
meta information about this website,
those get put here in the head tag, right?

16
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.950
It's all the information about
the document that doesn't necessarily get

17
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.495
displayed.

18
00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:15.225
So what we're gonna do is I want
you to go open your VS Code.

19
00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.963
And I'm gonna open my VS Code.

20
00:01:20.963 --> 00:01:26.940
So I have here just a brand
new instance of VS Code.

21
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.120
And I'm gonna create a new file.

22
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.528
So you can either do File &gt; New, or
you can hit Command+N or Ctrl+N.

23
00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:38.822
And then I'm gonna hit Save, so

24
00:01:38.822 --> 00:01:44.196
you can hit Command+S,
Ctrl+S or File &gt; Save As.

25
00:01:44.196 --> 00:01:48.239
And I'm just gonna go on my desktop,
you can put this wherever you want,

26
00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:49.315
make a new folder.

27
00:01:49.315 --> 00:01:53.879
And I'm gonna call this my blog, Okay?

28
00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:58.832
In my blog, I'm gonna make a new file and
I'm gonna call it index.html.

29
00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:03.200
Why index?

30
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.819
It just a convention that whatever
the root of your project is,

31
00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:08.590
we just call it index.html.

32
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.909
Doesn't have to be,
you could call it something else,

33
00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:19.242
but the main page is always
called index.html, okay?

34
00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:21.229
I'm gonna save that.

35
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:29.243
And now I have a, Root file in my project.

36
00:02:34.644 --> 00:02:37.280
This is now gonna be
the root of your project.

37
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.096
So I'm gonna help you kinda
get started with your project.

38
00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:47.053
So the very first thing in every
HTML document is you have to tell

39
00:02:47.053 --> 00:02:50.835
the browser this is the flavor
of HTML I'm giving you.

40
00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:55.636
So you do a angle bracket,
an exclamation point, and

41
00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:59.809
then you type DOCTYPE
in all capital letters.

42
00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:04.380
And then here's where you tell
what kind of document type it is.

43
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.180
You're just gonna say it's just HTML.

44
00:03:09.168 --> 00:03:13.055
This lets the browser know,
I'm getting HTML 5.

45
00:03:13.055 --> 00:03:15.495
I'm getting the latest revision of HTML.

46
00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:20.622
And there's a myriad of other types of doc
types that you never have to care about,

47
00:03:20.622 --> 00:03:23.233
100% of the time, just put this one.

48
00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:30.136
I'm also gonna show you a shortcut and
how to generate all this for you so

49
00:03:30.136 --> 00:03:31.980
you don't have to remember it,
cuz I cannot.

50
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.845
I have my notes up here with it on.

51
00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:41.150
Okay, the next thing is you're gonna put
in just this overarching HTML tag and

52
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.390
then you're gonna wanna
tell what language it's in.

53
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.078
This is useful specifically for Google,
so that Google knows that if someone's

54
00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:54.390
searching for the English version of
this document, give them this one.

55
00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.020
And this is just a two letter
representation of the language.

56
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.746
If it was Italian, you'd put it, right?

57
00:04:00.746 --> 00:04:05.459
And that way Google Italia would know to
index this one instead of the English one.

58
00:04:10.556 --> 00:04:13.644
Okay, then here we're gonna have two tags,

59
00:04:13.644 --> 00:04:17.970
one is gonna be the head tag, and
one is going to be the body tag.

60
00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:26.250
So, everything that goes
in the head tag doesn't get

61
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.550
displayed to the user directly, right?

62
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.500
So this is gonna be like,
what's the name of the document?

63
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.766
How does this handle mobile?

64
00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:37.245
What's the character set?

65
00:04:37.245 --> 00:04:39.730
The links to my CSS.

66
00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.150
Other stuff like that.

67
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.642
It's kinda like meta stuff that the
browser needs to load to make your page

68
00:04:47.642 --> 00:04:48.589
display well.

69
00:04:50.887 --> 00:04:54.690
So I try to cut this down to the bare
minimum of things that you need to get

70
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.279
started.

71
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.050
We need two meta things.

72
00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.473
One is here in the head specifically,

73
00:05:03.473 --> 00:05:07.882
meta charset="UTF-8".

74
00:05:11.896 --> 00:05:14.150
Have you ever heard
the term ASCII art before?

75
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.733
It's where they'll use letters
to make pictures, right?

76
00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:20.780
I'm trying to think of an example of that.

77
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.310
I don't have any at the moment but
you can find them online.

78
00:05:26.436 --> 00:05:32.113
A charset, so ASCII is a type of charset.

79
00:05:32.113 --> 00:05:33.880
That's the reason I say that.

80
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.228
UTF-8 is extended character set that
most of us come to rely on day to day.

81
00:05:39.228 --> 00:05:45.280
And it's basically the browser, like how
do I represent all the characters in this?

82
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.608
So if I send a letter
B down to the browser,

83
00:05:49.608 --> 00:05:53.960
how is it going to interpret that?

84
00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.672
Or how is it going to represent that?

85
00:05:55.672 --> 00:06:00.201
What's the actual zeros and
ones that it's gonna use to encode that so

86
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:02.447
that it can display it correctly?

87
00:06:02.447 --> 00:06:06.463
UTF-8 is this expanded character set
that most of us come to rely on,

88
00:06:06.463 --> 00:06:09.201
which includes emojis, for example, right?

89
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:14.746
So if I wanna put directly
in here siren emoji,

90
00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:19.450
UTF-8 has a representation of that.

91
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:27.097
Whereas if this was ASCII, like this, This
would not get encoded correctly, right?

92
00:06:27.097 --> 00:06:29.877
Because emojis are not a part of ASCII.

93
00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:36.085
In other words, I'm just explaining
this to you because someone's inevitably

94
00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:38.347
curious about why we put this here,
that's why.

95
00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:44.604
For everyone else out there that doesn't
actually care why we're putting this out,

96
00:06:44.604 --> 00:06:47.122
you just always put this and
never think about it, which is what I do.

97
00:06:50.444 --> 00:06:55.933
Okay, we're gonna put another one here and
we're gonna say name="viewport".

98
00:06:58.355 --> 00:07:03.051
With the advent of mobile browsers and
now we have not only mice that have to

99
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:07.472
interact with webpages, but
also touches, like fingers, right?

100
00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:17.010
We've had to define new ways of handling
web content for mobile users, right?

101
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:19.752
When the browser was invented,
it was invented for

102
00:07:19.752 --> 00:07:23.780
computers with wide screens and
big browsers and things like that.

103
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.070
But if you pull up in a website on
an iPhone, it's very narrow, right?

104
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.001
So we have to tell it how
to handle narrow viewports.

105
00:07:33.574 --> 00:07:39.097
So you have to say content="width =, ops,

106
00:07:39.097 --> 00:07:43.913
inside of this width=device-width,

107
00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:48.031
and initial-scale=1.0".

108
00:07:51.781 --> 00:07:53.806
This specific character line,

109
00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:59.570
if you expect people to use your website
on mobile, this becomes pretty important.

110
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.508
This is telling the browser of like, guess
what browser, I'm gonna handle all of

111
00:08:04.508 --> 00:08:08.385
my own mobile stuff myself,
do not try and handle mobile for me.

112
00:08:08.385 --> 00:08:13.297
Because otherwise, it's gonna to zoom
way out and try and fit a desktop-sized

113
00:08:13.297 --> 00:08:18.830
web page onto your users' very thin
screen and it's gonna look terrible.

114
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.057
So that's what this means.

115
00:08:24.322 --> 00:08:28.028
Basically, you can just copy and
paste these two lines into anything that

116
00:08:28.028 --> 00:08:31.873
you're starting, these will just kind
of help you get started correctly.

117
00:08:35.007 --> 00:08:37.376
Okay, last one, the title is, one,

118
00:08:37.376 --> 00:08:41.971
the title is gonna be shown in Google
if someone googles for your website,

119
00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:47.860
right, the actual name of the website
that gets shown on search page results.

120
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.707
And it's what gets shown here, right?

121
00:08:49.707 --> 00:08:53.341
The complete intro to Web Dev v3, right?

122
00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:58.520
So let's move this next to Firefox,
there we go.

123
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.887
So it's this thing that gets shown here,
like Head and Meta Tags,

124
00:09:00.887 --> 00:09:02.670
all the stuff that gets
shown there in the tab.

125
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.220
That's what is put here.

126
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.005
So I'm gonna call it My Super Cool Blog.

127
00:09:13.726 --> 00:09:18.131
Okay, and then here all your

128
00:09:18.131 --> 00:09:22.545
dope web content goes here.

129
00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:24.925
That's a comment, if you remember.

130
00:09:27.045 --> 00:09:34.678
This is like the bare bone
skeleton of a webpage.

131
00:09:38.099 --> 00:09:41.335
You're gonna put lots of other
things into your HTML, but

132
00:09:41.335 --> 00:09:43.460
this is the shell to get started with.

133
00:09:50.243 --> 00:09:53.570
Now, I don't expect any
of you to memorize this.

134
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.320
In fact, I implore you,
do not memorize this.

135
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.880
I'm gonna show you a fun little
VS Code trick to just generate this.

136
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.920
So I'm just gonna delete all this.

137
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.960
So the first thing to know is
that you have to be in HTML mode.

138
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.577
So if I look here in the bottom right,
it says HTML here,

139
00:10:11.577 --> 00:10:13.660
that's how I know I'm in the correct mode.

140
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:18.029
If it's not, you click on it,
you can find it in here, HTML, and

141
00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:20.920
just set it to HTML, like that.

142
00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.753
Now that I'm in HTML mode,
I can put html:5, and hit Tab.

143
00:10:29.226 --> 00:10:31.150
Generates that for me automatically.

144
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:41.330
Very cool, right?

145
00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:45.916
It gives you one more line here, this is
a specific thing about how to deal with

146
00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:50.432
Edge, cuz Microsoft Edge, right,
has a bunch of weird stuff about it that I

147
00:10:50.432 --> 00:10:54.696
really don't wanna get into and
I also don't remember specifically.

148
00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:57.840
You can delete the line if you want to,
you can leave it, it doesn't matter.

149
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.780
It's relatively unimportant now because
Edge has finished its migration to

150
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.390
Chromium.

151
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:05.999
That means nothing to you, doesn't matter.

152
00:11:08.747 --> 00:11:10.180
So you can go ahead and drop that.

153
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.050
And there you go.

154
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.963
That is a bare bones HTML document.

155
00:11:23.247 --> 00:11:24.580
Question so far?

156
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:25.319
Makes sense?

157
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:30.680
So if you open this page in a web browser,
in fact, let's just do it, for funsies.

158
00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:34.037
What do you expect to see?

159
00:11:34.037 --> 00:11:36.792
I put this in my desktop, right, yeah.

160
00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:44.707
So all I did is I just said Command+O or
you can hit File &gt; Open, right?

161
00:11:44.707 --> 00:11:47.051
And I'm gonna open this,
what do I expect to see in my browser?

162
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:52.159
Nothing, right?

163
00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:55.090
Except it says My Super Cool Blog up here,
right?

164
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:59.132
But that's because this is just
the bare bones skeleton of a document,

165
00:11:59.132 --> 00:12:00.890
doesn't actually have anything to show.

166
00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:05.930
And some people find that's confusing,
it's like, where did these tags go, right?

167
00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.819
The browser's reading them,
it's understanding them, and

168
00:12:10.819 --> 00:12:15.139
then it's applying them, but there's
nothing to show to a user here, right?

169
00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:17.900
So that's what's happening to it.

170
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:21.791
So again, everything that goes in
head doesn't get directly displayed,

171
00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:23.284
all that needs to go in body.

172
00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.015
Head is just meta information.

173
00:12:27.283 --> 00:12:29.206
Okay, good, feeling good?

174
00:12:32.586 --> 00:12:33.532
Okay.

175
00:12:35.682 --> 00:12:40.997
So, Let's make a anchor

176
00:12:40.997 --> 00:12:46.324
tag here a href=, and
we're gonna send it to about.html.

177
00:12:48.387 --> 00:12:51.896
And I'm gonna make an About page,
like that.

178
00:12:54.298 --> 00:12:58.906
And then I'm gonna make a new document,
so I'm gonna hit Command+N here or

179
00:12:58.906 --> 00:13:04.910
you can just hit File &gt; New,
right, New File, And then I'm

180
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:09.175
gonna save this in the same directory as
my blog, and I'm gonna call it about.html.

181
00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:15.837
Okay, I now have an about.html,
I'm gonna put HTML5,

182
00:13:15.837 --> 00:13:19.867
same thing here, and
I'm gonna say My About Page.

183
00:13:23.419 --> 00:13:29.908
Put an H1 here and say this is about me,
and then I'll put another a tag here,

184
00:13:33.463 --> 00:13:37.200
href="index.html".

185
00:13:39.598 --> 00:13:41.617
Go home or something like that, right?

186
00:13:45.212 --> 00:13:48.949
So now what I've done is I've made
two HTML documents, an index page,

187
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:51.769
a home page, if you will,
and an about page, right?

188
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.061
So if I go back over here to my page,

189
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:01.784
you can see now I have a very tiny
little About to link up there, and

190
00:14:01.784 --> 00:14:05.532
if I click on that, it takes me
to my other page, my about.html.

191
00:14:05.532 --> 00:14:08.600
If I click Go home, it takes me back,
right, back and forth.

192
00:14:11.196 --> 00:14:15.378
So that's how you just navigate
around a project, right?

193
00:14:18.252 --> 00:14:19.139
Does that makes sense?

194
00:14:27.821 --> 00:14:34.873
So, That's how you have
multiple pages in a project.

195
00:14:38.032 --> 00:14:44.436
So just open folder here, There we go.

196
00:14:44.436 --> 00:14:46.403
So now I can see both my files in here.

197
00:14:54.685 --> 00:15:00.339
And if yours is not showing that,
if you click here on the file explorer,

198
00:15:00.339 --> 00:15:06.662
you can just say File &gt; Open Folder and
just navigate to Blog here and click Open.

199
00:15:06.662 --> 00:15:10.316
This will open your Blog
folder in your VS Code.
