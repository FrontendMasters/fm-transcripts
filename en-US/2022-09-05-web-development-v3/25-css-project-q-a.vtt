00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.033
Any questions on my
implementation of how it is?

2
00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.948
Anything I do that didn't make sense?

3
00:00:08.348 --> 00:00:09.059
Yeah, sure.

4
00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.087
&gt;&gt; I noticed that you use a lot of div,
and that's probably okay but

5
00:00:14.087 --> 00:00:18.695
I was thinking I did
paragraphs in a lot of mine.

6
00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:23.323
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so-
&gt;&gt; Cuz I normally think of div as

7
00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.485
containers.

8
00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:28.389
&gt;&gt; It's a super valid question and
a valid point.

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.800
So for example, let's see if I can find
one more I just kind of yellowed it.

10
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.170
Like here, this div right here,
where it's just containing text.

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.020
There's a super valid reason that you
would say this is a paragraph, right?

12
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.430
Cuz it's just text.

13
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.070
So I'll give you two sides of that.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.032
I typically use divs if I'm actually
putting an actual paragraph of

15
00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:52.943
text, right?

16
00:00:52.943 --> 00:00:56.110
Cuz actually they are going
to be sentences to read.

17
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.791
That's a personal choice and
it's not correct, it's not incorrect.

18
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:05.550
I do wanna broaden your
definition of what divs can be.

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.719
They can be containers,
they certainly are containers,

20
00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.140
that part of the definition
absolutely correct.

21
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.910
But they're just amorphous.

22
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.247
They are whatever you define them to be.

23
00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:17.481
So in this particular case,
I define them to be item quantity.

24
00:01:17.481 --> 00:01:21.810
It's more defined what the class
is rather than what the div is.

25
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.831
IIt's a blob and you can shape it
into whatever you want it to be.

26
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:29.144
But personal preference at that point.

27
00:01:29.144 --> 00:01:32.050
If you feel like paragraphs are more
fitting there, I'm super okay with that.

28
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.486
I'm happy that you're forming opinions
about it or have opinions about it.

29
00:01:36.486 --> 00:01:37.583
How do we do?

30
00:01:37.583 --> 00:01:40.720
Okay?
Did we feel okay about this?

31
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.260
Was it hard?

32
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.379
This probably took me at
least an hour to do and

33
00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:47.530
I've done this thing
a trillion times my career.

34
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.430
So I did not knock this out very quickly.

35
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.770
So if it took you a while to do it,
you're okay.

36
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.558
I don't know if I'm gonna
call myself good company, but

37
00:01:58.558 --> 00:02:00.138
you're at least in my company.

38
00:02:03.507 --> 00:02:04.247
Okay.

39
00:02:07.618 --> 00:02:10.430
Cool.

40
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:18.055
So one thing I think I'm not
positive I mentioned in previously,

41
00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:22.919
but the way you link a stylesheet in here.

42
00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.458
We don't wanna do it in here,
we wanna look at the other one.

43
00:02:24.458 --> 00:02:26.473
And here.

44
00:02:29.961 --> 00:02:35.310
So here in the head, I just have this
link here, out to style sheet, right?

45
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.573
This is how you link to
external style sheets.

46
00:02:40.496 --> 00:02:42.450
Same thing with an href and
all that kinda stuff.

47
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:44.430
Yeah, Mark.

48
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.290
&gt;&gt; You used the nav for the logo?

49
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.690
Wouldn't it be more meaningful
to use the header tag instead?

50
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.670
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that's actually a really good point.

51
00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.890
So astutely calling out
that I call this a nav.

52
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.610
Just nothing really navigating about this.

53
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.369
Better semantic tag for
this would be header.

54
00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:14.954
Because that's more accurately what it is.

55
00:03:20.692 --> 00:03:24.749
That is somewhat better,
a somewhat more important

56
00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:29.265
distinction just because
a screen reader is gonna look for

57
00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:34.010
a navigation bar to define where
it can send its user next..

58
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.689
There's nowhere to navigate in here.

59
00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:42.580
It's more accurately just a header,
that's at the top of the page.

60
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.076
So yeah, good call

61
00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:54.638
Cool.

62
00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:01.660
So we are done with HTML and CSS.

63
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.577
Hopefully feel pretty good about those.

64
00:04:06.577 --> 00:04:11.416
You can get jobs doing just HTML and
CSS, there's a lot of people that

65
00:04:11.416 --> 00:04:15.428
have WordPress sites that
just need styling and design.

66
00:04:15.428 --> 00:04:19.617
Beyond that actually know a decent
amount of designers these

67
00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:24.393
days that they don't even work in figma or
things like that anymore.

68
00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:27.393
They do all of their designs
directly into the HTML and CSS,

69
00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:30.094
they don't end up writing
very much JavaScript, but

70
00:04:30.094 --> 00:04:33.910
they end up doing their designing
process directly in HTML and CSS.

71
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.285
So for designers this is actually super
useful we've gone through so far.

72
00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:43.655
Not every lots of people still
use stigma by the way, or

73
00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:46.133
sketch or anything like that.

74
00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:48.794
But yeah, I think it's pretty cool.
