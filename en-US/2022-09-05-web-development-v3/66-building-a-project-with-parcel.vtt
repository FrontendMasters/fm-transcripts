1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.124
So this is cool, I think it's cool, but
we could make this a bit better, I think.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.512
There's a problem here with our code,
looking at our code here in index.html.

3
00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:18.040
Here we're relying on
unpackage to never go down or

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.540
to not move something or
to delete something.

5
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.449
Basically, we've entrusted the health
of our website to a third party which

6
00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.270
is not a good thing, right?

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.337
Actually know the person
who works on a package, but

8
00:00:32.337 --> 00:00:34.494
you probably don't know the person
that works on package, right?

9
00:00:34.494 --> 00:00:39.267
How much do you trust them you probably
had never heard of them until right now,

10
00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:40.728
so maybe not very much.

11
00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:46.832
So, I'm gonna show you how to build
your own projects very quickly.

12
00:00:46.832 --> 00:00:50.605
So instead of including this,
we'll just include file.

13
00:00:53.173 --> 00:01:01.390
So, I'm gonna need you now,
actually coming back here, to go to here.

14
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.957
If you have not installed node,
we're not actually going to use node,

15
00:01:04.957 --> 00:01:07.340
but we're gonna use node
to build our project.

16
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.579
This link here will
take you to nodejs.org,

17
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.253
you can download a version of Java's or
of Nodejs.

18
00:01:14.253 --> 00:01:19.134
I'm gonna be on node 16 as long as you're
above like node 12, probably okay,

19
00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:20.991
like 14, 16 will be good.

20
00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:31.113
Okay, that might take you a little
bit some of you probably already have

21
00:01:31.113 --> 00:01:31.884
installed.

22
00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:36.536
If you're watching the video just pause
me, go install it and then come back.

23
00:01:39.129 --> 00:01:42.405
And then we're gonna do a little bit
here just a tiny bit of stuff in

24
00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:43.366
the command line.

25
00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:46.398
I have a whole course in front of masters
that I would suggest taking after this.

26
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:49.961
If you're not familiar at the command
line, we'll actually go in depth and

27
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:51.425
teach you it.

28
00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:55.155
It's called the complete intro
to Linux and the command line.

29
00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:56.336
It'll teach you all these kinds of things.

30
00:01:56.336 --> 00:01:59.053
We're just gonna do like the most
bare bones little bit of it.

31
00:02:01.247 --> 00:02:06.223
So once you have node installed, I want

32
00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:10.210
you to open your project
here in the command line.

33
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.477
I think with Mac, you can literally
just drag it on there, let me try.

34
00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.820
There we go, so mine's on desktop/motion.

35
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.074
Yours might not look like this, so I'll
make this much bigger so you can see it,

36
00:02:25.074 --> 00:02:29.280
but all the command line is it's little
client that lets you navigate around.

37
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.297
If you're on Windows, you'll have to use
something like PowerShell, probably.

38
00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:39.688
Which will work fairly similarly, and

39
00:02:39.688 --> 00:02:43.242
then Mac you can just open
the terminal application here.

40
00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:51.655
Okay, so I'm on motion, And,

41
00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:57.330
We're just gonna make this
as simple as possible.

42
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.286
I'm gonna say npm, which stands for

43
00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:07.038
node package manager,
install --global parcel.

44
00:03:07.038 --> 00:03:10.431
Parcel is the name of the tool they'll
actually build our project for us.

45
00:03:19.321 --> 00:03:24.538
Try doing that, you'll see something

46
00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:28.339
that should look like this.

47
00:03:39.516 --> 00:03:43.550
Should take a little bit probably, okay,
so now I have a tool called parcel.

48
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.334
And I'm just gonna say parcel which is
now a tool that I've installed, and

49
00:03:49.334 --> 00:03:53.441
I'm just gonna say index.html,
which is the name of the file that you and

50
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:54.915
I were building, right?

51
00:03:57.265 --> 00:04:00.650
Okay, now this is building a project for
us.

52
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.982
So notice I say it's running at localhost
: 1234, so you can just copy that.

53
00:04:07.982 --> 00:04:12.433
And come over to your browser and
just paste that in there.

54
00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:16.391
So you can see I have the same website but
instead of notice here,

55
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:18.840
same website I have file, right?

56
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.277
This is actually running from a little
tiny server hosted inside of my computer.

57
00:04:23.277 --> 00:04:27.506
So, as opposed to having like a server
hosted out in Amazon or Digital Ocean, or

58
00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:30.996
something like that,
my server is hosted inside of my computer.

59
00:04:30.996 --> 00:04:35.284
So my computer is both the client and
the servers, local development, right?

60
00:04:37.246 --> 00:04:42.449
Cool, Now instead of saying here

61
00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.244
in animation.js,
just add one more line at the top here,

62
00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:53.347
say const: popmotion=require(popmotion).

63
00:04:53.347 --> 00:04:56.613
So, you're gonna come in and
you're gonna delete this script, and

64
00:04:56.613 --> 00:05:00.288
the other thing you have to come in you
have to tell parcel kind of code this is.

65
00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:03.837
And it's gonna be modular codes,
have to say type=module.

66
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:09.943
Okay, you're gonna be getting
an error over here says, hey,

67
00:05:09.943 --> 00:05:14.177
I don't know what popmotion is,
we have to go install it.

68
00:05:14.177 --> 00:05:21.360
So, the next thing you're gonna do is you
can say, Ctrl+C, it will stop your server.

69
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.403
So this will stop my server and
back to my thing here.

70
00:05:25.403 --> 00:05:30.986
And I'm gonna say npm install popmotion,
and let's keep it to version 11,

71
00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:36.410
so just a pop motion@11, cuz that's
what we were using before, right?

72
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.203
As of the filming of this, that's the most
current version of popmotion, but

73
00:05:41.203 --> 00:05:44.623
if you watch this, a year from now
they might have have 12 or 13 out,

74
00:05:44.623 --> 00:05:46.180
which might work differently.

75
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.046
Okay, now I'm gonna say
parcel index.html here again.

76
00:05:57.826 --> 00:06:04.192
And if I refresh my page here,
now this still works,

77
00:06:04.192 --> 00:06:09.414
right, but where is the code coming from?

78
00:06:09.414 --> 00:06:11.477
Where is popmotion?

79
00:06:14.157 --> 00:06:19.590
Well, if you look here, when you said npm
install, you created this thing called

80
00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.724
node modules, and inside of here,
you can see that you have a few libraries.

81
00:06:24.724 --> 00:06:27.700
Most importantly,
popmotion is coming from here.

82
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:32.064
So, when you say here in your code
require popmotion, this is going and

83
00:06:32.064 --> 00:06:36.162
grabbing popmotion out of your node
modules so that you can use it.

84
00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:41.900
You now have a superpower that you
can go get any open source library.

85
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.399
All you have to say is npm install,
react, right.

86
00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:48.744
And all of sudden react is available for
you to use and

87
00:06:48.744 --> 00:06:51.634
all of your code, or
popmotion or momentJS or

88
00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:56.212
the entire myriad of things that
JavaScript developers have created.

89
00:06:56.212 --> 00:06:59.682
This is kind of unlocking your next
step for you that you can go and

90
00:06:59.682 --> 00:07:02.591
create new projects with frameworks and
libraries.

91
00:07:10.752 --> 00:07:12.292
Any questions about this?

92
00:07:16.494 --> 00:07:19.344
You'll notice this did create
a bunch of stuff for you.

93
00:07:19.344 --> 00:07:22.901
It creates a package.json,
it creates a package lock,

94
00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:27.048
it creates a node modules, and
then parcel creates parcel cash and

95
00:07:27.048 --> 00:07:31.580
a bunch of other stuff for you,
that's all fine that's very expected.

96
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:36.541
And then the last thing I
wanted to show you here,

97
00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:40.050
if we look here now in our console,

98
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:45.150
we wanna look in the network,
that refresh here.

99
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.014
Notice, I have this like index.64,
thing I got,

100
00:07:48.014 --> 00:07:52.358
this is actually the built Javascript
that's being sent down to your computer.

101
00:07:52.358 --> 00:07:57.534
And if I look at the response here,
This is all of your code.

102
00:07:57.534 --> 00:08:02.710
Notice how much code is here, right, it's
absolutely wild how much code is here.

103
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.581
This is all of your code.

104
00:08:04.581 --> 00:08:09.200
Most of this is just popmotion cuz
popmotions are fairly large library, but

105
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.606
your code I think is probably
right there at the bottom.

106
00:08:12.606 --> 00:08:14.101
It's gonna be pretty close to the bottom.

107
00:08:15.913 --> 00:08:20.243
Well, maybe it's in here somewhere,
anyway, your code is somewhere in here,

108
00:08:20.243 --> 00:08:23.186
right, but
it's enough that this is all able to work.

109
00:08:26.164 --> 00:08:29.580
Cool, that's all I wanna
show you about that.

110
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.741
I just wanted you to be unblocked,
if you wanted to go and

111
00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:34.571
install something like react.

112
00:08:37.402 --> 00:08:40.525
If you're interested in stuff like that,

113
00:08:40.525 --> 00:08:46.251
there's tons of front of masters
courses on React, Angular, View, Ember,

114
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:52.173
all sorts of other really fun stuff, and
basically all of them use this process.

115
00:08:55.869 --> 00:09:04.763
Okay, So,

116
00:09:04.763 --> 00:09:09.439
yeah, I actually list some of
these down here at the bottom.

117
00:09:09.439 --> 00:09:12.772
Complete intro to React, so you wanna
get started with you wanna React.

118
00:09:12.772 --> 00:09:16.084
There's View by Sarah,
there's Angular with Lucas.

119
00:09:16.084 --> 00:09:20.685
And then if you wanna do something like
data visualization, there's currently one

120
00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:24.983
out by surely, but there's one coming
out next week by Angela, okay, cool.

121
00:09:24.983 --> 00:09:29.207
Yeah, so check out that one by Angela
cuz I'm sure by the time this one's

122
00:09:29.207 --> 00:09:31.020
out that one will be released.
