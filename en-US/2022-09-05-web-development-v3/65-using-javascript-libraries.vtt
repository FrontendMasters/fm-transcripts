WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.715
So that is all the intro to web
development stuff in terms of HTML, CSS,

2
00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:08.250
JavaScript that I wanted to
go over with you today, so

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.230
all that stuff is behind you.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.630
Again, you now literally coded Wordle,

5
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.915
a project that sold for
millions of dollars, okay?

6
00:00:17.915 --> 00:00:22.682
So I wanted to just give you a couple
of other next step kind of things.

7
00:00:22.682 --> 00:00:28.355
One of them is definitely the Frontend
Masters Learning Path for Beginners.

8
00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:31.030
It's specifically laid out for
people that are trying to get started.

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.277
And then beyond that, there's
several other great learning paths.

10
00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:37.717
If you wanna go down React, or Vue,
or some of those other frameworks,

11
00:00:37.717 --> 00:00:42.089
all that stuff has great learning
paths already in Frontend Masters.

12
00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.360
Specifically, what I wanna show you is
how do you integrate other people's code?

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.315
Right now, you and

14
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:49.551
I have been writing code that we
all wrote personally together.

15
00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:54.807
But one of the beauties of modern coding
is that people share a lot of code, right?

16
00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:59.471
So, I wanna show you how to use
just someone else's third party

17
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:00.972
code really quick.

18
00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:04.872
So we're gonna use
something called Popmotion.

19
00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:08.559
It's doing animations, but in JavaScript.

20
00:01:08.559 --> 00:01:13.539
So what I want you to do is I
want you to make another folder,

21
00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.518
maybe on your desktop or
something like that.

22
00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:20.774
And we'll call this motion or
something like that, and

23
00:01:20.774 --> 00:01:22.793
we're gonna open this in VS Code.

24
00:01:22.793 --> 00:01:26.663
We're gonna make a file,
we're gonna call it index.html.

25
00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:33.302
We can actually probably just
make this full screen here so

26
00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:35.000
it's easier to use, okay?

27
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.872
In here, we're gonna say html:5 and
this will be called JS Animations.

28
00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:46.797
So I picked JS Animations.

29
00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:50.736
This is more to exemplify not how
to do animations in JavaScript,

30
00:01:50.736 --> 00:01:54.616
it's more to exemplify how to
integrate someone else's code.

31
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.976
Let's see, bring up my notes here.

32
00:02:10.422 --> 00:02:15.031
Okay, we're going to make
a link here to some style

33
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:19.758
that we're about to write,
so style.css, okay?

34
00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:24.312
We'll make a new file here and
we'll call it style.css.

35
00:02:24.312 --> 00:02:28.216
And here I want you to
put a little bit of CSS.

36
00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:32.250
You can copy directly from my notes
if you want to, it's just this piece.

37
00:02:37.222 --> 00:02:40.462
Okay, we're making a ball.

38
00:02:40.462 --> 00:02:44.163
By giving it a border radius of 50%,
it's gonna be round, right?

39
00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:48.799
Background color, and then we're
putting it in the middle of the body.

40
00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.612
And that's basically it, okay?

41
00:02:52.612 --> 00:02:57.702
So if we open this file, which I have

42
00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:02.463
on my desktop, motion &gt; index.

43
00:03:10.247 --> 00:03:11.926
What did I do here that's wrong?

44
00:03:15.222 --> 00:03:19.080
And I need to go put that into my HTML.

45
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:25.005
So you can put here an h1,
have it called Animation,

46
00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:28.824
and then we're gonna have a div and

47
00:03:28.824 --> 00:03:32.921
its class is going to be called ball.

48
00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:38.759
Okay, now if you refresh the page,

49
00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:44.345
you should see some h1 on here
called Animation and our blue ball.

50
00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:46.665
And we're gonna make this ball move.

51
00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:54.597
So first thing I want you to do,
we're gonna put a script tag here,

52
00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:58.067
and we're going to include
someone else's code.

53
00:03:59.737 --> 00:04:01.605
So I can just say source.

54
00:04:01.605 --> 00:04:05.885
Normally, I've been saying something
like .script or something like that.

55
00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:10.645
But we're actually putting external URL,

56
00:04:10.645 --> 00:04:13.608
https://unpkg.com.

57
00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:19.195
You can by the way just totally
copy this directly from the notes,

58
00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:21.640
I would not be upset by that.

59
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:30.363
/popmotion@11.0.3/dist/popmotion.global.m-

60
00:04:30.363 --> 00:04:38.452
in.js.

61
00:04:42.746 --> 00:04:45.051
So what is this?

62
00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:48.217
This is including a library
that's exist out on the Internet.

63
00:04:48.217 --> 00:04:53.315
Unpkg is a website that just hosts
external libraries, so you can pull React

64
00:04:53.315 --> 00:04:58.824
off of here, you can pull Angular, all
that stuff can come directly off of Unpkg.

65
00:04:58.824 --> 00:05:06.350
It's partmotion.min.js, I had put
.global in there, delete the .global.

66
00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:11.750
Which, again,
here I have this global part right there.

67
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.299
Just delete that.

68
00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:17.550
So it's just popmotion.min.js.

69
00:05:19.595 --> 00:05:21.911
Okay, now, here in my code,

70
00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:26.640
I have globally available this
new thing called popmotion,

71
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.659
which obviously is that's not
built into the browser, right?

72
00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.398
That's something else that
someone else wrote, in fact,

73
00:05:35.398 --> 00:05:37.506
there's a whole website for it.

74
00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:42.570
Popmotion.io, this will show
you this very cool website that

75
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.589
this person built of all the various
different cool things you can do with it.

76
00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:51.097
It's a very powerful library that does
really advanced sorts of animation there.

77
00:05:51.097 --> 00:05:53.948
We were doing things like
making things spin and

78
00:05:53.948 --> 00:05:56.237
making things move from side to side.

79
00:05:56.237 --> 00:05:58.442
This will help you do things like physics,
right?

80
00:05:58.442 --> 00:06:01.466
It's actually very powerful
from that perspective.

81
00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:08.008
So, now we have this built into our page.

82
00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:10.938
Let's go do something with it.

83
00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:14.940
So let's come back over
here to our script.

84
00:06:18.181 --> 00:06:21.831
It's very important,
underneath line 14, not above,

85
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:26.358
we're gonna put another script, and
you just call it animation.js, or

86
00:06:26.358 --> 00:06:31.702
something like that, or script.js, doesn't
matter, whatever you wanna call it.

87
00:06:31.702 --> 00:06:36.295
And then make another file,
call it animation.js.

88
00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:44.354
I wanna say const ball =
document.querySelector('.ball').

89
00:06:46.106 --> 00:06:51.686
And then we're just gonna use popmotion,

90
00:06:51.686 --> 00:06:54.789
popmotion.animate.

91
00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.369
And then we're just gonna
give it a bunch of stuff.

92
00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:01.267
We're gonna say from 0
pixels to 100 pixels,

93
00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:06.754
500 pixels,
whatever you feel like putting there.

94
00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:11.732
repeat: Infinity,
Infinity is actually a special term

95
00:07:11.732 --> 00:07:16.616
in JavaScript that literally
means infinity, right?

96
00:07:16.616 --> 00:07:18.652
So by telling it to repeat infinity,

97
00:07:18.652 --> 00:07:21.884
it's obviously going to repeat
infinite amount of time.

98
00:07:21.884 --> 00:07:26.969
You can put 100 if you want it to
only go 100 times, so on, so forth.

99
00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:31.846
repeatType is going to be mirror, which
means it's gonna go one way and then come

100
00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:36.307
back, as opposed to going one way and
then starting over and coming back.

101
00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:42.297
Wanna give it a type of spring,

102
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:49.086
Which is gonna be like the easing
function on it, right?

103
00:07:49.086 --> 00:07:51.633
Where it's gonna kinda spring a little
bit and then move to the side.

104
00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:55.828
And there's a bunch of things that this
is already built into this particular

105
00:07:55.828 --> 00:07:59.973
library, we're just taking advantage
of some of them that already exist.

106
00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:07.891
We're gonna say onUpdate,
What the update is.

107
00:08:07.891 --> 00:08:13.953
We're gonna say ball.style.left = update.

108
00:08:13.953 --> 00:08:17.573
Now you might be asking me,
what is all of this?

109
00:08:17.573 --> 00:08:20.374
I don't necessarily understand
everything that's going on.

110
00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:23.581
Again, more of the point of this
lesson is not how to use Popmotion,

111
00:08:23.581 --> 00:08:26.917
it's a animation library, there's
a ton of stuff you can go do on it.

112
00:08:26.917 --> 00:08:31.238
I'm trying to show you that by
including this script tag here first,

113
00:08:31.238 --> 00:08:33.335
I'm then able to access it here.

114
00:08:36.512 --> 00:08:37.634
These are a bunch of options.

115
00:08:37.634 --> 00:08:41.202
If you go look into Popmotions
documentation, it'll actually lay out very

116
00:08:41.202 --> 00:08:44.449
succinctly, this is how you do all
these various different things.

117
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:48.060
The onUpdate function basically is
the part that actually goes and

118
00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.035
updates the DOM.

119
00:08:49.035 --> 00:08:51.363
Let's see what the update is.

120
00:08:56.404 --> 00:08:59.648
Why is this getElementsbyClassName,
it should be style.

121
00:08:59.648 --> 00:09:01.562
Is that really what that was?

122
00:09:01.562 --> 00:09:03.071
No, it wasn't, okay?

123
00:09:03.071 --> 00:09:04.118
So this is correct, right?

124
00:09:04.118 --> 00:09:08.037
You can see this is going back and
forth, that's what I expect.

125
00:09:13.652 --> 00:09:15.963
Now, if I inspect this,
okay, this is good, right?

126
00:09:15.963 --> 00:09:20.733
Now this is going back and
forth, the way that I expect.

127
00:09:20.733 --> 00:09:26.787
Now I think I just have something that's
just not respecting position relative.

128
00:09:29.141 --> 00:09:35.264
So I think I have to go in here to the
style.css, we have to say this is body.

129
00:09:37.724 --> 00:09:40.248
This needs to be position relative.

130
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:45.184
Now if I refresh the page,
there we go, okay.

131
00:09:48.977 --> 00:09:52.148
Now we get this nice kinda
springy action going here.

132
00:09:52.148 --> 00:09:56.676
Yeah, I don't think you
could do this with CSS.

133
00:09:56.676 --> 00:10:01.428
It'd be tough to get that kind of physics
kind of bounce a little bit that it

134
00:10:01.428 --> 00:10:02.894
has from side to side.

135
00:10:02.894 --> 00:10:05.456
I'm not gonna say it's not possible,
I'm sure someone could prove me wrong.

136
00:10:05.456 --> 00:10:06.211
You could, actually.

137
00:10:06.211 --> 00:10:09.464
With keyframes, you could get
really specific with keyframes and

138
00:10:09.464 --> 00:10:10.402
make that happen.

139
00:10:10.402 --> 00:10:14.229
But as you can see here with Popmotion,
it makes it extremely easy.

140
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:20.711
And again, this is going from side to
side, you can now start messing with this.

141
00:10:20.711 --> 00:10:26.648
This could go 250, and instead of
going left, you could have it go top.

142
00:10:26.648 --> 00:10:29.150
And now it's gonna go up and
down and go further.

143
00:10:32.187 --> 00:10:33.581
All sorts of really cool stuff.

144
00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:40.657
So, one, we learned Popmotion, kind of
fun, really fun to mess with, right?

145
00:10:40.657 --> 00:10:43.375
Two, we learned,
in order to include something,

146
00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:46.742
all you have to do is go find
the library that you wanna include.

147
00:10:46.742 --> 00:10:49.597
Make sure you include it before your
script, right, because if I include it

148
00:10:49.597 --> 00:10:52.376
afterwards, it's not gonna work
because it's not available, right?

149
00:10:52.376 --> 00:10:55.889
Cuz these scripts execute in
the order that you put them there.

150
00:10:55.889 --> 00:10:58.744
And yeah.

151
00:11:02.485 --> 00:11:10.946
And we also have, Yeah, very cool stuff.

152
00:11:10.946 --> 00:11:12.626
And so you can go in here to,

153
00:11:12.626 --> 00:11:16.806
what's the name of the function
that we're using here, animate?

154
00:11:22.256 --> 00:11:25.575
Let's look at repeat or type, right?

155
00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:28.956
Here I have spring, let's try decay.

156
00:11:28.956 --> 00:11:32.341
I don't know what that actually does,
but we'll try it.

157
00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:35.399
So what I did here is I came
to the popmotion.io website,

158
00:11:35.399 --> 00:11:38.154
I looked at the options,
and there's a type here.

159
00:11:38.154 --> 00:11:41.900
Right now we have it as spring because
spring seemed like a fun thing to do.

160
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.580
But there's another one here called decay,
and I actually don't know what that does.

161
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.963
So if we come back over here and say
animation, change from spring to decay.

162
00:11:55.198 --> 00:11:56.791
Let's see what ends up happening here.

163
00:12:02.584 --> 00:12:03.711
Not working the way I expected.

164
00:12:03.711 --> 00:12:06.391
Well, I don't know what I was expecting,
right, but

165
00:12:06.391 --> 00:12:08.678
it doesn't do anything
that I was hoping for.

166
00:12:08.678 --> 00:12:11.361
So instead if we go back to spring,
there we go,

167
00:12:11.361 --> 00:12:14.190
now it's actually working
the way that I expect.

168
00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.990
So I have to go dig into
the documentation to figure out what I

169
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.676
was actually supposed to do there.
