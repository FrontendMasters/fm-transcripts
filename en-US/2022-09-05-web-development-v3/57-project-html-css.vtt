1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:07.321
I hope you had some Wordle of a time,
making your Word Master.

2
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:11.370
You and I we are gonna code this
together kinda piece by piece.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.281
I'm gonna spend most of
the time on the JavaScript,

4
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:18.198
I feel like you're well equipped at
this point to do that HTML and CSS.

5
00:00:18.198 --> 00:00:22.639
So I'm basically just gonna copy and
paste that from my correct code,

6
00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:26.040
but we'll go through
the JavaScript piece by piece.

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.638
So, I'm just gonna create a new
file folder on my desktop.

8
00:00:31.638 --> 00:00:35.291
This will be, WordMasters,

9
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:39.781
and we're gonna put
word-masters into VS Code.

10
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:47.554
Okay, I need three files here,
I need a index.html,

11
00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:52.258
And we'll put a nice little
shell in here for that.

12
00:00:52.258 --> 00:00:57.750
This will be called, Wordy Masters,

13
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.731
I've decided now that it's Wordy Masters.

14
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:06.747
We'll have a style.css, and
we'll have a, I don't know,

15
00:01:06.747 --> 00:01:10.807
what do you wanna call it,
wordy-masters.js.

16
00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:19.918
Here in the index.html,
I do a link CSS this.

17
00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:23.147
So it'll actually generate
that correctly automatically.

18
00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:26.341
If you wanna see what I did,
it's called Emmet.

19
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:30.019
It's built into VS code.

20
00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:34.049
I can just start typing if it's a valid
HTML document and say link, and

21
00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.570
then I just chose CSS right here, and
it just generates the correct tag for me.

22
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.966
It's kinda nice.

23
00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:44.070
Same thing here with scripts,
you just go script source here, and

24
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.225
this is just gonna go to, you can actually
even to have lets say, wordy-masters.

25
00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:51.930
Help you choose the correct one.

26
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.353
Okay, we have a nice kind of,
A script tag there.

27
00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:00.773
Nice little skeleton going.

28
00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:10.215
So, let's just go ahead and
go grab this from the solution,

29
00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:13.980
cuz I think this is gonna be not
the most interesting part of this.

30
00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:21.589
Copy this, And

31
00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:27.642
I gotta make sure this is gonna be to
style.css, and this is going to be to,

32
00:02:27.642 --> 00:02:32.271
I called it wordy-masters cuz
I have decided to change.

33
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:35.796
Okay, so let's just talk through
what I did with my HTML.

34
00:02:35.796 --> 00:02:40.422
All of the head looks familiar to you.

35
00:02:40.422 --> 00:02:45.100
You might be wondering why put ./,
or don't put ./,

36
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.937
they mean exactly the same thing.

37
00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:53.660
So you can either put in the ./
which just means, in this directory,

38
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.489
I want style.css, or you can put
styles.css that both works as well.

39
00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.129
I have a header here called
the navbar with the brand on it.

40
00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.596
I have my loading spinner here.

41
00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:13.118
And what I'm gonna do while I'm coding
this, is I'm just going to add something

42
00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:15.839
called hidden,
which is a class that I'm going to make.

43
00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:20.877
Which is going to set its visibility to
be invisible, and then when I remove it

44
00:03:20.877 --> 00:03:25.772
it'll be showing it, so it just makes
it easy to make it show up and go away.

45
00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:29.953
And then I have here,
I called it the scoreboard.

46
00:03:29.953 --> 00:03:32.967
In retrospect,
I don't know why I called it a scoreboard,

47
00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:35.033
just could have called letters though.

48
00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:38.487
And then I just have 29, or
actually I have 30 spaces, right?

49
00:03:38.487 --> 00:03:44.935
Cuz I have six guesses,
and I have five per row.

50
00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:48.825
Now, you could just as equally,
you saw what I did in my calculator,

51
00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:50.718
I put them into division of rows.

52
00:03:50.718 --> 00:03:53.573
This time it made sense to me,
it does well,

53
00:03:53.573 --> 00:03:58.748
these are all going to be exactly the same
size, and I can use this to my advantage

54
00:03:58.748 --> 00:04:03.408
to be able to get the correct ones, so
I put them all just in the same div.

55
00:04:06.522 --> 00:04:07.059
Okay, and

56
00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.775
they're all empty cuz none of them have
any guesses in them at the moment.

57
00:04:10.775 --> 00:04:13.682
And then that's it,
that is all of my HTML.

58
00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:17.588
So that's good.

59
00:04:17.588 --> 00:04:22.788
Let's go grab the style.css here.

60
00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:27.074
And again, I'm gonna just copy and
paste this one as well.

61
00:04:27.074 --> 00:04:32.570
We'll walk through it but then we'll
hand code off the JavaScript together

62
00:04:36.707 --> 00:04:40.552
Okay, box sizing,
we're pretty familiar with that.

63
00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:45.528
You might have seen this,
this is just a really common way

64
00:04:45.528 --> 00:04:49.997
of using built-in fonts
to the operating system.

65
00:04:49.997 --> 00:04:53.653
So when we did open Sans for
the previous project,

66
00:04:53.653 --> 00:04:58.193
your browser has to go out,
talk to Google, download a font.

67
00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:02.581
That's not free, it's not exactly super
expensive for someone to do that.

68
00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:07.426
And when I say expensive,
meaning it doesn't take a long time, but

69
00:05:07.426 --> 00:05:09.469
it takes some time, right?

70
00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:17.512
If you do this, everything is
built in to a user's browser.

71
00:05:17.512 --> 00:05:19.309
So I end up doing this one a lot.

72
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:21.698
This is probably the font
that I end up using the most.

73
00:05:21.698 --> 00:05:26.847
Apple's system, it just says,
use the font that macOS has built into it,

74
00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:32.098
which I believe is currently called
San Francisco, is the name of the font.

75
00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:38.522
BlinkMacSystemFont, so if this is in
Chrome, it's saying, use San Francisco.

76
00:05:38.522 --> 00:05:43.448
Then if the user has a one in
built into a called Segoe,

77
00:05:43.448 --> 00:05:46.637
which is Windows' default font.

78
00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:52.281
Then Roboto, then Oxygen, then Ubuntu,
these two I think are from Linux.

79
00:05:52.281 --> 00:05:55.591
I believe Roboto is built
into most operating systems.

80
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:57.104
So it's just going through like a list.

81
00:05:57.104 --> 00:05:58.497
It's, do you have this font?

82
00:05:58.497 --> 00:05:59.373
Do you have this font?

83
00:05:59.373 --> 00:06:00.275
Do you have this font?

84
00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:04.555
Eventually it'll eventually
land on Sans-Serif,

85
00:06:04.555 --> 00:06:09.687
which is, look, just give me
a font that doesn't have serifs,

86
00:06:09.687 --> 00:06:12.840
which is the little accents at the end.

87
00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.315
You can see Open Sans is here, right?

88
00:06:15.315 --> 00:06:19.465
Helvetica Neue,
that's another one that's fairly common.

89
00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:22.569
But that's how font family is,
just check if they have this one.

90
00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.158
If they don't, try this one,
then try this one, then try this one.

91
00:06:27.158 --> 00:06:34.405
Almost everyone will have,
Down here to Ubuntu.

92
00:06:34.405 --> 00:06:36.778
99% of your users will have one of these.

93
00:06:39.114 --> 00:06:40.674
Okay, that's all.

94
00:06:40.674 --> 00:06:43.726
You don't have to use this one either,
you could have made it.

95
00:06:43.726 --> 00:06:46.263
I know you could just use Helvetica Neue,
that's a really good font,

96
00:06:46.263 --> 00:06:48.420
you could use that one directly,
there's a bunch of them.

97
00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:57.606
Okay, I used this for

98
00:06:57.606 --> 00:07:01.311
the scoreboard,
I used grid template columns.

99
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:05.577
And I just said, look, there's gonna
be five things in each one of these and

100
00:07:05.577 --> 00:07:08.991
just spaced them equally, and
you end up with this, right?

101
00:07:08.991 --> 00:07:11.929
One, two, three, four, five, right?

102
00:07:15.386 --> 00:07:19.298
So just to drive that home,
if I come in here and I edit this to be,

103
00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:25.030
1fr one more, right, it'll add one more.

104
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:31.035
Or if I do this it'll be four to a line,
But we want five to a line,

105
00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:36.977
so, That is the power of grid.

106
00:07:41.895 --> 00:07:49.212
Okay, I make everything uppercase,
that's fine.

107
00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:52.899
Here's a correct class, the background
is dark green and the color's white.

108
00:07:52.899 --> 00:07:56.278
If they're close,
then I add a class called close.

109
00:07:56.278 --> 00:08:01.676
I chose golden rod, that seems like
a nice shade of yellow, a little dark.

110
00:08:01.676 --> 00:08:04.805
And then wrong,
I made a kind of a light gray.

111
00:08:07.991 --> 00:08:11.512
And then invalid,

112
00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:17.239
it does this flash animation.

113
00:08:17.239 --> 00:08:22.069
So it goes from 0 to 5%, it goes from
whatever color it was to crimson, so

114
00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:24.307
that's like a quick flash to red.

115
00:08:24.307 --> 00:08:29.714
And then it spends the rest of time
flashing back to gray which is CCC.

116
00:08:29.714 --> 00:08:36.085
So you get this nice flashing effect
whenever you add a invalid class.

117
00:08:36.085 --> 00:08:40.824
And then this is the loading spinner,
Which is

118
00:08:40.824 --> 00:08:45.777
using literally the exact one that I
showed you in the css animations section.

119
00:08:45.777 --> 00:08:50.561
Hidden, so let's talk about hidden for
a second, going back over here.

120
00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:54.577
So notice this has the hidden here and
it has visibility hidden.

121
00:08:54.577 --> 00:08:57.986
What's the difference between
display none and visibility hidden?

122
00:08:59.815 --> 00:09:04.175
Visibility hidden, it still takes
up space even if you can't see it.

123
00:09:04.175 --> 00:09:07.818
If it's display none it
totally removes everything.

124
00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:08.922
Let me show you what I'm talking about.

125
00:09:08.922 --> 00:09:12.775
So right now if I unhide this you'll
see the spinning thing, right,

126
00:09:12.775 --> 00:09:14.176
the loading indicator?

127
00:09:14.176 --> 00:09:16.888
But notice it's not moving, right?

128
00:09:16.888 --> 00:09:20.275
So it's still taking up the space in
the DOM, it's pushing everything down,

129
00:09:20.275 --> 00:09:21.569
which is what I want, right?

130
00:09:21.569 --> 00:09:24.475
I don't want it to jank up and down.

131
00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:27.772
So if I do display none,

132
00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:36.152
Let's do this rather this way,
display none.

133
00:09:36.152 --> 00:09:41.363
Notices it jumps up and, I'll just
get rid of the the visibility here.

134
00:09:41.363 --> 00:09:46.328
Okay, notice it jumps up and down, Right,

135
00:09:46.328 --> 00:09:50.696
cuz when I say display none it
stops taking up space in the DOM.

136
00:09:50.696 --> 00:09:56.722
Whereas with visibility hidden,
It just makes it invisible but

137
00:09:56.722 --> 00:09:58.653
it still takes up space.

138
00:09:58.653 --> 00:10:00.363
Does that makes sense?

139
00:10:00.363 --> 00:10:04.791
So, nice little trick there to nicely
show something and then hide it later.

140
00:10:08.865 --> 00:10:13.111
And for the swirl here,
I literally just used an emoji, right?

141
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:15.813
There's a spiral emoji here that I used.

142
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.750
You could have totally made this, I don't
know, a dog or something like that.

143
00:10:24.992 --> 00:10:26.139
Whitespace, what are you doing?

144
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:29.993
I would like dog, please.

145
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:34.978
There we go.

146
00:10:34.978 --> 00:10:38.895
So you can have a dog loading
spinner instead of a spiral.

147
00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:40.797
It's literally just making
whatever's in that div spin.

148
00:10:43.528 --> 00:10:44.331
Okay, and

149
00:10:44.331 --> 00:10:50.144
then down here this is the same rainbow
animation that we used before as well.

150
00:10:50.144 --> 00:10:56.152
And I called this winner, so
if I inspect elements on this,

151
00:10:56.152 --> 00:11:00.959
and I add additional
class here called winner,

152
00:11:00.959 --> 00:11:04.580
now notice that it is rainbow type.

153
00:11:06.128 --> 00:11:11.832
So you'll find you do this a lot with
JavaScript and CSS and things like that.

154
00:11:11.832 --> 00:11:15.559
Rather than directly manipulating
the styles, I just add a class, right, or

155
00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:16.755
I'll take away a class.

156
00:11:16.755 --> 00:11:20.382
That way all of my styles
still stay in my CSS, right?

157
00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:24.627
But they're kind of conditionally applied
by whether it has the class or not.

158
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:32.637
Okay, that is all of

159
00:11:32.637 --> 00:11:37.252
my, HTML and CSS.

160
00:11:37.252 --> 00:11:41.186
Let's just open this now.

161
00:11:41.186 --> 00:11:44.395
We're on the desktop and
I made wordy-masters.

162
00:11:48.315 --> 00:11:49.440
There you go.

163
00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.187
And by default,
this is what it looks like.

164
00:11:52.187 --> 00:11:56.117
Notice by default, I don't hide the
spiral, that's because whenever someone

165
00:11:56.117 --> 00:11:59.781
loads the page for the first time,
it still needs to grab the word, right?

166
00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:02.995
It needs to load the page and then it
needs to hit the API to grab the word.

167
00:12:02.995 --> 00:12:07.325
So by default the user is loaded
into a loading state, right?

168
00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:09.311
So that's why I don't
hide that right away.

169
00:12:14.301 --> 00:12:18.855
Okay, So,

170
00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:23.877
let's go ahead and
start writing some code.

171
00:12:26.781 --> 00:12:29.307
We're in wordy-masters.js.

172
00:12:29.307 --> 00:12:30.308
&gt;&gt; There is a quick question.

173
00:12:30.308 --> 00:12:33.148
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

174
00:12:33.148 --> 00:12:38.382
&gt;&gt; When I write HTML, and after that I
write CSS, then I write JavaScript and

175
00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:41.844
I switch between those,
there's some delay and

176
00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:46.338
making my mindset, right, for
what I'm using the language.

177
00:12:46.338 --> 00:12:51.302
Do you have any tips to avoid that, or

178
00:12:51.302 --> 00:12:56.438
just avoid the delay in your mindset?

179
00:12:56.438 --> 00:12:57.014
&gt;&gt; Totally.

180
00:12:57.014 --> 00:12:58.142
&gt;&gt; Writing each language.

181
00:12:58.142 --> 00:13:00.038
&gt;&gt; It's a good question.

182
00:13:00.038 --> 00:13:03.986
I mean,
basically it's context switching, right?

183
00:13:03.986 --> 00:13:08.748
You have all this stuff in your brain and
then you're thinking in terms of raw HTML

184
00:13:08.748 --> 00:13:11.284
and then you have to
context switch to CSS.

185
00:13:11.284 --> 00:13:15.409
And kinda have throw away the context
in HTML and regain context in CSS,

186
00:13:15.409 --> 00:13:17.215
that is inefficient, right?

187
00:13:17.215 --> 00:13:20.097
Where there's some inefficiency and
loss in your context switching.

188
00:13:20.097 --> 00:13:23.937
It's the same principle of, you
are working on something and maybe you're

189
00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:28.139
working on homework and then someone says,
hey, can you help me for five minutes?

190
00:13:28.139 --> 00:13:29.828
So you go do something and come back, and

191
00:13:29.828 --> 00:13:32.025
you've lost your entire train of thought,
right?

192
00:13:32.025 --> 00:13:33.294
Same principle here.

193
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:43.199
It's tough cuz some of
it is just necessary.

194
00:13:43.199 --> 00:13:46.099
One thing that you can do,
rather than just try and

195
00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:49.897
holistically write all of the HTML
at once and all the CSS at once,

196
00:13:49.897 --> 00:13:52.959
you can rather tackle it
in terms of small problems.

197
00:13:52.959 --> 00:13:56.711
So maybe you start by just
writing the header first, right?

198
00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.997
Where is I'm just gonna work on this part
and you do all of the HTML and CSS for

199
00:14:00.997 --> 00:14:05.900
that small piece at a time, and then that
way you're always thinking about headers,

200
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.402
right?

201
00:14:06.402 --> 00:14:10.969
And HTML and CSS at the same time
you're taking a smaller problem and

202
00:14:10.969 --> 00:14:13.064
you're just working on that.

203
00:14:13.064 --> 00:14:21.111
That can certainly help, I don't know,
otherwise some of it's just necessary.

204
00:14:21.111 --> 00:14:24.064
But it's gonna come down to
your personal preference.

205
00:14:24.064 --> 00:14:28.953
The way that I code in the way that works
for me is not gonna be the same way.

206
00:14:28.953 --> 00:14:31.605
So, there was a while that my
wife learned how to code and

207
00:14:31.605 --> 00:14:33.534
it was really interesting to watch her.

208
00:14:33.534 --> 00:14:37.273
She would very heavily go into the CSS
first before thinking about any of

209
00:14:37.273 --> 00:14:38.215
the JavaScript.

210
00:14:38.215 --> 00:14:41.932
And I'm immediately thinking about
the JavaScript as soon as they hop into

211
00:14:41.932 --> 00:14:42.527
anything.

212
00:14:42.527 --> 00:14:46.883
So, just like some people
are visual versus audio learners,

213
00:14:46.883 --> 00:14:50.988
I think people have different
styles of writing code, and

214
00:14:50.988 --> 00:14:55.539
you kinda just have to experiment
with various different ways.

215
00:14:55.539 --> 00:14:59.662
Some just kind of high level
advice is if you watch me code and

216
00:14:59.662 --> 00:15:04.539
what I'm doing is really working for
you, just copy what I'm doing.

217
00:15:04.539 --> 00:15:08.556
Just steal my workflow and
work on it and then you'll find, well,

218
00:15:08.556 --> 00:15:12.597
Brian does this but I don't like this,
so I'm gonna change this.

219
00:15:12.597 --> 00:15:17.101
And you kind of steal my way and then you
just modify it until it works for you.

220
00:15:17.101 --> 00:15:20.636
And then you should watch a bunch
of courses, cuz for example,

221
00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:23.518
Sarah Drasner codes a very
different way than I do.

222
00:15:23.518 --> 00:15:27.640
And mine is not any better or hers is not
any better, they're just different, but

223
00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.777
you might like the way that Sarah
does things better than I do.

224
00:15:30.777 --> 00:15:34.360
So you might check out some of her
courses to gain some of that context.
