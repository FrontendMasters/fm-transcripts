1
00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:04.504
The cascade is gonna cause you so
many, just heartaches and

2
00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:07.582
problems and
all sorts of things like that.

3
00:00:07.582 --> 00:00:10.390
And it can be really useful sometimes, and

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.359
it can be a big old pain
in the butt sometimes.

5
00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:20.476
Something that I've been doing and
I haven't really been talking about,

6
00:00:20.476 --> 00:00:24.027
most of the time, you don't wanna
style directly in a style tag.

7
00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:27.592
I'm just showing that to you here so
that you can see the HTML and

8
00:00:27.592 --> 00:00:30.091
the CSS literally right
next to each other.

9
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.755
Typically, you wanna do it like we saw it
in CodePen, where there's separate files.

10
00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:37.171
You have style.css and index.HTML, and

11
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:41.715
your HTML file will link
to the style sheet.

12
00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:44.588
You technically can't put style
tags directly in there and

13
00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:48.279
then put little bits of CSS in there,
don't do that, almost never do that.

14
00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:52.456
It's useful for this particular exercise
so that you can see these right next

15
00:00:52.456 --> 00:00:56.840
to each other, but that's just for
learning, don't do that in your projects.

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.258
Okay, when we get to the project, I'll
really help you see that more concretely.

17
00:01:03.258 --> 00:01:06.525
Okay, So

18
00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:10.986
let's talk about the cascade.

19
00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:15.882
What happens when you have two rules that
conflict with each other, which one wins?

20
00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:20.286
It depends.

21
00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:25.482
So this is called the cascade,
that's why it's cascading style sheets.

22
00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:31.090
It defines a bunch of rules, of like
if two things conflict, which one wins?

23
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.173
So if you were just looking at this,
I have one h1 here, and

24
00:01:36.173 --> 00:01:41.055
I have two rules that have
the same selector, .title and

25
00:01:41.055 --> 00:01:45.853
.title, what color would you
expect cool title to be?

26
00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:47.512
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking the red.

27
00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:49.966
&gt;&gt; First one, Rustin.

28
00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:53.166
&gt;&gt; It's a super valid intuition to have,
it's the other way though.

29
00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.808
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; The one.

30
00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:57.827
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But I can totally see where you're

31
00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:02.611
coming from, it's the last one to find,
the lowest down one on whatever you are.

32
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:08.758
So if you load five style sheets, right,
cuz you can load multiple CSS files,

33
00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:12.869
it'll be the last one that wins,
so green, right?

34
00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:17.359
If they have the same specificity, that's
a term that you'll hear thrown around.

35
00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.833
If they're the same specificity, it'll
just be the last one that defines it wins.

36
00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:27.025
So, Even if it's like this,

37
00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:30.775
right, where both of them
are the same thing, right,

38
00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:35.437
they're both classes, right,
it'll just go with the lower one.

39
00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:42.935
And by all means, if I copy and
paste that one underneath here,

40
00:02:42.935 --> 00:02:44.867
notice that now it's red.

41
00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:46.933
So it's just the lowest one on the page.

42
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:52.878
So, I think that makes sense,
if they're the same specificity,

43
00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:55.287
the lower one makes sense or
is the one that wins.

44
00:02:59.785 --> 00:03:02.219
Maybe even to just drive it
home a little bit further.

45
00:03:10.138 --> 00:03:12.848
Right, so now there's three of them
that are all the same specificity.

46
00:03:12.848 --> 00:03:17.438
It doesn't matter, Okay?

47
00:03:17.438 --> 00:03:21.042
Now, let's look at this one.

48
00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:25.109
Look, I literally taught you that in the
next thing, so even if they're different,

49
00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.003
it doesn't matter,
it's still the last one wins, right?

50
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:29.790
So green one here.

51
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.314
One thing to note though is it's not like
it's on a property by property basis,

52
00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:35.899
right?

53
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.866
So notice main-brand-2 here
has something else, and

54
00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:41.041
it's not overwritten in the second one.

55
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:44.528
This is gonna apply, right,
because nothing overrode it.

56
00:03:44.528 --> 00:03:48.521
So it does have this black border here
that I got from that first class, right?

57
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:52.619
So it's gonna merge these things together,
rather than having one winning rule,

58
00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:54.268
which is a useful thing, right?

59
00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:58.566
Imagine if I had a light theme and
a dark theme for everything, right?

60
00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:01.683
If it has the dark theme button,
only override parts of the colors and

61
00:04:01.683 --> 00:04:04.855
everything like that, but the border,
the size, the positioning,

62
00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:07.690
all that stuff stays the same,
we don't need to override it.

63
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.317
So just by adding that little bit, we
can kind of bring it along for the ride.

64
00:04:12.317 --> 00:04:13.979
Does that make sense?

65
00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.081
All right, so
now imagine that we have this, title and

66
00:04:22.081 --> 00:04:26.741
main-brand, we just have two classes,
right?

67
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:34.214
This one has .main-brand-3.title.3,
so it has two classes together,

68
00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:39.355
right, and
I have title-3 here with just one class.

69
00:04:39.355 --> 00:04:41.693
Which one is more specific?

70
00:04:43.876 --> 00:04:48.480
It's the first one,
cuz it has two classes, right?

71
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:55.863
So this is gonna end up being red
because this is more specific, Right?

72
00:04:55.863 --> 00:04:59.578
And you can literally just count how
many class names there are, right?

73
00:04:59.578 --> 00:05:00.980
You can even repeat it, right?

74
00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.880
So if I actually come in here and
say, .title-3 again, right,

75
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.445
I just repeated the same class,
CSS doesn't care, right?

76
00:05:08.445 --> 00:05:11.333
Now, they're both two specificity,
right, so

77
00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:13.756
whatever the one is last on the page wins.

78
00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:23.401
But if it only has one,

79
00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:30.364
This is more specific,
the selector is more specific.

80
00:05:31.988 --> 00:05:35.488
And what if I had a p here?

81
00:05:35.488 --> 00:05:42.814
The class = title-3, some text.

82
00:05:45.404 --> 00:05:48.259
Some text is green.

83
00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.331
I feel like I'm choosing the worst colors,
if you're colorblind,

84
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:55.573
I'm very sorry about that,
that is not intentional.

85
00:05:55.573 --> 00:06:00.951
This one ends up being blue, right,
because it doesn't match this one,

86
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:05.915
right, cuz it doesn't have this
main-brand-3 class, right?

87
00:06:05.915 --> 00:06:11.794
It just has title-3, so
it ends up being blue.

88
00:06:11.794 --> 00:06:15.181
So keep in mind,
all of the selectors have to match.

89
00:06:18.763 --> 00:06:22.441
Does that makes sense?

90
00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:30.094
Okay, how about this one?

91
00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:34.308
I'm trying to set you up to fail here,
I'm doing that on purpose,

92
00:06:34.308 --> 00:06:36.812
I'm trying to subvert expectations.

93
00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:45.712
You have an h1, and you say,
all h1s will be colored green, right?

94
00:06:45.712 --> 00:06:50.616
And you have a title-4 class here,
which is another h1, so

95
00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:53.836
which one is more specific in this case?

96
00:06:53.836 --> 00:06:54.727
&gt;&gt; Title four.

97
00:06:54.727 --> 00:07:01.491
&gt;&gt; Title four, because classes
are more specific than tags.

98
00:07:06.327 --> 00:07:12.337
An imperfect way of thinking about it is
thinking about the classes is in the tens

99
00:07:12.337 --> 00:07:18.272
place and the tags are in the zero place,
right, or the one's place, right?

100
00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:24.540
So, if I have five tag selectors, which
is actually technically not possible,

101
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:30.637
but don't think about that too much for
a second, or I have one class, right?

102
00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:32.957
Obviously, the 10 is bigger than the 5.

103
00:07:32.957 --> 00:07:37.895
Now, it's imperfect because even if you

104
00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:42.833
have 254 tag selectors and one class,

105
00:07:42.833 --> 00:07:46.937
the class is still more specific.

106
00:07:46.937 --> 00:07:50.022
Basically, if you have a class selector,

107
00:07:50.022 --> 00:07:53.549
it's always more specific
than a tag selector.

108
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:02.615
So classes are always more specific
than tags, that's the takeaway there.

109
00:08:02.615 --> 00:08:06.897
So the class selector will overpower
a tag selector, it's more specific.

110
00:08:10.194 --> 00:08:12.475
This is why I'm telling you to
do everything in classes so

111
00:08:12.475 --> 00:08:15.707
that it's more obvious how the cascade's
gonna happen, because once you start

112
00:08:15.707 --> 00:08:19.102
getting into niche use cases, it becomes
really strange of which one's gonna win.

113
00:08:23.237 --> 00:08:26.308
So, here's a fun one for

114
00:08:26.308 --> 00:08:30.996
you, what color is this h1 gonna be?

115
00:08:30.996 --> 00:08:38.542
It's gonna be orange, It has two classes,

116
00:08:38.542 --> 00:08:45.249
so you can think of that being 20,
right, in my shorthand.

117
00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:49.625
This has a tag and a class,
so it'd be 11, and

118
00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:53.133
this has one class, so it'd be 10.

119
00:08:56.157 --> 00:08:57.499
So that's why this is orange.

120
00:08:57.499 --> 00:09:02.411
If I delete this one,
which one do you think it's gonna be?

121
00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:06.670
&gt;&gt; Red.

122
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.662
&gt;&gt; Red, right,
cuz it's a little bit more specific,

123
00:09:09.662 --> 00:09:12.179
cuz it has the tag
selector in there as well.

124
00:09:16.782 --> 00:09:18.202
Cool, good job.

125
00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:26.386
This is almost all of
the CSS I want you to do,

126
00:09:26.386 --> 00:09:30.926
is selecting very rarely,
sometimes by tag.

127
00:09:30.926 --> 00:09:34.242
And again, in that specific case, where
you want literally all of them on your

128
00:09:34.242 --> 00:09:37.173
website style that way, and
then all the rest of time doing classes.

129
00:09:37.173 --> 00:09:41.409
And for the most part, if you can
stick to one class, that's ideal.

130
00:09:41.409 --> 00:09:44.903
Sometimes a second kind of utility,
sometimes maybe a third utility.

131
00:09:44.903 --> 00:09:49.905
If you're going beyond three classes,
you're getting a little too crazy for

132
00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:54.144
my taste, and I think you should
kinda tone it down to one to three,

133
00:09:54.144 --> 00:09:58.489
preferably one, because it keeps
your CSS very straightforward.

134
00:09:58.489 --> 00:10:02.809
If you start relying on the cascade for
lots of stuff,

135
00:10:02.809 --> 00:10:07.618
down the road, your CSS is gonna
end up being just bonkers.

136
00:10:07.618 --> 00:10:10.943
And let me tell you specifically,
having worked at LinkedIn,

137
00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:14.531
which had a two megabyte style sheet,
which is enormous by the way.

138
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.167
Most stylesheet should be what?

139
00:10:18.573 --> 00:10:24.277
20 kilobytes,
I feel like that's a big stylesheet.

140
00:10:24.277 --> 00:10:25.794
What is it on this website?

141
00:10:25.794 --> 00:10:29.219
And now I'm afraid to look, but let's
just go look at how big my stylesheet is.

142
00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:35.126
I'm there, CSS.

143
00:10:39.222 --> 00:10:46.422
25, okay, and I'm including some other
stuff in there that's less important.

144
00:10:46.422 --> 00:10:50.016
So this entire website is 25 kilobytes.

145
00:10:50.016 --> 00:10:53.804
LinkedIn's was two megabytes,
which is absolutely bonkers, right?

146
00:10:53.804 --> 00:10:56.028
It caused the site to be super slow,

147
00:10:56.028 --> 00:11:00.773
we had a hard time deleting anything
because we delete one piece of the CSS and

148
00:11:00.773 --> 00:11:04.276
it would cause weird cascades
into the rest of our code.

149
00:11:04.276 --> 00:11:08.728
Keeping very simple and straightforward
CSS is difficult and requires discipline,

150
00:11:08.728 --> 00:11:12.271
right, cuz you can see there's
a ton of flexibility in the system.

151
00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:16.519
And so if you abuse it,
it's going to abuse you later.

152
00:11:18.106 --> 00:11:21.924
So that's my advice,
keep your selectors simple,

153
00:11:21.924 --> 00:11:25.059
rely on the cascade as little as possible.

154
00:11:25.059 --> 00:11:29.456
Sometimes you end up just having to copy
and paste some of your styles sometimes,

155
00:11:29.456 --> 00:11:31.405
that ends up being okay sometimes.

156
00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:37.266
Okay, why do I say all of
this to you right now?

157
00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:41.575
I'm about to show you, I've shown
you how to use hammer and nails,

158
00:11:41.575 --> 00:11:46.563
I'm gonna show you how to use wrecking
balls with CSS that I hope you never use,

159
00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:48.240
but you need to know them.
