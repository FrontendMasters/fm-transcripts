1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.379
So just like we have the basic
building block of what

2
00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.814
HTML is which is the tag right?

3
00:00:06.814 --> 00:00:12.628
Place to that word 50 times
in the past bit of the class.

4
00:00:12.628 --> 00:00:18.957
The basic building blocks
of CSS is the rule.

5
00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:21.565
So a rule looks like this.

6
00:00:21.565 --> 00:00:26.294
It's got this is called the selector,
the H1 here.

7
00:00:26.294 --> 00:00:30.480
And then inside of it, you're gonna have a
bunch of properties that you're gonna set.

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.680
But this entire thing you
would call a rule in CSS.

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.821
Let's explain that in just a second.

10
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.880
So we're gonna define a bunch
of rules which are gonna define

11
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.764
the style of our particular website.

12
00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:50.414
So again, cascading style sheets.

13
00:00:50.414 --> 00:00:54.060
Not a programming language per say in the
sense that it's just declaring that if you

14
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.478
have this, it looks like this.

15
00:00:55.478 --> 00:00:58.931
That's the entire thing of what CSS does.

16
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:03.176
You're just giving the browsers hey,
if you recognize this pattern,

17
00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:05.026
then apply these styles to it.

18
00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:05.925
That's it.

19
00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:09.116
If you match this selector,
apply these styles.

20
00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:15.911
That's the entire extent of CSS, it is
really no more complicated than that.

21
00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:20.805
So if I wanted a rule that
said all h1's on my webpage

22
00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:24.929
will be colored red, you would write this.

23
00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.205
That's what this rule says it says.

24
00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:31.691
All h1 which is what the selector
says will be colored red.

25
00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:35.927
So again,

26
00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:40.262
this is like we were talking about our car
analogy where it's touching to tell you

27
00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:44.168
how it looks and how are arranged in
some of those other things like that.

28
00:01:44.168 --> 00:01:46.218
But it doesn't change the content, right?

29
00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:49.321
So I'm not saying that all
h1's will have the text blur.

30
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.120
You don't do that with CSS.

31
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.619
You do, all h1's will look like this.

32
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.886
So that's what this would do.

33
00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.803
It would make all h1's.

34
00:02:02.803 --> 00:02:10.317
So this is an h1 be colored red like this.

35
00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:15.790
So again selecting this the h1 is
called the selector this part here.

36
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.933
You're basically saying you're
giving the browser of look for

37
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.806
anything that matches this pattern.

38
00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:24.136
And that can be a lot more
complicated than just h1 but

39
00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:26.356
I'm showing you a very simple one.

40
00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:28.729
But it's gonna match your HTML, right?

41
00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:35.392
CSS does nothing by itself,
it needs HTML, it's paired to HTML.

42
00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:39.812
Whereas like you and I just did a section
on HTML we technically didn't need any CSS

43
00:02:39.812 --> 00:02:41.488
for the HTML to be functional.

44
00:02:41.488 --> 00:02:46.321
A style sheet by itself
does nothing it needs

45
00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:52.081
something to attach to any
HTML to attach to, okay?

46
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:57.737
This part here,
the color colon is called the property.

47
00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:02.910
And there's Some 350 properties.

48
00:03:06.815 --> 00:03:13.102
If you look at this, these are all
the things that you can set in CSS.

49
00:03:13.102 --> 00:03:18.636
Most of them you'll
never even think about.

50
00:03:18.636 --> 00:03:21.181
Page break before,
I don't even know what that does.

51
00:03:21.181 --> 00:03:25.106
I never even heard of it until literally
right now as I'm teaching the class on CSS

52
00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:28.581
to you, someone's gonna say like but
Brian it does this I don't know.

53
00:03:28.581 --> 00:03:30.547
Haven't had to use it before,

54
00:03:30.547 --> 00:03:33.883
which is to say I Google
things a lot when I need them.

55
00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:35.037
And that's totally okay.

56
00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:36.904
It's very expected.

57
00:03:36.904 --> 00:03:38.351
So anyway, the properties.

58
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:40.894
There's 350 of them.

59
00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:43.194
You'll never use most of them.

60
00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:46.526
Same kind of thing where we had
that zip distribution of them.

61
00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:48.869
You use some of them a lot color.

62
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:50.010
You can use color a lot.

63
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.278
As you might imagine we call it
a things different things a lot.

64
00:03:53.278 --> 00:03:56.014
Page break before, almost never.

65
00:03:56.014 --> 00:03:57.376
Cuz again, I don't know what it is.

66
00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:59.781
Maybe you're very different than me,
but probably not.

67
00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:07.026
So maybe, yeah, 50 to 100 or extremely
useful and there's a long tail after that.

68
00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:14.104
So color property affects
the color of the font, right?

69
00:04:14.104 --> 00:04:15.316
So this is red.

70
00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:18.680
It actually affects more than that.

71
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.196
But we almost never use it for
anything besides that.

72
00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:23.911
So, in other words,
just mostly use it for font color.

73
00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:31.097
And then this here is the value.

74
00:04:31.097 --> 00:04:33.048
So this value can be any number of things.

75
00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:35.976
It can be a named color.

76
00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:39.232
It can be a hex color.

77
00:04:39.232 --> 00:04:43.447
So let's just inspect this and
mess around with it and see what happens.

78
00:04:43.447 --> 00:04:48.102
We're gonna make this go to the side,
top the right.

79
00:04:48.102 --> 00:04:53.117
Make this bigger, get rid of that.

80
00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:58.115
Okay, so you can see here I
have this color red here.

81
00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:00.122
We can make that blue, right?

82
00:05:00.122 --> 00:05:02.700
We can make this.

83
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.224
There's so many.

84
00:05:03.224 --> 00:05:05.836
Look how many colors are.

85
00:05:05.836 --> 00:05:07.561
Some of them are really funny.

86
00:05:07.561 --> 00:05:12.502
I think my favorite is peru.

87
00:05:12.502 --> 00:05:16.912
If you didn't know that's
the color of peru.

88
00:05:16.912 --> 00:05:18.573
Why is it the color of peru?

89
00:05:18.573 --> 00:05:21.081
I don't know, but that's what it is.

90
00:05:21.081 --> 00:05:23.819
But most things that you would expect,
I don't know.

91
00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:24.727
I think there's a lavender.

92
00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:28.775
If you wanna make lavender blush,

93
00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:32.831
that's a nice color difference.

94
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:35.030
Medium orchid.

95
00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.446
I don't know.
That's that's a medium orchid, right?

96
00:05:36.446 --> 00:05:38.276
So there's a bunch from.

97
00:05:38.276 --> 00:05:41.066
Those are called, named colors.

98
00:05:41.066 --> 00:05:45.988
But also technically if I put 555 that

99
00:05:45.988 --> 00:05:50.052
will be a shade of black, right?

100
00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:54.383
So there's hexadecimal colors,
you don't have to really care about that.

101
00:05:54.383 --> 00:05:58.879
But there's a variety of ways
that we can denote color.

102
00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:00.062
I'm gonna stick with red though.

103
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.896
So red there is the value.

104
00:06:07.896 --> 00:06:11.096
You can see that there's
named colors as 150 of those.

105
00:06:11.096 --> 00:06:12.701
Understands hex values.

106
00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:20.803
Which is FF000 which would be to red.

107
00:06:20.803 --> 00:06:25.158
Yeah, so FF this here would represent red.

108
00:06:25.158 --> 00:06:28.445
It's actually the same color as red,
this red.

109
00:06:28.445 --> 00:06:30.502
RGB which red, green blue.

110
00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:33.934
So 255 it goes from zero to 255.

111
00:06:33.934 --> 00:06:35.524
You don't really have to care
too much about any of this.

112
00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:39.232
I'm just kind of giving you examples here.

113
00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:44.771
This would be red and then HSL which
if you are a color design nerd,

114
00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:50.946
HSL which is Hue Saturation Lightness,
I think is what that stands for.

115
00:06:50.946 --> 00:06:52.968
This would also be red as well.

116
00:06:52.968 --> 00:06:55.025
I understand HSL far less but

117
00:06:55.025 --> 00:07:00.697
it's also very useful if you're trying
to do color modifications on the fly.

118
00:07:00.697 --> 00:07:04.455
Yeah, so all those things evaluate
to the same color as red.

119
00:07:04.455 --> 00:07:07.756
You don't have to really know how all
these work, I'm just kind of trying to

120
00:07:07.756 --> 00:07:10.397
demonstrate to you that the value
can change contextually.

121
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.182
If you're super interested into how
all of that works, there's a great

122
00:07:17.182 --> 00:07:21.879
article on how colors work on CSS tricks,
and I left a link there for you.

123
00:07:27.153 --> 00:07:31.995
Okay, and then last thing to note here,
semicolon, very important.

124
00:07:31.995 --> 00:07:34.243
You must put a semicolon.

125
00:07:34.243 --> 00:07:37.316
It's like a period at
the end of the sentence here.

126
00:07:37.316 --> 00:07:42.030
It's punctuation to let the browser know,
I finished this complete property, pair,

127
00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.335
I'm done, I'm moving on to the next one.

128
00:07:44.335 --> 00:07:48.663
If you forget it, the browser will not
understand it and will ignore it, right?

129
00:07:48.663 --> 00:07:56.096
So make sure you're putting
your semicolons, okay?.

130
00:07:56.096 --> 00:08:00.627
So now I have this one,
which has a lot more stuff going on.

131
00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:05.015
So I just wanted to demonstrate to you,
one rule can have a lot of stuff inside of

132
00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:08.159
it, and typically will have
a lot of stuff inside of it.

133
00:08:08.159 --> 00:08:09.493
So color lime green.

134
00:08:09.493 --> 00:08:14.603
That's why this one is this
lovely shade of lime green.

135
00:08:14.603 --> 00:08:17.477
Font size 60 pixels.

136
00:08:17.477 --> 00:08:18.807
So some of these have units, right?

137
00:08:18.807 --> 00:08:20.660
So pixels is px, right?

138
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:22.162
It's 60 pixels high.

139
00:08:22.162 --> 00:08:23.719
It's actually usually not literally that.

140
00:08:23.719 --> 00:08:26.404
It's just like a relative measurement.

141
00:08:26.404 --> 00:08:30.687
There's also several styles of size.

142
00:08:30.687 --> 00:08:35.976
So we use pixels but there's Ms
there's Xs there's vertical heights.

143
00:08:35.976 --> 00:08:40.321
There's a ton of different ways
to measure widths and heights but

144
00:08:40.321 --> 00:08:42.139
pixels is the most common.

145
00:08:42.139 --> 00:08:47.731
So in other words if you put font size
60 with nothing, it won't do anything.

146
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:49.807
Right.
It's like asking someone how tall are you?

147
00:08:49.807 --> 00:08:51.964
And they just say, I'm three.

148
00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:53.099
Three, what?

149
00:08:53.099 --> 00:08:54.334
You have to tell them what?

150
00:08:54.334 --> 00:08:57.693
I'm three feet, three meters,
three yards, right?

151
00:08:57.693 --> 00:09:00.445
So that's what this is here.

152
00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:01.616
Font, weight, normal.

153
00:09:01.616 --> 00:09:07.132
That's saying instead of being bolded,
be normally, right?

154
00:09:07.132 --> 00:09:13.201
So it's not bolded, but
you can also have light as well.

155
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:16.211
So if I put bold there, right?

156
00:09:16.211 --> 00:09:17.948
Or I think there's a lighter, right?

157
00:09:17.948 --> 00:09:21.029
Some fonts don't have lighter.

158
00:09:21.029 --> 00:09:25.899
But there's like 600,
900, that's really bold.

159
00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:30.762
If you have 100, looks like this doesn't
have a 100, but that'd be really thin.

160
00:09:30.762 --> 00:09:32.308
It depends on each font, right?

161
00:09:32.308 --> 00:09:34.311
Some fonts have it some fonts don't.

162
00:09:38.965 --> 00:09:40.329
What else here?

163
00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:43.668
Text decoration right?

164
00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:46.978
Underlined so that's why this is
underlined now you might ask me hey Brian,

165
00:09:46.978 --> 00:09:49.625
how do you know that text
decoration underline go together?

166
00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:52.458
It's like I don't ever remember I
always have to Google it Right.

167
00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:54.579
So I just Google CSS underline and

168
00:09:54.579 --> 00:09:58.761
the first thing that shows up will
be text decoration underline.

169
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:02.225
But I mean, there's some
absurd things in here as well.

170
00:10:02.225 --> 00:10:03.607
I think there's over line.

171
00:10:03.607 --> 00:10:04.799
Yeah, there's an over line.

172
00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:09.364
I don't know why it's there, but it is.

173
00:10:09.364 --> 00:10:11.817
There might be, is it strikethrough?

174
00:10:11.817 --> 00:10:18.692
And it's not lline through.

175
00:10:18.692 --> 00:10:21.367
Yeah, so if you want to do strikethrough,
as you can see,

176
00:10:21.367 --> 00:10:23.177
all this stuff kind of comes hazy to me.

177
00:10:23.177 --> 00:10:25.678
When's the last time I
had to do strikethrough?

178
00:10:25.678 --> 00:10:28.282
I don't know if I've ever
actually professionally had to do

179
00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:29.413
strikethrough, right.

180
00:10:29.413 --> 00:10:33.233
So it's probably the last
time I taught this course.

181
00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:36.950
But it's all, this is kind of what
I'm talking about I want you to be

182
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.602
exposed to things that you'll see now and
you'll never remember a strikethrough.

183
00:10:41.602 --> 00:10:45.333
But five years later when you're showing
someone else how to code, right?

184
00:10:45.333 --> 00:10:48.178
You're gonna say I remember
there is strikethrough and

185
00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:51.263
you just Google CSS strikethrough and
you'll just get it right?

186
00:10:51.263 --> 00:10:53.663
That's things that you know
that you don't know, all right?

187
00:10:53.663 --> 00:10:57.023
It's things that you knew that you knew,
but you could remember and it could

188
00:10:57.023 --> 00:11:00.508
eventually figure out again, but you
don't have to on the tip of your tongue.

189
00:11:00.508 --> 00:11:02.735
That's most of programming by the way.

190
00:11:02.735 --> 00:11:04.223
It's a bunch of stuff that you know,

191
00:11:04.223 --> 00:11:06.249
plus a bunch of stuff that
you could Google later.

192
00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:10.491
Okay, so we'll leave that as underline.

193
00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:15.993
Text transform.

194
00:11:15.993 --> 00:11:17.839
So this is all uppercase now.

195
00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:21.061
So notice this one up here, this is an H1.

196
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:24.713
Notice this wasn't all uppercased.

197
00:11:24.713 --> 00:11:25.507
But here it is.

198
00:11:25.507 --> 00:11:27.795
That's it this text transform does.

199
00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:31.839
As you might imagine, you can change
this from uppercase to lowercase.

200
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:36.170
And now everything is lowercase.

201
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:38.862
There's capitalize right?

202
00:11:38.862 --> 00:11:42.076
Which will capitalize
the beginning of everything.

203
00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:45.699
There's some other ones full width.

204
00:11:45.699 --> 00:11:48.489
I didn't even know that was
a thing until literally right now.

205
00:11:48.489 --> 00:11:49.275
Full size can't.

206
00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:54.412
I'm gonna guess that probably goes
with Japanese or some other language.

207
00:11:54.412 --> 00:11:59.013
So you'll find that's another thing here
is lots of these have to do with other

208
00:11:59.013 --> 00:12:03.057
languages besides English because
rightfully so the internet is for

209
00:12:03.057 --> 00:12:04.816
everybody in all languages.

210
00:12:04.816 --> 00:12:07.488
So they also have their uppercase and

211
00:12:07.488 --> 00:12:12.745
lowercase built into that because
uppercase and lowercase is a thing for

212
00:12:12.745 --> 00:12:17.240
Latin based languages and
Latin character based languages.

213
00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:22.061
But it's not a thing for other languages
that have no concept of uppercase and

214
00:12:22.061 --> 00:12:22.887
lowercase.

215
00:12:22.887 --> 00:12:28.321
I remember I worked on the Turkish
translation of netflix.com,

216
00:12:28.321 --> 00:12:34.269
we had text transform to uppercase
in several places on netflix.com.

217
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:36.836
Apparently that breaks Turkish.

218
00:12:36.836 --> 00:12:40.437
I'm trying to remember it was Turkish or
Arabic or something.

219
00:12:40.437 --> 00:12:43.723
It was a language I was working on
unfortunately don't remember which

220
00:12:43.723 --> 00:12:44.233
one it is.

221
00:12:44.233 --> 00:12:47.321
But we had to take it out of everywhere
because it didn't make sense in some of

222
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:49.557
the languages that we were
translating Netflix into.

223
00:12:49.557 --> 00:12:53.209
So that's some things to be aware of.

224
00:12:53.209 --> 00:12:57.237
We have a border of three pixels in pink.

225
00:12:57.237 --> 00:12:59.863
This can be changed to orange, right?

226
00:12:59.863 --> 00:13:08.197
This can be changed to dotted or line.

227
00:13:08.197 --> 00:13:10.242
I don't know.
There's a bunch of other,

228
00:13:10.242 --> 00:13:11.398
was line working?

229
00:13:11.398 --> 00:13:14.286
No it wasn't.

230
00:13:14.286 --> 00:13:16.499
Dashed, there it is.

231
00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:20.316
So there's a bunch of
way of doing borders.

232
00:13:20.316 --> 00:13:23.188
Let's go back to.

233
00:13:23.188 --> 00:13:26.188
Oops, just refresh the page.

234
00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:34.915
You can come in here and say border
dash radius and say five pixels.

235
00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:38.684
Notice there that makes it like
a nice little rounded corner there.

236
00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:42.919
Or we can put 15 pixels it
gets even more rounded.

237
00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:46.797
100 pixels and then it just ends
up being round at the end, right?

238
00:13:46.797 --> 00:13:49.186
So you can do anything you want with CSS.

239
00:13:49.186 --> 00:13:54.465
You can take things that look one way and
make them look another way.

240
00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:58.531
And it's all just like this combination
of making these selectors with

241
00:13:58.531 --> 00:14:02.461
rules with all these properties that
kind of interact with each other

242
00:14:02.461 --> 00:14:05.391
to create whatever you're
trying to make happen.

243
00:14:05.391 --> 00:14:10.741
A question that I had when I was
learning to code is why is it font dash

244
00:14:10.741 --> 00:14:16.205
something sometimes and
why is it text dash something other times?

245
00:14:16.205 --> 00:14:18.269
Well, one it is because it is.

246
00:14:18.269 --> 00:14:20.954
But the real answer to that is
think about the font, right?

247
00:14:20.954 --> 00:14:24.416
So when you're on Word,
you can select a different font, right?

248
00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:27.033
You're actually changing character sets.

249
00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.224
So that's what font is it's actually
messing with the character set

250
00:14:30.224 --> 00:14:32.490
that the glyphs that
you're interacting with.

251
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:36.018
Whereas the text stuff actually just
interacts with the text itself,

252
00:14:36.018 --> 00:14:38.309
it doesn't mess with the glyph set, right?

253
00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:42.227
So when I underlined something,
it doesn't modify the glyphs set.

254
00:14:42.227 --> 00:14:45.188
It's just drawing a line underneath it and

255
00:14:45.188 --> 00:14:49.467
I'm transforming the text from
lowercase to uppercase, but

256
00:14:49.467 --> 00:14:54.332
doesn't matter if the glyph says
changes which glyph it's showing.

257
00:14:54.332 --> 00:14:56.146
You never have to care about that.

258
00:14:56.146 --> 00:15:00.518
That was something that bothered me for
years after I learned to write CSS, and

259
00:15:00.518 --> 00:15:02.915
I finally bothered to
look it up once time.

260
00:15:02.915 --> 00:15:07.410
So I try and throw little tidbits in
there of things that used to bother me so

261
00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.379
they don't have to bother you.

262
00:15:09.379 --> 00:15:12.335
So yeah, parents and children.

263
00:15:12.335 --> 00:15:16.822
I have div here and I have a selector
here that says div, color, blue.

264
00:15:16.822 --> 00:15:18.306
That'll actually permeate
down here to the children.

265
00:15:18.306 --> 00:15:21.913
So you can have parents
CSS affect children.

266
00:15:21.913 --> 00:15:25.737
I found that frustrated me when
I was learning to code is like,

267
00:15:25.737 --> 00:15:30.667
why is this one blue and it's because I
had a parent that was permeating it's CSS

268
00:15:30.667 --> 00:15:32.525
cascading down to the child.

269
00:15:34.894 --> 00:15:39.402
So, you'll notice I use some
terminology here for parents and child.

270
00:15:39.402 --> 00:15:44.813
The parent will be the outer the HTML tag
and the child will be the inner HTML tag.

271
00:15:44.813 --> 00:15:51.648
That's common terminology
when talking about HTML.

272
00:15:51.648 --> 00:15:57.459
So even if I do body here and I have this
h1 here, that's all the way nested down,

273
00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:03.381
this the body color orange will permeate
all the way down here to this h1, right?

274
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:04.910
It just affects everything inside of it.
