00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.405
We are gonna talk about Pseudo-classes and
pseudo elements.

2
00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:10.280
This is more for completeness, a little
bit more of an advanced topic when it

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.716
comes to CSS, but I just want you
to be aware that they're out there.

4
00:00:14.716 --> 00:00:19.129
So what happens if you wanna do
something conditionally, right?

5
00:00:19.129 --> 00:00:20.367
So for example,

6
00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:25.501
I have this like box here this is
hovering your mouse over me, right.

7
00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:31.932
Now if you hover your mouse over it,
it changes color and it changes size.

8
00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:36.215
This here is called a Pseudo class.

9
00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:42.891
So it has this base style of width 100,
height 100,

10
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:45.895
background-color and color, right?

11
00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:48.897
And then if you hover
over it with this colon,

12
00:00:48.897 --> 00:00:52.229
the colon being the key part of this here,
right.

13
00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.459
This applies this class only conditionally
if that hover state is true.

14
00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:02.628
Changes the background color width and
height and you end up with this.

15
00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:06.138
Kind of cool somewhat interactive thing,
right?

16
00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:12.867
There are many CSS pseudo classes
I'm just showing you one of them.

17
00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:17.183
So one thing to keep in mind when
you're doing like hover for example,

18
00:01:17.183 --> 00:01:18.876
how do you hover on iPhone?

19
00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:24.067
You don't, right?

20
00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:24.783
There's no hover, right?

21
00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.807
You don't have a mouse.

22
00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:29.605
It does kind of apply some trickery like
if you touch it sometimes it requires

23
00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:30.228
you to touch it.

24
00:01:30.228 --> 00:01:34.343
To twice the first actual hover
the second touch will click on it but for

25
00:01:34.343 --> 00:01:37.505
all intents and
purposes you can't hover on mobile.

26
00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:43.770
So if you're intending for your site
to work on mobile avoid hover states.

27
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.254
That it is useful sometimes, what's a good
example I'll show you one a good example.

28
00:01:49.254 --> 00:01:53.202
Here on this web course
website if you hover over the,

29
00:01:53.202 --> 00:01:57.691
you can see this little stripes
in the corner changes color.

30
00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:03.515
That's done by using a CSS hover effect.

31
00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:08.459
And it's just like a little nice little
touch if a person on mobile never sees

32
00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.567
that it's totally fine,
it's just like a little flair to it.

33
00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:16.009
That's when you should use something
like cover it's should never be for

34
00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.842
core functionality otherwise you're
excluding all your mobile users which most

35
00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:20.916
of us don't wanna do.

36
00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:24.382
But if you're doing like corporate
intranet where it's like someone

37
00:02:24.382 --> 00:02:27.738
like accountants are always gonna
use on their desktop computers.

38
00:02:27.738 --> 00:02:28.797
Then it doesn't matter, right?

39
00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:32.047
They're always gonna be doing that
they're not gonna be on their iPhones,

40
00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:34.602
browsing yours, spreadsheet app or
something like that.

41
00:02:36.026 --> 00:02:37.945
In other words, just in general,

42
00:02:37.945 --> 00:02:41.594
with web dev, your audience is
always the most important thing.

43
00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.423
Who are you building this website for?

44
00:02:43.423 --> 00:02:45.586
You need to continually ask
yourself that question.

45
00:02:46.954 --> 00:02:51.998
Okay, Let's talk about another one.

46
00:02:51.998 --> 00:02:55.589
So I have this first child example and
the color is crimson, right?

47
00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:59.018
So I have this First, Second and Third.

48
00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:03.389
And then I have this one here,
where it says first-child example so

49
00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.692
matches this exact same first class, but
then I have this colon, first-child.

50
00:03:09.866 --> 00:03:13.645
What color our Second and Third gonna be?

51
00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:14.348
&gt;&gt; Crimson.

52
00:03:14.348 --> 00:03:16.520
&gt;&gt; Crimson, what color is first gonna be?

53
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.370
&gt;&gt; Limegreen.

54
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.168
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so first-child is gonna be select
only the first one in the list, right?

55
00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:28.863
The first one that matches this,
so you can see here this is First.

56
00:03:28.863 --> 00:03:34.018
So what's cool about this is now this is
kinda like resistant to change over time.

57
00:03:34.018 --> 00:03:39.603
So let's say, suddenly we wanna start
counting from 0 so we can put 0 there.

58
00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:45.859
I didn't have to go change anything else,
my CSS just worked right away.

59
00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.225
Because the other way you could have done
this as you could have just put First here

60
00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.216
and unstyled based on the first class,
right?

61
00:03:51.216 --> 00:03:53.289
Totally would have been valid but

62
00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.520
here styling by the structure of
this makes some sense that so that.

63
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.142
If later this changes which
it did when I added 0,

64
00:04:00.142 --> 00:04:02.086
everything just worked right away.

65
00:04:03.722 --> 00:04:05.390
What happens if I change this too?

66
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.980
Last-child.

67
00:04:07.844 --> 00:04:08.860
Same thing, right?

68
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.358
It only will do the last one.

69
00:04:13.377 --> 00:04:15.976
So that's another Pseudo-class,
it ends up being super useful.

70
00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:22.312
So another really good example of
when you might wanna use this.

71
00:04:22.312 --> 00:04:26.090
Let's say, I wanna have a nice
black line between all of these.

72
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.629
So if I put a border bottom
which is like border but

73
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:35.073
it's only gonna do the bottom border,
right?

74
00:04:35.073 --> 00:04:41.426
One pixel solid black, So

75
00:04:41.426 --> 00:04:44.358
they all have this like bottom black line,
but

76
00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:48.350
what happens if I only wanted it
between them and not at the end?

77
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.349
In other words I wanna drop this
one down here at the bottom.

78
00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:58.682
Easy to use first-child example and
you just say border, bottom, none.

79
00:04:58.682 --> 00:05:01.789
And now they have this like dividing line
we could make it look better we'd have to

80
00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.215
put some padding on bottom, right.

81
00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:07.808
So we'd have to say, padding bottom

82
00:05:07.808 --> 00:05:12.410
10 pixels or something like that?

83
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:18.261
Maybe 20 pixels, 30 pixels, 50 pixels.

84
00:05:18.261 --> 00:05:22.000
There we go, that looks a little
bit more plausible now, right?

85
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.991
And now we have this
like nice dividing line,

86
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.985
whereas if I didn't have this line, right.

87
00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:31.347
There'd be this weird last line,
and it doesn't look as nice.

88
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:38.613
Another thing I'll probably notice here
is, I guess and check a whole lot.

89
00:05:38.613 --> 00:05:43.059
The way that one writes CSS is try this,
did it work?

90
00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:44.442
No, try it again.

91
00:05:44.442 --> 00:05:46.879
And just keep doing that over and
over again until you get what you want.

92
00:05:48.713 --> 00:05:49.601
Okay?

93
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.306
So I put a link here to
Pseudo classes here.

94
00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:56.819
This is on CSS tricks again.

95
00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.988
There's so many,
focus that's another one like active.

96
00:06:01.988 --> 00:06:03.210
This is another one.

97
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.211
If you're pressing a button while you're
pressing light holding the button,

98
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:09.337
that's active.

99
00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:13.847
Focus can be, if you click on a input and

100
00:06:13.847 --> 00:06:20.968
that they're cursors in
the input that's focused, right.

101
00:06:20.968 --> 00:06:25.739
If you have an a tag and you want your
visited tags to look different than your

102
00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:29.473
unvisited tags,
you can do that with a selector that way.

103
00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:35.693
Target, enabled, there's so
many of these that I'm just not even

104
00:06:35.693 --> 00:06:40.711
gonna get into them first nth-of-type,
first-of-type, okay?

105
00:06:40.711 --> 00:06:45.459
I'm gonna stop there because there's a
whole article here but you get it, right?

106
00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:48.507
There's these conditional
Pseudo class selectors.
