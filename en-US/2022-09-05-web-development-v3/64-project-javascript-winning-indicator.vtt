00:00:00.899 --> 00:00:04.583
Okay, I think we have one last thing to
do, which is definitely the best part.

2
00:00:04.583 --> 00:00:07.507
When we win,
there needs to be rainbow colors, right?

3
00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:11.271
I mean, I thought about doing something
like the, do you remember solitaire,

4
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:13.813
when you win and
every other cards would bounce down?

5
00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:16.649
I thought about doing that with all the
tiles, which would have been sweet, but

6
00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:17.806
it would have taken a long time.

7
00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:21.676
I started coding, I was like, I can't make
these poor students spend like an hour

8
00:00:21.676 --> 00:00:23.260
with me writing bouncing tiles.

9
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.900
[LAUGH] It would have been fun, believe
me, but we're not gonna do that today.

10
00:00:32.368 --> 00:00:36.710
Last thing here.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.631
I just do it directly
in the wind condition.

12
00:00:38.631 --> 00:00:40.312
So let's just do it there.

13
00:00:40.312 --> 00:00:44.075
Where is our wind condition?

14
00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:48.134
Hear, where we win,
we definitely just need to say,

15
00:00:48.134 --> 00:00:52.389
document.query, actually,
is it just the info bar?

16
00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.613
Which one is it?

17
00:00:54.613 --> 00:00:55.949
Yeah, query selector.

18
00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.039
And we're just gonna grab the brand,
.brand,

19
00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:03.839
which is the word masters at the top,
right?

20
00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:11.991
And then we're just gonna say
.classList.add, and what do I call it?

21
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:14.920
Win, winner.

22
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.907
I refresh the wordy masters now and
I say, ivory.

23
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.271
Now check that distance out.

24
00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:30.491
Now the person feels like a winner, right?

25
00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:37.619
That is it.

26
00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.399
That's the whole wordy masters.

27
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.410
And again, if you get sick
of guessing the word ivory,

28
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.082
all you gotta do is come in here and

29
00:01:49.082 --> 00:01:54.050
say, Random equals one.

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.833
And now I legitimately do not know
what the word's gonna come back here.

31
00:01:59.355 --> 00:02:04.936
No I'm not gonna try and

32
00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:09.274
guess, cuz this will take me too long and
I'll be very embarrassed about it.

33
00:02:09.274 --> 00:02:13.174
But we can cheat and
look at the network tab, which by the way,

34
00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:18.734
you can totally do with Wordle [LAUGH] No,
I wasn't tracking it.

35
00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:20.509
So I actually don't know
what it's gonna be.

36
00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.172
But I could just say pools,
anyway, whatever.

37
00:02:26.172 --> 00:02:27.059
Gone to the sands of time.

38
00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:34.766
So, that's word masters.

39
00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:36.820
&gt;&gt; How long did it take you to do this?

40
00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:46.027
End-to-end, it probably took me, I'm gonna
say, it takes me a bit longer cuz I'm

41
00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:50.277
trying to write it really simple link,
like coding, so that you can do.

42
00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:52.956
If I was just gonna do this
straight up for just myself and

43
00:02:52.956 --> 00:02:56.672
not really care about teaching it,
I could probably do in like 45 minutes.

44
00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:04.194
Give or take, 25 minutes and
getting caught in some weird bug.

45
00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:06.880
If I was new and getting started coding,

46
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.885
this would probably take
me a couple of days.

47
00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:13.805
Yeah, this is difficult,
I'm throwing hard things at you.

48
00:03:13.805 --> 00:03:18.288
But also the thing that, like for
me when I was starting out coding and

49
00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:22.461
coding some of these bigger projects,
I spent weeks of my life,

50
00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:26.966
perhaps multiple months,
working on chess, for one of my classes.

51
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:30.668
A full chess game and
coding all that stuff.

52
00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:33.238
I'm still proud of that program, right?

53
00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:37.169
And so, that's why I kinda throw some
of these hard curveballs at you,

54
00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.193
because you learn so
much by struggling through them.

55
00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:44.882
So even if it gets frustrating, it's hard,
pushing through it, you'll be both mad and

56
00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:46.331
learning at the same time.

57
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:47.289
And I'm okay with that.

58
00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:48.976
I'm okay upsetting you a little bit.

59
00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:50.414
But I don't wanna discourage you.

60
00:03:50.414 --> 00:03:54.337
That's the balance there,
that we try and strike.

61
00:03:54.337 --> 00:03:55.352
So please don't get discouraged it's hard.

62
00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:03.896
Yeah, it's a good exercise.

63
00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.599
And again, you have the answers all there.

64
00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.840
If you wanna go see how I did it, it's
all totally there in the course notes.
