1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.950
Grid.

2
00:00:03.547 --> 00:00:05.770
It's more than the world of Tron.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.870
Anyone, any Tron fans?

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.920
No, just me.

5
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.860
I liked Tron, it was a good movie.

6
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.529
I just like the soundtrack,
if I'm being totally honest.

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.592
Anyway, it's a CSS property.

8
00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:24.856
So this is the latest and
greatest way to do CSS.

9
00:00:24.856 --> 00:00:26.805
This wasn't in the previous
version of this course,

10
00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:28.600
because it was too new at that point.

11
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.528
But now I'm pretty safe to say most people
can ship grid on their website with

12
00:00:33.528 --> 00:00:35.530
unprefixed it'll just work.

13
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.835
So grid is exactly what it sounds like,
it allows you to set out.

14
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:44.385
CSS elements in a grid like fashion,

15
00:00:44.385 --> 00:00:49.610
it's really useful for
like laying out entire pages.

16
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.431
So let's get into what I mean with that.

17
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.854
So I have all these lovely
pictures of Luna, good doggie, and

18
00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:03.010
they're laid out in just like
a nice little grid pattern, right?

19
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.340
With grid that's really easy to do,
you say display grid, so to display flex.

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.262
I tell it how I wanted to lay out things
and I just want something that's just,

21
00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:15.200
I want two on a row.

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.810
So, one fraction I think,
that's what it stands for.

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.750
So ,one fraction,
one fraction which means 50-50, right?

24
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.625
And give it a row-gap aka gutter
on the row side of 10 pixels and

25
00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:37.700
a column gap, are a gutter on
the column side of 10 pixels.

26
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.236
And then the grid pictures I took all
the way, all the margin and padding and

27
00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:43.540
that's what we got.

28
00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:51.212
Before you would have had to do like
clever margins and float left and

29
00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:54.460
a bunch of stuff like that
to get this to lay out.

30
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.630
So easy with this.

31
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.247
If I want to change it to be an all in
one row, all I gotta do is that and

32
00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:03.818
I'll send it will rearrange them
as being everything on one row.

33
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.706
So that's what that 1fr is,
it's just saying like I just want this

34
00:02:11.706 --> 00:02:15.923
many if I put one like this,
it should have three on one row and

35
00:02:15.923 --> 00:02:19.602
then we'll have one row
with just one on it, right?

36
00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:23.930
As you might imagine, if I wanted them to
be each on their own row, there you go.

37
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.409
So that's what the grid template columns
does is it just allows you to lay it out

38
00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.710
on however you want
the columns to look and

39
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.109
then it'll just figure it out from there.

40
00:02:37.214 --> 00:02:41.010
So powerful, this is again,
I want you to understand this.

41
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.821
This is so much better than it used to be.

42
00:02:46.346 --> 00:02:46.855
Okay.

43
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.474
So that's what those are.

44
00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.745
Yeah, that's another thing
that might be useful to you.

45
00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.995
So 1fr,
1fr just said like they're equal sizes.

46
00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:03.695
If for whatever reason you wanted
the second column to be bigger, right?

47
00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:05.035
Now the first one is smaller.

48
00:03:05.035 --> 00:03:07.579
So this is a smaller dog picture and
this is a larger dog picture.

49
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.925
Or you wanted to have like
a big one in the middle and

50
00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:16.490
then smaller ones on the side, right?

51
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.720
All of these are very possible.

52
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.098
So the fr is just saying like
one fractional thing and

53
00:03:22.098 --> 00:03:25.420
like it'll automatically figure out
what the percentages that it has to do,

54
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.870
and it'll include the gutters.

55
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.780
If you do like the row gap and the column
gap, it just does all that math for

56
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.910
you so you don't have to figure it out.

57
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.134
When I worked my very first dev job,
I did a lot of PHP,

58
00:03:36.134 --> 00:03:39.649
I literally had a calculator at my desk so
I could figure out

59
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.912
what the pixels were going to be or
like the correct percentages to do.

60
00:03:43.912 --> 00:03:44.492
Silly stuff,

61
00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:49.280
silly stuff you don't have to do anymore
&gt;&gt; When did they introduce this?

62
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.373
Because I remember kind of
[CROSSTALK] like I want

63
00:03:53.373 --> 00:03:56.555
something in the middle of the page.

64
00:03:56.555 --> 00:03:58.900
&gt;&gt; Can I use as a blessing?

65
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.144
You can just search for something and

66
00:04:02.144 --> 00:04:07.794
it'll tell you the support across
all browsers, so right now,

67
00:04:07.794 --> 00:04:12.513
94.29% of current web
traffic supports grid.

68
00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:17.642
And you can see there we're
missing it on Opera Mini,

69
00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:21.584
old Internet Explorer, that's
probably what takes it down so much.

70
00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:26.656
Old versions of Edge, but
Chrome since looks like

71
00:04:26.656 --> 00:04:33.340
52 which released in 2017,
and or that was Firefox.

72
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.120
But yeah 2017 basically is when like
really good support started going

73
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.606
&gt;&gt; Fun before, yeah,

74
00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:42.684
I was just new to me cool.

75
00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:43.308
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

76
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:52.497
So, tracks desktop if you do that,
okay plus that.

77
00:04:55.955 --> 00:05:01.681
So if you click Filter this will get it
probably down to more which are expected,

78
00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:03.375
and anywhere.

79
00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.985
You need to check it
relative to your traffic.

80
00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:11.716
So for example, Netflix for example didn't
see almost any traffic from UC Browser for

81
00:05:11.716 --> 00:05:13.845
Android which is more popular.

82
00:05:13.845 --> 00:05:18.485
I wanna say second India, anyway other
parts of the world, whereas like Netflix

83
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:22.825
at that time had no traffic because
we didn't support India at the time.

84
00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:24.035
Netflix does now support India.

85
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.348
So we've basically got to
ignore that browser, but

86
00:05:27.348 --> 00:05:29.370
it doesn't have the best support for
everything.

87
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.124
So, we could kind of use
more modern techniques,

88
00:05:32.124 --> 00:05:34.560
because they're only 4% is not the best.

89
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.867
You want to be like 99% generally.

90
00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.500
Yeah, there's a lot of stuff here.

91
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.126
Anyway, can I use website?

92
00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:51.055
MDN will have a lot of
that information as well.

93
00:05:55.953 --> 00:05:56.713
Cool.

94
00:05:58.522 --> 00:06:05.610
So, let's take a more
complicated look at this.

95
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.400
That was a basic example of just
laying out pictures on a page.

96
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.045
But let's say we wanna achieve this,
where we have like a header,

97
00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:15.580
which goes all the way across
until you hit a sidebar.

98
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.560
We wanna have a body here and
the you want to skip a little bit here.

99
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.442
And then we wanna have a footer
that goes all the way across and

100
00:06:24.442 --> 00:06:28.575
we want this sidebar to go
span two different rows.

101
00:06:28.575 --> 00:06:31.708
I imagine this is like
the header of your website,

102
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:36.555
this would be like the body which would
be super long, so let's say the body,

103
00:06:36.555 --> 00:06:42.220
let's just give this a height of like
600 pixels like something really tall.

104
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:50.404
Notice that the sidebar automatically
scaled to match that as well, right?

105
00:06:50.404 --> 00:06:54.496
So that's what this is doing for us,

106
00:06:54.496 --> 00:06:59.257
we get this like a height of 100 pixels.

107
00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:02.910
Get this like a nice height there.

108
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.163
We're letting sidebar just
kind of dynamically scale and

109
00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:10.380
we'll give this a height of 200 pixels.

110
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.570
And now this has like a nice
thick height as well.

111
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:18.370
So you can imagine like laying out your
entire website using grid like this,

112
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:18.897
right?

113
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:24.275
One of my favorite ways to use grid is
you can just identify as like all right,

114
00:07:24.275 --> 00:07:29.620
grid area you'll give it a name, so
you get to choose this name, right?

115
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.089
Doesn't have to be the name of the class,
it can be anything,

116
00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:36.048
I just call it nav header,
this one is the main body.

117
00:07:36.048 --> 00:07:39.560
This is the nav side and
this is the footer, right?

118
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:46.454
Then I can come down here to my page
which is overlaying everything and

119
00:07:46.454 --> 00:07:50.369
I can just use English to
describe what I want to build.

120
00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:55.339
So nav header, nav header, so I want
this to take two slots here which you

121
00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:58.760
can see here it does or
three slots, right?

122
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.636
Nav header, nav header, nav header and
then nav site at the end.

123
00:08:03.636 --> 00:08:08.123
Then main body, main body, so two, right?

124
00:08:08.123 --> 00:08:11.989
So it goes to,
I put a period to signify skip this,

125
00:08:11.989 --> 00:08:14.946
put nothing here, and then nav site.

126
00:08:14.946 --> 00:08:18.595
So it can see that these
two are the same thing, so

127
00:08:18.595 --> 00:08:24.215
it'll squish them together and then I
want footer to go all the way across.

128
00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:29.117
And the browser just slices and dices that
picks it apart and makes a layout for

129
00:08:29.117 --> 00:08:30.335
you based on that.

130
00:08:33.032 --> 00:08:35.712
I can just wanna emphasize that this
used to be so much harder to do.

131
00:08:35.712 --> 00:08:40.160
[LAUGH] I feel like I keep saying that,
but it's the damn truth, right?

132
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.732
This was so much harder to do, and now I
just get to describe it in English and

133
00:08:43.732 --> 00:08:45.380
it just works.

134
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.530
Now, you can see I put spaces
here to get this all the lineup.

135
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.540
It doesn't have to do that.

136
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.390
I just did that for clarity sake.

137
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.170
But you're welcome to just do like
this and it'll figure it out.

138
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.434
You don't have to put that whitespace.

139
00:09:02.951 --> 00:09:08.983
So you can actually even start combining
these things, and I can say grid,

140
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:14.630
template, columns and I can say that
I want my first one to take 1fr and

141
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.260
then I say 2fr this space here
wind up being a lot bigger.

142
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.716
And now notice that this,

143
00:09:22.716 --> 00:09:27.057
despite the fact that this is only
taking up one column here and

144
00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:32.580
notice that main body and the period here,
end up being the same size, right?

145
00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:37.533
They're both technically two fractions
because I made this column here

146
00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:39.000
take two fractions.

147
00:09:40.385 --> 00:09:43.985
And then if I go back here to 1fr,
that'll be like that, or

148
00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:46.218
let's say I want that to be so small.

149
00:09:48.579 --> 00:09:51.761
So now this little gutter here ends up
being really small because everything else

150
00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:52.848
is taking 10 fractions.

151
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.341
So it's cool you can kind of combined
all the different properties to get this

152
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:01.743
very specific layout
that you're looking for.

153
00:10:05.393 --> 00:10:09.423
I just get really excited about grid
because it made something that was so

154
00:10:09.423 --> 00:10:10.622
hard my life so easy.

155
00:10:14.397 --> 00:10:19.382
So, again I'm just scratching the surface
here of what's possible with grid,

156
00:10:19.382 --> 00:10:22.316
and I think Jen Kramer
again CSS teacher here for

157
00:10:22.316 --> 00:10:26.129
front of masters has a whole course
that goes into the depth and

158
00:10:26.129 --> 00:10:29.384
the amazingness that you
can accomplish with grid.

159
00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:36.859
One of the things they didn't
talk about in this course,

160
00:10:36.859 --> 00:10:40.990
is you can make your website responsive so
that on narrow screens,

161
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.570
it looks one way,
on wide screens it looks another way.

162
00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:49.389
The nice thing about flex and grid is
if you just switch a couple properties,

163
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:53.832
they say like, hey, this size making so
everything's in columns and

164
00:10:53.832 --> 00:10:57.060
then this size it's everything's in rows.

165
00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:02.504
It'll just like switch the entire layout
with a couple of different things and

166
00:11:02.504 --> 00:11:05.236
it just makes everything really easy.

167
00:11:09.853 --> 00:11:13.689
So in other words, grid and
flex make responsive design very easy.

168
00:11:16.167 --> 00:11:22.170
Okay, so I left you a link to CSS tricks,
if you want to read more about it.

169
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:25.191
I left you a link to Jen's class
if you want to learn more about it

170
00:11:25.191 --> 00:11:28.668
from Jen who has a lot of depth in this
sort of stuff and is a great teacher.
