1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.240
Welcome to the Complete Intro
to Web Dev version 3.

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.530
Today, we're going to learn to write
websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.090
So the first thing I want you to do just
right now is to hop on to this particular

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.165
course website that you're looking here.

5
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:18.222
We're gonna spend all of our time today,
or

6
00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:21.623
most of our time today anyway,
in this website.

7
00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:27.967
So you can either just go directly
to this URL that we have here,

8
00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:32.876
or you can just type bit.ly/webdev-v3, and

9
00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:38.401
that'll take you directly
to the site as well, okay?

10
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:42.070
So just to kind of orient you on
how this website works, we have all

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.499
these various different sections and
there's lessons within the sections.

12
00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:51.095
And so if I click on the introduction
here, you can see I have Introduction and

13
00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.450
Welcome to the Class.

14
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.150
So this is the section and
this is the lesson that we're in.

15
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.814
So if you get lost or if you hop ahead
into a different lesson or something like

16
00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:02.210
that, you can always look at the header
to see where I am in the course.

17
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.981
Okay, so this, as I said,
is the third version of intro to web dev.

18
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:13.504
You do not have to have taken
previous versions of web devs.

19
00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:15.120
You don't have to take v2 or v1.

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.432
This is a total revision of it.

21
00:01:16.432 --> 00:01:18.982
We just try and keep it fresh,
so I come back every so often,

22
00:01:18.982 --> 00:01:21.279
make sure that it has the most
accurate information,

23
00:01:21.279 --> 00:01:24.000
the most up-to-date practices,
all those kinds of things.

24
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.157
So I wrote this course to help people
go from not knowing how to code,

25
00:01:29.157 --> 00:01:32.025
wanting to create websites to
having some sort of idea so

26
00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.910
that they can express it and
share that on the Internet.

27
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.570
So you do not need to know how
to code to start this course.

28
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.664
It's gonna be helpful if you
know about computers, right?

29
00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:47.166
You need to know where
the power button is.

30
00:01:47.166 --> 00:01:50.890
You need to know how to open a browser,
those sorts of things.

31
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.640
If that kind of stuff is unfamiliar to
you, there is a awesome course already

32
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.297
available to you for
free called Internet Fundamentals.

33
00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:03.810
And I think I have a link to it
down here to Internet Fundamentals.

34
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.200
I'll just show you that here really quick.

35
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.014
You can just hop in,
don't even have to create an account.

36
00:02:07.014 --> 00:02:09.120
You can just hop in,
start watching videos right away.

37
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.808
So thanks, Frontend Masters,
for creating that.

38
00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:14.982
It's taught by the awesome instructor,
Jen Kramer,

39
00:02:14.982 --> 00:02:17.750
another Frontend Masters instructor, okay?

40
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.523
So throughout the course
of this workshop course,

41
00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:28.920
we're going to go from learning
HTML to CSS to JavaScript.

42
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.069
And I'll kinda talk about what
those are here in just a second.

43
00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.615
And we're gonna go from not knowing
how to code to eventually creating

44
00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:36.465
a Wordle clone.

45
00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:38.756
And if you're not familiar with Wordle,

46
00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:43.650
it's that app that's sold to the New York
Times for several millions of dollars.

47
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.063
So by the end of this class, you will have
the skills to create a million dollar app.

48
00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:50.186
I'm not saying that you're going to.

49
00:02:50.186 --> 00:02:54.628
That's not a promise [LAUGH] but
you could, right?

50
00:02:56.721 --> 00:02:59.295
So, again, who is this course for?

51
00:02:59.295 --> 00:03:00.679
Hopefully it's for you.

52
00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.998
I tried to create it for you.

53
00:03:02.998 --> 00:03:05.782
If you have those kind of
Internet fundamental skills,

54
00:03:05.782 --> 00:03:08.390
you should be good to go already.

55
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.490
This class is gonna teach you HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript,

56
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.590
which are the three necessary components
to creating a website from scratch.

57
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.359
It'll be helpful if you've
done something like Java or

58
00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.987
C++ or something like that before,
but not wholly necessary.

59
00:03:23.987 --> 00:03:26.520
We'll learn the fundamentals
of coding here together.

60
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.199
This website is free forever,
so it's open source.

61
00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.644
You can share this website
with your friends.

62
00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.749
The videos will be free forever, so

63
00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.960
you can also share these with
your friends on Frontend Masters.

64
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.384
Next thing I wanted to
talk about is the setup,

65
00:03:40.384 --> 00:03:43.750
the things that you will need to
get started with this workshop.

66
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.370
You'll need a laptop of some variety.

67
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.560
This would be really hard
to do on a mobile phone.

68
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.826
So anything that has MacOS or
Windows 10 or above,

69
00:03:52.826 --> 00:03:55.352
Windows 11 would be fine as well.

70
00:03:55.352 --> 00:04:00.364
Or something like Ubuntu,
Linux, or something like that.

71
00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:04.401
8 gigs of RAM would get you through this
course perfectly, but you could probably

72
00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:08.690
do most of this on 4, maybe even 2 gigs of
RAM, you'd probably be okay with all this.

73
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.515
None of this should be very
computationally difficult.

74
00:04:11.515 --> 00:04:16.032
So I'll be using Visual Studio Code
throughout the course of this.

75
00:04:16.032 --> 00:04:21.821
I will be giving you kind of tips and
tricks of how to use Visual Studio Code.

76
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.440
I was on the VS Code team, so
I'm a little bit biased about that.

77
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.516
So you can use other editors, but I'll
be showing you the Visual Studio Code.

78
00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:36.745
I'm just gonna suggest that you install
Visual Studio Code for this course.

79
00:04:36.745 --> 00:04:39.190
And then I just wanted to kind
of answer some questions.

80
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.134
People always ask me like,
what's your font, what's your theme,

81
00:04:42.134 --> 00:04:43.510
those kind of things.

82
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.028
So I use a font called MonoLisa.

83
00:04:45.028 --> 00:04:49.494
It's not free, but
be sure to enable ligatures, and

84
00:04:49.494 --> 00:04:53.874
we'll talk about this a ton
throughout the course.

85
00:04:53.874 --> 00:04:57.614
But it'll take an equal sign and an equal
sign, they're next to each other, and

86
00:04:57.614 --> 00:04:59.770
it'll combine them into
a longer equal sign.

87
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.598
So you'll have these special glyphs that
make it easier to read and for code.

88
00:05:08.098 --> 00:05:11.200
Otherwise, Dank Mono is a cool font.

89
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.687
Microsoft's Cascadia Code, that's another
good font to use for your coding editor.

90
00:05:16.687 --> 00:05:20.990
And specifically,
Cascadia Code is free, so that's nice.

91
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.054
For my theme, I use Dark+.

92
00:05:23.054 --> 00:05:24.696
That's the default VS Code theme.

93
00:05:24.696 --> 00:05:26.386
I just always liked it,

94
00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:31.045
though I do hop into Sarah Drasner's
Night Owl from time to time.

95
00:05:31.045 --> 00:05:33.741
For the terminal,
I use MacOS's built-in terminal.

96
00:05:33.741 --> 00:05:35.431
If I'm on Windows, I use Windows terminal.

97
00:05:35.431 --> 00:05:37.349
That's a great one as well.

98
00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.622
And then for the icons that you see in
my VS Code, it's called vscode-icons.

99
00:05:40.622 --> 00:05:42.600
I left a little link in there for
that as well.

100
00:05:44.671 --> 00:05:48.412
Cool, so where to file issues?

101
00:05:48.412 --> 00:05:52.230
If I've made a mistake in here or
if you found a spelling error,

102
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.043
this website is open source.

103
00:05:54.043 --> 00:05:59.430
You can click here, and you can see
I already have a issue open here.

104
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.343
So you can just click New Issue,
file the issue, and then we can go fix it.

105
00:06:06.343 --> 00:06:08.746
Because, again, I am only human, right?

106
00:06:08.746 --> 00:06:11.633
I make lots of spelling mistakes and
grammar mistakes in here, so

107
00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:12.587
feel free to do that.

108
00:06:15.614 --> 00:06:18.040
And then cool, so
let me give you a bit of an introduction.

109
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.545
So hopefully that's a bit about you and
why you wanna be here and

110
00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:23.080
what you're gonna learn.

111
00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.797
I'll tell you about
a little bit who I am and

112
00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:27.970
hopefully why you should trust me with
your education of learning how to code.

113
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.990
So my name is Brian Holt.

114
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.066
I am a product manager at a company called
Stripe, which is a financial tech company.

115
00:06:36.066 --> 00:06:40.179
If you've ever checked out on
something like DoorDash or Lyft or

116
00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:44.914
any sort of Shopify kind of website
like Allbirds or something like that.

117
00:06:44.914 --> 00:06:47.849
All of that,
all of the payment infrastructure and

118
00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.791
all that is run by Stripe,
and I get to work on that.

119
00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:53.755
I am the product manager of
the developer tools for Stripe.

120
00:06:53.755 --> 00:06:58.249
So I work on the Visual Studio Code
extension, the CLI, the SDKs,

121
00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:00.265
all sorts of stuff like that.

122
00:07:01.315 --> 00:07:06.677
Basically, I build tools that developers
then use to build other things.

123
00:07:06.677 --> 00:07:07.732
I've been doing that for some years.

124
00:07:07.732 --> 00:07:09.225
I did that for Visual Studio Code.

125
00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:11.025
I did it for Microsoft Azure.

126
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.253
And then before that, I was
a JavaScript developer for a decade at

127
00:07:16.253 --> 00:07:21.231
companies like LinkedIn, Netflix,
Reddit, some other smaller startups.

128
00:07:21.231 --> 00:07:23.034
So I've been doing this for a while.

129
00:07:23.034 --> 00:07:25.673
I've written a lot of code, and
I still write a lot of code.

130
00:07:25.673 --> 00:07:29.622
Between my day job where I still write
some code as a product manager to writing

131
00:07:29.622 --> 00:07:31.095
stuff at night just for fun.

132
00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:37.112
So how I learned to code,
I learned to code when I was ten.

133
00:07:37.112 --> 00:07:41.015
My older brother,
who was a engineering student at the time,

134
00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:45.320
would make me write code before
he would let me play video games.

135
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.660
Which at the time, ten-year-old
Brian was very upset about this.

136
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.788
While that was very frustrating at
the time and still screw you, Ben, it set

137
00:07:53.788 --> 00:07:59.255
me up for success for today to be a coder
and product manager and all kind of stuff.

138
00:07:59.255 --> 00:08:02.126
So while I did learn to code at ten,

139
00:08:02.126 --> 00:08:06.391
it's totally fine if you are not that age,
right?

140
00:08:06.391 --> 00:08:10.310
You don't have to be a ten-year-old to
have a career in software development.

141
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.769
I've hired 50-year-old junior
developers before, right?

142
00:08:13.769 --> 00:08:15.650
So you can do it at any age.

143
00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:20.002
So this industry is welcoming
to people of all sizes and

144
00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:23.320
shapes I guess is what I'm trying to say.

145
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:28.344
So, again,
the skills here are very learnable for

146
00:08:28.344 --> 00:08:32.280
anyone that has the perseverance to
go through and try and learn them.

147
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:37.200
And even if you're not trying to be
a software developer, that's totally fine.

148
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.907
I think coding contributes to literally
any industry that you wanna be in, right?

149
00:08:41.907 --> 00:08:46.669
I've seen lawyers and accountants use
code to make their jobs better, easier,

150
00:08:46.669 --> 00:08:48.852
faster, all those sorts of things.

151
00:08:48.852 --> 00:08:54.704
So when I'm not writing
Frontend Masters courses or

152
00:08:54.704 --> 00:08:58.036
working, I live in Seattle.

153
00:08:58.036 --> 00:08:58.843
I like to travel.

154
00:08:58.843 --> 00:09:02.492
I like to hang out with my wife and
kid, have a cute little dog.

155
00:09:02.492 --> 00:09:06.146
You will see lots of pictures of
Luna throughout this entire course,

156
00:09:06.146 --> 00:09:07.789
and I'm not sorry about that.

157
00:09:07.789 --> 00:09:08.833
I like to exercise.

158
00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:11.143
I do a lot of Peloton.

159
00:09:11.143 --> 00:09:13.992
And then I also play Overwatch and
Dota very poorly,

160
00:09:13.992 --> 00:09:16.530
usually get my butt
kicked almost every time.

161
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.177
Well, let's rephrase it, every time.

162
00:09:20.481 --> 00:09:24.306
As well as I really like scotch,
I like IPAs, I like coffee,

163
00:09:24.306 --> 00:09:25.816
those sorts of things.

164
00:09:28.047 --> 00:09:29.591
Look at that handsome gentleman.

165
00:09:32.831 --> 00:09:36.306
Feel free to catch up
with me on social media.

166
00:09:36.306 --> 00:09:39.737
I'll say that I'm not the best
at responding to DMs, so

167
00:09:39.737 --> 00:09:41.124
just be aware of that.

168
00:09:41.124 --> 00:09:42.796
But you'll usually find me on Twitter.

169
00:09:42.796 --> 00:09:43.980
That's usually where I
spend most of my time.

170
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.330
But I also have LinkedIn, GitHub.

171
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.817
And if you're on Peloton, we can race and
you can probably win there as well.

172
00:09:51.817 --> 00:09:55.236
One last request, if you have a GitHub
account, just star this repo.

173
00:09:55.236 --> 00:09:58.695
You can click there, and
you click on the star thing.

174
00:09:58.695 --> 00:10:02.369
I haven't even starred my own repo,
starred, just like that.

175
00:10:02.369 --> 00:10:07.148
[LAUGH] That helps and makes it
more discoverable for other people,

176
00:10:07.148 --> 00:10:11.430
and it also just strokes my fragile ego,
so please help me.

177
00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.373
Okay, so some expectations that
I wanna kinda level set before

178
00:10:18.373 --> 00:10:21.200
we start hopping into everything.

179
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.261
This course is really difficult.

180
00:10:24.261 --> 00:10:27.080
If you've never written code before,
this is gonna be hard.

181
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.750
There's some hard projects in this, and
I push you pretty hard in this course.

182
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.860
It's not intended to be easy,
it's intended to be useful.

183
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.050
So it's okay to get frustrated.

184
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.273
It's okay to hit the wall.

185
00:10:42.273 --> 00:10:44.210
All these feelings are valid.

186
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.960
So don't get too down on yourself.

187
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.040
The enemy here is discouragement.

188
00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.035
If you get discouraged or
burned out or something like that,

189
00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:56.360
that is where you lose,
right, and you'll fall off.

190
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.360
So it's more important for you to say,
I understand that this is hard,

191
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.460
I understand this is difficult, and
have a lot of patience for yourself.

192
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.305
But the most important thing that you
can take away from this section is don't

193
00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:08.640
compare yourself to others, right?

194
00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:13.882
It's really easy to look over at someone
that you know that writes code or

195
00:11:13.882 --> 00:11:18.352
other people on the Internet and say, this
person learned to code in 15 minutes flat.

196
00:11:18.352 --> 00:11:21.278
And it was so easy for them and
they can do all these amazing things, and

197
00:11:21.278 --> 00:11:21.930
I can't do it.

198
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.126
I'm not that, and to get really,
really down on yourself.

199
00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:28.650
So you have a perfect knowledge
of your own shortcomings and

200
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.080
you have an imperfect understanding
of the accomplishments of others.

201
00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.445
Therefore, whenever you go to compare
yourself to others, you're going to be

202
00:11:35.445 --> 00:11:38.626
extremely critical of everything
because you know all of your downfalls.

203
00:11:38.626 --> 00:11:42.147
And you're going to be overly rosy and
optimistic about what someone else is

204
00:11:42.147 --> 00:11:46.120
doing because you just see them, you're
like, that person is amazing and I'm not.

205
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.518
Yeah, you will always
underestimate yourself and

206
00:11:50.518 --> 00:11:52.370
over-attribute progress to others.

207
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:57.454
So you're on a very personal
journey of learning to code,

208
00:11:57.454 --> 00:12:00.120
learning all these different skills.

209
00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.236
So just have a lot of patience for
yourself and

210
00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:05.310
know that you don't know how hard
it was for other people as well.

211
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:12.300
And kind of along those lines, don't play
the should game like, I should get this or

212
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.756
I should not be struggling like this,
should not have all these problems.

213
00:12:16.756 --> 00:12:19.162
There's no cosmic law of should, right?

214
00:12:19.162 --> 00:12:22.713
There's no one out there saying,
Brian, he should have got this by now.

215
00:12:22.713 --> 00:12:24.600
He's never gonna get it now, right?

216
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.366
So don't play the should game either.

217
00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:29.770
It's always a trap that new people
fall into that just discourages them.

218
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.930
The most comparable thing that I have ever
done to this is learn a foreign language.

219
00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:35.534
So I spent a couple years in Italy.

220
00:12:35.534 --> 00:12:39.510
I learned Italian, learned to read
Italian, learned to speak Italian.

221
00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.942
And believe me,
the first day I got to Italy,

222
00:12:41.942 --> 00:12:45.480
I really couldn't even order
a coffee at a coffee shop, right?

223
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.050
I could probably just point, I was like,
cafe, right, and that would be it.

224
00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:50.300
And except I probably would've
just said coffee, right,

225
00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.330
cuz I didn't know what the word for
cafe was, right?

226
00:12:55.464 --> 00:12:57.446
And it's just hard and
it's super discouraging and

227
00:12:57.446 --> 00:13:00.130
you just feel like you're
never gonna get it, right?

228
00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:02.116
You feel like it shouldn't be this hard.

229
00:13:02.116 --> 00:13:05.740
And I'll tell you that it took me months
before I can actually have a decent

230
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.609
conversation with someone or to order
at a restaurant or something like that.

231
00:13:09.609 --> 00:13:13.468
And it took me yet months longer to be
able to have a political discussion or

232
00:13:13.468 --> 00:13:15.410
something that has some depth to it.

233
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:20.259
And so this is kinda my point to you
is it's kinda the same muscles that you

234
00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:22.069
exercise when you're learning to code.

235
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:24.264
It really is learning to take
an idea in your head and

236
00:13:24.264 --> 00:13:25.859
express it in a different language.

237
00:13:25.859 --> 00:13:30.021
And in this case, we're expressing it in
JavaScript instead of expressing it in

238
00:13:30.021 --> 00:13:31.377
another foreign tongue.

239
00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:32.802
So this is just difficult.

240
00:13:32.802 --> 00:13:36.707
It's learning to rethink of
how you express yourself.

241
00:13:36.707 --> 00:13:41.093
So if you've ever learned too in Spanish
or French or Mandarin or something like

242
00:13:41.093 --> 00:13:44.898
that, this can feel comparable to that,
that it's just practice.

243
00:13:44.898 --> 00:13:47.882
Lots of practice, lots of work,
lots of not getting discouraged, and

244
00:13:47.882 --> 00:13:49.937
lots of pushing through
difficult situations.

245
00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:56.573
But I'm here to tell you that if
you do it, that you can, right?

246
00:13:56.573 --> 00:14:01.247
If you push through it, you can get
jobs to places like Microsoft and

247
00:14:01.247 --> 00:14:02.891
Netflix and LinkedIn.

248
00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:05.370
I did it, and I think you can, too.
