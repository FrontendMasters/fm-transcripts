1
00:00:00.381 --> 00:00:05.265
Wouldn't it be nice if you had this
big object here of me, all right?

2
00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:09.839
That has my name and
location, a street address.

3
00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.990
I definitely do live on 500
Fakes street in Seattle.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.184
If I could make a function on there
that would nicely print out the shipping

5
00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:20.479
address, all right?

6
00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:25.502
So that's what this getAddress
function will do for us, all right?

7
00:00:28.052 --> 00:00:30.785
Let's actually make this
a little just a tiny bit clearer.

8
00:00:33.448 --> 00:00:37.022
So first name, last name, all right?

9
00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:44.184
streetNumber, street, city,
state, zipCode, and country.

10
00:00:44.184 --> 00:00:51.027
This is obviously very US-centric,
but it's what I know.

11
00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:55.940
[LAUGH] I don't send too many
letters to Thailand, for example.

12
00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.464
So let's talk Ia second about,
I have this object, me, all right?

13
00:01:05.464 --> 00:01:08.876
And I'm trying to write a function that
pulls out information that exists on

14
00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:10.968
the object that it was created on,
all right?

15
00:01:10.968 --> 00:01:17.266
So I have this getAddress function so that
I can call me.getAddress here, all right?

16
00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:24.459
How do I refer to other parts of
the object, of the object that I'm on?

17
00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:25.090
This.

18
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.896
That's what this is right here.

19
00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:30.366
So I say this.name.first, all right?

20
00:01:32.815 --> 00:01:36.618
The this refers to me, all right?

21
00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:40.148
So it would be saying,
if I'm doing this.name.first,

22
00:01:40.148 --> 00:01:44.842
It would be like the same thing of here
as doing me.name.first, all right?

23
00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:50.619
So that's what this does is it refers to
the object that you're on at the moment.

24
00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:55.177
This is called context, all right?

25
00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:59.187
In this case,
it's relatively straightforward

26
00:01:59.187 --> 00:02:04.151
that this.name comes from
the same object that it's on, but

27
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:09.026
I'll tell you that it's very
easy to muddy the waters here.

28
00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:15.020
[LAUGH] I don't really wanna get into
the crazy depth of what how bent out

29
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.113
of shape you can make this,
but yeah, this is good, yeah.

30
00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:20.700
Question?

31
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.740
Yeah, are these classes
that you're creating and

32
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.998
then calling whenever you see the dots and
the colons?

33
00:02:26.998 --> 00:02:30.028
I guess The dots and the colons.

34
00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:32.016
Okay, so- Are you making a class?

35
00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:36.069
I don't know.

36
00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.939
You are on the right track for sure.

37
00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.985
We're in the same realm of information.

38
00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:46.051
So class is a really loaded word, and

39
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:49.062
it depends on which language
you're talking about.

40
00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:52.416
I'm assuming it's more of a Java context
that you're talking about classes with,

41
00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:53.271
but I could apply it.

42
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:55.227
I think JavaScript has classes.

43
00:02:55.227 --> 00:02:56.094
It does.

44
00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:56.881
You can do it.

45
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:59.065
Maybe I am thinking about Java, okay?

46
00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:00.974
So no, totally, okay?

47
00:03:00.974 --> 00:03:01.964
We'll demystify it a little bit,

48
00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:03.575
cuz I'm sure someone else is
wondering the same thing.

49
00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:05.991
It's a good question.

50
00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:10.769
I don't really wanna get
too much into classes, but

51
00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.926
you can say class Car, all right?

52
00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:17.342
And it can have a go function, all right?

53
00:03:17.342 --> 00:03:19.142
You're creating a type of object.

54
00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:20.578
It's like a blueprint for an object.

55
00:03:20.578 --> 00:03:24.574
If I wanted a car,
I would have to say const,

56
00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:28.904
I don't know,
civic = new Car( ) like this.

57
00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:32.792
And you have to use this new thing
here to get the actual civic.

58
00:03:32.792 --> 00:03:36.520
This would be a now an object
that has a go function on it.

59
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.109
Okay.

60
00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.754
Yeah.
On it, I think, yeah, I understand.

61
00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:43.622
So this civic that you would get would
end up being an object just like this

62
00:03:43.622 --> 00:03:44.341
one, all right?

63
00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:47.400
This one we're just directly creating
an object without creating a class in

64
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.937
between it.

65
00:03:47.937 --> 00:03:48.858
Okay.
Yeah,

66
00:03:48.858 --> 00:03:53.847
if all this was gibberish to that I just
said go and ignore it because JavaScript

67
00:03:53.847 --> 00:03:58.247
is not programmed like you program
Java and some of those other more.

68
00:03:58.247 --> 00:04:01.524
They're called object-oriented
programming models.

69
00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:03.913
You can and I'm imploring you to not.

70
00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:07.780
It's not a good way to write JavaScript.

71
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.469
I'm not saying that there's anything
wrong with doing that in Java or

72
00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.297
anything like that.

73
00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:14.309
It's just JavaScript is not built for

74
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:18.552
object oriented programming,
the way that Java is.

75
00:04:18.552 --> 00:04:21.925
So very similar to a class,
it's just an instance of the class or

76
00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:23.496
it's just an object, okay?

77
00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:29.452
Okay, back to this.

78
00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:33.366
Yeah, you can really
bend this out of shape,

79
00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:36.877
it becomes important of where you call.

80
00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:40.856
So here, I say me.getAddress,
so I'm calling it off of me,

81
00:04:40.856 --> 00:04:44.849
which means that this here ends
up being correct, all right?

82
00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:50.333
So you end up seeing here, I get
the correct address out here at the end.

83
00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:53.880
I just wanna show you how this can break.

84
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.531
If I say const func, let's just call it,
what do I call it here?

85
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:01.223
getAddress.

86
00:05:01.223 --> 00:05:09.442
PulledOut, getAddress = me.getAddress.

87
00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:12.624
So what I've done is I now have this
function here that I pulled out of it,

88
00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:13.152
all right?

89
00:05:13.152 --> 00:05:19.623
I pulled it out of the me function here,
all right?

90
00:05:19.623 --> 00:05:23.376
And now I think if I call

91
00:05:23.376 --> 00:05:30.887
console.log(pulledOutGetAddress) and

92
00:05:30.887 --> 00:05:33.460
I invoke that.

93
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.780
Undefined, undefined, undefined,
undefined, undefined,

94
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.437
undefined, all right?

95
00:05:39.437 --> 00:05:41.648
It's not bound to this me, all right?

96
00:05:41.648 --> 00:05:45.500
So when you call this here, it doesn't
know what you're looking for, all right?

97
00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.030
So it matters how you call the function.

98
00:05:50.483 --> 00:05:54.119
Super weird, I don't really
expect you to remember this, but

99
00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:57.080
I want you to know that
there are dangers with this.

100
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.313
Again, there are entire
courses on the topic.

101
00:05:59.313 --> 00:06:02.379
Definitely check out the JavaScript
learning path in front of masters.

102
00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.459
This will get into a lot of
depth of what context can be.

103
00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:09.458
And they love to ask junior
developers these questions when they

104
00:06:09.458 --> 00:06:10.726
do job interviews.

105
00:06:10.726 --> 00:06:14.735
So it's worth your time to invest in
figuring out how context works in a bunch

106
00:06:14.735 --> 00:06:15.935
of different lights.

107
00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:20.297
I could spend the next two hours explain
two ways to bend this and break this.

108
00:06:20.297 --> 00:06:23.513
I don't think that's beneficial
to you right now in your journey.

109
00:06:23.513 --> 00:06:27.900
So I just want you to know it's out there,
it exists, it can break.

110
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.302
But just know that it
matters how you call it.

111
00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:39.651
Yeah, I'm gonna hand wave away the rest
of this conversation because I

112
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.122
don't think it's useful for
us to get into a lot of depth here.

113
00:06:43.122 --> 00:06:48.957
Because it's either we go way deep in
this and spend another hour on it,

114
00:06:48.957 --> 00:06:53.739
or we keep going and
just accept that this is complicated.

115
00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:55.845
Is that okay?

116
00:06:55.845 --> 00:06:58.818
I don't think it's useful
to go any deeper than that.

117
00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:04.228
But you don't change the me.getAddress
to this get.Address, can it work then?

118
00:07:04.228 --> 00:07:07.626
Isn't that still calling me?

119
00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:09.406
If I say, down here.

120
00:07:09.406 --> 00:07:11.618
Or where you have the pulled out,

121
00:07:11.618 --> 00:07:14.787
getAddress where it says
me if you just do this.

122
00:07:14.787 --> 00:07:16.112
So good question.

123
00:07:16.112 --> 00:07:17.665
What is this here?

124
00:07:17.665 --> 00:07:19.341
What does this refer to?

125
00:07:19.341 --> 00:07:20.830
It's outside of the bracket.

126
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:21.831
Yeah.

127
00:07:21.831 --> 00:07:24.363
So question mark.

128
00:07:24.363 --> 00:07:25.775
It's probably window.

129
00:07:25.775 --> 00:07:27.206
I'm gonna guess.

130
00:07:27.206 --> 00:07:27.723
Yeah.

131
00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:34.880
Yeah.
Yeah, we can get rid of this.

132
00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.791
Object window.

133
00:07:40.791 --> 00:07:41.680
What is window?

134
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.129
Window is the overarching
context that everything runs in.

135
00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:48.289
So you can say.

136
00:07:55.637 --> 00:07:58.680
So for example,
when you call math like this,

137
00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.206
it's actually technically
calling window.math.

138
00:08:02.206 --> 00:08:03.754
Match math.

139
00:08:05.357 --> 00:08:10.858
So all those unprefixed globally available
objects are technically on window.

140
00:08:10.858 --> 00:08:14.973
It's just implied when
you don't put it there.

141
00:08:14.973 --> 00:08:15.905
So that's what this is, all right?

142
00:08:15.905 --> 00:08:19.033
If I say this here, it's window.

143
00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:20.708
Okay.

144
00:08:20.708 --> 00:08:23.212
So that's why it's called context.

145
00:08:23.212 --> 00:08:26.313
It's super contextual
about where you call this.

146
00:08:26.313 --> 00:08:29.246
And it's important that you know that
it's out there what this is because it's

147
00:08:29.246 --> 00:08:29.787
everywhere.

148
00:08:29.787 --> 00:08:32.173
You're definitely gonna see it in lots and
lots of places.

149
00:08:32.173 --> 00:08:35.495
But you need to be super
careful about what this is.

150
00:08:35.495 --> 00:08:41.175
So anytime that you see this,
I want you to stare at it as like,

151
00:08:41.175 --> 00:08:44.031
okay, what is this right now?

152
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:46.277
Well, I mean,
I made a really good point here.

153
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.045
This is running the same code twice, but

154
00:08:52.045 --> 00:08:55.989
this is different, and
it's the exact same code, but

155
00:08:55.989 --> 00:09:01.166
where it's called makes this different,
which is weird, all right?

156
00:09:03.752 --> 00:09:05.457
It just matters of where it's called.

157
00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:11.898
Yeah, cool.

158
00:09:11.898 --> 00:09:13.372
We'll leave it at that.

159
00:09:13.372 --> 00:09:15.471
You can actually fix this so
it actually pulled out.

160
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:17.010
It would work.

161
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.397
I hesitate to show you, but let's do it.

162
00:09:20.397 --> 00:09:22.963
.bind(me).

163
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.942
And this would have to be me.

164
00:09:32.906 --> 00:09:36.480
Because I call this .bind,
which is a function built onto functions,

165
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.924
which I understand sounds
a little strange, but

166
00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:41.385
functions have built-ins as well,
all right?

167
00:09:41.385 --> 00:09:45.848
By calling .bind on this, I am now
grafting these two together permanently,

168
00:09:45.848 --> 00:09:46.533
all right?

169
00:09:46.533 --> 00:09:50.182
So now whenever you call
pulled out getAddress,

170
00:09:50.182 --> 00:09:54.818
you're saying this is always
going to refer to the me object.

171
00:09:54.818 --> 00:09:58.275
And now it works, continually it's fine.

172
00:10:00.298 --> 00:10:01.925
That's what this bind thing does.

173
00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:13.428
There's other ways to fix it,
but we'll leave it at that.

174
00:10:13.428 --> 00:10:14.652
That's fine.
That works for now.

175
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:18.997
But yeah, that's what bind is for.

176
00:10:18.997 --> 00:10:21.449
Bind is for
changing the context of something.

177
00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:24.861
If you want to change what me is.

178
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:30.034
If you had something else where
you had a different object,

179
00:10:30.034 --> 00:10:34.908
you could absolutely use bind
to mess with what this is.

180
00:10:34.908 --> 00:10:37.856
At this point, you're in some meta-level
programming that I don't see.

181
00:10:37.856 --> 00:10:42.285
You're in a special hell that I do not
suggest you get yourself into, all right?

182
00:10:42.285 --> 00:10:46.901
For the most part, this can be avoided
by just not relying on this, and

183
00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:50.749
particularly on the changing
context of what this can be.

184
00:10:50.749 --> 00:10:53.025
This goes back to don't
write too clever of code.

185
00:10:55.714 --> 00:10:57.769
Just because you can,
doesn't mean you should.

186
00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:03.014
Okay, questions about that?

187
00:11:03.014 --> 00:11:06.034
Does that make sense?

188
00:11:06.034 --> 00:11:11.269
I've drawn a circle around this context
black box that if you wanna peek

189
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:16.254
into Pandora's box, again,
check out front of masters courses.

190
00:11:16.254 --> 00:11:19.678
I imagine it's probably one of
Kyle Simpson's courses that deals with

191
00:11:19.678 --> 00:11:20.654
context and depth.

192
00:11:22.652 --> 00:11:24.112
So definitely check that out.

193
00:11:24.112 --> 00:11:26.844
You'll get on if you're on
the JavaScript learning path.

194
00:11:30.427 --> 00:11:34.481
And again, if you're trying to go out and
interview for junior developer jobs,

195
00:11:34.481 --> 00:11:38.125
it's definitely one more study because
they love to ask that question.

196
00:11:42.247 --> 00:11:43.982
They'll do something like.

197
00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:49.036
What is this log right here?

198
00:11:49.036 --> 00:11:52.250
And they won't show you the results,
they'll just show you the code here and

199
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:53.595
what will you see if you do this?

200
00:11:53.595 --> 00:11:56.402
And you'll have to say, well,
it'll be a bunch of undefined.

201
00:11:56.402 --> 00:11:57.400
So, okay, how would you fix it?

202
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.291
Blah, blah, all stuff like that, okay?

203
00:12:05.424 --> 00:12:07.880
So this goes into what we
were talking about earlier.

204
00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.236
What is this outside of anything?

205
00:12:10.236 --> 00:12:12.435
It's this thing called window.

206
00:12:12.435 --> 00:12:15.834
Window is this overarching context
that everything executes in.

207
00:12:15.834 --> 00:12:18.634
If something doesn't have a context,
its context is window.

208
00:12:21.512 --> 00:12:28.112
So, for example, there's things onto
window, we saw math, we saw console.

209
00:12:28.112 --> 00:12:30.660
Console is built on the window as well.

210
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.357
So when I say, console.log, all right?

211
00:12:33.357 --> 00:12:39.222
You're actually saying window.console.log,
all right?

212
00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:46.594
Or there's scrollY.

213
00:12:46.594 --> 00:12:47.448
So right now,

214
00:12:47.448 --> 00:12:51.588
all these code snippets execute
immediately when you load the page.

215
00:12:51.588 --> 00:12:56.552
So if I change this, this will actually be
what my scroll position is on the page,

216
00:12:56.552 --> 00:12:59.485
how far I've scrolled
down in the Y direction.

217
00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:01.382
So if I scroll up and change it again.

218
00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:02.301
Notice that it changes.

219
00:13:02.301 --> 00:13:07.098
Or if I scroll down again, up.

220
00:13:07.098 --> 00:13:11.191
But if I don't scroll,
it just ends up being the same, all right?

221
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:12.435
There's lots of things on the window.

222
00:13:12.435 --> 00:13:14.708
There's also scrollX, see my direction.

223
00:13:14.708 --> 00:13:18.707
But as you probably imagine, I'm not
scrolled in any direction because this

224
00:13:18.707 --> 00:13:20.934
page doesn't let you scroll side to side.

225
00:13:28.145 --> 00:13:29.292
You could also do totally.

226
00:13:29.292 --> 00:13:30.324
I'm pretty sure.

227
00:13:30.324 --> 00:13:36.269
(scrolly) like this, so all of these
three things are exactly the same.

228
00:13:44.664 --> 00:13:47.044
Question about window.

229
00:13:47.044 --> 00:13:48.684
Only applies in the browser, by the way.

230
00:13:48.684 --> 00:13:52.113
If you ever start working in Node.js,
which is JavaScript on the back end.

231
00:13:52.113 --> 00:13:54.951
Whole course on that from
Scott Moss from front end masters.

232
00:13:54.951 --> 00:13:56.172
Window doesn't exist.

233
00:13:56.172 --> 00:13:59.810
For most of you taking this course,
you are focusing on front end development,

234
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.362
all right?

235
00:14:00.362 --> 00:14:03.726
Which means that you'll always
have window available, allright?

236
00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:05.815
But something to keep in
the back of your mind.

237
00:14:05.815 --> 00:14:09.490
Generally, a good rule of thumb is that
if you're inside of an object and you're

238
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:13.179
working on some sort of object, this will
be the object that you're working on.

239
00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:16.302
So a good example is like
the me object up here.

240
00:14:16.302 --> 00:14:20.542
This is gonna generally refer to
the object that I'm working on,

241
00:14:20.542 --> 00:14:24.100
which will be the me object
at this moment, all right?

242
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.828
So that's one thing.

243
00:14:26.828 --> 00:14:32.456
If you're working outside of that,
probably going to be window.

244
00:14:34.652 --> 00:14:38.572
Where it gets really dicey is where you're
invoking functions that you've pulled

245
00:14:38.572 --> 00:14:40.652
out of other objects, or things like that.

246
00:14:40.652 --> 00:14:45.796
That Make the context change unexpectedly
would be a good way of putting that.

247
00:14:48.664 --> 00:14:49.245
Makes sense?

248
00:14:52.466 --> 00:14:53.480
Cool.

249
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.907
I think I've given you enough context for
you to be aware of what this is.

250
00:14:56.907 --> 00:15:00.227
For the most part,
you don't really need to use it too much.

251
00:15:00.227 --> 00:15:04.222
But I do want to introduce it to
because you'll see it in code samples.

252
00:15:04.222 --> 00:15:08.347
Or if you start writing things like React,
which is like a framework for

253
00:15:08.347 --> 00:15:11.785
JavaScript, it'll use this in places and
you'll see it,

254
00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:15.871
so I just want you to be aware of what
it is and how to learn more about it.

255
00:15:15.871 --> 00:15:19.638
And I left a link here to one
of Kyle's Simpsons courses,

256
00:15:19.638 --> 00:15:21.922
where he talks more in depth on it.
