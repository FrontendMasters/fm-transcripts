1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.880
So this is cool.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.980
Now we have a bit of JavaScript that
we can execute directly from here.

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.480
So now we can start using all of
the power of visual studio code here,

4
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.191
but this is how you include JavaScript
into your HTML and CSS project.

5
00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:26.663
You might ask me, why doesn't this go
on the head or why is this where it is?

6
00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:30.213
Right, whereas like something like
your CSS, right, would go here.

7
00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:36.995
Right, if we had a stylesheet,
if you wanted one there.

8
00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:43.816
So this goes in the head because
before people see your content,

9
00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:48.291
you don't want them to see
unstyled HTML and then for

10
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:53.288
it to flash, and
then it turned into styled code, right?

11
00:00:53.288 --> 00:00:57.785
It's called a FOUC,
flash of unstyled content, FOUC, yeah,

12
00:00:57.785 --> 00:01:00.660
flash of unstyled content.

13
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.032
You don't want that, right,
because it's annoying to people, right?

14
00:01:04.032 --> 00:01:06.865
Imagine if you went to netflix.com,
everything was black and white and

15
00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:10.250
all sudden all of the images and fonts and
all that stuff showed up immediately.

16
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.460
It's startling to people.

17
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.820
They don't expect that.

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.241
That's why you load your CSS first here in
the head before it loads anything else.

19
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:23.600
Then you wanna load all of your HTML so
people can see things.

20
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.506
And then the last thing that you load is
the JavaScript, because you want people to

21
00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:30.449
see things while they're making
a decision about what to do,

22
00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:33.330
you wanna load the JavaScript
in the background.

23
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.810
That's kind of the process, right?

24
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.094
This is a game of psychology of making
people think that your website is fast.

25
00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:44.275
Because typically it takes people,
I don't know,

26
00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:48.460
hundreds of milliseconds if not
seconds to see your website, read it,

27
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.850
understand it, and make a decision
of what they wanna do next.

28
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.450
So in the time that it takes for someone
to do that, you can load your JavaScript

29
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.880
in the background, so
everything becomes interactive.

30
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.723
So that's why we love
JavaScript at the end.

31
00:02:05.723 --> 00:02:09.818
Cuz your browser when it gets this HTML
document, it just reads it line by line.

32
00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:11.507
and it just executes things line by line.

33
00:02:11.507 --> 00:02:17.134
So once it hits this linkstyle.css,
it actually pauses loading your HTML,

34
00:02:17.134 --> 00:02:22.693
downloads all of your style sheets,
applies those, and then keeps going.

35
00:02:22.693 --> 00:02:26.324
Then when it hits this script tag,
it's going to stop,

36
00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:31.527
download your script tag, execute all
that JavaScript, and then keep going.

37
00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:33.401
So it doesn't literally line by line.

38
00:02:36.652 --> 00:02:37.914
Any questions about that?

39
00:02:39.662 --> 00:02:42.782
Sometimes people find that confusing
of why you do it in certain order,

40
00:02:42.782 --> 00:02:43.411
that's why.

41
00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:52.483
Someone might ask me if, well, sometimes
you do put it in the head, sometimes.

42
00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:56.637
So for example, Google Analytics wants
to be loaded in the head, right,

43
00:02:56.637 --> 00:03:01.059
because it wants to run off, your person
got visited and they hit these pages,

44
00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:05.221
right, you can have like analytics of
how people are using your website.

45
00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:08.699
Sometimes they want you to put them in the
head, I still don't listen to them cuz I

46
00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:11.684
want my website to load fast, and
if I lose some analytics, so be it.

47
00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:15.062
But that's a personal preference.

48
00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:17.583
I always try to do what's best for
the user.

49
00:03:17.583 --> 00:03:21.799
Yeah, let's go ahead and
put our equation in here just for funsies,

50
00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.799
such as you can just copy this code
here that we wrote and paste that

51
00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.255
into our experiments, and get rid of
our link there cuz we have no style.

52
00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.740
Now, what do we expect
when we refresh the page?

53
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.596
What is it going to log out,
if we go back to our page and refresh it?

54
00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:44.173
&gt;&gt; That number whatever
the something times 12 is.

55
00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:45.915
&gt;&gt; That's absolutely correct.

56
00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:48.486
So it's going to be the 6000, right?

57
00:03:48.486 --> 00:03:51.575
The yearly rent in our particular case.

58
00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:54.711
That's a really useful exercise
to do every time that you go and

59
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:57.149
refresh the page,
is what do I expect to happen?

60
00:03:57.149 --> 00:04:02.340
So that one, you're kind of thinking
through everything that you just did.

61
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.639
And then see if it matches
your expectations, but

62
00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.720
kind of like running
the code in your head.

63
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.362
I found that to be a really
useful exercise for myself.

64
00:04:11.852 --> 00:04:14.460
By the way, so
if I go here and change this,

65
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.077
or let's say if changes need to be 600.

66
00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:21.465
First if I wanna see it reflected in the
browser, if one, I have to once save it.

67
00:04:21.465 --> 00:04:24.140
So I hit command S here.

68
00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.770
You can see every time that I change
something here in VS code, it's a circle,

69
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.045
when it's unsaved.

70
00:04:30.045 --> 00:04:35.250
And then if I hit command S, or you can
just say File Save up here as well.

71
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.772
I'm very lazy, so I just do Command S, or

72
00:04:38.772 --> 00:04:43.212
I'm pretty sure it's ctrl S,
right, in Windows.

73
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.760
Then I have to come over here,
notice this is still 6000.

74
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.570
I have to refresh the page, which you
can do by this little arrow here.

75
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.120
Or command R in Mac or
I believe it's just F5 in Windows.

76
00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.168
Also I think F5 works in Mac,
surprisingly enough.

77
00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.951
Yeah, it does.

78
00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:05.761
So you can you can use F5 in both, but

79
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:09.224
Command R is more what
most people use in Mac.

80
00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:17.232
I had to learn so
many shortcuts in both Windows and

81
00:05:17.232 --> 00:05:21.035
Mac, one, cuz I used to work in
Microsoft and I had to do it on Windows,

82
00:05:21.035 --> 00:05:25.503
but to teaching all these classes people
wanna know the shortcuts in both of them.

83
00:05:27.002 --> 00:05:30.633
Okay, so that's why sometimes
people don't see this reflected,

84
00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:34.277
they expect it to change right away but
you have to refresh the page.

85
00:05:36.796 --> 00:05:37.830
Okay.

86
00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:43.329
So congrats,
you just wrote your first code.

87
00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:44.857
I didn't have you write hello world.

88
00:05:44.857 --> 00:05:50.219
Typically people write hello world for
their first application.

89
00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:55.600
If you wanna write it, it's just
console.log, Hello world, like that.

90
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.021
Why hello world?

91
00:05:57.021 --> 00:06:00.935
It's just like it's a meme at this point
I suppose for computer scientists that,

92
00:06:00.935 --> 00:06:04.350
it's the most basic program that one
can write is hello world, right?

93
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.635
So now if I say this and
refresh this over here,

94
00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:10.640
what would you expect
to see an X down here?

95
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.428
We're gonna see both, right,
cuz I didn't take this one out.

96
00:06:16.435 --> 00:06:21.102
So if I refresh I see 72 under first and
then I see hello world.

97
00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:26.669
Nice sort of feature though is I can
click here on experiments.js, so

98
00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.945
this is experiment.js line 4,
I think column 9.

99
00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:34.904
If I click on that, it'll actually
take me to where it came from and

100
00:06:34.904 --> 00:06:36.687
a bunch of other stuff.

101
00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:37.442
You actually,

102
00:06:37.442 --> 00:06:41.110
I think you have to give this permissions
to access your local file system.

103
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.863
But this can be really helpful
if you're wondering like,

104
00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:46.460
where did this come from, right?

105
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.299
Well, now I know I can go
look at experiments.js and

106
00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:52.350
I can go look at line 7, right?

107
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.380
That's correct,
line 7 is where that came from.

108
00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.240
And then technically this is column nine.

109
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.350
Yeah, you can see there,
line seven dot column nine.

110
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:07.104
So this is the function that I called,
which is where the nine comes from.
