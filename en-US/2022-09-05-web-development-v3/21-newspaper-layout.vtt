00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.340
So so far, I've shown you a lot of
various different techniques and

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.140
things to do with CSS.

3
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.356
By the way, we're essentially done
learning new stuff about CSS and

4
00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:11.310
I'm gonna make you do some projects now.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.438
But you have a pretty good grasp on
the realm of everything that's in CSS.

6
00:00:16.438 --> 00:00:19.172
There's not a lot more that exists.

7
00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:22.970
I mean,
there's even more advanced animations.

8
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.606
There's different ways of doing
layouts and things like that, but

9
00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:29.937
you know most of the surface area
of what CSS can do for you now.

10
00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:36.589
So you and
I are going to build this together.

11
00:00:38.077 --> 00:00:42.054
This newspaper looking article together.

12
00:00:44.708 --> 00:00:46.869
There's many ways of doing this correctly.

13
00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:54.523
Let's talk about how, How I would do this.

14
00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:58.626
So this is the whole page here.

15
00:01:00.988 --> 00:01:03.972
It's got a navigation bar up here.

16
00:01:03.972 --> 00:01:06.879
This has got a title here.

17
00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:11.650
It's got nice little borders,
it's got an image, it's got text on it.

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.470
So let's take a look at what
the HTML would look like.

19
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.409
It's got a page.

20
00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.790
It's got a brand header on it.

21
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.282
So as you might imagine, actually,
let's just do it this way, oops.

22
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:37.074
This is a header here, right?

23
00:01:37.074 --> 00:01:40.277
Inside of that header, there's an h1.

24
00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:45.503
That yellow that you see there, that's
a margin, so that's got some margin on it.

25
00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:50.730
All the navigation is
getting pushed together.

26
00:01:57.856 --> 00:02:00.924
Okay, it's got a ul,
an unordered list, right?

27
00:02:00.924 --> 00:02:04.172
That's kinda what I used to
put the navigation links.

28
00:02:04.172 --> 00:02:08.139
So you can see all of these
here exist as li's on here.

29
00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.795
And inside of them is each an anchor
tag to go to various different places.

30
00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:14.054
So this would go to the sports page or
the opinion.

31
00:02:14.054 --> 00:02:16.912
I didn't make them go anywhere cuz I
didn't code the rest of the website.

32
00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:20.097
But as you might imagine, this would link
off different parts of your website.

33
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:28.758
Okay, and then I have articles, right?

34
00:02:28.758 --> 00:02:33.705
This is an article,
this is an article, that's an article.

35
00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:40.258
And then down here, Is an article and
a wider article, right?

36
00:02:43.488 --> 00:02:44.497
That's it.

37
00:02:47.608 --> 00:02:53.734
So my question for
you is how would you do this?

38
00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:57.466
Well, what techniques
would you use to do this?

39
00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:01.533
Well, this one's pretty easy.

40
00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:03.437
You just have an h1 that
takes the entire page.

41
00:03:03.437 --> 00:03:07.881
And then you could text align
that to the center, and

42
00:03:07.881 --> 00:03:13.420
then you would set the, And let's just
go through with all this together.

43
00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:25.448
So, This is all of my CSS that I wrote for
it.

44
00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:35.236
But if we inspect element here,
It's got a font-family.

45
00:03:35.236 --> 00:03:39.840
Snell Roundhand was the name
of the font of this, classic,

46
00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.076
just looked at for a cursive looking one.

47
00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:47.525
Font-size, no,
I didn't want it to be bolded, right?

48
00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:49.464
Otherwise, it'd be bold,
and that looks weird to me.

49
00:03:49.464 --> 00:03:54.492
60 pixels, and
then text-align center, pretty easy.

50
00:03:54.492 --> 00:03:56.942
ul here, how would you do this?

51
00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:58.361
You could do with grid.

52
00:03:58.361 --> 00:04:00.832
You could do with flex,
I did it with flex.

53
00:04:00.832 --> 00:04:03.890
Space around that fit in nicely.

54
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.406
Align-items center cuz I wanted everything
to be horizontal and vertically centered.

55
00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:14.821
So I did align-items center,
justify-content space-around, right?

56
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.699
If you take the list-style off, otherwise,
there's the little bullets show up.

57
00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.594
We didn't want bullets.

58
00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:23.251
Margin 0, otherwise, it had a margin or
anything, and we don't want that.

59
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:27.126
We want the nice little lines
to connect to each other.

60
00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:30.236
And then padding of 30 pixels, otherwise,
it just gets pushed up on that, and

61
00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.223
I wanted some space to give
everything to breathe.

62
00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.055
Okay, the li's,
let's look at one of those.

63
00:04:43.641 --> 00:04:47.369
That, I got rid of the text-decoration,
otherwise, they're underlined.

64
00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:50.502
You might argue that might be better,
up to you.

65
00:04:50.502 --> 00:04:54.096
font-size, font-weight, I mean, arguably,

66
00:04:54.096 --> 00:04:57.782
that actually looks better,
but I didn't do that.

67
00:04:57.782 --> 00:05:02.529
Font-family Futura,
otherwise, I don't like that.

68
00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.797
And I grayed it out a little bit,
otherwise, it's really bold and black and

69
00:05:05.797 --> 00:05:06.827
pulls your attention.

70
00:05:12.093 --> 00:05:12.845
Okay?

71
00:05:15.589 --> 00:05:20.209
So I'm kinda showing you this because I'm
going to make you do this here in just

72
00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.843
a second.

73
00:05:20.843 --> 00:05:23.015
Okay, then we have all the various
different articles here.

74
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:28.691
But let's look at the page here,

75
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:33.200
because this is laid out in grid, right?

76
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.481
So if you actually look at
the string here that I used,

77
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:40.740
it's header header header, right?

78
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.491
So header header header
there across the top.

79
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:49.644
Nav nav nav, right, so nav nav nav, right?

80
00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:52.017
story-1 story-2 story-3, so

81
00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:56.229
story-1 story-2 story-3,
that worked out well, right?

82
00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.427
And then down here is
story-4 story-5 story-5.

83
00:06:00.427 --> 00:06:06.226
Right, cuz story-5 takes up two of
the rows or two of the cells, right?

84
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.478
And then, I mean,

85
00:06:10.478 --> 00:06:16.271
these articles are really just an h2
probably I think is what I put in there.

86
00:06:17.764 --> 00:06:23.001
With a couple of paragraphs, font-size,
text-align center, font-weight normal.

87
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:27.410
And then I put an italic on there to
kind of give it the news impression.

88
00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:30.521
And that's it.

89
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:35.229
That is how you lay out all this.

90
00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.032
I showed you all
the techniques to do that.

91
00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:39.110
You totally could do this yourself.

92
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.404
And if you want to, it's a good exercise
to go back and maybe try it for yourself,

93
00:06:42.404 --> 00:06:43.240
see if you can do it.
