00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.140
You'll spend a lot of
time looping over arrays.

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.700
It's a really common thing that
you have a group of things, and

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.640
you wanna do something to each
item in the array, right?

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.872
So, I have these cities here.

5
00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:15.550
And let's say I just wanna log them out,
right?

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.850
Method one, this is one that you should
probably remember that I would say this

7
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.250
one is more useful in my opinion.

8
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.033
You do a for loop,
I is less than cities dot length, right,

9
00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.642
cuz length will be like, what is this one?

10
00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:31.056
This is of length five.

11
00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:33.771
You'll go from zero to four.

12
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:37.570
Once you hit five,
five is out of bounds, right?

13
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.399
If you ask for the fifth element in this,
it's undefined, right?

14
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.564
Sorry, if you ask for the five index,

15
00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:50.454
the fifth one is there because
the fifth one would be Hong Kong, but

16
00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:55.275
the five index would be here,
right, which is undefined there.

17
00:00:57.076 --> 00:01:00.830
Okay, so that's what this is doing here.

18
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.480
I ++, and then you let's just
say console dot log cities.

19
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.154
And then instead of putting,
like a number here like zero, or one, or

20
00:01:09.154 --> 00:01:11.400
two, or three, right?

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.159
You put I because what is I
doing every singe literation?

22
00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.130
Keeps going up one, right?

23
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.078
So you can see here he goes from Seattle,
San Francisco,

24
00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:26.880
Salt Lake City, Amsterdam, Hong Kong.

25
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.242
Just as I demonstrate, if I just put it
there you can see those are the numbers.

26
00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:42.180
Well, this is probably even more useful,

27
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.693
0 Seattle, 1 San Francisco,

28
00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:51.042
2 Salt Lake City,
3 Amsterdam, 4 Hong Kong.

29
00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:53.781
I probably didn't show you
this before with console.log,

30
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:56.787
you can just keep giving it stuff
if you just separate it by commas,

31
00:01:56.787 --> 00:02:00.130
it'll log everything that you give it out,
right?

32
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.505
So I could just put lol here,
and it would log that out too.

33
00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:13.480
Does that make sense?

34
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.131
Feeling good about that?

35
00:02:16.376 --> 00:02:18.674
This is really, really, really common.

36
00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:25.370
Okay, I wanted to show you this one cuz
you'll see it and it might seem confusing.

37
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.742
There's a function,
like a built into arrays called for

38
00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:32.392
each, which takes in a function.

39
00:02:35.064 --> 00:02:36.811
Maybe this is a bit more clear.

40
00:02:39.272 --> 00:02:41.934
Function logcity.

41
00:02:54.013 --> 00:02:57.660
So this is just like we're passing
in a variable here, right?

42
00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.135
And it's running this function once on
every single item in the array, and

43
00:03:02.135 --> 00:03:05.061
it's passing that city in as that item,
right?

44
00:03:05.061 --> 00:03:09.220
So we have Seattle, San Francisco,
Salt Lake City, Amsterdam, right?

45
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.393
So, how many times is this
function being called?

46
00:03:16.393 --> 00:03:18.590
Five times, right?

47
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.637
It gets called for one time for
every single item in the array.

48
00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:36.756
Okay, and I will just say,
timesCalled = a ++, right?

49
00:03:41.946 --> 00:03:43.833
Same thing.

50
00:03:47.087 --> 00:03:49.236
So, calls it that many times.

51
00:03:51.314 --> 00:03:53.960
This is called a more like more
functional style of programming,

52
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.232
if you've ever heard of like
functional programming.

53
00:03:56.232 --> 00:04:00.030
This is kind of the idea where you pass
functions into other functions, and

54
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.248
they do things for you.

55
00:04:01.248 --> 00:04:04.206
I don't really want you to worry
too much about this now, but

56
00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:07.512
I wanted you to see because you're
going to see it in code examples.

57
00:04:10.898 --> 00:04:14.961
So, here I've pulled this function out and
then I pass this function into here,

58
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:18.035
frequently you'll just see
people put this directly here.

59
00:04:19.765 --> 00:04:26.274
Like this, and the same for each item
in the array, call this function once.

60
00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:31.242
Good, feeling okay about that?

61
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.310
Some people prefer this style,
some people for other style.

62
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.731
I'm gonna argue that I think this
is the more useful way of doing it.

63
00:04:42.368 --> 00:04:44.017
For a myriad of reasons.

64
00:04:45.693 --> 00:04:48.727
But up to you.

65
00:04:48.727 --> 00:04:51.532
There's some people that would
strongly disagree with that.

66
00:04:51.532 --> 00:04:55.978
This is kind of the end
of basic programming,

67
00:04:55.978 --> 00:05:00.893
congratulations you've
now gone through a lot,

68
00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:04.527
you've gone through the firehose.

69
00:05:04.527 --> 00:05:08.476
I'm not gonna teach you any more new
programming techniques, not that there

70
00:05:08.476 --> 00:05:12.485
aren't any more out there in javascript or
other programming languages, but

71
00:05:12.485 --> 00:05:16.500
you have the basic grammar to go out and
do a lot of really interesting things.

72
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.378
If this was like a foreign language class,
it would be like,

73
00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:24.800
you've completed like the first
year of your French class, right?

74
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.201
And you can go out there and
order a croissant at a bakery or

75
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.160
something like that.
