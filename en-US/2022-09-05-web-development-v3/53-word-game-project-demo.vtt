WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.483
We are gonna do our next project together.

2
00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:07.182
This is the final project, so
congratulations on making this far.

3
00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:14.606
Many of you are probably familiar
with the word game Wordle,

4
00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:19.444
right, written by my former
coworker Josh Wordle from Reddit.

5
00:00:19.444 --> 00:00:24.250
It's a word game that you and I will just
play it together quickly to show you kind

6
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.719
of like how it works if you're
not familiar with Wordle.

7
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:33.083
I call it Word Masters here or
Frontend Masters, right, make sense.

8
00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:37.342
So people have one, two, three, four,

9
00:00:37.342 --> 00:00:42.102
five, guesses to try and
guess what a word is.

10
00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:47.417
So what they can do here is
they can guess, Some word,

11
00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:52.256
I pick CRANE cuz apparently that's
what everyone picks, right?

12
00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:56.322
And then it'll tell you C, A, N and

13
00:00:56.322 --> 00:01:01.879
E are nowhere in that word,
and R is in that word,

14
00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.102
but it is in the wrong place, right?

15
00:01:06.102 --> 00:01:08.509
So, let's guess something else.

16
00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.130
The next thing I always guess is TOILS.

17
00:01:13.724 --> 00:01:18.414
So I know for a fact there is an I,
and O, and an R,

18
00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:21.626
and they're in the wrong place.

19
00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:29.296
I actually know what the word is but
if it's in the correct place, Let's see.

20
00:01:29.296 --> 00:01:34.477
Well, if you could guess
the correct word which

21
00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:39.280
today it is IVORY, it'll tell you you win.

22
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.014
And then I put a little animation
there at the end where it flashes all

23
00:01:44.014 --> 00:01:47.181
the rainbow that to let
you know that you won.

24
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:50.141
But if it's in the correct place,
then it will turn green.

25
00:01:54.207 --> 00:01:56.746
Last, so
I'm gonna just refresh the page here.

26
00:01:56.746 --> 00:01:59.823
It's the same word, so if I put IVORY
again, you'll just win right away.

27
00:02:01.945 --> 00:02:05.985
But if I put gibberish in here,
notice that it'll just flash red,

28
00:02:05.985 --> 00:02:10.402
to show me that you're trying to get
something that's actually worse.

29
00:02:10.402 --> 00:02:12.573
All the guesses must be valid words.

30
00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.658
Yeah, that is it, that's the entire
game of how to play Wordle.

31
00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:27.612
So this is what you
are going to code yourself.

32
00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:32.186
Now, what I find compelling about this is
you just took an intro to web development

33
00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:36.096
course, and you're going to be coding
an application that got sold to

34
00:02:36.096 --> 00:02:39.302
the New York Times for
several million dollars, right?

35
00:02:39.302 --> 00:02:43.654
Which is to say, the skills that you
have acquired here could potentially be

36
00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.243
worth several millions of dollars, right?

37
00:02:46.243 --> 00:02:50.943
Josh has had a really good idea and
he executed on it really well, and

38
00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:53.755
that was worth a lot of money to someone.

39
00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:56.646
So you can take your ideas,
you can make apps out of them, and

40
00:02:56.646 --> 00:02:58.196
then maybe sell them to people.

41
00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:01.107
So one thing my demo doesn't
work on mobile phones.

42
00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:03.725
You get extra bonus points if you do.

43
00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:08.109
I did make it work on mobile phones but
it made it so much more complicated in

44
00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.870
the code that I just decided, we're not
gonna worry about that for the moment.

45
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.923
So, I've the kind of the plan here.

46
00:03:16.923 --> 00:03:22.085
There's a secret five-letter word chosen,
right?

47
00:03:22.085 --> 00:03:23.845
I have an API setup for you, so

48
00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:27.590
that it will give you a new word
everyday just like with Wordle.

49
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.313
Wordle, there's only one word
every single day, right, and

50
00:03:31.313 --> 00:03:33.641
then it changes everyday at midnight.

51
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:38.265
Players have six guesses
to get this secret word.

52
00:03:38.265 --> 00:03:44.170
So if I just say CRANE, CRANE, CRANE,

53
00:03:50.406 --> 00:03:54.781
So it'll tell you that you lose,
the word was IVORY.

54
00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:57.492
Right, so it'll tell you at the end,
I'm just using alerts.

55
00:03:57.492 --> 00:04:01.923
Alerts are objectively terrible user
experiences, but I didn't wanna spend

56
00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:05.762
a bunch of times coding up some sort
of a nice looking losing screen.

57
00:04:05.762 --> 00:04:10.331
But you could totally do that, right,
you can have something better than alerts.

58
00:04:11.865 --> 00:04:17.427
So if a player gets his letter that's
in the correct place, show it as green.

59
00:04:17.427 --> 00:04:19.436
So let's just refresh this again.

60
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.749
What's a word that would have
something that would match, but

61
00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:29.492
not be the correct thing.

62
00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:32.191
English is not my strong
suit all the time.

63
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:40.560
Anyway, it would just show
that as green here, right?

64
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.007
And obviously if you do IVORY.

65
00:04:44.487 --> 00:04:46.002
It shows them all in green, right?

66
00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:54.204
Okay, so a good example,
if the player gets a SPOOL and

67
00:04:54.204 --> 00:05:01.362
the word is OVERT, right, one of the Os
will be shown here as green, right?

68
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:06.846
Actually, one's gonna be shown as yellow.

69
00:05:06.846 --> 00:05:11.451
But yeah, if a player guesses
the correct letter in the correct place,

70
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:13.072
it'll be green, okay?

71
00:05:13.072 --> 00:05:17.079
Another thing that ends
up being a little bit

72
00:05:17.079 --> 00:05:21.745
difficult is that what happens if,
here, right?

73
00:05:21.745 --> 00:05:26.743
So OVERT it has one O,
if that's the correct word, and

74
00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:30.343
you have SPOOL here, which has two Os.

75
00:05:30.343 --> 00:05:34.152
You shouldn't show both Os as yellow,
right,

76
00:05:34.152 --> 00:05:39.212
because there is one yellow in the word,
but there's not two.

77
00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:42.700
So the first one should be shown as
yellow but the second one shouldn't be.

78
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.659
But let's say the word is,
I don't know, POOL or

79
00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.398
something like that,
word actually does have two Os, right?

80
00:05:49.398 --> 00:05:53.317
Then you need to make sure that
the correct number of letters are showing

81
00:05:53.317 --> 00:05:54.768
as yellow and/or green.

82
00:05:57.431 --> 00:06:01.802
So if this was POOLS and
the correct word was SPOOL,

83
00:06:01.802 --> 00:06:07.811
then one of them would be green and
one of them would be yellow, right?

84
00:06:07.811 --> 00:06:13.441
Because the first O would be in
the correct place, but the one,

85
00:06:13.441 --> 00:06:19.829
this O, would be correct that's in
the word but not in the right place.

86
00:06:22.485 --> 00:06:25.702
Okay, the player guesses the right word,
then the game is over and

87
00:06:25.702 --> 00:06:27.319
you do some sort of celebration.

88
00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.578
Again, I just use that same rainbow
animation that I showed you in the CSS

89
00:06:30.578 --> 00:06:31.549
animation chapter.

90
00:06:38.356 --> 00:06:41.152
I try to think if there's
anything else interesting to say.

91
00:06:41.152 --> 00:06:43.350
Notice that I have a loading indicator,
right?

92
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.815
So if you catch it right
when I refresh the page,

93
00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:47.797
there's like a little spinny thing.

94
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.840
There's a green one,
it took me a second to think about one.

95
00:06:56.301 --> 00:06:58.354
Right, but
you see that little spinny guide,

96
00:06:58.354 --> 00:07:01.893
it's requesting something from the API and
then now you're waiting, right?

97
00:07:01.893 --> 00:07:03.741
It's a loading indicator, right?

98
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:08.929
Cuz there's some delay between when you
make the call and when the call comes

99
00:07:08.929 --> 00:07:13.973
back, you don't want the user to think
that the thing is broken, right?

100
00:07:13.973 --> 00:07:18.529
I'm on a very fast Internet connection at
the moment, so it's basically instant.

101
00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:23.327
But imagine that user is on a 2G
connection in the middle of rural Montana

102
00:07:23.327 --> 00:07:25.540
or something like that, right?

103
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:29.824
That can take a long time, so they might
be waiting a half second, a full second,

104
00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:30.837
several seconds.

105
00:07:30.837 --> 00:07:36.631
So the spinning indicator just lets us
know, chill out, I'm working on it, right?

106
00:07:36.631 --> 00:07:39.292
That's why you wanna show
like a loading indicator.

107
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:43.891
Okay, So

108
00:07:43.891 --> 00:07:49.029
you will need to call an API to
get the correct secret word.

109
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:52.239
Frontend Masters has created one for
you, so

110
00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:57.404
that you can call their API and they
will give you back the word of the day.

111
00:07:57.404 --> 00:08:00.548
So you have two APIs to work with.

112
00:08:00.548 --> 00:08:03.709
One of them is this one here,
I'll give you the URL.

113
00:08:03.709 --> 00:08:08.920
If you get to it,
You'll see here that you get IVORY.

114
00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:15.455
And then at midnight tonight this
will change to be something else.

115
00:08:15.455 --> 00:08:19.313
So by the time if you're watching
this later, it will not be IVORY,

116
00:08:19.313 --> 00:08:20.879
it'll be something else.

117
00:08:26.143 --> 00:08:30.859
Okay, The response will look like this,
will have a word.

118
00:08:30.859 --> 00:08:32.435
It'll be some five-letter word,

119
00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:35.019
I guarantee you that all of
these are five-letter words.

120
00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:38.523
And you can ignore the puzzle number,
right, but

121
00:08:38.523 --> 00:08:42.289
we just looked at puzzle number,
what was it, 53?

122
00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:46.195
Tomorrow it will be Puzzle number 54 and
then 55, it just increments.

123
00:08:48.135 --> 00:08:52.403
And then these are, if you just wanna have
some fun, like if you wanna keep guessing,

124
00:08:52.403 --> 00:08:54.140
you can add random=1 to the end.

125
00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.511
So if we do this, let me say random=1.

126
00:09:02.097 --> 00:09:04.786
This was just me while I was testing cuz I
actually wanted to play the game, right?

127
00:09:04.786 --> 00:09:06.967
Once you know the word of the day,
you have to wait a whole day, and

128
00:09:06.967 --> 00:09:08.089
I didn't wanna wait a whole day.

129
00:09:08.089 --> 00:09:13.140
But if you put random it'll just keep
giving you random words here, right?

130
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.122
Again, always five-letter words.

131
00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:21.319
And there's several
thousands five-letter words.

132
00:09:21.319 --> 00:09:26.335
The one disclaimer that I'm gonna throw
out right now, we did our best to clean

133
00:09:26.335 --> 00:09:31.582
it of words that might be undesirable but
it is a random word list of words, right?

134
00:09:31.582 --> 00:09:35.589
So, nothing isn't meant by any intent for
all these words, they're just,

135
00:09:35.589 --> 00:09:39.241
I promise you, they're literally
just random five-letter words.

136
00:09:39.241 --> 00:09:42.597
So, I'm sorry if you come across
one that's disagreeable to you.

137
00:09:42.597 --> 00:09:44.151
I promise you, we don't mean anything.

138
00:09:50.722 --> 00:09:56.254
And if you wanna request a specific word,
you can also say, what I call it, puzzle.

139
00:09:56.254 --> 00:10:02.765
So you can put ?puzzle=1, if you wanna
see what the very first one was.

140
00:10:02.765 --> 00:10:05.032
So it was cigar, right?

141
00:10:05.032 --> 00:10:11.981
Fixer, right, 140, Okay,

142
00:10:11.981 --> 00:10:17.201
so that is the word of the day.
