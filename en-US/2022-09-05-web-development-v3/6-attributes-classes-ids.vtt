1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.782
So let's talk about attributes for
a moment.

2
00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:08.292
You have all these various different tags,
but these tags can have multiple different

3
00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:11.839
capabilities built into them, and we saw
that with the inputs specifically, right?

4
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.951
Either type = text, the type = color,
number, all those different things.

5
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.790
This is all just an input tag, right?

6
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.427
But we can modify the behavior of
this particular input tag to be

7
00:00:24.427 --> 00:00:27.150
a specific type of an input, right?

8
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.910
This right here, where we're modifying
what this is, is called an attribute.

9
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.225
So the type of tag will always
be the very, very first thing,

10
00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.370
100% of time it always must
be the very first thing.

11
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.187
So this will always say input here
if it's gonna be an input tag, and

12
00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:52.099
then you can have a bunch of different
things of key = value, right?

13
00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:56.500
So, I'll just do this
to demonstrate to you.

14
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.490
You'll call this part of it the key,
and you'll call this part the value.

15
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.440
Makes sense?

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.264
That's just terminology so

17
00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:06.091
you make sure that we're all
speaking the same language here.

18
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.284
So the key will always be what kind
of attribute it's gonna be and

19
00:01:13.284 --> 00:01:17.593
the value is going to be what we're
setting that attribute to be.

20
00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:21.188
So we're setting the type = text.

21
00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:26.981
And then you can see it changes what
kind of input that we end up with.

22
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:28.910
And that's really about it.

23
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.096
So what kind of tag it is will determine
what kind of attributes that could have,

24
00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:36.120
right?

25
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.080
So for example, I have an input here and
type = text, right?

26
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.770
Inputs can have types, but
if I put for example href here,

27
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.870
input has no concept of what href is,
right?

28
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.835
So this just doesn't do anything, the
browser's like, I don't know what this is,

29
00:01:53.835 --> 00:01:55.062
I'm going to ignore you.

30
00:01:58.153 --> 00:02:01.494
That's another thing you'll find
about HTML is, the browser will,

31
00:02:01.494 --> 00:02:04.789
if it doesn't understand something
it just ignores it and moves on.

32
00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.942
It doesn't crash or anything like that,
it's just like, you're trying to do

33
00:02:07.942 --> 00:02:10.733
something here and I don't like it,
so I'm just going to ignore you.

34
00:02:14.474 --> 00:02:17.941
So that's attributes.

35
00:02:21.164 --> 00:02:26.345
So let's look at, for example,

36
00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:33.384
here a href = www.frontendmasters.com.

37
00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:37.256
Click me.

38
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.705
You'll see here I now have a link
tag down here that if I click on,

39
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:48.541
takes me to as you see
frontendmasters.com.

40
00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:58.141
So if I try and put a type on here,
type = color, the browser is like,

41
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:02.988
I don't know what that is,
so no, you don't get that.

42
00:03:05.715 --> 00:03:10.103
So every a tag will always have an href
on it because that's how a tags work.

43
00:03:13.235 --> 00:03:18.346
Or image, src = let's see,

44
00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:23.462
I can get this one, inspect.

45
00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:32.038
So I'm just gonna grab the image to this,
Add an attribute.

46
00:03:32.038 --> 00:03:33.952
That's what I want.

47
00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:36.838
Okay, so now I can say src equals that.

48
00:03:36.838 --> 00:03:42.894
This is just a pathway to an image that
I have already stored on the website.

49
00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:47.929
And you can see here, it produces
the image here which is the course logo.

50
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.602
Now why did they make href and
src different for these?

51
00:03:53.602 --> 00:03:55.582
Cuz they both go to URLs.

52
00:03:55.582 --> 00:04:00.242
I don't know, I wasn't in the room when
they made that decision but they are.

53
00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:03.309
Images always have an src
which is a source, right?

54
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.025
Href just takes you to wherever
you wanna go for linking.

55
00:04:07.025 --> 00:04:10.205
The next question, you might ask me is,
how do I know which one to do?

56
00:04:10.205 --> 00:04:12.505
It's like,
you just have to learn it, right?

57
00:04:12.505 --> 00:04:15.195
It's kind of arbitrary and
it's what they decided to do.

58
00:04:15.195 --> 00:04:18.325
&gt;&gt; Why did you put a div around
the select options again?

59
00:04:18.325 --> 00:04:20.349
&gt;&gt; Why did I put a div
around the select option,

60
00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.165
which I think is this one here, right?

61
00:04:23.605 --> 00:04:29.121
If you look up here,
This has a div here and

62
00:04:29.121 --> 00:04:32.520
the question is, is why do I need the div?

63
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.370
Could I have just done this?

64
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.071
You absolutely could have.

65
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:39.971
There's no rhyme or
reason that I had to have a div there.

66
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:44.410
In fact, I don't think it'd actually
even really change anything.

67
00:04:46.082 --> 00:04:49.544
The only reason that I did have it
there is because I was using it to kind

68
00:04:49.544 --> 00:04:52.589
of divide it from everything else,
which a div, division,

69
00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:54.160
divides it from other things.

70
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.180
But we're kind of coming
back to round to HTML.

71
00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.992
It's totally arbitrary, right?

72
00:04:59.992 --> 00:05:01.467
It's whatever you feel like doing,

73
00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.330
whatever you feel like makes
the most sense to you.

74
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.005
When I was writing the course, I felt like
putting a div around everything to divided

75
00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:10.620
sections of things, made sense to me,
so I did it that way.

76
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.802
So just because it's
the answer to that question,

77
00:05:18.802 --> 00:05:22.556
almost everything can have a class.

78
00:05:22.556 --> 00:05:27.440
So for example, this h3 here,
I gave it a class of the red one.

79
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.240
And I have this one here,
this is the blue one.

80
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.204
And then inside of the style tag here,
which we'll talk about that when we get to

81
00:05:36.204 --> 00:05:39.305
the CSS section, but I wanted to
demonstrate to you what classes are.

82
00:05:39.305 --> 00:05:42.498
This one is red, and this one is blue.

83
00:05:45.498 --> 00:05:48.014
Classes are the way that
you kind of denote,

84
00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.600
this is what type of h3 this is to me,
right?

85
00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.045
So you'll kind of use it, one,
as documentation for yourself, so

86
00:05:55.045 --> 00:05:57.978
the red one and the blue one doesn't
really add any meaning to it.

87
00:05:57.978 --> 00:06:00.665
But this could be
the brand of my website and

88
00:06:00.665 --> 00:06:03.510
this one could be the name of my blog,
right?

89
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.040
And they could be different things.

90
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.090
And you'd be showing to yourself later.

91
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.081
So no one's gonna see your classes other
than anyone that inspects your code,

92
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.110
which you're not really making website for
them, right?

93
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.230
So a class is just a way to say,
this is what this is,

94
00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.840
this is what type of h3
that I'm having here.

95
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.819
And what's nice about that is
if you give it useful names,

96
00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:28.535
it makes it really easy later to
come back and do all your CSS4.

97
00:06:30.785 --> 00:06:35.865
But it's a way to show that there are,
you yourself have different

98
00:06:35.865 --> 00:06:40.775
types of attributes or
different types of H3s or divs or spans.

99
00:06:41.805 --> 00:06:44.435
All of these things that I've shown you so
far can have a class, right?

100
00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:49.150
So this can have a class = my text input.

101
00:06:52.618 --> 00:06:55.720
And the other thing is it can have
multiple types, multiple classes rather.

102
00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:00.660
We'll get into why that's important later.

103
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.555
But you separate them with the space,
that's all,

104
00:07:04.555 --> 00:07:08.240
which is why I'm using dashes here for
the spaces of the class name.

105
00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:15.701
But then later you can come back with CSS
and you can style it based on your class

106
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:18.770
names, which is typically why you're
gonna give things class names.

107
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.904
But it's the way that I have some
paragraphs that look this way,

108
00:07:25.904 --> 00:07:28.030
other paragraphs look other ways.

109
00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:30.020
Technically this is an anchor tag, right?

110
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.938
This watch on Frontend Masters button,
but it's styled differently and

111
00:07:33.938 --> 00:07:37.301
I'm able to do that because I
give them different class names.

112
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.090
In other words,
classes are mostly important for CSS and

113
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:54.220
they're kind of important for yourself to
know what type of HTML you're looking at.

114
00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.270
For now what's cool is I can come back.

115
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.938
Let's say later I come back and
I write another h3 here and I say, well,

116
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:02.419
I want this one to be the same
style as the red one.

117
00:08:06.042 --> 00:08:07.801
This is also red.

118
00:08:12.464 --> 00:08:17.364
Just having a real,
it's cuz I needed to do this.

119
00:08:17.364 --> 00:08:19.267
I didn't have to write any more CSS,
right?

120
00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:22.190
Just because I reused this red one,
class, right?

121
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:24.318
This one also became red.

122
00:08:24.318 --> 00:08:28.525
Or let's say I could decide later, it's
like no, this was better as the blue one.

123
00:08:28.525 --> 00:08:31.050
And now it's lying to you, [LAUGH] right?

124
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:32.117
But now this is blue.

125
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.092
Okay, so that's classes.

126
00:08:41.092 --> 00:08:44.030
And we'll, again,
we're about to do a whole section on CSS,

127
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.857
so you can ignore the CSS part
just know that the class parts,

128
00:08:46.857 --> 00:08:48.645
the part that I want you to learn here.

129
00:08:54.625 --> 00:08:56.040
We'll talk about IDs in a second.

130
00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.481
So I have this one down here that
this one is red and bold, so

131
00:09:01.481 --> 00:09:05.060
they can have multiple different classes,
right?

132
00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.181
So I made this bolded class down here and

133
00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:10.370
now this is not only red cuz
it has the red one class.

134
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.779
But it's also bolded cuz it has
the bolded class which I wrote here.

135
00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:24.674
And yeah, we just space, that's how
you get multiple different classes.

136
00:09:27.664 --> 00:09:28.164
Okay?

137
00:09:30.128 --> 00:09:35.370
So first, let's say classes are so
much more useful than IDs.

138
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.447
I'm gonna show you how to work with IDs,
because they're important and

139
00:09:38.447 --> 00:09:41.121
they're gonna be in a lot of
different bits of documentation,

140
00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:43.850
you'll find them in code
that you have to maintain.

141
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.541
But I'm gonna say 95%, and
that's probably underselling it,

142
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:50.725
99.9% of the time you should
use classes and not IDs.

143
00:09:50.725 --> 00:09:53.177
IDs are meant to be very, very sparing.

144
00:09:56.212 --> 00:09:59.350
Classes are not unique,
that's the important thing.

145
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.590
So, for example, here I have a blue
one here and a blue one here, right?

146
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.067
So it's not unique in the sense
that there's not only one blue one,

147
00:10:08.067 --> 00:10:10.693
there can be as many blue
ones as possible, right?

148
00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.962
You can have as many of them as you want.

149
00:10:12.962 --> 00:10:16.291
With an ID, you can only have one, right?

150
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:21.459
So this one I have this h3 here,
so you can make that an h1,

151
00:10:22.543 --> 00:10:25.490
And I have an id = brand here, right?

152
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:31.474
That means that on this particular page,
there is no other brand, right?

153
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:37.359
That's the key difference
between classes and IDs.

154
00:10:37.359 --> 00:10:41.937
IDs there's just one,
classes there's zero to infinity of them.

155
00:10:45.332 --> 00:10:47.200
So that's why I like classes in general.

156
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.060
If I do a bunch of work to do like some
CSS for this one particular red one here.

157
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.424
If I do it on a class, that means I can
use that over and over and over again.

158
00:10:56.424 --> 00:11:00.140
I just had to do it once and now I can
reuse it a bunch of different times.

159
00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:04.466
If I do this on an ID and
I do a bunch of stuff to the id = brand,

160
00:11:04.466 --> 00:11:06.640
I can only ever use that once.

161
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.990
Which in general, as programmers,
we wanna be as lazy as possible.

162
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.733
We wanna write code once and
use it as many times as we can.

163
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.970
So I'm just gonna tell
you just use classes.

164
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.768
Until you learn to tell me that I'm wrong,
just use classes

165
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:31.410
And in general I think I use IDs,
Once a year, right?

166
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.237
It's really rare that I need to use
them whereas I use classes every day,

167
00:11:35.237 --> 00:11:37.765
multiple times a day,
multiple times an hour.

168
00:11:42.989 --> 00:11:45.250
Why would you want to use an ID?

169
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.763
So like the id = brand,

170
00:11:46.763 --> 00:11:50.861
you are only gonna have one brand
on your page guaranteed or one.

171
00:11:50.861 --> 00:11:53.834
Like this complete intro to Web Dev V3,

172
00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:57.560
I am not going to reuse this on the page,
right?

173
00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.060
I have just one of those.

174
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:02.220
That would be an acceptable reason
that you might wanna use an ID.

175
00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.997
Actually, probably even more
importantly is you can,

176
00:12:06.997 --> 00:12:10.130
let's see if I can just
show you this really quick.

177
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.520
So this id="ids" here, that's cool.

178
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.276
Okay, so what I can do here,
let's say I had an a tag.

179
00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:26.420
Go to the ids header.

180
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.454
So if I do it like this, I now have
a link here and if I click this,

181
00:12:33.454 --> 00:12:36.200
notice that it scrolls me to the IDs.

182
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.866
So that is one useful reason
to use IDs is cuz now you can

183
00:12:40.866 --> 00:12:44.820
have a link directly to
that part of the page.

184
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.639
So if I click that up here and notice,

185
00:12:46.639 --> 00:12:50.001
it'll scroll me all the way down
to where I'm trying to go, right?

186
00:12:50.001 --> 00:12:54.482
So that is one compelling
reason to you might use IDs.

187
00:12:54.482 --> 00:13:00.574
Notice that pound ID right there,
that's how you do that.

188
00:13:00.574 --> 00:13:04.525
&gt;&gt; Is it best practice to
embed a link to an image?

189
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:12.292
&gt;&gt; Is it best practice to
embed a link to an image?

190
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:15.150
&gt;&gt; I guess when you use
an image to link to its source.

191
00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.152
&gt;&gt; So that's an okay question,

192
00:13:20.152 --> 00:13:25.306
let's say I have my image here,
do I still have that?

193
00:13:25.306 --> 00:13:26.130
I do.

194
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.171
Okay, so I have an image here.

195
00:13:28.171 --> 00:13:30.660
Right now this image doesn't do anything,
right?

196
00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.480
It's just an image on a page.

197
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.514
So if you wanted to make
that image link somewhere,

198
00:13:39.514 --> 00:13:43.154
what you can do is you
can put an href = .,

199
00:13:43.154 --> 00:13:47.140
I don't know, Github.com or
something like that.

200
00:13:53.695 --> 00:13:56.598
So now this link, if I click on it,

201
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.226
I guess I might have to
put the https:// there.

202
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.932
So now if I click on that link
it'll take me to github.com, right?

203
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.480
So that's the way that you
make an image link somewhere,

204
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.215
is you put whatever you want to be linked,
right?

205
00:14:24.215 --> 00:14:25.670
And you can put a's around anything,
right?

206
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.955
So if I wanted to make
the entire page link somewhere,

207
00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:32.023
I would wrap the entire
body with an a tag, right?

208
00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.846
But this allows you to have an image
that comes from somewhere and

209
00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:42.110
then a tag that leads somewhere else,
right?

210
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:44.389
And I mean you can make
them the same thing.

211
00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.391
If I do this what do you expect to happen?

212
00:14:53.944 --> 00:14:55.680
Well, it should just link
into the image itself.

213
00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.408
So now if I click on here, notice it's
literally just a link to the image itself.

214
00:15:07.045 --> 00:15:09.613
So that's why they disambiguate the two.

215
00:15:09.613 --> 00:15:13.446
But if you ever want clicking
on something to go somewhere,

216
00:15:13.446 --> 00:15:16.130
you have to use an a tag, have to.

217
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:16.630
That's the only way to do it.

218
00:15:23.144 --> 00:15:26.090
But I mean you can wrap entire
blocks of things in a's, right?

219
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:28.280
So if I do this and this,

220
00:15:33.548 --> 00:15:36.310
Now, all of this is an a tag.

221
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:41.380
So if I click on, this is red, or
if I click over here or over here,

222
00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:47.314
all of this stuff, no matter what,
will all go to wherever I tell it to link.

223
00:15:51.194 --> 00:15:52.895
GitHub.com, right?

224
00:15:52.895 --> 00:15:56.714
So now if I click on the blue one here,
all takes me to GitHub.
