1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.846
We've style by classes, we've styled
by tags, let's go style by ID.

2
00:00:06.682 --> 00:00:11.407
Do you remember how I told
you don't use IDs very often

3
00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:15.827
this is part of the reason
why I don't want you to.

4
00:00:15.827 --> 00:00:19.327
Okay, so let's say I have
an h1 here of site brand, and

5
00:00:19.327 --> 00:00:21.858
I gave it a bunch of classes, right?

6
00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:28.295
Nav-head nav-main other-useful-class and
I have two selectors here site-brand, and

7
00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:35.170
this just incredibly specific selector,
h1, nav-head, nav-main other-useful-class.

8
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.320
Let's put another nav-head in there for
fun it's infinite, right?

9
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.768
So many classes,
which of these two is more specific?

10
00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:46.460
&gt;&gt; ID
&gt;&gt; The ID, right?

11
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.022
So if classes are in the 10 places
then IDs are in the 100 place, right?

12
00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:58.963
So this is red so this is why I don't
want you to use IDs very much it's

13
00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:03.737
like they're sledgehammer they
just blowing all the classes and

14
00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:06.272
end up overriding a lot of things.

15
00:01:06.272 --> 00:01:11.349
And imagine later if you're
trying to cascade on top of that,

16
00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:18.000
you end up in these wild situations where
you have each one side-brand, right?

17
00:01:19.747 --> 00:01:23.290
Color blue.

18
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.940
So yeah that works right, but
then what you have to be on top of that?

19
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.991
Well then you can be like,
Sorry my spacing here is a little off.

20
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.140
So I mean all of these things, right?

21
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.920
Apply but if you're looking at someone's
style sheet, which of these applies?

22
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.870
It's hard to tell, right?

23
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.180
At a glance you kind of go through and
do the math.

24
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.920
No ain't nobody wanna do some math, right?

25
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.423
We just wanna know what applies.

26
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.290
And if you look at this in the inspector
it's gonna be a hot mess to look at.

27
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.337
So look at all these crossed out colors
here, they're like nope this one.

28
00:02:17.592 --> 00:02:20.055
Yeah, it's ridiculous.

29
00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:28.607
And by the way if your CSS
selectors looked like this,

30
00:02:28.607 --> 00:02:32.280
I don't know quit your job I would be so
upset.

31
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.620
Furthermore, the problem typically
is not that they're lined out this.

32
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.580
Even when they're lined out
like this it's hard to tell.

33
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.236
Typically they're in six different files
and you don't know where they are, right?

34
00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:45.517
And then you have to hunt through
multiple files looking for

35
00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:49.204
this one selector that's clobbering
all of URLs so frustrating.

36
00:02:49.204 --> 00:02:53.410
I'm saying this hopefully to save
you select future hell, right?

37
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.261
Cuz it's not fun.

38
00:02:57.162 --> 00:02:58.227
Okay.

39
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:05.183
So site-brand 2, what color is site brand?

40
00:03:09.427 --> 00:03:17.872
This important if IDs are in the 100
place important is in the 1000s place.

41
00:03:21.687 --> 00:03:24.592
Never use important if
you're using important,

42
00:03:24.592 --> 00:03:27.225
you're doing something absolutely wrong.

43
00:03:27.225 --> 00:03:34.385
The person that invented important
regrets it [LAUGH] The reason why they

44
00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:38.406
invented important is cuz they thought
that it would be useful for compliance.

45
00:03:38.406 --> 00:03:43.030
So, some people have to adhere to certain
government accessibility, compliance,

46
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.121
things like that and

47
00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:48.374
they were worried that the government
would sue people if they had a too small.

48
00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:52.376
So they had to have this important so
that could never be overridden,

49
00:03:52.376 --> 00:03:56.654
ended up not being really that big of
a deal because the government ruled on

50
00:03:56.654 --> 00:03:58.253
in an accessibility case.

51
00:03:58.253 --> 00:04:02.541
That if a user makes it smaller it's not
in compliance the user chose that but

52
00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:06.025
they were worried about that when
they drafted the standard or

53
00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:09.514
it's somewhat similar to that,
that was my understanding.

54
00:04:09.514 --> 00:04:15.567
So once you start getting into weird stuff
like this, then you will start seeing,

55
00:04:20.106 --> 00:04:25.249
Important important was
it like this I don't

56
00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:30.254
know there some world
things they can do or,

57
00:04:30.254 --> 00:04:33.111
that what it is, right?

58
00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:38.286
Now that this are both important it
cast down to some selective, right?

59
00:04:38.286 --> 00:04:41.824
Which if you see something that's
important to not being implied,

60
00:04:41.824 --> 00:04:44.005
you are in a special kind of hell, right?

61
00:04:44.005 --> 00:04:48.670
Because there's nothing above important
well actually there is something [LAUGH]

62
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.180
above important and that's inline style.

63
00:04:52.676 --> 00:04:56.080
No I don't think that even inline style
I think important is the most one.

64
00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.325
Now I'm getting into the edge
of my knowledge color pink.

65
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:07.918
Yeah, so that's what this is important
will even blow up blow away inline styles.

66
00:05:07.918 --> 00:05:10.547
So if I get rid of both
of these importance,

67
00:05:15.388 --> 00:05:20.852
Inline styles so I put my style
here actually does out cascade IDs.

68
00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:27.750
But imagine that you're trying to write
your CSS, you use a ID selector and

69
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.489
it's not even applying then,
it's confusing, right?

70
00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:35.019
So, I'm trying to show you all of this
confusion up front so that you're like I

71
00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:38.294
don't wanna do anything with that
I'm just gonna use classes, right?

72
00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:42.852
If that's what you're feeling right now,
I have succeeded, I am a great teacher,

73
00:05:42.852 --> 00:05:44.262
I pat myself on the back and

74
00:05:44.262 --> 00:05:48.080
you're gonna go forth well
equipped to be great developers.

75
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.140
This took me years of being an idiot to
figure out that's why I'm trying to show

76
00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.539
you how to not be an idiot,
cuz nobody taught me this way, right?

77
00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.521
I just read in the book I was like IDs
selectors that just does everything I

78
00:05:59.521 --> 00:06:01.314
wanna do and I just did it, right?

79
00:06:01.314 --> 00:06:05.483
So, don't be like Brian well
don't be like past Brian maybe

80
00:06:05.483 --> 00:06:09.735
enough current Brian either I
don't know that's up to you but

81
00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:13.613
definitely don't be past
Brian nobody likes that guy.

82
00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:18.887
Okay, any questions about the cascade?

83
00:06:18.887 --> 00:06:23.884
I've more or less showing you
the entire cascade hierarchy, yeah.

84
00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:28.730
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to bring in
something to prioritize the CSS styles

85
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:32.580
you made like a JavaScript
that's do this first?

86
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.410
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

87
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.293
So, if you're not from
this Twitter Bootstrap or

88
00:06:39.293 --> 00:06:43.551
there's a myriad of other
of CSS frameworks, right?

89
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:46.273
Or CSS toolkit of if someone went and

90
00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:50.550
made a bunch of really useful
pre-made styles for you.

91
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.510
So let's let's just look
at Twitter Bootstrap.

92
00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:02.030
Look at components here, right?

93
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.140
So for these really nice looking buttons,
right?

94
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.909
This is all just CSS, right?

95
00:07:09.038 --> 00:07:13.491
Or there's large button and small
button and all these kinds of things,

96
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:16.557
a good question is if I
bring all these toolkits and

97
00:07:16.557 --> 00:07:19.202
sometimes I still have
to write CSS on top.

98
00:07:19.202 --> 00:07:22.744
I almost always have to write
some CSS on top of that and

99
00:07:22.744 --> 00:07:27.942
it can get really frustrating trying
to balance what Twitter's including for

100
00:07:27.942 --> 00:07:29.610
this is made by Twitter.

101
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.220
So what Bootstrap is including for
me, versus what I'm trying to write.

102
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:39.500
So the first thing is always
load your CSS last, right?

103
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.408
Cuz if you remember all of your
CSS the last one wins if they have

104
00:07:45.408 --> 00:07:48.564
equal specificity, so that'll help.

105
00:07:48.564 --> 00:07:54.260
Beyond that you just have to end up being
more specific than Bootstrap, right?

106
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.619
So if you have a selector that's like,

107
00:08:00.404 --> 00:08:08.285
Nav let's say one of theirs is like
button, Or let's do it this way.

108
00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:15.082
Button class = btn btn large or
something like that.

109
00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:26.396
Right, so
I make this button the built in stylesheet

110
00:08:26.396 --> 00:08:31.132
to bootstrap will have .btn .btn large.

111
00:08:31.132 --> 00:08:35.915
And if you're trying to override something
even more than that you'll have to

112
00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:39.035
have something with at least two classes,
right?

113
00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:40.450
&gt;&gt; Okay.

114
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:45.796
&gt;&gt; Cuz you have to out cascade it,
which is not fun, right?

115
00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:50.572
It's generally why I tell you avoid
cascading things because then it gets

116
00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:51.790
really messy.

117
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.474
Unfortunately in this case you just
kinda have to get in there and

118
00:08:56.474 --> 00:08:57.870
get messy with it.

119
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.738
So your CSS selector will
end up looking like .btn.

120
00:09:01.738 --> 00:09:07.788
What I'll probably advise you to
do is add some class of your own,

121
00:09:07.788 --> 00:09:10.430
and just say my btn, right?

122
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.299
And then you'll do, Your stuff here,

123
00:09:15.299 --> 00:09:22.570
by the side you do comments /* */,
it's different in CSS than it is in HTML.

124
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:29.340
As long as this comes after, you'll
out cascade it, right, cuz it's last.

125
00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.900
That's generally what I advise you to do.

126
00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:37.656
If you have to out cascaded again
you'll either have to add something

127
00:09:37.656 --> 00:09:39.610
like that be large.

128
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.525
In general I'll just
repeat my class again.

129
00:09:44.797 --> 00:09:47.409
Just so this ends up being more heavy.

130
00:09:47.409 --> 00:09:52.604
And if you're doing beyond three you
need to ask yourself some questions

131
00:09:52.604 --> 00:09:57.299
of can I rearchitect this so
I don't have to do so much cascading?

132
00:09:57.299 --> 00:09:58.540
Does that answer your question?

133
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.614
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it would have to be
in the same style sheet then.

134
00:10:02.614 --> 00:10:05.864
&gt;&gt; It does not matter which
style sheet it comes from,

135
00:10:05.864 --> 00:10:08.140
cuz they're all equally applied.

136
00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:09.652
So, I would include and

137
00:10:09.652 --> 00:10:13.672
I'll show you how to include
stylesheets here in a little bit.

138
00:10:13.672 --> 00:10:15.182
But I will include bootstrap first and

139
00:10:15.182 --> 00:10:17.600
then underneath that I'll
include my styles, right?

140
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.450
&gt;&gt; Like when you're listening in the head?

141
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:19.991
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

142
00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:21.810
&gt;&gt; That's where it comes
last okay I got it.

143
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.780
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry I should have been
more specific it's a terrible joke.

144
00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.452
I am a dad now I get to make dad jokes.

145
00:10:30.452 --> 00:10:32.609
So legally I can make dad jokes.

146
00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:38.932
I hate that joke we probably
should cut that it's

147
00:10:38.932 --> 00:10:43.650
terrible [LAUGH] I'm kidding
you can leave it in there.

148
00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:45.250
Cool, other questions?

149
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:54.020
Okay, avoid the cascade it's a tool to
be used sparingly, that's the point.
