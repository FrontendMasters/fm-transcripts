00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.588
So again, the project we were
working on was this, Coffee Masters.

2
00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:08.193
Let's just break it down
piece by piece how I did it.

3
00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:10.861
And again, this is just one approach
to it, you don't have to do it my way.

4
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:15.277
You could have done it
any way you wanted to.

5
00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:23.358
So let's take maybe a look first at
my HTML here and how I modeled it.

6
00:00:23.358 --> 00:00:30.148
So I had my style sheets here that I
declared, I got my Google fonts here.

7
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.798
Okay?
And we have a nav,

8
00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:39.956
let's make this a lot bigger.

9
00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:47.690
Have a nav, and that's gonna contain
this Coffee Masters top part, right?

10
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.420
So has a nav, has a brand and
has an image in there and Coffee Masters.

11
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.855
And then I have a page here,

12
00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.845
two pages like basically
everything underneath the nav.

13
00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:01.936
You might ask why I didn't put
the nav inside of the page,

14
00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:04.912
cuz I want the nav to go all
the way to the sides, right?

15
00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:09.573
So there's no padding here kind of on the
sides, whereas I wanted this to be kind of

16
00:01:09.573 --> 00:01:13.641
indented a little bit on all the sides
that's why I kept them separate.

17
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.696
Okay, I have this box class that
I did which is, this is a box,

18
00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:22.493
the items, the name, and

19
00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:27.740
the payment cuz they all have the same
kind of general style, right?

20
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.378
So same background colors,
same rounded corners,

21
00:01:31.378 --> 00:01:34.730
margins between them, drop shadow.

22
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.514
So I kind of did this one a box class and
you can see that is

23
00:01:39.514 --> 00:01:44.091
shared across the name box and
this credit card box.

24
00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:50.299
So from there I have the items,
that's an h2 and

25
00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.570
then an unordered a list of the items.

26
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.842
And notice I have a nested unordered list,
right?

27
00:01:56.842 --> 00:01:58.433
So I have the items but

28
00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:03.928
in addition all of these options as
well I chose to make it unordered list.

29
00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:07.541
So you can nest those lists as well,
that's totally possible.

30
00:02:10.482 --> 00:02:14.201
Okay, and then here I just kinda gave
them the name of items, item quantity,

31
00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:15.230
item title.

32
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.646
So this convention that I have here of
item, item dash quality or quantity,

33
00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:24.135
item dash title, it's not necessarily
any sort of thing that you have to do.

34
00:02:24.135 --> 00:02:27.573
I just find it easier for
me to read at a glance that like,

35
00:02:27.573 --> 00:02:32.270
all right, this belongs to item,
can give it some sort of hierarchy there.

36
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.230
But again totally up to you.

37
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.450
So that's all of this part
here on the left, the items.

38
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.050
Then here in the payment box, which would
be or a sales to the name box first.

39
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.400
Yeah, have the name box, that's inside
of this sort of payment section.

40
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.210
So I made this entire,
inspect here to show you this,

41
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.850
might even be easier
to visualize this way.

42
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.337
So order boxes over their,
payment boxes over here.

43
00:03:08.337 --> 00:03:12.257
I chose to make this payment section
include both of the name box and

44
00:03:12.257 --> 00:03:16.330
the credit card boss cuz they're
kind of in the same column, right?

45
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.344
If you look at the original design,

46
00:03:18.344 --> 00:03:22.640
you can see these actually aren't
even the same height here, right?

47
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.870
Might end up being really similar in
height, that was purely kinda by accident.

48
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.820
I didn't actually intend for
that to happen, but it did.

49
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.345
Certain looks kind of
nice that way anyway.

50
00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:36.181
But I put them in the same section because
they end up being in the same column and

51
00:03:36.181 --> 00:03:38.392
that made it really easy to lay out.

52
00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:40.338
You don't have to do it that way.

53
00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:43.859
You could totally make a grid where
those end up being separate things and

54
00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.800
that would have been a totally
acceptable way of doing that as well.

55
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.333
Okay, there's a title in there.

56
00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:55.524
And then there's an input group here,
where I made the input and

57
00:03:55.524 --> 00:03:58.891
the label together inside of this
one div that made it really easy for

58
00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:00.864
everything to be overlaid correctly.

59
00:04:03.662 --> 00:04:07.400
Okay, and
then same here with this credit card box.

60
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.890
I have two input groups.

61
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.630
Which include the labels and
the inputs as well as the title.

62
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.832
So this name boxes and credit card box
end up being really, really similar.

63
00:04:18.832 --> 00:04:22.052
Okay, and then down here for the totals,

64
00:04:22.052 --> 00:04:26.130
just put that all in one
little section here.

65
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.159
It's got a table,
you don't have to do this with tables but

66
00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:35.234
it's kind of tabular data, so it made
sense for me to do it with the table but

67
00:04:35.234 --> 00:04:39.504
you could have just as easily
done this with an unordered list,

68
00:04:39.504 --> 00:04:41.620
all sorts of things like that.

69
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.102
So yeah, T body, table row and
then table definition.

70
00:04:47.127 --> 00:04:51.692
And then it just gave this final
total rolls an extra class of final

71
00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:56.257
totals cuz that way it was made it
really easy to make that bolden.

72
00:04:56.257 --> 00:04:57.525
And then a button.

73
00:04:57.525 --> 00:04:58.615
That's it.

74
00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:00.189
So that's the HTML.
