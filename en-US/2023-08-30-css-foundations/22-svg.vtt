1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.850
You might have heard of SVG before.

2
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.910
We're not gonna go too, too in depth what
it stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.020
So it's an XML based markup language
that describes two dimensional graphics.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.992
It's also a text based or

5
00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:19.220
open web standard scribing images that
can be rendered cleanly at any size.

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.920
Works really well with other
web standards like CSS.

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.330
So unlike JPEG or PNG, SVG can be rendered
at any size without loss of quality.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.940
So it's really great, and we'll see
that with some of the icons, right?

9
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.597
We can also change some of the properties
of SVG, like the color of it,

10
00:00:36.597 --> 00:00:40.619
which is super useful, so you don't
have to load different types of assets.

11
00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:44.490
So you might have heard of inline SVG.

12
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.458
There are a couple benefits to
using inline SVG, for reference,

13
00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:50.310
this is what it looks like.

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.838
You're literally defining the element
inline, so you're seeing the path and

15
00:00:53.838 --> 00:00:56.850
the strokes, and things like that,
that's what that looks like.

16
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.823
So there are fewer HTTP requests.

17
00:00:58.823 --> 00:01:01.263
You're not requesting a file, it's there.

18
00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:06.235
And we can use fill property and change
the color of our strokes and our paths and

19
00:01:06.235 --> 00:01:08.250
things like that.

20
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.449
Unfortunately, it is a little bit verbose,
like this isn't the nice thing to look at,

21
00:01:12.449 --> 00:01:14.006
but it does have some benefits.

22
00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:18.437
The alternative is you have
a link to an SVG file,

23
00:01:18.437 --> 00:01:20.530
which is absolutely
something that you can do.

24
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.677
But again, it's gonna require a request.

25
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.130
With images, we're gonna be
working with them in the code.

26
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.055
It's a little bit easier to explain like,
in real time, so

27
00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:35.340
I didn't put any slides in there.

28
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.720
We're just gonna jump into it and
explain things as we go.

29
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.881
Okay, homepage is done.

30
00:01:40.622 --> 00:01:44.700
Here's our speaker page,
white background, orange text.

31
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.109
Right now, we have an orange
background and white text.

32
00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:52.623
So, let's start at the top, our header
does not have the same styles as our

33
00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:55.001
homepage, right,
we need to apply apply those.

34
00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.668
Does anyone know why they're not
being applied at the moment if we

35
00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:00.075
open our speakers page?

36
00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:05.583
How come there are styles aren't being
applied there in the base file here?

37
00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:07.478
So why are they not applied?

38
00:02:13.113 --> 00:02:18.142
That's because we don't have any class
names on our elements here, right?

39
00:02:18.142 --> 00:02:20.837
I'm gonna copy and paste for
time sake here, but

40
00:02:20.837 --> 00:02:25.420
here in our index file we have to find
all these like them class names, right?

41
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.120
I'm gonna copy and paste over our
nav here, to our speakers file.

42
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.590
Okay, so when we do that, look at that.

43
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.298
Magically, it's beautiful again.

44
00:02:40.484 --> 00:02:43.574
So let's address the color
palette change here.

45
00:02:43.574 --> 00:02:46.490
So while the homepage has an orange
background with white text,

46
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.930
speakers page has a white
background with orange text.

47
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.247
So in order to alleviate this, I'm gonna
create a body class on both a class for

48
00:02:55.247 --> 00:02:59.310
the body elements on both Home and
Speakers.

49
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.647
So let's go ahead and do that.

50
00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:04.900
So in our index file, we'll start there,
set a class on the body.

51
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.000
So we'll call it body, and this one will
have a modifier, we'll call it primary.

52
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.289
It's our primary color palette.

53
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.357
Speakers will be very similar, but
it'll be secondary, body, body, secondary.

54
00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.047
So in our base file here,

55
00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:28.730
remember we defined all of these styles on
the body element here, let's change that.

56
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.376
So we still wanna keep this font family,
I'm gonna leave that there.

57
00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:32.449
Let's just pull out these.

58
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:38.457
So we still wanna have those,
stay body, Primary.

59
00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:43.253
Well, we can set those
values back on there,

60
00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:47.431
right, it's working like expected.

61
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:51.170
I'm gonna copy and paste this for
the secondary as well, secondary.

62
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.979
Text on primary, again, I could create new
variables for this, but at this point,

63
00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.640
it's kind of a matter of opinion how
many variables you wanna create.

64
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.244
Color, primary, like that.

65
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.390
Cool, so there we go.

66
00:04:09.628 --> 00:04:12.044
However, something is
wrong with our header.

67
00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.040
Anyone know what's wrong with our header?

68
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.460
We're missing our shopping cart,
it's gone away.

69
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.133
Well, at least it looks like it has.

70
00:04:21.133 --> 00:04:23.050
It's actually still there, right?

71
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.520
That's because we are importing
this SVG using the image tag.

72
00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.420
And so, SVGs rendered as images,
they're not gonna inherit color.

73
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.530
So instead,
let's change these to inline SVGs.

74
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.910
I'm going to go into our File Explorer,
let's say icons, shopping.cart.

75
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.100
Let's copy all of this SVG
code as ugly as it is.

76
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:55.921
I'm going to replace the image of
this icon with the inline svg, right?

77
00:04:55.921 --> 00:04:57.380
It's angry, but it will work.

78
00:04:59.604 --> 00:05:02.550
Let me see here.

79
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.730
So as soon as I save this and
go back to the homepage, it still renders.

80
00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:09.730
So that works great.

81
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.110
It renders properly in the homepage.

82
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.183
How do we make this orange
on our speakers page?

83
00:05:15.183 --> 00:05:16.347
Let's inspect this again.

84
00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:20.832
It would help if I replaced
all the speakers page two.

85
00:05:20.832 --> 00:05:22.937
Let me do that, okay?

86
00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:31.833
So now, It's there, it's an inline SVG,
but it's still not visible.

87
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:36.672
There are a couple of different
properties that we can use on this

88
00:05:36.672 --> 00:05:38.742
SVG to change the styling.

89
00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:47.110
So if I highlight this SVG,
let's just say for fun, give it a stroke.

90
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.930
Let's change the stroke color to orange.

91
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.430
Look at that, we see our icon.

92
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.053
It looks like just an outline,
a very thin outline, right?

93
00:05:55.053 --> 00:05:57.800
So we're changing the stroke
color of this SVG.

94
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.890
Instead, there's something called fill.

95
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.663
Now, it's not gonna work around the SVG,
in fact,

96
00:06:05.663 --> 00:06:07.440
we have to go in and find the path.

97
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.480
We can say fill orange, right?

98
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.740
So by finding this path element,
we can set the color of it right there.

99
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.941
So we don't need a separate file,
we can just change this in our CSS code.

100
00:06:20.103 --> 00:06:23.239
So let's do that,

101
00:06:23.239 --> 00:06:28.540
I'm going to give this a class.

102
00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:35.830
This is on my Speakers page class =,
we'll call you shopping-cart-icon.

103
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.259
We'll give this a primary.

104
00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:43.541
All right, this one will be secondary,
no, it's a primary color.

105
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:45.510
So I'm giving it a primary name here.

106
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.120
So shopping-cart icon primary.

107
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.450
This is just for the Speaker's page.

108
00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.750
So let's go ahead into our
speaker CSS file, target this.

109
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.666
Now, we tried to set the fill
on the SVG element itself,

110
00:06:58.666 --> 00:07:01.600
notice it didn't work, right?

111
00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.910
We need to target this path.

112
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.750
So in order to do that, we can see here
inside SVG, we've got g, we've got path.

113
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.049
So that's how we're gonna target that.

114
00:07:11.049 --> 00:07:14.702
We're gonna say, target the g and
then target path.

115
00:07:14.702 --> 00:07:16.802
And then we can go ahead and
set the fill on there.

116
00:07:18.808 --> 00:07:22.000
And we will use our color-primer.

117
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.051
Color-primary, there we go.

118
00:07:26.784 --> 00:07:27.622
So that's working.

119
00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:31.910
So now on our home page, it's white,
on our speakers page, it's orange, and

120
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.158
we only have one file, so that's great.

121
00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:37.310
Or we don't even need
the file because it's inline.

122
00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.460
The content is right up against
the viewport yet again, right?

123
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.149
So it doesn't have the same
padding around it.

124
00:07:45.134 --> 00:07:48.898
Our index page remember we set
a class on that main content area, and

125
00:07:48.898 --> 00:07:50.892
that's where we defined padding.

126
00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:54.205
Where do you go?

127
00:07:54.205 --> 00:07:58.647
Main, I moved into home, didn't I?

128
00:07:58.647 --> 00:07:59.760
Yeah, here we go, main.

129
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.440
We set a padding on
the homepage of 150 pixels.

130
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.742
We set that on our main element, right?

131
00:08:07.889 --> 00:08:09.948
We need to do the same thing for
our speakers page,

132
00:08:09.948 --> 00:08:11.919
so, the content sign up
against the viewport.

133
00:08:14.188 --> 00:08:17.398
So let's go ahead and
add a class to our main content area.

134
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:22.000
Class is main.

135
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.300
Now, remember I said, we've defined
that in the index file, right?

136
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.173
So I'm gonna pull this out,
it's gonna be common and

137
00:08:33.173 --> 00:08:34.940
shared across both of our pages.

138
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:36.912
I'm gonna plop it into the base file.

139
00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:38.128
It's being imported into both.

140
00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:40.741
So yeah, we see it now, but of course,

141
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:45.040
there's some overflow issues
with some of these large images.

142
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.335
We're gonna ignore that, but
at least the padding is there now.

143
00:08:55.212 --> 00:08:59.683
And real quick, back in our index file,
there were two other selectors here that

144
00:08:59.683 --> 00:09:04.310
styled the main element, right, but these
were really specific to the home page.

145
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.763
So, I could keep them listed as like
main heading and main subheading,

146
00:09:07.763 --> 00:09:08.743
but semantically,

147
00:09:08.743 --> 00:09:12.500
it's a little bit confusing because
this is not being applied to both pages.

148
00:09:14.177 --> 00:09:20.145
So, inside of our index.html file again,
let's do something like this.

149
00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:24.370
We've got our classes on our body here.

150
00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:28.200
We had body primary and index,
and body secondary and speakers.

151
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.856
Let's add a third class here,
we'll call this one home.

152
00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:36.670
We'll do the same here, but
we'll call this one speakers, all right?

153
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:40.380
So now, back inside of our index
file set of just mean heading,

154
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.160
we can be extra clear that this is
living inside of the home page,

155
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.880
or the home element, or
element containing the class of home.

156
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.343
So it should be pretty clear
looking at this like, okay,

157
00:09:52.343 --> 00:09:57.302
this is not for every main heading, it's
the main headings inside of the homepage.

158
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.289
Just to check that I
haven't broken anything.

159
00:10:00.289 --> 00:10:01.734
Yeah, it's still working.

160
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:06.491
We'll do the same thing here
with the speaker's page, right,

161
00:10:06.491 --> 00:10:11.704
cuz we do have a title in our speakers
page here, right, it's an h1.

162
00:10:11.704 --> 00:10:16.193
So we'll give this a class main_title,
right?

163
00:10:16.193 --> 00:10:19.002
All right, so
we're still using that main, but

164
00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:21.889
we wanna preface it now
by that speaker's class.

165
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:27.853
We just added on our body
speakers main_title, like that.

166
00:10:27.853 --> 00:10:30.944
We need a larger font size here,
98 pixels for that heading.

167
00:10:30.944 --> 00:10:33.610
All right, so there we go.

168
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.363
That was a little more like our design,
let's go back over here.
