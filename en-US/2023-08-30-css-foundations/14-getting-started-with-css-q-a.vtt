00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.240
If this feels fast for you,
that's totally normal.

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.022
I would encourage to re-watch it and

3
00:00:07.022 --> 00:00:10.660
try to do these things first,
and then watch how I do it.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.589
I know this is a little bit hard in
real time, but the more you practice,

5
00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.310
the easier it gets, I promise.

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.177
&gt;&gt; There's some back chatter about
somebody is newer to the industry, and

7
00:00:23.177 --> 00:00:28.442
they're trying to figure out how much do
I read about all the latest techniques

8
00:00:28.442 --> 00:00:33.342
versus looking at obviously they're
here learning the fundamentals.

9
00:00:33.342 --> 00:00:38.753
And yeah, in general I just said it's
fine to be watching videos like this and

10
00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:43.433
reading as long as you're balancing
it out with actually coding.

11
00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:47.047
Because you have to put your hands
on this stuff and build things.

12
00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.370
Otherwise, you don't know that you
actually know it even though you

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.412
might know about it.

14
00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:54.128
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it's all about deductive reasoning, right?

15
00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:58.391
To be able to learn something, the theory
of something and then extrapolate

16
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:03.130
that into being able to solve a different
kind of problem you've never seen.

17
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.988
So I'd recommend also like look
at some more simple websites and

18
00:01:08.988 --> 00:01:11.160
read the code for that.

19
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.864
And if you see something you aren't
sure how, like what it means,

20
00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:16.930
what it does, go for it, Google it.

21
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.595
And then there's a really
cool website called Dribbble,

22
00:01:20.595 --> 00:01:25.670
where designers can go post mock-ups for
things and designs for things.

23
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.954
So if you want to do like landing page.

24
00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:31.750
It's gonna make me sign in I think, okay.

25
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.559
Let's say you find a random landing page,
right?

26
00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:38.333
Take one of these designs and
see if you can code it.

27
00:01:38.333 --> 00:01:40.820
How would you start, right?

28
00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.950
&gt;&gt; What did you call that, the site?

29
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.830
&gt;&gt; It's called Dribbble.

30
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.040
It has one, two, three bs,
Dribbble with three bs.

31
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.991
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, what was that site
you mentioned that was good for

32
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:54.730
designing besides Figma,
you said it was interactive?

33
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.710
&gt;&gt; Framer X
&gt;&gt; Or Framer, I guess it's called now.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.035
So design and
ship your dream site, zero code.

35
00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:02.500
They're doing a lot of stuff.

36
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.782
Admittedly, I haven't looked at
what they've done in a while, but

37
00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:09.820
it looks pretty similar to Figma in many
ways, but you can export react components.

38
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.720
I definitely recommend checking them out.

39
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.010
&gt;&gt; That's frame what?

40
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.419
&gt;&gt; Framer, really good for
interactive prototyping.

41
00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:22.970
Okay.

42
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.922
&gt;&gt; There's a question.

43
00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:30.152
For CSS, would you start with Sass or
less for a small site?

44
00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:38.072
&gt;&gt; Me personally, I'm at the point where
I would start with CSS because for me,

45
00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:42.330
I can look at something now and
pull out the property value pairs.

46
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.130
If you're new and Sass is more comfortable
for you, I would say go for it.

47
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.690
I remember when I was learning Sass
in the beginning, so that stands for

48
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.200
Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets.

49
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.077
If you have not heard of Sass,
I'll bring up the website.

50
00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:02.818
It is a CSS preprocessor that gives
you the ability to create mixins or

51
00:03:02.818 --> 00:03:06.920
functions that you can include
in things or nest elements.

52
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.390
This was astronomically confusing for me.

53
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.850
I sat in my IBM training.

54
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.124
We had a boot camp and
they were just diving into Sass and

55
00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:17.770
I sat there like,
what the heck is going on?

56
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.890
I have no idea what's going on.

57
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.940
So, me personally, I always recommend
starting with the foundations.

58
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.190
I think it'll be a little
bit easier to pick up.

59
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.294
It's more primitive, and
then once you understand those things,

60
00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:29.883
Sass can be quite powerful
