1
00:00:00.026 --> 00:00:03.307
We're gonna chat about combinators now.

2
00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:08.127
And if this is a very heavy chapter
it is and I'm sorry for that.

3
00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:11.927
But this is probably gonna be the most
cognitively heavy one we're gonna work

4
00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:15.626
through, and then everything else will
be a little bit smoother sailing.

5
00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:16.744
So combinators,

6
00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:21.895
we can combine selectors in a way that
gives them relationship to other elements.

7
00:00:24.632 --> 00:00:29.589
So we've got this descendent selector,
that white space separated.

8
00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.851
It combines two selectors such that the
elements matched by the second selector

9
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:37.234
are selected if they have a parent
matching the first element.

10
00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:41.321
So in this example, it's gonna match
any link or anchor element that's

11
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:45.680
contained within a list item,
that's contained within an unordered list.

12
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.009
So it won't just match any
anchor element on the page.

13
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:54.672
&gt;&gt; Sorry, does that have any differences
when you're using the arrow key as well?

14
00:00:54.672 --> 00:00:55.424
&gt;&gt; Like the-
&gt;&gt; In

15
00:00:55.424 --> 00:00:56.002
between-
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

16
00:00:56.002 --> 00:00:57.732
&gt;&gt; Yes, we'll talk about that.

17
00:00:57.732 --> 00:01:00.293
Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

18
00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.628
So this is what this looks like.

19
00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.613
So we've got an unordered list, three
list items, each containing a link here.

20
00:01:05.613 --> 00:01:09.109
We've got our descendant selectors,
which are space separated here.

21
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:11.098
It's gonna say, color all those links red.

22
00:01:11.098 --> 00:01:15.656
And you'll notice,
we've also got a floating link down here.

23
00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:19.119
But this link is not contained within
a list item, within an unordered list, so

24
00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.251
that one's going to
maintain that black color.

25
00:01:23.795 --> 00:01:26.588
So that's a descendant selector.

26
00:01:26.588 --> 00:01:28.901
So this is probably what
you were referring to, TJ,

27
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:32.670
this direct descendant or child
combinator, it's that greater than symbol.

28
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.338
Was that what you were referring to?

29
00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:39.925
So this is a greater than symbol,
so it matches elements selected by

30
00:01:39.925 --> 00:01:45.167
the second selector who are direct
children elements of the first selector.

31
00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:49.867
So in this case it's gonna
match all paragraph elements

32
00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:54.667
that are direct children of
a div that has a class of text,

33
00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.975
so it won't style nested paragraphs.

34
00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:01.674
So if you bought like a div with
another div with a paragraph.

35
00:02:01.674 --> 00:02:04.962
And the second div does not
have that class of text,

36
00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:08.951
that paragraph will not be selected,
so here's an example.

37
00:02:08.951 --> 00:02:11.923
We've got our div with class of text,
we have a paragraph.

38
00:02:11.923 --> 00:02:16.878
We've got another div, no classes,
and a paragraph inside there.

39
00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:23.213
But again, we've got our direct
descendant selector or combinator here.

40
00:02:23.213 --> 00:02:27.187
Setting the font weight to bold, we can
see only the first paragraph has a font

41
00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.462
weight of bold because
it is a direct child.

42
00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:36.814
You might have seen a + symbol somewhere.

43
00:02:36.814 --> 00:02:42.490
So this is an adjacent sibling combinator,
so it matches the second element If

44
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:48.085
it immediately follows the first element
and they both have the same parent.

45
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:52.870
So in this case, we'll only select
a paragraph if it immediately

46
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.917
follows an image under that same parent.

47
00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:59.803
So this is what that looks like,
so we've got heading one,

48
00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:01.687
paragraph and a paragraph.

49
00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:05.780
We're saying select a paragraph
immediately follows a heading one,

50
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.105
give it a color of red.

51
00:03:11.175 --> 00:03:14.720
So only the first paragraph here is
colored red because it is an adjacent

52
00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720
sibling.

53
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.180
The second one is not an adjacent
sibling to that heading one.

54
00:03:24.422 --> 00:03:26.468
How about now?

55
00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:28.914
What is the style gonna look like on this?

56
00:03:28.914 --> 00:03:30.400
Anyone wanna guess?

57
00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:35.837
&gt;&gt; I think only the first paragraph.

58
00:03:35.837 --> 00:03:38.173
&gt;&gt; You think only the first paragraph?

59
00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:41.362
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because we have the + P, right?.

60
00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:46.295
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say none of
them are gonna turn red because

61
00:03:46.295 --> 00:03:48.879
the div comes after the h1.

62
00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:53.585
&gt;&gt; That's right, that was a good guess,
but that was correct, where none of

63
00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:58.232
them will have that color of red because
they have to have the same parent.

64
00:03:58.232 --> 00:04:02.585
And then lastly we've got this
general sibling combinator here.

65
00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:07.263
I believe this is called a tilde,
I don't know that's true, cool, tilde.

66
00:04:07.263 --> 00:04:10.143
I learned that from my dad when
I was a child and I was like,

67
00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:13.808
I will never need to know this
information, but now it's come in handy.

68
00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:17.390
So this matches all iterations of that
second element that are following

69
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.160
the first element, but they don't
have to immediately follow it, right?

70
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.851
So they have to have the same parent,
that's the only caveat.

71
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:26.095
So in this example,

72
00:04:26.095 --> 00:04:31.219
it would match all code elements that are
general siblings of a paragraph element,

73
00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:36.050
and they have that same parent,
so this is what that looks like.

74
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.426
We've got a paragraph,
two code elements, another paragraph,

75
00:04:39.426 --> 00:04:42.150
then we've got a div with
a code block inside of that.

76
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.859
So what does this look like?

77
00:04:44.859 --> 00:04:48.011
So only the first two code
blocks are gonna be red, right?

78
00:04:48.011 --> 00:04:52.673
Because they have the same
parent as the paragraph.

79
00:04:52.673 --> 00:04:56.482
So even though the second code block
defined on line three is not immediately

80
00:04:56.482 --> 00:05:00.411
following the paragraph, it's still
red because it's a general sibling and

81
00:05:00.411 --> 00:05:02.212
it's underneath the same parent.

82
00:05:02.212 --> 00:05:05.018
But that third code block is
wrapped inside of a div, so

83
00:05:05.018 --> 00:05:07.772
it has a different pair and
as a result will not be red.

84
00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:11.347
You probably won't use too many types
of combinators above, maybe the direct

85
00:05:11.347 --> 00:05:14.672
descendant one with a greater than symbol,
that one's pretty common.

86
00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:16.751
The other ones you might not see so
often, but

87
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:19.785
it's just good to recognize
a combinator when you see it.

88
00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:23.222
The combinators themselves don't add any
specificity in case anyone's wondering.

89
00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:27.026
The actual symbols don't add any weight
to the specificity calculation, but

90
00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:31.183
again if there's a class selector to the
right of the direct descendant combinator.

91
00:05:31.183 --> 00:05:34.605
Of course,
that class selector will have weight,

92
00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.319
just not the actual combinator symbol.

93
00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.916
&gt;&gt; What is the difference from
the greater than and the tilde?

94
00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:44.027
&gt;&gt; The greater than the tilde,
great question.

95
00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:50.130
So if we go back to this, the greater
than it is a direct descendant, right?

96
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.092
So we start at the right here.

97
00:05:54.092 --> 00:06:01.598
We wanna select all paragraphs, so long as
they are a direct child of this element.

98
00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:06.570
In this case, it's a div with a class of
text, so here we have a div class of text.

99
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.730
And this div has two direct children,
it's got a paragraph and a div, right?

100
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:13.377
When I say direct children,
I mean top-level.

101
00:06:13.377 --> 00:06:18.070
So this paragraph is not
a direct child of this div,

102
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:24.633
it's nested inside of another div,
so two top-level children here.

103
00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:29.852
This paragraph, this first one here on
line two, this is a direct descendant

104
00:06:29.852 --> 00:06:35.060
of this div, so that's why only
this first paragraph is bolded.

105
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.964
This second one is not
a direct descendant.

106
00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:41.490
When we talk about the tilde, it is a
general sibling, so it's not a descendant,

107
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.590
now we're dealing with siblings, so

108
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.428
they're gonna be elements
on the same level here.

109
00:06:46.428 --> 00:06:51.150
So these two code blocks on lines two and
three, these are siblings of each other.

110
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.720
The paragraph is also a sibling
of these code elements.

111
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.110
So, there are four siblings here,
we've got a paragraph, a code,

112
00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.533
another code, and a div.
All are siblings.

113
00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:04.441
This code block,
the third code block here,

114
00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:08.507
is a direct descendant of this
development, so it's a child.

115
00:07:08.507 --> 00:07:13.752
So we're talking about
siblings versus children.

116
00:07:13.752 --> 00:07:18.458
And a general sibling means,
hey, we're at the same level,

117
00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:22.091
we're on that same tree level,
essentially.

118
00:07:22.091 --> 00:07:25.227
I don't need to be next to
you to be a general sibling,

119
00:07:25.227 --> 00:07:28.529
I don't need to be next to you,
we're still siblings.

120
00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:32.757
If I have, let's say four brothers,
my fourth brother born later than me,

121
00:07:32.757 --> 00:07:34.418
is still my general sibling.

122
00:07:38.123 --> 00:07:42.782
So yeah, it's the difference between a
direct child and a general, like sibling.

123
00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.338
Does that make a little more sense?

124
00:07:44.338 --> 00:07:45.464
I know it's a little tricky.

125
00:07:45.464 --> 00:07:46.674
&gt;&gt; I've got you now, yep,

126
00:07:46.674 --> 00:07:49.993
I think I'm fine-
&gt;&gt; We won't be working with general

127
00:07:49.993 --> 00:07:54.693
siblings during our coding, but
it's just good to recognize and

128
00:07:54.693 --> 00:07:57.438
be like, that's a combinator.

129
00:07:57.438 --> 00:07:59.709
I need to look up what that means.

130
00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:05.645
&gt;&gt; There's a question around,
when would you use Flexbox versus Grid?

131
00:08:05.645 --> 00:08:09.061
&gt;&gt; Flexbox versus Grid, this is also
a very common interview question, so

132
00:08:09.061 --> 00:08:10.526
it's good to be aware of this.

133
00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:12.558
Flexbox is meant for
one-dimensional layouts.

134
00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:15.810
You can think of a navigation,
like in our design here.

135
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:19.255
You can see we've got a nav bar here,
we've got three links, and

136
00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:22.215
they all sit one-dimensionally
on that axis, right?

137
00:08:22.215 --> 00:08:27.436
So that's a great use case for Flexbox,
and we will use Flexbox for that.

138
00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:29.847
Grid is great for two-dimensional layouts.

139
00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:33.409
So that would be if we zoom out and
look at our entire homepage,

140
00:08:33.409 --> 00:08:35.063
this is two-dimensional.

141
00:08:35.063 --> 00:08:39.822
Cuz we've got that nav at the top,
and we've got a main content area,

142
00:08:39.822 --> 00:08:41.767
and we've got a button bar.

143
00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:44.695
So it's the difference between
a one-dimensional layout

144
00:08:44.695 --> 00:08:46.518
versus a two-dimensional layout.

145
00:08:46.518 --> 00:08:48.440
And you can use Flexbox within Grid and

146
00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:51.152
you absolutely should if you
have a use case for that.
