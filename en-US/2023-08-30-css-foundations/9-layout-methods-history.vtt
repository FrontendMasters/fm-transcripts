00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.588
This chapter is gonna cover all of the
topics needed for developing our header,

2
00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:07.239
let's take a look at
the history of CSS layouts.

3
00:00:08.324 --> 00:00:12.585
So back in the day when website
designs became more complicated,

4
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:17.710
we started seeing the table element being
used to layout elements on webpage.

5
00:00:19.773 --> 00:00:24.573
So if you were to get a design like the
one on the right with a page header and

6
00:00:24.573 --> 00:00:28.981
then you got sidebar and
mean side by side, and then a page footer,

7
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:33.346
it was pretty common to see the table
element being used for this.

8
00:00:33.346 --> 00:00:36.298
So they would use table header
to represent the page header and

9
00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:38.359
table body to represent sidebar and main.

10
00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.944
And it would have two table cells there
and table footer for page footer.

11
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.547
And that's why you might see table
with role= presentation in more

12
00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:50.940
legacy codebases.

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.752
So this is telling assistive technology,
like screen readers, hey,

14
00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:58.651
this is not actually a data table,

15
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:02.070
this is just being used to lay
out components on this web page.

16
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.323
But this was not great for
assistive technology because they weren't

17
00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:12.011
necessarily sure what was actually a data
table and what was just being used for

18
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.020
presentation.

19
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.174
So that's what this role of
presentation was aiming to do,

20
00:01:17.174 --> 00:01:20.010
was to tell screen reader, hey,
you don't need to read this out.

21
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.160
And then we saw the display property.

22
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:27.025
So this allowed us to change the display
value of an element from inline or

23
00:01:27.025 --> 00:01:32.810
block to inline block, for example,
which we'll learn about, right?

24
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.833
So if we had three navigation links in
these blocks and let's say we wanted

25
00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:42.791
them to sit together, well,
list items by default are block elements.

26
00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:47.181
And so you were seeing people set display
inline block and this said, okay,

27
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:51.445
well these are block elements but
I want them to be in line with each other.

28
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:57.412
But then the problem was like, okay, how
do we get these three elements to sit one

29
00:01:57.412 --> 00:02:00.691
next to each other so
there's not that white space in between.

30
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:04.186
And you would see things like margin,
right, -4 pixels.

31
00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:10.990
So this wasn't a great solution,
but it was a solution.

32
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.033
And then came floats, well, this worked
a little bit better than display inline

33
00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:20.940
block, but half the time floats didn't
work and nobody could figure out why.

34
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.340
Float's a property that places
the element to the right side or

35
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.010
the left side of its container, and it
just lets other elements wrap around it.

36
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.770
But it actually does remove that
element from the normal page flow.

37
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.351
So here's an example.

38
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:39.747
We've got an image here and
we've told it to float left.

39
00:02:39.747 --> 00:02:42.314
So float to the left
side of its container.

40
00:02:42.314 --> 00:02:45.932
We can see all those paragraphs
are floating around it, they wrap around.

41
00:02:48.227 --> 00:02:52.733
But sometimes if the containing element
was smaller, so you can see here on our

42
00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:57.443
dip we've set a height of 160 pixels,
but the image, it's taller than that,

43
00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:01.622
has a higher width, or I'm sorry,
a taller height than 160 pixels.

44
00:03:01.622 --> 00:03:04.230
So it's floating outside
the bounds of its container.

45
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.079
So positioning elements with
floats is pretty tricky, and

46
00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.982
we're not gonna cover exactly
how to work with floats,

47
00:03:11.982 --> 00:03:15.643
it's a little bit outdated at this point,
but this was one solution.
