00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
So this was a lot.

2
00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.832
Let's be honest,

3
00:00:02.832 --> 00:00:07.140
people have this misconception
perhaps CSS is not too difficult.

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.360
And the reality is the syntax is
quite easy to understand, right?

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.979
But there's a lot going on, especially
when you start with a high fidelity mock

6
00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.610
up and you have no idea how to begin.

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.150
So where can you go from here?

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.202
There are many Frontend
Master's courses on CSS,

9
00:00:21.202 --> 00:00:24.460
getting started with CSS by Jen Kramer.

10
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.790
There's Dynamic CSS with
Custom Properties with Lea Verou.

11
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.900
She's also written a fantastic
book as well that I can recommend.

12
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.260
There's a CSS Animations and Transitions
course, which I'm certain is super fun.

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.508
We've got Sass Fundamentals as well if
you're looking to get into Sass, right?

14
00:00:44.508 --> 00:00:48.710
If this were me and I was really trying
to improve my CSS and become more

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.130
of an expert, I would maybe dive into
more animations, learn more about

16
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.058
preprocessors, maybe some CSS frameworks
like Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation,

17
00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:04.050
and maybe even design systems which are a
whole ecosystem that are so fun to learn.

18
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.130
So this is where I might go.

19
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.130
Just a couple of resources
I'd love to share.

20
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.739
If you're going to be playing around,
building your websites,

21
00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:16.820
these are some sites that I found
are great for assets and getting things.

22
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.565
So I've used Unsplash for
all of the images in this course.

23
00:01:20.565 --> 00:01:23.780
And they are linked in
the readme of the repository.

24
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.466
Unsplash, you can search for
different images and

25
00:01:26.466 --> 00:01:30.728
use them of course if you're gonna be
using them proprietarily, is that a word?

26
00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:33.349
If you're gonna be using
them in production,

27
00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:37.989
I would perhaps look into the legality of
what you need to do officious crediting,

28
00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:42.480
the photographer or if it's paying for
but fantastic website.

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.210
Again, I mentioned
dribbble with three B's.

30
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.990
So, design portfolios.

31
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.863
It's great for finding mock ups if you
wanna like practice your CSS a fantastic

32
00:01:50.863 --> 00:01:52.340
place to get mock-ups from.

33
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.710
Grid Generator from Sarah Drazner,
again, super fun to play with.

34
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.152
And if you're interested in learning
more about Flexbox and Grid and

35
00:02:01.152 --> 00:02:05.185
practicing them, Grid Garden is a really
fun game where you've got this grid and

36
00:02:05.185 --> 00:02:09.040
little plants and you have to figure out
how the code that you would write to get

37
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.040
them in the right locations.

38
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.790
Same for Flexbox Froggy.

39
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.592
I really appreciate all the help in
the participation today, and thank you for

40
00:02:16.592 --> 00:02:17.520
sticking with me.

41
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.919
If you have questions,
feel free to message me.

42
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:25.460
And with that, I wish you the best
on your programming journey.

43
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.750
