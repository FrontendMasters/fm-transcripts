1
00:00:00.228 --> 00:00:03.659
How do we go from this to this?

2
00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.491
This is a lot, right?

3
00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:12.072
The good news is the markup looks the same
for all of these different blocks, right?

4
00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:14.024
Let's look at what that looks like.

5
00:00:14.024 --> 00:00:18.799
We've got a div, inside that div,
we've got an image, an h2 for

6
00:00:18.799 --> 00:00:24.109
the name, a paragraph for the company
name, and a paragraph for the bio.

7
00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.400
So all the markup looks the same.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.565
So hopefully,
it's not too terrible to try and style.

9
00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:30.561
When we do one,
it should be applied to all of them.

10
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.010
I'm gonna add some class names so
that these are easier to work with.

11
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.555
First of all, let me collapse this SVG,
cuz this is a large block of code here.

12
00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:47.721
Again, I'm gonna use multi-select,
the cursor, multi-cursor, in VSCode,

13
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:51.304
because since the markup is the same,
it's gonna save us a ton of time.

14
00:00:51.304 --> 00:00:55.913
So what I want to do first, I wanna add
a class to these wrapping divs here.

15
00:00:55.913 --> 00:00:58.383
So I'm gonna highlight this.

16
00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:03.039
Full tag, I'm gonna hit Cmd+D,
one, two, three,

17
00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.505
four, I think there's another one,
five, five.

18
00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.904
And now I can multi-type at the same time.

19
00:01:09.904 --> 00:01:13.735
So class, and
this is gonna be speaker__wrapper.

20
00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:21.086
Let's do the same thing for
the image, so img,

21
00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:24.006
multi-select five times.

22
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:30.075
Give it a class of, speaker__photo.

23
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:41.002
Same thing for, The h2.

24
00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:51.806
I'm gonna call these ones speaker__name,
and then we've got company and bio.

25
00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:57.444
In order to multi-select these, because if
you're playing around with multi-select,

26
00:01:57.444 --> 00:01:58.611
it can be a little tricky, right?

27
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:01.058
I wanna select all of
the company paragraphs, but

28
00:02:01.058 --> 00:02:03.456
the bio ones underneath
it will also match that.

29
00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:07.687
So I'm gonna select the entire
opening paragraph element plus that C,

30
00:02:07.687 --> 00:02:10.447
that I'll give us
the company elements only.

31
00:02:10.447 --> 00:02:13.523
Yeah, multi-select here,

32
00:02:13.523 --> 00:02:19.678
class="speaker__company", and
lastly, the bio.

33
00:02:19.678 --> 00:02:25.146
[SOUND]
Okay,

34
00:02:28.968 --> 00:02:31.162
Whoo-hoo, okay, now,
we can actually apply some styles.

35
00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:35.537
So our images, looking at our file here,

36
00:02:35.537 --> 00:02:39.668
should have a size of 310 by 310.

37
00:02:39.668 --> 00:02:44.601
So let's go ahead in our speakers.css
file, let's close out the others here.

38
00:02:47.477 --> 00:02:53.235
.speaker__photo, width:

39
00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:58.355
310, height: 310.

40
00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.651
Okay, that's a little bit
easier to work with here.

41
00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:04.879
You'll notice some of our
photos are distorted, right?

42
00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.620
Anyone know why they might be distorted?

43
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.095
It's just that the dimensions with
the photo don't match what we're trying

44
00:03:11.095 --> 00:03:12.653
to fit it into box-wise, right?

45
00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:15.530
Just fine, but there are some
properties that we can use to fix this.

46
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.703
So there's a property called
object-fit that we can use.

47
00:03:18.703 --> 00:03:22.260
So let's go in here, object-fit.

48
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.902
Let's try contain, remember,
from our cat photo.

49
00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:25.958
What does contain do?

50
00:03:25.958 --> 00:03:29.897
It tries to maintain those dimensions
here, but some of them, again,

51
00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:32.800
it's just not looking right,
so let's try cover.

52
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.376
Let's see what cover does.

53
00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:37.141
Well, that looks a little bit better.

54
00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:40.044
They're now 310 by 310,
although there are a few,

55
00:03:40.044 --> 00:03:43.668
you can see this one here, this one here,
the heads are cut off, right?

56
00:03:43.668 --> 00:03:44.408
So how do we fix that?

57
00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:47.919
&gt;&gt; Aspect ratio?

58
00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:52.830
&gt;&gt; I guess you probably could use that.

59
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.648
&gt;&gt; What if you remove the heights,
you just probably use the width or

60
00:03:57.648 --> 00:03:58.704
the heights?

61
00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.311
&gt;&gt; If I remove height here?

62
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:01.659
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just one.

63
00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.323
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, except they're all
gonna be different ratio.

64
00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:06.856
So here's the reality.

65
00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:11.751
The ideal situation is our photos are
given to us in the dimensions that we need

66
00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:15.081
them, that's the ideal situation,
[LAUGH] right?

67
00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:17.773
If we don't have an explicit height,
they're all gonna be different heights.

68
00:04:17.773 --> 00:04:19.489
So we do want that height.

69
00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.376
Aspect ratio might actually work,
I didn't think about that.

70
00:04:27.813 --> 00:04:29.907
I'm curious.

71
00:04:29.907 --> 00:04:35.239
Let's see, aspect ratio, uh-huh, 1/1.

72
00:04:35.239 --> 00:04:37.162
Let's see what that does.

73
00:04:37.162 --> 00:04:39.976
Admittedly, I haven't used
aspect ratio before, so

74
00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:42.553
let's see what happens if
we add it on this class.

75
00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:48.185
aspect-ratio: 1/1, let's see,
does that do anything?

76
00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:51.258
I guess if I remove cover.

77
00:04:51.258 --> 00:04:58.723
Okay, so the ratio here,
I don't know, was 16/9, how do you?

78
00:04:58.723 --> 00:04:59.935
Is it a fraction only?

79
00:05:01.607 --> 00:05:02.967
Yeah, it looks like it.

80
00:05:02.967 --> 00:05:04.941
You probably could use aspect ratio.

81
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:06.505
That's the short answer.

82
00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:09.161
The long answer is I haven't
worked with it before.

83
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:14.922
So I'm gonna stick to object-fit and
position them that way.

84
00:05:14.922 --> 00:05:17.982
That was a really good point.

85
00:05:17.982 --> 00:05:21.090
We can use the object position value or

86
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.863
property value pair to go ahead and
center these, right?

87
00:05:25.863 --> 00:05:31.684
Looking at our photos, let's see,
the third one here, And

88
00:05:31.684 --> 00:05:33.905
the fifth one here,
we need to fix those two.

89
00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:36.266
Those are the two we need to worry about.

90
00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:39.088
So in this instance, I'm sure
there are several other solutions.

91
00:05:39.088 --> 00:05:41.204
What I'm gonna do is add
another class to these.

92
00:05:43.428 --> 00:05:52.000
I'm gonna set that to speaker__photo--top.

93
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.058
It's gonna be our modifier here,

94
00:05:55.058 --> 00:05:59.286
cuz I want the photo to
be positioned at the top.

95
00:05:59.286 --> 00:06:03.271
Let's add it to the last one as well
since the head was being cut off there.

96
00:06:03.271 --> 00:06:09.768
Now, in here, .speaker__photo--top.

97
00:06:09.768 --> 00:06:12.848
Before I do this,
let's set that on all the photos and

98
00:06:12.848 --> 00:06:15.867
see why we can't just apply
it to the speaker class.

99
00:06:15.867 --> 00:06:20.880
Oopsie, here we go, object-position: top.

100
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.211
If I do that, this looks much better.

101
00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:27.856
But this is not looking so hot,
these are a little bit cut off.

102
00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:34.384
We want them to be appropriately
centered or positioned, right?

103
00:06:34.384 --> 00:06:36.807
So it's just those two that
we really wanna alter.

104
00:06:36.807 --> 00:06:43.078
So I'm only gonna set it on those two,
object-position: top.

105
00:06:43.078 --> 00:06:48.908
Okay, so now, did I save my HTML?

106
00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:52.255
I did, so it's not showing up, hold on.

107
00:06:52.255 --> 00:06:55.600
I put it on the wrong person,
that's why, silly.

108
00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:03.980
So it was the third and the last.

109
00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:04.892
Let me fix that.

110
00:07:13.435 --> 00:07:19.253
Okay, there we go, [SOUND] there we go.

111
00:07:19.253 --> 00:07:21.764
Okey-dokey, that looks
a little bit better,

112
00:07:21.764 --> 00:07:24.543
we can see everyone's shining faces here,
right?

113
00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:26.326
But, like I mentioned, ideally,

114
00:07:26.326 --> 00:07:29.545
these photos would be in the proper
aspect ratio for you before.

115
00:07:29.545 --> 00:07:31.285
Sometimes this happens and
you gotta play with it.

116
00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:37.026
Okay, now we've got the name
of the company in the bio.

117
00:07:39.672 --> 00:07:43.753
So the name, again,
these are all in the design files.

118
00:07:43.753 --> 00:07:45.295
We want it to be 32 pixels.

119
00:07:47.743 --> 00:07:52.513
Speaker__name, font-size: 32px, speaker,

120
00:07:52.513 --> 00:07:57.903
we'll add the style rules for
the company and the bio as well,

121
00:07:57.903 --> 00:08:02.685
because they're gonna be pretty similar,
company.

122
00:08:04.507 --> 00:08:07.550
Speaker__bio, okay?

123
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.767
So the name we want 32 pixels, the company
has 24 pixels, and the bio is 20.

124
00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:24.167
Okay, cool,
that's looking a little bit more like our,

125
00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:27.971
what is it called, our design file, right?

126
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:32.548
But of course, the text here is inheriting
that orange color from the body secondary

127
00:08:32.548 --> 00:08:33.456
class, right?

128
00:08:33.456 --> 00:08:37.892
This is fine for our speaker name, which
we want to be orange, but our company and

129
00:08:37.892 --> 00:08:39.538
our bio, we want to be black.

130
00:08:39.538 --> 00:08:44.617
So I'm gonna go ahead,
in our base file here,

131
00:08:44.617 --> 00:08:49.894
let's do, One more variable here.

132
00:08:49.894 --> 00:08:55.848
So we have color-text-on-primary, it'll be
nice if we get color-text-on-secondary.

133
00:08:55.848 --> 00:09:00.133
So I'll just make one more,
--color-text-on-secondary, and

134
00:09:00.133 --> 00:09:01.666
we want this to be black.

135
00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:07.834
So black hex value is 000000, like that.

136
00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:09.480
I'm gonna copy this variable name.

137
00:09:12.659 --> 00:09:15.815
Now, what I could do for the company and

138
00:09:15.815 --> 00:09:20.512
bio is put the color declarations
on both of them, right?

139
00:09:20.512 --> 00:09:22.121
So that's totally valid.

140
00:09:22.121 --> 00:09:27.401
If I want to avoid that, what I can do
then is just combine these two selectors,

141
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:30.522
so speaker__company and speaker__bio.

142
00:09:30.522 --> 00:09:32.071
Maybe this is a better solution.

143
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.196
I mean, it's kind of a small example,
so honestly,

144
00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:38.122
it doesn't really make
that big of a difference.

145
00:09:38.122 --> 00:09:41.140
But just to switch things up,
we'll do it that way,

146
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.345
except that this one's not working.

147
00:09:43.345 --> 00:09:47.081
speaker__bio is still orange.

148
00:09:47.081 --> 00:09:49.361
Let's see, what's our bug counter?

149
00:09:49.361 --> 00:09:53.046
How many live bugs are we
up to at this point?

150
00:09:53.046 --> 00:09:54.820
That's me being silly.

151
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:58.889
I wrote company__bio in the markup and
not speaker__bio.

152
00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:02.710
Let's fix that, speaker_bio, there we go.

153
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.423
At least that one was relatively painless.

154
00:10:07.195 --> 00:10:12.367
Okay, so very much like how we
previously had to remove margin off of

155
00:10:12.367 --> 00:10:18.197
the paragraph elements, remember,
we removed that on the home page here.

156
00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:22.111
We also wanna remove it
from the heading element,

157
00:10:22.111 --> 00:10:26.408
because this header has
some default margin, right?

158
00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:28.215
You can see that in our
box model down here.

159
00:10:28.215 --> 00:10:32.418
So what we're gonna do is also just
remove it from the header elements, oops,

160
00:10:32.418 --> 00:10:34.023
like that, to combine that.

161
00:10:34.023 --> 00:10:37.605
So now,
that's sitting a little bit more flushed.

162
00:10:37.605 --> 00:10:41.271
Now, we do wanna have some
spacing between these elements.

163
00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:49.538
It is in our design file here,
there is a red line.

164
00:10:49.538 --> 00:10:53.943
So 36 px between the name and image,
20 between name and company, and

165
00:10:53.943 --> 00:10:55.799
32 between company and bio.

166
00:10:55.799 --> 00:11:00.348
Now, there are a couple ways
that we could do this, right?

167
00:11:00.348 --> 00:11:04.886
So we could add top and
bottom margin to the speaker name and

168
00:11:04.886 --> 00:11:07.393
then bottom margin to company.

169
00:11:07.393 --> 00:11:10.593
We could add bottom margin to the photo,
bottom margin to speaker name,

170
00:11:10.593 --> 00:11:11.804
bottom margin to company.

171
00:11:11.804 --> 00:11:14.559
There are several different
ways you can go about this, and

172
00:11:14.559 --> 00:11:17.493
I'm not sure which is necessarily
considered best practice.

173
00:11:17.493 --> 00:11:21.930
What I'm going to do is add bottom
margin to these three elements.

174
00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:22.921
Is it the right solution?

175
00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:24.517
I don't know, it works.

176
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.047
If you have a strong opinion,
please let me know,

177
00:11:27.047 --> 00:11:29.955
because actually I'm not
certain where I stand on this.

178
00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:30.874
I'm curious where y'all do.

179
00:11:30.874 --> 00:11:34.304
So back to the speaker photo.

180
00:11:34.304 --> 00:11:36.952
Let's go back to the photo, okay?

181
00:11:36.952 --> 00:11:42.681
margin-bottom: 36, I lied to you.

182
00:11:42.681 --> 00:11:49.953
The name is 20, margin-bottom: 20,
and then company is 32.

183
00:11:56.427 --> 00:11:58.725
Nice, we also need to set
a width on the card so

184
00:11:58.725 --> 00:12:01.462
that our content's not
getting super-duper long.

185
00:12:01.462 --> 00:12:04.139
You can see our text is
just continuing on and on.

186
00:12:04.139 --> 00:12:07.343
And actually the longer your paragraph
text is, the more difficult it is for

187
00:12:07.343 --> 00:12:09.161
people to read, it's not as accessible.

188
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.981
So it is good to set a width on there.

189
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.776
I could set the width on
the paragraph content.

190
00:12:13.776 --> 00:12:17.193
I'm gonna actually set it on
the wrapper for the speaker.

191
00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:19.448
So where did you go?

192
00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:22.235
Speaker wrapper,
maybe I haven't defined that in here yet.

193
00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:27.681
Okay, we'll put it up here,
.speaker__wrapper.

194
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:30.504
Let's set a width on here.

195
00:12:30.504 --> 00:12:31.896
Let's set it to 460.

196
00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:33.954
Let's see how that looks.

197
00:12:33.954 --> 00:12:36.839
Okay, looks a little bit better here.

198
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:43.336
So the entire wrapper has
now a width of 460, right?

199
00:12:43.336 --> 00:12:46.495
We also want the speaker
cards to be in a grid.

200
00:12:46.495 --> 00:12:49.917
If we look at our design,
it's a 2 by 2 grid, right?

201
00:12:53.646 --> 00:12:57.155
So we could use grid, but
we can also use flexbox, right?

202
00:12:57.155 --> 00:13:00.233
It does look like a two-dimensional
layout, but actually,

203
00:13:00.233 --> 00:13:04.136
if we think about it, it kind of is a one
dimensional layout where the flex items

204
00:13:04.136 --> 00:13:05.925
just wrap onto new lines as needed.

205
00:13:05.925 --> 00:13:08.420
I think that's the least.

206
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:10.985
I think you could use grid,
absolutely, but

207
00:13:10.985 --> 00:13:13.630
I think flexbox also makes
a lot of sense here.

208
00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.483
So, We scroll back up here.

209
00:13:17.483 --> 00:13:18.531
We can see right now,

210
00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:22.154
we have each individual speaker wrapper
at that same level as our header.

211
00:13:22.154 --> 00:13:26.716
So what I'm gonna do just to kind of to
encapsulate all of the speaker cards in

212
00:13:26.716 --> 00:13:31.875
one place, we'll create a div, and we'll
give it a class of speakers__wrapper.

213
00:13:31.875 --> 00:13:33.355
Now, this is different
than speaker__wrapper.

214
00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:35.349
I know it's pretty close.

215
00:13:35.349 --> 00:13:38.274
Let's see if I get any bugs there.

216
00:13:38.274 --> 00:13:41.682
Okay, so now,
they're in their own wrapping div, right?

217
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:47.567
And now, if we wanna lay them out,
speakers_wrapper,

218
00:13:47.567 --> 00:13:51.271
let's make that a flex container,
display: flex.

219
00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:56.668
And now, they're all in one line,
cuz remember,

220
00:13:56.668 --> 00:13:59.205
they try to fit on one
line as flex elements.

221
00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:01.053
Well, we want them to wrap
like I had mentioned.

222
00:14:01.053 --> 00:14:05.721
So let's try to make them wrap,
flex-wrap: wrap.

223
00:14:05.721 --> 00:14:08.707
Cool, they're gonna break onto a new line
when there's not enough space for them.

224
00:14:08.707 --> 00:14:10.353
They're gonna maintain
their width of what?

225
00:14:10.353 --> 00:14:12.692
I think it was 460, something like that.

226
00:14:12.692 --> 00:14:13.641
It's a little bit better.

227
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:16.526
It's not exactly what we're looking for.

228
00:14:16.526 --> 00:14:21.705
If we inspect this here,
here's our speakers__wrapper.

229
00:14:21.705 --> 00:14:23.944
If you can see, if we hover over it,

230
00:14:23.944 --> 00:14:27.251
there's kind of a bunch of
space on the right there.

231
00:14:27.251 --> 00:14:28.831
This is where we can use justify-content.

232
00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:35.314
We kind of want some space in between, so
justify-content: space-between, right?

233
00:14:35.314 --> 00:14:39.094
And so now, we're getting that purple,
it's almost like a channel,

234
00:14:39.094 --> 00:14:41.561
it's the space that's
leftover on that row.

235
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:43.658
It's gonna be in the middle of them.

236
00:14:43.658 --> 00:14:46.712
But maybe we do want to use grid, right?

237
00:14:46.712 --> 00:14:48.333
How do you know?

238
00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:51.000
If we go back to Grid Generator for
a second here,

239
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.938
we know that we wanna have two columns,
we know that.

240
00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:56.350
We want two columns
with a grid gap of 200,

241
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:59.474
we want 200 pixels of space between them,
let's say.

242
00:14:59.474 --> 00:15:02.239
We don't want them to be right
on top of each other, right?

243
00:15:02.239 --> 00:15:04.660
There's some space there.

244
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.788
So we add a grid column gap of 200 here,
right, maybe something like that.

245
00:15:09.788 --> 00:15:13.414
I don't really care about how
many rows there are as long as

246
00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:16.305
the items are filling
up the available space.

247
00:15:16.305 --> 00:15:18.418
So what does that look like?

248
00:15:18.418 --> 00:15:20.653
Well, maybe we should try it.

249
00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:27.210
If we have a display: grid,
right, we want two columns.

250
00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.954
I don't care about the number of rows, but
we do want that column gap of 200 pixels.

251
00:15:31.954 --> 00:15:35.545
We also want the items to
have some row gap as well.

252
00:15:35.545 --> 00:15:38.927
We don't want the items to sit immediately
on top of each other vertically.

253
00:15:38.927 --> 00:15:43.932
So let's give it a row gap as well of,
let's say, 120 pixels.

254
00:15:43.932 --> 00:15:47.762
I want it to be 120 pixels, and that's
what I have on my notes and my screenshot,

255
00:15:47.762 --> 00:15:48.440
and it works.

256
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.437
But for some reason, maybe I had
a larger monitor before, [LAUGH] and

257
00:15:53.437 --> 00:15:56.169
so the window wasn't so scrunched.

258
00:15:56.169 --> 00:16:03.564
You know what,
we're gonna try 120 in our, In our code.

259
00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:05.294
But I might have to wing it,
let's see what happens.

260
00:16:05.294 --> 00:16:10.156
I'm gonna copy this code, right?

261
00:16:10.156 --> 00:16:14.728
So in our speakers__wrapper, Let's

262
00:16:14.728 --> 00:16:19.377
change this to display: grid, right?

263
00:16:19.377 --> 00:16:23.794
Remember, we want two columns taking
up one fraction each, column gap.

264
00:16:23.794 --> 00:16:27.733
Remember, I don't care how many rows there
are, just fill up all the available space.

265
00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:31.495
We want the column gap to be 200,
and I wanted this to be 120.

266
00:16:31.495 --> 00:16:35.614
Now, I'm scared to go back to my browser,
but let's see what happens.

267
00:16:35.614 --> 00:16:38.003
Yeah, I think it was just a matter of,

268
00:16:38.003 --> 00:16:43.100
I'm on a smaller viewport with my MacBook
and I have my nice big monitor, right?

269
00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:47.438
So now,
we've got our 120 pixel gap between rows.

270
00:16:47.438 --> 00:16:48.049
We can see this.

271
00:16:48.049 --> 00:16:52.364
If we hover over this in Chrome,
you can see the actual gaps, the column,

272
00:16:52.364 --> 00:16:53.971
and row gaps here, right?

273
00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:55.790
So actually,
maybe grid is a better solution.

274
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:59.094
We definitely could use flexbox,
there's nothing wrong with that,

275
00:16:59.094 --> 00:17:01.396
but it seems like maybe
grid is the way to go here.

276
00:17:05.071 --> 00:17:08.161
So now, you can see we get
exactly two photos per row,

277
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:10.028
they maintain a nice distance.

278
00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:16.327
When we resize the window, though,
that's not very nice, right?

279
00:17:16.327 --> 00:17:20.634
That's because we've defined a finite
width on these cards, right?

280
00:17:20.634 --> 00:17:24.069
So instead of using width,
let's say, max-width.

281
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:28.274
I wanna say the maximum width these
cards will be is 460 pixels, right?

282
00:17:28.274 --> 00:17:31.763
So now, instead of having
that overflow on the x-axis,

283
00:17:31.763 --> 00:17:35.851
now they're squishier up to
a certain point, of course, right?

284
00:17:35.851 --> 00:17:38.454
They're a little bit squishier and
more responsive.

285
00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:41.664
They won't be any wider than 460 pixels,
but

286
00:17:41.664 --> 00:17:44.261
they do squish up into a certain point.
