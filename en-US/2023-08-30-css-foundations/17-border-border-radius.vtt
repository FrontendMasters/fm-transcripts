00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.570
Real quick, let's talk about border.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.365
I'm gonna fly through these a little bit
because the documentation is extremely

3
00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:08.228
comprehensive and in reality,
we're not gonna use it all.

4
00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:12.170
Border, again, in the box model,
its content, padding and border.

5
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.590
There are many different border
styles that you can use.

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.534
Here's what they look like as according
to the Mozilla Developer Network,

7
00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.560
I've linked that page
feel free to click it.

8
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.100
We've got dotted, dashed,
solid, etc., yes?

9
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.750
&gt;&gt; What do you advise to use?

10
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.430
Border, box size or div?

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.990
Styling div to look exactly
like border as well.

12
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.920
&gt;&gt; I would never personally style
a div to look like a border.

13
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.770
I would always use border or outline.

14
00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.260
Outline is another good one.

15
00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.160
Outline is not going to push
other elements away from it, so

16
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.820
it'll lay on top of anything around it.

17
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.310
But if it's just for visual sake,
use the properties that exist in CSS.

18
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.390
If it's for a semantic content markup,
use an element.

19
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.890
We can also define border width.

20
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.840
We can do that with pixels.

21
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.062
We can do that with point, I honestly
have never really seen point used.

22
00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:11.300
I don't really see the keywords used very
often I mostly see border in pixels.

23
00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.610
And this again,
links to the Mozilla Developer Network.

24
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.690
You can go play with it there.

25
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.705
There's of course border
color that we can set.

26
00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:22.564
We can use name colors, hex, RGB.

27
00:01:22.564 --> 00:01:24.580
We've talked about these
in a previous chapter.

28
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.220
And then you can set the style
of different border sides.

29
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.500
This is interesting for
creating nice visual designs.

30
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.940
We'll see that in a second.

31
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.370
But again, there is a border shorthand.

32
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.761
So, instead of saying border style,
border width, border color,

33
00:01:36.761 --> 00:01:38.231
you just use border, right?

34
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:41.625
So, these two rules are doing
the same exact thing, but

35
00:01:41.625 --> 00:01:46.263
instead of defining three rules we can
define just one with that shorthand.

36
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:52.572
Can also define border radius
which takes these sharp edges and

37
00:01:52.572 --> 00:01:57.500
turns them into more soft curves that
takes a pixel or a percentage value.

38
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.976
So border radius here we see
30 pixels on all four sides.

39
00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.940
These are taken from Mozilla Developer
Network as well, the docs there.

40
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.099
Border radius here, we're setting top and
bottom border radius to be 25%,

41
00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.962
actually, I'm confused about these now.

42
00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:16.400
I'm getting myself all confused.

43
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.788
It starts top left and
goes clockwise, right?

44
00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:24.511
So all four values here, like we're
seeing top left is 10%, top right is 30,

45
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:27.018
bottom right is 50, bottom left is 70.

46
00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:30.147
You can get these fun
little squishy shapes.

47
00:02:30.147 --> 00:02:33.380
I have to check what these two values are.

48
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.980
You know what?
Let's check it together.

49
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.242
We only have to find two.

50
00:02:37.242 --> 00:02:37.921
Where does it go?

51
00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:45.271
These are box, yeah, so
it's gonna be top left, bottom right,

52
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:47.798
and then top right, bottom left.

53
00:02:47.798 --> 00:02:52.846
Kinda confusing, but this documentation
is very comprehensive, so

54
00:02:52.846 --> 00:02:58.505
go ahead and play around with that if
you're interested in more in depth border
