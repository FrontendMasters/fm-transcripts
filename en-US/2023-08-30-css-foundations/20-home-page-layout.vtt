00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
Let's finish up building our home page,
right?

2
00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.249
We've got our header.

3
00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:04.263
That looks good.

4
00:00:04.263 --> 00:00:08.151
Let's finish up here with the title.

5
00:00:08.151 --> 00:00:09.443
I don't know what I call this.

6
00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:10.528
Jumbotron, maybe?

7
00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:15.141
I don't know if that's like an outdated
term, but making up my own words today.

8
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:19.395
The subtitle here and the two buttons.

9
00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:24.490
So let's continue with our BEM naming
architecture, our block element modifier.

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.428
Let's start with the main section here.

11
00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:30.541
I'm going to give it a class of main.

12
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.340
It's a little redundant, but
we're rolling with it for now.

13
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.524
I'm going to call this main heading.

14
00:00:36.524 --> 00:00:40.138
That's an element main_heading.

15
00:00:40.138 --> 00:00:47.178
I'll call this main_sub-heading,
Sub-heading.

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.278
And we'll leave it at that for right now.

17
00:00:55.432 --> 00:00:59.657
I am missing a button, so
I'm going to be a little sneaky here.

18
00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:05.050
Grab it from here, and
then pretend that it already existed.

19
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.065
It's our contact button.

20
00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:09.680
Come back to this.

21
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.030
You didn't see anything, okay?

22
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.510
So if we looked at our design again,
our title here,

23
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.635
I guess it's defined in the style
palette over here, right?

24
00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:23.950
Yeah, look at me calling things jumbotron,
who am I?

25
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.233
This is the heading and subheading.

26
00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:31.935
Rename you so
everyone is on the same page heading

27
00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:36.674
120 pixels, sub-heading as 40.

28
00:01:36.674 --> 00:01:38.197
Maybe it means this hard.

29
00:01:41.278 --> 00:01:44.373
Okay, sub-heading.

30
00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:48.062
So 128 and 40 are the pixel
values we're working with here.

31
00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:51.613
So back over here,
let's go to our index file.

32
00:01:51.613 --> 00:01:55.432
Now we're gonna be coding in our index
file because this is pertinent only

33
00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:56.363
to the home page.

34
00:01:56.363 --> 00:02:01.117
So main_heading, font size 128,

35
00:02:01.117 --> 00:02:06.733
I am also gonna give this
a font weight of bold,

36
00:02:06.733 --> 00:02:09.770
so it really stands out.

37
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.175
That is definitely big, so it worked.

38
00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:20.956
Our sub-heading, our font size was sporty.

39
00:02:20.956 --> 00:02:23.251
So looking good.

40
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:28.052
Now, you'll notice that our main content
is pushed up against the viewport edge on

41
00:02:28.052 --> 00:02:32.456
like our heading or, yeah, our header
element that has some padding here.

42
00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:34.009
So we'll go ahead and

43
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:39.289
add some padding on to the main element
as well to be consistent padding.

44
00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:41.319
Okay, give it some padding.

45
00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.954
Cool, looks good.

46
00:02:47.427 --> 00:02:51.210
Looks like yeah, if you inspect and
figma you can hold,

47
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.637
you can highlight, click on an element and
click Option on Mac and

48
00:02:55.637 --> 00:02:59.444
it'll show you the space so
that's why I chose 150.

49
00:02:59.444 --> 00:03:03.527
So you'll also notice if we inspect here,
the heading element,

50
00:03:03.527 --> 00:03:06.508
what we've defined, it's a paragraph here.

51
00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:08.848
It has some margin on the top and bottom.

52
00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:13.812
You can see it has 128 pixels top and
bottom margin.

53
00:03:13.812 --> 00:03:16.608
This is set on paragraphs in
the user agent style sheet.

54
00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:18.049
So I'm gonna remove that and

55
00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.183
I'm gonna remove that in the base
file just to be consistent.

56
00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:22.415
I'll put it up at the top here.

57
00:03:22.415 --> 00:03:29.650
So for all paragraphs, I don't want
any margin set up on there, right?

58
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.033
So that's a little bit better.

59
00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:36.879
Now I'm not getting this massive space
between our sub-heading and heading.

60
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.953
Okay, let's style our button elements now.

61
00:03:38.953 --> 00:03:44.213
So by default,
you can tell our button elements have some

62
00:03:44.213 --> 00:03:49.482
styling stung by the user agent but
I want to remove that.

63
00:03:49.482 --> 00:03:54.698
So the first thing that we will do,
I will do this in the base

64
00:03:54.698 --> 00:04:00.984
class because buttons are not
necessarily specific to the homepage.

65
00:04:00.984 --> 00:04:03.330
I think they are in this design,
but we'll do it in here.

66
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.567
So firstly, let's go ahead and
give these some classes so

67
00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.354
we can style them using
our naming architecture.

68
00:04:09.354 --> 00:04:11.254
So we'll do a class of button.

69
00:04:11.254 --> 00:04:14.671
We'll also, well,
I'm gonna come back to that.

70
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:15.767
We'll give it a class of button.

71
00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:16.775
We'll leave it at that.

72
00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:19.663
I'll copy and paste on to the second one.

73
00:04:19.663 --> 00:04:24.017
Okay, in our base file,
let's style our button.

74
00:04:24.017 --> 00:04:27.289
So we'll give it a font size of 32 pixels.

75
00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.158
All these values are coming
from our design doc.

76
00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:32.699
I'm going to stop switching back and
forth just to save some time, but

77
00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.373
that's where I'm getting all these
values from if you're wondering.

78
00:04:36.373 --> 00:04:40.871
We want to add some padding in here as
well, so the button has some space.

79
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:42.319
You can see the width and

80
00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:46.026
height of the contact's button
is really right up on there.

81
00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:47.443
So we're going to give it some padding.

82
00:04:47.443 --> 00:04:50.982
We'll do no top and bottom padding, but

83
00:04:50.982 --> 00:04:55.778
we'll add some left and
right padding of 64 pixels.

84
00:04:55.778 --> 00:05:00.395
So now we can see it's
a little bit bigger.

85
00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:03.411
I'm gonna explicitly set a height
on these buttons as well.

86
00:05:03.411 --> 00:05:06.849
I'm gonna make them 100 pixels
in height like that, and

87
00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:10.238
I'm gonna set a border as well
if we go back to our designs.

88
00:05:10.238 --> 00:05:13.217
And you can see this one has a border,
we'll talk about that in a second.

89
00:05:13.217 --> 00:05:14.745
But I will set that explicitly here.

90
00:05:14.745 --> 00:05:19.426
So border, say 4 pixels solid.

91
00:05:19.426 --> 00:05:21.140
We'll call it white for now.

92
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.612
So we have two different kinds
of buttons here in our design,

93
00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:24.734
you can see we've got two.

94
00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:27.690
We've got what I would call a primary
button and a secondary button.

95
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.681
Primary button's gonna be the primary
action that you wanna draw your users to

96
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.505
secondary action, right?

97
00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:37.953
So that's how I'm going to name them.

98
00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:44.130
First I'm gonna define another
style in our base file here.

99
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:49.404
I'm gonna call this --color-button-border.

100
00:05:49.404 --> 00:05:53.441
So I could just set this to color text on
primary because we want it to be white.

101
00:05:53.441 --> 00:05:55.059
But again, we want it to be semantic.

102
00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:59.721
So what I'm actually gonna do,
since I want this to be kind of themed,

103
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.052
I'm gonna set this variable
to a variable value.

104
00:06:03.052 --> 00:06:04.898
This is common.

105
00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:09.224
You can do this, but it's when you want to
kind of keep things within the same color

106
00:06:09.224 --> 00:06:12.247
palette and still have their
own semantic meaning here.

107
00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:16.340
So, this will be our button border color,
so, instead of saying white here,

108
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.208
we can define the variable
as the button border color.

109
00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:23.348
So, that's what it's looking like.
