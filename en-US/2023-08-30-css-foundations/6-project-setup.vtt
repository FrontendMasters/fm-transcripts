1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.126
It was a lot, but all of these
things will make sense in practice.

2
00:00:03.126 --> 00:00:07.430
And the goal with that was just to give
you a really deep primer on some of these

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.488
concepts so when we're seeing them in our
project you're not completely overwhelmed.

4
00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:16.306
But feel free to stop me and
ask questions along the way.

5
00:00:16.306 --> 00:00:18.817
Let's talk about what
we're building today.

6
00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:24.064
So we're gonna build a two-page
website for a conference.

7
00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:28.158
So we'll have the homepage, it's kind of
like a big header that tells you the date,

8
00:00:28.158 --> 00:00:30.884
it's gonna have two buttons and
navigation at the top.

9
00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:34.489
And then the second page for speakers
that have a speaker image, their name,

10
00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:35.443
company, and bio.

11
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:41.039
There are some design
files that are linked.

12
00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:47.062
The easiest way to get here is to go to
the repository, which is that repo here,

13
00:00:47.062 --> 00:00:51.695
the
https//github.com/emmabostian/fem-css-fou-

14
00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:52.653
ndations.

15
00:00:52.653 --> 00:00:57.068
So if you go to this repository there
will be a link to the design files, and

16
00:00:57.068 --> 00:00:59.860
I will walk you through
those in just a second.

17
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.250
So hopefully you're able to get
onto this repo that I've made here.

18
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.483
All of the information that
you're gonna need, whether it's

19
00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:11.390
links to the slides here, or the course
information on the website is here.

20
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.079
We'll take a look at
the design in just a second.

21
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.065
The instructions for forking and
cloning are also in here,

22
00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:20.620
we'll do that together live.

23
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.430
But just as a note, there are six
branches that you'll see here.

24
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.880
So if you ever get lost,

25
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.950
after the end of each chapter you can
check out the next chapter's named branch.

26
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.470
And you'll have the code at
the starting point of that chapter.

27
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.529
I've also included a couple of
editor settings if you're using

28
00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:42.370
Visual Studio Code.

29
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.410
These are the ones that I have,
it's my theme, my font, etc.

30
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.580
So feel free to go ahead and
check that out as well.

31
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.590
Let's first talk about
what we're building today.

32
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.242
So there is a link to the Figma file here,

33
00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:57.987
right here you can view
the design files for our project.

34
00:01:57.987 --> 00:02:00.072
So again, this is a two-page website.

35
00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:05.132
Where we've got a landing page has
a heading, a subheading with the date,

36
00:02:05.132 --> 00:02:08.602
we've got two buttons,
we've got a navigation.

37
00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:15.880
Page two is a speaker's page with a photo
for each speaker, name, company, and bio.

38
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.734
There's also a mobile responsive version
for these two pages, you'll see.

39
00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:26.754
You can see also the navigation is now
gonna be a full page navigation on mobile,

40
00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:29.278
we'll get to that towards
the end of this course.

41
00:02:29.278 --> 00:02:33.079
And I've also included a design palette,
so

42
00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.980
it has our two colors,
the font families, and

43
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.296
the type scale pixel values for
each of the two view port sizes.

44
00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:46.388
I've also included a little bit of red
line design, or yellow line design

45
00:02:46.388 --> 00:02:50.750
on some of these so you can see, they
might not match exactly the final design.

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.282
Of course if you're working with a design
team I'd recommend actually making sure

47
00:02:55.282 --> 00:02:58.920
it's pixel perfect, but
these are just to kind of guide us today.

48
00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.760
So feel free to refer
back to that as needed.

49
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.650
But let's go ahead and
actually fork and clone this.

50
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.470
So forking is gonna allow us to create
a copy of this under our own user.

51
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.076
So we're gonna go ahead and
click that button,

52
00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:15.630
if you haven't already create a new fork.

53
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.747
I'm gonna fork off of my podcast
repository, don't tell my other co-hosts.

54
00:03:20.747 --> 00:03:24.550
One note about this,
uncheck copy the main branch only.

55
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.439
This will give you access to
those five other branches that

56
00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.460
I had mentioned with the code for
each chapter.

57
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.220
So then you can go ahead and
click Create Fork.

58
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.870
Once that is done, we can go ahead and
clone this to our local machine, right?

59
00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.820
So there's this code dropdown here,
you can grab the HTTPS URL here.

60
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.620
If you feel lost, if you don't have
experience with Git, that is okay.

61
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.383
The README on the repository has
screenshots and examples, or

62
00:03:52.383 --> 00:03:54.659
explanations on how you can proceed.

63
00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.300
So I'm gonna copy this and
use the CLI, the terminal,

64
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.365
to clone, but
you can also use the GitHub desktop app.

65
00:04:04.365 --> 00:04:07.801
So I'm gonna open my terminal on my Mac.

66
00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:11.540
I'm gonna change directories to
my desktop just for ease of use.

67
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.120
Did I spell that right, yes.

68
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.345
And then I'm gonna write git clone,
and paste in that URL.

69
00:04:18.561 --> 00:04:22.489
So now that that is done I should be
able to see it here on the desktop, and

70
00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:25.580
I'm gonna drag that into my
Visual Studio Code editor.

71
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.481
So here we are, I'm gonna collapse
the source control panel, and

72
00:04:30.481 --> 00:04:31.800
now we've got our folder here.

73
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.412
So let me put this in full screen mode,
let's take a quick look at what's in here.

74
00:04:37.412 --> 00:04:41.537
So we've got the README of course,
with all the links.

75
00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:44.160
And we've got our two HTML pages.

76
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.810
So we've got our index file,
which is our home page.

77
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.476
We've got our speakers file for
our speakers page.

78
00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:52.004
And I should have all of the information
here that we're gonna need.

79
00:04:53.788 --> 00:04:57.260
We've also got an icons folder with
some SVG code we'll use later.

80
00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.064
And these are just the images for
the README file,

81
00:05:01.064 --> 00:05:03.070
so we don't need to worry about those.

82
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.238
Everything else we're gonna be
creating together in real time, so

83
00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:08.520
don't worry about missing certain things.

84
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.350
So there were a couple of things.

85
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.578
So back in the README,

86
00:05:13.578 --> 00:05:17.470
there are a couple of plugins that
you're gonna wanna have installed.

87
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.230
So here if you're using Visual Studio
Code, there's an extension marketplace.

88
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.297
Live server is gonna be one that we're
going to use, so you can search for

89
00:05:26.297 --> 00:05:27.450
it here.

90
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.872
This is gonna allow us to essentially hot
reload our HTML page when we save a file,

91
00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:37.740
so it's gonna be much easier than
manually refreshing every single time

92
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.877
we save our CSS.

93
00:05:38.877 --> 00:05:43.708
The other thing that you're gonna
wanna have installed is Prettier.

94
00:05:43.708 --> 00:05:48.740
So it looks like this, Prettier,
it's a code formatter.

95
00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.526
So we don't have to worry about making
sure we tab the correct amount to make

96
00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:56.330
sure our code looks all pretty and
nice, you just can install this plugin.

97
00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.502
And to get it to work properly I had
to edit my settings in that JSON file,

98
00:06:02.502 --> 00:06:06.490
so to do that,
I have given you a code block here.

99
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.334
So it's gonna format on save, it's gonna
format our code whenever we save a file.

100
00:06:10.334 --> 00:06:12.710
It's gonna format on a copy and paste.

101
00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.532
And it's gonna set the default
formatter to HTML,

102
00:06:18.532 --> 00:06:20.846
this is what I needed to get
it to work in our HTML file.

103
00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:26.731
So I'm gonna copy this, I'm gonna open my
settings JSON file, on Mac that is CMD+P.

104
00:06:26.731 --> 00:06:31.351
I type in this greater than symbol and
it's gonna be open defaults, or,

105
00:06:31.351 --> 00:06:34.246
I'm sorry, open workplace settings JSON.

106
00:06:34.246 --> 00:06:37.723
And I'm just gonna paste in
the code from the README here.

107
00:06:37.723 --> 00:06:42.779
And so now to make sure that that is
working, let's say I go to my index file,

108
00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.111
let's say I tab In this really indented,
right?

109
00:06:46.111 --> 00:06:48.799
When I save, now you can see it
jumps back to its proper place,

110
00:06:48.799 --> 00:06:50.727
so that's what Prettier is gonna do for
us.
