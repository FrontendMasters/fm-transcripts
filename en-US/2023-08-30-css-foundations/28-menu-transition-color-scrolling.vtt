00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.920
Now, this is again, a little jarring.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.090
It is like, we are here.

3
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.940
We are not here, right?

4
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.050
We can make this a little bit nicer.

5
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.496
The first thing that we can do is add
a cursor of pointer on our menu and

6
00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:12.999
close that people know that they are,

7
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:20.560
Interactable, so pointer,
cursor pointer, right?

8
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.220
So now we are getting
that little hand icon.

9
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.070
That is nice.

10
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.280
But again, I would use a button
element if I was redoing this.

11
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.126
And lastly, let's go ahead and
just add a little now transition onto

12
00:00:30.126 --> 00:00:34.590
our navigation so that it slides in as
opposed to just appearing all of a sudden.

13
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.868
So in our now item here,
inside our main query,

14
00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:43.516
let's add a transition, oops, transition.

15
00:00:43.516 --> 00:00:48.476
We want to transition our left property
because that's the property that

16
00:00:48.476 --> 00:00:49.760
we're changing.

17
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.900
So we'll transition left.

18
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.005
I will not make this
mistake again 0.2 seconds.

19
00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:57.670
And let's just say linear is
our function here, right?

20
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.390
Let's see.

21
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.290
Now it slides in and out.

22
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.636
It's not too difficult to add
these little transitions,

23
00:01:06.636 --> 00:01:10.710
as long as you know how to
use that transition property.

24
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.226
Okay, so like I mentioned,
it's much more performance

25
00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:18.780
to animate the position from left to
right than it is to animate the width.

26
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.310
So just keep that in mind if
you do transition elements.

27
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.423
Okay, we need to add all this code to our
speakers file because if we go to our

28
00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:30.800
speakers page, it doesn't work, right?

29
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.010
So let's just go ahead and
copy and paste that over.

30
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.422
What I'm going to do, let's grab this

31
00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:44.343
the svg code here, collapse that,

32
00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:48.946
want that above the CSS Day link.

33
00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.030
CSS Day, we'll plop that right in here.

34
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.881
Okay, so now it's applied.

35
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:01.607
But you'll notice that when we click
the menu icon nothing is going on.

36
00:02:01.607 --> 00:02:02.482
Any idea why?

37
00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:07.130
&gt;&gt; The script is not applied to this page.

38
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.930
&gt;&gt; Sorry?

39
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.959
&gt;&gt; The script is not applied-
&gt;&gt; Aha, yes,

40
00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.555
the script is not applied to this page.

41
00:02:12.555 --> 00:02:17.153
We wrote it in our index HTML file.

42
00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:22.330
So since I don't wanna repeat code here,
let's go ahead and make a script file.

43
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.370
I'm gonna copy everything inside of here,
cut it out.

44
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.740
I'll just get rid of this for a second.

45
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.830
And then create an index file.

46
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.911
I'll just create it in the root.

47
00:02:35.217 --> 00:02:37.480
Index.js let's plop it in there.

48
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.690
All right, and then all we need to do
it's import it to both of our files.

49
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.722
So at the bottom of our HTML files,
right above that closing body tag,

50
00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:49.510
let's just add a script, right?

51
00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.800
Like we did before.

52
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.980
The source is gonna be in the same folder.

53
00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.170
But it's gonna be index.js just like that,
can do that on both pages, like that.

54
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.550
Okay, so now it's working.

55
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.970
I mean, it looks a little silly cuz we
got to fix our colors, but it's working.

56
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.740
Okay so the last part here is to just
fixed the colors on the speakers page.

57
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:21.090
So in the speakers page,
let's go ahead in our CSS.

58
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.356
What we wanna do at our
breakpoint of 840 pixels that

59
00:03:26.356 --> 00:03:33.695
we've defined previously width,
and we'll do max-width 840 or nav.

60
00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:37.549
We want it to have a background
color of text on primary,

61
00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.760
which is white in this case.

62
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.178
Background color var
color-text-on-primary.

63
00:03:45.178 --> 00:03:46.170
Color-text-on-primary.
Let's make sure I get this right.

64
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.210
Color-text-on-primary.

65
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.350
Okay, did that actually work?

66
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.102
It did, cool.

67
00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:55.164
You'll notice we can still scroll,

68
00:03:55.164 --> 00:03:58.830
when our menu is open which is
maybe not the best user experience.

69
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.910
So let's go ahead and fix that.

70
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.456
To prevent this,

71
00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:07.023
I'm gonna set overflow hidden on the body
element when our menu is active, right?

72
00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:09.778
So first of all write the CSS for this.

73
00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:12.500
Let's call this new class body--no-scroll.

74
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.280
We don't want you to scroll.

75
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.164
We'll just set overflow to hidden, saying
any content that's overflowing, what you

76
00:04:18.164 --> 00:04:22.595
can currently see, we're just gonna
hide it on both the x and y-axis, right?

77
00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.812
We don't have any overflow
on the x-axis right now, but

78
00:04:25.812 --> 00:04:28.570
I'm just going to use
that overflow shorthand.

79
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.965
And now, what we need to do is actually
apply this new class to our body element

80
00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:38.949
in our JavaScript as we're like hiding and
showing the menu, right?

81
00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.680
So we need to add one more variable here.

82
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.043
We'll call it body.

83
00:04:43.043 --> 00:04:47.606
And I'm just gonna use the Type Selector
to grab the body element

84
00:04:47.606 --> 00:04:51.918
doesn't need that class name,
although, if we look here,

85
00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:56.670
does have a class of body so
maybe I'll just leave it.

86
00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.060
And then, the last thing we need
to do here is body.classList.

87
00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.543
We need to add that body--no-scroll.

88
00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:06.640
Body no-scroll.

89
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.220
And then, reverse that, remove.

90
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.970
I put this in the speaker CSS file.

91
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:15.060
Important, scope is important.

92
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.140
So back to the 840 pixel break point here.

93
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.121
Here we go.

94
00:05:23.121 --> 00:05:24.190
I'll just put it at the top.

95
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.829
Okay, now it's accessible
to both of our files.

96
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.271
Cool, no more overflow scrolling issues.

97
00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:39.230
Building responsive sites.

98
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.617
Very cognitively heavy.

99
00:05:41.617 --> 00:05:42.780
But that's it.

100
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.690
If we go and look through our design file,
it looks pretty close at this point.

101
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.673
I would do a design critique with our
designer where they would go through and

102
00:05:49.673 --> 00:05:50.740
tell me what to fix.

103
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.595
We don't have designers here today,
so I say it's good enough.
