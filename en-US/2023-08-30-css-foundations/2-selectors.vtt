00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.662
So CSS is a rule-based language.

2
00:00:02.662 --> 00:00:06.348
We define these rules by creating
different styles that should be

3
00:00:06.348 --> 00:00:09.307
applied to a certain element or
a group of elements.

4
00:00:09.307 --> 00:00:13.850
So for example, if we want to select
all heading level ones on our page,

5
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.370
we can do that with the following code.

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:21.763
So we select all h1 headers
with the h1 element selector.

7
00:00:21.763 --> 00:00:25.222
So the selector is followed by
a set of curly brackets, and

8
00:00:25.222 --> 00:00:29.261
inside these curly brackets,
we're gonna write our style rules.

9
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.563
So we call these declarations.

10
00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:35.756
So a declaration is a pair that contains
a property, in this case, color, and

11
00:00:35.756 --> 00:00:37.356
a value, in this case, red.

12
00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:40.316
If we break down this into
the terminology, right,

13
00:00:40.316 --> 00:00:42.806
we've got the selector, which is h1, and

14
00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:45.782
the declaration block again
is the curly brackets.

15
00:00:48.197 --> 00:00:51.598
The declaration is the color red,
that key-value property pair.

16
00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:55.868
And again, color is a type of property and

17
00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:59.528
red is the value for that property.

18
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:01.928
So what we just saw is
known as a type selector.

19
00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:04.813
It's gonna select all
elements of type heading 1.

20
00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:09.400
Class selectors allow us to assign styles
to elements that contain a specific class

21
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.521
or a set of classes.

22
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:14.613
So this class selector is noted with
a dot followed by the class name, and

23
00:01:14.613 --> 00:01:18.317
it's used to style multiple
elements that have that class name.

24
00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:21.913
So here we're styling all elements
that have a class of title and

25
00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:23.922
we're changing that color to red.

26
00:01:23.922 --> 00:01:25.591
In this case, it's just the heading one.

27
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:28.766
We also have ID selectors.

28
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:33.430
So ID selectors allow you to assign styles
to one element containing a specific ID.

29
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.840
So it's noted with a hash symbol and
it's followed by the ID name.

30
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.049
And again, use the style one
element with that ID name.

31
00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.965
So instead of the class of
title on our heading level one,

32
00:01:44.965 --> 00:01:49.382
we've got an ID of title
setting that color to red.

33
00:01:49.382 --> 00:01:52.228
There is also a universal selector, and

34
00:01:52.228 --> 00:01:56.343
this is noted with an asterisk and
it matches any element.

35
00:01:56.343 --> 00:02:01.994
So to make every single element red,
we could write asterisk and

36
00:02:01.994 --> 00:02:05.354
then in the curly brackets color red.

37
00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:09.226
So we can also combine selectors to be
more specific about which element or

38
00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:10.732
elements we want to select.

39
00:02:10.732 --> 00:02:13.733
So what elements are gonna
be selected here?

40
00:02:13.733 --> 00:02:17.612
Does anyone wanna put that
into an English sentence?

41
00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:21.438
&gt;&gt; Paragraph within the body,
all the paragraphs.

42
00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:24.216
&gt;&gt; All the paragraphs
within a body element.

43
00:02:24.216 --> 00:02:26.823
Yeah, that's pretty true.

44
00:02:26.823 --> 00:02:30.919
The caveat is all paragraphs within
an element containing the body class.

45
00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.136
So it might not be the body element
if you put that class on a div for

46
00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:35.096
example, right?

47
00:02:35.096 --> 00:02:38.349
But yeah,
it is gonna change that color to blue.

48
00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.435
How about this one?

49
00:02:42.435 --> 00:02:47.818
&gt;&gt; It would color all
the paragraph elements

50
00:02:47.818 --> 00:02:55.055
with an ID blue inside of a tag
with a class element body.

51
00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:57.705
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right.

52
00:02:57.705 --> 00:02:59.595
So the paragraph with an ID of blue,

53
00:02:59.595 --> 00:03:03.565
that's living inside of an element
containing a class of body, exactly.
