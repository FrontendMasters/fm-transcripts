00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.830
I am really excited to be here with you
all today to teach CSS Foundations.

2
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.257
This is a course that's been in
the works for a few years now, so

3
00:00:07.257 --> 00:00:11.440
I'm really grateful to be here with
you all in person and online as well.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.360
My name is Emma,
I am an engineering manager at Spotify.

5
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.130
I am originally from upstate New York,
but I live in Stockholm, Sweden.

6
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.580
And I've lived there for
quite a few years now.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.860
And I had a baby two months ago.

8
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.860
Her name is Freya and she's the best
side project I've ever worked on.

9
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.605
In my spare time,
I love teaching it for the Masters and

10
00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:35.380
online I just love sharing knowledge so
yeah I'm thrilled to be here with you.

11
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.810
Today we're talking about CSS.

12
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.174
So this course is structured into seven
chapters we're currently in chapter one

13
00:00:43.174 --> 00:00:48.070
which is the introduction, so we'll learn
a little bit about foundational CSS.

14
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.410
And then we're gonna take a look at
a website that we're gonna build.

15
00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.462
It's a two-page website, I've put together
design files in Figma that we'll use, and

16
00:00:54.462 --> 00:00:57.780
we'll build it from start to finish,
the way that I would in production.

17
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.336
But before each chapter,

18
00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:03.670
we will talk through some of
these concepts in our slides.

19
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.959
So you're getting kind of the theory and
then also in practice.

20
00:01:10.032 --> 00:01:13.669
If you wanna actually follow along
on the slides, if you need something

21
00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:17.254
a little bit more accessible feel
free to head over to the repository.

22
00:01:17.254 --> 00:01:21.647
We will be using this later and
the next chapter we'll take a look at

23
00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:25.333
how to fork and clone this and
bring it into your IDE, but

24
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.272
feel free to go grab the course
slides from there right now.

25
00:01:29.272 --> 00:01:30.493
So it's

26
00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:39.046
