>> I am really excited to be here with you all today to teach CSS Foundations. This is a course that's been in the works for a few years now, so I'm really grateful to be here with you all in person and online as well. My name is Emma, I am an engineering manager at Spotify.

[00:00:15]
I am originally from upstate New York, but I live in Stockholm, Sweden. And I've lived there for quite a few years now. And I had a baby two months ago. Her name is Freya and she's the best side project I've ever worked on. In my spare time, I love teaching it for the Masters and online I just love sharing knowledge so yeah I'm thrilled to be here with you.

Today we're talking about CSS. So this course is structured into seven chapters we're currently in chapter one which is the introduction, so we'll learn a little bit about foundational CSS. And then we're gonna take a look at a website that we're gonna build. It's a two-page website, I've put together design files in Figma that we'll use, and we'll build it from start to finish, the way that I would in production.

But before each chapter, we will talk through some of these concepts in our slides. So you're getting kind of the theory and then also in practice. If you wanna actually follow along on the slides, if you need something a little bit more accessible feel free to head over to the repository.

We will be using this later and the next chapter we'll take a look at how to fork and clone this and bring it into your IDE, but feel free to go grab the course slides from there right now. So it's github.com/emmabostian/fem-css-foundations.
