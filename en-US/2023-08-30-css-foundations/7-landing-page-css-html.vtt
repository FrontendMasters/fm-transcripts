WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.420
Let's start on the homepage, this
orange page here, our desktop version.

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.770
We're gonna start with desktop.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.780
And we'll move into
mobile towards the end.

4
00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.022
The first big thing that I see when I'm
looking at this is we've got an orange

5
00:00:12.022 --> 00:00:12.640
background.

6
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.330
So let's do it.

7
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.840
Let's set an orange background.

8
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.235
So the first thing that I'm gonna do,
so style on our body element here,

9
00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:28.460
we're gonna say background-color,
and you can copy that hex code.

10
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.836
Of course,
you can grab it from the design file, and

11
00:00:32.836 --> 00:00:35.732
you're gonna put it in like that.

12
00:00:35.732 --> 00:00:38.649
I'm also gonna set
the text color to white.

13
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.646
Why are you mad at me?

14
00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:42.730
I have two hash symbols.

15
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.540
And we'll set color to #ffffff,
which is white.

16
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.160
And then that read me I also
linked to the plugin for this.

17
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.743
If you're wondering why it's showing up
as a physical color, that is because I

18
00:01:02.743 --> 00:01:07.360
have installed, where did my plug-in go,
this one, color highlight.

19
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.329
So feel free to install that and then
you can actually see the physical color

20
00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.350
associated with that
hex value right there.

21
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.469
Okay, so I've set a background color and
a color on our body.

22
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.632
Let's open this, so I'm gonna
right-click on our index.html file, and

23
00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:24.370
I'm gonna say open with live server.

24
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.560
And it's going to open our webpage here.

25
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.980
This looks pretty beautiful already.

26
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.350
Remember, I said that CSS adds beauty and
a nicer user experience.

27
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.750
Well, this is the prime example of that.

28
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.450
We've got our orange background, and
we've got our white text for most of it.

29
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.634
Again, this concept is
known as inline styling,

30
00:01:48.634 --> 00:01:51.240
remember we're setting the style
inline on this element.

31
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.280
But there's a second way to add CSS and
this is known as embedded CSS.

32
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.100
So to do this,
we can add a style tag in the head.

33
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.720
So I'll add a style tag.

34
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.595
If you see me typing something,

35
00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:10.820
and it just like magically appears
that there is now an element.

36
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.580
This is something called Emmet.

37
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.753
So as I type, like if I type a P for
a paragraph, you can see this pop-up,

38
00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:18.570
Emmet Abbreviation.

39
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.990
That's the tool.

40
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.854
I believe it already comes with
Visual Studio Code, but if not,

41
00:02:22.854 --> 00:02:25.120
you can search for it in the marketplace.

42
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.090
Emett Abreviation, I'm gonna try to type
all the tags out so you can follow along.

43
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.256
But in case I forget,
that's what's going on there.

44
00:02:31.256 --> 00:02:34.500
So style, got our style.

45
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.853
Embedded CSS, right.

46
00:02:35.853 --> 00:02:39.145
So now, instead of declaring it in line,
I can say select the body element,

47
00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:41.130
instead of background color.

48
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.780
To this, which auto completes for
me that orange.

49
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.379
And we wanna set the color to white and

50
00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.690
I can remove this inline style now, right?

51
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.750
And when I go back we can see it
looks the same as it did previously.

52
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.379
So this is the second way that
we can add CSS to our HTML.

53
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.753
So it works, but again it's gonna quickly
become unmanageable if we're making

54
00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:10.230
a production level application.

55
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.290
We write everything in
each individual HTML file.

56
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.530
So the solution to that
is external style sheets.

57
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.630
This is the most widely
recognized way to write CSS.

58
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.752
So the first thing we're gonna do in the
root of our project here is we're gonna

59
00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:24.510
create a new folder.

60
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.220
Now, we're gonna call it Styles.

61
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.940
Inside that styles folder, I'm going
to create a new file called index.css.

62
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.792
And I'm gonna copy this style
rule here that I've just defined,

63
00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:44.903
can remove those style tags now.

64
00:03:44.903 --> 00:03:47.979
I'm gonna put it into this index.css file,
and

65
00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.742
now you can see on save it formatted for
me it's beautiful.

66
00:03:51.742 --> 00:03:54.648
But now we actually need
to link to this file,

67
00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:59.150
otherwise the HTML file has no
idea that now we've got styles.

68
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.879
So to do that,
we use this element called link.

69
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.814
I am gonna use the Emmet Abbreviation for

70
00:04:04.814 --> 00:04:07.650
this because I don't wanna
forget the attributes here.

71
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.547
The link element takes a rel attribute,
which is hey,

72
00:04:11.547 --> 00:04:15.120
this is a style sheet and
a link to the style sheet.

73
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.944
So we're gonna say this is in our current
folder we wanna go into the styles folder.

74
00:04:21.944 --> 00:04:24.950
And it point to the index's CSS file.

75
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.830
So now we have our external
CSS stylesheet, and

76
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.640
we've linked to it in the head.

77
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.290
And again,
everything is working as expected.

78
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.620
If we go back here, we can see we don't
want our links to be blue and purple.

79
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.370
We want them to be white,
so let's change that.

80
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.060
Let's go back to our CSS file here,

81
00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:53.820
I'm gonna declare a link selector or
type selector for the links, right.

82
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.770
So the color, well, we've already declared
the color on the body element is white.

83
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.520
So I'm just gonna inherit,
this is how inherit works.

84
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.520
It's saying, hey, find my parents that
has a declaration for the color value.

85
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.408
Let's inherit.

86
00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:09.580
When we save,
you can see now our links are white.

87
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.540
We also don't want them to be underlined.

88
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.730
This is a default styling of links.

89
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.010
So we can go ahead and remove that.

90
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.560
We'll say text decoration.

91
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.409
We can also set this to inherit.

92
00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.059
And now,
our links are no longer underlined.

93
00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:29.550
It goes also be text decoration none.

94
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.500
That's another value you can use here.

95
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.550
So text decoration none.

96
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.160
Either works.

97
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.009
Just it's nice to see how
inherit works sometimes.

98
00:05:40.363 --> 00:05:43.680
Okay, so Times New Roman is not
the sexiest of fonts is it?

99
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.930
So if we go back to our style guide here,
we've got two font families.

100
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.910
So we have Inter Bold and Inter Regular.

101
00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.200
So we gonna use Google Fonts for these.

102
00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.840
So if you wanna head
over to fonts.google.com.

103
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.830
So these are all free
fonts that you can use.

104
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.449
I use them quite often,
especially for personal projects.

105
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.333
And like I had mentioned,
we're using Inter as our font family and

106
00:06:08.333 --> 00:06:10.270
then the weights are gonna be bold and
regular.

107
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.610
So we can go ahead and search for
those on Google Fonts.

108
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.860
It's gonna be this first one here.

109
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:17.610
So I'm gonna open it.

110
00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.490
So we wanted regular and we wanted bold.

111
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.280
You can see here I've
got both of them added.

112
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.310
As you scroll down, you can see
the different weights that you can select.

113
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.188
So like I could download every
single font weight for this, but

114
00:06:31.188 --> 00:06:32.660
it's gonna bloat my file.

115
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.900
I don't need them all,
we just need regular and bold.

116
00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.620
So you can select them here, and
they'll show up on the right panel.

117
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.500
So, there are two ways that
we can get custom fonts in.

118
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.130
Let's start with the first one
which is to download them.

119
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.299
So I'm gonna click this Download All
button and I'm gonna unzip it.

120
00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:59.550
And when we go in, you can see we've got
this static file with our font TTF files.

121
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.972
So I want to take a bold and
regular font weights and

122
00:07:05.972 --> 00:07:09.690
move them into a new folder called fonts.

123
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.176
So first let's go and create that
folder so we can save our font files,

124
00:07:13.176 --> 00:07:14.250
New Folder, Fonts.

125
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.020
And now I wanna drag
them into this project.

126
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.150
So I'm gonna get out of
full screen mode here.

127
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.762
So we've got Inter Bold and Inter Regular,
and I'm just gonna drag them in like this.

128
00:07:30.051 --> 00:07:31.960
Cool, so, they're both here now.

129
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.167
Obviously, I don't render anything
in Visual Studio Code, but

130
00:07:34.167 --> 00:07:35.340
now we've got our two files here.

131
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.320
Let's go back into full screen mode.

132
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.525
So, in order to use these 2TTF files,

133
00:07:43.525 --> 00:07:46.609
we need to create two font-based
rules in our index file.

134
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.342
So above this body selector,
we're gonna use the font base, here.

135
00:07:52.342 --> 00:07:57.720
So font base and inside the curly brackets
we wanted to find that font family.

136
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.220
In our case, it's Inter.

137
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:03.571
Now because again,
this is not space separated name,

138
00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:06.150
we don't need the quotations around it.

139
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.550
You are welcome to add them as well.

140
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.791
So our font family is Inter,
and the source,

141
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:16.140
the source file, is gonna be a URL,
so it's in our fonts folder.

142
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:19.362
We need to go up a level, remember,
cuz we're in our styles folder, so

143
00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:22.390
we go up one level to the root and
we need to go into our fonts folder.

144
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:29.584
And the file we want for the regular
weight is the Inter-Regular.ttf.

145
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.240
I am gonna do the same thing for
bold, so feel free to do that.

146
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.936
I'm just gonna change these to the bold
values, inter-bold and inter-bold,

147
00:08:38.936 --> 00:08:39.635
like that.

148
00:08:42.562 --> 00:08:44.950
So those are our two
font based declarations.

149
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.890
Let's update our font family here and
see if it actually worked.

150
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:55.328
So if we change the font family in our

151
00:08:55.328 --> 00:09:00.248
body element font-famil,y Interbold,

152
00:09:00.248 --> 00:09:05.041
let's see see if intervals works for us.

153
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:06.306
We can see it's loaded.

154
00:09:06.306 --> 00:09:12.380
So that's how you're going to
use downloaded font files.

155
00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.323
If you're working on an enterprise
app with proprietary fonts,

156
00:09:15.323 --> 00:09:17.791
this is probably the way to
go unless they're on a CDN.

157
00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:25.243
But we can also use the Google CDN,
so we don't have to download and

158
00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:27.720
have these files in our project, right?

159
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.400
They provide links here.

160
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.580
So let's copy these two link elements or
I guess why is it say three?

161
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.892
Yeah, okay, there are three,
copy these link elements, Put them in our,

162
00:09:42.579 --> 00:09:45.585
Project above our stylesheet here.

163
00:09:48.264 --> 00:09:53.144
So, when we go back here we can see
it shows you how to actually declare

164
00:09:53.144 --> 00:09:57.490
this as a font family now,
font family inter comma sensor.

165
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.470
Remember this is the fallback,
global font or generic one.

166
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.739
So to see if that's working, we can get
rid of these font face declarations now.

167
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.243
And change this to Inter.

168
00:10:09.243 --> 00:10:12.759
We'll do san-serif.

169
00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.873
It did in Google.

170
00:10:18.164 --> 00:10:18.995
And it's working.

171
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.910
So notice that we don't have to have two
font families defined like we did with

172
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.630
the font base rule.

173
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:32.810
We can just change the font weight
value to bold and it will work.

174
00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.506
So, instead of saying like inter-bold
we can say it font weight,

175
00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:38.790
it's not bold and now it's bold.

176
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.020
So that is one difference.

177
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.484
So, you can actually go ahead and
remove these files, we don't need them but

178
00:10:45.484 --> 00:10:48.663
I'm gonna leave them there just so
you can see how to play with them.

179
00:10:53.249 --> 00:11:00.210
If we go over to our speakers page,
it doesn't look like the home page at all.

180
00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.914
We're missing the orange background,
we're missing the font,

181
00:11:02.914 --> 00:11:05.044
the links are still blue and
purple and underlined.

182
00:11:08.809 --> 00:11:12.130
So this is because we have to import
the stylesheet on that HTML page as

183
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.330
well, right?

184
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.803
So we could use the same index.css
file on the speakers page, but

185
00:11:16.803 --> 00:11:18.570
if we go back to our design files,

186
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.710
you can see the styles are pretty
different across these two pages.

187
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.977
Speakers is white background
with orange text, and

188
00:11:24.977 --> 00:11:26.890
home is orange background with white text.

189
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.430
So I'm gonna separate these
into two different styles.

190
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.840
Style, what's the word I'm looking for?

191
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.410
Files?

192
00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.470
Yeah, files.

193
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.647
So I'll make a new file
called speakers.css here.

194
00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:45.820
I'm just gonna import that
into the speaker's HTML page,

195
00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.570
so I don't forget and
wonder why styles are not being applied.

196
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.829
So remember,
it's the link tag rel style sheet.

197
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:57.236
And the href is going to be styles,
speaker css, like that.
