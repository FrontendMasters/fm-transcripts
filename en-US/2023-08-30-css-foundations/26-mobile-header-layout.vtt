1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.660
So this is the last part.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.657
And this is one that you'll
probably see quite often, and

3
00:00:04.657 --> 00:00:07.180
this is the mobile navigation, right?

4
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.549
So in our example here, you can see
instead of the logo on the left, the nav,

5
00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.508
and then the shopping cart icon,
what instead we have, on the left,

6
00:00:15.508 --> 00:00:18.992
we've got a hamburger menu,
the logo's in the middle, and

7
00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:21.080
the shopping cart's on the right.

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.093
And when we click that hamburger menu,
we've got a full page navigation

9
00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:32.568
that pops out, and that hamburger
menu changes to a close icon.

10
00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:38.760
[COUGH] Now we can still use the markup,
the same markup.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.273
We don't need an entirely new
mobile navigation element or

12
00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:44.460
set of elements to make this happen.

13
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.090
We can just style our
navigation differently.

14
00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:53.136
So first, let's add that menu
SVG icon to our index file.

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.110
Inside of our icons folder,
we've got menu, right?

16
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.631
I'm gonna do inline SVG again because
we're gonna need to change the color,

17
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.670
the speaker's page.

18
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.068
So we'll do inline SVG.

19
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.360
I will paste this above the CSS,
let's go to our index file, hold on.

20
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.860
Where are you?

21
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.205
This one,
paste this above the CSS alink here, so

22
00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:29.880
that's gonna be plopped right in there.

23
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.580
And I'm gonna add a class
to this SVG called menu.

24
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.825
This will be very useful when we have
to open and close that menu, okay.

25
00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.666
So if we look back in our UI,

26
00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:53.390
things look a little bit chaotic, right?

27
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.690
Let's see what's going on here.

28
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.119
Inside of our header, we now have
this SVG being rendered, right?

29
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.090
But we told our grid we
only wanted three columns.

30
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.690
So now the shopping cart icon
has moved into a new row.

31
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.240
Okay, well,
we don't really want that to happen.

32
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.282
What we want to happen is
the menu icon to display

33
00:02:14.282 --> 00:02:19.013
only when the viewport width is small
enough to need a mobile navigation.

34
00:02:19.013 --> 00:02:23.650
So we don't want this in the UI
until we hit a certain viewpoint.

35
00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.858
So, in the base file,
I'm gonna do this in base,

36
00:02:27.858 --> 00:02:32.090
on the menu icon,
I'm gonna set display: none.

37
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.087
And I mentioned previously, display:
none will remove it from the DOM, so

38
00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:39.900
it's not gonna appear until we
explicitly tell it to appear, right?

39
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.880
So we also want to ensure our icon is
appearing on our orange background,

40
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.940
because by default that icon is orange.

41
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.759
So again, just like we did with the
shopping cart, we can target the path and

42
00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.020
set the fill color on it.

43
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.657
We only want this on the homepage,
remember, so

44
00:02:56.657 --> 00:03:00.560
maybe I'll do this on
the index.css file here.

45
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.960
So .home .menu, and
we're targeting the path of that menu SVG.

46
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.140
Let's fill it, and we'll fill it with

47
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:15.616
color-text-on-primary to give that white,
all right?

48
00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:21.530
If I remove that display none for
one second here, it should render white.

49
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.540
Yeah, now we're seeing it here, right?

50
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.370
Okay, putting that display: none back on.

51
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.460
So we wanna hide our navigation items,
our nav bar here.

52
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.749
Let's hide them at 840 pixels for
now, okay?

53
00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:37.640
And we'll come back to them later.

54
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.680
We'll also show our menu
icon at 840 pixels.

55
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.856
So that'll be the width of our viewport
that we switch over to that mobile

56
00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:44.490
navigation.

57
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.820
So, 840,
let's put it right here in the middle.

58
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:58.057
So, media, max-width, 840.

59
00:03:58.057 --> 00:04:02.030
Okay, so
first let's display our menu icon, right?

60
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.000
So instead of display: none,
it'll be display: block.

61
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.280
Display is a block element.

62
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.090
And then also let's hide our nav items.

63
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.540
So display: none.

64
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.504
Just for now, right?

65
00:04:15.504 --> 00:04:17.831
So when I go to 840 pixels, look,

66
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:21.820
our nav items are now hidden and
we've got our icon showing up.

67
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.205
Okay, we also have to update
our header grid to account for

68
00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:31.600
the new menu icon, right?

69
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.980
Because before we had the logo,
then the nav, then the shopping cart icon.

70
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.700
So at 840 pixels, we need to update
the grid layout to work with that.

71
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.450
So let's go ahead and add this in here.

72
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.455
So header was our grid container,
so header.

73
00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.390
I guess I don't need
the display: grid here.

74
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.543
Because that's redundant, already has
a display of grid, but just to remind you.

75
00:04:56.543 --> 00:04:59.660
So we need to define three new columns,
right?

76
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:08.000
The width of this icon,
if we inspect it, the width is 21.

77
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.710
It's a little bit small, in my opinion.

78
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.460
Hold on, if I go into my design file.

79
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.020
Yeah, 21.

80
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.730
Well, let's try it with 21 and
see what happens.

81
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.360
I actually had 33 pixels written down.

82
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.520
If I try 33, let's try it and
see if it looks any different.

83
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.840
And I can change it to fit
the exact width if needed.

84
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.810
So one fraction for that, the logo.

85
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.125
And then remember our shopping
cart icon was 34 pixels, so

86
00:05:36.125 --> 00:05:38.140
we can keep that as defined, right?

87
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.382
So when I change that, now we can
see we've got those three columns,

88
00:05:44.382 --> 00:05:46.860
three grid areas, right?

89
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.096
So one for the mobile nav icon,
one for the logo, and

90
00:05:51.096 --> 00:05:54.090
then one for the shopping cart.

91
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.480
We also wanna align our items so
they sit in the center.

92
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.251
align-items: center, right?

93
00:05:59.251 --> 00:06:04.090
So now, Why you don't like that?

94
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:07.430
Let's find out.

95
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.885
align-items: center,
is it justify content?

96
00:06:11.885 --> 00:06:18.005
justify-items, [LAUGH] syntax.

97
00:06:21.875 --> 00:06:23.282
Where'd you go?

98
00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.361
There we go.

99
00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.840
Look at that, justify-items.

100
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.345
Today we're learning
that syntax is important.
