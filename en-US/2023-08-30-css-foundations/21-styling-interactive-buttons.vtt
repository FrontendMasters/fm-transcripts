1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.118
To style the primary and
secondary buttons, I'm going to give

2
00:00:03.118 --> 00:00:06.983
them a modifier, right, we talked about
modifiers with block element modifier.

3
00:00:06.983 --> 00:00:10.909
Let's go ahead and
actually use them in practice, so button,

4
00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.290
we want this to be button primary,
and this will be button secondary.

5
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.858
So this will allow us to have some
similar styling with the button class and

6
00:00:21.858 --> 00:00:24.740
then customize it based
on the modifier here.

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.923
I'm also going to create a couple more
variables in our base file that will allow

8
00:00:30.923 --> 00:00:31.930
us to be consistent.

9
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.240
So I'm going to declare color,

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.391
we'll call it button,
primary background, and

11
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:47.670
we'll give this the color text on primary,
we'll set it to that.

12
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.852
And this is relating again, back to here
we can see we have a white background with

13
00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.262
orange text, so that's our first variable.

14
00:00:54.262 --> 00:00:58.869
The second one is going to be color,
it's going to be for the button,

15
00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:04.440
it's going to be the primary text, and
this is going to be a Color primary.

16
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.759
It's a little bit verbose here,
but just bear with me.

17
00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.751
Now we can actually use these, so
if I go back to our button code for

18
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:14.520
our primary one, let's use those primary.

19
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.632
So I wanna set background color to
our primary background variable

20
00:01:21.632 --> 00:01:22.940
we just defined.

21
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.454
Button primary background, same for
color, bar, color, button, primary, text.

22
00:01:35.717 --> 00:01:40.371
So there is something going wrong here,
let's figure out what's going wrong,

23
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.090
maybe I set the wrong values.

24
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.414
Our button primary, I set to orange,
I set it to our primary value,

25
00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:50.989
not our primary text value,
we want to swap those, right.

26
00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.888
Real-time debugging, let's go fix that, so

27
00:01:54.888 --> 00:02:01.521
we want this one to be color primary,
not color text on primary, color primary.

28
00:02:04.377 --> 00:02:08.916
I'm sorry this is supposed to be white,
I get myself all

29
00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:13.858
confused white background orange
text color text on white.

30
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:27.303
Okay, now we're really going into bug
together, what am I doing wrong here?

31
00:02:27.303 --> 00:02:29.340
You know what, look at this,

32
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.651
I have to find bar twice this is what's
going wrong I believe let's find out.

33
00:02:37.584 --> 00:02:40.956
Me and my typos, let's see is this,
this is a moment of truth here.

34
00:02:45.078 --> 00:02:49.573
Look at that, silly, we'll do the same
thing with the secondary button right

35
00:02:49.573 --> 00:02:53.062
we're going to set the background
color and the font color.

36
00:02:53.062 --> 00:02:57.522
In this case we have a border,
we either have an orange background or

37
00:02:57.522 --> 00:03:02.558
no background depending on how you're
looking at this and then white text.

38
00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:07.299
So just to make sure I don't have typos,
we're gonna do the same thing,

39
00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.580
copy and pasting, except I'm changing
the primary to secondary here.

40
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.288
Secondary now the question is,
can I type that without misspelling it?

41
00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:23.090
So we've got secondary for both of these
our background color, instead of white,

42
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:29.132
we want it to be the primary color, so
we want it to be that orange, right.

43
00:03:29.132 --> 00:03:34.117
So color, primary, like that and
we want our text to be color,

44
00:03:34.117 --> 00:03:36.480
text on primary, like that.

45
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.771
I'm gonna copy and paste this for
the secondary button,

46
00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:45.782
as well make sure I'm not miss
typing anything secondary.

47
00:03:45.782 --> 00:03:49.908
And instead of color button primary
background it'd be secondary,

48
00:03:49.908 --> 00:03:51.122
also be secondary.

49
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:58.036
No typos there that's what copy and
pasting does,

50
00:03:58.036 --> 00:04:01.279
okay, colors are working that looks nice.

51
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:10.220
We do need to align the buttons they're
looking a little bit misaligned here.

52
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.884
So to do that, I'm going to create
a little wrapper around these buttons,

53
00:04:14.884 --> 00:04:17.413
since a little easier to position them.

54
00:04:17.413 --> 00:04:22.117
I'm gonna call it div and I will
give it a class of button container.

55
00:04:24.513 --> 00:04:29.576
Button-container, right,
okay, I now have a wrapping

56
00:04:29.576 --> 00:04:35.680
container that's gonna help us
align these buttons in a nice way.

57
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.580
I've already started writing
this in the base file,

58
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.210
I'm just gonna continue in here.

59
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.529
But I guess this is really
specific to the homepage, so

60
00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:47.161
you might wanna think about moving that
out if you were to do this on your own.

61
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:51.554
So in our button container we're laying
things out in one dimension right,

62
00:04:51.554 --> 00:04:53.965
we want to align things in one dimension.

63
00:04:53.965 --> 00:04:56.322
So that's a great use case for Flexbox so

64
00:04:56.322 --> 00:05:01.660
I'm going to set the display property of
flex on our container, and look at that.

65
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.750
They're lined up, right, but we want
them to have a little bit of space.

66
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.783
So this is where our pseudo-selectors
are going to come into play or

67
00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:15.110
pseudo-classes, right, so we want to give
some space between the buttons, right?

68
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.796
But I don't want this second button
is the last element in the container,

69
00:05:18.796 --> 00:05:22.126
I don't want that to have a margin
end because it doesn't need it,

70
00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:24.700
there's nothing to the right of it.

71
00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.528
So, how do we target that?

72
00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:35.041
I want all buttons to have,
margin in line end 20 pixels,

73
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:41.675
right, so regardless of text direction
It's right to left, left to right.

74
00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:46.020
Margin-inline-end is the right one here,
not margin-right.

75
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:50.129
However, like I just mentioned,
I don't want the last one to have this,

76
00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.600
because if we go in here,
does it visually make a difference?

77
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.806
Not right now because there's nothing to
the right of it, but let's say we added I

78
00:05:58.806 --> 00:06:02.770
don't know something else to the right of
it we might not want that margin there.

79
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.247
So to get rid of that we'll target all
elements with a class of button, but

80
00:06:09.247 --> 00:06:14.590
not this is where that not comes
into play, the last of type.

81
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.268
We don't want that last
button to have this margin.

82
00:06:22.782 --> 00:06:26.394
So you can see it, it's no longer there,
we've excluded that.

83
00:06:28.966 --> 00:06:33.682
Okay, last thing with these buttons,
we need to center this icon,

84
00:06:33.682 --> 00:06:38.580
in order to do that, I'll just give
it a class so it's easy to target.

85
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.789
Give it class button,
icon, we'll call you,

86
00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.303
and the last thing we want to do

87
00:06:52.631 --> 00:06:56.017
Well, we didn't learn about this property,
but there is a way to

88
00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:59.292
center things vertically, and
it's called vertical align.

89
00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:04.395
And we want that to be vertically
aligned in the middle,

90
00:07:04.395 --> 00:07:09.835
so we can see now that icon is
centered vertically, right.

91
00:07:09.835 --> 00:07:14.822
If we take it away, it's not centered,
vertical align will do that for us.

92
00:07:14.822 --> 00:07:18.080
Sometimes you'll see Flexbox
used within button elements,

93
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.341
I like to try and
avoid that, it does work.

94
00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:25.093
But if you can use vertical align,
I would recommend doing that.

95
00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:28.158
Last thing I'm going to give
the button container some top margin,

96
00:07:28.158 --> 00:07:31.247
because right now it's sitting
right up against that subheading.

97
00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:34.712
So let's fix that, let's do that here and

98
00:07:34.712 --> 00:07:39.339
the button container will
give it a margin, margin top.

99
00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:41.499
We'll give it 100 pixels.

100
00:07:44.562 --> 00:07:49.831
Now it's got some space,
there's one other thing

101
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:57.684
I want to try here on our button I'm
gonna give it a box-sizing a border box.

102
00:07:57.684 --> 00:08:00.838
Just remember we wanted it to have
a width of a hundred, or, I'm sorry,

103
00:08:00.838 --> 00:08:01.840
a height of a hundred.

104
00:08:06.499 --> 00:08:10.704
Where did you go, where's my box sizing?

105
00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:12.313
Here we go, box sizing, border box.

106
00:08:14.637 --> 00:08:19.076
And this instance is not gonna
change it because, again,

107
00:08:19.076 --> 00:08:24.978
we've set the width and height, but
we did not have a border defined on this.

108
00:08:24.978 --> 00:08:28.400
We do have a border to find on this,
box sizing border box, well,

109
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.351
it's not looking like it's
doing very much, does it?

110
00:08:35.385 --> 00:08:41.895
Width of 206,92, it does look like
it's subtracting out the top and

111
00:08:41.895 --> 00:08:46.852
bottom border here, right,
so the content box is 92,

112
00:08:46.852 --> 00:08:50.490
so if we add up that 8, it equals 100.

113
00:08:55.663 --> 00:09:02.390
Okay, one last thing, there are a couple
of things we can do to improve the site.

114
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:05.104
So our button elements don't do
anything when we're clicked, but

115
00:09:05.104 --> 00:09:07.673
it would be nice to show the hover
state and focus state on these so

116
00:09:07.673 --> 00:09:10.590
users recognize that they're buttons and
they can interact with them.

117
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.794
So the last thing I'm going to do
before we wrap up the homepage here,

118
00:09:15.794 --> 00:09:19.840
I'm just going to set the cursor
on our button to a pointer value.

119
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.822
So now users say, this is clickable,
this is a button, right,

120
00:09:24.822 --> 00:09:31.400
I'm also going to give it a hover and a
focus state button, hover, button, focus.

121
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.741
And you notice I've combined these two
selectors with a comma, saying both of

122
00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:39.847
these separate selectors, these
are the styles to apply to both of them.

123
00:09:39.847 --> 00:09:45.700
And in this case, I'm going to give it
an outline, I'll say two pixels solid.

124
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.200
We'll just say color text on primary,
so it'll be white,

125
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.488
right, in this case, so bar,
color, text on primary.

126
00:09:56.488 --> 00:10:02.289
So, got our outline on hover,
the outlines being applied,

127
00:10:02.289 --> 00:10:06.970
and see it's a little bit
like not super smooth.

128
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.571
So just to fix that we can
transition this property transition,

129
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:15.250
outline, say point two seconds and linear.

130
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:18.160
So there are a transition function,
time, and

131
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.010
the property that we
want to transition here.

132
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:26.360
&gt;&gt; They're saying you need the units and
the 0.20.

133
00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.267
&gt;&gt; Are you serious?

134
00:10:28.267 --> 00:10:30.483
&gt;&gt; Yes, so you need the seconds, yes.

135
00:10:30.483 --> 00:10:33.603
&gt;&gt; Well, look at that,
I love the chat and I love this room for

136
00:10:33.603 --> 00:10:35.870
not making me sit here in isolation.

137
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.696
But that is such a silly little bug.

138
00:10:38.696 --> 00:10:44.740
CSS, okay, so that's it for this section
of the homepage, it's looking great.

139
00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:50.032
It's done, so all that's left is to
finish up the speakers page, which it

140
00:10:50.032 --> 00:10:55.747
looks like a lot, but we've already done
quite a bit we just need to apply it now.
