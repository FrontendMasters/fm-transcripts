WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.569
Okay, so I mean,
admittedly that's not terrible.

2
00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:07.719
Look at that, it's our mobile nav,
it's not beautiful,

3
00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.948
not building the world's most beautiful
website, but it is functional,

4
00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:17.891
so, What we want

5
00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.149
now is when we click this menu icon-
&gt;&gt; I think there is a line item,

6
00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.956
a line content as well.

7
00:00:23.956 --> 00:00:27.650
&gt;&gt; Indeed, yeah, CSS tricks has
fantastic articles on grid and flexbox.

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.300
If you ever get confused,
I can absolutely recommend that.

9
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.838
Okie dokie, so we're almost there.

10
00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:42.352
What we wanna do, click on this menu icon
and have the mobile nav pop up, right?

11
00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:47.825
Also, I had mentioned that the width
was 21 pixels on this icon,

12
00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:51.262
but I had set it to 33 in the grid column.

13
00:00:51.262 --> 00:00:53.897
It should be 33 pixels, right?

14
00:00:53.897 --> 00:00:56.473
So I'm gonna actually fix this.

15
00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.754
When I go into the inline SVG,

16
00:00:59.754 --> 00:01:05.674
I want the width to be 33,
let's see what happens.

17
00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:10.714
That did not do anything, did it?

18
00:01:15.952 --> 00:01:17.968
Width 33.

19
00:01:20.526 --> 00:01:24.702
Or was it supposed to be height 33,

20
00:01:24.702 --> 00:01:29.570
let's find out, let's try that, 33.

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.723
No, it still doesn't like me.

22
00:01:34.044 --> 00:01:36.570
Okay, and my icon's the wrong size now.

23
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.282
Well, that's silly,

24
00:01:41.282 --> 00:01:46.398
what we're gonna do is we're gonna check
myself because I wanna get that right.

25
00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:48.422
Let's see here.

26
00:01:48.422 --> 00:01:51.236
Our menu has a width of 33 and
36, aha, okay,

27
00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:54.260
so I don't need to be
editing the viewBox as well.

28
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.176
Let's try that again.

29
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.296
Scrub the dimensions from the repo,

30
00:01:59.296 --> 00:02:02.362
I wanna make sure that it's right
when you're referring back to it.

31
00:02:02.362 --> 00:02:05.764
So width 33, height 36, let's try that.

32
00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:08.102
Width 33, height 36.

33
00:02:08.102 --> 00:02:09.548
See how that looks.

34
00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:15.915
Okay, that's better.

35
00:02:15.915 --> 00:02:20.909
So now that that is fixed, let's get that
menu showing up when we click the icon.

36
00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:27.597
So first,
instead of display: none on our nav,

37
00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:33.481
which we did set in base,
where did you go?

38
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:37.765
Here we go, instead of display: none,
we do want to display this navigation.

39
00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:43.185
Now, we're gonna play with the position.

40
00:02:43.185 --> 00:02:48.206
It is much more performant to
transition a fully width element

41
00:02:48.206 --> 00:02:53.625
from left to right than it is to
transition the width of something.

42
00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:58.131
So if we changed the width from 0 pixels
to, I don't know, 100 view width,

43
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:02.864
that would be much less performant because
we're repainting every time, right?

44
00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:08.680
So we want it to be that full view width,
just outside the balance of our viewport.

45
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.179
So that's how we're gonna approach this.

46
00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:15.565
To do that,
we're gonna use position: absolute, right?

47
00:03:15.565 --> 00:03:20.120
Remember that's gonna remove
it from the document flow.

48
00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.796
So I want the width of this
nav to be 100 view width,

49
00:03:23.796 --> 00:03:29.295
take up the entire viewport width,
height: 100 viewport height, right?

50
00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:41.842
I also want to move this.

51
00:03:41.842 --> 00:03:43.293
Well, first of all,
let's change the background.

52
00:03:43.293 --> 00:03:47.149
So if we look at our design again,
we can see when the menu is open,

53
00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.341
it has a solid background of orange.

54
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:52.197
So let's go ahead and
set that now, background,

55
00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:57.797
we'll set it to the --color-primary,
Right?

56
00:04:01.183 --> 00:04:03.231
It's there,
It's just not in the right place.

57
00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:04.019
So let's fix that.

58
00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.426
Let's set the top and the left value.

59
00:04:08.426 --> 00:04:13.426
So let's try 60 pixels and
let's set the left value to 0%.

60
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.306
Let's see what happens.

61
00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:19.166
Okay, that's not horrible, right?

62
00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:22.440
If we look at our design,
we still wanna have this header, right?

63
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.478
So that's why we set top to 60
pixels because we wanna account for

64
00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:27.767
the height of that header,
we still wanna see it.

65
00:04:30.805 --> 00:04:36.136
So here we've got our header,
and here is our nav, right?

66
00:04:36.136 --> 00:04:38.768
It's taken up that full
viewport height and width.

67
00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:47.242
Let's also give it a little
bit of padding, so our items,

68
00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:51.654
they're not gonna be right
up against the edges there.

69
00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:56.262
Now, we also want the menu items to
be bigger, this looks kinda silly.

70
00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:58.886
And we want them to be much bigger and

71
00:04:58.886 --> 00:05:02.825
vertically on top of each other,
so let's fix that.

72
00:05:02.825 --> 00:05:06.337
So, nav_list, first of all,
let's address the list.

73
00:05:06.337 --> 00:05:10.714
We want the flex-direction of this flex
container to be column instead of row.

74
00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:14.218
So let's change that first,
flex-direction is column, right?

75
00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.589
List items are now in a column.

76
00:05:18.754 --> 00:05:25.198
Let's also justify-content: space-around.

77
00:05:25.198 --> 00:05:27.523
This will be more apparent
when we change the font size.

78
00:05:29.618 --> 00:05:32.398
I'm also gonna set a height
on this nav__list to 80%.

79
00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:35.637
I don't want it to be the full
height of its container.

80
00:05:37.934 --> 00:05:40.083
Okay, last thing is to
set the font size and

81
00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.559
font weight of our nav items to be
much bigger, just like our design.

82
00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:47.522
So nav_list-item,
let's set font size to 60 pixels and

83
00:05:47.522 --> 00:05:50.173
see what happens, we'll make it bold.

84
00:05:52.906 --> 00:05:59.352
Okay, well, that looks pretty
close to our design, not terrible.

85
00:05:59.352 --> 00:06:02.695
So now we don't wanna show this menu
unless our button is clicked, right?

86
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:07.951
So let's actually take this nav and
let's move it off screen.

87
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:11.420
Let's move it outside the bounds of
our viewport until we're ready for it.

88
00:06:13.202 --> 00:06:18.349
So let's go back here,
we currently have left at 0%,

89
00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:25.693
let's move that to -100%, that's
gonna move it off the screen, right?

90
00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.763
I've done something silly here,
instead of padding all around,

91
00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:36.047
we just want padding top,
my mistake, right?

92
00:06:36.047 --> 00:06:39.433
Okay, now our nav is off the screen,
you can see it's still there,

93
00:06:39.433 --> 00:06:41.819
it's just outside
the bounds of our viewport.

94
00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:45.640
And then when we click that menu icon,
then we want it to become visible, right?

95
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.500
The easiest way I found to do
this is to create a class that

96
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.057
will be applied when we want it to be.

97
00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:54.220
So nav--visible, we'll call it.

98
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.162
When we want that nav to be visible,
then we'll set the left value to 0,

99
00:06:59.162 --> 00:07:01.199
so it'll be in view, right?

100
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:04.301
Okay, now we're gonna have to add
just a small amount of JavaScript.

101
00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:06.912
And it's okay if you're
unfamiliar with JavaScript,

102
00:07:06.912 --> 00:07:08.861
I'll walk you through what's going on.

103
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:13.945
So inside of our index file here,
at the bottom,

104
00:07:13.945 --> 00:07:17.547
we're gonna add a script, okay?

105
00:07:17.547 --> 00:07:18.845
This is where we're gonna
write our JavaScript.

106
00:07:18.845 --> 00:07:21.687
So, first, I wanna grab a handle
on that navigation element so

107
00:07:21.687 --> 00:07:25.270
that we can actually play with whether or
not it's visible.

108
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.355
Let's do that.

109
00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:29.869
So I'll create a new variable,
const, call it nav.

110
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:33.472
I'll use document.querySelector
to grab a handle on that node,

111
00:07:33.472 --> 00:07:35.931
which has a class of nav,
so I'm using that.

112
00:07:38.615 --> 00:07:41.777
I also need to grab a handle to that
menu icon to make sure that we can set

113
00:07:41.777 --> 00:07:45.071
an event listener and check whether or
not it's been clicked, right?

114
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:45.951
So I'll just do that now.

115
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:47.844
So we'll call it menu,

116
00:07:47.844 --> 00:07:52.778
use querySelector again and
grab it by the class name of menu.

117
00:07:52.778 --> 00:07:58.449
Now, when our menu item is clicked,
let's addEventListener for that, right?

118
00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:02.193
When we click that, what do we wanna do?

119
00:08:02.193 --> 00:08:05.778
We wanna show our menu, we just
created that nav--visible class, so

120
00:08:05.778 --> 00:08:07.281
we wanna apply that, right?

121
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:09.197
So we can do that with class list.

122
00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:12.830
So nav.classlist, we'll say,

123
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:17.915
add, nav--visible.

124
00:08:19.764 --> 00:08:23.493
Okay, when we click our menu,
let's show a nav.

125
00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:25.751
Let's see if that works.

126
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:27.317
Look at that, it does work.

127
00:08:27.317 --> 00:08:30.437
If I refresh,
you can see it again, it's there.

128
00:08:30.437 --> 00:08:31.316
All right, but

129
00:08:31.316 --> 00:08:35.519
it doesn't actually go away when we
click an X icon cuz there's no X icon.

130
00:08:35.519 --> 00:08:39.840
So let's fix that,
let's grab that close-menu-svg.

131
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.148
Again, we will do in line.

132
00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.023
This is the Menu icon,
we'll put it right underneath there.

133
00:08:59.054 --> 00:09:00.705
Okay.

134
00:09:03.587 --> 00:09:06.740
Where did you go?

135
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.435
It's this one.

136
00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:08.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

137
00:09:08.667 --> 00:09:13.200
Okay, so the class on here,
we'll call this close.

138
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.737
Again, we wanna change the width and
height so

139
00:09:15.737 --> 00:09:19.588
that it looks a little bit nicer and
is in line with our grid cell there.

140
00:09:19.588 --> 00:09:23.248
So we'll change it to 30 by 34.

141
00:09:23.248 --> 00:09:29.157
Now by default, we need to have
the close icon not shown, right?

142
00:09:29.157 --> 00:09:33.995
So, There are two things going on.

143
00:09:33.995 --> 00:09:35.935
First of all,
our close icon is also orange, so

144
00:09:35.935 --> 00:09:38.311
that's why we're seeing things
a little bit wonky here,

145
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:40.852
even though it doesn't look
like anything else has changed.

146
00:09:40.852 --> 00:09:44.940
There is a close icon being rendered,
it's just orange, so we're not seeing it.

147
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.921
To fix that, let's go back here.

148
00:09:49.313 --> 00:09:54.559
So first of all, we do want our close icon
to have a display of none by default.

149
00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.161
And I'm gonna put that
outside that media query.

150
00:09:58.161 --> 00:10:00.840
So close display: none, right?

151
00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:10.771
We also want specifically in the home or
index file here,

152
00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:16.313
.home .close path we
want this to be white.

153
00:10:16.313 --> 00:10:19.537
So let's have that same fill color
like we do for our menu icon.

154
00:10:22.145 --> 00:10:25.382
Okay, so
we shouldn't see anything yet, but

155
00:10:25.382 --> 00:10:30.952
what we want to happen is when we click
our menu icon, our menu appears, right?

156
00:10:30.952 --> 00:10:33.227
Well, we want that menu
icon to go away and

157
00:10:33.227 --> 00:10:36.236
be replaced by that close
icon when our menu is active.

158
00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:45.881
Stack in our script here,
we're gonna add one more variable,

159
00:10:45.881 --> 00:10:51.540
call it close,
select it with a class selector.

160
00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.689
So when the menu icon is clicked,
show the nav.

161
00:10:58.099 --> 00:11:02.242
We also want to hide that menu icon
once the navigation is actually visible.

162
00:11:02.242 --> 00:11:07.915
So menu.classList.add,
we haven't written this one yet,

163
00:11:07.915 --> 00:11:12.097
but we will,
we wanna hide that menu, right?

164
00:11:12.097 --> 00:11:13.750
Let's go ahead and add that.

165
00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:23.733
And we only need this width of 840,
so .menu--hide,

166
00:11:23.733 --> 00:11:26.807
this will be display: none, right?

167
00:11:26.807 --> 00:11:30.203
So there we go, we wanna hide that
menu icon when the nav is visible.

168
00:11:30.203 --> 00:11:32.953
And the last one we wanna do is
show that close icon, right?

169
00:11:32.953 --> 00:11:36.764
So close.classList.add, and

170
00:11:36.764 --> 00:11:41.531
we'll call you close--show, right?

171
00:11:41.531 --> 00:11:44.922
And close--show is gonna do the same
thing with that menu icon did,

172
00:11:44.922 --> 00:11:46.158
which is display block.

173
00:11:50.134 --> 00:11:51.639
Where are you?

174
00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:59.965
menu, okay, .close--show display: block.

175
00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:04.113
Okay, let's see if it works, it does work.

176
00:12:04.113 --> 00:12:08.415
Okay, so walking through what we just did,
cuz it was a little bit quick, right?

177
00:12:08.415 --> 00:12:13.661
&gt;&gt; I noticed you're using block here,
can we use visible too?

178
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:14.785
&gt;&gt; Display visible?

179
00:12:14.785 --> 00:12:15.999
&gt;&gt; Yap.

180
00:12:15.999 --> 00:12:23.594
&gt;&gt; I don't think display has
a visible value, display css.

181
00:12:23.594 --> 00:12:25.004
&gt;&gt; Or is it visible?

182
00:12:25.004 --> 00:12:28.723
&gt;&gt; Let's see,
I'm pretty sure it doesn't have visible.

183
00:12:28.723 --> 00:12:30.648
&gt;&gt; Visible show,
I think it's visible show.

184
00:12:30.648 --> 00:12:32.104
&gt;&gt; Are you talking about visibility?

185
00:12:32.104 --> 00:12:33.701
&gt;&gt; Yeah, visibility-
&gt;&gt; So-

186
00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:34.389
&gt;&gt; Sure.

187
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:38.765
&gt;&gt; The difference between display
block and display visibility,

188
00:12:38.765 --> 00:12:43.302
display none versus visibility
hidden is that display none should

189
00:12:43.302 --> 00:12:45.666
remove that from the DOM, right?

190
00:12:45.666 --> 00:12:49.874
And that's good because we don't want
our screen readers to be like, hey,

191
00:12:49.874 --> 00:12:52.586
there's an icon here,
or button here, right?

192
00:12:52.586 --> 00:12:56.868
And as a note, lwe're using SVG icons and
setting click handlers on them.

193
00:12:56.868 --> 00:12:59.268
Realistically, we should
have button elements, right?

194
00:12:59.268 --> 00:13:00.580
It's completing an action and

195
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:03.917
the most accessible solution here is to
have a button wrapping around the SVG.

196
00:13:03.917 --> 00:13:06.923
So just be aware of that,
I should have done that.

197
00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:10.661
Yeah, but that was a great question, yeah.

198
00:13:10.661 --> 00:13:14.750
You can use visibility, it's just that
screen readers might acknowledge it.

199
00:13:17.001 --> 00:13:20.791
Absolutely, okay, so now our nav
is visible, our X icon is there,

200
00:13:20.791 --> 00:13:23.600
now we just kinda have to do the opposite,
right?

201
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.457
So when our close icon is clicked, let's
go back to the state we were in before

202
00:13:28.457 --> 00:13:32.523
with that menu icon, so
we'll just kinda do the opposite here.

203
00:13:32.523 --> 00:13:36.854
close.addEventListener, so
we're gonna click,

204
00:13:36.854 --> 00:13:42.061
kinda just wanna do the opposite
of everything we just did?

205
00:13:42.061 --> 00:13:44.868
I'm just gonna copy and paste this and
kind of reverse the logic here.

206
00:13:44.868 --> 00:13:49.540
So when we click our close button,
we wanna remove nav--visible,

207
00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:51.804
we want to remove menu--hide.

208
00:13:54.773 --> 00:13:57.076
We want to remove close--show.

209
00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:01.606
So now we're seeing that, right?

210
00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:03.009
Reversing our logic.
