WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.366
What of if we use min-width?

2
00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:03.387
&gt;&gt; Why don't we use min-width?

3
00:00:03.387 --> 00:00:04.264
&gt;&gt; min-width, yeah.

4
00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:13.529
&gt;&gt; I think we can, so let's try to set it.

5
00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:22.531
On here, right now,
this has a width of 310.

6
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:28.430
Let's say we want a min-width,
I wanna put it on all of the wrappers,

7
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.792
they all get a min-width.

8
00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:35.911
It was 310, let's set it to 380, right?

9
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.012
So we can.

10
00:00:38.012 --> 00:00:41.252
I think at a certain point,
so it stopped at 310.

11
00:00:41.252 --> 00:00:44.008
You know why it stopped at 310?

12
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:48.084
Because that's what we defined as
the dimensions for our speaker photo.

13
00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:49.656
So that's why we're getting that.

14
00:00:49.656 --> 00:00:51.885
You can use min-width, absolutely.

15
00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:56.757
But now, I'm fine with it stopping at 310.

16
00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:59.329
What we wanna do now is make sure
that these are not getting truncated.

17
00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.598
So this is where our media
queries are coming into play.

18
00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:07.358
So we can actually change our grid layout,
right, when the screen is too small.

19
00:01:07.358 --> 00:01:11.242
So when the window is, let's say, when
you have the dev tools open and grow, and

20
00:01:11.242 --> 00:01:13.639
you resize the window you
can see in the top right,

21
00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.410
you're seeing those dimensions
of the browser window.

22
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.586
It makes it a little easier to debug,
right?

23
00:01:18.586 --> 00:01:24.961
So technically, it gets cut off at
like 977 pixels, but it's not nice.

24
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:27.146
So I'll say, at 1,000 pixels,

25
00:01:27.146 --> 00:01:30.776
let's make some adjustments to
our grid layout here, right?

26
00:01:30.776 --> 00:01:35.270
What does that look like when
it comes to media queries?

27
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.802
Well, let's test it out for a second here.

28
00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:42.075
We use media queries like this
with the @media directive.

29
00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:44.656
We say, let's say max-width.

30
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.153
And I actually, I have a couple
slides that illustrate this.

31
00:01:54.153 --> 00:01:56.201
Now, we're in the responsive layout,
we're almost done.

32
00:01:56.201 --> 00:01:56.950
We're almost done.

33
00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.578
Media queries allow us to apply
styles based on device type or

34
00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.151
other characteristics.

35
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.163
So some of the ones that you might see,
aspect ratio, device orientation,

36
00:02:06.163 --> 00:02:08.369
whether that's landscape or portrait.

37
00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.166
There's a prefers-reduced
motion media query.

38
00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:15.922
This is fantastic for accessibility for
users that they can't look at

39
00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:19.725
things online that have a lot
of moving pieces, right?

40
00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:20.989
It makes them motion sick.

41
00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.641
Prefers-color-scheme, if someone needs
a specific color palette to be accessible.

42
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:28.558
And then min-width and max-width.

43
00:02:28.558 --> 00:02:32.394
Min-width and max-width,
I always get them confused intuitively.

44
00:02:32.394 --> 00:02:33.777
They just don't make a lot
[LAUGH] of sense to me.

45
00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:35.931
So I've illustrated this example.

46
00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:39.532
So we've got @media, max-width 800 pixels.

47
00:02:39.532 --> 00:02:44.392
The styles will be applied if
the browser viewport is less than or

48
00:02:44.392 --> 00:02:46.914
equal to 800 pixels, right?

49
00:02:46.914 --> 00:02:51.587
In contrast, min-width,
800 pixels will apply styles of

50
00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:56.362
the browser viewport is greater than or
equal to 800 pixels.

51
00:02:56.362 --> 00:03:00.559
And we don't have to limit
ourselves to just one media query,

52
00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:04.604
we can use the and
keyword to apply multiple media queries.

53
00:03:06.835 --> 00:03:09.275
So let's go back here.

54
00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:19.772
We want to have a new grid layout when
we reach that 1000 pixels, right?

55
00:03:19.772 --> 00:03:22.830
So to illustrate this concept,
let's try this.

56
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.615
Let's say max-with 1,000 pixels,
let's see what that does.

57
00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:28.633
Let's just change the body color.

58
00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:31.816
Let's say, body, background, blue.

59
00:03:31.816 --> 00:03:36.674
Let's make it real obvious when we
hit that break point, all right?

60
00:03:40.574 --> 00:03:45.061
[LAUGH] Body-secondary is overriding that.

61
00:03:45.061 --> 00:03:46.620
Specificity issues, right?

62
00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.440
I'm trying to set a style
using a type selector, but

63
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.656
there's something more
specific that's overriding it.

64
00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:58.856
So, Let's just copy that name, right?

65
00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:01.955
It's body-secondary, let's try that.

66
00:04:01.955 --> 00:04:02.971
I'll just type it.

67
00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:11.143
Body--secondary, well look at that,
specificity.

68
00:04:11.143 --> 00:04:13.330
This is why it's important?

69
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.916
Right, so now,
when we hit a width on our viewport that

70
00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:21.923
is below 1,000 pixels, our body is blue.

71
00:04:21.923 --> 00:04:24.179
There is an alternative
to using max-width here.

72
00:04:24.179 --> 00:04:29.282
What we could do is say,
width is less than 1,000 pixels.

73
00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:34.163
This is a little easier,
at least for me to read personally,

74
00:04:34.163 --> 00:04:36.567
and that also works, right?

75
00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:39.678
So obviously, we don't wanna change
our body color to blue here.

76
00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:41.749
So let's go ahead.

77
00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.588
And my inner, this is in the base file.

78
00:04:43.588 --> 00:04:48.221
I'm gonna put this back in speakers,
cuz it was not a file issue here, right?

79
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:52.188
So what I wanna do instead,
if I hit this viewport,

80
00:04:52.188 --> 00:04:56.267
I don't want two cards per row,
it's too crowded.

81
00:04:56.267 --> 00:04:59.171
So let's just do one per row.

82
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:02.800
So all we need to do here
on our speakers wrapper,

83
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.149
which is where we've defined
our grid template columns.

84
00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:09.877
Instead of two columns,
let's just say it's one.

85
00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:14.617
Okay, look at that.

86
00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:21.778
So now, anything lower than 1,000 pixels,
now we've got one column.

87
00:05:21.778 --> 00:05:24.900
So I wanna quickly address,
someone in the chat brought

88
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.753
up a really great point that the first
card here, the first wrapper,

89
00:05:28.753 --> 00:05:32.960
there's something going on spacing-wise
with the name and the company.

90
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.605
So thank you for noting that.

91
00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:41.225
It seems like I forgot to add the class
name to the first name element, so

92
00:05:41.225 --> 00:05:43.307
I'm gonna go ahead and do that.

93
00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:48.823
Speaker, name, and thank you to whoever
noticed that, because I did not.

94
00:05:48.823 --> 00:05:50.155
Everything looks pretty good now.

95
00:05:50.155 --> 00:05:54.348
Okay, we are in the home run here
if you stuck with me thus far.

96
00:05:54.348 --> 00:05:58.295
Even if you haven't, thank you.

97
00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:04.418
Right now, we're going to finish up
this page by making it responsive.

98
00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:07.541
So we've seen how we can
change styles depending on

99
00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:09.873
the window size using media queries.

100
00:06:09.873 --> 00:06:13.696
Let's make some additional tweaks for
smaller viewport sizes, right?

101
00:06:13.696 --> 00:06:19.392
So, Let's see here,

102
00:06:19.392 --> 00:06:23.332
at around, click go back to our homepage.

103
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.448
This is a big font,
we're getting a smaller viewport here.

104
00:06:30.448 --> 00:06:36.445
So around 1,220 pixels, I'm gonna
go ahead and change this port size.

105
00:06:36.445 --> 00:06:41.433
So back in our home file here,
We open Home,

106
00:06:45.556 --> 00:06:50.316
Okay, back in our home file,
I'm gonna add some media queries to make

107
00:06:50.316 --> 00:06:53.955
this font less abrasive on
smaller viewport widths.

108
00:06:53.955 --> 00:07:00.617
So media max-width,
let's say 1,220 pixels.

109
00:07:00.617 --> 00:07:04.154
I want that main heading
to be a little bit smaller.

110
00:07:04.154 --> 00:07:08.661
So we change the font-size
here to 70 pixels, right?

111
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:10.227
Okay, that's looking a little bit better.

112
00:07:10.227 --> 00:07:15.734
So we've got the big jumbotron font here,
1,220 pixels, it's a little bit smaller.

113
00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:19.526
Okay, let's keep going
until we break things.

114
00:07:19.526 --> 00:07:22.702
This is how I designed
my responsive sites.

115
00:07:22.702 --> 00:07:25.004
I heard this from someone,
but it was basically like,

116
00:07:25.004 --> 00:07:28.068
make the window smaller until something
breaks and then fix it, right?

117
00:07:29.431 --> 00:07:34.151
So this is all looking fine, it's
looking fine, okay, it's still scaling.

118
00:07:34.151 --> 00:07:37.383
Okay, maybe it's getting
a little bit crowded in here, so

119
00:07:37.383 --> 00:07:38.878
let's change this again.

120
00:07:38.878 --> 00:07:41.400
Let's make this font size
a little bit smaller now.

121
00:07:44.132 --> 00:07:45.633
Let's add another media query.

122
00:07:48.627 --> 00:07:54.319
Max-width, let's say, 590,
let's see how that looks.

123
00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:58.812
We're gonna have the same selector here
for the main heading, and instead of 70,

124
00:07:58.812 --> 00:07:59.963
let's make it 40.

125
00:08:03.243 --> 00:08:06.005
Okay, so smaller, is this perfect?

126
00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:08.656
No, but just remember, I'm not a designer.

127
00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:11.764
So someone [LAUGH] would probably
come in here and change that, but

128
00:08:11.764 --> 00:08:14.261
this is all really just for
the experience, right?

129
00:08:14.261 --> 00:08:19.219
Additionally, at this viewport width, that
subheading is now a little bit too large,

130
00:08:19.219 --> 00:08:21.164
so I'm gonna change that as well.

131
00:08:21.164 --> 00:08:25.370
So we'll do .home .main_sub-heading,

132
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:30.913
we'll make this font-size,
let's say, 24, right?

133
00:08:30.913 --> 00:08:36.057
Okay, not terrible, and our base file,
which is where we've written our buttons,

134
00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:40.783
we obviously need to do a little bit of
work, cuz that's looking kinda silly.

135
00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:48.341
So back in our base file here,
Let's add another media query.

136
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:53.011
Let's go back to the 1,220 pixels,
so max-width 1,220 pixels, right?

137
00:08:55.035 --> 00:09:00.518
That's where we had our first break
point for the header text, right, 1220.

138
00:09:00.518 --> 00:09:04.322
Those buttons are taking up way too
much real estate, so let's fix that.

139
00:09:05.736 --> 00:09:09.368
Let's say, let's change the font-size
first and foremost to 24.

140
00:09:12.332 --> 00:09:15.882
Okay, let's also change the padding.

141
00:09:15.882 --> 00:09:17.649
Now that the font is smaller,
we maybe don't need so

142
00:09:17.649 --> 00:09:18.824
much padding inside that button.

143
00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:20.092
So let's change that.

144
00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:27.028
0, top and bottom padding, and
32, left and right, right?

145
00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:28.303
Okay, looks a little better.

146
00:09:28.303 --> 00:09:31.376
Last thing I'm gonna do on those buttons
is just give it a smaller height.

147
00:09:31.376 --> 00:09:35.493
They don't need to be, I think it was
100 before, they don't need to be 100.

148
00:09:35.493 --> 00:09:40.829
That looks a little bit better,
fits with the viewport a little nicer.

149
00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:44.663
Also, that arrow is ginormous
now compared to the text.

150
00:09:44.663 --> 00:09:47.527
So we'll just go ahead and target that
as well, make that a little bit smaller.

151
00:09:47.527 --> 00:09:54.792
So button image, let's give it a width of
20 pixels, that's a little bit better.

152
00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:58.050
Okay, so let's reduce this a little bit.

153
00:10:00.788 --> 00:10:05.447
All right, I had around

154
00:10:05.447 --> 00:10:10.089
a little over 800 pixels or so.

155
00:10:10.089 --> 00:10:12.255
Let's reduce the padding
around our main content.

156
00:10:12.255 --> 00:10:16.508
It's kind of a little bit too much for
the size, right?

157
00:10:16.508 --> 00:10:18.804
So let's just add this in here.

158
00:10:21.388 --> 00:10:25.846
Max-width, So

159
00:10:25.846 --> 00:10:29.451
let's just say 815 for the heck of it.

160
00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:34.415
On our main content area,
let's change the padding to 75 pixels and

161
00:10:34.415 --> 00:10:35.855
see how that looks.

162
00:10:40.336 --> 00:10:42.994
Okay, that looks a little
bit less chaotic.

163
00:10:42.994 --> 00:10:47.636
For the buttons, one last thing,
at this smaller viewport,

164
00:10:47.636 --> 00:10:49.969
let's go ahead and change it.

165
00:10:49.969 --> 00:10:56.715
Change the dimensions a little bit here
to fit with the viewport width, right?

166
00:10:56.715 --> 00:11:03.053
Let's say, @media(max-width),
say, 700, see how that looks.

167
00:11:06.341 --> 00:11:11.212
So button, let's reduce the font-size,
font- size, let's put it.

168
00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:13.776
So at a max-width of 700 pixels,

169
00:11:13.776 --> 00:11:18.078
let's change the font size of
our buttons to 16 pixels, and

170
00:11:18.078 --> 00:11:23.141
let's go ahead and give the margin
top to 24, so 24 pixels, right?

171
00:11:26.224 --> 00:11:27.393
So it looks good there.

172
00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:33.576
Admittedly, this looks kinda silly,
doesn't it?

173
00:11:33.576 --> 00:11:35.770
Why does that look so silly?

174
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:40.298
Now, I'm wondering what I was doing at
the time that I was writing my notes down.

175
00:11:40.298 --> 00:11:44.762
So we're gonna go off script, I'm gonna
make this look a little bit nicer.

176
00:11:44.762 --> 00:11:47.632
This looks a little bit silly.

177
00:11:47.632 --> 00:11:48.208
You know why?

178
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:50.558
Because I didn't actually finish
what I was supposed to do.

179
00:11:50.558 --> 00:11:54.488
So the button container obviously has a
massive margin that looks great at larger

180
00:11:54.488 --> 00:11:56.587
viewports, but not so much here, right?

181
00:11:56.587 --> 00:12:02.380
And if we go back to our design for
a second, Let me scroll this out.

182
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:05.993
If we go back to our design, you notice
here our buttons are no longer sitting

183
00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:08.709
side by side, but
they're on top of each other, right?

184
00:12:08.709 --> 00:12:11.465
So that's the last thing that we'll do for
this home page.

185
00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:16.899
So in here, let's move them.

186
00:12:16.899 --> 00:12:23.709
So remove that top or reduce the top
padding on the button container.

187
00:12:23.709 --> 00:12:28.579
So margin-top 32, right?

188
00:12:28.579 --> 00:12:30.859
Okay, that looks a little
bit less chaotic.

189
00:12:30.859 --> 00:12:33.309
And we want them to be stacked
on top of each other, and

190
00:12:33.309 --> 00:12:34.730
they're in a flex container.

191
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.258
So what we can do is just say,
flex-wrap: wrap.

192
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.543
There we go.

193
00:12:47.082 --> 00:12:50.964
They are not flushed with one another
though, let me get rid of this.

194
00:12:50.964 --> 00:12:55.797
In our design, they sit flush
with the text on the left here.

195
00:12:55.797 --> 00:12:59.569
So I'm gonna go ahead and fix that.

196
00:12:59.569 --> 00:13:02.198
Here's where it looks a little weird,
right?

197
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:10.327
It's because I set, there's a margin being
set here, that's a typo on my end, right?

198
00:13:10.327 --> 00:13:14.568
I don't wanna set margin on all four sides
of that button, I just want it on the top.

199
00:13:14.568 --> 00:13:15.879
So there we go.

200
00:13:17.763 --> 00:13:20.433
And now, there we go.

201
00:13:20.433 --> 00:13:22.387
Now they float on top of each other.

202
00:13:22.387 --> 00:13:25.069
Now, of course, like I mentioned,
I'm not a designer.

203
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:26.920
This probably could use a designer, but

204
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.433
this shows how you can add
different viewport widths.

205
00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:33.806
Go ahead and change your font size and
change the layout to fit that.
