00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.260
There was a question earlier around

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.700
text-aligned middle versus
justify content center?

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.470
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so
justify content is used with Flexbox.

4
00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:16.409
Text-aligned middle is used on text or
containers with text inside, so

5
00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:18.860
it doesn't have to be a Flex container.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.691
But that justify content,

7
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.650
anything would justify something
is used with Grid and Flexbox.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.656
&gt;&gt; So for instance, that arrow
positioning in the middle of the button,

9
00:00:31.656 --> 00:00:37.580
you could, in theory, use the justify
content center as well, right?

10
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.000
&gt;&gt; Well, let's try it.

11
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.125
It's a good question.

12
00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.230
Yeah, I'll stop talking and we'll just
see what happens if we try it, right?

13
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.736
So on our button, first of all let's
get rid of that vertical line,

14
00:00:50.736 --> 00:00:53.370
justify content center.

15
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.210
Look at that,
it's not doing anything, right?

16
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.139
Try setting display to
something other than block.

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.052
So, if we set a display of flex on here,
well now,

18
00:01:05.052 --> 00:01:09.400
JustifiedContent will
actually do something.

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.690
So display flex align-items center.

20
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.451
You could do it this way, absolutely.

21
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.781
But it just requires that you set
a display of flex on a button element,

22
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.112
which I don't know if there's a best
practice around it, I try to stay

23
00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:26.121
away from this unless it's really needed,
but justify content will only work, and

24
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:28.680
align items will only work
if it's a flex container.

25
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.095
So that's why I've used
vertical align middle,

26
00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:36.106
because I don't need to
set a flex container.

27
00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:39.274
Does that make sense.

28
00:01:41.357 --> 00:01:44.660
&gt;&gt; What's the difference between
align items and then align text?

29
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.730
&gt;&gt; Text Align versus align items.

30
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.494
So align items again,
is going to be for Flexbox and

31
00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:57.020
I believe grid has something very similar,
if not the same syntax.

32
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.060
Text align is going to be,
if you've got a div with

33
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.820
a paragraph inside, here,
let's just do it together.

34
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.267
So let's say I have a div, And
inside that div I've got a paragraph.

35
00:02:15.314 --> 00:02:17.770
I'll put some more mix and
text in here, all right?

36
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.052
So, this div, let's give it a stop it.

37
00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:25.930
Let's give it a height of like 100 pixels.

38
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.830
We'll give it a border so
we can see what that looks like.

39
00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.920
All right.

40
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.450
Got our nice little div.

41
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.450
We could do text align.

42
00:02:35.635 --> 00:02:39.025
I forget if this is the div or the
paragraph, but I think we can do it here,

43
00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:42.599
text align center look at that,
centers our text inside of our div, right?

44
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.390
If I tried align items in the center,
it's not gonna do anything.

45
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.030
That's because this is
not a FluxContainer.

46
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.610
So display, we set it as a FluxContainer.

47
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.097
Well, now it's aligning items
in the center vertically, and

48
00:03:00.097 --> 00:03:02.810
we can justify content center.

49
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.620
And that will move it to the center,
or it should.

50
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.380
JustifyContent.

51
00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.207
Why are you mad?

52
00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:10.610
It should move it.

53
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.420
No, JustifyContentCenter.

54
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.653
It should move it center.

55
00:03:24.316 --> 00:03:28.400
That's because this is a block element,
it takes up the whole width, right?

56
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.150
Like if I set an explicit width here
on this paragraph, let's do that here.

57
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.078
Let's say width, let's say,
I don't know, 75.

58
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.740
That's really small, let's say 100.

59
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.240
Okay.

60
00:03:45.377 --> 00:03:46.270
Okay, it's really small.

61
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.237
But the point is,
Did I forget the unit last time?

62
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:56.902
When this paragraph element
doesn't take up that whole width,

63
00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:59.940
which block elements do by default, right?

64
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.800
Then we can use align items and

65
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.455
justify content center if
the parent is a flex container.

66
00:04:05.455 --> 00:04:09.282
But when we remove this,
when the parent is not a flex container,

67
00:04:09.282 --> 00:04:11.590
these properties don't do anything.

68
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.350
So that is why we like to
use text align center.

69
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:24.510
It's to kind of avoid having to make
something a flex container sometimes.

70
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.520
Yeah, so vertical, align, middle.

71
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.910
Should move it down.

72
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.790
OK, well, now I'm freelance.

73
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.610
Now things, of course, are not gonna work.

74
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.505
I think there is a margin,
&gt;&gt; Someone asked about what

75
00:04:42.505 --> 00:04:45.040
is with align items baseline.

76
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, baseline has to do with,
I believe, the font.

77
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.806
So align items baseline.

78
00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:56.505
It's not something you're gonna see-
&gt;&gt; It goes with the V-align,

79
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:59.740
vertical align, baseline, bottom, top.

80
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it has to do with the font.

81
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.770
So here, Items are aligned such
that their baselines are aligned.

82
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.400
Do you see here?

83
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.190
They all have font and
all the baseline of that font are aligned.

84
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.247
So that's the difference here.

85
00:05:16.247 --> 00:05:21.184
They can have different heights, but
let's say the Texas in different place,

86
00:05:21.184 --> 00:05:24.660
it's gonna align the baseline
of those font families.

87
00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:35.201
So yeah, here's the example in CSS tricks,
the baseline of the font is aligned here.

88
00:05:38.359 --> 00:05:39.850
That one's a little bit more nuanced.

89
00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.419
You probably won't see it as often but

90
00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.240
it's good to be aware
that that does exist.

91
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.970
Okay, anything else on those?

92
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.500
Those are all really great questions.

93
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.150
&gt;&gt; I have a question.

94
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

95
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.171
&gt;&gt; I've heard people use the pseudo
elements after on buttons for

96
00:05:57.171 --> 00:06:03.060
images and icons,
is that you could practice or not really?

97
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.920
&gt;&gt; I think it's pretty common practice.

98
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.121
In terms of best practice,
I don't think it's as accessible for

99
00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:17.310
screen readers as using
like an SVG icon or a span.

100
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.531
Although admittedly,
now I'm questioning myself if you're even

101
00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:24.270
technically supposed to put other
elements inside of button content.

102
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.400
So yeah, that's a little tricky.

103
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.674
So using after, or button content or

104
00:06:29.674 --> 00:06:34.540
button icon, let's say,
adding an icon to a button.

105
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.090
We're back on our good
old Stack Overflow here.

106
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.160
I wanna add an icon before the text.

107
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.060
I don't know how I should do this.

108
00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.152
Let's see.

109
00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.150
You could add a span like I mentioned,
right?

110
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.851
And you can give it a width and
background image, right?

111
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:54.836
Or we could use that pseudo element after
like they're doing here, or in this case,

112
00:06:54.836 --> 00:06:57.330
it's before Setting the content here.

113
00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.450
So those are both ways that will work,
absolutely.

114
00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.630
In terms of best practice.

115
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.559
I'm not certain.

116
00:07:06.368 --> 00:07:09.778
But I always try to avoid using pseudo
elements if I can cuz they're kind of

117
00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:10.662
a pain in the butt.
