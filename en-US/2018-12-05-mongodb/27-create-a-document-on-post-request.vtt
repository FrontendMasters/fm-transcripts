&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
then if I wanted to create a note, so

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.956
if I did a post request to ('/note',

3
00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:13.460
asynch(req, res).

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.040
First thing is I'll do is I'll get
the note that is trying to be created.

5
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.894
So in Express,
we will get that on the request object.

6
00:00:20.894 --> 00:00:28.740
So I'll say notesTobeCreated = req.body.

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.230
So if you do an Ajax call to the server,

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.190
whatever you place in the body will
be added to this object req.body.

9
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.620
That's how Express works.

10
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.106
Other frameworks and
languages are very similar.

11
00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.817
So I got the note to be created and
then I'll just create it.

12
00:00:41.817 --> 00:00:50.754
So notes = await
Note.create(noteTobeCreated) and

13
00:00:50.754 --> 00:00:52.806
that's it.

14
00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:58.163
And then I'll just say res.status,
it's a post,

15
00:00:58.163 --> 00:01:04.029
so I'll be a good engineer and
do a (201) for a post.

16
00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:08.810
And then I'll send back the note,
and that's it.

17
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.080
So I created a note from the object
that was sent to the server,

18
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.340
and then I send it back
after I created it.
