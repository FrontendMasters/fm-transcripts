00:00:00.087 --> 00:00:00.935
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So knowing that,

2
00:00:00.935 --> 00:00:04.283
the first thing that we need to do is
we need to connect to our database.

3
00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:11.969
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So the way you do that is
actually pretty simple with Mongoose.

4
00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.529
So I'm just gonna make a new
file here called test.

5
00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.323
And basically once you install Mongoose
which is already installed for you,

6
00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:21.195
you just need to run mpm install,
you're already there.

7
00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:22.389
We're just gonna require it.

8
00:00:31.544 --> 00:00:33.491
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
it's pretty simple to connect.

9
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:38.023
The only thing you have to do is, I'm
just gonna make a function or connect and

10
00:00:38.023 --> 00:00:39.720
you'll see why in a minute.

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.047
Is you can use the Mongoose.connect
function or function or method here.

12
00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:46.955
And the way that you connect
the database as Mongoose is like

13
00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:49.759
pretty straight forward,
you just have to give it a URL.

14
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:53.582
And I'm just gonna give you the format
of what Mongoose URL looks like.

15
00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:57.024
The first part is gonna be the protocol,
the protocol for

16
00:00:57.024 --> 00:01:00.762
mongodb is gonna be mongodb,
that's gonna be the protocol.

17
00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:06.202
Just like in URL in the browser, the
protocol's HTTP, or a web socket is ws.

18
00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:11.338
For Mongo, it's mongodb, so that's the
protocol that you're gonna use for URLs.

19
00:01:11.338 --> 00:01:15.994
Once you've got the protocol,
you're gonna type in the host name to it.

20
00:01:15.994 --> 00:01:18.709
In this case,
because you're on your machine,

21
00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.769
the host name is gonna be localhost.

22
00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:22.083
So we're gonna say localhost.

23
00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:25.143
So we've got the protocol,
we've got the host name, and

24
00:01:25.143 --> 00:01:27.216
then you need to add the explicit port.

25
00:01:27.216 --> 00:01:31.976
By default, everyone here should
most likely be binding to the same

26
00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:36.581
default port that Mongo binds to,
which is gonna be 27017.

27
00:01:36.581 --> 00:01:38.933
That's gonna be the default
port that Mongo binds to.

28
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:42.998
You can change that if you want, but
I would just keep it there to save.

29
00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:45.753
Cuz if someone else uses this,
and they didn't set that setting,

30
00:01:45.753 --> 00:01:46.893
this is gonna be annoying.

31
00:01:46.893 --> 00:01:48.434
So just keep like that there.

32
00:01:48.434 --> 00:01:51.717
Unless, for whatever reason,
you just love that port and

33
00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:54.539
you got something else running on it,
then yeah.

34
00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.184
So once you have that, the next
thing is the name of the database.

35
00:01:57.184 --> 00:01:58.464
And you can put whatever you want here.

36
00:01:58.464 --> 00:02:00.181
Remember, if it's there,
it'll connect to it.

37
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:01.974
If it's not there, it'll create it.

38
00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:06.746
So you can put literally whatever
you want here, it doesn't matter.

39
00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:08.258
And now you're connected to the database.

40
00:02:08.258 --> 00:02:11.659
And mongoose.connect return to promise.

41
00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.887
So you can just put a return here.

42
00:02:12.887 --> 00:02:17.143
And now we have a connect function that
returns a promise that connects to

43
00:02:17.143 --> 00:02:18.058
the database.

44
00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:18.750
And that's about it.

45
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.080
There's this other option here in Mongoose
that has like different types of options.

46
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.189
And depending on what version of
Mongoose you might be running.

47
00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.226
All of you are running the latest version.

48
00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:29.062
You might have the passes
in different parameters.

49
00:02:29.062 --> 00:02:31.055
You might get some warnings
in the console that says,

50
00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:32.305
hey you have to pass this option.

51
00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.483
Just listen to those warnings and
pass those options.

52
00:02:34.483 --> 00:02:38.026
And like I said it is going to depend
on what versions of Mongoose and

53
00:02:38.026 --> 00:02:39.999
combination of Mongo that you have.

54
00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:41.663
They change it all the time.

55
00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:46.448
Sometimes Mongo updates, but
Mongoose might be lagging behind so

56
00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:50.646
you'll see a lot of deprecated
warnings in the terminal.

57
00:02:50.646 --> 00:02:53.406
Sometimes you can't do anything
about that, cuz it's not your code,

58
00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:54.565
it's Mongoose internally.

59
00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:58.101
So just try your best to adhere to those
warnings, but if it's like a deprecation

60
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:00.920
warning that you can't deal with,
then don't worry about it.
