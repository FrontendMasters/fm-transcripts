00:00:02.178 --> 00:00:04.265
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
so thanks for joining and

2
00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:06.160
coming into the MongoDB course.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.480
Super excited to teach your about
your first time using Mongo and

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.850
how awesome it is.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.240
So to get things started, the first thing
you need to do is hop into this repo,

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.390
which is gonna be at
FrontendMasters/intro-mongo-db.

7
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.367
And just a quick tour of
what's in this repo and

8
00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:24.251
how we're gonna go about these exercises.

9
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:27.284
Basically, this readme's gonna
have everything for you, but

10
00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:29.310
let's just walk through it right quick.

11
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.780
This course is basically gonna walk
you through the intro of Mongo,

12
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.210
we're gonna be using
in a Node environment.

13
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.764
And we're gonna cover things like queries,
creating stuff, different indexes,

14
00:00:39.764 --> 00:00:43.753
all different types of filters, so
we'll be working on stuff like that.

15
00:00:43.753 --> 00:00:47.330
And it's gonna be broken down
into different exercises, so

16
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.354
the repo is gonna have a folder for
every exercise.

17
00:00:50.354 --> 00:00:53.962
So if you click into the exercises folder,
you'll see different folders for

18
00:00:53.962 --> 00:00:54.750
each exercise.

19
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.850
And we'll be going through
these in a sequential order.

20
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.510
And I'll tell you which exercise that
we'll be working on at the given time.

21
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.268
But most of the time,

22
00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:04.642
we're just going to be following
the instructions in the readme.

23
00:01:04.642 --> 00:01:07.960
It's gonna have some command that you need
to run, some tests that you need to pass,

24
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.668
and some checks that
you have to check off.

25
00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:13.459
And that's gonna be, we're gonna be
talking about the stuff in that exercise

26
00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:16.760
before you get to do it, so
you'll have the proper context.

27
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.110
So once you have this down,
whether you fork it or clone it,

28
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.720
just get it on your machine.

29
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.990
Make you run an mpm install to
get all the modules installed.

30
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.040
Once you're good there, the next thing
we need to do is actually install Mongo.

31
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.417
So there's a few ways to install Mongo,
and

32
00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:30.842
it's gonna depend on
what machine you have.

33
00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:36.335
Whether it's Linux, Mac, Windows,
whatever flavor you're using.

34
00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:39.758
You probably are gonna be able
to do it from the source.

35
00:01:39.758 --> 00:01:43.790
And the creators of Mongo actually have
a really nice setup and tutorials and

36
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.260
documentation on how to install
it in many different ways.

37
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.977
So if we head over to their website,
at mongodb.com/download-center,

38
00:01:50.977 --> 00:01:54.354
the next thing you wanna do is,
you wanna click on Community Server.

39
00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:57.285
That's what they call it,
Community Server, that's actually MongoDB,

40
00:01:57.285 --> 00:01:58.165
the one you wanna use.

41
00:01:58.165 --> 00:02:03.300
So go ahead and go there, click on
the OS of your choice, for me, I'm OS X.

42
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.621
And from here,
looks like I have two options.

43
00:02:05.621 --> 00:02:10.293
I can install with Homebrew, which is what
I already did, I use Homebrew to install

44
00:02:10.293 --> 00:02:13.524
most of my stuff, but
you can also download by the .tgz.

45
00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:16.966
I recommend installing by Homebrew if
you're using Mac, it's just way simpler.

46
00:02:16.966 --> 00:02:20.965
If you're using Windows,
I recommend downloading the MSI file and

47
00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:22.377
going down that route.

48
00:02:22.377 --> 00:02:25.426
And they have installation
instructions on how to do that.

49
00:02:28.386 --> 00:02:31.203
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So once you have
Mongo installed on your machine and

50
00:02:31.203 --> 00:02:36.090
you're ready to go, the next thing you
wanna do is verify that installation.

51
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.038
So what we can do is, we can head over to
our command prompt if you're on Windows,

52
00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:41.560
or terminal if you're on Mac.

53
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.107
And basically, what you wanna do is,
you want to run the mongod command.

54
00:02:46.107 --> 00:02:50.942
And the mongod command is gonna start your
Mongo Database server locally on your

55
00:02:50.942 --> 00:02:51.671
computer.

56
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:55.174
I'm gonna run it, and it's gonna crash for
me because I'm already running Mongo in

57
00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:57.112
the background, so
it's a conflict of port.

58
00:02:57.112 --> 00:02:58.992
But once you run this for the first time,

59
00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:01.268
you'll see that it just hangs and
it sits there.

60
00:03:01.268 --> 00:03:05.552
So once you have that going,
you wanna open up another window, and

61
00:03:05.552 --> 00:03:08.703
you wanna run the mongo command,
without the d.

62
00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:12.018
And that's gonna open
an interactive shell like this.

63
00:03:12.018 --> 00:03:16.525
So this shell is basically an environment
that uses a hybrid of Node.js and

64
00:03:16.525 --> 00:03:21.390
some type of JavaScript and some other
pseudo language to interact with Mongo and

65
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.640
all the different
databases on your machine.

66
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.279
So we're just gonna walk through some
quick things to just get a feel around

67
00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:30.206
this shell and experiment with Mongo.

68
00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:33.462
So the first thing you wanna do is,
you wanna type in this command,

69
00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:34.811
which is gonna be show dbs.

70
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.517
So show dbs, which is short for databases.

71
00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.917
Once you run that, it's just gonna
list all the databases that you may or

72
00:03:40.917 --> 00:03:42.460
may not have on your machine.

73
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.491
If this is your first time installing
Mongo, you might only see these three.

74
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.971
These databases were created by Mongo,
and they store information about

75
00:03:49.971 --> 00:03:53.887
internal Mongo stuff, so
they weren't ones that you created.

76
00:03:53.887 --> 00:03:56.810
So what you wanna do now is,
you wanna switch to a database.

77
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.416
We don't wanna use any one
of these databases, so

78
00:03:58.416 --> 00:03:59.611
we'll just go ahead and create one.

79
00:03:59.611 --> 00:04:02.974
And the beauty of Mongo is that we
can create a database on the fly when

80
00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:03.800
we switch to it.

81
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.285
So what I can do is,
I can use the use keyword, and

82
00:04:06.285 --> 00:04:07.934
then put in a name of a database.

83
00:04:07.934 --> 00:04:13.043
So I'm just gonna make up one,
and I'm gonna call it todos.

84
00:04:13.043 --> 00:04:17.410
And this is not only going to create
a database called todos, but switch to it.

85
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.850
So you can see right there,
it switched to a database called todos, so

86
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.620
it created it, and
now I'm actually using it.

87
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.940
And to verify that, I can do
something called show collections.

88
00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.608
And actually,
you're not gonna see anything because

89
00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:31.631
we don't have any collections.

90
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.305
But this tells me,
because this command didn't error out,

91
00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:36.520
that I'm actually using a database.

92
00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.560
You can think of collections like tables
in C code, very similar to that, and

93
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.090
we'll get into collections a little later.

94
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.120
For right now,
just to keep this example going,

95
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.251
we're gonna see some of the different
commands that we can run in the show.

96
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:54.678
So to do that, we can just do db.help(),
and we can invoke it like a function.

97
00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:57.316
Cuz remember,
I said it's kinda like pseudo JavaScript,

98
00:04:57.316 --> 00:04:58.909
kinda Node things happening here.

99
00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.260
And you can see all the different
methods you can run on the database.

100
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.516
And there's some pretty
helpful methods in here.

101
00:05:04.516 --> 00:05:06.899
But again,
this shell is really just to test and

102
00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:10.429
play around with what's actually
happening in a Mongo environment.

103
00:05:10.429 --> 00:05:11.526
Some of this stuff right here,

104
00:05:11.526 --> 00:05:13.339
you probably wouldn't
really use in production,

105
00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.715
you'd use something like a GUI,
which I'll show you in a minute.

106
00:05:15.715 --> 00:05:18.651
So for things like creating a collection,
you can see,

107
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:22.666
there is a method here to create a
collection, and we can try that right now.

108
00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:29.609
So db.createCollection, and it takes
a name, and I'll just call it items.

109
00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:33.517
And you can see it said ok true, so
now if I type in show collections,

110
00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:36.274
I see that I have a new
collection called items.

111
00:05:36.274 --> 00:05:40.334
Again, this is just to play around and
explore Mongo, I recommend not using it,

112
00:05:40.334 --> 00:05:42.259
you can make a lot of mistakes in here.

113
00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.781
I'm prone to make a lot
of mistakes in here,

114
00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:48.900
especially if you're connected
to a deployed server somewhere.

115
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.569
So highly recommend not doing it, you'll
want to use a GUI to actually interact

116
00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:55.221
with the Mongo database
installation on your computer.

117
00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.574
It's much friendlier, less error-prone,

118
00:05:57.574 --> 00:06:00.419
it actually has a lot more tools for
advanced features.

119
00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:05.254
So here, what you wanna do is,
you just wanna click on the Compass tab,

120
00:06:05.254 --> 00:06:09.931
and MongoDB Compass is the GUI that
MongoDB, the creators of Mongo,

121
00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:11.720
actually created for us.

122
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.556
So it's free, they have a paid version,

123
00:06:13.556 --> 00:06:15.610
but you could just use
the Community Edition.

124
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.562
That's what they're calling the free
stuff, the Community Edition.

125
00:06:18.562 --> 00:06:23.260
So pick the latest version,
pick your platform, and download it.

126
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.790
Once you have that downloaded,
you can go ahead and open it.

127
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.423
I already have it downloaded,
so I'm gonna go ahead and

128
00:06:28.423 --> 00:06:30.391
open up MongoDB Compass Community here.

129
00:06:30.391 --> 00:06:33.755
And most likely, what you're gonna do,
I'm already logged in, so

130
00:06:33.755 --> 00:06:37.412
I'm actually gonna close it and open
up again so we can get a fresh version.

131
00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:40.362
So you can see it's gonna load like this.

132
00:06:40.362 --> 00:06:43.242
And once it does its thing and
it loads up, eventually,

133
00:06:43.242 --> 00:06:45.587
it's gonna ask you to
connect to a database.

134
00:06:45.587 --> 00:06:47.332
So you're gonna be
prompted with this screen.

135
00:06:47.332 --> 00:06:50.667
If you have databases already,
you'll see them on the left,

136
00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:52.410
favorites that you might have.

137
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:55.697
So for me, we're just gonna connect
to a new one, and by default,

138
00:06:55.697 --> 00:06:58.953
I wanna connect to the one that's
on the local host on my machine.

139
00:06:58.953 --> 00:07:02.140
By default, the port to every
Mongo database is 27017, so

140
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.919
I don't have to change any of that.

141
00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.844
So I can actually choose to go ahead and
just click Connect with all these

142
00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:08.959
defaults, and
it's gonna connect to local host.

143
00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:12.640
And you can see those four databases that
we had in the shell are listed here.

144
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.500
So the admin, the config, and local, and
then the one that I created is todos.

145
00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.280
So I click on todos, you can see
there's the collection that I created.

146
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.080
And once I click on that collection,

147
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.840
there's all different types of
things that I can do in here.

148
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.024
I can insert documents, I can do this
weird thing called aggregations,

149
00:07:27.024 --> 00:07:29.280
this explain plan, indexes.

150
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.030
So it's very useful,
has a lot of meta information.

151
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.861
And it's not just for local databases, you
can use it for deployed databases as well.

152
00:07:36.861 --> 00:07:39.666
So highly recommend using MongoDB Compass.
