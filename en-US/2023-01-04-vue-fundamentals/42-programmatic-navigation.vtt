00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.368
So for this next other part that
I wanna cover with view router,

2
00:00:03.368 --> 00:00:07.770
which is a very common scenario is we want
to talk about programmatic navigation.

3
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.965
Because it's one thing to just click
a link, but programmatically speaking,

4
00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:15.091
we need to be able to say, hey,
when a user does this thing,

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:18.307
check these things and
then send them off to a specific page.

6
00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:19.743
Very common.

7
00:00:19.743 --> 00:00:24.825
So wanted to make sure we actually covered
that as well as dynamic route with params.

8
00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:29.529
So, if you take a look back
inside of our playground and

9
00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.815
then let's go ahead and run that now.

10
00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:36.207
Rate, this is good, okay?

11
00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:39.480
Home to hide that playgrounds good.

12
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.631
Hide this, so we don't get confused.

13
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:46.259
Great, okay, so at this point,
what if we wanted to do

14
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:51.091
something like when local
count is greater than 200,

15
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:54.931
it will go ahead and
migrate them to Pokedex.

16
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:56.921
That's like a basic
chain that we could do.

17
00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:57.884
So how might that work?

18
00:00:57.884 --> 00:01:03.448
Well, if we look at our basic counter app,
base, counter, there you go.

19
00:01:03.448 --> 00:01:04.317
Here we go.

20
00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:08.963
Inside of here, this ones are not
using script setup just yet.

21
00:01:08.963 --> 00:01:11.627
Do we have one that's already using
script setup okay, that's only fine.

22
00:01:11.627 --> 00:01:12.487
Here's what we'll do.

23
00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:16.799
We will basically then do it inside
of here just so that it's easier for

24
00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.834
people to read.

25
00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:21.816
Okay, so inside of here,
we're going to import that count

26
00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:25.732
that local count from our
composable that we did earlier.

27
00:01:25.732 --> 00:01:28.613
So let me go ahead and
grab this use count.

28
00:01:28.613 --> 00:01:34.594
And we're gonna drop it over here for
our app, and then we say const.

29
00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:37.505
Count, store equals use count.

30
00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:42.282
And then we can say, do,
do, do, we can render out.

31
00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:49.036
Underneath here, the h2 that says,
counts toward local count.

32
00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:54.174
So what did it not like this time to do,
do do.

33
00:01:54.174 --> 00:01:55.040
Does it composable?

34
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.956
All right, hold up.

35
00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:59.971
We just make sure we'll switch all this
to the Alias to make our lives easier.

36
00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:00.708
There you go.

37
00:02:00.708 --> 00:02:03.500
50c file names, no longer routes.

38
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.060
You don't have to worry about
it anymore with that symbol.

39
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.174
Great, okay?

40
00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:11.600
So we wanna do is we want to be able
to say when the count goes to 50 or

41
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.355
we increment it, right?

42
00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:14.545
Let's go ahead and actually check.

43
00:02:14.545 --> 00:02:17.253
And if we want, we're gonna go ahead and
navigate the user.

44
00:02:17.253 --> 00:02:21.135
So what we're going to do is we're
going to import the watch helper method

45
00:02:21.135 --> 00:02:21.770
from view.

46
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.699
So we're going to watch what?

47
00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:27.335
We're going to watch,
count store that local count.

48
00:02:27.335 --> 00:02:33.309
And then what we get from this is a
function where we get the value of it and

49
00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.308
I believe I can just do it like this.

50
00:02:36.308 --> 00:02:39.380
So now to show that this works,
we're going to go ahead.

51
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.551
And we're going to go ahead and
increment it anything increment count for

52
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:44.703
this is a local one.

53
00:02:44.703 --> 00:02:49.580
So actually let's do global
count just to make our lives

54
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.853
a little bit easier here so
global count, save.

55
00:02:53.853 --> 00:02:55.455
So those are 200.

56
00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:58.893
We're going to increment global
count here, it goes to 1200, and

57
00:02:58.893 --> 00:03:00.454
then your your 1200 on top.

58
00:03:00.454 --> 00:03:03.495
And you'll notice that our value is
being printed out at the bottom as

59
00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:04.289
we would expect.

60
00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.945
So that's nice.

61
00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:05.925
So it's being watched.

62
00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:08.694
So what we want to say is that well,

63
00:03:08.694 --> 00:03:13.286
if value is greater than 1200,
what do we want to do?

64
00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:16.403
We want to navigate user to Pokedex.

65
00:03:16.403 --> 00:03:17.958
That's the pseudocode.

66
00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:18.885
How do we do that?

67
00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:22.411
Well, because we're inside
of composition API.

68
00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:23.171
And to be honest,

69
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.636
I think this is tends to be the easier way
going forward to use with you libraries.

70
00:03:26.636 --> 00:03:28.043
And this way, we're gonna do it this way.

71
00:03:28.043 --> 00:03:31.839
We're gonna go ahead and
import something from the router.

72
00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:34.945
And so if in the options API for
those from v2,

73
00:03:34.945 --> 00:03:38.859
you might remember something
like this .router.push.

74
00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.356
That should look pretty familiar.

75
00:03:40.356 --> 00:03:43.704
But there is no this context
inside of composition API.

76
00:03:43.704 --> 00:03:47.234
But what we do get though
is we get helper methods.

77
00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:51.034
Helper methods are basically the name of
the game when it comes to view three.

78
00:03:51.034 --> 00:03:53.979
So from the view router,
what do you think we called it?

79
00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:58.842
Well, it is use router
because what are we doing?

80
00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:00.812
We're basically going to call the router.

81
00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:01.577
So how do we do that?

82
00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:03.400
Const router = use router.

83
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.543
So we're very explicit
in what we're calling.

84
00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:11.697
And then here we can go router.push,
what/Pokedex.

85
00:04:11.697 --> 00:04:15.731
So then we refresh this now,
and we go ahead and

86
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:19.049
go global global swapped to polka ds.

87
00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.032
That's it.

88
00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:21.980
That's programmatic navigation.

89
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.321
Main thing being that, what do you do?

90
00:04:24.321 --> 00:04:27.802
You make sure you get the router from view
router that you can basically just like we

91
00:04:27.802 --> 00:04:30.880
did from the composable, it's a little
helper method that says, hey,

92
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.063
we're gonna help you do
some stuff with the route.

93
00:04:33.063 --> 00:04:37.395
You instantiate it here on line 10,
and then inside of either a watch or

94
00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:41.100
wherever you need to use it,
it really is just router.push.

95
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.358
And the push semantics come from as
well from I think the web history MDN.

96
00:04:46.358 --> 00:04:49.174
So again, we're not trying to reinvent
the wheel here this should feel familiar.

97
00:04:49.174 --> 00:04:50.810
&gt;&gt; There's a router now replace.

98
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.224
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's replaced as well so
if you go into the view router Doc's which

99
00:04:54.224 --> 00:04:57.653
again I highly recommend checking out
when you start to dive into that stuff.

100
00:04:57.653 --> 00:05:00.985
There's a ton of things that you can
do in terms of programmatic navigation.

101
00:05:00.985 --> 00:05:02.707
So we see there's push,

102
00:05:02.707 --> 00:05:08.368
do do you can replace the location you can
even use traversing history with the go.

103
00:05:08.368 --> 00:05:10.871
Again, we're not gonna play around with
all this because this is something you can

104
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:11.740
dive into as it makes sense.
