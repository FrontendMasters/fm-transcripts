00:00:00.124 --> 00:00:05.108
In real world projects,
could you go through and describe a little

2
00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:10.004
bit on when you would use a computer
to property versus a watcher?

3
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:14.342
&gt;&gt; So the question here is around taking
more real world example of why computer

4
00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:17.270
properties would be
advantageous over watchers.

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.688
So in the example of a data visualization
model I think that's still remains

6
00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:27.684
probably one of the better examples of
this in that if you were to try and

7
00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:31.685
take a look at any sort of SVG
animation out there chart.

8
00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.528
You'll know that for something like this,
there are a lot of pieces that go into

9
00:00:41.528 --> 00:00:44.358
the computation of how this
is being drawn, right?

10
00:00:44.358 --> 00:00:47.965
It could be as simple as how big the pie
chart is being drawn or what the data that

11
00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:51.201
goes into whether or not it's being
filled, what color it might be.

12
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.046
There's a lot that's happening here.

13
00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:56.495
And so if you try to watch all your
dependencies in like individually,

14
00:00:56.495 --> 00:01:00.179
what people have found when they worked
with sort of these larger code bases

15
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.921
is that if they weren't careful with
how they tracked their dependencies,

16
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:07.502
they could trigger re renders in their
code when they didn't expect to.

17
00:01:07.502 --> 00:01:10.997
And we, for those who have had
experience working on enterprise apps,

18
00:01:10.997 --> 00:01:14.100
there is almost no way you'll own
the code base from end to end.

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.600
So a lot of times you don't even know that
someone is depending on the thing that

20
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.576
you're talking like you're writing for.

21
00:01:19.576 --> 00:01:25.950
And so computer properties have the
advantage of because the chains are being

22
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.551
tracked basically explicitly via like,
so again, let me go back.

23
00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:36.081
When you use computed properties, not only
are you containing the dependencies which

24
00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:40.129
I understand watch does do like because
if we think about it when we did watch.

25
00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:44.525
You have to actually define the initial
value that you're watching.

26
00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:48.603
So in this case what let's it was
character let's say this character list.

27
00:01:48.603 --> 00:01:53.915
And then on top of that like can you
imagine what happens if you also like

28
00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:59.963
if this also had like this .character
list is dependent on this dot let's see.

29
00:01:59.963 --> 00:02:02.936
What do I have favorite list?

30
00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:07.040
Once you start adding multiple things,
especially when you're receiving data from

31
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.749
an API, it becomes really difficult to
start tracking where everything is.

32
00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:14.214
And so computer properties,
because you can basically just throw all

33
00:02:14.214 --> 00:02:17.031
your dependencies inside of
a single compute function,

34
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.436
it has the algorithm that's required for
you to automatically do all

35
00:02:20.436 --> 00:02:23.922
the performance optimizations and
caching that you would want to do.

36
00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:26.489
I think that's the best way I
could explain it at this point.

37
00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.960
And so remember the key thing
here is not that watch is bad,

38
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.698
is that watch is good for
triggering side effects and computed.

39
00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:33.985
It's kind of when you import low dash and

40
00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:38.502
you do a debounce function on an API call
cause you're afraid users will click.

41
00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:41.119
Like imagine compute it has
like a debounce built in so

42
00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.958
that things don't automatically trigger
like it knows how to protect you from

43
00:02:44.958 --> 00:02:47.476
those things that's
the advantage of computing.
