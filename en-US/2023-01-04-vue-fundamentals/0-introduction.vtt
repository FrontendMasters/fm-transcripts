00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.513
Welcome everyone to
the Complete Intro to Vue 3.

2
00:00:03.513 --> 00:00:04.690
My name is Ben Hong.

3
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.559
And I'm excited to spend the next
couple days with you as we go over

4
00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:09.799
the fundamentals of Vue and
just get you all set up so

5
00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.534
that you feel confident trying out Vue for
your next project.

6
00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.928
All right, so
as far as a little bit of a welcome,

7
00:00:16.928 --> 00:00:20.350
little fun fact I usually like to use is
I'm a big fan of amusement park rides.

8
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.650
So this is the one from
Orlando Universal Studios.

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.999
And so the one I really want to get up
though is if you ever go to Disneyland,

10
00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:30.592
check out because this is
the classic Jurassic Park one,

11
00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:34.030
they've re done the one in Disneyland
to be the Jurassic World theme.

12
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.644
And so they've done a lot of
really cool 3D, 3D effects and

13
00:00:36.644 --> 00:00:38.250
stuff highly highly recommend it.

14
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.226
If you're having trouble finding me in the
back, there I am raising my arms up there.

15
00:00:44.226 --> 00:00:47.680
But with that aside,
a little bit about me.

16
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.720
I'm a Senior Staff Developer
Experience Engineer at Netlify,

17
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.358
Vue.js Core Team Member, Nuxt Ambassador,
Vue Mastery Instructor and

18
00:00:56.358 --> 00:01:01.098
I'm a Google Developer Expert in web
technologies as well as my platform.

19
00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:04.361
All right, so if you're wondering
who this workshop is for.

20
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:07.998
This workshop because this is a complete
intro to Vue covers people looking to get

21
00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.298
started with their first
JavaScript framework for

22
00:01:10.298 --> 00:01:12.970
basically building web user interfaces.

23
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.572
All the way to people who are looking to
either learn about what makes Vue special

24
00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:20.120
and really gain the skills necessary so
that if they wanna try using Vue on their

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.400
next project,
they are certainly more than welcome to.

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890
And of course, everyone in between.

27
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.260
So let's say we have a good gamut
here of different experiences.

28
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.840
And so yeah, hope to cover all
that in this workshop today.

29
00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:36.360
All right, so a couple things
to know about this workshop.

30
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.262
Some things you probably wanna know if
you're watching this, and as far as,

31
00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:44.585
we'll call it prerequisites, is basically
if you have some familiarity with HTML,

32
00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:45.910
CSS, and JavaScript.

33
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.174
So in other words, you don't need to
be an expert in any of these fields.

34
00:01:49.174 --> 00:01:52.811
I designed it so that as long as you
have the fundamentals for each of these,

35
00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:53.870
you'll be set to go.

36
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.498
Familiarity with the code editor is also
super helpful as we'll be doing a lot of

37
00:01:58.498 --> 00:01:59.496
coding in this workshop.

38
00:01:59.496 --> 00:02:02.466
Because after all, while there's a lot
of theoretical things to talk about,

39
00:02:02.466 --> 00:02:05.346
I want to get your hands on experience
working with Vue to see how it feels when

40
00:02:05.346 --> 00:02:07.020
you're taking it for a test run.

41
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.910
The code editor I'll be using is VS code.

42
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.780
And I recommend that one
because the VS the extensions

43
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.910
that we'll be using also
are in VS code by default.

44
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.660
And so, if you can't follow along
with that, that'd be great.

45
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.779
But otherwise no worries if you wanna use
whatever code editor that you prefer.

46
00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.821
We'll also be doing a little bit with the
terminal as well because as most of you

47
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:28.450
know, when it comes to frameworks
build tools are a pretty big thing.

48
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.220
So as you have some familiarity
with running some basic commands,

49
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.910
that'll be useful as well.

50
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.880
In addition,
we'll be also using browser dev tools.

51
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.540
So I'll be using Chrome in this instance.

52
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.124
But whether it's Firefox or whatever your
preferred browser of choice is, basically

53
00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:44.080
we'll be inside of there inspecting stuff
and looking at how everything's working.

54
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.832
And finally, basic knowledge of git and
npm would be great as well because all of

55
00:02:47.832 --> 00:02:51.370
the resources are gonna be basically
encapsulated in the repo that I have.

56
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.805
And then we'll be installing
the dependencies with npm, so

57
00:02:53.805 --> 00:02:56.047
just as long as you've had
some basic exposure to that,

58
00:02:56.047 --> 00:02:57.782
you should be good to go for
this workshop.

59
00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:04.711
All right, and so the promised resource
it's everything is going to be living at

60
00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:07.498
this repo which is github.com/bencodezen,
and

61
00:03:07.498 --> 00:03:10.501
then /complete-intro-to-vue-3-workshop.

62
00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:14.141
So if you just go to /bencodezen and
repos, you should see it at the very top.

63
00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:16.834
And if it looks a little barren in there,

64
00:03:16.834 --> 00:03:19.980
don't worry we're gonna be populating
it as we go throughout the workshop.

65
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.670
All right, as far as what you
can expect from the workshop.

66
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.030
I'm a big fan of the workshop format
of learn, question and apply.

67
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.373
So basically we'll be going through the
process of starting with the learn step,

68
00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:34.764
which is every time we have a new concept,
we'll be going through explanations and

69
00:03:34.764 --> 00:03:38.200
examples so you can start getting
exposed to what's going on.

70
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.593
Then there'll always be
opportunities to ask questions, so

71
00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:41.974
if any clarifications, what ifs,

72
00:03:41.974 --> 00:03:45.820
that's a great time to kind of get in
there to start engaging with the material.

73
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.205
And finally, arguably the most important
step in my mind is that we go ahead and

74
00:03:49.205 --> 00:03:50.980
apply what we just learned.

75
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.033
So there'll be lots of
opportunity to do exercises, and

76
00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:57.541
most importantly I encourage you
to play and experiment with it.

77
00:03:57.541 --> 00:04:01.391
I'll provide some guidance regarding some
things you can do with the exercis, but

78
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:05.186
the more you kinda get into it, and play
around with it, the stickier it'll be for

79
00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:06.728
you when it comes to learning it.

80
00:04:06.728 --> 00:04:09.486
And finally,
even though we're here talking about Vue,

81
00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:12.540
an important thing to remember
is that all code is compromised.

82
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.452
So earlier we heard from people
coming from different frameworks,

83
00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:17.802
different frameworks have
made different choices and

84
00:04:17.802 --> 00:04:20.830
trade offs along the way as their
author sort of created those things.

85
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.810
So just know that whatever my opinion is,
I encourage you to question and or

86
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.180
disagree with it.

87
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.636
Because after all your opinion and
experience matters.

88
00:04:28.636 --> 00:04:31.796
At the end of the day, the most important
thing is that you choose what's best for

89
00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:33.814
you and your team in order
to serve your customers.
