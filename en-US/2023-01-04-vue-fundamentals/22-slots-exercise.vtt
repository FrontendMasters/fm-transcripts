00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.709
So if you pull down 08 exercise you'll be
able to see all the code that we just did.

2
00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:09.389
I want you to go ahead on your own
app create your own base layout play

3
00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.490
around slots see how you might want to
rearrange things see how that feels

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.103
when you have one slot versus having
multiple slot one name slots.

5
00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:24.591
All right, how did everyone feel
about playing around with slots?

6
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.930
Good, fairly straightforward.

7
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.326
That is great to hear.

8
00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:33.037
Okay, so what I'm gonna do is just
basically, I'm gonna take a look at

9
00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:38.060
the ATLLI forum on my end and we'll
just do a quick one as far as that goes.

10
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.106
So let me go ahead and check out a branch,

11
00:00:43.106 --> 00:00:46.379
08-solution cd atla.

12
00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.800
Great, run dev,
everything should be running as expected.

13
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.780
Yep, perfect.

14
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.180
Okay so when I'm looking at atla,
I'm thinking, okay, well,

15
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.950
base component,
what does a base layout look like?

16
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.885
So I'm gonna go ahead,
create my base layout.view,

17
00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.549
inside of here, let's keep it simple.

18
00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.390
So we're just gonna have the template and

19
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.180
all that it manages is
where things are placed.

20
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.910
So we'll actually just create basically as
to how many things we have four things.

21
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.762
All right, so let's do a div and
then we'll have here so

22
00:01:24.762 --> 00:01:29.202
we'll call this class grid,
and then we'll say,

23
00:01:29.202 --> 00:01:33.920
this is actually the same
open a style block.

24
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.631
And for grid will display grid, and

25
00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:42.208
grid template columns, repeat 2, 1fr,

26
00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:48.037
basically this will repeat
two columns inside of this.

27
00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:52.857
So div and div, and then for
now, let's just go ahead and

28
00:01:52.857 --> 00:02:00.355
drop this to make this a slot And
then we'll say the name for

29
00:02:00.355 --> 00:02:06.280
this slot is one this will be the first
one and then we'll copy this and

30
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.410
then just drop it in here for
two, auto complete just slot.

31
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.043
Thank you for catching that.

32
00:02:13.043 --> 00:02:18.579
Okay, inside of our app,
we're gonna go ahead, grab that and

33
00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:24.442
then this will be base layout,
go ahead and copy that base layout.

34
00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:30.301
Then wash it, call it here, and this
time in base layout we'll go ahead and

35
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:36.260
let's take our new character down here,
I think that's all of this stuff.

36
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400
And then let's just drop that
in the first slot to start.

37
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.330
So where are we here?

38
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.629
Okay, so we'll have the template here,

39
00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.580
dropping in the new character and
the the slot we're looking for is one.

40
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.198
So if you save that,
you'll see that we're actually I guess,

41
00:02:55.198 --> 00:02:58.492
let me show this so
that it's a little bit clearer.

42
00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:02.970
Five here solid green,
actually what's the fun?

43
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.249
Papayawhip love that one let's do it.

44
00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.596
[LAUGH] Okay, not very accessible though,
I like the name.

45
00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:11.372
Okay, so we can see here that that is
showing up on the left hand side and

46
00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:15.724
then all we need to do if you want to swap
it, for example, is just do the slot two,

47
00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:17.910
then you see it jumps from left to right.

48
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.987
So that's just a simple
implementation of a possible grid and

49
00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:25.294
you can imagine when start combining CSS,
slotting stuff around,

50
00:03:25.294 --> 00:03:29.141
you get some pretty powerful stuff when
it comes to responsive design as well.
