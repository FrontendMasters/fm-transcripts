00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.910
So as I mentioned, there's a lot in
the ecosystem out there waiting for you.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.633
Going past view, when you start looking at
things like server side rendering or you

3
00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:11.144
want a sort of, a higher meta framework
that provides more built-in things,

4
00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:14.880
highly recommend checking out Nuxt 3 that
should be coming close to stable soon.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.240
But we have a Nux three Foundation
workshop that actually gave recently.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.730
So if you check that out, that will
also walk you through how Nuxt 3 works.

7
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.190
And with the new Vue 3 knowledge, you'll
be able to pair those things pretty well.

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.753
In addition, whether it's
TypeScript as well, TypeScript,

9
00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:32.386
be sure to check those things
out because with Vue 3,

10
00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:35.975
TypeScript is much easier especially for
those using composition API.

11
00:00:35.975 --> 00:00:39.560
And so other than that I would say,

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.898
I think that about wraps
it up from my end.

13
00:00:43.898 --> 00:00:48.426
So a big thanks to everyone team here from
frontendmasters for hosting this, but for

14
00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:50.912

if you have any questions,

15
00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:54.195
I'm online in the community
under the moniker bencodezen.

16
00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:58.120

wanna reach out or have any questions,

17
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.419

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:02.672
Thanks.
