1
00:00:00.053 --> 00:00:02.509
So what is its history mode
that it's yelling at us about?

2
00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:06.461
History mode is a way to basically define
how you want your URLs to be displayed.

3
00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:09.685
Traditionally speaking, when you're
looking at the view router doc's, and

4
00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:10.561
we check it out here.

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:11.731
So, traditionally,

6
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:15.485
single page applications because
they're just the index HTML file when

7
00:00:15.485 --> 00:00:19.007
they're served the webpage,
they're known as WebHashHistory.

8
00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:24.360
So typically, what you would find is you
would basically see like the root page,

9
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.521
and then it will say
like router.vuejs.org.

10
00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:30.258
And then it'll do like
this hashtag symbol, and

11
00:00:30.258 --> 00:00:33.075
then it will basically do
the routing from there.

12
00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.457
The problem with that is
that it's not a true URL.

13
00:00:35.457 --> 00:00:37.257
And then there are SEO issues.

14
00:00:37.257 --> 00:00:43.269
So what most of us are used to instead is
what is termed HTML5 mode or web history.

15
00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.909
And that is, in other words, how you
would expect your URL to normally look.

16
00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.195
And so basically,
you need to define which one it is.

17
00:00:51.195 --> 00:00:54.966
So for us, we're going to go ahead and
just use the WebHashHistory right now,

18
00:00:54.966 --> 00:00:58.471
because there are some things you
need to configure for the HTML5 mode.

19
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.562
For that, I'm not sure we'll
have time to cover, okay?

20
00:01:00.562 --> 00:01:06.028
So inside of our router,
we have the history and

21
00:01:06.028 --> 00:01:11.223
we will say the createWebHashHistory( ),

22
00:01:11.223 --> 00:01:16.158
and that can be imported from here, okay?

23
00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:19.855
Now, that we have this, this should start
to feel a little bit better for the app.

24
00:01:19.855 --> 00:01:21.925
Look, already something is showing up.

25
00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:25.831
Let me go back to App.vue for
our playground.

26
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:29.097
And this time, let me go ahead and
swap the color out though to white, so

27
00:01:29.097 --> 00:01:30.797
that it's actually easier to read.

28
00:01:30.797 --> 00:01:31.685
There we go, okay?

29
00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:33.266
Now, we're good.

30
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.791
Now, you might notice though,
if we're looking here,

31
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:39.060
that this is where the hash history
is actually showing up, you see that?

32
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.500
It's already starting to do that,
but you might realize, wait, but

33
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.783
didn't need to find a homepage like,
why isn't that showing up?

34
00:01:45.783 --> 00:01:49.278
And the reason is because vue router
provides us some new built in components.

35
00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:51.947
That's going to make all the difference
when it comes to helping us

36
00:01:51.947 --> 00:01:52.815
manage the routing.

37
00:01:52.815 --> 00:01:59.070
So remember how in the seller view I was
manually switching the view on stuff.

38
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.545
So,we go to App.vue for sale view.

39
00:02:02.545 --> 00:02:06.239
Inside of here I had this component is,
that was dynamically swapping it out.

40
00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:12.735
Well, basically, view router gives
us a supercharged version of that,

41
00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:18.286
where we can actually just say,
okay, inside of my App.vue,

42
00:02:18.286 --> 00:02:22.405
I'm going to drop a thing
called router view.

43
00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:26.289
And if you notice,
my homepage has now showed up.

44
00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:28.376
And if I switch over to Pokedex, okay.

45
00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:33.023
So, we see some errors here regarding the
Pokedex, and that is because it looks like

46
00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:37.285
it has to do with the fact that there
is an asynchronous operation happening.

47
00:02:37.285 --> 00:02:41.141
So again, for the sake of demoing this
real quick because we want to focus on

48
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:42.744
the routing part and not that.

49
00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:46.747
I'm just going to switch the h1
over to Pokedex real quick.

50
00:02:46.747 --> 00:02:48.209
And then we can see here, there we go.

51
00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.115
We have that here, and we go back home,
that switches to the homepage.

52
00:02:53.115 --> 00:02:56.870
And that at its core is
how this all works, right?

53
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.643
If we build it up from scratch.

54
00:02:59.643 --> 00:03:03.778
And so now with the router view, you might
be thinking, well, okay, that's nice, but

55
00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:05.502
I don't have to memorize the links.

56
00:03:05.502 --> 00:03:06.509
That's not practical.

57
00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.803
I want actual links, so I can switch it.

58
00:03:08.803 --> 00:03:13.655
And so you might think, okay, well my
natural instinct then is to create a nav

59
00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:18.522
item, or I have an a href, and I'm
gonna go to /pokedex, and then pokedex.

60
00:03:18.522 --> 00:03:22.106
And then I'll have one for the home.

61
00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:23.827
Just like that.

62
00:03:23.827 --> 00:03:26.155
So that might be your first instinct.

63
00:03:26.155 --> 00:03:30.523
But if we do this and click on it,
you'll notice that nothing's happening.

64
00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:32.133
Because if we look up here,

65
00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:36.689
is actually changing the URL to something
that's not actually with the hat.

66
00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:37.574
You see this, what I mean?

67
00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:39.444
It's blinking out.

68
00:03:39.444 --> 00:03:43.137
What you want to do is actually be able
to say, it's actually on this side.

69
00:03:43.137 --> 00:03:46.187
Because why?
Because view router is the one responsible

70
00:03:46.187 --> 00:03:48.499
for managing that, not the browser.

71
00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.756
So don't worry,
it's actually pretty easy to do.

72
00:03:51.756 --> 00:03:53.574
This is actually pretty easy to do.

73
00:03:53.574 --> 00:03:57.297
Rather than using the native anchor tag,
what you end up getting instead,

74
00:03:57.297 --> 00:04:00.919
it's just like you have router view,
you have a router link component.

75
00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.664
And so, that is view router's way of
helping you to manage things like history,

76
00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:06.547
there's lots of stuff it can do for you.

77
00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:11.129
But the main thing though that's
different is that there's to property

78
00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.416
rather than a href.

79
00:04:12.416 --> 00:04:17.139
Because again, it's not truly an anchor
tag, it is doing some programmatic stuff

80
00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.459
underneath the hood to help
you move to the desired pages.

81
00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.230
So save that.

82
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.353
And this time, when we swap over, you can
see that it's actually doing it correctly.

83
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.067
So, if we think about the router view,
it really just like the dynamic component.

84
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:40.108
It's just swapping in and out components,
and then we have that really nice

85
00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:45.809
user experience of having it already be
basically automatically configured for us.

86
00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:50.089
The one thing I will note in case you're
wondering is that you're probably thinking

87
00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.848
that was a decent amount of setup.

88
00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:53.197
Well, I want you to know.

89
00:04:53.197 --> 00:04:54.764
So I'm going to go ahead and
show you this real quick.

90
00:04:54.764 --> 00:04:56.235
This won't be committed
as part of the code.

91
00:04:58.887 --> 00:05:03.149
If we go ahead and
run the npm create vue three.

92
00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:08.370
Oops, that was the wrong version, okay.

93
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.306
You might remember that there's actually
the opportunity to actually add view

94
00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:14.253
router as part of your configuration.

95
00:05:14.253 --> 00:05:19.510
We explicitly ignored it because it does
a few things which I'm about to show you.

96
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.069
So I'm gonna say yes this time, and
I'll show you what that looks like.

97
00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.187
So we look at the view project now,

98
00:05:27.187 --> 00:05:30.633
you'll notice that it actually
looks a bit different.

99
00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:34.842
It comes with more boilerplate now,
so you can see inside of main.js.

100
00:05:34.842 --> 00:05:36.948
The router is already being used.

101
00:05:36.948 --> 00:05:41.454
There already is a router.js basically
already created with all this base stuff

102
00:05:41.454 --> 00:05:44.379
already waiting for
you regarding like a home view.

103
00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.807
It has some basically some prefix stuff.

104
00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:50.020
It's even generated a views
directory with some sample pages.

105
00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.037
And so your App.vue out of
the gate is actually configured.

106
00:05:53.037 --> 00:05:55.427
To already use,
you can see the router link here.

107
00:05:55.427 --> 00:05:57.186
You can see the router view here.

108
00:05:57.186 --> 00:06:02.207
So just know that what I did is to show
you how you might do that from scratch.

109
00:06:02.207 --> 00:06:04.069
Most of the time,
you're not gonna be doing that.

110
00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:06.691
It'll already be configured for you,
you're going to go in there and

111
00:06:06.691 --> 00:06:07.452
make some changes.

112
00:06:07.452 --> 00:06:10.519
And so again, if you ever want a reference
on a clean way of how they did it,

113
00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:14.050
you can always scaffold a new project with
it, and you'll get everything you need.
