1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.651
So we're gonna go back to your index.html
page that you were playing around with

2
00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:04.518
your characters.

3
00:00:04.518 --> 00:00:08.167
And this time under each of your
character, I want you to go ahead and

4
00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.714
add a favorite button to it.

5
00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.165
And when a user clicks on that
favorite button, go ahead and

6
00:00:13.165 --> 00:00:16.838
update a separate list that
tracks your favorite characters.

7
00:00:16.838 --> 00:00:19.526
And as a bonus,
if you have some time, go ahead and

8
00:00:19.526 --> 00:00:23.626
actually create a form that will allow
you to add more characters to whatever

9
00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:25.568
the preset of data already exists.

10
00:00:29.843 --> 00:00:32.395
Cool, so what I'm gonna do now for

11
00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:36.808
the solution is we're gonna go ahead and
run through this.

12
00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:42.081
[SOUND] Okay, so
inside of my index.html file.

13
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.131
All right, the first thing we're
gonna do is we're gonna add a button

14
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:44.734
to each character.

15
00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.420
Well, we have our list here that we have,
and

16
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.914
all we're gonna do is I'm gonna do this.

17
00:00:49.914 --> 00:00:53.306
I'm gonna just for
the sake of making it easier,

18
00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:56.715
let's make the p element
wrapping around that.

19
00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:57.486
So we save that.

20
00:00:57.486 --> 00:00:58.729
This is good.

21
00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.899
And then we can then go ahead and
add a button.

22
00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.707
So that's just what we're gonna do.

23
00:01:04.707 --> 00:01:08.523
And I'm gonna add a star here for
favorite.

24
00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:10.355
There we go, we have a favorite button.

25
00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:15.803
Great, Now what we need
to do is actually we

26
00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:20.876
add a favorite character, so @click,
we'll say favoriteCharacter.

27
00:01:20.876 --> 00:01:22.412
We haven't read the method yet.

28
00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:29.108
So, we go down inside of our app here, and
so inside of data, we don't need that,

29
00:01:29.108 --> 00:01:34.272
so we need it here, so
we need methods for favorite character.

30
00:01:34.272 --> 00:01:37.063
And this is where the argument actually
comes into play, because at this point,

31
00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:38.349
well, there's a couple of things.

32
00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.444
One, we need a favoriteList.

33
00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:44.848
So I like to try to go alphabetical
whenever it makes sense.

34
00:01:44.848 --> 00:01:48.871
So favoriteList, that's just an array.

35
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:53.424
And so what we wanna do is wanna
do this.favoriteList.push.

36
00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:54.084
What are we pushing?

37
00:01:54.084 --> 00:01:56.508
We wanna push the character
that's actually being called.

38
00:01:56.508 --> 00:02:00.287
And so the way we detect this is we
go inside of our favorite character.

39
00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:06.371
And we're in our loop, so we can actually
pass character directly to our function,

40
00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:09.469
which means character now should be here.

41
00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.476
And can go ahead and push that over.

42
00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:17.528
And so to show that that works, let's go
ahead and add another list right here.

43
00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:24.076
This time we'll just add
h2 of favorite Characters.

44
00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:28.353
Once again, I see a typo there,
I'll fix that real quick,

45
00:02:28.353 --> 00:02:31.021
v-for character in favoriteList.

46
00:02:31.021 --> 00:02:34.844
And then inside of here,
we're just gonna render out the character.

47
00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:37.712
Okay, so as we can see here,
actually nothing's showing up.

48
00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:42.217
So actually, this is a good instance where
we might actually wanna do No favorite

49
00:02:42.217 --> 00:02:43.223
characters yet.

50
00:02:43.223 --> 00:02:47.647
So this is where the v-if works well.

51
00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:54.483
So v-if favorite characters,
or favoriteList.length.

52
00:02:54.483 --> 00:02:58.123
[SOUND] Actually, you know what, I usually
prefer the greater than 0 as my first one.

53
00:02:58.123 --> 00:02:59.515
So we're gonna swap this.

54
00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.896
We're gonna go down here and
we swap the v-if for the ul,

55
00:03:02.896 --> 00:03:05.368
cuz that's my preferred default state.

56
00:03:05.368 --> 00:03:08.426
And this empty state is really
a fallback for when it doesn't have it.

57
00:03:08.426 --> 00:03:10.673
There you go, No favorite characters yet.

58
00:03:10.673 --> 00:03:15.818
Vue favorite Toph, there we go, Toph,
Zuko, and Katara, everything's working.

59
00:03:15.818 --> 00:03:19.302
Now of course, you can do deduping and
all that fun stuff, but

60
00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:21.447
I'll leave you all to play with that.

61
00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:23.167
And then there you go, create form.

62
00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:27.647
Okay, and then let's go ahead and
add the characters as well.

63
00:03:27.647 --> 00:03:31.243
So what we wanna do next is we wanna
actually then add a new character.

64
00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:31.810
How do we do that?

65
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.847
Well, at this point, the easiest thing for

66
00:03:34.847 --> 00:03:38.306
me to do is let's go ahead and
create another h2.

67
00:03:38.306 --> 00:03:41.413
And this h2 will be New Character.

68
00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:42.194
And then what do we have?

69
00:03:42.194 --> 00:03:46.923
We have basically one attribute,
which is the character-name.

70
00:03:46.923 --> 00:03:51.383
And so we'll say name, and then we'll
have the input, and this will be text,

71
00:03:51.383 --> 00:03:52.269
that's fine.

72
00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.410
And then what we're gonna
do is we're gonna do,

73
00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.336
if we think about the data structure
we're probably looking for,

74
00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:59.805
eventually characters have
more attributes, right?

75
00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.635
So if we think about the reactive
data we're looking for,

76
00:04:02.635 --> 00:04:06.160
we can say there's gonna be a new
character object that we're basically

77
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.866
gonna be tracking inside of here.

78
00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:12.872
So with that, we can then say
v-model equals newCharacter.

79
00:04:12.872 --> 00:04:15.092
And you know what, we actually know
how we kinda want it structured.

80
00:04:15.092 --> 00:04:17.552
So we're actually gonna go
ahead by default, go ahead and

81
00:04:17.552 --> 00:04:21.032
actually define the name inside of the
data so we're clear to future developers.

82
00:04:21.032 --> 00:04:26.419
That is not an implicit thing,
and then newCharacter.name.

83
00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.005
And so to show that that works, what we're
gonna do once again is let's go ahead and

84
00:04:31.005 --> 00:04:32.195
use the pre element.

85
00:04:32.195 --> 00:04:36.040
And so the pre element is a handy little
trick to actually render your reactive

86
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.122
data in a way that's actually readable.

87
00:04:38.122 --> 00:04:40.253
So here, I'll show you the difference.

88
00:04:40.253 --> 00:04:41.892
So if we save here and refresh,

89
00:04:41.892 --> 00:04:46.321
you'll see that the name is actually being
rendered kind of in its codeblock form.

90
00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:49.757
But if you didn't do a pre element and
you just did the p element, for example,

91
00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:51.441
which is what I might do on my default.

92
00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:55.632
You'll see that it basically automatically
just renders it as a normal string.

93
00:04:55.632 --> 00:04:57.991
So the pre element, it's not as
obvious in this particular case.

94
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:00.703
But when you have like JSON
objects that's multiple lists,

95
00:05:00.703 --> 00:05:04.108
it's really nice to have it automatically
formatted with just using an HTML

96
00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:06.301
element without having
to do anything special.

97
00:05:06.301 --> 00:05:07.143
So there we go.

98
00:05:07.143 --> 00:05:11.080
And now if we come in here, hey, there we
go, look, things are actually changing.

99
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.784
So once again, if I say Appa, right?

100
00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:16.618
And then nothing's adding yet, why?

101
00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:19.739
Because we haven't actually had a way
to actually push the character to it.

102
00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:21.050
So how might we do that?

103
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.359
Well, for the sake of showing you all
something new, right, we talked about

104
00:05:25.359 --> 00:05:29.222
v-model and all that stuff, and
we can click on the button to add it.

105
00:05:29.222 --> 00:05:31.098
But what if instead,
we did something a little bit more fun.

106
00:05:31.098 --> 00:05:32.640
Let's not do a button this time.

107
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.843
What it you wanted to do a keyup, and
then when you hit Enter, then we push it,

108
00:05:36.843 --> 00:05:38.020
how would that work?

109
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.060
Well, we can actually do an @keyup event,

110
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.548
and then we can say
basically addNewCharacter.

111
00:05:46.548 --> 00:05:52.731
And so if we come in here, and we go
to methods, and we go addNewCharacter.

112
00:05:52.731 --> 00:05:55.524
At this point,
we do know what the new character is.

113
00:05:55.524 --> 00:05:59.134
So we don't need to pass any arguments to
it because that is already being tracked

114
00:05:59.134 --> 00:06:00.473
inside of our reactive data.

115
00:06:00.473 --> 00:06:05.005
So what we get to do is we can
do this.characterList.push.

116
00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:05.573
What are we pushing?

117
00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:07.924
We're pushing the newCharacter.

118
00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:11.284
And not just any newCharacter,
it's this newCharacter.

119
00:06:11.284 --> 00:06:18.129
So we refresh that and do Appa, you'll
see, that's weird, what's happening?

120
00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.013
Well, any guesses?

121
00:06:21.013 --> 00:06:22.070
&gt;&gt; Every keyup.

122
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:28.193
&gt;&gt; Yep, every keyup is just firing off,
is like, [SOUND] we don't want that.

123
00:06:28.193 --> 00:06:34.801
We only wanna do it when
we hit keyup Enter.

124
00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:38.183
And so some of you are probably thinking,
okay, so I know what I'm gonna do,

125
00:06:38.183 --> 00:06:39.339
I'm gonna get the event.

126
00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:44.496
I'm gonna do event.target, and then I
have to figure out what the key code is.

127
00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:46.086
But I got you all one easier.

128
00:06:46.086 --> 00:06:48.286
Yep, so now let's see what we got here.

129
00:06:48.286 --> 00:06:53.680
So we can do here, I mentioned
before about modifiers to the API.

130
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.439
On the keyup, Vue also knows we have
common things we're using all the time.

131
00:06:57.439 --> 00:07:00.264
An Enter, an Escape keys,
those are common.

132
00:07:00.264 --> 00:07:04.767
So all we can do is we do .enter on this,
refresh,

133
00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:09.184
Appa is fine, hit Enter,
and then there you go.

134
00:07:09.184 --> 00:07:10.997
The reason it's blinking is
because of that odd character.

135
00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:15.431
So actually, I think that
functionality is basically done.

136
00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:21.922
So that's [SOUND] don't do that.

137
00:07:21.922 --> 00:07:24.141
Right, I had that whole list thing,
that's fine.

138
00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:26.259
Okay, then if I just add it twice,
they go.

139
00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:28.025
Now you'll see both of them.

140
00:07:28.025 --> 00:07:33.517
And so the final thing just from like a
code cleanup perspective is probably just,

141
00:07:33.517 --> 00:07:38.472
once we push the character just
newCharacter =, just like a new object.

142
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.974
So just to prove that that works,
Appa, Enter, that's fine.

143
00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:47.325
Then we can say like Azula.

144
00:07:47.325 --> 00:07:49.214
There we go, Appa, Azula.

145
00:07:49.214 --> 00:07:53.030
You can see that our name
input is being reset properly.
