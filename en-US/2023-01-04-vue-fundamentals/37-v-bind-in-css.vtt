WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.401
Okay, but one other thing I
wanna tell you about styling,

2
00:00:03.401 --> 00:00:07.790
which most people don't know about when
it comes to Vue 3 is that this is great.

3
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.480
We have the ability to global styles, we
have scoped styles, we have CSS modules.

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.178
For me, one of the things, when it comes
to extending on the functionality of

5
00:00:18.178 --> 00:00:22.640
the web, is how we can bring
the technology together in a better way.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.864
And so JavaScript is really good at
interactivity, managing state, and

7
00:00:25.864 --> 00:00:27.880
dynamic pieces of information.

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.457
CSS is very good at what it does, styling.

9
00:00:30.457 --> 00:00:35.390
And so, what if you could find a way
to actually merge the two together in

10
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.612
a way that allows for
just crazy possibility?

11
00:00:38.612 --> 00:00:42.622
To show you what I mean, let's go ahead,
and I'm just gonna save this right now.

12
00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:46.209
And on the App.vue,
what if we wanted the ability for

13
00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:49.490
the user to choose what
the background color is?

14
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.805
Typically the approach for that is you
probably would come to your designers and

15
00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:55.640
you would say, okay,
these are the seven classes we'll support.

16
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.885
And so we'll try our best to just support
it this way, and so you're limited.

17
00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:02.836
But there are plenty of cases where you
might actually want to give the user

18
00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:03.938
infinite configuration.

19
00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:06.992
But the reason why we can't do that is
because, frankly, managing the CSS for

20
00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:08.890
that can be quite difficult.

21
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.450
So let's say, for instance,
we have that property.

22
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.974
So I'm gonna import a ref from vue,
and I'm gonna call it colorPreference.

23
00:01:18.974 --> 00:01:22.943
There'll be a ref, it'll be an empty,
actully we'll just say, black, for

24
00:01:22.943 --> 00:01:23.616
now, okay?

25
00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:27.948
And so what we'll do here is,
what you ideally wanna do is you'd

26
00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:31.572
like your CSS to be able to
read from your JavaScript.

27
00:01:31.572 --> 00:01:33.886
That'll be a perfect world, wouldn't it.

28
00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:37.252
Right now what you probably have
to do is some convoluted on load

29
00:01:37.252 --> 00:01:40.299
the document element,
then insert your own style tag and

30
00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.600
manipulate the inline styles of the HTML.

31
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.020
There's a lot of work that goes into that.

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.416
Well, what if I said, instead,
that what we could do is,

33
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:51.520
let's say on the app itself.

34
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.990
This time we're gonna
do a background color.

35
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.690
But this time, I'm going to actually,
let's see, let's try to just do this.

36
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.710
Will colorPreference work?

37
00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.650
Now, nothing's happening.

38
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:05.800
Well, let's make sure it's working first.

39
00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.716
So let's go ahead and do this.

40
00:02:06.716 --> 00:02:10.338
Let's actually render
out the colorPreference.

41
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:14.579
So colorPreference, now where is it?

42
00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:15.590
It's all the way down here.

43
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.064
Let's bump it up so it's easier to read.

44
00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:20.322
Okay, great, it is showing up.

45
00:02:20.322 --> 00:02:22.844
Let's make sure it actually can
get changed, that it's reactive.

46
00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:24.340
Let's do an import.

47
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.348
If you didn't know,

48
00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:29.045
there's a type called color on your
inputs that's actually built into HTML.

49
00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:32.479
And we can just v-model this
to our colorPreference.

50
00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.060
So let's see if this works.

51
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.782
Let's see, let's go this, okay, great,
so now we have this infinite color loop.

52
00:02:38.782 --> 00:02:41.635
Well, Vue 3 was like, you know what?

53
00:02:41.635 --> 00:02:43.518
I think we can make this happen.

54
00:02:43.518 --> 00:02:47.706
What if we just wrapped this in v-bind?

55
00:02:50.512 --> 00:02:54.954
And so, we get, shoot, we need to,

56
00:02:54.954 --> 00:02:58.745
maybe app is too far of a context.

57
00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.030
There we go, okay?

58
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.030
That context was too high.

59
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.560
All right, it's fine.

60
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.160
I'll just do the, let me do this.

61
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.500
Let me wrap this real quick.

62
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.680
Okay, so I'll explain why
that's not working real quick.

63
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.360
It actually does make sense.

64
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.040
But for the sake of showing this,
there we go.

65
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.234
Okay, What we can see here now is you have

66
00:03:20.234 --> 00:03:23.860
this infinite loop of
JavaScript updating the CSS.

67
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.956
Now if you're skeptical, you're like,
this looks like black magic,

68
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:28.083
what's happening here?

69
00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:30.356
All right, let me show you.

70
00:03:30.356 --> 00:03:31.622
Let me show you.

71
00:03:31.622 --> 00:03:34.044
I promise you, when we think about things,

72
00:03:34.044 --> 00:03:37.065
we try to think of things in
terms of extending the web.

73
00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:39.766
Look at actually what's happening here.

74
00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:45.234
What JavaScript does well is it says,
okay, I'm gonna create a custom variable.

75
00:03:45.234 --> 00:03:47.463
But we're gonna use CSS variables cuz,
guess what?

76
00:03:47.463 --> 00:03:50.107
That is browser technology
that is actively supported.

77
00:03:50.107 --> 00:03:52.629
And why would we try
to reinvent the wheel?

78
00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.332
And so all JavaScript's doing is it's
actually just tracking this variable, and

79
00:03:57.332 --> 00:04:00.975
just making sure to update that value,
but the rest of it is CSS.

80
00:04:00.975 --> 00:04:05.310
So you get the power of CSS and cascades
and everything in its native form.

81
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.139
But you also get the power of getting
reactive data that can impact

82
00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:08.815
those things.

83
00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:13.236
So you can imagine, the number of times
I've been on Azure I wanted to customize

84
00:04:13.236 --> 00:04:15.993
the font size or the padding,
those were hard to do.

85
00:04:15.993 --> 00:04:18.970
Because to create a class for
every single one of those scenarios or

86
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.162
to manage that at one
point was nigh impossible.

87
00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:25.525
But with things like v-bind
on your styles now, so

88
00:04:25.525 --> 00:04:29.183
many possibilities now exists with this.

89
00:04:29.183 --> 00:04:30.940
And so if you're wondering, though,

90
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.254
why did I have a little bit of trouble
with the HTML, I think, and the app?

91
00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:36.294
Is because, I think, Vue,

92
00:04:36.294 --> 00:04:41.140
once it takes over the div is
unable to go outside of it.

93
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.554
So that's what it is.
It's not in control,

94
00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:44.190
Vue is not in control of that area.

95
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.427
So if you're gonna do this, obviously make
sure that you're within the context of

96
00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.152
your app, otherwise the CSS won't apply.

97
00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:52.689
But otherwise at this point, you can
imagine just infinite user preference

98
00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.796
configuration that's possible with this.
