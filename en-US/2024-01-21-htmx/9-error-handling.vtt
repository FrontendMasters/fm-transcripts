00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.383
So there we go.
We have this nice little post.

2
00:00:01.383 --> 00:00:04.525
When we make a post,
this is what happens to our contacts page.

3
00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:05.507
This kinda sucks.

4
00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:06.854
Can we all agree that this sucks?

5
00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:10.561
This is not what I want to see at all,
right?

6
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:11.268
This is not it.

7
00:00:11.268 --> 00:00:13.875
This is not any of it, in fact.

8
00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:14.850
This is horrible.

9
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.935
And if I keep on adding, it'll just
keep on getting worse and worse and

10
00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:18.732
worse and worse.

11
00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:21.668
And look at that thing go,
it's just awful, right?

12
00:00:21.668 --> 00:00:23.043
So this isn't beautiful.

13
00:00:23.043 --> 00:00:28.434
I bet you, though, that a lot of
people can now guess what happened.

14
00:00:28.434 --> 00:00:29.217
What happened?

15
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.366
&gt;&gt; I have no idea.

16
00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.240
&gt;&gt; You have no idea, but
we have already solved this problem.

17
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.276
&gt;&gt; We're not targeting the div.

18
00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:38.241
&gt;&gt; Say it out loud, come on.

19
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:40.189
&gt;&gt; We're not targeting the div.

20
00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.918
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're not targeting
the right content, I love it.

21
00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:44.607
I know, right, John?

22
00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:45.759
I knew you were gonna get it correct.

23
00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:48.222
I could feel it, you were ready,
you were just there.

24
00:00:48.222 --> 00:00:49.963
All right, so yeah, that's exactly it.

25
00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:53.378
Look at our response, we're
responding with the whole darn thing.

26
00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:54.530
And what is it doing?

27
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.640
Who made the request in this situation?

28
00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:00.672
The form made the request.

29
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:03.222
So therefore, the form gets replaced.

30
00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:07.380
Even if we go to the HTML, we might see
that our form has a form, that has a form,

31
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.153
that has a form, that has a form.

32
00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:10.560
Our forms had babies.

33
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.168
Look at that.
Look at how many it had.

34
00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:13.688
So we did something wrong here, right?

35
00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:17.950
We need to start targeting and thinking
about, how are we gonna update this page?

36
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.845
And this is actually quite
an interesting problem,

37
00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:24.545
we're gonna get to the problem of form and
display all in one page.

38
00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:26.143
Let's see, I don't know what it says.

39
00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:27.167
Yeah, so let's fix this problem.

40
00:01:27.167 --> 00:01:30.143
So this is the same problem as before,
we're returning the whole thing.

41
00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:33.938
So first and obvious and easiest
thing we can do, if you're lazy and

42
00:01:33.938 --> 00:01:39.037
you just wanna get a product out there,
just hit it with the old hx-target="body".

43
00:01:39.037 --> 00:01:42.729
My goodness, fantastic,
I'm refreshing the page.

44
00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.173
Did you see how fast that compiles?

45
00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:48.069
Look, my goodness,
it's the easiest thing ever.

46
00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.406
Look at that, we're just adding stuff,
it's updating.

47
00:01:51.406 --> 00:01:55.067
Not a big deal, super, super simple.

48
00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:59.625
By the way, I just love how fast,
the compilation is just so good.

49
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:01.525
All right, is this good?

50
00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:02.797
What are some problems with this approach?

51
00:02:02.797 --> 00:02:05.327
Can someone give me a problem
with what we're doing right now?

52
00:02:07.524 --> 00:02:08.235
John.

53
00:02:08.235 --> 00:02:09.884
&gt;&gt; Are we sending the full HTML?

54
00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:15.097
&gt;&gt; We're sending all the contacts and
everything.

55
00:02:15.097 --> 00:02:16.153
What's the problem?

56
00:02:16.153 --> 00:02:21.918
&gt;&gt; I'm Chad, John says losing focus
if you are targeting the body.

57
00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:22.771
&gt;&gt; You can lose focus, yes.

58
00:02:22.771 --> 00:02:26.571
So there's an entire concern on focus and
all that kinda stuff.

59
00:02:26.571 --> 00:02:28.031
You can totally fix all those things,

60
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:29.951
we're not gonna be really
be talking about that.

61
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.699
There's obviously autofocus.

62
00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.059
HTMX, if a child component has focus,

63
00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.572
will ensure that focus is
retransferred to the same item.

64
00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:39.677
There's a whole bunch
of stuff around focus.

65
00:02:39.677 --> 00:02:42.785
There's also the whole
accessibility concern.

66
00:02:42.785 --> 00:02:47.572
We're not gonna be really focused on that,
no pun intended.

67
00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:50.774
Instead, we're gonna be focusing more
on just the HTMX side of things.

68
00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:54.044
Cuz that really is a JavaScript
slash frontend problem,

69
00:02:54.044 --> 00:02:56.029
it's not really an HTMX problem.

70
00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:58.579
Again, it's the same reason why
we're not thinking about styling.

71
00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.533
It's just not a problem of HTMX.

72
00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.085
&gt;&gt; The payload get bigger
the more trips that happen?

73
00:03:04.085 --> 00:03:07.312
&gt;&gt; Yes, so if you couldn't hear it,
the payload keeps getting ever bigger.

74
00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:09.405
Meaning if you had 1,000 contacts,

75
00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:13.548
we have to send down 1,000 contacts plus
a form every single time you add one.

76
00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:16.173
That's a horrible problem to be in,
we don't wanna be there.

77
00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:19.232
So we're gonna explore the space
just a little bit, okay?

78
00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:20.323
We're just gonna get in there.

79
00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:23.878
We're gonna see what happens because
this seems kind of exciting.

80
00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:27.830
Yes, I know some people are suggesting
the fix being Rust, 1,000 contacts,

81
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.422
not a big deal with Rust, right?

82
00:03:29.422 --> 00:03:30.230
Still a problem.

83
00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.674
Trust me, this is a problem,
let's not do that.

84
00:03:33.674 --> 00:03:36.261
So let's first start by only
responding with contacts.

85
00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:39.082
That should be a pretty
easy reduction of stuff.

86
00:03:39.082 --> 00:03:42.746
So let's jump back in here, and
we need to change two things.

87
00:03:42.746 --> 00:03:46.124
We need to change who are we targeting and
then the code that's being generated.

88
00:03:46.124 --> 00:03:49.034
So I'm gonna go like this, hx-target, and

89
00:03:49.034 --> 00:03:53.412
let's go down here and
call this thing id="contacts", right?

90
00:03:53.412 --> 00:03:56.417
And then we're gonna jump back here and
we're gonna go #contacts.

91
00:03:59.688 --> 00:04:01.418
All right, awesome.

92
00:04:01.418 --> 00:04:04.525
So now that we have that,
that should do all the redirecting.

93
00:04:04.525 --> 00:04:07.994
So now we're gonna go over to
the server and we need to say, hey,

94
00:04:07.994 --> 00:04:11.098
don't render the index,
render the contacts, right?

95
00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:13.255
Or wait, I call it display.

96
00:04:13.255 --> 00:04:14.555
Did I call it display?

97
00:04:14.555 --> 00:04:15.795
Yeah, I called it display.

98
00:04:15.795 --> 00:04:17.705
Terrible name, but you get the idea.

99
00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:20.302
Okay, awesome, we're gonna do that.

100
00:04:20.302 --> 00:04:24.791
So I'm going to refresh this,
and let's add a contact.

101
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:27.108
Okay, I mean, that's better, right?

102
00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:31.606
We're getting better,
I'm just creating so many sweet contacts.

103
00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:33.033
Is this better?

104
00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:34.427
In some sense, it's better.

105
00:04:34.427 --> 00:04:36.766
But let's take a little
gander at what's happening.

106
00:04:36.766 --> 00:04:43.838
Look at what happened here,
we're having multiple levels of contacts.

107
00:04:43.838 --> 00:04:45.796
Why is that?

108
00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:49.204
Can anyone tell me why we're having
multiple levels of contacts?

109
00:04:49.204 --> 00:04:50.972
&gt;&gt; Doing inner HTML.

110
00:04:50.972 --> 00:04:52.760
&gt;&gt; Inner HTML, boom.

111
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.587
Did you know, HTMX,
you can say how you want to replace it.

112
00:04:56.587 --> 00:05:03.920
So let's just jump up here and
let's do a little hx-swap="outerHTML".

113
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.359
So instead of replacing
the inner contents,

114
00:05:06.359 --> 00:05:09.256
let's replace the entire element here for
a second.

115
00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:11.269
So let's at least fix that problem.

116
00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.017
So I'm gonna do that, do that.

117
00:05:13.017 --> 00:05:17.254
And boom, as we added a bunch, notice
that we no longer have that problem.

118
00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:20.707
So we can kinda specify how we
wish to swap out the elements,

119
00:05:20.707 --> 00:05:22.790
which is a pretty cool little item.

120
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.236
So for those that didn't see it,
on the form, I did hx-swap.

121
00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:29.688
And so
this is just how you dynamically say,

122
00:05:29.688 --> 00:05:32.874
this is how we want to change things out.

123
00:05:32.874 --> 00:05:35.856
Pretty cool, pretty great,
very happy about that.

124
00:05:35.856 --> 00:05:37.727
I'm happy, you're happy, hopefully.

125
00:05:37.727 --> 00:05:39.830
Let's keep being happy together.

126
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.947
All right, so is that good?

127
00:05:43.947 --> 00:05:45.348
What's wrong with this approach again?

128
00:05:45.348 --> 00:05:46.311
There's two big things.

129
00:05:46.311 --> 00:05:48.666
There's two very glaring problems here.

130
00:05:48.666 --> 00:05:50.079
We already kinda discussed the first one.

131
00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:50.986
What's the first one?

132
00:05:50.986 --> 00:05:55.207
&gt;&gt; First one is returning multiple users.

133
00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:57.613
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're returning way too
many users, it could get really bad.

134
00:05:57.613 --> 00:06:01.046
What's the second obvious
problem with this approach?

135
00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:03.233
&gt;&gt; It doesn't clear out.

136
00:06:03.233 --> 00:06:06.234
&gt;&gt; I mean, I just added pretty much
the same contact over and over again.

137
00:06:06.234 --> 00:06:08.762
There is absolutely no
error handling at all.

138
00:06:08.762 --> 00:06:13.702
What happened if what we put up there and
you can always bypass the client, right?

139
00:06:13.702 --> 00:06:19.614
So you cannot even think that client
validation is a real topic to be trusted.

140
00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:21.200
You have to do all your
validation on the server.

141
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.086
So the two big problems is, a,
we're sending all the contacts, and b,

142
00:06:25.086 --> 00:06:28.813
we have no way to specify how errors
are delivered back to the client.

143
00:06:28.813 --> 00:06:32.772
Maybe this contact already exists,
maybe you didn't enter in a valid email.

144
00:06:32.772 --> 00:06:34.773
We got some problems here.

145
00:06:34.773 --> 00:06:36.612
So I already did this.

146
00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:39.032
Well, one option is we could use
something called response headers.

147
00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:41.790
If you don't know what
a response headers are, in HTMX,

148
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.649
you can actually do some server-side
overriding of how things should happen.

149
00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:50.024
So I can say, hey, we're gonna
retarget our response to the form and

150
00:06:50.024 --> 00:06:51.768
deliver down some errors.

151
00:06:51.768 --> 00:06:53.685
We could re-swap.

152
00:06:53.685 --> 00:06:58.400
We don't wanna outer HTML swap,
we want to inner HTML swap.

153
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.569
Or however we wish to do it, we could
do any sort of reswapping, retargeting,

154
00:07:02.569 --> 00:07:03.718
re-all the things.

155
00:07:03.718 --> 00:07:06.548
I don't wanna do that, but
that is an option if you wish to do that.

156
00:07:06.548 --> 00:07:10.088
I find that feels a little bit more
confusing for me, feels a little bit

157
00:07:10.088 --> 00:07:14.168
harder to kinda grasp what's happening,
feels like it could be a little goofy.

158
00:07:14.168 --> 00:07:16.822
Another option would be
out of band updates.

159
00:07:16.822 --> 00:07:21.080
So this is pretty cool idea where HTMX,
you can actually say, hey,

160
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.336
go update this other place as well.

161
00:07:23.336 --> 00:07:27.997
So okay, so let's make the response
be an error on duplicate email and

162
00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:32.976
displays errors in the form,
400 status code for bad request, right?

163
00:07:32.976 --> 00:07:36.201
Let's use proper status codes.

164
00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:38.452
Let's have this really proper experience.

165
00:07:38.452 --> 00:07:39.190
I just wanna make sure.

166
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.366
Okay, awesome, let's do that.

167
00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:44.600
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna go over here.

168
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.857
And luckily, we were very, very smart
earlier, we did a little type alias.

169
00:07:49.857 --> 00:07:54.807
So I'm gonna do a little func,
a little c *Contacts,

170
00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:58.909
and then we're gonna go hasEmail, why not?

171
00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:01.795
This is probably not the way
you'd wanna do it, but

172
00:08:01.795 --> 00:08:04.092
this works out pretty much, all right?

173
00:08:04.092 --> 00:08:07.398
Oopses, we don't need to do
a little star right there.

174
00:08:07.398 --> 00:08:10.808
You don't wanna have a pointer of
a pointer, it just seems really bad.

175
00:08:10.808 --> 00:08:13.685
Invalid receiver,
can we grab one of those on here?

176
00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:14.516
Can we not do that?

177
00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:16.326
I thought we could do that on this one.

178
00:08:16.326 --> 00:08:18.063
Am I crazy you can't do that?

179
00:08:18.063 --> 00:08:18.979
I swear you could.

180
00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:21.776
This is just such disappoint,
such disappoint.

181
00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:23.982
Okay, we can't do that.

182
00:08:23.982 --> 00:08:25.631
I might be rusting inside my head.

183
00:08:25.631 --> 00:08:30.441
All right, fine, we'll do it on the data,

184
00:08:30.441 --> 00:08:33.698
whatever, [SOUND] whatever.

185
00:08:33.698 --> 00:08:35.505
Sometimes I put in too
many things in my head.

186
00:08:35.505 --> 00:08:36.424
All right, there we go.

187
00:08:36.424 --> 00:08:38.890
So we went over,
we're gonna do hasEmail on the data.

188
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.447
It's gonna go over all of its contacts,

189
00:08:41.447 --> 00:08:45.597
see if it can find a contact that's
emails true, and there we go.

190
00:08:45.597 --> 00:08:47.491
Now, awesome.

191
00:08:49.417 --> 00:08:50.096
Let's go.

192
00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:52.282
So we're happy about that.

193
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.502
So we're gonna go down here and
I'm going like this.

194
00:08:54.502 --> 00:08:58.398
If data.hasEmail,
I want to render something back.

195
00:08:58.398 --> 00:09:01.786
I want to render some sort of error,
I wanna say, hey, you're a 400, hey,

196
00:09:01.786 --> 00:09:02.863
things have gone wrong.

197
00:09:02.863 --> 00:09:04.373
So I'm gonna replace this with the 400.

198
00:09:04.373 --> 00:09:05.691
We're gonna render a 400.

199
00:09:05.691 --> 00:09:09.123
And now, we need to display
some sort of error here.

200
00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:12.574
So we have that thing called form.

201
00:09:12.574 --> 00:09:15.553
You may remember our well-named
form right here, but

202
00:09:15.553 --> 00:09:18.932
we're gonna need to have some
more information stored here.

203
00:09:18.932 --> 00:09:23.258
I want to be able to return down
a form that has its previous values,

204
00:09:23.258 --> 00:09:28.153
and I also wanna be able to return down
a form that has some errors within it.

205
00:09:28.153 --> 00:09:30.360
And so let's jump back here and
let's do that.

206
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:35.090
So I'm gonna create something called
type FormData, which is a struct,

207
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:39.149
which has a values,
which is gonna be a map[string]string.

208
00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:41.528
And we'll have Errors map[string]string.

209
00:09:41.528 --> 00:09:43.815
Just keep it simple for
now, pretty generic.

210
00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:46.321
Maybe not the way you want to do that,
that's fine.

211
00:09:46.321 --> 00:09:48.081
And then I'm gonna have a newFormData.

212
00:09:48.081 --> 00:09:49.291
Hey, thank you very much.

213
00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:52.238
Which is just simply gonna say,
hey, we're gonna make those things.

214
00:09:52.238 --> 00:09:55.102
Cuz if you don't make a map,
you may not realize this.

215
00:09:55.102 --> 00:09:58.609
It's one of Go langs many downfalls,
is that if you don't make a map,

216
00:09:58.609 --> 00:10:00.815
it's a nil pointer, and things go kaboom.

217
00:10:00.815 --> 00:10:02.901
It's just so annoying.

218
00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:06.645
Just give me a zero value map,
that's all I want in my life.

219
00:10:06.645 --> 00:10:09.922
I know gophers are gonna come out and
be like, well, actually,

220
00:10:09.922 --> 00:10:11.391
did you know the reason why?

221
00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:14.988
I don't wanna hear your reason why,
it makes me angry, okay?

222
00:10:14.988 --> 00:10:17.508
All right, now that I got done with that,

223
00:10:17.508 --> 00:10:22.160
fairly useless- [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Okay-

224
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:22.840
&gt;&gt; Shake my finger.

225
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.732
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I shake my finger
at the silly things, right?

226
00:10:24.732 --> 00:10:27.829
All right, so now that we got that,
well, actually.

227
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:29.762
All right, so now that we did that,

228
00:10:29.762 --> 00:10:32.544
let's think about how we
want to do this form data.

229
00:10:32.544 --> 00:10:36.897
Well, we don't care if this looks pretty,
so I'm just simply gonna go like this.

230
00:10:36.897 --> 00:10:43.289
if .Values.name, yeah,
we'll keep it lowercase, why?

231
00:10:43.289 --> 00:10:44.472
It is what it is.

232
00:10:44.472 --> 00:10:47.714
value="{{ .Values.name }}", easy, awesome.

233
00:10:47.714 --> 00:10:52.005
We'll do the exact same thing right here,
and we'll replace name with email,

234
00:10:52.005 --> 00:10:52.655
all right?

235
00:10:52.655 --> 00:10:56.927
So if we have an email,
put the email in the value, all right?

236
00:10:56.927 --> 00:11:00.622
Pretty easy, I know a lot of people
are like, well, what about placeholder?

237
00:11:00.622 --> 00:11:03.417
Again, we're not trying to focus
on the beauty aspect here,

238
00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:06.015
we're just trying to focus on
the practical use of HTMX.

239
00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:12.231
So now we need to do something really
important, which is if .Errors.email,

240
00:11:12.231 --> 00:11:17.076
well, then we need to display
this wonderful error message.

241
00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.592
So yeah, look at that,
I'm gonna erase this.

242
00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:21.460
We even got ourselves a red error.

243
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.257
So we're gonna have an email error that
says, hey, there was an error here.

244
00:11:25.257 --> 00:11:27.896
We're gonna display this as the form,
it's now part of our form.

245
00:11:27.896 --> 00:11:29.565
Forms, by the way, are awful.

246
00:11:29.565 --> 00:11:30.606
They always turn into this.

247
00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:33.807
They're always just a huge nightmare
of just previous values and

248
00:11:33.807 --> 00:11:35.677
filling things in and doing all that.

249
00:11:35.677 --> 00:11:40.418
So fun times,
I've never met a form I liked.

250
00:11:40.418 --> 00:11:42.765
So now that we have
form looking like this,

251
00:11:42.765 --> 00:11:45.970
we're probably gonna need to
make several changes here.

252
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.084
All right, so be prepared.

253
00:11:48.084 --> 00:11:49.572
So let's jump back to our server.

254
00:11:49.572 --> 00:11:51.339
Let's first deal with
this part right here.

255
00:11:51.339 --> 00:11:55.859
Word like this, formData := newFormData().

256
00:11:55.859 --> 00:11:58.664
Beautiful, I'm gonna go formData,
Values is name.

257
00:11:58.664 --> 00:12:01.574
I'm gonna do formData, value is email.

258
00:12:01.574 --> 00:12:03.138
And then I need to do formData.Email.

259
00:12:03.138 --> 00:12:04.779
Look at that.
Copilot, look at that,

260
00:12:04.779 --> 00:12:06.497
it's like you knew what I was doing.

261
00:12:06.497 --> 00:12:09.773
We're gonna add in the error,
emails already exist.

262
00:12:09.773 --> 00:12:13.843
Easy peasy, pumpkin seedsy,
pass in the formData.

263
00:12:13.843 --> 00:12:16.456
But now that we've done that,
we've also screwed up our index page.

264
00:12:16.456 --> 00:12:18.851
You can no longer refresh cuz everything
is gonna have all these errors.

265
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:20.319
These properties don't exist.

266
00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:24.570
So let's create a quick little
index page right here, type,

267
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:27.613
I'll just call it Page, why not, struct.

268
00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:31.078
And it's gonna have Data, which is
the Data, and we're gonna have Form,

269
00:12:31.078 --> 00:12:32.189
which is the formData.

270
00:12:32.189 --> 00:12:34.937
Easy peasy,
look at how beautiful this programming is.

271
00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:37.079
It's really not beautiful,
no one should be impressed by this.

272
00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:40.306
By the way, everyone should
be fairly upset about this.

273
00:12:40.306 --> 00:12:44.163
Instead, so now we're just gonna
do a nice little newPage, just so

274
00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:45.936
I don't have to do any of that.

275
00:12:45.936 --> 00:12:47.209
Can I just do this?

276
00:12:47.209 --> 00:12:50.398
Yeah, newData, there we go.

277
00:12:50.398 --> 00:12:51.461
And then just hit him with one of those.

278
00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:54.373
Look at this, just the world's
greatest programming going on here.

279
00:12:54.373 --> 00:12:57.714
So instead of using a data,
let's use a page, and go newPage.

280
00:12:57.714 --> 00:12:59.407
There we go.
We have our empty page,

281
00:12:59.407 --> 00:13:01.105
it's absolutely fantastic.

282
00:13:01.105 --> 00:13:05.388
We're gonna use page in our index,
we're gonna have to use page all

283
00:13:05.388 --> 00:13:10.069
the way down here, page.Data, and
things, Data with a capital D.

284
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.929
There we go.

285
00:13:10.929 --> 00:13:16.315
We're gonna have to do the whole
page.Data with a capital D.

286
00:13:16.315 --> 00:13:19.345
Yeah, there we go,
page.Data with capital D.

287
00:13:19.345 --> 00:13:23.039
We're gonna display with the page,
fantastic.

288
00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:26.184
All right, I think everything
is looking nice right now.

289
00:13:26.184 --> 00:13:26.751
All right, so there we go.

290
00:13:26.751 --> 00:13:28.284
So we have the form, we have all that.

291
00:13:28.284 --> 00:13:32.586
Let's upgrade our templates as well
because our index template currently

292
00:13:32.586 --> 00:13:35.528
doesn't actually pass
the correct stuff around.

293
00:13:35.528 --> 00:13:37.598
So we'll just jump in here.

294
00:13:37.598 --> 00:13:41.699
And instead of passing the form, I'm
gonna just do .Form, and for the display,

295
00:13:41.699 --> 00:13:43.072
I'm just gonna do .Data.

296
00:13:43.072 --> 00:13:45.953
All right, kinda got those things through,
things are nice.

297
00:13:45.953 --> 00:13:48.360
So now that means our
form object here is that.

298
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.638
All right, so that's pretty much
everything that we're gonna need to do.

299
00:13:51.638 --> 00:13:53.644
We still kinda have some
question marks around here.

300
00:13:53.644 --> 00:13:55.937
TODO, question mark,
what do we do down here?

301
00:13:55.937 --> 00:14:00.711
Well, let's first make sure we can
trigger this and see that thing work.

302
00:14:00.711 --> 00:14:02.759
And if everything's gone good,
look at that, we have that.

303
00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:04.647
If everything's gone good, we can refresh.

304
00:14:04.647 --> 00:14:06.135
Okay, we got some good stuff here.

305
00:14:06.135 --> 00:14:08.901
I'm gonna click this email, I should
have made the email so much easier.

306
00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:11.156
You know what?
In fact, I'm gonna jump back here,

307
00:14:11.156 --> 00:14:12.463
I'm gonna go back to gd.

308
00:14:12.463 --> 00:14:16.131
Gosh dang, it's not even gd.

309
00:14:16.131 --> 00:14:16.698
Let's go like that.

310
00:14:16.698 --> 00:14:19.519
I'm gonna make it aoeu cuz I use Dvorak,
by the way.

311
00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:22.767
By the way, I use Dvorak, and
that's just my home row on this finger,

312
00:14:22.767 --> 00:14:24.049
makes it super easy to use.

313
00:14:24.049 --> 00:14:26.499
So now that we have that there,
I can just refresh that.

314
00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:27.220
Look at that.

315
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.479
So now I should be giving
a duplicate email, right?

316
00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:35.588
So when I create this,
it should actually display a problem.

317
00:14:35.588 --> 00:14:37.093
What happened?

318
00:14:37.093 --> 00:14:41.477
Was check the network tab just
to make sure we got the 400s.

319
00:14:41.477 --> 00:14:48.215
The 400s has this,
what the heck's going on?

320
00:14:48.215 --> 00:14:48.885
Well, several things.

321
00:14:48.885 --> 00:14:51.001
We didn't do several things correct, okay?

322
00:14:51.001 --> 00:14:52.778
First off, look at our targeting.

323
00:14:52.778 --> 00:14:54.552
Our targeting totally sucks, okay?

324
00:14:54.552 --> 00:14:56.078
We're not targeting the right stuff here.

325
00:14:56.078 --> 00:14:59.642
So let's just jump back and
make sure we're targeting the right stuff.

326
00:14:59.642 --> 00:15:02.406
We're gonna just take out the target.

327
00:15:02.406 --> 00:15:05.561
When you submit a form,
its default target is itself.

328
00:15:05.561 --> 00:15:07.173
Okay, problem number one solved.

329
00:15:07.173 --> 00:15:09.909
Does that solve our problem?

330
00:15:09.909 --> 00:15:12.033
Well, of course not,
it does not solve our problem.

331
00:15:12.033 --> 00:15:15.376
We have one other thing that's wrong,
we responded with a 400.

332
00:15:15.376 --> 00:15:21.078
By default,
HTMX is not going to display 400, right?

333
00:15:21.078 --> 00:15:22.383
Because that would be really bad.

334
00:15:22.383 --> 00:15:23.947
You don't know what's coming
down with your server.

335
00:15:23.947 --> 00:15:26.657
Second off,
is 400 even the right status code?

336
00:15:26.657 --> 00:15:29.395
Technically, you should probably
use something like 422.

337
00:15:29.395 --> 00:15:31.769
A 400 means that you've
made a bad request.

338
00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:33.844
Did we make a bad request?

339
00:15:33.844 --> 00:15:36.760
No, semantically,
we made a very correct request.

340
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.488
Here you go.

341
00:15:37.488 --> 00:15:40.946
We actually did a 422,
the entity itself was unprocessable.

342
00:15:40.946 --> 00:15:42.386
So let's first do that.

343
00:15:42.386 --> 00:15:45.194
Let's change it to a 422 to
be more semantically correct,

344
00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:48.002
even though now we're kinda
getting into the pedantics, and

345
00:15:48.002 --> 00:15:50.162
some people are like, I don't like that.

346
00:15:50.162 --> 00:15:54.985
I do like this for this specific reason
cuz it really allows HTMX to be the driver

347
00:15:54.985 --> 00:15:58.878
of your application state by
having very proper status codes.

348
00:15:58.878 --> 00:16:01.911
Cuz the second thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna update and

349
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:03.726
add this little script to our index.

350
00:16:03.726 --> 00:16:07.196
This little script,
when we load the content,

351
00:16:07.196 --> 00:16:11.555
will add a body or
an event listener to the body before swap.

352
00:16:11.555 --> 00:16:15.244
HTMX emits this event before
it swaps out the content.

353
00:16:15.244 --> 00:16:19.900
And what we're gonna do is say, hey,
if this is a 422, we know this is good.

354
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.775
So therefore, we should swap,
and this is not an error.

355
00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:28.122
And so we're gonna tell HTMX on 422s we
want to actually display what's going to

356
00:16:28.122 --> 00:16:30.370
happen because this is something we want.

357
00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:35.358
And so this is another reason why using
very precise, what's called status codes,

358
00:16:35.358 --> 00:16:39.589
allows you to actually have really
precise behavior where you want it.

359
00:16:39.589 --> 00:16:40.483
And so this is kinda cool.

360
00:16:40.483 --> 00:16:42.809
This is kinda like a little cool,
little thing right here.

361
00:16:42.809 --> 00:16:43.747
So I'm gonna jump over.

362
00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:45.331
Maybe some people don't think it's cool.

363
00:16:45.331 --> 00:16:46.286
I think it's cool.

364
00:16:46.286 --> 00:16:50.015
So I'm gonna go down here right into my
HTML, not even have it formatted well.

365
00:16:50.015 --> 00:16:51.645
We're just gonna put it in there.

366
00:16:51.645 --> 00:16:55.493
And now, when we refresh, we should be
able to see this beautiful, beautiful,

367
00:16:55.493 --> 00:16:56.745
beautiful thing happen.

368
00:16:56.745 --> 00:16:59.024
So I'm gonna go aoeu, aoeu.

369
00:16:59.024 --> 00:17:02.971
I'm gonna try to create contact, and it's
gonna say, hey, contact already exists.

370
00:17:02.971 --> 00:17:05.697
We could add it, so
I could throw in an autofocus here or

371
00:17:05.697 --> 00:17:08.858
a select here on the email to
kinda make this thing happen well.

372
00:17:08.858 --> 00:17:12.810
We could do all the designing of
the behavior you want your HTML to do in

373
00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:13.637
the backend.

374
00:17:13.637 --> 00:17:16.085
Or you could really add it to
the frontend if you were really,

375
00:17:16.085 --> 00:17:18.630
really excited about doing more
JavaScript in your frontend.

376
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.480
But at this point, we had a 422 response,

377
00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.083
and we are correctly identifying
where to update stuff.

378
00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:26.899
Kinda cool, right?

379
00:17:26.899 --> 00:17:28.507
It's kind of exciting.

380
00:17:28.507 --> 00:17:29.855
I'm kind of excited.

381
00:17:29.855 --> 00:17:30.427
I like it.

382
00:17:30.427 --> 00:17:34.067
I don't know, I think this is kinda fun
cuz we're starting to break down problems

383
00:17:34.067 --> 00:17:35.143
in engineering paths.

384
00:17:35.143 --> 00:17:38.244
There's design patterns that
are starting just to emerge,

385
00:17:38.244 --> 00:17:40.977
where you can handle forms
in a very generalized way,

386
00:17:40.977 --> 00:17:45.253
at least in response to errors, and then
how we're gonna drive in changes, okay.

387
00:17:45.253 --> 00:17:48.939
I don't know, I kinda find this
very exciting cuz I love the idea

388
00:17:48.939 --> 00:17:53.117
of being able to think of things in
patterns, not how do you want to do it?

389
00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:56.502
How did the person design
error handling in their form?

390
00:17:56.502 --> 00:17:58.538
Well, you look at any form,
it's all gonna be unique.

391
00:17:58.538 --> 00:18:00.517
It could be tons of different
libraries that it's using.

392
00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:03.000
It could require JSON to
some other library format.

393
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.614
You're just doing
a series of translations.

394
00:18:04.614 --> 00:18:09.585
Here, we're literally just going
from server state into HTML.

395
00:18:09.585 --> 00:18:11.411
It just feels good, feels simple.
