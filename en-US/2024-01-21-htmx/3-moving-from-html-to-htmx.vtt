00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.515
So we're unchanged from HTML which
is what we're doing right now and

2
00:00:03.515 --> 00:00:05.528
we're gonna change into HTMX, okay?

3
00:00:05.528 --> 00:00:07.440
So we're gonna do three things.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.900
We're gonna add an endpoint
POST / count that increments

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.187
the value that's gonna be
appearing on the index page.

6
00:00:16.187 --> 00:00:19.712
We're gonna remove the incrementing
from the GET / route and

7
00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:23.801
we're gonna add a button to the html
that goes and makes things happen.

8
00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:26.273
All right, sounds good?

9
00:00:26.273 --> 00:00:29.128
By the way, this will be a great
point if you use Copilot,

10
00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:33.251
you can kinda cheat some of the things
right here but if you don't, that's fine.

11
00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:37.961
So first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna add a POST endpoint should be

12
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:39.841
pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:43.471
So I'm gonna do that, POST count and
this will do the counting and

14
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:45.521
then I'll return out the template.

15
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:51.113
The get, we no longer increment on a get,
only on a post to count so

16
00:00:51.113 --> 00:00:56.025
pretty simple server change
not a lot just went on there.

17
00:00:56.025 --> 00:00:58.464
And then we're gonna go
over to our templates and

18
00:00:58.464 --> 00:01:00.200
we need to add a little something.

19
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.196
So, I am gonna add a button and that's
gonna do something called hx-post so

20
00:01:07.196 --> 00:01:12.771
this means I'm gonna make a post
request with this button and

21
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:16.734
it's gonna be for / count and there we go.

22
00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:22.651
[SOUND] So now we have a button
on the page called count.

23
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:25.754
I have told it to post to count.

24
00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:29.079
Don't worry, we're gonna explain all this
in detail this is just kinda like the high

25
00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:29.969
level introduction.

26
00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:33.785
We're gonna post it to count and
we should see just what happens.

27
00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:37.223
So I pretty much did everything
that needs to happen except for

28
00:01:37.223 --> 00:01:39.084
we also need HTMX in our website.

29
00:01:39.084 --> 00:01:40.990
HTMX is a small JavaScript library.

30
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.083
So I'll go like this I'm gonna tell
Copilot please get me htmx cdn.

31
00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:49.821
This is one of the fun parts
about Copilot and bam, it works.

32
00:01:49.821 --> 00:01:54.257
But if you don't have Copilot
go to htmx.org, go to the docs,

33
00:01:54.257 --> 00:01:59.216
search up the word script,
enter through a few times and right there.

34
00:01:59.216 --> 00:02:01.679
It's about the fourth
one in via the CDN link.

35
00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.019
We're just gonna use
the CDN link it's easy,

36
00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:07.149
it's straightforward to use we
don't need a build process.

37
00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.266
Awesome, we have that.

38
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:15.784
We now have the HTMX script and
we have the HTMX post going on.

39
00:02:15.784 --> 00:02:18.188
All right, so a lot of you are probably
confused again, that's okay.

40
00:02:18.188 --> 00:02:20.995
I want you to try to start drawing
boxes in your head at this point.

41
00:02:20.995 --> 00:02:23.866
So if we've done everything correctly,
when I refresh this,

42
00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:24.901
we get a count button.

43
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:26.145
You should also see that.

44
00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:31.793
Let's press count,
it's probably not what you wanted to see.

45
00:02:31.793 --> 00:02:36.892
This is probably not the results
you were hoping for.

46
00:02:36.892 --> 00:02:42.901
It kinda sucks that's just not,
this is not good at all, is this?

47
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:45.321
&gt;&gt; I can't get my air to run,
&gt;&gt; can't get air to run?

48
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:48.341
If you can't get air to run,
you can literally you could,

49
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:52.354
this would be super annoying, but
you can you can just go run cmd/main.go.

50
00:02:52.354 --> 00:02:56.108
And that will run the server,
it's just that when you make a change,

51
00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:59.085
you're just gonna have to run it yourself,
which is,

52
00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:01.630
it's just annoying more
than anything else.

53
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.682
Air was just supposed
to be a convenience so

54
00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:05.735
you don't forget to refresh your server.

55
00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:09.762
And then you'll be debugging the lies
this thing and then you'll go,

56
00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:13.378
yeah I forgot to update it just
like the classic Wi Fi watching us

57
00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:15.852
is just such a good developer experience.

58
00:03:15.852 --> 00:03:20.045
I cannot tell you how many hours of my
life has been devoted to I forgot to

59
00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:21.335
restart the server.

60
00:03:21.335 --> 00:03:25.871
At least I would honestly say at least
one solid year of my life has been

61
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.231
devoted to that just singular bug.

62
00:03:28.231 --> 00:03:33.347
All right, fantastic so
hopefully everyone is on board.

63
00:03:33.347 --> 00:03:34.864
So we did these code updates.

64
00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:38.486
Yep, everyone should be able to see
these updates pretty straightforward.

65
00:03:38.486 --> 00:03:41.627
I did more count right there and
now what happened?

66
00:03:41.627 --> 00:03:43.720
I don't think anyone likes the results.

67
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.214
I think it's probably time that I
introduce HTMX in maybe a more structured

68
00:03:48.214 --> 00:03:52.013
way because this probably isn't
what everyone was going for.

69
00:03:52.013 --> 00:03:57.243
This double button, somehow my button had
a baby here and everything feels confused
