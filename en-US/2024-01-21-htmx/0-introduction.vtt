00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.329
This is unironically the intro that I
have chosen, which is this beautiful

2
00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:10.399
post by htmx or actually just the banner,
which he tends to take pictures of

3
00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:15.320
things people positively say on Reddit,
and then make them his banner.

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.889
So this one says, the creator of htmx is
a blowhard who found fertile ground for

5
00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:21.756
his broken library in the minds
of back-end devs that refuse to

6
00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:25.089
learn JavaScript for
reasons that are 20 years out of date.

7
00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.229
It's propaganda being spread by
propagandists, ignore them all, and

8
00:00:28.229 --> 00:00:29.059
they'll go away.

9
00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:36.655
I am a propagandist being paid by big
HTML money, very excited about this.

10
00:00:36.655 --> 00:00:42.333
I don't know what it is about the world
of HTMX, but for whatever reason,

11
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:46.834
it has just the bizarrest,
either lovers or haters of it.

12
00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:50.114
There is just zero middle ground for
this library.

13
00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:54.729
I recently saw a tweet saying someone says
that they're very convinced that there's

14
00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.884
influence or money behind HTMX.

15
00:00:56.884 --> 00:01:00.129
I don't know what that means yet, I would
love to know more about this influencer.

16
00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.393
But if anyone would like to send me some,
please Twitch,

17
00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:06.263
Prime are always accepted around here.

18
00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:08.660
All right, so there you go,
this beautiful thing and,

19
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.003
yes, this was literally my introduction.

20
00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:14.413
You're welcome, but hypermedia
has been around for a long time.

21
00:01:14.413 --> 00:01:19.194
There's been papers, engineering exercises
long before the Internet had such a wide

22
00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:24.104
pipe that, I mean, even in 1995, there was
discussions in white papers about how to

23
00:01:24.104 --> 00:01:26.951
use this as an engine
of application state.

24
00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:30.701
So this is a fairly older and
more researched topic.

25
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:33.825
It's not just some new library
that recently came out,

26
00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:36.561
it's been going on now for
dang near 30 years.

27
00:01:36.561 --> 00:01:39.191
So hopefully,
everyone's kind of excited about that.

28
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:42.510
All right, so
there is more to HTMX than just the memes.

29
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.021
Yes, they use their Twitter quite a bit
to deliver all the sweet memes, but

30
00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:50.361
really it's just so people can learn about
HTMX, it's a great marketing strategy.

31
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:53.106
You would think that it's a whole
team of people doing something,

32
00:01:53.106 --> 00:01:55.871
spreading the word since it's
going all over the place.

33
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:59.224
And yes, it's now on Frontend Masters,
but, no,

34
00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:04.576
it's just one slightly unhinged man in
Montana tweeting from his professorship.

35
00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:08.364
Nobody knows what's happening, and
it's actually is used in production.

36
00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:12.075
There is a nice, beautiful talk about
somebody how they went from React to HTMX

37
00:02:12.075 --> 00:02:15.562
reduced a huge number of their libraries,
how fast they're able to build

38
00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:18.064
the project,
there's a list of sites that use it.

39
00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:21.962
I have people that have reached out to me
that have converted their big projects

40
00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:25.386
from SPAs into HTMX, several of them
with lots of lots of engineers,

41
00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:29.608
and they found that they are now moving
faster, it's easier to reason about.

42
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:32.203
And I do think that there's not like
every single application should be

43
00:02:32.203 --> 00:02:32.858
written in HTMX.

44
00:02:32.858 --> 00:02:36.671
And I think there's actually a good deal
of applications that probably are easier

45
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:40.670
or harder with client-side state
management, I just really don't know.

46
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.771
But I do think that there is
a sweet spot for HTMX, and so

47
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:45.695
at the end of this course I will try to
give you what I think is the goods place,

48
00:02:45.695 --> 00:02:48.610
what's the bad place, and
hopefully, you can do that too.

49
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.850
So why do I like HTMX?

50
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.124
Well, it's kind of a long story,
but in about, what, 2009,

51
00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:59.484
that movie, the social media one,
what's it called?

52
00:02:59.484 --> 00:03:01.047
Does anyone remember what it's called?

53
00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:02.062
&gt;&gt; The Social Awkward.

54
00:03:02.062 --> 00:03:04.691
&gt;&gt; The Social Awkward, yeah,
that's what it's called.

55
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.864
Where Mark Zuckerberg discovers Facebook,
and

56
00:03:06.864 --> 00:03:09.885
that he discovers people really
like to know who's dating who, and

57
00:03:09.885 --> 00:03:13.911
that's like the point of the story, and
it blows up and all these things happen.

58
00:03:13.911 --> 00:03:16.982
And I remember watching that show and
getting so

59
00:03:16.982 --> 00:03:20.113
pumped up to create my own website and
all that.

60
00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:23.341
Even though, I was in college and
all that, I was like gee, dang it,

61
00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:24.413
we're gonna do this.

62
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:28.494
And so that's what I did, I sat down and
for 80 hours a week, I tried to learn how

63
00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:33.023
to make websites for, gosh,
four years straight, something like that.

64
00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:37.136
And it was fantastic, I made websites,
tried to do all these things, lost all my

65
00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:41.251
money, lived in a small studio apartment
where the man below me smoked meth, and

66
00:03:41.251 --> 00:03:45.739
threatened to kill me, and my beautiful
wife, so we eventually moved out of there.

67
00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:46.741
Fantastic times, but

68
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:49.809
that was the introduction into
the web programming world that I had.

69
00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:53.599
And through that, I got to see
a whole bunch of change, right?

70
00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.072
I started before jQuery was super popular,
and then during the height of jQuery,

71
00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:03.195
where you'd even do your math via jQuery,
you know that whole

72
00:04:03.195 --> 00:04:08.436
jQuery dollar sign three dot add for,
it was really really beautiful.

73
00:04:08.436 --> 00:04:10.964
Those are the good days, and
so that was the height of it,

74
00:04:10.964 --> 00:04:13.020
you can see all
the Stack Overflow questions,

75
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.572
that every last one was answered with
jQuery no matter what it was, fantastic.

76
00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:20.345
And then React came out, and
at that point I was working at Netflix.

77
00:04:20.345 --> 00:04:23.215
By the way I work at Netflix and
during that time,

78
00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:27.765
I remember thinking this is the coolest
thing ever, because I've been using

79
00:04:27.765 --> 00:04:31.349
jQuery, and all this stuff to
manage my website for so long.

80
00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.212
And now, there's like something that
feels better, it feels more exciting, and

81
00:04:36.212 --> 00:04:38.745
I couldn't believe how cool it was.

82
00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:42.365
And so we started doing that, and
even at Netflix, we started adopting it,

83
00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.432
even for television platform,
and it took us a long time.

84
00:04:45.432 --> 00:04:46.620
And during that process,

85
00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.272
it went from classes are the best
to classes are the worst.

86
00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:52.566
We had functional component use effect,
don't use effect, and just kept on

87
00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:55.520
changing, and kept on happening
over the course of the eight years.

88
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.077
And in there, I tried to solve a lot of
the data fetching problems that people run

89
00:04:59.077 --> 00:04:59.857
into with SPAs.

90
00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:01.796
And they're rerunning into and

91
00:05:01.796 --> 00:05:06.509
rediscovering the glories of the N+1
query problem in RSCs right now.

92
00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.002
And so it's just like you watch
all these things happen, and

93
00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:13.809
you realize that maybe something
went wrong along the way.

94
00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.359
Maybe things weren't exactly
what I thought they were.

95
00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:19.503
And I started becoming disenfranchised
about six years ago, and

96
00:05:19.503 --> 00:05:21.228
I just became progressively more.

97
00:05:21.228 --> 00:05:25.974
And I've just been looking around trying
to find something that is maybe less

98
00:05:25.974 --> 00:05:30.075
foot gunning, something that less
causes so many easy problems.

99
00:05:30.075 --> 00:05:33.162
And, yeah, there will always be
the website that needs these high powered

100
00:05:33.162 --> 00:05:35.122
engines, but for
the most part, for all of us,

101
00:05:35.122 --> 00:05:38.118
they're just making our nice little
reel of cat photos on the Internet.

102
00:05:38.118 --> 00:05:42.319
You just don't need necessarily
the largest possible state.

103
00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:46.480
I think of the, I don't know if you
guys watched the One Piece live action,

104
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.236
but when the greatest swordsman fight ever
happens, and he pulls out the little teeny

105
00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:55.025
tiny sword, the answer was you just
don't hunt fish with a cannon.

106
00:05:55.025 --> 00:05:57.868
And it's just like, yeah, sometimes you
just gotta get the little sword out,

107
00:05:57.868 --> 00:06:00.858
you don't have to have the big one, and
so I just absolutely love that part.

108
00:06:00.858 --> 00:06:04.136
And so that's kind of HTMX, that's kind of
why I love it is that it kind of fit this

109
00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:05.824
weird place that I've been looking for,

110
00:06:05.824 --> 00:06:09.057
which is I just need something that I can
reason about in a more engineering sense

111
00:06:09.057 --> 00:06:12.278
about how something moves over time,
cuz that's ultimately what I'd like.

112
00:06:13.558 --> 00:06:18.223
HTMX is extremely Googleable, if you
happen to know what you're looking for,

113
00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:21.369
if you know the terms,
it's extremely Googleable.

114
00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:24.224
I'll show you,
if I go like this, htmx select,

115
00:06:24.224 --> 00:06:28.069
it's gonna come up as one of the first
things of how you do a thing.

116
00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.337
So hx-select, it's gonna give you
all the notes for it, it's very,

117
00:06:32.337 --> 00:06:36.764
very easy to learn how to use this,
everything is extremely lookupable.

118
00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:39.435
And I helped build the LSP,
which is pretty nice,

119
00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:42.248
it really only works
with Neovim right now.

120
00:06:42.248 --> 00:06:46.320
I'm sure someone, I know it kind of has a
VS Code integration, it's not on Mason or

121
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.303
anything, but it's all kind of there,
it's pretty nice.

122
00:06:49.303 --> 00:06:53.038
There's a great book, the book is really
great, it's free digitally, so go use it.

123
00:06:53.038 --> 00:06:58.094
You can also get HTMX coffee mugs that
exclaim that you are a HTMX shill,

124
00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.838
very good with influencer money.

125
00:07:00.838 --> 00:07:02.378
So fantastic stuff out there.
