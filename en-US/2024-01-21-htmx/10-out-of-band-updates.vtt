WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.090
So we can render errors,
well, what about success?

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.314
So now we gotta start thinking
about out of band updates,

3
00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:10.230
because right now our
form replaces itself.

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.770
So let's go back here and let's think
about what we can do down here.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.430
Once we have our contacts here,
we want to render just the context.

6
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.159
I know we're gonna fix the problem of
too many contacts, but right now let's

7
00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:28.623
just think about the very narrow case
of form is good, update contacts.

8
00:00:28.623 --> 00:00:31.679
So instead of doing, let's see,
what are we doing right here?

9
00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.629
We do a display,
display is the right thing.

10
00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.219
I think this looks pretty good, except for
if we have a success, what's gonna happen?

11
00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.793
Let's find out what happens if we
have a success with our current one.

12
00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:44.173
I'm gonna put in a little bracket there,
Create Contact.

13
00:00:44.173 --> 00:00:45.419
And now what are we getting?

14
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.800
What are we getting,

15
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.086
why can't I see you?

16
00:00:58.086 --> 00:01:01.884
That was strange, Email already exists.

17
00:01:01.884 --> 00:01:03.464
Let's just make sure I have everything.

18
00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:07.669
Why am I over getting a 500,
what the heck's happening here?

19
00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:11.224
Let me just make sure,
can't evaluate field Contacts.

20
00:01:11.224 --> 00:01:13.258
Okay, we're actually having the classic,

21
00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:15.944
I didn't update the templates
as we talked about earlier.

22
00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:17.314
What are we gonna do right here?

23
00:01:17.314 --> 00:01:18.094
Let's do the right thing.

24
00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:22.728
So right now, I can just simply do,
not page, but page Data.

25
00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:24.928
Cuz remember we're
displaying the contacts.

26
00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:27.348
I know again, we probably should
have just called the contacts.

27
00:01:27.348 --> 00:01:28.548
We're cutting corners, people.

28
00:01:28.548 --> 00:01:30.488
We're cutting corners, people.

29
00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:33.548
Let's refresh that, and now we do that.

30
00:01:33.548 --> 00:01:36.918
And look at this, our form went away and
all of our contacts suck.

31
00:01:36.918 --> 00:01:40.938
Because why, why did our form go away and
why do we have two sets of contacts?

32
00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.287
&gt;&gt; Replaced itself.

33
00:01:42.287 --> 00:01:43.529
&gt;&gt; Yep, replaced itself.

34
00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.661
Perfect, all right.

35
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.491
So we need to do an out of band update.

36
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:49.621
So I'm gonna jump back
over here to my templates.

37
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.541
And I'm gonna go down here and
let's pull out a contact.

38
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.501
So block contact,
notice I named this one correctly.

39
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:00.124
I felt pretty adventurous today,
maybe a little enterprising.

40
00:02:00.124 --> 00:02:02.188
I just felt it was the right
move to do right here.

41
00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.663
So I have this nice little contact
that we're gonna put right here.

42
00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:10.285
And I'm gonna go template, what is it?

43
00:02:10.285 --> 00:02:11.755
contact, perfect.

44
00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:14.798
So that should all just work out
just to make sure, hit that refresh,

45
00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:15.801
we're looking good.

46
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.865
And now I'm gonna do what is referred
to as an out of band contact.

47
00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.556
I'm gonna call this, oob-contact.

48
00:02:21.556 --> 00:02:25.346
Inside of here, I'm gonna render
out a template that is contact.

49
00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:29.296
Right here, I need to add two things.

50
00:02:30.326 --> 00:02:34.740
I need to add to HTMX that I
want this thing to replace

51
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.456
some other item on the screen.

52
00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:42.544
So I'm gonna go like this,
hx-swap- out of band.

53
00:02:42.544 --> 00:02:45.861
So this attribute allows you to specify
that some content in the response should

54
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.384
be swapped into the DOM somewhere
else other than the target.

55
00:02:49.384 --> 00:02:53.123
So you can kind of imagine that we're
almost creating a real-time video game.

56
00:02:53.123 --> 00:02:55.977
Based on the user input,
we are now updating the display and

57
00:02:55.977 --> 00:02:58.731
we're kind of doing this game
of how we're doing stuff.

58
00:02:58.731 --> 00:03:01.730
So that's kind of how I
like to look at it, right?

59
00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.590
So we're gonna add in a selector,
I'm gonna say, contacts.

60
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.570
So swap me out to contacts, fantastic.

61
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.380
And then also notice that I am just
doing a singular contact here.

62
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.460
I'm not doing all the contacts.

63
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.192
So, let's think about how we can
do this in a more singular way.

64
00:03:21.192 --> 00:03:25.994
So instead of just doing
a swap out of bands

65
00:03:25.994 --> 00:03:30.397
right here, let's do a hx or hold on.

66
00:03:30.397 --> 00:03:31.205
Let's do, oops.

67
00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:31.990
Aah!

68
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.278
Let's do, afterbegin,

69
00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:42.602
afterbegin will prepend the content
before the first child inside the target.

70
00:03:42.602 --> 00:03:46.578
And then I'm gonna add an id
to it that's contacts.

71
00:03:46.578 --> 00:03:51.712
So now I've given it all the information,
I want you to target contacts and

72
00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:55.379
I want you to swap yourself
in at the front of the list,

73
00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.965
not destroy the list just swap
yourself into the front of the list.

74
00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:02.286
Pretty fun times, so
this is looking kind of neat.

75
00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:04.036
So this is called an out of band contact.

76
00:04:04.036 --> 00:04:09.922
So if I go here, I'm gonna do this,
contact = oopsies.

77
00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:15.054
Let's do one of those.

78
00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:17.176
We were gonna definitely
want that in there.

79
00:04:17.176 --> 00:04:20.280
And we're gonna want contact, there we go.

80
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.009
And I'm just gonna pass in, contact.

81
00:04:25.954 --> 00:04:29.189
And we're gonna do oob-contact.

82
00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.648
So now let's see what happens here.

83
00:04:30.648 --> 00:04:34.504
I'm gonna refresh this,
I'm gonna do an aoeu.

84
00:04:34.504 --> 00:04:36.368
All right, that already exists.

85
00:04:36.368 --> 00:04:38.497
So let's put a 1 inside there.

86
00:04:38.497 --> 00:04:42.497
Okay, well it did add it to
the front of the list, awesome,

87
00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:44.264
but where did our form go?

88
00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:48.749
Our form disappeared,
what the heck happened there?

89
00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:52.794
It's like I already knew, this is
a great question, who designed this?

90
00:04:52.794 --> 00:04:56.087
It's actually, okay, so does anyone
have a guess where the form went?

91
00:05:00.517 --> 00:05:01.988
Anybody?

92
00:05:01.988 --> 00:05:06.411
&gt;&gt; There's just no content, replace, it's
sending back nothing for the main content.

93
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:10.886
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] This man is ready right here,
you're ready for HTMX.

94
00:05:10.886 --> 00:05:14.898
Yes, so
we sent back nothing from the server.

95
00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:17.178
And we sent back an out of band update.

96
00:05:17.178 --> 00:05:20.508
So it said, okay, I see not a band update,
I'll take that out of band update.

97
00:05:20.508 --> 00:05:22.107
All right, what's the remaining content?

98
00:05:22.107 --> 00:05:23.508
Nothing, all right,

99
00:05:23.508 --> 00:05:27.795
well my form says replace outer with
the contents from the response.

100
00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:33.201
You spent nothing or you sent nothing we
replace something with nothing, fantastic.

101
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:38.787
So we can easily fix that by just
doing one extra render, c.Render.

102
00:05:38.787 --> 00:05:41.900
And we can do what is that, form.

103
00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.100
Now we need a new form data, there we go.

104
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.350
Just render it blank, we don't want
all the names and everything in there.

105
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.360
So absolutely fantastic,
we're not gonna do an error check.

106
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.950
It's warning me to do an error check.

107
00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.420
We're really good at this, I mean,
I could put in there, look at that.

108
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.120
I even have it on low macro just in case,
a little quick one.

109
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.430
If I just need to throw in an err,
or an err, an err, an err.

110
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.324
I can just do it really quickly, just
I'm so ready, so ready for go right now.

111
00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:10.807
So now that we've done that,
when I refresh it and I put in aoeu1 or

112
00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:12.261
plus sign, why not.

113
00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:16.648
It will add it to the front and
then give us a new form.

114
00:06:16.648 --> 00:06:19.659
So when we look at the response,
what do we get here?

115
00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:23.327
We get the following,
we get our main content and

116
00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:28.976
we get our out of bands updates somewhere
else within the web application.

117
00:06:28.976 --> 00:06:31.348
All right, all right,
all right it's kind of neat, right?

118
00:06:31.348 --> 00:06:34.438
Is it kind of neat, do we got some
thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideways?

119
00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:37.357
One in the chat,
if you're really excited about this.

120
00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:40.827
Yeah, we got a wall of ones,
we're feeling good.

121
00:06:40.827 --> 00:06:42.962
&gt;&gt; A lot of ones in
front of math chat too.

122
00:06:42.962 --> 00:06:46.005
&gt;&gt; Okay, I see a couple of not
ones not happy about that.

123
00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:50.513
But you can't win them all,
okay, you can't win them all.
