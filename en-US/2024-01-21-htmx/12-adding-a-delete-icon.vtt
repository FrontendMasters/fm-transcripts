00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.744
This is really where we're gonna try
to make it a touch more interactive,

2
00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:08.875
a touch more exciting,
maybe show that there are ways to add more

3
00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.104
client-side just stuff
than is there right now.

4
00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:15.110
So we're gonna talk about deleting and
events.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.130
So we need a good icon if
we're gona do deleting.

6
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.719
I did ask ChatGPT,
[SOUND] to give me an icon.

7
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:24.530
It produced this savage for
me and yes, I call these savages.

8
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.555
If I'm gonna call them pigs,
I gotta call them savages, okay,

9
00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:30.202
you can't just choose one and
not the other one, okay?

10
00:00:30.202 --> 00:00:32.204
And so here we go,
we're gonna copy the savage code,

11
00:00:32.204 --> 00:00:33.819
you're gonna definitely want this code.

12
00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.861
If you're gonna want that savage,
go ahead, take it,

13
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:38.822
it's beautiful, it is now yours.

14
00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:40.246
So what we're gonna do.

15
00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:42.920
Is we want to do some deleting, but

16
00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.440
I wanna highlight a really
cool part of HTMX.

17
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.511
You can use actual verbs,
not like fake verbs, okay?

18
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:54.066
We're not doing a post getting a 200 back
and getting a 400 error status underneath,

19
00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.860
we're actually using real
endpoints with real verbs.

20
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.161
That means you no longer have
to do this stupid thing.

21
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:04.008
How many people did that with all the fun
times back in the day where you'd have GET

22
00:01:04.008 --> 00:01:08.427
and POST, and then you'd always
have like a POST contact/delete/id,

23
00:01:08.427 --> 00:01:10.864
you like put the verb inside of the path.

24
00:01:10.864 --> 00:01:12.159
It's kind of annoying, it's kind of dumb.

25
00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.269
So with HTMX, we can just do the thing,
you just do it, so it's fantastic.

26
00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:21.015
Would you look at that that right there?

27
00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:25.443
We have contacts/id,
I'm very excited about that.

28
00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:26.632
So we're gonna update our html.

29
00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:29.449
Let's add a delete icon
next to an address.

30
00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:32.477
An address of course is a name and
an email address.

31
00:01:32.477 --> 00:01:35.384
And so we're gonna first include
the icon next to the address.

32
00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:39.246
We're gonna make a delete handler for
contacts/id, and then next we're gonna

33
00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:43.147
make an endpoint, we're gonna make
endpoint updates for this, okay?

34
00:01:43.147 --> 00:01:45.957
So should be pretty easy.

35
00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:46.978
Let's do this.

36
00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:48.237
All right,
&gt;&gt; Anyway,

37
00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:51.089
you could post the current
code to a branch?

38
00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:52.615
&gt;&gt; We could post the current
code to a branch.

39
00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:55.906
Yeah, let's do that,
let's just do that right now.

40
00:01:55.906 --> 00:01:58.304
Git status, I'm gonna do like this.

41
00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:01.554
Git add this, git commit batman.

42
00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:06.496
And we're gonna check out
the checkpoint -1, there we go.

43
00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:10.168
Git push origin checkpoint -1,
boom, there you go.

44
00:02:10.168 --> 00:02:13.003
So it's up there right now,
you can go get that code so

45
00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:15.978
you can start exactly in
a fresh location where I'm at.

46
00:02:15.978 --> 00:02:19.495
Because from here on out our programming
won't be nearly as extensive cuz that

47
00:02:19.495 --> 00:02:20.081
first part,

48
00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:23.722
anytime you start a project there's like
a lot of things you kind of got to do now.

49
00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:28.087
We're gonna get into the finer grain
detail, okay, we're gonna go deep in.

50
00:02:28.087 --> 00:02:29.565
So are you guys ready?

51
00:02:29.565 --> 00:02:32.751
Everyone ready?
Everyone has the delete icon.

52
00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.276
I don't think I have the delete icon
anymore, I'm not sure if I copied and

53
00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:35.857
pasted over it.

54
00:02:35.857 --> 00:02:38.315
So, there we go, just in case,
I have the delete icon.

55
00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:43.070
We're feeling good, looking good, I'll
put it one more time inside twitch chat.

56
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.165
And let's start.

57
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:46.571
All right, so
we're gonna jump over to our templates.

58
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:49.320
And I said we're gonna go all
the way down to our contact,

59
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.969
and now we need to put this
little delete icon in there.

60
00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.798
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go like this style=display flex,

61
00:02:55.798 --> 00:02:57.918
flax on those kids without tail wind.

62
00:02:57.918 --> 00:03:01.465
I am now not that one,
I'm now gonnna put in the savage.

63
00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:06.395
I'm gonna wrap it like every good thing
you do in HTML, you put divs around it.

64
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:06.993
What is that?

65
00:03:06.993 --> 00:03:08.951
I don't care, put a div on it.

66
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:13.736
And then I'm gonna go
style equals=width 1 rem.

67
00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:16.936
I forgot what rem stands for, but

68
00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:22.322
I think it's root font size cuz stands for
font size.

69
00:03:22.322 --> 00:03:24.120
Classic, really.

70
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.081
And so now, look at that, we got a little
trash can icons right next to that.

71
00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:29.732
How great is that?

72
00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:30.476
That's beautiful.

73
00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:34.030
Let's also add in a little pointer,
so when we put our pointer over it,

74
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.705
we get like a little finger on it.

75
00:03:35.705 --> 00:03:38.098
That always makes me feel good, right?

76
00:03:38.098 --> 00:03:41.939
Cursor, pointer, right, so
that should make it go.

77
00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:43.262
Yeah, look at that.

78
00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:47.333
You can't even see it, cuz, okay, it's not
the size of the cursor that really matters

79
00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:51.094
here, but it's really tiny, I can barely
even see it, but it is a pointer icon.
