WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.677
All right, absolutely beautiful.

2
00:00:01.677 --> 00:00:05.284
Again, we're not concerned about all
the other things that make HTML.

3
00:00:05.284 --> 00:00:10.000
So for those that are wondering about
accessibility, you can do accessibility.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.446
We're just not doing it right now, because
that requires like a degree in of itself.

5
00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:18.736
People go on conference
circuits to talk about it.

6
00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:20.256
It's a complicated topic.

7
00:00:20.256 --> 00:00:23.097
And I'm just not a good enough HTML
engineer to know all the things.

8
00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:25.769
All right, so now we have this
delicious icon right here.

9
00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.889
Next, we need to make it do
a delete to the icon's id.

10
00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:36.087
I mean, we need to make it
do a request to contacts id.

11
00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:38.602
Obviously you probably go,
we don't have ids for contacts.

12
00:00:38.602 --> 00:00:39.897
Well, we're gonna have to make one.

13
00:00:39.897 --> 00:00:44.005
Okay, we have to make one now, all right?

14
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.572
So, let's go hx-delete, this delete

15
00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:51.489
attribute call cause an element to
issue a delete request okay, fantastic.

16
00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.387
Let's absolutely do that and
let's go to contacts and

17
00:00:56.387 --> 00:00:59.587
then we'll do a slash id, yeah.

18
00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:00.946
Look at that.

19
00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:03.131
Looks good, right?

20
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:03.750
It's looking good.

21
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.810
This is feeling good.

22
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.708
And then I'm gonna also do a little
id up here and call this contact.

23
00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:11.836
And then we're gonna to
put an id on this one.

24
00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:15.775
This is for
a future problem that we will see.

25
00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:16.967
We'll get there, don't worry about it.

26
00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:18.506
So, okay, so we have this nice delete.

27
00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:22.768
So now how do we say what to delete?

28
00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:26.713
Because if I just issue this request and
we successfully delete,

29
00:01:26.713 --> 00:01:28.371
what is HTMX gonna remove?

30
00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.935
&gt;&gt; Should remove the HTML
connected to that contact.

31
00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:40.279
&gt;&gt; It will remove, currently,
the savage inside of this div, right?

32
00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:44.855
Because it always the default
behavior is swap inner HTML.

33
00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:48.561
So we need to have a different
swap potential strategy.

34
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:52.861
So let's first have hx-swap = outerHTML.

35
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:57.415
So now we will delete this div but
we're still only deleting the trash can.

36
00:01:57.415 --> 00:01:59.513
So we need to do something
a little bit different.

37
00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:06.011
Let's also add in hx target =, so normally
if you can use something called closest,

38
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:11.622
which is a CSS which does a selector
upwards and will check your ancestor.

39
00:02:11.622 --> 00:02:16.549
So technically, you could do something
like this, except for I am a div myself.

40
00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.897
Therefore closest we'll also consider
yourself as part of the selector thing.

41
00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:23.945
That's just welcome to web3
delicious standards here.

42
00:02:23.945 --> 00:02:25.950
Very annoying, I wish it just apparent and

43
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.291
beyond because that'd be super useful
because I could just say, hey,

44
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:32.152
delete my parent div and
it would just boom and it would work.

45
00:02:32.152 --> 00:02:33.782
So we can't do that, so
I'll just go like this.

46
00:02:33.782 --> 00:02:38.305
Contact, if you like how does
that little shift every time?

47
00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:39.990
I don't know what that is, there we go.

48
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.466
So fantastic.

49
00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:45.118
So now we're saying, hey,
who to delete, how to delete it,

50
00:02:45.118 --> 00:02:46.744
what endpoint to get go to.

51
00:02:46.744 --> 00:02:48.961
I think we're effectively ready.

52
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:51.789
Let's do a little refresh,
it says internal error.

53
00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:52.970
Why does it say an internal error?

54
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.552
Anybody?

55
00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:54.992
Anyone wanna make a guess?

56
00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:55.672
&gt;&gt; No ID.

57
00:02:55.672 --> 00:02:58.734
&gt;&gt; No ID,
this guy it's like you program go.

58
00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:01.430
It's just like, you know,
you know it you could feel it.

59
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.718
All right, so I'm gonna go up
to my little contact form and

60
00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:08.001
I'm just gonna go var id = 0.

61
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:08.752
Why not?

62
00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:11.694
This is why by the way,
if you're wondering why I did a little

63
00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:15.177
new contact here It's like I was pre
prepared for this is eventuality.

64
00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:16.175
We're having right here.

65
00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:18.527
So there we go.

66
00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:23.772
Okay, and there we go.

67
00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:25.723
Everything's been specified.

68
00:03:25.723 --> 00:03:27.428
We're looking good, fantastic.

69
00:03:27.428 --> 00:03:31.309
I don't think I technically need this one.

70
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:33.471
Yeah, I don't even need it.

71
00:03:33.471 --> 00:03:34.824
All right, so there we go.

72
00:03:34.824 --> 00:03:37.321
Awesome, so
now we have an Id on the contact forms,

73
00:03:37.321 --> 00:03:40.981
which means every single time we create
a contact, it will come with an Id,

74
00:03:40.981 --> 00:03:43.496
which is also why I use
these functions right here.

75
00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:46.623
So now even our dummy data,
we have Ids, we're feeling good,

76
00:03:46.623 --> 00:03:48.158
everything's looking good.

77
00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:50.505
We go back here, we hit refresh,
everything's there.

78
00:03:50.505 --> 00:03:55.350
Let's look at the HTML just to validate
that we have actually done the thing.

79
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.082
Let's bring it down,
bring it down, look at that.

80
00:03:58.082 --> 00:04:01.881
Look at that,
we have contact one reflects on the kids.

81
00:04:01.881 --> 00:04:05.713
This thing is saying, hey,
target contact one, swap out our HTML.

82
00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:09.375
So if I click it, let's bring up
the old network and I click that,

83
00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:10.718
look at what happened.

84
00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:13.418
It said, hey, that's not found.

85
00:04:13.418 --> 00:04:16.058
Why not?
Well, we did a 404 because there's nothing

86
00:04:16.058 --> 00:04:19.512
that we haven't added the handler yet,
but it did the right thing.

87
00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:24.199
It went to contact slash one and
issued a delete request.

88
00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.166
It's like proper, we're just so
proper at this point.

89
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:33.451
So let's do
an e.DELETE/contacts/id fantastic.

90
00:04:33.451 --> 00:04:41.531
Let's get the idStr equals that
I'll do id and err = strconvert.

91
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:44.214
I mean, maybe I could have done
something better here, but

92
00:04:44.214 --> 00:04:45.887
I didn't do something better here.

93
00:04:45.887 --> 00:04:52.855
Throw in one of those, if we hit that, I'm
just gonna return a e.string(400), right?

94
00:04:52.855 --> 00:04:55.334
Is that, no, it's c, sorry, c.string.

95
00:04:55.334 --> 00:04:59.809
So if you're not using our UI and
you're somehow by going around this I'm

96
00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:02.638
just gonna issue simple
responses outright.

97
00:05:02.638 --> 00:05:05.475
If you're using our UI you're not gonna
be running into these situations.

98
00:05:05.475 --> 00:05:09.015
Now you could say yes, you could run into
the situation you're running into it

99
00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:11.493
because it's been deleted
by two windows being open.

100
00:05:11.493 --> 00:05:15.668
Okay, I hear you we could plan for that we
could send back already deleted doesn't

101
00:05:15.668 --> 00:05:18.159
exist and
just have the content zip out anyways.

102
00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:22.582
Because we know that we've created
something, or something's on the screen

103
00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:27.071
that's out of sync with the server, which
is always the ultimate problem of all

104
00:05:27.071 --> 00:05:30.437
things involving the web,
just continuously out of sync.

105
00:05:30.437 --> 00:05:33.640
So we're gonna go all
the way back up to the data.

106
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.353
And let's add in one more function,
function d Data,

107
00:05:38.353 --> 00:05:44.308
let's go index of this and
we'll do let's see, what do we wanna do?

108
00:05:44.308 --> 00:05:46.241
We wanna do id, right?

109
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:47.928
So there we go.
So we're just gonna return out

110
00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:48.572
the contact.

111
00:05:48.572 --> 00:05:51.018
I mean, we could make it nice like that.

112
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.840
And copilot will pretty much do it for us.

113
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.220
All right, awesome.

114
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.616
And we don't wanna do that, actually.

115
00:05:55.616 --> 00:05:57.253
We wanna do an index out, don't we?

116
00:05:57.253 --> 00:05:59.551
Let's run return out the index
that was found here.

117
00:06:02.214 --> 00:06:04.940
-1, I guess we could do the other way.

118
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.640
I'm not sure why I did an index 1.

119
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.172
Why did I do an index 1?

120
00:06:08.172 --> 00:06:08.729
Did I do it?

121
00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:09.843
Do I have a good reason for it?

122
00:06:09.843 --> 00:06:12.187
I don't think I have a good reason for it.

123
00:06:12.187 --> 00:06:14.827
Index 1, it's just in my head,
that's what I was doing.

124
00:06:14.827 --> 00:06:17.429
So we're gonna keep on doing
the thing I already built.

125
00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:22.286
And we could actually do, yeah,
we could have just used the nil as that.

126
00:06:22.286 --> 00:06:24.027
Else, we need to simply delete out this.

127
00:06:24.027 --> 00:06:25.311
That's why I did that.

128
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:26.968
That's why I had to delete it out.

129
00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:29.095
That's the thing we got to do, I knew it.

130
00:06:29.095 --> 00:06:32.249
And so
let's just do the little deletion here.

131
00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.988
All right, fantastic.

132
00:06:32.988 --> 00:06:34.400
Let's just make sure this is good.

133
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.545
We're gonna have page up to index, and

134
00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:39.450
then we're gonna start
from index plus 1 and on.

135
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.233
Okay, awesome, we've now created
this wonderful contacts right here.

136
00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:45.632
We've updated our contacts.

137
00:06:45.632 --> 00:06:52.478
Now, we need to return something from this
deletion, which of course c.nocontent 200.

138
00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:54.539
Right, we're just gonna
return an empty reply.

139
00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.751
You got it.

140
00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:58.037
So I'm gonna refresh this.

141
00:06:58.037 --> 00:07:01.190
And when I hit Delete, it's gone.

142
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.998
Look at that.

143
00:07:01.998 --> 00:07:05.460
Inline deleting, refresh,
nothing is there.

144
00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.164
Hit the Save on the server, we're back.

145
00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:09.172
We just rehydrated the data.

146
00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:10.571
Okay, so inline deleting.

147
00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:11.478
We can inline delete, okay.

148
00:07:11.478 --> 00:07:12.571
This is positive.

149
00:07:12.571 --> 00:07:14.558
This is positive motions here.

150
00:07:14.558 --> 00:07:17.071
Hopefully everyone's excited about this,
fantastic.

151
00:07:17.071 --> 00:07:18.248
Look at all this code.

152
00:07:18.248 --> 00:07:20.679
We have really coded up a huge amount.
