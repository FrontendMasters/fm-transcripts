00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.010
Our index.html now requires
an object with contacts on it, and

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.092
we need to create an endpoint slash
context that is a post endpoint.

3
00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:09.587
So, let's do those couple things.

4
00:00:12.626 --> 00:00:13.635
So I'm gonna jump back here.

5
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.379
I'll just use this, and
we'll go contacts, awesome.

6
00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:22.529
And we render out the index here and
we have this down here.

7
00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.621
We'll just call this currently index for

8
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.496
now until we can figure out
what to do with this template.

9
00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:30.976
We'll create this here in just one moment,
but before we create it,

10
00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:33.684
let's start by creating the contacts item,
right?

11
00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:36.812
We need something that,
well, we need that.

12
00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.925
So let's first start off with type
Contact is gonna be a struct and

13
00:00:39.925 --> 00:00:44.075
it's gonna have a name that's a string and
it's gonna have an email that's a string.

14
00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:47.939
And then we want to be able to have a nice
little function that say newContact.

15
00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:49.568
I always like that kind of stuff,

16
00:00:49.568 --> 00:00:53.070
plus co pilot can really just make
this stuff kind of fly right through.

17
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.687
And do we want it as a pointer?

18
00:00:55.687 --> 00:00:59.583
No, let's just create a nice little
contact right here, very beautiful.

19
00:00:59.583 --> 00:01:05.499
And then I also want a type Contacts that
is going to equal a array of contact, this

20
00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:11.599
will make parts of things easier later on
having a nice little type item right here.

21
00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:15.863
And then we also need some sort of
type data that is a struct, right?

22
00:01:15.863 --> 00:01:17.873
This is just the data for the page.

23
00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:22.672
I don't care what you call it, Contacts
Contact, fantastic we're moving, okay?

24
00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:24.345
We're just trying to
move fast here people.

25
00:01:24.345 --> 00:01:29.367
I'm also gonna have a func newData that's
gonna return out a data object and

26
00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:34.089
I wanna make sure I fill it, I wanna
precede it with a little bit of data.

27
00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:37.802
Because if you don't, that means
every time we try to do something,

28
00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:42.156
you have to like type multiple times to
do all the stuff and it's super annoying,

29
00:01:42.156 --> 00:01:44.222
it's just, I don't want to do that.

30
00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:49.953
So we're gonna have jd@gmail.com and then
the next one since I'll call Clara Doe,

31
00:01:49.953 --> 00:01:53.693
because if you do Jane Doe
then the emails like the same,

32
00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:57.049
it's just super annoying,
so we can't do that.

33
00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.071
There we go.
So now we have our beautiful data that has

34
00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:03.744
a contact that has a couple
preceded contacts in there.

35
00:02:03.744 --> 00:02:06.807
Just to go over everything we did,
we created a new contact,

36
00:02:06.807 --> 00:02:08.075
which is name and email.

37
00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:10.912
We have a function to create
a new contact, name and email.

38
00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:15.511
You don't have to put this extra string
there, okay, okay, calm down and

39
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:17.343
let co-pilot take control.

40
00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:19.544
Okay, let co-pilot take the wheel.

41
00:02:19.544 --> 00:02:23.084
Next, have a little type alias for
contacts.

42
00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:26.054
We have a data that just
has contacts on there, and

43
00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:29.188
then we create a newData
with some preceded values.

44
00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:31.407
Okay, so hopefully everyone's
kind of following along.

45
00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:32.884
You should be able to
program this all on your own.

46
00:02:32.884 --> 00:02:37.247
Even if you're not familiar with Go, I bet
you could probably google /copilot your

47
00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:39.281
way into an answer here, not too hard.

48
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:40.704
All right, fantastic.

49
00:02:40.704 --> 00:02:42.794
So we don't need Count anymore,
I'm just gonna call it data.

50
00:02:42.794 --> 00:02:45.088
You know why?
Cuz I'm not good at naming things,

51
00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:47.176
I've never been good at naming things.

52
00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:49.070
I admit that,
I admit how bad I am at naming things.

53
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.271
So now we have a newData.

54
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:54.426
When we do our GET,
I'm just gonna pass in data cuz remember,

55
00:02:54.426 --> 00:02:56.681
we need something with the .Context on it.

56
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:59.874
Fantastic, now when we do post a contacts,
well,

57
00:02:59.874 --> 00:03:03.530
I don't really know what we
should be doing here, right?

58
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.034
Where should we be putting the data?

59
00:03:05.034 --> 00:03:06.152
What kind of data should we pass in?

60
00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:06.828
So for now,

61
00:03:06.828 --> 00:03:11.509
let's just render out the index because
we don't really have a strong plan here.

62
00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:14.277
And let's see what happens.

63
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.149
See, did I get everything correct?

64
00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.913
I just want to make sure.

65
00:03:19.913 --> 00:03:24.078
Yeah, look at how beautiful,
I used HTMX, rookie mistake right there.

66
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.797
Yeah, I forgot to actually
implement the post.

67
00:03:25.797 --> 00:03:28.317
Let's implement the post,
probably a good idea, right?

68
00:03:28.317 --> 00:03:32.470
So I want name from the form value,
I want email from the form value, and

69
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.249
then I'm just simply going to go
data.Contacts equals append data.Contacts,

70
00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.622
newContacts, name and email, right?

71
00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:44.364
Your classic Go code right here,
fantastic.

72
00:03:44.364 --> 00:03:45.399
And now we're just gonna render this out.

73
00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:49.292
So we've added the contact to the end
of the list and we're rendering it out.

74
00:03:49.292 --> 00:03:50.903
Sounds good?

75
00:03:50.903 --> 00:03:53.071
Awesome, did I get it all correct?

76
00:03:53.071 --> 00:03:57.089
All right, so before we display all this,
let's jump over here.

77
00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.779
I'm gonna refresh it.

78
00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.690
Look at how beautiful this is.

79
00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.240
We have ourselves this wonderful
modern looking form and so

80
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.871
now I'm just gonna type in a name and
email.

81
00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:09.451
Remember, we're putting no
validation on email right now and

82
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:12.094
look at what happens
when we create a contact.

83
00:04:12.094 --> 00:04:14.122
If everyone's followed
along mostly correct,

84
00:04:14.122 --> 00:04:16.352
you should be seeing something
that looks like this.

85
00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:24.004
So before I go on, do people need time?

86
00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:25.244
Time calls?

87
00:04:25.244 --> 00:04:26.594
Anybody?

88
00:04:26.594 --> 00:04:28.313
You look distraught, you need time?

89
00:04:28.313 --> 00:04:30.117
&gt;&gt; I'm fine.
&gt;&gt; You're fine?

90
00:04:30.117 --> 00:04:30.930
You good?

91
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.221
Yeah, no, yeah?

92
00:04:32.221 --> 00:04:32.797
Okay, yeah.

93
00:04:32.797 --> 00:04:33.837
Yeah, good?

94
00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:35.357
Yeah, okay.

95
00:04:35.357 --> 00:04:37.506
Yeah, Mark, you good?

96
00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:39.930
Okay, we got thumbs up everyone,
just making sure.

97
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.877
Twitch, you good?

98
00:04:40.877 --> 00:04:41.772
Yeah, no, yeah?

99
00:04:41.772 --> 00:04:43.724
Frontendmasters.com, yeah, no, yeah?

100
00:04:43.724 --> 00:04:45.868
All right, everyone says, yeah, okay,
we've got a couple of nos in there but

101
00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:47.221
mostly yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

102
00:04:47.221 --> 00:04:49.636
Okay, now we're getting a lot
of nos in there, I'm sorry.

103
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:56.316
Sorry, fantastic times.
