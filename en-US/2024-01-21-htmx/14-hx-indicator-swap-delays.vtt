1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.461
But still this doesn't feel interactive,
right?

2
00:00:02.461 --> 00:00:06.769
We want it to feel like something's
happening cuz right now it just kind of

3
00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:07.400
pops out.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.029
You don't know if a request has been made,
you don't know what's happening.

5
00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:11.124
Are you going to press it multiple times?

6
00:00:11.124 --> 00:00:12.084
Are you freaked out?

7
00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:13.410
You could be freaked out.

8
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.621
So let's start by adding
a simple time delay right here.

9
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.530
So I'm gonna go Sleep, and
hopefully one second, pretty good.

10
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.951
I'm gonna first started
off with 3 seconds, so

11
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:25.326
it's like really obvious to see and
feel the terribleness of this.

12
00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:27.733
So I'm gonna just press
this button over this.

13
00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:28.613
Is it requesting?

14
00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:31.834
We don't even know what that okay,
there we go, it got deleted,

15
00:00:31.834 --> 00:00:32.959
it just disappeared.

16
00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:34.450
If you had a big list of items,

17
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.215
also in something shifted it
might be very hard to see.

18
00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:41.181
It's not a great experience we should
probably fix all of these things at

19
00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:42.034
the same time.

20
00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:46.506
So we have two options we have
hx-indicator and swap delays.

21
00:00:46.506 --> 00:00:49.567
Both are very exciting and
both solve different problems.

22
00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.104
So let's start off with the indicator,
okay?

23
00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:55.006
I want you to add these two
lines to your server which

24
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:58.259
is just saying hey statically
serve these directories.

25
00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:03.659
I'll paste it in twitch chat
boomer websites are the best,

26
00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.908
I mean fair statement, all right?

27
00:01:06.908 --> 00:01:12.241
So I'm gonna go up to the Tippity top
up here and I'm just gonna say, hey.

28
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:14.559
There you go, serve out images,
serve out css.

29
00:01:14.559 --> 00:01:17.651
That's why I had you kind of
use this project to begin with

30
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:19.852
because there is css, there is images.

31
00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:22.823
You can look at it, we have some
stuff in there, that's gonna be nice.

32
00:01:22.823 --> 00:01:24.699
So pretty simple right there.

33
00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:29.990
Next we need to add this css link, so
that we have this beautiful css on here.

34
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.924
It's only three lines of css, so I'm gonna
go back to my template, go up to the tip

35
00:01:33.924 --> 00:01:37.480
of the top, go to the head, add that
wonderful piece of code right there.

36
00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.836
If you wanna use the course website,
go for it.

37
00:01:39.836 --> 00:01:42.875
There we go, and we also have this little
beautiful image that we're gonna be using.

38
00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:47.077
I took this directly from
the HTMX website, okay?

39
00:01:47.077 --> 00:01:51.193
It's my image now,
that's mine it's our image, all right?

40
00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:54.350
All right, fantastic,
I just tried to literally quick,

41
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.871
I just typed in colon
right Enter on a website.

42
00:01:56.871 --> 00:02:01.559
That's not how you copy something,
it's just I can't help but to do that,

43
00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.647
it's just in my head, but
just do it, all right?

44
00:02:04.647 --> 00:02:06.395
So let's go and let's add that line.

45
00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:07.093
What was the line?

46
00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:08.934
Sorry, I got completely confused there.

47
00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:09.598
All right,

48
00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:13.990
so let's go all the way down here, we want
to add one more item to this contact.

49
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.310
I'm going to add in this
beautiful image right here.

50
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.634
So let's just see what
the image looks like,

51
00:02:19.634 --> 00:02:21.783
it's a little loading icon right there.

52
00:02:21.783 --> 00:02:24.242
How nice is that little loading icon?

53
00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:27.872
Our icon, that is, all right, so
I'm gonna add one more item to it.

54
00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:32.590
It's gonna call it div
class = htmx-indicator.

55
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.242
Now that is what that css is for.

56
00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:38.364
This is a generalized way to solve this
problem, and so you can use this for

57
00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:41.639
all indicators, so
let's look at that css one more time.

58
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.661
If you have indicator on your class,
we set your opacity to 0 and

59
00:02:45.661 --> 00:02:50.290
we have a transition of 500 milliseconds
if it were to become visible.

60
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.346
Then remember how there's all those
events that happen with htmx?

61
00:02:54.346 --> 00:02:57.823
Well, when an element
is a part of a request,

62
00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:01.491
htmx-request will be
added to its class list.

63
00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:03.373
So notice that I say this,

64
00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:08.604
if one of our parents has an htmx-request
than our opacity becomes one.

65
00:03:08.604 --> 00:03:13.406
If we have that, our opacity becomes 1, so
we can kind of define both possibilities.

66
00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:17.791
And so that way we can load
an indicator and show it upon request.

67
00:03:17.791 --> 00:03:19.857
So now we have that nice delay,
everything should be good.

68
00:03:19.857 --> 00:03:21.986
So let's refresh it,
obviously nothing's there.

69
00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:27.121
When I click Delete, What happened?

70
00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:28.677
Well, nothing,
we didn't actually add the indicator.

71
00:03:28.677 --> 00:03:30.717
So let's go back over here.

72
00:03:30.717 --> 00:03:34.538
And when we do a delete,
I'm gonna add one more attribute here and

73
00:03:34.538 --> 00:03:38.237
go hx-indicator =,
now we need to have some way to target it.

74
00:03:38.237 --> 00:03:44.295
So we'll add a simple id,
id = contact indicator,

75
00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:48.437
id, yeah, look at that beauty.

76
00:03:48.437 --> 00:03:51.233
That is beautiful, isn't it?

77
00:03:51.233 --> 00:03:51.858
There we go.

78
00:03:51.858 --> 00:03:57.151
We now have, hey, the indicator for
this action exists in this location.

79
00:03:57.151 --> 00:03:58.636
And so when that happens,

80
00:03:58.636 --> 00:04:02.086
it's going to do all the addition
of things you needed to do.

81
00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:03.007
So pretty nice.

82
00:04:03.007 --> 00:04:05.819
So I'm gonna hit Refresh, and
now when I hit the Delete,

83
00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.276
that thing will nicely show up during
the duration of the request, and

84
00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:10.928
then be removed when it's done.

85
00:04:10.928 --> 00:04:13.637
If we look at the actual elements,
let's look at the actual elements so

86
00:04:13.637 --> 00:04:14.777
we can see what happens here.

87
00:04:14.777 --> 00:04:19.482
So, when I hit that delete,
notice that htmx-request is

88
00:04:19.482 --> 00:04:23.430
just added automatically to that class for
you.

89
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.437
So you don't have to think about it.

90
00:04:24.437 --> 00:04:27.531
It allows you to have these things
added and there's actually more

91
00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:30.915
classes that we can we can get,
which we will get here in just one second.

92
00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:35.902
So that is one way to add
some level of interactivity.

93
00:04:35.902 --> 00:04:40.426
It's good, but it's still, I mean,
it's shockingly declarative, right?

94
00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:42.930
We pretty much declared exactly
how our element behaves,

95
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.496
including where our indicator is and
how it should behave.

96
00:04:45.496 --> 00:04:48.133
So that's nice, but
it's still not as good.

97
00:04:48.133 --> 00:04:50.286
So now we're gonna add
something called a swap delay.

98
00:04:50.286 --> 00:04:56.193
So I want you to update your CSS with
this small little thing right here,

99
00:04:56.193 --> 00:04:58.664
contact.htmx-swapping.

100
00:04:58.664 --> 00:04:59.473
It's beautiful, okay.

101
00:04:59.473 --> 00:05:01.326
And you could obviously
just make this generalized.

102
00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:03.006
You could have a single way you do this,
or

103
00:05:03.006 --> 00:05:04.745
you could have it a unique way for
each one.

104
00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:07.065
We could use the max height thing,

105
00:05:07.065 --> 00:05:11.386
though trying to animate on max
height is extremely difficult.

106
00:05:11.386 --> 00:05:15.704
And there's all these CSS hacks you have
to do just to get height to go downwards.

107
00:05:15.704 --> 00:05:20.620
My goodness., I hate CSS sometimes,
I just wanna just punch, hate it.

108
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.564
Anyways okay so we have contact we have
this I'm going to add it to the CSS.

109
00:05:23.564 --> 00:05:26.258
So I'm just gonna walk over to the CSS and

110
00:05:26.258 --> 00:05:31.423
I'm just gonna paste this little bit in,
yes my CSS is clearly a skill issue.

111
00:05:31.423 --> 00:05:35.621
So we have this beautiful little piece of
CSS right here, so I'm gonna back to this.

112
00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:37.463
And now we obviously want to add, I mean,

113
00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:39.684
now we're getting into
like full front end here.

114
00:05:39.684 --> 00:05:43.374
Now we have this nice little class contact
on it, so we know how to say, hey,

115
00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:44.887
which one's gonna have this.

116
00:05:44.887 --> 00:05:50.584
Now, when we do this right here,
what's gonna end up happening,

117
00:05:50.584 --> 00:05:56.472
let's see, Is that, let's go back here.

118
00:05:56.472 --> 00:06:02.272
So now you can see it, this right here,
we have a target on it.

119
00:06:02.272 --> 00:06:06.661
When the target happens
before the swap happens,

120
00:06:06.661 --> 00:06:11.165
it adds an additional class htmx swap or
swapping.

121
00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:13.131
And it's gonna say, hey,
we're swapping out this element.

122
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.680
So if you need to do something with it,

123
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.917
you now have one visual hook in
your CSS to do something with it.

124
00:06:19.917 --> 00:06:25.818
And it also has something else, which
is I can go swap for 500 milliseconds.

125
00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:29.345
I want you to just give me
500 milliseconds on this so

126
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:31.729
I can make something pretty myself.

127
00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.270
So when we go back here,
and I click Delete,

128
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.890
it will do the whole indication for three
seconds and then the swap will happen.

129
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.023
We'll do that nice little fade out and
then it goes away.

130
00:06:41.023 --> 00:06:44.373
Now you imagine again you can do the whole
height thing, you can make that too much

131
00:06:44.373 --> 00:06:47.295
smoother experience, you can kind
of choose what you want to do here.

132
00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:50.510
And so it's just another way in which
case mix just gives you a bunch of events

133
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.071
to tap into.

134
00:06:51.071 --> 00:06:54.711
Its kind of your responsibility
to go the nine yards on this.

135
00:06:54.711 --> 00:06:58.554
And so I don't know I like that,
I think it's really, really simple and

136
00:06:58.554 --> 00:07:02.604
I think it really shows a great way to
make nice tools fairly simple, right?

137
00:07:02.604 --> 00:07:06.382
Cuz most of our life is making tools very
few things are maintaining very wonderful

138
00:07:06.382 --> 00:07:07.321
awesome websites.

139
00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:10.874
All the little ancillary things around
it you don't need to have an entire

140
00:07:10.874 --> 00:07:13.412
monolithic application for
just the simple stuff.
