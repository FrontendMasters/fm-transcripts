1
00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:04.611
This is great, but it's not really great
because I can just feel that everybody

2
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:06.570
here wants to see interactivity.

3
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.435
Right now we're just
seeing basic replacement.

4
00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:11.878
Yeah, that was awesome way
easier to use than just Ajax and

5
00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:16.805
trying to find HTML elements yourself,
but it's not any different at this point.

6
00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:19.489
So I want to win, I want a big win.

7
00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.371
So now remember this is also
a goal to learn htmx, so

8
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:26.642
will I be programming with
the world's greatest technique today?

9
00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:27.732
Absolutely not.

10
00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.602
Will we do things,
maybe some corners will be cut today?

11
00:00:30.602 --> 00:00:31.902
Absolutely fine.

12
00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:33.762
But our goal is to learn htmx.

13
00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.702
It's not to be good at programming today.

14
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.252
What?
No tailwind?

15
00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:39.962
What is this?
Twitter is in shambles right now!

16
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:43.943
Yes, we will not be using tailwind because
I'm gonna spend approximately zero seconds

17
00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.942
thinking about how this thing looks.

18
00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:50.679
I just want to show you how we can execute
things, how we can add interactivity,

19
00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.692
how we can do some hooking
in with JavaScript.

20
00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:55.654
And I'm only gonna show
just the surface of it,

21
00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.952
but as long as you can understand that,
okay?

22
00:00:57.952 --> 00:01:03.210
You can literally, not figuratively, but
actually literally use react with htmx.

23
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.583
You can use web components,
lit components, whatever you want.

24
00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:08.440
You can even raw docs and JS and
CSS in there if you need to.

25
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.266
We will probably be opting into the final
strategy today cuz it is the most

26
00:01:12.266 --> 00:01:14.410
straightforward to see how it's done.

27
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.030
The classic tailwind problem.

28
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.030
So we're gonna build a small
context application.

29
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.843
The application has a form that takes
in a name and an email and saves it.

30
00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:25.550
So the first thing we want to
do is create this email form, or

31
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.829
this form that takes in name and email.

32
00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.282
Every time we hit save, it will add
the name and email to the server,

33
00:01:31.282 --> 00:01:35.199
just in memory, and display
the updated list of names in email.

34
00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:38.548
Now you're probably asking no light,
are you serious?

35
00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:39.942
You're not even doing that,

36
00:01:39.942 --> 00:01:43.240
don't you love turso, isn't this
like a hashtag sponsored moment?

37
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.438
We could just have this totally workout?

38
00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:46.619
No, I don't want to do it.

39
00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.536
Again, this is just trying to be as
minimally viable product as possible

40
00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:55.095
cuz I really don't wanna
get bogged up on anything.

41
00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:58.658
So yes, every time we make a change
to our server, do we lose our data?

42
00:01:58.658 --> 00:01:59.830
Absolutely.

43
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.856
So first let's do the HTML part of
the server, which should be pretty easy.

44
00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:07.950
We're gonna build a form with name and
email and the submit button.

45
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.220
And then we've gotta build a display.

46
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.017
That is a list of names and emails and
contacts should be pretty straightforward.

47
00:02:14.017 --> 00:02:16.860
I think everyone here should be
able to do this quite easily, but

48
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.133
if you can't follow along.

49
00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.692
So we're gonna keep index.

50
00:02:20.692 --> 00:02:23.737
But we're gonna probably need to get rid
of all this get out of here we don't need

51
00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:25.110
that we don't need block account.

52
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.421
Let's start by building the form.

53
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:29.215
I wanna call this block form for form yes.

54
00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.364
Is that a good name?

55
00:02:30.364 --> 00:02:31.177
No, it's not.

56
00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:34.063
Is it a good name for
our application absolutely.

57
00:02:34.063 --> 00:02:37.342
Probably should have called it
create contact but we didn't.

58
00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:43.685
Now I'm not even gonna use that, we're
gonna use a pretty poor form of HTML here.

59
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.331
I'm gonna go name, and
this will be an input with,

60
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:48.305
let's see if Copilot can guess.

61
00:02:48.305 --> 00:02:51.911
We gotta type text, name is name,
values this, fantastic.

62
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:54.275
I'm gonna remove most of this.

63
00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.995
We don't actually need any of this.

64
00:02:55.995 --> 00:02:57.695
All right, awesome.

65
00:02:57.695 --> 00:03:01.077
So I'm just gonna have a very
simple input, which is name.

66
00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:05.737
I'm gonna take name, we're gonna
take name and replace it with email.

67
00:03:05.737 --> 00:03:06.487
That's not what we wanted.

68
00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:08.750
So there we go.
Pretty straightforward.

69
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.197
And I'm gonna make this type email.

70
00:03:10.197 --> 00:03:14.617
We're gonna use an HTML5
validation in here.

71
00:03:14.617 --> 00:03:18.107
Did you know that input types
can have validation full freeze?

72
00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:18.899
Yes, you can.

73
00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:20.458
Now, you could drive
this all by the server.

74
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.418
You could drive it by client side
stuff if you really wanted to.

75
00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:28.268
Right now we're just gonna drive it via
HTML5 validation and what the server says.

76
00:03:28.268 --> 00:03:31.227
We could get rid of this to make
life easier if I wanted to,

77
00:03:31.227 --> 00:03:32.656
do we wanna make it easier?

78
00:03:32.656 --> 00:03:37.445
We could just make it easier, but
let's just make it easier cuz honestly,

79
00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:39.130
it's just nicer to type.

80
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.601
I don't wanna have to think about things,
it just makes life easier.

81
00:03:41.601 --> 00:03:44.560
So there we go, fantastic.

82
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.465
Next, I'm gonna create a block display,
which again, poorly named, but

83
00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:50.080
it gets the point across.

84
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.190
We're gonna display the list of contacts.

85
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.874
All right, so

86
00:03:52.874 --> 00:03:56.980
this is where we're gonna just display
all the things we have in the server.

87
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.740
I'm gonna do the following.

88
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:05.161
Let's go a div on the outside nothing
like a good bowl of div soup and

89
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:11.134
then I'm gonna do a range over contacts,
oops, fantastic.

90
00:04:11.134 --> 00:04:14.357
And now I'm just gonna
display each contact and

91
00:04:14.357 --> 00:04:20.042
look at that it already did it for
me absolutely awesome I'll go name, email.

92
00:04:20.042 --> 00:04:21.119
This is pretty straightforward.

93
00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:25.150
So if you don't know about ranges in go
templates, it's pretty straightforward If

94
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.582
you could just go range.contacts,
it's I don't like this style.

95
00:04:28.582 --> 00:04:31.456
It really bothers me but
it just works out for this.

96
00:04:31.456 --> 00:04:35.103
It Implicitly changes the this object or
the dot to be referring to

97
00:04:35.103 --> 00:04:40.215
whatever we're ranging over not the outer
thing that was passed into the block Luck.

98
00:04:40.215 --> 00:04:41.585
So can this be annoying?

99
00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:43.245
Absolutely, do I love it?

100
00:04:43.245 --> 00:04:44.345
Absolutely not.

101
00:04:44.345 --> 00:04:45.982
But for the sake of our simple program,

102
00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:49.385
this templating language is more than
enough for us to get pretty dang far.

103
00:04:49.385 --> 00:04:52.217
And honestly, you can get really
far in Ghost's templating language.

104
00:04:52.217 --> 00:04:54.815
They have some ways to create
variables and all that.

105
00:04:54.815 --> 00:04:55.865
We're just not doing that today.

106
00:04:55.865 --> 00:04:56.776
We're keeping it simple.

107
00:04:56.776 --> 00:05:00.049
And lastly, we're gonna want
a little bit of styling on here.

108
00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:03.589
I'm gonna go display flex
I know I look at this,

109
00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:09.274
we're actually just doing CSS and
flex direction is a column, there we go.

110
00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:14.127
Can you believe that I actually
just got done doing inline CSS?

111
00:05:14.127 --> 00:05:16.467
You probably think I'm a front-end
engineer at this point.

112
00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:20.130
All right, so now that we've
built the form and the display.

113
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.233
Let's make sure we put it
into the actual index page.

114
00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:27.661
So I'm gonna go up here and we're gonna
go template form, template display,

115
00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:32.352
put a nice little hr betwixt them so
that way we can kinda see them separated.

116
00:05:32.352 --> 00:05:33.592
Pretty straightforward.

117
00:05:33.592 --> 00:05:36.001
Do the form, do the display,
let's move on.

118
00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:40.466
Now we do have a bit of a problem
when we build our server.

119
00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:43.946
We need an object with a contacts list,
so we're gonna do that here shortly.

120
00:05:45.016 --> 00:05:47.896
But let's see what we've got to do next.

121
00:05:47.896 --> 00:05:50.998
All right, so look at this, here's our
fully programmed HTML engineering,

122
00:05:50.998 --> 00:05:51.892
how close did I get?

123
00:05:51.892 --> 00:05:54.496
Man, look at how much more
professional I made this one.

124
00:05:54.496 --> 00:05:59.526
I did forget this, we do need to tell
the form where to post itself to.

125
00:05:59.526 --> 00:06:02.838
So I'm gonna jump back here,
I'm gonna go to the form and

126
00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:06.949
I'm gonna go hx-post equals
how about contacts, right?

127
00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.139
Feels pretty resty of me.

128
00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.741
So we're gonna post to contacts,
the name and the email and

129
00:06:11.741 --> 00:06:14.659
we also need a button that is a submit.

130
00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:16.469
So create contact.

131
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.634
Fantastic, so
we have a button that submits the form.

132
00:06:18.634 --> 00:06:20.409
Forgot a couple items, awesome.

133
00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.916
Let's go on.

134
00:06:20.916 --> 00:06:23.487
I'm barely just not a great HTML.

135
00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:25.997
My HTML engineering very poor.

136
00:06:25.997 --> 00:06:28.633
I'll look at that.
I didn't even do a flex container in this

137
00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:31.003
one file, just rookie material over here.

138
00:06:31.003 --> 00:06:33.047
All right, awesome.

139
00:06:33.047 --> 00:06:34.237
I like everything that I'm saying.
