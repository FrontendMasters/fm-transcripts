WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We still have the problem
pulling in React being a global module.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.634
And we don't want to do that.

4
00:00:10.634 --> 00:00:15.450
The other thing worth mentioning,
never modify bundle by hand, just FYI.

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.049
Just leave it out there and
let it run of its own.

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.940
Because as soon as you regenerate your
file, all of your changes get blown away.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.060
So just leave but alone don't touch
it just, yeah, don't touch it.

8
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.956
Okay, so
I want to get rid of this global React and

9
00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:38.672
I want to be able to pull it in locally.

10
00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.423
So, let's go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:44.483
So up here in my title.js,

12
00:00:44.483 --> 00:00:49.260
say var React = require react.

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.250
So remember we put dot
slash in front of MyTitle.

14
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.660
That's basically referring
to like I created this,

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.430
that this is my file that I'm pulling in,
right?

16
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.410
If I don't put that dot slash here,

17
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.760
it basically means that I have an npm
module that I installed right so

18
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.090
if you look at your package.JSON,
I pulled in React right?

19
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.570
So that will match up.

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.314
However your npm installed that
that's how you refer to it here.

21
00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:17.140
I pulled in React and
I want to pull that into this file.

22
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.660
Okay?

23
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.201
So save that in MyTitle, and
then also go over to ClientApp.js.

24
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:26.150
You can get rid of this global comment,

25
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.040
because they're no longer
going to be global.

26
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.474
And we're going to say var
React = require(react).

27
00:01:34.474 --> 00:01:37.716
And we're also going to pull in ReactDOM,

28
00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:43.671
because we're using it down at the bottom,
ReactDOM = require react-dom.

29
00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:53.151
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

30
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:56.353
So all we did is in client app,
we pulled in React and

31
00:01:56.353 --> 00:02:00.060
ReactDOM and
got rid of the global comment.

32
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.020
And then in MyTitle,
we just pulled in React as well.

33
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.750
Something else to keep in mind is Webpack
is smart enough to not include like

34
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.640
include React twice, right.

35
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.980
It has one copy of React that's given
to both these different files so

36
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.180
you can require everything,

37
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.940
everywhere to not worry about duplicating
your code just keep that in mind.

38
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.710
It was a worry for me so I mentioned
someone else worries about it to.

39
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.890
And, this is just code or guy trying
to have all my requires at the top.

40
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.185
Shouldn't affect anything as long as
you're requiring React before you say you

41
00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:39.610
refer to it, up to you.

42
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.570
Okay, so let's go ahead and
run webpack again,

43
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.720
we can just run literally
the same command.

44
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you're pulling in
require, you don't need to the scripts or

45
00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.171
the index, the index.html,
do you need to pull in React still?

46
00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:57.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, good point as well.

47
00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.710
In fact, reactive will yell
at you if you don't do that.

48
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.010
So these two scripts up here.

49
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.406
Yeah, go ahead and just delete that.

50
00:03:11.423 --> 00:03:11.975
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

51
00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:14.211
Because now everything's
being put into bundle.

52
00:03:25.025 --> 00:03:27.239
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so run webpack again.

53
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.334
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so now you have
ClientApp, you have MyTitle and

54
00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:37.497
then you have 158 hidden modules.

55
00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:41.741
The word hidden modules makes me
like really frightened inside,

56
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:46.292
I don't know if anyone else but
that's just, that's all of react and

57
00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:50.410
all of its dependencies as well
right now getting it included.

58
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.870
That's the hidden modules part.

59
00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:01.011
And now if you look at public,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Notice

60
00:04:01.011 --> 00:04:05.955
this got way bigger [LAUGH] and
the reason why it got way bigger is

61
00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:10.250
cuz React is actually a fairly
decent sized library.

62
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.420
But now if you come over here,
refresh the page, should still work.

63
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.833
And if you look down
here at your Network tab,

64
00:04:21.833 --> 00:04:25.583
you are just pulling in one bundle and
that's it.

65
00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:33.112
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's see,
I want to hard reload.

66
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.130
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well, it's cuz of that,
yeah, whatever, that's fine.

67
00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:41.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
any questions about that?

68
00:04:49.236 --> 00:04:53.361
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Great, so.

69
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:59.042
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Let's just take a show
of hands, like who got that point?

70
00:04:59.042 --> 00:05:00.300
Anybody need help?

71
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, anybody?

72
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Anybody
getting weird errors?

73
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you're
getting a weird error,

74
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.810
there's a 90% chance that you're
not the only one getting an error.

75
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.820
So like never feel ashamed to ask like
my shit's broken, please help me.

76
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you show
how to do the rerun webpack?

77
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Was it just the word

78
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.296
webpack?

79
00:05:23.296 --> 00:05:24.284
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Webpack.

80
00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:26.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, so
it's the whole phrase.

81
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.785
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Do you have to run that
whole command every time because it's

82
00:05:29.785 --> 00:05:30.770
specific to that bundle?

83
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.944
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, exactly because
you have to tell it where to enter, so

84
00:05:33.944 --> 00:05:37.066
we have to tell it,
please enter at ClientApp.js right?

85
00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:40.982
Cuz that's the main file, the way you'll
be able to tell you your main file is,

86
00:05:40.982 --> 00:05:44.120
your main file never has an export, right?

87
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.960
So you can't run a webpack on MyTitle.

88
00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.280
In fact,
it'll yell at you if you tried to do that.

89
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.215
This says hey, I can't do this,
it has an export.

90
00:05:54.538 --> 00:05:57.423
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It should, Jeez,
I guess that's no longer the case.

91
00:05:58.938 --> 00:06:02.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway,
it should never have an export and

92
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.010
then you also tell what
fire you want to generate.

93
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.730
But that's kind of annoying to have to
type that every single time, right.

94
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.334
So that's why we have npm scripts so we're
going to put that into an npm script and

95
00:06:15.334 --> 00:06:16.933
never have to worry about it again.

96
00:06:22.251 --> 00:06:25.889
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
come back over in fact to your

97
00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.671
package.json,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Put a new line in there

98
00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:34.141
that says build,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

99
00:06:34.141 --> 00:06:36.492
then just put whatever we had,
we've been running right?

100
00:06:36.492 --> 00:06:39.641
You can actually even just copy and
paste if that feels right to you.

101
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.638
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, save that.

102
00:06:50.638 --> 00:06:55.281
This line right here, geez, don't do that.

103
00:06:55.281 --> 00:07:01.617
[COUGH] Another helpful tip that
I kind of alluded to earlier.

104
00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:06.232
You see these yellow squares, that means
that something I've modified since I last

105
00:07:06.232 --> 00:07:09.807
committed, or if you see the plus
side of something I've added or

106
00:07:09.807 --> 00:07:13.002
if you see the red arrows that
means things I've deleted.

107
00:07:13.002 --> 00:07:16.409
So you can kind of see like the diff
of what we've been doing so far.

108
00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:17.499
And there might be helpful for

109
00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:20.160
you if you're trying to figure out
what I've changed one on the page.

110
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It might be
a good time to push and sync so

111
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.780
some of these people can
resolve their errors.

112
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:25.310
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Definitely.

113
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.060
I will do it right before I start
Babel which is the next thing.

114
00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:35.100
Okay, so I'll save that, say npm run build

115
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:45.897
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now you have to remember
the entry point or the exit point,

116
00:07:45.897 --> 00:07:48.350
you just say npm run build and
everything works.

117
00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:56.020
Also a good time to run npm test, see
what we've broken and luckily I didn't.

118
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:56.990
I've done a good job.

119
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.594
So, that's good, all right.

120
00:07:59.594 --> 00:08:01.455
So I'm gonna push up
a new branch real quick.

121
00:08:10.487 --> 00:08:11.806
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 4 right yep.

122
00:08:13.918 --> 00:08:15.452
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops.

123
00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:24.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, good.

124
00:08:24.344 --> 00:08:27.392
push origin fem-4.

125
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:35.002
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now if your
stuff is broken, just go ahead and

126
00:08:35.002 --> 00:08:40.070
grab fem-4 and
you should be back on the same page as us.
