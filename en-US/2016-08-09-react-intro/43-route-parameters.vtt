00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.147
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:07.080
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's start talking
about marshalling data in React.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.521
So, we're gonna create another route, and
we're gonna call it details search.jsx.

4
00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:20.170
&gt;&gt; Brian: Inside of the JS folder.

5
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.357
Okay, and we'll bring in react.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

6
00:00:30.357 --> 00:00:33.260
let's do this one of the JSX
class because, why not?

7
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.249
[LAUGH] So, you can see both
of the both ways of doing it.

8
00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:59.040
&gt;&gt; Brian: ClassName Equals container.

9
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:07.350
You know what, actually we don't
even need, we do need container.

10
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.710
Yeah, that's right.

11
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.630
Yeah, and we're just going to put,
you can put anything in here.

12
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.040
Just going to do that for now, and then
make sure you export at the bottom, okay?

13
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.503
About the most basic ES6

14
00:01:31.503 --> 00:01:37.310
class component you can do.

15
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.900
To address Brit's question there,

16
00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.100
what about the browser five
version of hot module reload?

17
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.250
All I know is it's just starting to exist,

18
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.960
that's about the best
thing I can say about it.

19
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.000
That browser five's new version
has some concept of it or

20
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.240
it might even be a plug
in the browser five.

21
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.780
Anyway Webpack has been doing it
since the inception of Webpack.

22
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.820
And I think browser fires,
either via the community or

23
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.410
via the project itself just
catching up and doing it.

24
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.880
It's valid I can say but
I've never personally done it so

25
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.856
can't really much tell you.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,

26
00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:21.890
so let's go use our new route details.

27
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.880
Sorry excuse me in the client app.JSX.
&gt;&gt; Brian: We'll pull that in here as well.

28
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.645
Const details equals require.slash

29
00:02:35.645 --> 00:02:40.293
details, and down here,

30
00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:46.421
I'm going to say route path equals

31
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:51.930
slash details slash colon ID.

32
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.511
We'll talk about that here momentarily,

33
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:02.170
component equals details, okay?

34
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.360
So, what are we doing here?

35
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.860
This, for those who do have written
the service side routing code,

36
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.060
this might look like familiar syntax for
you.

37
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.360
Definitely this is the way
you do it in Express, and

38
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.150
I think lots of other frameworks
choose to do display as well.

39
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.800
This is basically saying that I'm gonna
have details which is going to be

40
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.050
like that the name of the route
trade details And then calling ID.

41
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.010
Basically says something
else is going to come here.

42
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.320
It's going to be some sort of ID.

43
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:46.318
So if I go to
http://localhost:8080/details/15

44
00:03:46.318 --> 00:03:53.868
it's actually gonna be like tt123456.

45
00:03:53.868 --> 00:03:56.520
Right, that's this right here
is going to be the details and

46
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.400
that's going to be passed into my router.

47
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.310
And that's the basic just
of what's going on there.

48
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.690
So this is just saying that you're
gonna pass something in here And

49
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.800
that will be passed under the route and
the route can deal with it.

50
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.590
Why this is useful slash important is that

51
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.740
these details pages we're going to
make a individual detail page for

52
00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.290
each one of our movies and
we are, TV shows rather.

53
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.690
And we want to be able to make that page
flexible enough to handle any one of

54
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.400
the TV shows.

55
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.801
We don't make an individual route for
every single one We're doing, so let's

56
00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:36.935
just adds some flexibility to our router.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question,

57
00:04:36.935 --> 00:04:39.660
since we're using hash history.

58
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.480
How does it know not to
substitute the hash with

59
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.300
the ID?
&gt;&gt; Brian: How does it know not

60
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.660
to substitute the hash with your idea.

61
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.570
I'm not sure that I follow your question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Whenever we

62
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.210
go to search something and then and

63
00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.530
add hashtag something?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right.

64
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.000
So it's actually in All right.

65
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.321
It's gonnalike this,

66
00:05:03.321 --> 00:05:07.653
something like that, right.

67
00:05:07.653 --> 00:05:13.615
Is that sidestep your
question sufficiently?

68
00:05:13.615 --> 00:05:18.381
[LAUGH] Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,

69
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:27.052
good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,

70
00:05:27.052 --> 00:05:29.610
so let's go actually try that now.

71
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.360
Make sure first of all your
Webpack is still running.

72
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.419
Mine still is right?

73
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.265
But just make sure that's running in the
background, hopefully you are not getting

74
00:05:39.265 --> 00:05:47.630
a ton of glinting errors.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So come in here.

75
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.194
Refresh your page and
change this to be details Slash one two

76
00:05:52.194 --> 00:05:56.670
three four which doesn't
really matter what's there and

77
00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.341
you should see a new route here
over with whatever you put in.

78
00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.116
&gt;&gt; Brian: Most people seen

79
00:06:09.116 --> 00:06:13.814
this.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cool.

80
00:06:19.347 --> 00:06:21.051
&gt;&gt; Brian: So again we just added this new

81
00:06:21.051 --> 00:06:25.415
route here And then we just added the
basically the most basic component here

82
00:06:25.415 --> 00:06:34.760
possible here in details.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

83
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.400
So I wanna show you everything that's
getting passed down to your route.

84
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.500
So this is the details are route, right?

85
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.950
So replace whatever you put here with.

86
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.800
Precode and put in here,

87
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:58.642
we've done this before,
JSON.stringify(this.props,

88
00:06:58.642 --> 00:07:03.200
null, 4) By the way, I totally stole this.

89
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:06.220
I did not think of this like this
little debugging technique here,

90
00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.830
from Ryan Florence who's
the author of react router.

91
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.350
So also don't give me credit for that one.

92
00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.820
Okay.

93
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.381
So refresh your page now and
you should see a lot of stuff right,

94
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:28.133
like this get a lot of stuff is
getting passed down to your route from

95
00:07:28.133 --> 00:07:32.591
the router.
&gt;&gt; Brian: The most

96
00:07:32.591 --> 00:07:37.320
interesting thing that you wanna find And
here is params, right here.

97
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:44.881
I'll make it bigger so you can see it.

98
00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:45.790
Notice that I put in 12345 up here.

99
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.760
I can change it to be,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right?

100
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.810
This allows you access to this
id that we put in up here.

101
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:59.556
So whatever we change to be up here
&gt;&gt; Brian: Right

102
00:07:59.556 --> 00:08:01.330
that's gonna be passed down to your route.

103
00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:05.955
That's, the important thing that
I want you to get out of this.

104
00:08:11.769 --> 00:08:15.419
&gt;&gt; Brian: If you want to make this look

105
00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:21.609
a little bit nicer you can say,
style equals,

106
00:08:21.609 --> 00:08:25.896
text align [INAUDIBLE] Text align

107
00:08:25.896 --> 00:08:31.148
left,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And that

108
00:08:31.148 --> 00:08:37.620
should make this look nice there you go.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

109
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.650
will you pass the id into the route?

110
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.130
As a property.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

111
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:45.780
A react router does it for
you automatically.

112
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.760
And it's exposed via the params.

113
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.650
Great.

114
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.230
This is an awesome way to debug state 2,
by the way.

115
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.170
It's actually,
it's probably even more compelling to

116
00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.880
debug state that way.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You can make a debug

117
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.340
component.
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's actually not a bad idea.

118
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Then just pass it a JSON

119
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.350
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, definitely could.

120
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.863
The nice thing about doing with state
is you can actually like if you click

121
00:09:26.863 --> 00:09:30.135
something you immediately see the state
reflected to the way that reactor renders

122
00:09:30.135 --> 00:09:31.242
itself every single time.

123
00:09:31.242 --> 00:09:35.732
Yeah, pretty compelling.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You recommend

124
00:09:35.732 --> 00:09:39.942
using the React browser plugin.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,

125
00:09:39.942 --> 00:09:42.398
actually there's a whole
section on that in here.

126
00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:47.305
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian: I mean my personal opinion is

127
00:09:47.305 --> 00:09:49.171
that writing code is
more about debugging and

128
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:51.640
maintainability than actually
writing new feature code.

129
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:54.690
And so I'm trying to give you every
tool I can to debug your code.
