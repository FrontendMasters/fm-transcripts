00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.657
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:04.407
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, as you see,

3
00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:07.860
I've already had like a dozen syntax
errors through sort of this workshop.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.690
So it's really nice to have a tool
that tells you hey you're screwing

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.380
your crap up.

6
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.400
Let's fix your crap.

7
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.720
I'm a big fan of Yes Clinton in
general but there's also JS hint.

8
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.870
There's JS Lint JSCS, right?

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.250
JavaScript style checker?

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.420
Yeah, Check style, JavaScript Check Style.

11
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.170
We're going to use one called Standard,
which

12
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.649
it aims to be the standard formatter for
JavaScript with mild success.

13
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.130
Because a lot people don't
like the no semicolons rule.

14
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.020
But it kind of aims to be like,
does anyone write Go in here?

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.960
It aims to be like Go format.

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.610
The nice thing about the Go community
is everything is exactly one style.

17
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.020
They have a tool built in to Go that just
makes everyone's code looks the same way.

18
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.402
There's no discussion about it ever,
which is really nice,

19
00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.882
because bike shedding's really annoying.

20
00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:06.410
I thought that's what
Standard's trying to be.

21
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.520
I think it's a fun experiment, again.

22
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.880
But it's kind of up to you to
later to see if you wanna use it.

23
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.840
But, let's go ahead and try it.

24
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.430
So, go over to your command line.

25
00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:24.510
And actually, I know it's going to have
at least one error here right now.

26
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.700
So you're going to do.

27
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.932
Well first of all,
let's just add a new branch real quick.

28
00:01:48.237 --> 00:01:52.555
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so that the new
branch's out there under fem-3.

29
00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:57.515
Okay, if you haven't already

30
00:01:57.515 --> 00:02:02.293
do npm install -g standard.

31
00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:05.119
That you get to the tool
that we're looking for.

32
00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.844
In particular, what I like about standard
is like it's not configurable like

33
00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:12.779
it's just one way and so,
if you don't like it,

34
00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:17.361
then don't use standard right to the point
of standard is that there's zero

35
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.184
discussion about it like
this is the way it is.

36
00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:24.322
And I find that appealing because if
you've ever set up an ES Lint config file,

37
00:02:24.322 --> 00:02:27.647
it just feels like there's ten
billion dials to slightly tweak

38
00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.999
a bunch of different ways and this just
like removes that cognitive load from you.

39
00:02:33.768 --> 00:02:36.670
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then it's really
easy to run, you just type standard.

40
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.348
And it gives you a bunch of errors,
holy crap.

41
00:02:40.348 --> 00:02:43.710
All right, React is not defined.

42
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.300
Okay, we knew that one, and then the other
one which I knew is gonna happen too

43
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.450
is h2, remember we were using h2 for a
little bit, and then we stopped using it?

44
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.936
So, that's a problem as well.

45
00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:58.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Bless you.

46
00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.959
Another bunch of these is like react is.

47
00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.030
So, it doesn't like globals that
you don't tell it about, right.

48
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.510
And basically, this is actually the most
useful part of linting tool for

49
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.380
JavaScript period the end
is unused variables.

50
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.590
Because a lot of people do things
like ce equals this, right?

51
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.130
And then we'll do, like,
down here, we'll say, cf, right?

52
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.386
Cuz we accidentally mistyped
instead of ce, right?

53
00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:23.840
And, your linter will catch this for,
hey, you were referring for

54
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.260
something that you didn't create.

55
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.593
You probably have a typo.

56
00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:33.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so, let's
fix this, the h2 ones is really easy.

57
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.870
Good, I didn't even make it an h2.

58
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.140
Good job, Brian.

59
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.140
Okay, so let's just delete that.

60
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.640
That will solve one of our problems.

61
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.760
And then, sometimes those,
these globals are necessary, right.

62
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.180
For example, it is necessary
because we're referring to React.

63
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.752
So basically what you do is you're
gonna put a comment up here at the top.

64
00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:55.200
And you're just gonna say, global.

65
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.190
And then just list all of your
globals that you intend on having.

66
00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.696
So we have React and ReactDOM.

67
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:12.203
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is just a little
bit of information for Standard to say,

68
00:04:12.203 --> 00:04:17.989
okay, you expect to have these
globals available to you.

69
00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:23.016
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

70
00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:25.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And
you have to have that comments syntax?

71
00:04:25.157 --> 00:04:26.929
It can't be the slash, slash?

72
00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:27.737
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Slash, slash?

73
00:04:27.737 --> 00:04:28.708
Yeah.

74
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:29.763
As far as I know.

75
00:04:29.763 --> 00:04:32.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,
I'm just gonna leave it.

76
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I like how it's like you
don't have a new at the end of the file.

77
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.

78
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.490
All right standard.

79
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.620
We'll put that new line in there.

80
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It insists and

81
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.660
actually I don't talk about editor
config in here, but I can actually,

82
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.093
I'll show you, I'll talk about editor
config in just like two seconds here.

83
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.770
Okay, good?

84
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.190
So let's run standard again.

85
00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.660
Yes!

86
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.075
No errors, nailed it.

87
00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:01.883
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And
it doesn't even say great.

88
00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:02.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No.

89
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.904
It's pretty judgmental.

90
00:05:03.904 --> 00:05:06.110
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're an idiot and

91
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.153
it's like, and then you do it again and
nothing is wrong is like, whatever.

92
00:05:11.153 --> 00:05:12.109
You're sufficient.

93
00:05:12.109 --> 00:05:16.664
[LAUGH] Yeah it should tell you like,
hi five good job or

94
00:05:16.664 --> 00:05:20.725
should use like emojis or
something like that.

95
00:05:20.725 --> 00:05:26.210
Okay, so,
did anyone else get the no new line error?

96
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.060
It's kind of a pain in the butt.

97
00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.026
So, there's a tool called EditorConfig,

98
00:05:34.026 --> 00:05:39.127
with the lovely mouse
is the the logo here.

99
00:05:39.127 --> 00:05:43.989
And basically EditorConfig is is it's just
like this file that you put at the root

100
00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:47.565
directory of your project and
then anyone that comes in your

101
00:05:47.565 --> 00:05:52.525
project automatically has their editor set
up to be writing the same style as you.

102
00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:58.635
So, to give you an example, I have
a file here already at your project and

103
00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:02.495
if you look at it, it's going to say
indent size two, indent style spaces.

104
00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.980
Insert final newline so you totally
sidestepped that problem altogether true.

105
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:12.840
What charset you are using,
all that stuff.

106
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.830
So, if you want to use that,
just come over here to EditorConfig and

107
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.850
then you say download a plugin and
they have it for

108
00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.250
just about everything which
is really nice, right.

109
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.310
So if you just download that,

110
00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:30.120
it's automatically gonna configure
any time you're in that project.

111
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.474
Doesn't affect your global like settings,
it's just for

112
00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:35.494
whatever you're in that project.

113
00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:42.046
Again for Sublime, you just search for
EditorConfig using Package control,

114
00:06:42.046 --> 00:06:47.140
and you'll find it, and
download it, and it just works.

115
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.740
And a bunch of open source projects
include these editor config files.

116
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.360
So, you don't even have to worry about it.

117
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Cool.

118
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:59.150
Yeah, like room of the bottom space or the
line and just hit save and it like add it.

119
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.494
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a red background.

120
00:07:00.494 --> 00:07:03.609
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And it's cool.

121
00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:06.925
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Super nice.

122
00:07:06.925 --> 00:07:13.740
See I go ahead and
grab that if you don't already have it.

123
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.110
Okay again,
worth mentioning standardist is ESLint,

124
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.300
it's just a preconfigured ESLint.

125
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.190
So eventually, we're going to plug in
at that because we also want to be able

126
00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:27.260
to lint our React and have like,
react specifically linting rules.

127
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.205
And that's mess to be able to do that.

128
00:07:33.063 --> 00:07:36.575
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if you want to see
like all the rules that standard does on

129
00:07:36.575 --> 00:07:38.550
the web page, I have a link to it.

130
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.967
You can also just look at
the standard repo on GitHub and

131
00:07:41.967 --> 00:07:43.762
I'll tell you all about it.

132
00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:46.460
Okay, so
I wanna say at this point if you are so

133
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.700
offended by not using semicolons like one,
why?

134
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:53.151
But two,
there's a package called semistandard.

135
00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:58.500
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which I thought was
a super clever name by the way like

136
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.700
doesn't anyone.

137
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:04.283
So it's everything in
standard except it enforces

138
00:08:04.283 --> 00:08:08.659
that you actually must
use semicolons instead.

139
00:08:08.659 --> 00:08:11.975
So, feel free to use that
to your own great shame.

140
00:08:11.975 --> 00:08:14.473
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just kidding.

141
00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:15.960
That's a terrible thing to say.

142
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.363
Okay, so any questions so
far about Standard?

143
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.960
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [COUGH] Excuse me.

144
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.460
Something else interesting that they're
working on, or actually have worked on,

145
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.500
is a something called standard format,
which is also kind of an interesting tool,

146
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.820
I don't use it cuz I've had mixed
results with its abilities.

147
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.640
But what it'll do, it'll actually try and
fix your code on the fly too so

148
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.360
like it says like you have an error here.

149
00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.570
And I think I know how to fix it so
I'm gonna try and just fix it for you.

150
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:54.150
I don't even give you
an error I just fix it.

151
00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.100
And I get weird indentations
on it sometimes.

152
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.530
I'd generally like not to use it.

153
00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:02.070
But you're welcome to give it a try.

154
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:04.870
Is not gonna meant to be
like Go format as well.

155
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.379
And what Go format does it
just automatically formats

156
00:09:07.379 --> 00:09:08.668
your code the correct way.
