00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.085
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're going to have to
do a bit of refactoring of many parts of

3
00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:10.630
our app to actually get
this to work correctly.

4
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.180
So first thing I want to do,
we don't have to do this but

5
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.830
this is going to make things much easier,
we're going to move all of our shows to

6
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.579
redux, cuz that's just going to
everything way easier to deal with.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.440
Then we don't have to be
passing it around everywhere.

8
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So go to store.jsx,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

9
00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.490
what we're gonna do here is we're
gonna add another require up here.

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:41.741
We're gonna say const shows
= require(../public/data).

11
00:00:47.822 --> 00:00:50.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then an initial state.

12
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.920
We're going to put shows in here as well.

13
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.870
So I'm just gonna say shows, right?

14
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.349
Remember that this works because
we were doing shows shows right?

15
00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.220
But we can also just do that.

16
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.520
And then we also need to pass this
into all the connected props,

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.550
so we have to update
our map state to props.

18
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.370
So it's made for some multi-liner.

19
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.489
And we're gonna say

20
00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:25.819
shows: state.shows.

21
00:01:42.474 --> 00:01:44.854
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I did that wrong
initially but that's fine.

22
00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:48.753
[LAUGH] My notes are wrong.

23
00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:53.306
Again, this makes sense, what we've done
to redux here is now we're just passing

24
00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:56.313
shows in with our payload,
with the rest of our state.

25
00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:59.590
So the nice thing is we don't have
to be requiring shows everywhere.

26
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.290
And we can get rid of all that
boiler plate logic that was taking

27
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.870
advantage of that.

28
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.534
So let's go and refactor details first.

29
00:02:09.934 --> 00:02:12.155
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
save that, move to details.

30
00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:19.084
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna bring in our
connector because this is not a connected

31
00:02:19.084 --> 00:02:19.985
component yet.

32
00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:23.529
This needs to be in curly braces.

33
00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:34.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Require('./Store'), right?

34
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.290
So fun part is here,
instead of doing params,

35
00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:51.156
what we're gonna do here
is we're just going to

36
00:02:51.156 --> 00:02:57.125
say this.props.shows,

37
00:02:57.125 --> 00:03:03.668
this.props.params.id.

38
00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:09.640
So what we're

39
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.440
doing before is we're letting on enter
take care of this selection of a show, but

40
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.950
because now it's in redux we might as well
just use redux since it's already there.

41
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.970
So we just changed the right half of this
assignment to be this stuff probs.show.

42
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.544
This.props.params.id.

43
00:03:33.524 --> 00:03:38.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now go down to your prop types.

44
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.784
This is going to be shows now,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

45
00:03:42.784 --> 00:03:47.480
this is actually going to be an array of,
so I'm gonna say an arrayOf.

46
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.287
And I'm gonna say arrayOf(object),
which is required.

47
00:04:03.247 --> 00:04:05.925
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, and then we also need
to use our connector down here as well.

48
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:18.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that should fix all of
details to use redux instead of depending

49
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.705
on it from onEnter.

50
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.710
Let's also go fix search
while we're at it.

51
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.389
Search will be pretty easy, which is nice.

52
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.610
Search.
So what we're going to do up here

53
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.520
is we're going to refactor this where
it says this.props.route.shows.

54
00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.920
We're just going to delete route.

55
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.240
And here where it says route,

56
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.042
we're actually going to change
this to be the same thing.

57
00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:52.430
Shows: ArrayOf(object), and

58
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.095
we just gonna bring that in
with our PropTypes as well

59
00:05:02.777 --> 00:05:06.675
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's it for search.

60
00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:09.077
Since it was already connected right,
so we don't have to connect it again.

61
00:05:15.676 --> 00:05:17.516
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
any questions about what we did to search?

62
00:05:20.596 --> 00:05:21.662
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They're asking,

63
00:05:21.662 --> 00:05:25.950
can you go over how the show is
passed down to the details for redux?

64
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:26.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

65
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:29.070
So we're using redux here, right?

66
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.880
So we have shows which we're putting into
our redux store when we initialize it,

67
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.180
and then never changing it right?

68
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.200
We're never touching redux or we're never

69
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.940
touching the shows after we put it into
redux, that's what I meant to say.

70
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.170
And then here,
we're doing map state to props.

71
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.710
Now anywhere that is a connected
component that we use with this connector

72
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.500
right here, is automatically going
to get shows pass into its props.

73
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.420
That's where that
automatically is showing up.

74
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.228
It's thanks to the magic
of reactRedux connector.

75
00:06:08.686 --> 00:06:09.416
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

76
00:06:09.416 --> 00:06:12.134
Does that make sense?

77
00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:15.702
This is the same principles of how
we're passing around search term,

78
00:06:15.702 --> 00:06:18.155
it's the same way we're
passing on the shows.

79
00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:22.713
This is just another branch
of our redux state tree.

80
00:06:28.414 --> 00:06:31.034
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
let's go fix client app finally.

81
00:06:31.034 --> 00:06:33.875
This is fun cuz we get to
delete a bunch of stuff.

82
00:06:33.875 --> 00:06:36.275
In fact,
all we have to do is delete stuff.

83
00:06:37.325 --> 00:06:40.780
So delete this, the shows part,
from the requires.

84
00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:49.379
[SOUND] Delete shows from search.

85
00:06:49.379 --> 00:06:52.238
So delete this part right here.

86
00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:59.256
Delete assign show,
we don't need this anymore.

87
00:06:59.256 --> 00:07:04.012
[SOUND] And delete assign show being

88
00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:08.940
passed down here, on the onEnter.

89
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.860
So notice our client app just
got ten times more simple.

90
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.120
Which is pretty cool, right?

91
00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that's what I like about redux.

92
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.110
By externalizing our state,
our react components get to be more dumb,

93
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.930
which is always a good thing.

94
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.322
You want your UI usually
to be pretty dumb.

95
00:07:32.262 --> 00:07:35.642
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions
about what I did to client app?

96
00:07:40.862 --> 00:07:45.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, looks like
people want to see details again, so

97
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:46.850
we'll hop over there.

98
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:49.610
Make sure you're saving
everything along the way too.

99
00:07:53.070 --> 00:08:00.430
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here, we did
connector to get it connected to redux.

100
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:06.677
We added a propType as well and that
arrayOf to get the right kind of propType.

101
00:08:06.677 --> 00:08:11.300
The only thing we changed up here,
besides this require up here,

102
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:16.682
it's getting the proper show from
this.props.shows right because shows

103
00:08:16.682 --> 00:08:22.530
is being passed in this as a prop and
then we're using this.props.params.id.

104
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:26.010
This is the param,
this is the ID from the URL.

105
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.710
If you remember correctly,
that react router gives us.

106
00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:29.780
And so we're just pulling it out.

107
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.230
This is not going to work
the way that I think it is.

108
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.140
Nope, okay, so.

109
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think they're saying you
need to add a params to the propType?

110
00:08:40.497 --> 00:08:42.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
that's gonna be true too.

111
00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:49.120
So yeah, I have to make this a little
bit more complicated than I wanted to.

112
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.761
So.

113
00:08:52.241 --> 00:08:54.061
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is
Science Show Business.

114
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:00.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I need to get this logic from here.

115
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:03.740
I need the same logic that I had up here.

116
00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.240
So.

117
00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:11.101
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's
not what I wanted to do.

118
00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:18.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
that should be fine, go back to details.

119
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.470
The dangers of changing things
while you're writing them.

120
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.082
So if you put this here, I don't actually
want that, I want a signed show and

121
00:09:30.082 --> 00:09:35.810
I want it to take it in an id.

122
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.820
And then I just want
this to be equal to id.

123
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:46.740
And I'm gonna do this
with this.props.shows.

124
00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.834
Get rid of this replace thing,
I don't need that.

125
00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:52.654
&gt;&gt; Sneezing Student: [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Bless you.

126
00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:58.261
And then instead I'm

127
00:09:58.261 --> 00:10:06.364
going to return showArray 0.

128
00:10:06.364 --> 00:10:11.197
Equals, okay, so

129
00:10:11.197 --> 00:10:16.029
now I want this to be

130
00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:21.474
this.assignShow.

131
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.226
And I wanted to pass in
this.props.params.id.

132
00:10:28.226 --> 00:10:33.450
Okay, so this is doing the same
logic that we were doing before but

133
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:37.150
it's going to filter it down to exactly
the one that we want, return that, and

134
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.720
that's going to be our show right here.

135
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.291
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Do you want to
remove the comma in there?

136
00:10:46.891 --> 00:10:49.391
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is not a, it is.

137
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:50.351
It is a class.

138
00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:50.911
Thank you.

139
00:10:53.571 --> 00:10:56.073
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then you
also do have to put params down here,

140
00:10:56.073 --> 00:10:58.170
I forgot about that cuz
it's still an object.

141
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.381
So, with a comma.

142
00:11:07.602 --> 00:11:09.302
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, that should work now.

143
00:11:20.215 --> 00:11:24.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so let's see
what Linter errors I'm getting here.

144
00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:26.170
Nope, no Linter errors.

145
00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.670
Cool.

146
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.043
So let's see if I successfully
externalized all the state.

147
00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:38.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go to home,
I'll search for house, for the house.

148
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.330
Okay, so everything moved successfully.

149
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:41.783
I'll cut a branch here in just a second.

150
00:11:54.784 --> 00:11:59.184
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah,
looks like that's all working now.

151
00:11:59.184 --> 00:12:02.794
Is that working for some people?

152
00:12:02.794 --> 00:12:03.294
Cool.

153
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.400
So I will push a branch in just a second.

154
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:17.150
Scott is making an observation that
one might think about a binding show.

155
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.890
The reason why that we don't need
to is because I'm calling it here,

156
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.700
which every time I'm in render it's gonna
be guaranteed to be the right context.

157
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.800
So this is always gonna be correct.

158
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.031
So I actually don't need to
bind in this particular case.

159
00:12:30.031 --> 00:12:34.420
It's the callbacks for like on-change and
on-submit that you have to worry about.

160
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:35.800
Those are the ones that
are have to be bound.

161
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.464
So this one actually is okay as is.

162
00:12:40.644 --> 00:12:41.201
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

163
00:12:41.201 --> 00:12:45.250
we've successfully refactored to
move all of our shows into redux.

164
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.750
Any questions about that?

165
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:53.665
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Getting
an unexpected token with shows.

166
00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:55.692
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What line?

167
00:12:55.692 --> 00:12:58.092
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Line 35.

168
00:12:58.092 --> 00:13:00.257
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: On which?

169
00:13:00.257 --> 00:13:04.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It's in details.

170
00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.918
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Found it.

171
00:13:05.918 --> 00:13:06.418
Cool.

172
00:13:10.008 --> 00:13:11.268
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other questions?

173
00:13:11.268 --> 00:13:12.628
Make sense?

174
00:13:12.628 --> 00:13:15.705
I don't think any new concepts
are necessary explored here,

175
00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:18.320
it's just more applications,
more refactoring.

176
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:25.550
And again, I think it's good for you to
be able to see how you refactor react,

177
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:28.120
cuz half of our jobs is refactoring,
right?

178
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.840
That just happens a lot
when you're writing code.

179
00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.359
Okay, we broke another
one of our redux tests.

180
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.033
Now our initial state one is not
gonna be correct anymore, but

181
00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:39.868
hurray we're not gonna fix that right now.

182
00:13:39.868 --> 00:13:41.285
[LAUGH] Okay
