[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:07.410
&gt;&gt; Brian: I don't think any of this
should be really news to you in terms

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.890
of the react parts of it.

4
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.600
Hopefully as we're talking more and
more about breaking things in a component.

5
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.940
You're like I should break this into
component sensor should be going

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.450
off right now.

7
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.397
Cuz we have header in two
different places, right?

8
00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:23.840
What's annoying like say tomorrow that
marketing decides to pivot the brand and

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.672
they want to be called something else now.

10
00:00:25.672 --> 00:00:29.332
Now we have to go to every single header
that we have in all of our app and

11
00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:30.990
change in every single place.

12
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.130
That's really annoying, right?

13
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.550
It would be much better if we
could had one header component.

14
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.630
We changed it once and
now it worked everywhere.

15
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.701
&gt;&gt; Brian: Or whatever reason, say you
wanted to change the color of the header

16
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:47.570
to red, any one of those reasons
of why you wanted to do that.

17
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.620
So we can break header out
into its own component.

18
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.370
We can kind of decompose this
into smaller components and so

19
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.000
we can just include the header component
and we can also test it individually.

20
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.250
We can throw it on multiple pages.

21
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.880
It becomes much more testable and
reusable, all happy good feelings.

22
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.434
In fact,
I'm presently experience this in Netflix.

23
00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:11.280
We have seven different footers and so we
had to change our privacy policy link and

24
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.380
then I've had to fix it in seven places.

25
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.530
And I actually just got
an email this morning saying,

26
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
hey you forgot to fix it in yet
another footer.

27
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.396
So, not complaining, but yeah,
I'm complaining, that's terrible.

28
00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:26.417
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian: [LAUGH] Okay, so let's break out

29
00:01:26.417 --> 00:01:32.436
header into its own little component, and
then after that we'll take a little break.

30
00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:38.456
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
go create a new file called header.jsx.

31
00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:45.681
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and

32
00:01:45.681 --> 00:01:50.315
let's just knock this out really
quick const React = require react.

33
00:01:53.295 --> 00:01:55.377
&gt;&gt; Brian: const React, let's see,

34
00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:59.728
what we want is actually
Link out of 'react-router'.

35
00:02:05.388 --> 00:02:08.179
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then,
we wanna make a new, yeah,

36
00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.248
you can make this in whatever you want to.

37
00:02:11.248 --> 00:02:14.370
We can even make this a stateless
functional component.

38
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.330
Well no, make it a whatever,
whatever you wanna do.

39
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.970
I'll do a create class here.

40
00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.400
We're initially gonna make this stateless,
but

41
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.720
it's quickly going to be not be stateless.

42
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.631
So, just go ahead and
not make it a stateless component

43
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:44.435
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, and

44
00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:50.251
this is gonna be header
className='header'.

45
00:02:55.231 --> 00:03:01.731
&gt;&gt; Brian: And h1 className='brand'.

46
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.251
&gt;&gt; Brian: Here I wanna say svideo.

47
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:13.592
&gt;&gt; Brian: But we want to make this
little bit more useful, right?

48
00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:18.012
People expect when they click on
the branding to go to the homepage, right,

49
00:03:18.012 --> 00:03:21.137
that's just a general expectations of UI,
right?

50
00:03:21.137 --> 00:03:24.120
I if you're on netflix.com and
you click on the Netlix,

51
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.000
you expect just to go
to Netflix's homepage.

52
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.913
So, let's use Link to do that.

53
00:03:28.913 --> 00:03:34.013
Two sides to play nicely
with Internet expectations.

54
00:03:37.973 --> 00:03:40.272
&gt;&gt; Brian: Equals brand-link.

55
00:03:47.212 --> 00:03:48.852
&gt;&gt; Brian: And so
now we have a nice link in there as well.

56
00:03:52.712 --> 00:03:58.092
&gt;&gt; Brian: And down here we're
gonna say module.exports = Header.

57
00:04:07.493 --> 00:04:08.393
&gt;&gt; Brian: Questions about that?

58
00:04:19.693 --> 00:04:21.925
&gt;&gt; Brian: We'll go through
this on detail.jsx and

59
00:04:21.925 --> 00:04:26.808
then,
&gt;&gt; Brian: We'll do the Back button,

60
00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:28.193
and then we will break after that.

61
00:04:31.253 --> 00:04:37.314
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so go to Details.

62
00:04:37.314 --> 00:04:42.685
And instead of having this header
right here, let's go ahead and

63
00:04:42.685 --> 00:04:46.894
say const Header = require('./Header').

64
00:04:50.454 --> 00:04:52.574
&gt;&gt; Brian: And we're just gonna
throw Header on here like this.

65
00:04:57.074 --> 00:04:58.460
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, save that.

66
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.530
So, all I did was require this up here and
then use it right there.

67
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.820
That's it.

68
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.906
Then what we're gonna do is we're gonna
make sure that nothing's breaking,

69
00:05:11.906 --> 00:05:13.164
everything looks okay.

70
00:05:13.164 --> 00:05:16.680
So, let's come back here to details,

71
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.484
refresh the page so
that same header's still there.

72
00:05:21.484 --> 00:05:25.099
But now notice you can actually
click on the header and

73
00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.554
it's actually gonna take
you to the Homepage which

74
00:05:28.554 --> 00:05:32.920
is exactly what a user would
expect out of your program, right?

75
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.500
Something that one may ask me is why
don't we put this in the general layout,

76
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.550
right, because most pages would
expect to have it in the layout.

77
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.538
Well notice this page actually
doesn't have a header, right?

78
00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:45.310
It would be kind of weird if
there was a header or maybe not,

79
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.880
maybe you think that's a good idea.

80
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.939
And if that was the case,

81
00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:51.284
if it was literally on every page then
it should definitely go into the layout.

82
00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.564
But this page doesn't have on so
we are not gonna put it here.

83
00:05:57.265 --> 00:06:01.825
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,
let's put a back button up here as well so

84
00:06:01.825 --> 00:06:06.167
we can also navigate
back to details as well.

85
00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:07.647
So not details, back to search.

86
00:06:10.087 --> 00:06:13.187
&gt;&gt; Brian: So,
let's go to header again, header.jsx.

87
00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:23.808
&gt;&gt; Brian: And what we're gonna do here is
we're just gonna put a really simple back

88
00:06:23.808 --> 00:06:24.969
button really quick.

89
00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.948
So, after the h1, go ahead and do an h2,

90
00:06:31.068 --> 00:06:35.086
&gt;&gt; Brian: And 'header-back'.

91
00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:37.710
Then inside of here,
we're going to put a Link.

92
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.683
And this is just gonna go to /search.

93
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.350
&gt;&gt; Brian: Back.

94
00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:52.623
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's it.

95
00:06:52.623 --> 00:06:53.564
So we just added that.

96
00:06:58.945 --> 00:07:01.322
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There was a question
if you could create a route for

97
00:07:01.322 --> 00:07:04.550
the navbar that wraps all
the pages except for the index.

98
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.161
&gt;&gt; Brian: You definitely
could do nested routing, but

99
00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:11.113
not with our current URL structure.

100
00:07:11.113 --> 00:07:12.670
I'll navigate there just a second,

101
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.293
I just wanna make sure everyone
gets this h2 in there, okay?

102
00:07:15.293 --> 00:07:18.533
And I'll push a branch after this,
as well.

103
00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:23.860
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,
I think most people have ceased typing.

104
00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:26.600
So, let's go just chit-chat
a second about that.

105
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:32.390
Notice that these two don't actually share
a route, in the sense that they don't

106
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:37.460
share a URL structure,
like this IndexRoute doesn't already say.

107
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.910
Now, what you could do is
you can make route, sorry.

108
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.902
Search the component here, right?

109
00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:49.206
But let's just kind of do it,
we'll just kind of hack out [COUGH] for

110
00:07:49.206 --> 00:07:51.462
just a second, don't follow me here, but.

111
00:07:51.462 --> 00:07:54.162
And then we would have another
IndexRoute right here.

112
00:07:59.362 --> 00:08:07.710
&gt;&gt; Brian: With component = search.

113
00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.960
This would be some sort of like search
layout, right, and something like that.

114
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:18.730
But what actually ends up happening
here is this modifies our URL structure.

115
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:23.290
So, instead of going to details, you would
actually go to search/details, right?

116
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:30.480
If you're okay with that being you're
URL structure, then go right ahead, and

117
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.390
then you could make a common
layout between the two.

118
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.338
But this also seems to be a little
bit convoluted of nesting and

119
00:08:37.338 --> 00:08:41.135
it also messes with our URL structure so
we're not into that or

120
00:08:41.135 --> 00:08:43.562
I'm not into that, you can be into it.

121
00:08:43.562 --> 00:08:46.622
Anyway, that's why that's
not happening right now.

122
00:08:51.662 --> 00:08:54.102
&gt;&gt; Brian: Good question though.

123
00:08:54.102 --> 00:08:56.385
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How could you
refactor this to use history and

124
00:08:56.385 --> 00:08:59.102
take them back to the previous
page that they were on?

125
00:09:02.782 --> 00:09:08.791
&gt;&gt; Brian: The answer to that question
is you've come here to details.jsx,

126
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:10.303
details.jsx.

127
00:09:10.303 --> 00:09:14.343
Instead of using a link and
not detail, sorry header.

128
00:09:18.883 --> 00:09:22.603
&gt;&gt; Brian: And you would not make this a
link, you would make this and anchor tag.

129
00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:29.523
This would be an href,
&gt;&gt; Brian: And this would be a function,

130
00:09:29.523 --> 00:09:33.928
basically a function call that
would be getPreviousLink.

131
00:09:38.588 --> 00:09:41.589
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, then you write a function
up here called getPreviousLink.

132
00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:48.250
That would basically go grab
the history.back of whatever they were,

133
00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:50.893
and then you would put it down here.

134
00:09:50.893 --> 00:09:54.373
And then, every time it would call render,
it would go get that link and put it here.

135
00:09:56.394 --> 00:09:57.814
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's the basic
gist of what was happening.

136
00:09:57.814 --> 00:09:59.874
And then you'd have to have
some sort of fallback, right?

137
00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:03.722
Because maybe they directly
navigated to the page and

138
00:10:03.722 --> 00:10:08.434
you still want the Back button to work and
go somewhere expected.

139
00:10:11.574 --> 00:10:13.654
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's the jist that.

140
00:10:13.654 --> 00:10:17.684
In our case, because we can
kind of self-contained our app,

141
00:10:17.684 --> 00:10:22.894
we know that back is always going to be
the search page, so that tends to be okay.

142
00:10:30.055 --> 00:10:32.043
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,
I didn't even see if if this ran, so

143
00:10:32.043 --> 00:10:33.550
let's just make sure it works.

144
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.080
So now you have a Back button up here, and
you can click Back and it goes back and

145
00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.760
forth just fine.
