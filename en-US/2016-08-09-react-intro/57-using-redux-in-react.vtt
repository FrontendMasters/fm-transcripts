2
00:00:03.573 --> 00:00:10.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Can you explain the map
state to props in MAP dispatch to props?

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.090
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's actually go
use the connector, right?

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.119
This is making a special components
that's going to wrap our components.

5
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.090
Let's go use it, and if you still don't
understand it, let's talk about it

6
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.000
because I feel like it's really
abstract until we actually do it.

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.390
It's actually fairly, it's fairly well
like small in terms of what it does.

8
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.110
I hope that's enough hand waving for
you, and

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.610
if it still doesn't make sense after
we do it, let's talk about it.

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And any places that
we could be console logging to help

11
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.530
visualize some of this data flow?

12
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.481
&gt;&gt; Brian: You can certainly
do it in your reducer.

13
00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:53.720
&gt;&gt; Brian: Console.log(state,
action), right?

14
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.980
That would be the place to do it,
but we're going

15
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.890
to use redux tool momentarily and you can
you can introspect using redux tools.

16
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.950
Okay, so

17
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.329
let's go make this work right now it's
just a store doing absolutely nothing.

18
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.220
So, we have to go do some, basically
bootstrapping of this really quick.

19
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.036
Let's go to client app.jsx.

20
00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:25.530
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
we're gonna pull in store here.

21
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.160
So, up here we're going to pull in,
I'll just do a dent

22
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.140
here at the bottom Const Store
equals require, dot, slash store.

23
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.280
Const, actually what I wanted out of here

24
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.180
is, I just want to lower
case store really.

25
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.673
Remember that one that we just created,
we're just gonna pull that one out,

26
00:01:57.673 --> 00:02:03.454
and I'm gonna do const {provider}
equals require('react-redux')

27
00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:10.084
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're gonna use Provider

28
00:02:10.084 --> 00:02:10.718
here in just a sec.

29
00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:20.630
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, let's do this the easiest
way possible and will modify this later.

30
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.623
I like making sure that router is always
the root component of what I'm doing here,

31
00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:33.336
so I'm actually in a rap app down here in
the render part, I'm gonna say provider.

32
00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:42.615
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's just do it
out there not a big deal.

33
00:02:42.615 --> 00:02:46.380
JK, we're gonna do it right here.

34
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.528
Provider and
we're gonna say store equal store right?

35
00:02:54.746 --> 00:02:56.552
&gt;&gt; Brian: Down here just
indent this little bit, and

36
00:02:56.552 --> 00:02:59.270
then we're gonna /Provider right here,
so what is Provider?

37
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.760
Provider comes from react-redux
which we saw right here.

38
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.290
And what Provider is gonna do is
anytime you at you use the connector

39
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.710
it's going to automatically connect to
our redux store and pull in data for you.

40
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.299
But you have to give it
basically this top level so

41
00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.406
that it can be able to manipulate
whatever you're doing.

42
00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:21.437
&gt;&gt; Brian: So this is a little magical and

43
00:03:21.437 --> 00:03:26.410
I really don't like magic if you've
ever talk to me about programming.

44
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.530
But it's pretty easy to
understand how it works too.

45
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.030
So, yeah.

46
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.190
Provider.

47
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.260
That needs to be closed too.

48
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think there's an extra
angle bracket inside the curly

49
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.630
brace after store.

50
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.290
&gt;&gt; Brian: After store.

51
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.040
There it is.
Thank you.

52
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.800
Okay.
So Provider.

53
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.840
This is from reactor
redux it's gonna look for

54
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.760
your Redux store wherever it is, right?

55
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.540
And actually pass it in which is this,
right?

56
00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.460
So this is our actual Redux store and now
this is going to make this available to

57
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.770
anywhere you requested inside of your app,
right?

58
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.480
So any place that we use connector
It's going to find our Redux store and

59
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.320
plug it in, right?

60
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.500
So again a little magical but
you just have to know that

61
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.350
it's gonna be passing your store
to wherever you ask for it.

62
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.360
So this is nice because now you don't
have this like magical store floating in

63
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.550
the ether that sometimes you say, hey
store give me stuff You just gonna plug it

64
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.360
in just where it's needed and everything
else doesn't even get to see it.

65
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.990
Which is a good thing because then you
don't get bugs we don't expect them.

66
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.640
So it's explicit and being explicit
this particular case is useful, okay.

67
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.127
So this is just making it available
now it's actually go use it.

68
00:04:43.887 --> 00:04:53.481
&gt;&gt; Brian: So go into Header
&gt;&gt; Brian: Header.jsx.

69
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:55.250
And we're going to pull it in here.

70
00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.680
So I want to bring in, const { connector

71
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.338
} = require('./Store'}.

72
00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:09.740
This is the The connector
wrapper that we wrote.

73
00:05:14.011 --> 00:05:16.525
&gt;&gt; Brian: And the really easy way to
do this is when we're doing module

74
00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:17.590
that exports down here.

75
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.840
You can just do connector header.

76
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:27.750
This is going to wrap it with our,
our map state to props,

77
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.739
map to station, dispatch to props.

78
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.130
So basically we're saying like this.

79
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.920
Stop props here and now we can also
say that down here a console dialog

80
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.640
this stop props dot search turn right.

81
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.310
And this is now going to work not
coming from like any other state.

82
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.815
It's gonna come from,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Our store

83
00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:57.350
instead of coming from somewhere else and
react.

84
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.405
So this magically connected
us to a redux store.

85
00:06:06.696 --> 00:06:11.413
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so now all we have
to do here inside of header is

86
00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:16.680
we're gonna say this stuff
this.props.searchterm.

87
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:23.400
Yeah, instead we're going to have
to use the one that comes from.

88
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.660
We actually got to be called the same
thing in a search term change

89
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.920
sets search terms.

90
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.920
Right So now this isn't coming
from our parent this is actually

91
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.940
coming from redux right So
this is actually called Set search term.

92
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.790
Right.
That's what we called it.

93
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.210
So it's going to set search term.

94
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.330
And that matches up to.

95
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.180
The function from store.

96
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.740
So let's just look over at store.

97
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.570
This matches up to this
function right here, right.

98
00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.210
That's, that's the function we're calling.

99
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:56.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Which by the way needs
an arrow between the argument,

100
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.910
and the curly bracket.

101
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:05.169
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah you can do it that way to,
this or, this also works.

102
00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:06.078
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I got an error.

103
00:07:10.278 --> 00:07:11.358
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

104
00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:15.200
And that should work but that also works.

105
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.164
Same diff, but I believe

106
00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:27.955
Okay so going back to header
which is where we were so

107
00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:30.545
you understand where that
method is that we're calling.

108
00:07:30.545 --> 00:07:34.250
It's coming from store And
now that we've called connector and

109
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.010
wrapped header, these things are being
injected into the properties.

110
00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:41.900
That's what connector does is it grabs
these methods in the state that we want

111
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.440
and it injects that into our
reacts component from redux.

112
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.559
So it's the connector,
it's the glue between redux and react.

113
00:07:53.859 --> 00:07:55.325
&gt;&gt; Brian: By the way,
if you're following my notes,

114
00:07:55.325 --> 00:07:56.879
I'm a little off the beaten path,
by the way.

115
00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:04.020
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, this all should work
I think the way that I have it here.

116
00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.090
This needs to be setSearchTerm right here.

117
00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.339
And I think after that we're all good.

118
00:08:17.418 --> 00:08:18.258
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

119
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:24.343
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, save that,
let's see if everything's working okay.

120
00:08:24.343 --> 00:08:30.371
I have one error in store,
infix operators must be spaced, okay.

121
00:08:30.371 --> 00:08:35.251
Line 9, store.

122
00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:43.441
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Brian: Is that what this was?

123
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:44.501
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

124
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:46.340
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, cool.

125
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:53.030
Yeah I guess that would
be an fix OPERATOR OK so

126
00:08:54.460 --> 00:09:00.650
yeah go over to your app real quick and
refresh go to browse all.

127
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:05.440
OK so now in your header here we should
be able to type and now not We anticipate

128
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:08.290
that we broke the search right because
we're no longer pulling in that state.

129
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.280
So we're no longer using the correct
state, we're not using the state

130
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:16.900
from redux, we're still depending
on it being there from react.

131
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.210
Right?
So now we have to go change that.

132
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:25.339
So in other words,
this is intended behavior so

133
00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:29.270
far Let's take a second.

134
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.350
Does anyone have questions.

135
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.940
We're kind of halfway through this so
if some of this doesn't make sense,

136
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.430
let's maybe get a little
bit closer to the end.

137
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:39.010
And connect all the dots because I'm like
half way around the circle it's like,

138
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.130
hey these two dots don't connect.

139
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.070
And it's like, okay well,
we haven't actually connected them yet so.

140
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Somebody
wanted to see quickly where

141
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.101
you were creating a store again?

142
00:09:48.101 --> 00:09:48.601
&gt;&gt; Brian: Sure.

143
00:09:56.691 --> 00:10:00.878
&gt;&gt; Brian: Davide is saying that he's
getting an error that cannot see read,

144
00:10:00.878 --> 00:10:01.860
create store.

145
00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.700
So you have to do require redux up there.

146
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:06.810
That's the only reason I can.

147
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:08.810
Think of why you would see that.

148
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.240
So const redux equals require redux make
sure that's spelled correctly as well,

149
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:18.010
as well as down here,
redux dot createStore.
