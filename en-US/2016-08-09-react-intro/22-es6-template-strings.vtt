[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.232
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's not,
I mean it's cute, right?

3
00:00:05.232 --> 00:00:05.931
Like we're showing titles.

4
00:00:05.931 --> 00:00:09.590
But that's not necessarily
what we're going for.

5
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.398
So let's make this a little bit more
robust and show more things here.

6
00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:18.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's do this.

7
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.643
I'm going to say div className='show'.

8
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:30.300
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Outside of that
we're going to put an image.

9
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.226
Source of the image equals S.

10
00:00:33.226 --> 00:00:36.354
We're going to do curly braces.

11
00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:40.872
And then I'm going to back ticks, okay.

12
00:00:40.872 --> 00:00:42.109
Which back ticks,
if you don't know what those are.

13
00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.584
It's next to the one underneath the tilde.

14
00:00:45.584 --> 00:00:52.274
And a back tick in ES 6 means,
ES 6 template string, right.

15
00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:54.213
So let me write it out first.

16
00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:59.217
And I will show you how you

17
00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:04.939
could rewrite it into ES5.

18
00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.742
Show.poster and class name

19
00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:14.540
equals show-ing close.

20
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.040
Okay.

21
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.020
So basically what this is saying
is like this is a string, right?

22
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.000
And so instead of using quotes,
I'm using back ticks.

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.580
But now I can use the special
terminology of dollar sign curly brace.

24
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.760
Which if you've ever written bash scripts
before, that looks pretty familiar, right.

25
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.390
And then this inside of here
is a JavaScript expression.

26
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.410
So in this particular case
I'm doing show.poster.

27
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.080
Which is actually going to be the correct
URL to find this particular image.

28
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.070
Now if I wanted to rewrite this in ES5,

29
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.688
what I would do is I'd turn
this into single quotes.

30
00:01:46.688 --> 00:01:51.810
Single quotes.

31
00:01:54.953 --> 00:01:59.370
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I would say plus show poster.

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.730
Right.

33
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.000
That's the equivalent way of
doing it without back ticks.

34
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.549
Just doing string concatenation,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

35
00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.490
I think this is a lot cleaner and
prettier side.

36
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.350
I like doing it that way.

37
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.430
Any questions about ES6 templates?

38
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.930
Come on.

39
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.690
There we go.

40
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.500
Good?
Feel good about that?

41
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.000
Okay.

42
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.990
I got really sick of doing
plus signs everywhere.

43
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.640
So that's why I was very grateful for
the back ticks.

44
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.660
Okay.
&lt;div classname="show-text"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

45
00:02:48.588 --> 00:02:51.200
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here we're going to do H3

46
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.560
class name equals show-title.

47
00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.514
And then we're going to do show.title.

48
00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:06.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're
going to do an H4 here.

49
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.400
class name equals show-year.

50
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.030
And then here, I want to do parentheses.

51
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.570
The reason why I'm doing parentheses
is actually literally want to see

52
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.780
parentheses, right?

53
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.580
There is no special meaning
to these parentheses.

54
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.100
I literally want to see
the the year in parentheses.

55
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.662
Then we do show.year instead
of the curly braces.

56
00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:40.107
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here i'm going
to do p className=show-description.

57
00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:47.342
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm going to do show.description.

58
00:03:50.418 --> 00:03:52.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inside of that p tag.

59
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.570
Okay.

60
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A bunch of mark up,
but hopefully you got it.

61
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.855
Let's give you some time
to finish typing that out.

62
00:04:09.855 --> 00:04:13.772
Might finish this section,

63
00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:19.490
take a really brief big break for people.

64
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.465
Okay there will be a break soon.

65
00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:29.250
If anyone's feeling like their mind
melting or something like that.

66
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.265
Okay.
So let's save that,

67
00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:34.710
make sure that I'm not
getting linting errors.

68
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.130
Look like I'm okay right now.

69
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.888
So let's go back over to the browser and
refresh it.

70
00:04:39.888 --> 00:04:44.420
And that's whatI did.

71
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.080
I did something wrong.

72
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.880
You should be saving
something kind of this.

73
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880
This is kind of ugly right now.

74
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.310
Particularly with these huge posters.

75
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.920
And that's because I forgot
to encapsulate into shows.

76
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.570
Yeah, that's exactly why.

77
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.907
Okay, so come back over here.

78
00:04:59.907 --> 00:05:03.534
And between container and
the data.shows.map.

79
00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:06.988
We're going to put just
an extra div in here.

80
00:05:06.988 --> 00:05:08.370
And call it shows.

81
00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.355
Indent all that a little bit more.

82
00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:15.869
And close that.

83
00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:19.850
Okay so this one right here, line 6.

84
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.970
And this one down here on line 17.

85
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.715
That's all you need to put in to
make the sales stop being so ugly.

86
00:05:26.715 --> 00:05:32.210
[LAUGH]
Okay.

87
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.134
So save that.

88
00:05:38.758 --> 00:05:43.930
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now if we refresh it,
it's only slightly better.

89
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.965
What did I do wrong here?

90
00:05:44.965 --> 00:05:50.135
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Show-card.

91
00:05:50.135 --> 00:05:51.778
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's what it is.

92
00:05:51.778 --> 00:05:55.685
Show-card right here.

93
00:05:55.685 --> 00:05:56.480
Yep, my notes are wrong.

94
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:01.730
Okay.

95
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.460
So here on line eight, I just
changed this from show to show card.

96
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.310
Okay.

97
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.260
Getting better, only slightly worse.

98
00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.580
Did I change all these to be show card?

99
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.300
It eventually does get better.

100
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.115
I think I called all these show card dash.

101
00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:33.596
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But
in the styling it's all wrapped in the 8.

102
00:06:33.596 --> 00:06:34.638
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's all wrapped in the 8.

103
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:41.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think my issue here is.

104
00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:49.062
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, everything in
the show card image, show card text,

105
00:06:49.062 --> 00:06:49.996
show card title.

106
00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:51.255
Yeah.

107
00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:57.309
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so show-card-image.

108
00:06:57.309 --> 00:07:00.664
Show-card-text.

109
00:07:00.664 --> 00:07:04.229
Show-card-title.

110
00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.452
Show-card-year.

111
00:07:07.452 --> 00:07:12.830
And Show-card-description.

112
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.932
So you have to update.

113
00:07:14.932 --> 00:07:20.292
Basically, all these classes
to have show-card-whatever.

114
00:07:22.871 --> 00:07:26.186
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay let's try that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

115
00:07:26.186 --> 00:07:28.440
now we actually get decent
looking things right.

116
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.640
That's what we were going for.

117
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.750
So I have a bunch of scroll bars,
that's neat.

118
00:07:37.513 --> 00:07:40.018
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah I'll
fix that in a bit.

119
00:07:40.018 --> 00:07:40.882
Well whatever, it's CSS.

120
00:07:40.882 --> 00:07:43.610
No one cares how CSS is in this workshop.

121
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.760
I don't care about it in this workshop.

122
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.240
I think I have some sort of like
overflow visible or something like that.

123
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.790
It's hard to see.

124
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:56.370
Or.

125
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.330
That's exactly what it is.

126
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.590
So, if you want to go get
rid of that in the CSS.

127
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.850
There is an overflow, scroll Y on the text
and you can get rid of that if you want.
