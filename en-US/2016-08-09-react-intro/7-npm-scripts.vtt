[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.454
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we're going to do MPM
scripts, so open your package.JSON, and

3
00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:11.206
I have all these in here, so
I'm going to quickly delete all of them so

4
00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:15.690
you don't see them.an Just kidding,
whatever you can see it's fine.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone asked if there's
a way to put standard in sublime text so

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.860
that every time you save
the file it does it for you?

7
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.580
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is,
I don't know how or

8
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.440
like at an off the top my head, but it's
should be pretty easy for you to set up.

9
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.677
I imagine the if I hit Shift+Control

10
00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:37.804
package install
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

11
00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.150
they say like standard format.

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.150
Yeah, we could put that on.

13
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.350
I choose not to because at Netflix if I
tried to take out semi-colons there would

14
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.480
be all out war ending in someone
getting fired and or dead.

15
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.140
So, I choose not to because

16
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.500
I have to switch back between personal
products and my Netflix work weird.

17
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.810
So, yeah, you can use standard format, and
I think it will actually do it'll tell

18
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.080
you in the gutter, if you're like,
you can see here where I have like

19
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070
these little markings right here,
that's my get gutter.

20
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.470
That's tell me things that I that's
changed since I last committed.

21
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.730
it will give you the same sort of errors
like hey you have a linting error on this

22
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.540
line which is pretty nice too.

23
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.710
Okay, good questions, though, so
let's talk about MPM scripts.

24
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.630
So anyone that's been working in
the JavaScript community a while has used

25
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.800
something like Gulp, or Grunt, or

26
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.900
Broccoli or ten thousand others that
I'm not going to think of right now.

27
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.760
Most of us have used at least Gulp or
Grunt.

28
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.240
Those tend to be the two bigger ones.

29
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.080
They are awesome tools, particularly
when you start having really big,

30
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.100
really complicated builds.

31
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
In our particular case we
have a pretty simple build.

32
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.580
So what we're going to do is we're
going to be using what's called ten

33
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.290
pm scripts which are basically bash
commands that we're going to pipe into.

34
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.550
Bashers Issus H, or whatever.

35
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.350
Anyway, the things that you pipe into

36
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.770
the command line that basically
wrote your scripts for you.

37
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.810
It's like a runs or build roads or
tests or and all that kind of stuff, so

38
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.660
let's do it now we're
going to call it test and

39
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.810
then over here you just
put whatever you want run.

40
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.200
So, in our particular case,
we want it to just run standard.

41
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.620
Now that seems like they're
not super compelling

42
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.870
reason to use this because how hard
is it to remember a standard But

43
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.770
once we have like ten different
things that we need to be able to do.

44
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.030
They end up being like having
like ten feature flags and

45
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.260
we're running three different
scripts at once, right.

46
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.350
Like, this gets to be really
useful because you no longer have

47
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.670
to have this like.

48
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.280
You no longer have to remember
what you have to type in.

49
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.080
That you can just remember, I just
need to write npm test and it's done.

50
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.907
Yeah, we put the scripts here, and we did
a test, and we put standard there, right?

51
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:11.619
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so
put that in, save it.

52
00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:15.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now come over to your command line.

53
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.400
So instead of running standard, we can
do npm run, and then, so you do npm run,

54
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.980
and that's letting npm know I want
you to run one of my scripts for me.

55
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.220
So anything you put in here,
I could put blah, right?

56
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.600
If I said MP.run blah,
it's going to run standard for me, right?

57
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.160
We choose

58
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.820
The node community that if you run npm run
test it's gonna run your tests for you.

59
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.910
To the point that they've actually
written some shortcuts for it.

60
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.530
So if we put test here instead,
Like I said, you can do npm run test, but

61
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.220
there's a handful of special scripts that
I can actually just run without test.

62
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.460
So if I say mpm test it will work.

63
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.830
And it actually even mpmt works.

64
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.610
But just know like I can't
change this to blah and

65
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.300
say mpm blah that's not
going to work right.

66
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.210
So tests is a special one.

67
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.000
Start is another one that is special.

68
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.200
theres other ones like pre-publish and

69
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.680
published, but
we're not to worry about those.

70
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.800
The two that you should worry
about are test and start.

71
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.225
So yeah, I wanna to put this to test.

72
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:49.046
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

73
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We're getting
errors when we run that.

74
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well I fixed mine but-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Are you getting errors when

75
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.360
you run-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was just missing a comma.

76
00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.270
So it's something with your.

77
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm just getting an error.

78
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.420
Nevermind.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

79
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.330
Anyone else getting the errors?

80
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.920
What's your error say?

81
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's so weird.

82
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.830
Missing script?

83
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:14.660
Missing script block.

84
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.592
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just come
into your package.json.

85
00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:21.890
Make sure this is

86
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.725
called scripts Yeah,

87
00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:32.040
better, cool.

88
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.050
Do you find your error back there?

89
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:35.560
Okay.

90
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: There's a question here from
Chad, is it common to use NPM to install

91
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.966
packages locally instead of
having to install them globally

92
00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:45.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: for example web pack.

93
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.250
It's very common to have them locally and
the best reason for that is that you can

94
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.960
pin the version because maybe you're on
like I'm on web pack 1.12 and they're

95
00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.280
about to release web pack 2 sometime in
the near slash distant future, who knows.

96
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.140
And now I can pin it to that version.

97
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.740
It's definitely itâ€™s
gonna be that version.

98
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.360
And I don't have to worry about people
getting the wrong dependency version.

99
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.080
Good question.

100
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Another question was when
you run this is it running locally or

101
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.740
globally, the standard?

102
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: it's going to try and
do it locally first.

103
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.140
MPM's pretty smart about that.

104
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.820
In fact, the later versions of.

105
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.010
We can actually even
just uninstall standard.

106
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.210
Just, you don't have to do this.

107
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.130
I'm just gonna show you.

108
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.440
So I'm gonna unbuild it.

109
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.410
So now if I try and run standard,
it's gonna say, hey what the hell?

110
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.040
But if I still do npm tests
It's going to err, that's nice.

111
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.610
Do I have it?

112
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.056
I don't pry to have it as a dependency.

113
00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:54.412
So, npm install

114
00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:58.960
standard.

115
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.350
So I'm now Jeez, what am I doing here?

116
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.780
403 forbidden.

117
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.080
Sorry I have to switch registries.

118
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.730
Use default.

119
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.871
Okay let's try that again.

120
00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:26.131
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway this is all an
elaborate way to show you that I'm calling

121
00:07:26.131 --> 00:07:30.206
standard as if I knew it was going
to be on the command line but

122
00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:34.038
MPM is actually gonna be smart
enough to look locally for

123
00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:39.174
that standard package before it looks
like for a global version of it Okay so

124
00:07:39.174 --> 00:07:44.690
now if I say npm test it actually does
find that correct standard binary it is.

125
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.999
Despite the fact that if I type standard.

126
00:07:48.992 --> 00:07:49.774
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not available

127
00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:52.870
globally I don't know I think
it's a really cool feature.

128
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.850
So I can still write my bashcommand the
same way I don't have to do something dumb

129
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.821
like Dot slash, node slash.

130
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:04.441
Modules anyway.

131
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:07.510
Neat feature.

132
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.870
Okay any other questions.

133
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:13.076
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: There was,
can you run multiple modules in that test?

134
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:14.811
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Multiple modules?

135
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:17.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Multiple modules.

136
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Meaning I say like and
and mocha, right?

137
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is that the idea?

138
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.700
The answer's yes, and
we'll do it here actually shortly.

139
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.222
We just have nothing
else to run right now.

140
00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:28.367
[LAUGH]
