[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.454
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we're going to do MPM
scripts, so open your package.JSON, and

3
00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:11.206
I have all these in here, so
I'm going to quickly delete all of them so

4
00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:13.950
you don't see them.an Just kidding,

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.720
whatever you can see it's fine.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone asked if there's

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.990
a way to put standard in sublime text so
that every time you save the file it

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.470
does it for you?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is,

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.850
I don't know how or
like at an off the top my head, but

9
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.440
it's should be pretty easy for
you to set up.

10
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.677
I imagine the if I hit Shift+Control

11
00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:37.804
package install
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

12
00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.150
they say like standard format.

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.150
Yeah, we could put that on.

14
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.350
I choose not to because at Netflix if I
tried to take out semi-colons there would

15
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.480
be all out war ending in someone
getting fired and or dead.

16
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.140
So, I choose not to because

17
00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.500
I have to switch back between personal
products and my Netflix work weird.

18
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.810
So, yeah, you can use standard format, and
I think it will actually do it'll tell

19
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.080
you in the gutter, if you're like,
you can see here where I have like

20
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070
these little markings right here,
that's my get gutter.

21
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.470
That's tell me things that I that's
changed since I last committed.

22
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.730
it will give you the same sort of errors
like hey you have a linting error on this

23
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.540
line which is pretty nice too.

24
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.710
Okay, good questions, though, so
let's talk about MPM scripts.

25
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.630
So anyone that's been working in
the JavaScript community a while has used

26
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.800
something like Gulp, or Grunt, or

27
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.900
Broccoli or ten thousand others that
I'm not going to think of right now.

28
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.760
Most of us have used at least Gulp or
Grunt.

29
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.240
Those tend to be the two bigger ones.

30
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.080
They are awesome tools, particularly
when you start having really big,

31
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.100
really complicated builds.

32
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.100
In our particular case we
have a pretty simple build.

33
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.580
So what we're going to do is we're
going to be using what's called ten

34
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.290
pm scripts which are basically bash
commands that we're going to pipe into.

35
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.550
Bashers Issus H, or whatever.

36
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.350
Anyway, the things that you pipe into

37
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.770
the command line that basically
wrote your scripts for you.

38
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.810
It's like a runs or build roads or
tests or and all that kind of stuff, so

39
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.660
let's do it now we're
going to call it test and

40
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.810
then over here you just
put whatever you want run.

41
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.200
So, in our particular case,
we want it to just run standard.

42
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.620
Now that seems like they're
not super compelling

43
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.870
reason to use this because how hard
is it to remember a standard But

44
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.770
once we have like ten different
things that we need to be able to do.

45
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.030
They end up being like having
like ten feature flags and

46
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.260
we're running three different
scripts at once, right.

47
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.350
Like, this gets to be really
useful because you no longer have

48
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.670
to have this like.

49
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.280
You no longer have to remember
what you have to type in.

50
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.080
That you can just remember, I just
need to write npm test and it's done.

51
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.497
Yeah, we put the scripts here, and
we did a test, and we put standard there,

52
00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:10.891
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so put that in,

53
00:03:10.891 --> 00:03:13.502
save it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

54
00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:15.180
now come over to your command line.

55
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.400
So instead of running standard, we can
do npm run, and then, so you do npm run,

56
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.980
and that's letting npm know I want
you to run one of my scripts for me.

57
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.220
So anything you put in here,
I could put blah, right?

58
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.600
If I said MP.run blah,
it's going to run standard for me, right?

59
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.160
We choose

60
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.820
The node community that if you run npm run
test it's gonna run your tests for you.

61
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.910
To the point that they've actually
written some shortcuts for it.

62
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.530
So if we put test here instead,
Like I said, you can do npm run test, but

63
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.220
there's a handful of special scripts that
I can actually just run without test.

64
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.460
So if I say mpm test it will work.

65
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.830
And it actually even mpmt works.

66
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.610
But just know like I can't
change this to blah and

67
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.300
say mpm blah that's not
going to work right.

68
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.210
So tests is a special one.

69
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.000
Start is another one that is special.

70
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.200
theres other ones like pre-publish and

71
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.680
published, but
we're not to worry about those.

72
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.800
The two that you should worry
about are test and start.

73
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.225
So yeah, I wanna to put this to test.

74
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:52.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We're

75
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.740
getting errors when we run that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well I fixed mine but-

76
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.950
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Are you getting errors when

77
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.360
you run-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was just missing a comma.

78
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.840
So it's something with your.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm just getting an error.

79
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:02.420
Nevermind.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

80
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.330
Anyone else getting the errors?

81
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.270
What's your error say?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It's so weird.

82
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.830
Missing script?

83
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.625
Missing script block.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just come into your

84
00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:17.592
package.json.

85
00:05:17.592 --> 00:05:21.890
Make sure this is

86
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.725
called scripts Yeah,

87
00:05:27.725 --> 00:05:32.040
better, cool.

88
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.050
Do you find your error back there?

89
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.720
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: There's a question here from

90
00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.850
Chad, is it common to use NPM to install
packages locally instead of having

91
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.860
to install them globally
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: for example web pack.

92
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.250
It's very common to have them locally and
the best reason for that is that you can

93
00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.960
pin the version because maybe you're on
like I'm on web pack 1.12 and they're

94
00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.280
about to release web pack 2 sometime in
the near slash distant future, who knows.

95
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.140
And now I can pin it to that version.

96
00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.740
It's definitely itâ€™s
gonna be that version.

97
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.360
And I don't have to worry about people
getting the wrong dependency version.

98
00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.900
Good question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Another question was

99
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.330
when you run this is it running locally or

100
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:18.440
globally, the standard?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: it's going to try and

101
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.540
do it locally first.

102
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.140
MPM's pretty smart about that.

103
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.820
In fact, the later versions of.

104
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:30.010
We can actually even
just uninstall standard.

105
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.210
Just, you don't have to do this.

106
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.130
I'm just gonna show you.

107
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.440
So I'm gonna unbuild it.

108
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.410
So now if I try and run standard,
it's gonna say, hey what the hell?

109
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:46.040
But if I still do npm tests
It's going to err, that's nice.

110
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.610
Do I have it?

111
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.056
I don't pry to have it as a dependency.

112
00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:54.412
So, npm install

113
00:06:54.412 --> 00:06:58.960
standard.

114
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.350
So I'm now Jeez, what am I doing here?

115
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.780
403 forbidden.

116
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:10.080
Sorry I have to switch registries.

117
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.730
Use default.

118
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:22.301
Okay let's try that again.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway

119
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:27.191
this is all an elaborate way to show
you that I'm calling standard as if I

120
00:07:27.191 --> 00:07:30.206
knew it was going to be
on the command line but

121
00:07:30.206 --> 00:07:34.038
MPM is actually gonna be smart
enough to look locally for

122
00:07:34.038 --> 00:07:39.174
that standard package before it looks
like for a global version of it Okay so

123
00:07:39.174 --> 00:07:44.690
now if I say npm test it actually does
find that correct standard binary it is.

124
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:49.360
Despite the fact that if I type standard.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not

125
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.870
available globally I don't know I
think it's a really cool feature.

126
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:55.850
So I can still write my bashcommand the
same way I don't have to do something dumb

127
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.821
like Dot slash, node slash.

128
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:04.441
Modules anyway.

129
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:07.510
Neat feature.

130
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.730
Okay any other questions.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: There was,

131
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.811
can you run multiple modules in that test?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Multiple modules?

132
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:17.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Multiple modules.

133
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.240
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Meaning I say like and

134
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.380
and mocha, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

135
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:21.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is that the idea?

136
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.700
The answer's yes, and
we'll do it here actually shortly.

137
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.222
We just have nothing
else to run right now.

138
00:08:27.222 --> 00:08:28.367
[LAUGH]
