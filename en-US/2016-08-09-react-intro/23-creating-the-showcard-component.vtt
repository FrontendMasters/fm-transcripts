00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.902
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.902 --> 00:00:05.504
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
let's reorganize this little bit.

3
00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:10.490
So some weird codes really should be
getting from this right now is we have

4
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.725
this outer search page, but then we
have this interior thing right here,

5
00:00:15.725 --> 00:00:19.035
this is kind of like weird, right?

6
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.524
This really should be a separate
component, right, cuz it's,

7
00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:27.635
I don't know, we have multiple concerns
here and that should feel weird to you.

8
00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:34.648
So what we're gonna do is we're
actually going to create another file,

9
00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:37.655
call it ShowCard.jsx inside of JS.

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.790
Okay and then we're gonna come over here
to search and we're just gonna rip out

11
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.650
the middle part here to ShowCard.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

12
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.518
we're bringing in const React

13
00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:57.451
equals require react and

14
00:00:57.451 --> 00:01:02.320
here const ShowCard equals and

15
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.750
here we're going to use props with

16
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.807
our status component just paste

17
00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:17.862
all that stuff that we got from,

18
00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:21.440
from search, right?

19
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.430
I just copied and
pasted everything that was here into here.

20
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.730
But now it's not called show any more.

21
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.220
They're coming in via props, right?

22
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.900
So what we need to do is we need to
put props in front of all of these.

23
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.971
So we're gonna say props dot,
right props dot show dot

24
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.390
poster props that show the title props
that show that year and props that show

25
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.855
that description right cuz those are going
to be passed in to us via props.

26
00:01:49.855 --> 00:01:58.271
Any questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

27
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:02.401
then we also have to export
down here the bottom,

28
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:08.533
module.exports = ShowCard.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay so

29
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.930
now we're assuming these props
are gonna come down to us.

30
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.820
Now we actually have to make sure that
those props actually do eventually get

31
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.840
passed down to us.

32
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.692
So let's go do that in search.

33
00:02:17.692 --> 00:02:19.689
Does anyone have any questions
about ShowCard before I jump off?

34
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.540
Give me a sec to see if
people are catching up.

35
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.010
Okay, so come here.

36
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.102
First thing we're going
to do is we're going to

37
00:02:42.102 --> 00:02:47.959
pull in a ShowCard, ./ShowCard
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

38
00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.691
then we can just delete everything
in here and we're gonna say,

39
00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.698
&gt;&gt; Brian: First of all your linter's gonna

40
00:03:00.698 --> 00:03:05.074
start yelling at you here momentarily,

41
00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:12.030
we'll fix that too,
ShowCard show equals show, right.

42
00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.430
So show, this show,
the green show in this particular case

43
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.220
that's the name of the property
we're passing it down as and

44
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.220
then this show right here
refers to this one right here.

45
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.970
So if you want to, I don't know,
you can call it S or

46
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.060
whatever right, just to demonstrate
to you that they're different right.

47
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.760
This is whatever you're passing down.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay?

48
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.490
So this is a little bit better
abstraction that we have going here.

49
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.790
So save that.

50
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.350
And now we get a bunch of linting errors,
ignore them for

51
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.910
the moment we will take
care of them momentarily.

52
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.386
But yeah props validation problems.
&gt;&gt; Brian: But

53
00:04:03.386 --> 00:04:07.936
right now this should still work.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

54
00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:12.434
everything still works despite the fact
that we still get this key error but we're

55
00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:18.303
gonna fix that here in a sec as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Any

56
00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:22.762
questions about what's going on so far?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

57
00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.576
after you saved and
it showed all the linting errors,

58
00:04:26.576 --> 00:04:31.830
is it still recompiled and the file in
the browser is the updated version,

59
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.150
it didn't stop.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Correct.

60
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.920
So lint is not gonna stop your build,
it's just going to yell at you.

61
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.210
I believe you actually can
make lint stop your build.

62
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.740
Choose not to because oftentimes I want to
test something and I don't wanna make it

63
00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.270
lint complaint, I just want to throw it
on the page and make it do something.

64
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.496
Hence, like sometimes I just
know that I know I have

65
00:04:56.496 --> 00:05:00.440
linting errors but I'll fix them later.

66
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.170
But that's a great question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Your question is

67
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.420
why does the attribute called show?

68
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.640
What dictates that?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Me.

69
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.170
It's whatever I want to call it.

70
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.960
I can call it that if
you can pronounce it.

71
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.330
You just have to refer to it as such,

72
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.777
right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's where you reference

73
00:05:16.777 --> 00:05:18.273
in ShowCard when
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

74
00:05:18.273 --> 00:05:19.281
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: props dot.

75
00:05:19.281 --> 00:05:20.742
&gt;&gt; Brian: Props.show right,

76
00:05:20.742 --> 00:05:25.630
those two correspond to each other.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And then somebody else

77
00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.610
asked wouldn't it be better to pass
individual properties such as title, year,

78
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.994
description?
&gt;&gt; Brian: It can be.

79
00:05:31.994 --> 00:05:32.780
It's up to you and

80
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.900
I'm actually gonna show you an easy
way to kind of do that, momentarily.

81
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.688
Actually it's literally the next
thing I'm gonna show you.

82
00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:45.289
[LAUGH] Is that the next
thing I'm gonna show you?

83
00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:51.228
That's pretty close.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I have a quick question.

84
00:05:51.228 --> 00:05:52.380
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

85
00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.776
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Is there anything passed in

86
00:05:54.776 --> 00:06:01.010
the props object,
that you're not passing in explicitly?

87
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:06.950
Like are there other attributes on that?
&gt;&gt; Brian: If you look

88
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.029
at the props of different routes,
for, not ShowCard but like search,

89
00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.640
react router passes in a bunch of stuff
that you would might not be expecting.

90
00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.160
But in terms of like from search
to ShowCard, it literally,

91
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.990
I believe will just be show
in this particular case.

92
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.520
I don't think there's
anything else special.

93
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.250
So, that actually brings up a kind of an
interesting point like something you might

94
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.310
be wanting at some point is
like what's my parent, right.

95
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.160
That's something that people will
find themselves asking in react and

96
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.930
it's the wrong question to ask, right,

97
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.590
it's actually the question that react
deliberately avoids answering for you.

98
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.930
You'll hear something with react that
will make more sense when we talk

99
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:55.799
about Redux but,
it's props down actions up.

100
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.030
The basic gist of and probably the most
important concept that react presents to

101
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.110
the world is not really invented by react
but it certainly was popularized in

102
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.210
the front end world by react,
is that there is one way data flow, right.

103
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.380
So I have a parent that has data, right,
and the parent passes data down to

104
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.730
the child, right, and then that child
passes more data down to its child but

105
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:25.110
they have no concept of data going
up it's only data going down, right.

106
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.470
So what's really, really wonderful is
that if this parent is having a bug

107
00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.620
none of it's children could have caused it
because the children can't actually affect

108
00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.750
the parent right only the parent
can affect the children, right.

109
00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.189
So it basically is limiting
your surface of bugs, right.

110
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:44.460
And that's kinda of the,
as I've gotten more and

111
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.980
more experience with programming that's
something that I found that's like

112
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.940
the more and more I restrict my
capabilities and abilities in programming

113
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.980
that also means that I'm restricting my
surface that I can get bugs on, right.

114
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.416
Because if I can make
assumptions about my codes,

115
00:07:57.416 --> 00:08:01.012
I know nothing changed in this function,
thus I know that my state problem

116
00:08:01.012 --> 00:08:03.512
over here was not caused by this function,
right?

117
00:08:03.512 --> 00:08:08.790
And that's what react aims to do
with these props down actions up.

118
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.950
We'll talk about actions up
in here in a little bit, but

119
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:14.590
basically when the children
wants to modify it's parent or

120
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.410
it basically says hey parent this
happened, you take care of it, right?

121
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:24.100
So basically the child just lets
the parent know I have an event,

122
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.890
now it's your problem to deal with it.

123
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:33.300
That's the actions up philosophy.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So the nice

124
00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:38.360
thing about that is there is no hard
dependency between ShowCard and search.

125
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:43.560
So for example if we had a details page
which actually we will momentarily have

126
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.480
a details page and we want to use these
little ShowCards on the details page as

127
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.770
like, here are some related shows to
the show that you're currently watching,

128
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.920
we can just throw in ShowCards, right?

129
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.440
We don't even have to modify
anything like that because

130
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.741
this would fit really nicely at
the bottom of a page, right.

131
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:05.150
Magical,right, it's now making
our components reusable.

132
00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.160
So this approach of actions down,
sorry, actions up and

133
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.150
props down definitely does take some
retraining of your user interface brain.

134
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.630
I would suggest that I
have found it worth it and

135
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.910
that you would find it worth it as well.

136
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.700
It makes the bugging so much easier.
