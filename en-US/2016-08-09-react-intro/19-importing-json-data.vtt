WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.933
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:09.766
&gt;&gt; Brian: So now that we have React Router
actually loading our second page,

3
00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:13.213
our first page will make a second page.

4
00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:17.603
One thing is, we're going to start
referring to this dated JSON right here,

5
00:00:17.603 --> 00:00:21.193
and as you can see it's just
a bunch of Netflix Original shows.

6
00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:24.873
The other thing I should have mentioned is
that this is actually just an elaborate

7
00:00:24.873 --> 00:00:26.238
advertisement for Netflix.

8
00:00:26.238 --> 00:00:29.020
[LAUGH] I should have
mentioned that upfront.

9
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.530
I'm kidding, it's things that
I have the legal right to use,

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.930
or that maybe the legal
permission to use is better.

11
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.301
But, that's all that's in here,
just a bunch of data for that.

12
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:49.580
One thing is React Router doesn't
speak JSON natively, but,

13
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.272
however, we can bring in a JSON
loader which does speak JSON for us.

14
00:00:55.272 --> 00:00:57.390
So, go back to your
Webpack config real quick.

15
00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:06.186
&gt;&gt; Brian: And, inside of your loaders,

16
00:01:06.186 --> 00:01:09.495
either before or after, doesn't matter.

17
00:01:09.495 --> 00:01:15.869
We're going to do another object here,

18
00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:23.183
and it's going to be test : /\.json$/.

19
00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:28.440
So, again, to dissect this, this is going
to match anything that ends in JSON.

20
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.405
That said, there's no question mark
because we don't want to match .jso,

21
00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:34.420
right, that doesn't make any sense.

22
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.394
We want it to only match .JSON period,
end of sentence.

23
00:01:40.394 --> 00:01:45.317
Okay, and now we need to give it
the loader that we want to use,

24
00:01:45.317 --> 00:01:52.643
which is the 'json-loader'.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Hopefully

25
00:01:52.643 --> 00:01:54.440
that looks okay to you.

26
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.670
So, let's go and create a new file.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you maybe do

27
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.367
a checkpoint to get what they're asking?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah sure,

28
00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:11.652
I'm going to do this in a new tab.

29
00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:19.135
Hold on.
&gt;&gt; Brian: That way

30
00:02:19.135 --> 00:02:24.360
I don't have to keep
ending my talks/bundler.

31
00:02:42.286 --> 00:02:44.873
&gt;&gt; Brian: It should be good to

32
00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.630
git commit step 8.

33
00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:56.216
Yeah, okay.

34
00:02:56.216 --> 00:03:02.408
That should be up under FEM-8 now, and

35
00:03:02.408 --> 00:03:08.792
let's go ahead and do this search.jsx.

36
00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:13.048
So, a new file search.jsx and

37
00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:20.915
we're going to put that instead
of oui JS folder, okay?

38
00:03:20.915 --> 00:03:22.660
First thing we're going to
do is pull in React, right?

39
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.540
That's something you probably get used to
pretty quickly because of an employer and

40
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.500
every JSX file
&gt;&gt; Brian: Const shows.

41
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.660
So this is us gonna be pulling
in our shows that were that json

42
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.745
file that I was showing you.

43
00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:46.180
../public/data right?

44
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.040
That's the name of the file.

45
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.640
Okay and we're going to
create a new component called

46
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:02.985
Search.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

47
00:04:02.985 --> 00:04:07.550
let's do this because this is kind of fun.

48
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:15.644
We're gonna do pre
Code JSON.stringify showsnull 4 and

49
00:04:15.644 --> 00:04:20.600
close that What we're doing here is

50
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.885
this shows is just can be a large object

51
00:04:25.885 --> 00:04:31.502
full of all this data that we're getting

52
00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:36.170
from react from our data.JSON.

53
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:41.100
What I'm gonna do here is pre and code
are if you've never seen them before is

54
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.480
pre means pre-formatted in code means I'm
actually going to display code to you.

55
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.860
So it Kind of formats it nicely for you.

56
00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.560
Okay, then here, JSON.stringify, I imagine
most of you have used that before.

57
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.720
It just turns a object into a string,
right.

58
00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.780
And then if you do this 4 here means,
I think it means four indentations.

59
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.320
This is basically just
formatting it prettily.

60
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.690
I think one of the worst questions I
ever got asked in an interview is,

61
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.574
can you name the three parameters that
you can provide to JSON .string of five.

62
00:05:15.574 --> 00:05:16.274
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

63
00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.430
&gt;&gt; Brian: I actually do know but

64
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.170
I think that's such a terrible question,
right?.

65
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.250
So the first one is the data
you want to display But

66
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.350
know which no one knows what it is because
no one ever uses it is actually a replacer

67
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.610
function that you can actually
replace like basically test for

68
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.880
a certain condition and
can replace data in there like who cares.

69
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.720
And then 4 I believe is indentations.

70
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.640
I think that's correct.

71
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.960
I forgot what 4 is but
will stick with that.

72
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's number of

73
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.678
spaces.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes.

74
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.484
Nailed it.

75
00:05:48.484 --> 00:05:53.624
Okay, so
now that we have made our search.jsx.

76
00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:59.493
Now we have to pull it into clientapp.jsx.

77
00:05:59.493 --> 00:06:04.690
So now I'm going to say
const Search equals require

78
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.860
Do you have to export the module?

79
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:12.520
Did I not do that because that's
a big problem if you don't do that.

80
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.670
You do.
modula.exports = search or

81
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.830
else it's gonna try and pull in this file
and it's going to null or an undefined.

82
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.920
I think it's undefined.

83
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.830
And you know about time.

84
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:33.340
So yes say that pull
that into Klein a sex.

85
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.869
OK And now we're going to
create a second route route

86
00:06:45.306 --> 00:06:47.340
&gt;&gt; Brian: Path equals slash search.

87
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:50.959
&gt;&gt; Brian: And component,

88
00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:52.060
as you might have guessed.

89
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.630
It's going to be A search.

90
00:07:06.684 --> 00:07:07.700
&gt;&gt; Brian: Make sure you save that.

91
00:07:16.567 --> 00:07:17.275
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

92
00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:20.230
[SOUND] Bless you.

93
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.350
So now if we go over to our browser.

94
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.848
Well, first of all, I broke crap.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

95
00:07:28.848 --> 00:07:33.790
if you changed your webpack.config,
you actually have to stop it and

96
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.645
restart it.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Cuz it doesn't know how

97
00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:39.510
to speak JSON yet.

98
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.411
It loads all those loaders
at the beginning of it's

99
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:46.995
startup.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,

100
00:07:46.995 --> 00:07:50.666
so now I have some lint errors.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah,

101
00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:57.070
well if you go back to here in my
search.jsx and want spaces after these.

102
00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.800
Not a big deal because
this is just temporary.

103
00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.950
We're gonna delete it here in a second.

104
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:05.566
But if you wanna feel good about it,

105
00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:10.630
that's how you would fix that.

106
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:16.270
Okay, so now refresh your App and
we have no link there yet.

107
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:18.930
So let's just go ahead and
hack the URL to get to where we wanna go.

108
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.660
So you actually can just delete that.

109
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.400
So just make sure that it's pound/search

110
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:30.910
that's where you wanna go and
there you go.

111
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:34.085
Now we'd have like a nice JSON
display of what are all of our data

112
00:08:34.085 --> 00:08:41.180
is working for

113
00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.910
some people you have any
errors in your console.

114
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.970
OK.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I've got some sort of link

115
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:56.080
here are the my Browsers coming up okay
but, it's in red, the person error

116
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.550
the keyword const is reserved, it's.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, probably

117
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:06.250
your babble is not trim piling correctly.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think it's

118
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:10.220
the lint because the code is transpiring
and showing up okay in the browser but,

119
00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:16.140
after that it's comment
is giving in your life.

120
00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:21.309
No one goes off the top of this it's

121
00:09:21.309 --> 00:09:26.686
actually so you have it.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes and

122
00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:31.006
Jason are like Is this what
you're yes then folks like

123
00:09:31.006 --> 00:09:35.640
you Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's the only configuration we

124
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.401
did for it.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Is it standard and

125
00:09:39.401 --> 00:09:48.880
then standard-react?
&gt;&gt; Brian: That might be it.

126
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:55.238
That's not how it is?

127
00:09:55.238 --> 00:09:57.409
Yes.

128
00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.285
&gt;&gt; Brian: So someone is suggesting,

129
00:10:12.285 --> 00:10:12.810
John D.

130
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.216
is suggesting that you put this in
your ES Lint [INAUDIBLE] to say M.

131
00:10:16.216 --> 00:10:20.367
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I found it.

132
00:10:20.367 --> 00:10:24.730
The name of the file has a typo.

133
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:26.900
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Thank you.

134
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.560
&gt;&gt; Brian: All for

135
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.090
the case that seems so that work.

136
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.140
So who is seeing it just as a heads and
here.

137
00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.070
Okay then let's have any
errors that they might be

138
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:44.970
saying.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One

139
00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.810
can't seem to find the landing page
&gt;&gt; Brian: I

140
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:50.140
can't find the lemon page.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I can't find

141
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.752
it.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

142
00:10:53.752 --> 00:10:58.383
like if you just change the URL to be
that, just like that, it doesn't work.

143
00:11:08.175 --> 00:11:09.117
&gt;&gt; Brian: Mostly,

144
00:11:09.117 --> 00:11:14.950
what I'm caring about is the pound slash.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

145
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:18.369
No, it's still not saying it's defined.

146
00:11:31.443 --> 00:11:35.648
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we define it anywhere
other than, do we define landing anywhere

147
00:11:35.648 --> 00:11:40.310
other than landing.jsx and clientapp.jsx?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Did you do model that

148
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.050
exports because lending
at the bottom did oka and

149
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:48.150
then incline after JSX you poured in here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes

150
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.680
exactly like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay and

151
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.530
then route you pass it into component?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

152
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:55.770
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's that's the end of it and

153
00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:58.380
that's that's the extent of
everything that lending does.
