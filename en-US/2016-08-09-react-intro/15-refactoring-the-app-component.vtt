00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.977
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:07.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go back to
ClientApp.jsx which is where we

3
00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:08.580
are right now.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.851
And let's go ahead and
get rid of MyTitle up here and

5
00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:20.696
change these to const as
well cuz we're doing.

6
00:00:24.572 --> 00:00:26.748
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, six now.

7
00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:35.184
Did not mean to do that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

8
00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:38.370
And where my first component
to be app instead.

9
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.950
And now we're going to put in some markup.

10
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.610
So you can get rid of all the my
tile stuff in here, the first thing,

11
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.930
this bothers a lot of people.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.550
It bothers me a little
bit too to be honest.

13
00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.473
So you can say class equals app container.

14
00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:04.280
So class isn't gonna to work because
class is a reserved word in JavaScript.

15
00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.000
So unfortunately you have
to use something else so

16
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.860
that its class name works the same way.

17
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.850
You put spaces in the same way, right?

18
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.830
I've had to blah, whatever, right?

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.450
But it must be class name.

20
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.920
Just so you know that does
actually have basis in reality.

21
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.435
So if I come back in here
just to show you, and

22
00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:31.136
I say,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: var x equals,

23
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:34.410
in fact, I think I still have it in here.

24
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.531
Yeah, getElementById app,
make that bit bigger so you can see it.

25
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:42.050
And I say X.class name.

26
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.842
That's actually what the DOM calls it
internally if you're using the API.

27
00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:47.635
Right now doesn't have
a class it doesn't matter.

28
00:01:47.635 --> 00:01:48.458
Right.
But just so

29
00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:52.960
you know they're not making that up that's
actually is already what it is called.

30
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.750
I recognize it as different from class but
hopefully will a little bit forgiving and

31
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.220
you just get used to it as well so.

32
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.720
There you go.

33
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.430
Use class name everywhere.

34
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.690
You'll put class sometimes and

35
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.440
you'll forget like I do and
you'll just have to remember it later.

36
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.390
But anyway that's the big disclaimer
I give there because people get

37
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.950
upset about it.

38
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.846
Okay, class name equals home dash info.

39
00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:27.581
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And here we're going to put

40
00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:32.032
in h1 and says,
class name equals title and

41
00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:37.448
I called our App S video
because that's what I thought

42
00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:42.810
of when I was trying to
think of a name of an App.

43
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.610
It's a terrible name.

44
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.670
You can call your app
service whatever you want.

45
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.030
I just called mine S video.

46
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.909
So here we gonna put an input.

47
00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.143
className=search.

48
00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:00.556
type=text.

49
00:03:00.556 --> 00:03:04.048
placeholder=search.

50
00:03:04.048 --> 00:03:09.447
All this should look really familiar to
you because that's a valid HTML input,

51
00:03:09.447 --> 00:03:10.019
right?

52
00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.830
So you can write at the same way,
that's okay.

53
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.490
Other than className, right?

54
00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.343
But that's the one asterisk there.

55
00:03:18.343 --> 00:03:20.609
Okay, and
we're gonna put a button here as well.

56
00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.723
button className = browse-all.

57
00:03:26.484 --> 00:03:30.940
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or Browse All, okay.

58
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.070
Close and div, close and
div, render app, cool!

59
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.518
That should work.
That should be enough right there.

60
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:43.742
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

61
00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:48.059
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

62
00:03:50.268 --> 00:03:50.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go ahead and

63
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.590
give that a shot and
see what it looks like.

64
00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.071
Once everyone looks like they finished.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just

65
00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:06.545
a bunch of divs, some H1,
some input, and a button.

66
00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:08.526
Let's go ahead and do NPM run build
on this now and NPM run build.

67
00:04:21.619 --> 00:04:22.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

68
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.969
should could get a bundle output.

69
00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:28.956
Did we get get any weird
errors that they wanna talk

70
00:04:28.956 --> 00:04:34.158
about?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

71
00:04:34.158 --> 00:04:35.550
let's go see if it works.

72
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.228
So let's refresh and you should get
something that looks like that.

73
00:04:45.228 --> 00:04:46.184
It's pretty cool, right?

74
00:04:46.184 --> 00:04:49.920
You just built a little reacting point but
you get this nice landing page

75
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.330
from Windows your font probably isn't cool
cuz I think I used a Mac exclusive font.

76
00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.850
But yeah.

77
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.900
Also there's a couple of
backgrounds on there.

78
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.741
So if you go to the style.css.

79
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:06.360
This is just for fun.

80
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.650
There's one through five.

81
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.560
So if you do one refresh, there's
a couple of them they're all free clip

82
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.511
art so.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Somebody

83
00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:20.340
is asking about why is it taking so
long to run Webpack now?

84
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.408
Is that because of all the Babel loaders?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Its Babel.

85
00:05:22.408 --> 00:05:24.037
Yeah.
Babel takes a long time to run.

86
00:05:24.037 --> 00:05:26.170
And we're running it through
a lot of transformations.

87
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.700
Babel takes a long time to run.

88
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.820
But we're going to mitigate
that here momentarily.

89
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.740
I told you this workshop is all about
running up against the pain points then

90
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.410
refactoring to get away
from the pain points.

91
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.560
So we're gonna introduce
some complexity but

92
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.302
it's actually gonna get us away from the
pain point and we'll do that momentarily.

93
00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:52.077
Mark H is saying that I get app is
not defined I'm gonna go ahead and

94
00:05:52.077 --> 00:05:56.802
guess that your problem is
that one of these two did not

95
00:05:56.802 --> 00:06:00.592
get changed either line four or line 14.

96
00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:05.640
And that will probably probably
fix you hopefully anyone else?

97
00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.387
Don't be shy.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was getting no render

98
00:06:09.387 --> 00:06:13.262
method found on the return component
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No render method found.

99
00:06:13.262 --> 00:06:16.624
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I may have forgotten to find

100
00:06:16.624 --> 00:06:20.506
render.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Is this a function up here

101
00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:24.360
and is it?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Curly brackets.

102
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.841
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Look at reactor.rendered do

103
00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:30.901
you have it as a jsx thing or

104
00:06:30.901 --> 00:06:35.694
do you have it as just a method?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It was an issue, I had curly

105
00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:37.554
brackets instead of parentheses.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep,

106
00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:41.376
that makes all the difference cuz
then nothing's getting returned.

107
00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:46.439
Good call, anyone else?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Feeling good

108
00:06:46.439 --> 00:06:51.963
about it?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, looks like

109
00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:58.035
most people in chat are getting it too.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks

110
00:06:58.035 --> 00:07:03.131
like Ivory got this error that's,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: JSX value

111
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:08.882
should be either an expression or
a quoted JSX on line nine.

112
00:07:08.882 --> 00:07:12.067
Maybe you don't have matching
quotes that might be

113
00:07:12.067 --> 00:07:19.153
an issue.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

114
00:07:19.153 --> 00:07:24.055
one of the things with JSX that especially
if your syntax howlings working correctly

115
00:07:24.055 --> 00:07:28.058
right now, say I did this,
notice everything after my H1 here looks

116
00:07:28.058 --> 00:07:31.320
really weird now,
it's cuz I have a mismatched quote.

117
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.290
That's an easy way to find something is
look for the moment where your syntax

118
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.160
highlighting starts looking really weird,
that will help a bunch.

119
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.180
Okay, cool.

120
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.283
Another one that you'll see
is something like that.

121
00:07:49.283 --> 00:07:52.547
That one's a little harder to see but
just make sure you are doing opening and

122
00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:53.670
closing tags correctly.

123
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.949
But notice that changing it down there
made my syntax howling down here

124
00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:03.825
break.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

125
00:08:03.825 --> 00:08:07.727
there are some tricks like, if you get
your syntax highlighting working that

126
00:08:07.727 --> 00:08:09.600
helps you debug what you're doing.
