[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.995 --> 00:00:07.259
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so let's look at
what to test looks like the if you fail.

3
00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.962
So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you can also,

4
00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:18.970
let's do another thing, expect 1 + 1 to,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.369
can't remember off the top of my head.

6
00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.597
Is it to.equal(2), or
it might be one method.

7
00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:28.184
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think
that that's what it is.

8
00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:30.342
So let's do 5 here or something like that.

9
00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:34.424
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's run that again.

10
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.651
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope, it is .to.equal.

11
00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:54.548
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, okay, so

12
00:00:54.548 --> 00:00:59.984
this is what it looks like if
you are not doing it correctly.

13
00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:03.776
So assertionError, I expected 2.

14
00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:09.478
Sorry, so this came out to be 2 and
I was expecting it to equal 5 right?

15
00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:10.262
So that's what this looks like.

16
00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:12.354
So I think that's a nice feature,

17
00:01:12.354 --> 00:01:16.982
cuz it actually tells you what you were
expecting and what you actually got.

18
00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:23.508
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yeah,
again, I mess it up.

19
00:01:23.508 --> 00:01:27.806
It's .to.equal(5).

20
00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:34.786
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then another useful tip and
trick is you can also do x.

21
00:01:34.786 --> 00:01:39.424
So as soon as I put that x there in front
of it, it's no longer gonna run this test.

22
00:01:39.424 --> 00:01:43.306
So for example, if you're writing code and
you break a bunch of your tests and you

23
00:01:43.306 --> 00:01:47.208
just don't wanna run them until you fix
them, you can just throw that x on front.

24
00:01:47.208 --> 00:01:52.735
And now, if I come back here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It'll

25
00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:55.348
just say that my test is pending, right?

26
00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:59.007
And that this blue just basically means
it didn't actually end up running at all.

27
00:02:01.078 --> 00:02:05.044
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same with describe, you
can actually comment out entire blocks.

28
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.834
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So all useful tips and
tricks if you gonna do some unit testing.

29
00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:14.163
This is like Unit Testing 101, right?

30
00:02:14.163 --> 00:02:17.471
[LAUGH] Okay.

31
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:20.638
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a couple people
with some errors in the check.

32
00:02:20.638 --> 00:02:24.749
Could you maybe just
post a checkpoint here so

33
00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:27.933
everyone could compare and,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's make it

34
00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:28.567
work again first.

35
00:02:37.642 --> 00:02:40.788
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
let's actually make it past 2, whatever.

36
00:02:40.788 --> 00:02:44.383
Okay, git status, git add -A.

37
00:02:49.407 --> 00:02:51.279
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: -b fem-14.

38
00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:59.083
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is there a difference
between git add., and git add -A?

39
00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:04.287
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is, that's also gonna
add your deletions as well if you do -A.

40
00:03:07.738 --> 00:03:09.576
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: -A is going to
be everything that changed.

41
00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:13.346
Definitely dot is going
to have some caveats.

42
00:03:13.346 --> 00:03:14.932
For example, if you're in a subdirectory,

43
00:03:14.932 --> 00:03:17.160
it's only gonna add everything
in that subdirectory onward.

44
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.256
It's not gonna add everything
of the directory either.

45
00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:23.645
-A is gonna be everything inside of this
git-repo, it's definitely gonna be added.

46
00:03:33.168 --> 00:03:34.928
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I didn't switch branches,
did I?

47
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.316
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I just called it 15.

48
00:03:38.316 --> 00:03:41.050
git commit --amend.

49
00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:52.938
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's make that 14,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right?

50
00:03:52.938 --> 00:03:56.105
Yep, git push origin fem-14.

51
00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:59.170
Okay, I don't know why that
mattered to me, but it did.

52
00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.977
I had to fix it.

53
00:03:59.977 --> 00:04:03.769
[LAUGH] Okay, so
now hopefully we're on the same page.

54
00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.157
We have our test set up, let's go ahead
and add that to our package.json so

55
00:04:08.157 --> 00:04:11.791
we don't have to remember to
type the path every single time.

56
00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:16.605
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So first thing we wanna do,
is we're gonna fix standard later,

57
00:04:16.605 --> 00:04:19.274
cuz right now standard's
being run through webpack.

58
00:04:19.274 --> 00:04:20.058
And if you try and

59
00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:23.084
run it through test right now it's
not going to work super well.

60
00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:24.884
But anyway, we're gonna move that to lint.

61
00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:28.102
So we're gonna say lint: "standard", and

62
00:04:28.102 --> 00:04:32.570
then we're gonna change test
actually just run our unit tests.

63
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:38.217
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Some people assert that you
when you run test you wanna run both your

64
00:04:38.217 --> 00:04:39.732
linting and your unit tests.

65
00:04:39.732 --> 00:04:43.512
It's totally fine if you wanna do that,
it just takes a lot longer, and

66
00:04:43.512 --> 00:04:45.654
usually, I want to run one or the other.

67
00:04:45.654 --> 00:04:49.071
So it's gonna be,

68
00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:55.690
what do we have up here, "mocha --

69
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:03.176
require test/helpers/setup.js".
