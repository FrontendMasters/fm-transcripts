00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.043 --> 00:00:42.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah like Mark said,
my name is Brian Holt.

3
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.810
Recently start working at that spot
a year ago, recently to San Francisco and

4
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.650
yeah it's been really fun.

5
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.500
If you haven't already grew up
here to the bit.ly/ReactIntro make

6
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.560
sure it's capital R capital I, or
else you gonna get someone else's slides.

7
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.060
I don't know why but
at least I guess sensitive like that.

8
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.130
Or you can just go to
the bit this GitHub page and

9
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.790
that that's actually where it redirects.

10
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.260
I just thought that was
a little bit easier.

11
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.080
This is intended to be interactive so
please ask questions as you have them both

12
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.980
in person and online,
we've been talking about React today.

13
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.352
I've been doing Reacts for

14
00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:29.610
what is essentially an eternity in
terms of JavaScript frameworks.

15
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.410
I was the first person to
launch React code at Reddit.

16
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.370
And I was discussing with one of the React
core team members, and they said they

17
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.350
felt like they really had arrived once
Reddit had launched some react code.

18
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.070
Because we had no crossover at that point
we had just found the technology on

19
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.370
our own and said this is really cool
we want to write code in this and

20
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.570
no one had convinced us to do it.

21
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.450
Whereas, I think when it like
Khan Academy launched it before us and

22
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.240
Khan had had more
cross-pollination with react.

23
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.370
So I've been doing this for

24
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.680
almost three years now which
is crazy in terms of reactor.

25
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.820
I feel like reactors just started
to gain some steam now well

26
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.860
has already gained a lot
of steam recently.

27
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.840
Yeah but it's enjoyable,
I think you'll gonna like it,

28
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.580
it made me really enjoy writing UI code.

29
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.250
And enjoy maintaining UI code which
is an entirely separate beast.

30
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.410
So let's start diving in here.

31
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.640
You can see here, I have this web page and

32
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.620
literally this web page is what
I have here on my surface.

33
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.280
So if you want to follow step
by step of what I'm doing here.

34
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.200
It's you're literally looking at
my notes if you're on this page.

35
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.940
The way this workshop is going to
work is we're going to write code and

36
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.930
we're going to hit a pain point.

37
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.650
So that you can feel certain pain
points in the reactor community like

38
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.360
development process.

39
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.710
And then we're going to backtrack and
refactor and that's kind of the whole

40
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.720
workshop is that way, is factor refactor.

41
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.840
And it's to kind of hopefully
demonstrate to you, we're going to

42
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.749
be introducing a build step and some
transpolation, all these different things.

43
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.580
Which add complications to app, like a lot
of people said that they're fatigued of

44
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.570
JavaScript adding all these different
tools, all these different build steps,

45
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.320
all these different things.

46
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.740
And I can definitely see that if you
don't understand why you're doing it,

47
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.770
if you just instantly start writing
JSX and transpiring with babble and

48
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.330
using web pack like you.

49
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.300
You don't really understand or

50
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.550
feel that pain that made you like,
I really want this.

51
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.920
So hopefully the idea here is,
you get to this point like, okay,

52
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.840
this is really annoying,
I wish we didn't have to do this.

53
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.310
And then we'll introduce more complexity
that gets rid of that pain point, but

54
00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.160
it does add complexity of the project.

55
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.260
So that's kind of the idea here.

56
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.409
Over the course of today we're going to be
writing in and tomorrow for that matter.

57
00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:00.951
We're going to be writing, basically,
a very stripped down version of

58
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:06.560
the Netflix interface that we can be able
to watch YouTube videos on essentially.

59
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.790
And it should be pretty fun,
I really enjoyed writing this.

60
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.460
So this is not just about React.

61
00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.230
This is about the entire React ecosystem

62
00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.399
because React is just
a piece of the puzzle, right?

63
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.290
It does basically the views for

64
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.540
you then it's up to you to kind of manage
how everyone marshal the data around.

65
00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.610
How you want to interact with
the server all that's up to you,

66
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.460
React to just taking
care of one part of it.

67
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.370
Now you can choose to use React for
everything and

68
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.070
just kind of leave
everything by the wayside.

69
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.380
And that's actually a valid choice for a
lot of projects, so I'm gonna show you how

70
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.130
to do that as well but then we're gonna
start introducing more things like Redux.

71
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.130
Right to manage your state and

72
00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.730
that hopefully give you ideas of how
you want to structure your own app.

73
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.150
So ultimately, what I'm getting at here
is, React is relatively unopinionated.

74
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.110
But we're gonna start introducing
opinions as we go on.

75
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.360
Right because you introduce Webpack that's
an opinion, you introduced Standard and

76
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.780
that's an opinion, you introduce Mocha and
that's an opinion right.

77
00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.860
But I'm just showing you all
these different pieces but

78
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.260
if you have a different piece
that you want to plug in.

79
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.730
Like that's what I want you to take
away here is that these are modules,

80
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.780
these are pieces of the puzzle and
if you don't like Standard.

81
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.580
And you prefer semi-Standard or
another way of

82
00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.820
lending your code than rip out the
Standard and put in your own favorite one.

83
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.140
Or if you don't like Redux and you really
like alter FloMax rip out Redux and

84
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.290
put it in FloMax, right, like that.

85
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.450
That's kind of the idea of
what we're getting at here

86
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.560
is we want you to understand the modules.

87
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.480
We understand where the pieces go and then
you can take out the pieces you don't like

88
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.690
and put in the pieces that you do like.

89
00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.920
Or perhaps even more important liking or
disliking something, what actually

90
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.290
works for your project, that's
ultimately what we want you to do here.

91
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.973
So the opinions that I'm going to be
introducing today are, and tomorrow.

92
00:05:58.973 --> 00:06:02.392
Node JS, Express, Redux, Webpack,

93
00:06:02.392 --> 00:06:07.180
Mocha, Enzyme and
React router as well Standard.

94
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.010
And if you don't familiar
with any of these right now,

95
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.290
it's okay we're gonna
be going over this all.

96
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.690
This basically assumes,
this workshop assumes that JavaScript and

97
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.490
beyond that we'll talk
about everything else.

98
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.420
I'm gonna use some ES6 here and

99
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.030
there just because it's at this
point is force to have it for me.

100
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.470
But I don't expect you to
know any of the ES6, so

101
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:32.540
I will explain any ES6 that I'm
using to you as we're doing it.

102
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.860
But if I skip over something please feel
free to stop me and we can pause for

103
00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.910
a second and talk about ES6 as well.

104
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:44.760
Another thing keep in mind
is that we're going to be

105
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.850
exploring all these tools
as they relate to React.

106
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:50.790
But we're only scratching, like we're
gonna be deep diving and React but

107
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.360
we're not to be diving in anything else.

108
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.150
So we're all just me talking
about how these individual

109
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.940
tools just relate to React.

110
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.150
So this is definitely not
a workshop on Webpack.

111
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:06.790
You can be using some advanced features of
Webpack, but certainly not all of them.

112
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.930
So that's something to keep in mind if
you get really interested in Redux right?

113
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.520
You might wanna go deep dive later and
find out more about Redux or

114
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.080
something like that.

115
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.925
And I'm sure that my document here
is full stylistics just for warning.

116
00:07:20.925 --> 00:07:22.960
[LAUGH] Okay.

117
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.350
So if you haven't already started,
once you go ahead and

118
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.300
do some of these Setup steps,
you definitely gonna

119
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.990
need the clone the git repo, [LAUGH] or
else you cannot not have a good time.

120
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.240
Clone the git repo and
then check out the start branch.

121
00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:44.770
That's the first thing to do, if
the master branch is the finished project,

122
00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.780
we're gonna start with the start
branch which is basically a stripped

123
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.270
down repo that we can start
writing all these files into.

124
00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.420
I'm gonna to be using node,

125
00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:01.500
I actually think I'm still on node
four to one, I haven't updated yet.

126
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.100
But I think anything node four and

127
00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:09.930
above you should be, actually think
anything like if you use io.js.

128
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:15.220
I think you'd be fine or node 12.012 and

129
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:17.010
if used the harmony you
should be fine as well.

130
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.936
But that is to say just go ahead
make sure before you should be okay.

131
00:08:25.528 --> 00:08:27.067
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Once you clone the repo,

132
00:08:27.067 --> 00:08:31.700
make sure you do npm install inside of
the repo to get all the dependencies.

133
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.920
That because we don't have to do it
on fly which will be really good.

134
00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:43.980
And you can do these global
installs on your npm right now.

135
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.399
You can do them later as well,
whatever works for you.

136
00:08:48.055 --> 00:08:51.937
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm on webpack v1.12,
Mocha v2.4 and

137
00:08:51.937 --> 00:08:57.020
standard v6.0, and
I don't think any of that matters.

138
00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.602
Standard might matter if you
have anything less than 6 but

139
00:08:59.602 --> 00:09:01.190
the other ones shouldn't matter.

140
00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:08.255
And then I believe we're teaching node or
so

141
00:09:08.255 --> 00:09:13.000
React v0.14, if I remember correctly.

142
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.654
Okay, intro over, I think,
unless anyone has any questions.

143
00:09:17.654 --> 00:09:20.309
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Which branch
are we supposed to be on?

144
00:09:20.309 --> 00:09:20.978
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Start.

145
00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:26.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That does
remind me of something though.

146
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.330
Because we're gonna be
building a project together.

147
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.130
It's kind of like, you have to
like build one part of the app and

148
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:37.080
then we move on to build
the next part of the app, right?

149
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.150
And if it's the bottom part of the work
then you can't go forward in the app and

150
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:41.720
then you have like
a really frustrating time.

151
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.660
Because you're trying to fix the old
thing while we're still going forward.

152
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.320
So what I'm gonna do every still option
and this gonna create a new branch and

153
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:49.060
push it to GitHub.

154
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.240
And you're welcome to just
pull down that branch and

155
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.560
it'll have everything that I just did.

156
00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:55.410
So if you fall behind, don't worry.

157
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.860
Pretty soon, we'll catch up because
you can just pull the new branch and

158
00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:58.780
start working from there.

159
00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:02.380
And so if I go too long
without creating a branch,

160
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.240
you can just like raise your hand or
give me the middle finger or

161
