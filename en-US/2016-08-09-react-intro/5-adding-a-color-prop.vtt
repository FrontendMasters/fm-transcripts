[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:05.881
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's do one more thing here.

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.500
We want to be able to make
the colors more interesting as well.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.360
So we can be able to pass that at.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.310
Excuse me, to be able to pass
that as a color or as a property.

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.247
So what we're gonna do here
is when to say, style, colon.

7
00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:22.562
I always do that.

8
00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:26.117
Color: this.props.color.

9
00:00:32.138 --> 00:00:36.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then what we're gonna
do down here is now we're gonna start

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.610
passing color as well.

11
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.950
So this one I'm gonna
pass in Rebecca Purple.

12
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.374
Here we're going to do this is my
favorite CSS color medium aquamarine.

13
00:00:56.683 --> 00:00:59.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But just so
you know any valid CSS color here works.

14
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.100
You can use HEX,

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.830
you can use RGB, anything you can
pass to color in CSS would work here.

16
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.805
Another one of my favorite colors Peru.

17
00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:15.567
If you didn't know Peru is actually
a color in addition to being a country or

18
00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:20.045
the other I'm not using here but
you really should use is papayawhip.

19
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.100
[LAUGH] So it's one of my favorite
interview questions when I'm interviewing

20
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.269
people at Netflix is what's
your favorite CSS named color.

21
00:01:33.882 --> 00:01:36.842
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mine's definitely medium
aquamarine because what the hell is medium

22
00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:37.500
aquamarine.

23
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.360
[LAUGH] So now if we refresh,
we get syntax errors [LAUGH], cool.

24
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.760
Line ten, we have an extra
parenthesis it looks like.

25
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have a dangling comma,
I think is the problem.

26
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That should be okay, right.

27
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.660
Maybe it's not, well.

28
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.620
You're right.

29
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.476
So again, if you were wondering,
that's what medium aquamarine looks like.

30
00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.464
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] And

31
00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:05.155
that's how Peru the color looks like.

32
00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:07.630
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

33
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.510
it's literally just putting color:peru,
right?

34
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.295
Not making that up there
really is a CSS named color.

35
00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:20.113
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But as you can see,
you can pass anything into props and

36
00:02:20.113 --> 00:02:21.830
you can use it however you want to.
