00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.139
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:05.881
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
let's do one more thing here.

3
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:09.500
We want to be able to make
the colors more interesting as well.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.360
So we can be able to pass that at.

5
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.310
Excuse me, to be able to pass
that as a color or as a property.

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.247
So what we're gonna do here
is when to say, style, colon.

7
00:00:21.247 --> 00:00:22.562
I always do that.

8
00:00:22.562 --> 00:00:32.362
Color: this.props.color.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

9
00:00:32.362 --> 00:00:37.610
then what we're gonna do down here is now
we're gonna start passing color as well.

10
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.950
So this one I'm gonna
pass in Rebecca Purple.

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.123
Here we're going to do this is
my favorite CSS color medium

12
00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:56.871
aquamarine.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

13
00:00:56.871 --> 00:00:59.380
just so
you know any valid CSS color here works.

14
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.100
You can use HEX,

15
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.830
you can use RGB, anything you can
pass to color in CSS would work here.

16
00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.805
Another one of my favorite colors Peru.

17
00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:15.567
If you didn't know Peru is actually
a color in addition to being a country or

18
00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:20.045
the other I'm not using here but
you really should use is papayawhip.

19
00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.100
[LAUGH] So it's one of my favorite
interview questions when I'm interviewing

20
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.819
people at Netflix is what's
your favorite CSS named

21
00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.233
color.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mine's

22
00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:37.500
definitely medium aquamarine because
what the hell is medium aquamarine.

23
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.360
[LAUGH] So now if we refresh,
we get syntax errors [LAUGH], cool.

24
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.760
Line ten, we have an extra
parenthesis it looks like.

25
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.132
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have a dangling comma,

26
00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:53.410
I think is the problem.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That should be okay, right.

27
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.660
Maybe it's not, well.

28
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.620
You're right.

29
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.476
So again, if you were wondering,
that's what medium aquamarine looks like.

30
00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.061
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]

31
00:02:03.061 --> 00:02:04.169
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: [LAUGH] And that's how Peru

32
00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:07.480
the color looks like.
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]

33
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But it's literally

34
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.510
just putting color:peru, right?

35
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.295
Not making that up there
really is a CSS named color.

36
00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:18.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But as you can see,

37
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.830
you can pass anything into props and
you can use it however you want to.
