[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:05.390
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
let's get rid of the key thing real quick.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.420
Cause we all know that's really annoying.

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.980
So come in here to show card.

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.960
Show card.

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.510
Not show card, search, search.jsx.

7
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.063
And we have to give it a key.

8
00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:31.040
&gt;&gt; Brian: And we're gonna do show.imdbid.

9
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.180
Now the reason why we're doing
this is react is actually pretty

10
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.370
smart about the way it
does updates to the dom.

11
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.180
It has like a whole virtual dom diffing
system underneath the hood like you

12
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.760
don't really have to care what the virtual
dom is because you never really have

13
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.300
to interact with it.

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.170
You can basically interact with
react as if it was a normal dom and

15
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.650
just not care what's actually
going underneath the black box.

16
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.860
But key is basically
saying I have the show and

17
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.920
in the future if I decided
to rearrange all my shows,

18
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.380
please reuse the same dom elements, right?

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.760
So if I have Daredevil here, right.

20
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.380
And I rearrange House of Cards
to swap places with Daredevil

21
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.673
like please reuse them, right?

22
00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:19.480
And so it will be smart enough to take
one out and put it in the other but

23
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.220
the only way that it knows how to
do that is if you give it a key

24
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.690
that it can key off of, right?

25
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.320
So in this particular case if
you look at our dated R.J. sun.

26
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.520
They all have these
IMDB IDs right here and

27
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.690
these are guaranteed unique to
those different shows right.

28
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.810
So now that it has this unique ID and
I could swap these two and

29
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.340
it's smart enough to know that okay
I can keep these same dom things.

30
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.800
I don't have to create, destroy and
be less efficient, right?

31
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.310
So basically giving react to hint

32
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.740
to be able to reorder these things
without destroying things unnecessarily.

33
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.240
And so if you go back here to search,
I'll save that.

34
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.650
I'm still getting my errors.

35
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.880
I'll fix those in a sec too.

36
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.060
But if I look down here right now
I'm seeing this prop error but

37
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.120
if I refresh it'll be gone.

38
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.110
That's what that error means.

39
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.370
It says hey you're doing
a repeat on something and

40
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.590
I need to know which one is which.

41
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.630
It's basically the gist of it.

42
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.100
Question about that?

43
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.190
[BLANK-AUDIO] Make some sense

44
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.840
hopefully and I know for a fact
Angular has the same concept in there.

45
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.240
I think they're like track by or group by.

46
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.860
No, not group by I think it's track by.
