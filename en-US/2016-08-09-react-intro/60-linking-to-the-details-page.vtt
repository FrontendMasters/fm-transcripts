[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:07.070
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's go make our links
work because that really bothers me.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.620
So go in here to, let's do store.jsx.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.370
No, not store.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.681
It's in search.

6
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:19.791
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that in show card?

7
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.141
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's in show card.

8
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:21.641
Yep.

9
00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:30.930
&gt;&gt; Brian: So we're going to pull
in a link here from React router.

10
00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:44.053
&gt;&gt; Brian: And, that's so
funny, where did I do that?

11
00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:51.383
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I wanna say it's,

12
00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:56.562
again this off with the memory so,
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're gonna

13
00:00:56.562 --> 00:01:01.845
go to
&gt;&gt; Brian: Details.

14
00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:08.860
Actually let's do this like this.

15
00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:17.419
&gt;&gt; Brian: details/imdbID,
so props.imdb.ID.

16
00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:21.059
You can also do .ID as well,

17
00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:26.076
it will be props.params.id as well.

18
00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:27.970
Let's go and do it like that though,
I like that better.

19
00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:39.220
&gt;&gt; Brian: And make sure that works
also I'll have to go look it up.

20
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:44.930
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is also gonna be
a string and it also isRequired.

21
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.280
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let me check real quick,
make sure everything didn't break.

22
00:01:56.573 --> 00:01:57.745
&gt;&gt; Brian: Did break, that's not good.

23
00:02:04.975 --> 00:02:06.580
&gt;&gt; Brian: I think I need
a leading slash too.

24
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.270
Leading slash right there.

25
00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.780
&gt;&gt; Brian: So try that again.

26
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.630
Okay, now it works.

27
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.200
Okay, so now each one of these is a link,
if you click on the right one,

28
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.760
it will take you to the right page.

29
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.834
So, to recap what I did there,
brought in link right there.

30
00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:38.510
And here, I just wrapped everything
in a link to details, props.imdbID.

31
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.450
And just wrapped it all on the link.

32
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.460
And I also added two new things to,

33
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.830
actually one new thing to the prop types,
that's it.

34
00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:54.457
&gt;&gt; Brian: And
I'll cut a branch after this.

35
00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:58.451
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One question, how would
you handle clearing the search term when

36
00:02:58.451 --> 00:03:01.670
returning to the landing
page after a search?

37
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.480
There's kinda wondering what's
the best place for that action.

38
00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:11.060
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like where is the best
place to fire the action?

39
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.343
I guess I'll answer both questions.

40
00:03:14.343 --> 00:03:15.537
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Best place for
the action to live.

41
00:03:15.537 --> 00:03:18.090
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
you can you one or two things.

42
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.230
I'm a fan of making a clear state action
so you just fire off an action that says

43
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.640
clear my search term and then anyone can
fire blindly doesn't have to have like cuz

44
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.490
you can also just say set search term
to be empty string and that's fine too.

45
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.319
I guess either way I can see reasons
you don't use either one of those.

46
00:03:39.972 --> 00:03:41.190
&gt;&gt; Brian: Where the place to do it.

47
00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:48.346
&gt;&gt; Brian: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Clear

48
00:03:48.346 --> 00:03:50.960
the searchable returning
to landing after a search.

49
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.900
I probably do it on
component will unmount,

50
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.330
which we'll talk about that March
towards the end of the class.

51
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.170
But there's basically, when you're
component is leaving the page, you can

52
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.170
have it do certain actions using
what's called the life cyclemethod and

53
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.800
that particular part of the lifecycle
is called component will unmount.

54
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.380
Basically, I'm about to leave the page,

55
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.090
you can just fire off an event that says
clean my search term, that would work too.

56
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.250
With React router,
remember we did onEnter.

57
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.284
There's also an onExit as well, and
that would also be an okay place for

58
00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:25.101
that to live.

59
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:29.430
In this particular case,
I'd probably choose onExit cuz it seems

60
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.080
to really relate more to routing than
it does to component unmounting.

61
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.010
That's a judgment call though.

62
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.320
I don't know if there's
a right answer there.
