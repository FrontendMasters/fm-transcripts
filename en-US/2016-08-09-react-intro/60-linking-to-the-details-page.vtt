[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:07.070
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's go make our links
work because that really bothers me.

3
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:13.620
So go in here to, let's do store.jsx.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.370
No, not store.

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.791
It's in search.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that in show card?

6
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.141
&gt;&gt; Brian: It's in show card.

7
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:26.730
Yep.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

8
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.930
we're going to pull in a link
here from React router.

9
00:00:39.112 --> 00:00:41.842
&gt;&gt; Brian: And, that's so funny,

10
00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:51.383
where did I do that?
&gt;&gt; Brian: And I wanna say it's,

11
00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:56.562
again this off with the memory so,
&gt;&gt; Brian: We're gonna

12
00:00:56.562 --> 00:01:01.845
go to
&gt;&gt; Brian: Details.

13
00:01:01.845 --> 00:01:08.860
Actually let's do this like this.

14
00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:14.703
&gt;&gt; Brian: details/imdbID, so

15
00:01:14.703 --> 00:01:17.419
props.imdb.ID.

16
00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:21.059
You can also do .ID as well,

17
00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:26.076
it will be props.params.id as well.

18
00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:27.970
Let's go and do it like that though,
I like that better.

19
00:01:35.283 --> 00:01:37.292
&gt;&gt; Brian: And make sure that works also

20
00:01:37.292 --> 00:01:42.783
I'll have to go look it up.
&gt;&gt; Brian: This is also

21
00:01:42.783 --> 00:01:49.641
gonna be a string and it also isRequired.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let me check real quick,

22
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:57.023
make sure everything didn't break.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Did break,

23
00:01:57.023 --> 00:02:05.030
that's not good.
&gt;&gt; Brian: I

24
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.580
think I need a leading slash too.

25
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:14.780
Leading slash right there.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So try that again.

26
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.630
Okay, now it works.

27
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.200
Okay, so now each one of these is a link,
if you click on the right one,

28
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.760
it will take you to the right page.

29
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.834
So, to recap what I did there,
brought in link right there.

30
00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:38.510
And here, I just wrapped everything
in a link to details, props.imdbID.

31
00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.450
And just wrapped it all on the link.

32
00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.560
And I also added two new things to,
actually one new thing to the prop types,

33
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.588
that's it.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

34
00:02:52.588 --> 00:02:55.401
I'll cut a branch after this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One question,

35
00:02:55.401 --> 00:03:00.266
how would you handle clearing the search
term when returning to the landing page

36
00:03:00.266 --> 00:03:01.670
after a search?

37
00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.950
There's kinda wondering
what's the best place for

38
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.660
that action.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Like where is the best

39
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.060
place to fire the action?

40
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.835
I guess I'll answer both questions.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Best place for

41
00:03:14.835 --> 00:03:16.977
the action to live.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So you can you one or

42
00:03:16.977 --> 00:03:18.090
two things.

43
00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.230
I'm a fan of making a clear state action
so you just fire off an action that says

44
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.640
clear my search term and then anyone can
fire blindly doesn't have to have like cuz

45
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.490
you can also just say set search term
to be empty string and that's fine too.

46
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.050
I guess either way I can see
reasons you don't use either one of

47
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.190
those.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Where the place to do it.

48
00:03:43.504 --> 00:03:44.354
&gt;&gt; Brian: So,

49
00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.388
&gt;&gt; Brian: Clear the searchable returning

50
00:03:49.388 --> 00:03:50.960
to landing after a search.

51
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.900
I probably do it on
component will unmount,

52
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.330
which we'll talk about that March
towards the end of the class.

53
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.170
But there's basically, when you're
component is leaving the page, you can

54
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.170
have it do certain actions using
what's called the life cyclemethod and

55
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.800
that particular part of the lifecycle
is called component will unmount.

56
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.380
Basically, I'm about to leave the page,

57
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.090
you can just fire off an event that says
clean my search term, that would work too.

58
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.250
With React router,
remember we did onEnter.

59
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.284
There's also an onExit as well, and
that would also be an okay place for

60
00:04:24.284 --> 00:04:25.101
that to live.

61
00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:29.430
In this particular case,
I'd probably choose onExit cuz it seems

62
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.080
to really relate more to routing than
it does to component unmounting.

63
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.010
That's a judgment call though.

64
00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.320
I don't know if there's
a right answer there.
