[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:06.180
&gt;&gt; Brian: Universal rendering,
this is like the holy grail.

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.208
This is one of the most compelling reasons
to use both Node and React together.

4
00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:14.849
That we're basically, if you look at
our web page, if you look at just

5
00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.658
viewing source, if you view the source
there's nothing to it, right?

6
00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:25.400
There's an app file and just a little bit
of boilerplate, and that's it, right?

7
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.997
What's really kind of crappy about this,
if we have a really slow connection here,

8
00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:31.889
I wonder if I can even simulate it.

9
00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:40.722
&gt;&gt; Brian: Network, no throttle, yeah, and

10
00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:46.901
I'm gonna turn this down to super slow,
like 2G.

11
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:50.570
I don't know how well this is gonna work.

12
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.079
Connection refused, it doesn't work.

13
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.913
Just kidding, I wasn't running my server.

14
00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:02.226
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay,
look how slow our webpage is now.

15
00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.963
&gt;&gt; Brian: Isn't that horrible?

16
00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:10.481
I'm just getting gross
feelings looking at this.

17
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:14.312
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian: You can do it.

18
00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:15.415
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I would give up.

19
00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:16.010
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, wouldn't you?

20
00:01:17.745 --> 00:01:20.000
Wow, how long is this gonna take?

21
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.732
I didn't expect this to be so compelling.

22
00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:24.985
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

23
00:01:28.236 --> 00:01:29.106
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH].

24
00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:32.124
&gt;&gt; Brian: Look how slow that was,
how slow was that?

25
00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.840
That was 30 seconds.

26
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.420
Now granted this is 2G connections,
right, not even 3G.

27
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.921
But if you're, for example,
I went to China last year and

28
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:43.075
I had 2G connection for
much the time I was there.

29
00:01:43.075 --> 00:01:46.395
So, first of all, fix your web pages so
they're much lighter.

30
00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:49.502
But secondly, universal rendering is
gonna make this much better because in

31
00:01:49.502 --> 00:01:53.140
the initial payload, we're gonna
actually send down the rendered app.

32
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.320
Then we send down the JavaScript
that'll take over, and

33
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.010
then actually make your
web page interactive.

34
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.710
That's the idea going on here.

35
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.822
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could you push
a branch before we go further?

36
00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:04.517
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah sure.

37
00:02:06.413 --> 00:02:08.105
&gt;&gt; Brian: Definitely turn that off.

38
00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:12.731
I do this all the time, where I go do
things and then I forget to turn them off.

39
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.616
Okay, it turns them off for you.

40
00:02:15.616 --> 00:02:19.285
But there was a couple weeks where I had
3G speeds on my computer and I was like,

41
00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:20.574
why is this taking so long?

42
00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:22.652
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH].

43
00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:26.480
&gt;&gt; Brian: Or, one of my most embarrassing
moments was at Oscom last year.

44
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.092
I turned off JavaScript in my browser to
test something and then I left it on, and

45
00:02:31.092 --> 00:02:32.691
I was teaching a workshop on React.

46
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.590
And I was like, why doesn't this work?

47
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.067
And everyone else is working, then I
find out half hour into the workshop,

48
00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.071
I'm like, crap.

49
00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:43.355
Everything's, no JavaScript is working
because you turned off JavaScript.

50
00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:47.405
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian: So frustrating, okay,

51
00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:48.986
cut a branch.

52
00:02:55.267 --> 00:03:00.503
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's see,
git checkout -b fem-23.

53
00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:05.407
Git add ., status,

54
00:03:05.407 --> 00:03:08.409
commit -m.

55
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.399
&gt;&gt; Brian: FEM step 23,

56
00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:23.549
push origin fem-23, okay.

57
00:03:27.751 --> 00:03:33.580
&gt;&gt; Brian: So, universal rendering
is actually pretty easy with React.

58
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.867
It's actually super easy with React.

59
00:03:35.867 --> 00:03:41.587
However, we did React Router and we did
Redux, which actually makes it three

60
00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:47.488
steps more complicated to get all that
working together nicely on your server.

61
00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:51.690
So, I say universal rendering,
that's my term of preference.

62
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.534
But people call it server-side rendering
which is actually literally what it is.

63
00:03:55.534 --> 00:03:59.875
And they also call it isomorphic
rendering, which is not a great name but

64
00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:01.165
people call it that.

65
00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:03.620
All three of those things,
we're all getting at the same thing.

66
00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.236
Taking your React app,
rendering on your server, and

67
00:04:07.236 --> 00:04:11.491
then sending a completed rendered
payload down to your client.

68
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:16.976
So I did wanna show you, I have another,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Another

69
00:04:16.976 --> 00:04:18.640
workshop that I give called ES6 React.

70
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.490
And I wanted to show you
how easy it is if you don't

71
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.860
include React Router to
do universal rendering.

72
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.720
So if you look here at app.js,

73
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.770
26 lines of which many of them
are just blank lines, this is it.

74
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.450
This is all you need to get
universal rendering with just React.

75
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:48.028
&gt;&gt; Brian: So basically you do
ReactDOMServer.rendertoStringReact.

76
00:04:48.028 --> 00:04:53.229
That's it, and then you just send that
down with the payload, and that's it.

77
00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.827
So, suffice to say,
this is very simple for just React.

78
00:04:57.827 --> 00:05:02.561
And now that we're using React Router, we
have to share the routing with the server,

79
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:04.026
with the client, right?

80
00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:06.424
So, sharing the routing
is actually the really,

81
00:05:06.424 --> 00:05:08.490
really complicated part about this.

82
00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.490
The React part is very simple.

83
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.067
Actually, even the Redux
part's not too bad.

84
00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:15.006
But the React Router part is hairy.

85
00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:18.674
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah.

86
00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:22.840
&gt;&gt; Brian: So anyway,
that's what I wanted to show you.
