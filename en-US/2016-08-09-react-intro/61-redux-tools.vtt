2
00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:06.640
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Davide asked
an interesting question.

3
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.870
We're not using Redux to basically
address our routing and that's true.

4
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.080
We're using React router instead
of address or routing but

5
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.960
you can interference with do it.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.580
Actually the abstraction makes more sense
to me to have Redux handle your routing.

7
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.910
And what they actually do is,

8
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.070
I think it's called Redux React Router,
is the name of the library.

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.460
It's maintained by the same team that
does both React Router and Redux.

10
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.060
The difference being is that, you fire
Redux actions to be able to change routes.

11
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.410
But, what that really is doing,
it's a thin layer on top of react router.

12
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.240
So, it's actually react router
still doing all of your routing.

13
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.890
There is just like a kind of
a pass through using Redux.

14
00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.760
And if that makes more sense to you, to
be honest it makes more sense to me than

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.460
go off and and do that, you're welcome to.

16
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.600
They end up being pretty
similar in any way.

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.073
So, that's a good question.

18
00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:03.589
Any other questions before
we move on to Redux tools?

19
00:01:08.448 --> 00:01:11.980
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
feeling pretty good about that.

20
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.460
Just like we had react tools,
we're going to use Redux tools.

21
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.425
So go ahead and Google search for
Redux dev tools.

22
00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.577
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And there should be,

23
00:01:22.577 --> 00:01:27.116
I believe this one is actually only
on Chrome, this one right here.

24
00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:34.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Looks like
something like this, right?

25
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.860
Go ahead and add that to Chrome.

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950
I know a Firefox's is on their roadmap,

27
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.070
it's just not there yet
so, sorry about that.

28
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.570
Okay.

29
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.290
Unfortunately, the Dev Tools
in Redux are not quite free.

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.620
Remember we were talking about Middleware,

31
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.210
so you actually have to give
Redux a Middleware to be able to

32
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.810
hook into the Redux.

33
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.191
So that's what we're
gonna go do real quick.

34
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:02.669
Is we're going to go to our store

35
00:02:05.262 --> 00:02:09.800
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .JSX
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

36
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.926
here we're going to make our create
store a little bit more complicated.

37
00:02:13.926 --> 00:02:18.021
But keep in mind like for production code,
this is actually all you need and

38
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.466
the other thing is you actually
don't want to ship out Redux dev

39
00:02:21.466 --> 00:02:25.700
tools to everyone cuz it slows Redux down
ever so slightly for no good reason.

40
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.128
So here we're going to do rootReducer,
we're going to do initialState,

41
00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:37.776
and then we're going to do redux.compose.

42
00:02:40.642 --> 00:02:43.155
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you're going to
ask me what does redux.compose do and

43
00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:45.200
what is everything doing here.

44
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.250
To be totally transparent and honest,
not super sure what's going on here.

45
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.812
This is literally I just copied and
pasted from the docs to get this to work.

46
00:02:54.812 --> 00:03:01.956
[COUGH] My conjecture here is that
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You're

47
00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.540
composing multiple middlewares together.

48
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.880
It's essentially what you're doing.

49
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.700
So first thing you're gonna do is we're

50
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.710
eventually going to be get
to universal rendering.

51
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.790
I think it's actually
literally right after this.

52
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.786
No we're going to do tests then
we're gonna do universal rendering.

53
00:03:20.302 --> 00:03:23.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually maybe we'll do
universal rendering first because I have

54
00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.660
a lot of stuff to cover and
not enough time.

55
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.030
So we're going to do the typeof

56
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:40.106
window.devtoolExtension is
not equal to undefined

57
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:47.994
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Question mark,

58
00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.147
this is the turn area.

59
00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:57.578
window.devTool extension
execute otherwise F.

60
00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.855
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again this is
actually just what I copied out the,

61
00:04:04.855 --> 00:04:09.072
not exactly sure what all this is doing
but suffice to say I just copy and

62
00:04:09.072 --> 00:04:11.454
paste it out of the docs, good enough.

63
00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is basically
exposing some hooks to Redux dev

64
00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:18.849
tools to be able to use.

65
00:04:22.843 --> 00:04:24.110
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So go ahead and save that.

66
00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.290
That's it, that's all that you have to do.

67
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.270
And they have Chrome dev tools.

68
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.600
If you've been like me and been using
just the file protocol to do this,

69
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.450
Redux dev tools actually do require
that you do have an HTTP server running.

70
00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.279
So just to recap here,
I'm gonna split my terminal here.

71
00:04:49.117 --> 00:04:56.755
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna go to my project,
which is talks/bundler/complete project.

72
00:04:56.755 --> 00:05:04.011
Okay, and then here I did
an npm install --g http-server.

73
00:05:04.011 --> 00:05:07.301
I already have it, so
I'm not gonna install it.

74
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:13.702
I'm gonna do http-server

75
00:05:13.702 --> 00:05:18.437
-p8080./.

76
00:05:18.437 --> 00:05:22.530
So that'll get me my server running.

77
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.803
Okay, and to come over here to here and

78
00:05:26.803 --> 00:05:30.954
I'm gonna say local host 8080.

79
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.560
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay so
it should be relatively the same thing.

80
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.570
I might have broken all my images, but
we'll see about that in just a sec.

81
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.700
No I didn't, good job Brian.

82
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.120
Okay, no favicon.

83
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.620
Don't care.

84
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.230
So, let's go do some Redux debugging now.

85
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.700
So you can do one of two places
you can do it here and Redux.

86
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.518
This should work?

87
00:05:56.518 --> 00:05:57.332
Yep.

88
00:05:57.332 --> 00:05:58.580
You can also do up here.

89
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.480
That works too.

90
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.230
Either one of those fine.

91
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.088
I'm going to use it up here
because I think it'll be easier.

92
00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:05.849
So I'm gonna close this and use this.

93
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.400
So there's an app at in it.

94
00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.720
That's what the action that
Redux fires to be able to

95
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.880
see, sorry,
in order to initiate your Redux store.

96
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.310
And there's a bunch of
different tools here.

97
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.880
I'm going to switch over here to
the left so I can see my search box.

98
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.100
And we're going to switch to S video.

99
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.990
And there's also some
settings here you can change.

100
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.330
Right now I'm using inspect monitor.

101
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.900
You can also use chart monitor.

102
00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.430
There's a bunch of these
different monitors.

103
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.760
What I want actually wanna use,
I wanna use the chart monitors.

104
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.752
Actually, I do wanna use this one.

105
00:06:52.318 --> 00:06:57.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm gonna type here,
so I'm gonna type House right here.

106
00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:57.660
Okay.

107
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.930
Come back here and I can see all
the actions that I fired, right, so

108
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:08.220
started with h H O H U H U S E.

109
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.990
But let's see some why this is compelling.

110
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.350
So one it's interesting to see your
actions and everything you're firing.

111
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:19.240
But now I can start pretending I didn't
fire off these actions by disabling them.

112
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:24.460
And I can disable and re-enable these
actions which is pretty compelling, right?

113
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.080
This is called time traveling debugging.

114
00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:32.650
So I can go backwards and forwards in
time to see exactly what happened and

115
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.710
that's actually let's see
what that really looks like.

116
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.430
That's not what I wanted.

117
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.420
Come here to settings.

118
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.710
I want this to be bottom
monitor to be slider monitor.

119
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.210
Okay.

120
00:07:49.462 --> 00:07:51.958
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now I'm gonna do this,
go to the bottom one.

121
00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:57.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What are you doing?
I want my slider.

122
00:08:03.255 --> 00:08:05.090
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe it's log monitor.

123
00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:06.851
I get so confused, which ones which.

124
00:08:10.943 --> 00:08:12.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Bottom one.

125
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.860
Nope, still the wrong one.

126
00:08:16.928 --> 00:08:17.885
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Anyway.

127
00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:30.415
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is one of the other
monitors right here you can see all

128
00:08:30.415 --> 00:08:33.390
the different actions and
like the different times between them.

129
00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:36.150
And you can actually inspect each
one of them you can see what

130
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.290
the action looks like.

131
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:38.060
Right.

132
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.270
Value type, right?

133
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.945
What that actually looked like.

134
00:08:40.945 --> 00:08:42.340
What the diff was, right?

135
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:46.902
So, I went from ho to hou, and
what the current state is.

136
00:08:49.599 --> 00:08:52.380
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So hopefully you're
seeing why this is compelling.

137
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.750
Basically, you can enable and

138
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.150
disable actions to see how your
state is evolving over time.

139
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.497
That's really powerful because if you
have some complex bug that steps through

140
00:09:05.497 --> 00:09:09.830
a bunch of state to be able to get where
you were you can start like enabling and

141
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.983
disabling these different actions
to see what's actually happening.

142
00:09:13.983 --> 00:09:16.435
I'm really frustrated I can't
get the slider one to work.

143
00:09:24.052 --> 00:09:25.000
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe you have to close it.

144
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.535
I don't know.

145
00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:27.752
Try again.

146
00:09:30.098 --> 00:09:31.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

147
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.520
This is what I wanted to see.

148
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.920
So now I can say house right.

149
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.610
But now I can actually like time
travel which is kind of fun, right.

150
00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.770
So I can step backwards and

151
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:45.090
forwards through my different, like look
at just the search bar up here, right.

152
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.040
You can see the letters
being taken out and put in.

153
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.773
Now if that doesn't impress you,

154
00:09:53.773 --> 00:09:56.333
I don't know what will because
it's super impressive to me.

155
00:10:00.316 --> 00:10:02.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, you can
actually click the Play button, and

156
00:10:02.373 --> 00:10:04.020
it'll show you what happened over time.

157
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.080
Come on, pretty cool.

158
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.827
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does that match
the time setting to the [CROSSTALK]

159
00:10:11.827 --> 00:10:12.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think so, let's try.

160
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.890
So let's refresh the page
to get a look at.

161
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:24.863
So I'm gonna so type kim really
fast late at the second and my.

162
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:31.741
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Nope, it doesn't.

163
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:32.723
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, still.

164
00:10:32.723 --> 00:10:35.340
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Still that
would be pretty cool.

165
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:37.870
You should make a pull request.

166
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:40.440
[LAUGH]
So

167
00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:46.070
while this is only available as
a Chrome extension in Chrome.

168
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:51.920
Luckily the team as actually just
exposed this as a node NPM module,

169
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.480
so you can actually just build your
debugger straight into the web page.

170
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.300
And then, if you have it like embedded in
your iPhone app you can actually debug get

171
00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.710
straight on the iPhone app just
using native reactor views as well

172
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.770
That's a possibility.

173
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.120
I just like the Chrome extension
because it's super easy.

174
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.440
I don't have to add any code, well very
little code to my app and it just works.

175
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.390
But if you want to be able
to use the debug monitors,

176
00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:17.320
that's what they're called,
is monitors, in weird places,

177
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.370
well, we could use it on our TVs right,

178
00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:24.230
because we're running JavaScript to show,
like on your PS4 right?

179
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:28.828
That's just react in JavaScript there,
so you could do it there as well.

180
00:11:31.604 --> 00:11:33.680
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions
about the Redux Dev Tools?

181
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.382
There's a lot more to
the Redux Dev Tools and

182
00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:38.410
I'll let you kind of toy around
with them on your own time.

183
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:42.102
Suffice to say that they're
pretty impressive, I think.
