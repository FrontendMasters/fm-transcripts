[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.160
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk about state.

3
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.260
People are always surprised they a waited
this long to talk about state and react.

4
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.805
If you go to the tutorial,

5
00:00:10.805 --> 00:00:14.740
I believe it's one of the first
things they teach you about.

6
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.600
And to be totally honest, it's one of
the more useful concepts in react.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.020
But I also want to show you that
you can make fairly large and

8
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.790
complicated apps with no state whatsoever.

9
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.860
Our app right now has zero
statefulness to it, right?

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.060
And that's really powerful
because state causes bugs.

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.210
Like that's just like the end of sentence
and it's particular you talk to any

12
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.005
functional programmer they're going to
say like the state is that is the devil.

13
00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:40.394
Right?
Not going quite that far.

14
00:00:40.394 --> 00:00:43.130
Because UI development is
inherently stateful to some degree.

15
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.740
You can't truly escape it.

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.510
Something must be keeping
track of state at some level.

17
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.690
But the point is to minimize your
surface of state keeping and

18
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.480
that's exactly what we've done so far.

19
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.349
So now, we're just going to start
introducing statefulness to our app.

20
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.930
So, we're going to make a navigation bar.

21
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.120
Thank you, person for asking that.

22
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.180
I don't know,
I didn't see who it was Faun.

23
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340
Thank you, Faun for asking that.

24
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.110
Hopefully I'm saying your name right.

25
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.323
Okay, so
inside of dif container inside of search.

26
00:01:20.323 --> 00:01:27.761
Okay, so let's go to search here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And,

27
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:31.570
this is me inside of container and
above shows.

28
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.612
Okay, so here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

29
00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:40.400
we're gonna put a header className
equals you might have guessed header.

30
00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:46.292
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Inside of here,

31
00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:50.002
we're gonna put our branding
cuz marketing and SCO and

32
00:01:50.002 --> 00:01:55.333
all those terrible things you don't
want your product manager to talk about.

33
00:01:59.507 --> 00:02:02.720
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna put

34
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.256
an input here, className,

35
00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:13.493
='search-input' type='text'

36
00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:18.976
placeholder='Search' /&gt;.

37
00:02:18.976 --> 00:02:22.094
Okay, you wanted to look
at that the way it looks.

38
00:02:22.094 --> 00:02:27.390
Click save.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Come back over here.

39
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.500
Refresh, should see something
like this at the top.

40
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.560
Nothing too useful yet.

41
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.210
I mean, you can type in it but
nothing's listening for

42
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.660
those events so nothing cares yet.

43
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.109
I thought we have a nice
fixed scrolling header there.

44
00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:49.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so

45
00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.369
now that we have that in place.

46
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.190
So far, we've been using exclusively what
have been called, well I mean recently

47
00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.790
since the beginning of the class
stateless function components.

48
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:02.820
Right, remember that?

49
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.120
When we switched from
the create class to this.

50
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.070
We haven't really looked back since.

51
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.740
You actually now have to go back, right,
because we're about to introduce state,

52
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.980
thus we can't use stateless components,
right?

53
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.416
Hopefully that makes sense.

54
00:03:15.416 --> 00:03:21.065
[LAUGH]
So there's actually two ways to write

55
00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:25.785
state for components there is the create
class which we looked at already.

56
00:03:25.785 --> 00:03:29.826
So, let's actually start by running
that since that's more familiar to you

57
00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:30.455
right now.

58
00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:35.801
So we're going to change
this to be whatever,

59
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:40.882
do it this way equals react.createClass.

60
00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:47.229
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay and

61
00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.435
then this is ultimately
gonna wrap this down here.

62
00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:53.650
Okay, and then this has to be
inside of a render method.

63
00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.647
So render-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

64
00:04:00.647 --> 00:04:08.241
then indent this one more, two more,
actually and we're going to return this.

65
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:21.182
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

66
00:04:21.182 --> 00:04:23.340
So I just wrapped this in create class.

67
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.120
I put a render method in it and then
instead of the render method I return all

68
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.194
of that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This should look pretty

69
00:04:33.194 --> 00:04:36.724
familiar right like we already did this
once we just haven't done it for a while.

70
00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Questions about that?

71
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.730
I mean you can save this and
if we look over here that's just fine.

72
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.430
Refresh it.

73
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.160
Nothing changed.

74
00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.687
Everything's okay.

75
00:04:56.687 --> 00:04:57.709
You wouldn't expect to say

76
00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.748
anything different.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

77
00:05:00.748 --> 00:05:03.039
now this allows us to track state.

78
00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.429
I'm gonna go ahead and
show you the other way.

79
00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:07.550
And it's up to you to decide
which one you like better.

80
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.550
Is anyone familiar with ES6 classes?

81
00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.653
Yeah, so we can say,
class Search extends React.component.

82
00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:26.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now this also works.

83
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.330
Now, there are people that really,
really don't like react components.

84
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.270
Because if you're coming
from like a Java world or

85
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.860
something that has more
classical type inheritance.

86
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.290
This looks and feels familiar and
it's lying to you.

87
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.540
[LAUGH] This is actually still
a JavaScript prototypal inheritance.

88
00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.100
So when that bites you in the ass,
it bites pretty hard.

89
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.270
So just be aware this is not Java.

90
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.430
[LAUGH] It says JavaScript,
it is not Java.

91
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.190
This also has some drawbacks to it.

92
00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.720
Namely, this does not have auto-binding,
and we'll get to eventually later what

93
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.900
auto binding means in react, so we'll talk
about it, whereas the other syntax does.

94
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.420
So, I think my notes
are all in the ES6 classes.

95
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.240
I think in the stick with this.

96
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.280
I think it's a little bit more
clear especially for beginners.

97
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.621
Does anyone have a preference?

98
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:18.485
Either way.

99
00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:20.301
Okay, cool.
