00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.872
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.872 --> 00:00:06.520
&gt;&gt; Brian: Let's go do some
debugging techniques.

3
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.830
We're gonna talk about
react tools right now.

4
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.117
So, so far I've been making
you use console.log for

5
00:00:13.117 --> 00:00:18.790
everything and or alerts or
dumping your state out to the dom.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.506
We're actually use a Chrome extension now
to be able to inspect what's happening

7
00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:24.475
inside a react.

8
00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.610
And they're called react dev tools.

9
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.960
They're officially supported and
created by the react team.

10
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.794
So come over to your browser and
search for like react dev tools.

11
00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:37.786
They exist both for Firefox and for

12
00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:42.260
Chrome I'm gonna use the Chrome one
because that's the one I know how to use.

13
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.217
I believe they are also making them for
Safari it might even already exist on

14
00:00:47.217 --> 00:00:50.497
Safari I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

15
00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:54.348
if you're using Microsoft Edge I
believe what you can do is you actually

16
00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:58.648
go grab the Chrome DevTools and point your
chrome DevTools at Microsoft edge and

17
00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:00.420
that'll actually work.

18
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.500
I'm not gonna show you how cuz
I saw someone do it once and

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.526
I haven't done it myself so.

20
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.073
Okay, so go ahead and

21
00:01:07.073 --> 00:01:11.981
download this extension.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then what

22
00:01:11.981 --> 00:01:15.680
you're gonna need to do unless you're
running your own dev server, I'm not.

23
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.260
I'm just running it from my file protocol.

24
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.528
If you're running it from your own like
H.T.T.P. server or simple H.T.T.P.

25
00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:24.639
server or whatever then you're golden.

26
00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:26.100
You need to do anything.

27
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.550
If you're like me, and you're running
it from file, go to Chrome and

28
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.170
by the way I don't know
how to do this in Firefox.

29
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.895
So if you’re on Firefox
you’re on your own.

30
00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:39.650
chrome://extensions and

31
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.030
then go down here and
find react tools, wherever that is.

32
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.370
Jeez I have a lot of extensions.

33
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.170
Go down here and say allow access to
file URLs, and you have to do that or

34
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.870
else it's not going to work locally.

35
00:01:54.602 --> 00:01:59.858
So chrome://extensions and allow access

36
00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:05.302
to file URLs right there.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

37
00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:09.783
Once you have that then you can come
back over here to your svideo and

38
00:02:09.783 --> 00:02:13.560
what we're gonna do is we're
gonna open our dev tools.

39
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.751
For those of you who don't
know how to do that.

40
00:02:17.751 --> 00:02:20.406
I think you can do it with.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: F12.

41
00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.502
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah, F12 on Mac or

42
00:02:22.502 --> 00:02:27.980
sorry on Windows it's alt
command J to open them on Mac.

43
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.380
Okay.

44
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.540
And now you should have this react tab,
now, if you're not seeing it.

45
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.650
First of all, make sure that file is
checked, the one that we saw over here.

46
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.627
Also, try restarting your
browser that might also help.

47
00:02:48.627 --> 00:02:53.358
I will say it's a bit finicky sometimes to
be able to see this because if it doesn't

48
00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:55.896
detect react on the page
it doesn't display

49
00:02:55.896 --> 00:03:00.822
the tab.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay is

50
00:03:00.822 --> 00:03:03.060
anyone not seeing it that's
expecting to see it?

51
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.350
Speak now or forever hold your peace.

52
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.492
Okay, so
now we kind of have sorry this is kind

53
00:03:17.492 --> 00:03:22.256
of probably a little bit harder to see

54
00:03:25.364 --> 00:03:29.859
&gt;&gt; Brian: The.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay so

55
00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.996
we see we have App right that's
the name of our route component.

56
00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:37.480
And if you go in here you see a router and
then disclaimer here router is adding

57
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.700
stuff in the middle, that you don't
necessarily have to worry about.

58
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.692
So we see the layout right, that's the one
that we created that's the layout for

59
00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:45.310
the whole page.

60
00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.500
Now we can go into search, right?

61
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.790
That's the name of our search route.

62
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.050
And then let's look here,
so let's search right?

63
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.020
We have properties that
are all getting past in.

64
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.527
We can check out what those properties
are, in this case it's empty.

65
00:04:01.527 --> 00:04:04.267
If you look down at State,
we can see search terms is blank, but

66
00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:05.419
if I start typing in here.

67
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.070
It's gonna start updating which is
pretty cool and actually you know,

68
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.690
I wanna update it down here, I can say no
you know what make this dare right and

69
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.100
then it'll actually update the state
directly into react for you.

70
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.610
That's only possible state, right?

71
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.531
That makes sense, because a component
can only modify its own state,

72
00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:30.634
it cannot modify its properties.
&gt;&gt; Brian: You

73
00:04:30.634 --> 00:04:34.650
can see what routes are being passed in,
you can look at the route props like that.

74
00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.410
All that's available to you.

75
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.025
Or like say if I clicked into daredevil or
not clicks but

76
00:04:41.025 --> 00:04:49.930
details/ do I have one here?

77
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.600
Here we go.
&gt;&gt; Brian: There we go look at that one.

78
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.300
So now I'm in my details route.

79
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.820
I can see what's going on here.

80
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.510
I can see the route prints are for that.

81
00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.840
I can look at what's in my header
right now doesn't have any props which

82
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.610
is what we would expect.

83
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.060
So let's talk about some other
neat features we can do here.

84
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.062
So first of all hopefully that's helpful
for you just to be able to look at

85
00:05:17.062 --> 00:05:19.953
the state and the properties right,
that's pretty A plus cool right.

86
00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:24.634
But we can also do some really fun
stuff and I say I wanna figure out what

87
00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:28.529
component this is or
maybe my back buttons broken right.

88
00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:30.706
So I'm going to say
right click on this and

89
00:05:30.706 --> 00:05:33.080
say inspect right we're
used to doing that.

90
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.000
That's going to take you
over to your elements

91
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.670
like this is just
the normal browser right.

92
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.700
But while this is selected
in my elements browser.

93
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.040
I can actually go over to react and it's

94
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.620
going to be smart enough to find what
that actually is whatever I have

95
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.760
selected over there is actually going to
be selected over my react tools, right.

96
00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.458
So now this is highlighted.

97
00:05:58.458 --> 00:06:03.580
But, right, I can actually see that
it's selected that over there.

98
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.790
So just, let's say we want to look at
the poster, maybe the poster's not right.

99
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.292
So you say Inspect.

100
00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:12.420
All right, so
it selected that in my element browser.

101
00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.959
And now I'm going to go
over to the react tools.

102
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:17.670
And notice that now that is
selected in my react tools as well.

103
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.640
So that's a really easy thing to do.

104
00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.960
Let's say I need to
interact pro-grammatically.

105
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.280
Maybe there's a method on it I wanna call.

106
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.950
I'm going to go in and select header which
is my entire header here in my react tools

107
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:39.008
and I'm going to go to my console
I'm going to say dollar $ R

108
00:06:39.008 --> 00:06:44.250
and that's actually, now I can
pro-grammatically interact with it, right.

109
00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:54.070
So I can say $ R.props and right now I
just get back the empty object, right, but

110
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.840
I could be able to now pro-grammatically
interact with this in an interesting way.

111
00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.640
So a dollar sign R is whatever you
have selected in the react tools.

112
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.562
I think that's also fairly cool in my

113
00:07:07.562 --> 00:07:12.247
opinion.
&gt;&gt; Brian: As an aside if you're not

114
00:07:12.247 --> 00:07:15.970
aware of this, this is just a chrome
dev tools thing in general.

115
00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.390
You can actually say,
I want to select video info.

116
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.456
So I just do that in my elements browser.

117
00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:24.137
I can go back to console and
say dollar sign zero, and

118
00:07:24.137 --> 00:07:28.489
that's actually going to be
the same way to interact with that

119
00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:31.848
programmatically using
the Chrome dev tools.

120
00:07:31.848 --> 00:07:37.320
FYI.
&gt;&gt; Brian: [COUGH]

121
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.670
I'll leave you to do
the rest of that yourself.

122
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.670
I mean that's more or
less gist of the react tools but

123
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:49.370
any questions about that the just
incredibly useful for debugging.
