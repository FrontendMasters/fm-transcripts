00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:05.520
&gt;&gt; Brian: So let's talk about chunking.

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.510
This is one of the more advanced
features of Webpack, but

4
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.914
I find it really compelling so
I wanted to talk about it.

5
00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:14.450
And it's, I would say, one of
the lesser known features of Webpack.

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.130
So we have this big problem right now.

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.476
I think it's a pretty big problem
that if we go in here, and

8
00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:28.024
we were looking at this earlier,
that how big is our bundle?

9
00:00:28.024 --> 00:00:32.220
Our bundle is absolutely ginormous, right?

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.164
Well it's falling out of cache, right?

11
00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:38.174
But if we look here, our bundle is 945 kB.

12
00:00:38.174 --> 00:00:42.899
And what's really dumb about this is that
we have our details page, and we have our

13
00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.914
landing page, and we have all these pages
that we're loading all the JavaScript for.

14
00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:51.229
But we're not actually using them
until we actually land on those pages.

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.060
And so if you have a giant app, right, and

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.550
you have 50 pages, it sucks that your
users have to download the JavaScript for

17
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.350
all 50 pages, when in reality,
they actually only need the one page.

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.190
Not only that,
if you have a bunch of modules, right, it

19
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.270
would be great if you could only download
the correct modules for the correct pages.

20
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.120
So Webpack actually has this
magically built into it,

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.990
because it builds a dependency graph
of all of your different dependencies.

22
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.240
And if you say, hey Webpack,
I only want this page,

23
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.210
it's smart enough to say, okay,
this page only has these things, and

24
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.380
it only shares these modules with
these different other modules.

25
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.820
So it's smart to be able
to section off as okay, for

26
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.960
example, we use axios on details but
nowhere else, it says okay,

27
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.090
I will only load axios when I'm
on details but nowhere else.

28
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.090
So that's what Webpack chunking is and
I swear it's absolutely magical.

29
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.860
It's going to just blow your mind.

30
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.621
Okay, so first we need to tell
Webpack yes, we wannna do chunking.

31
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:55.162
So let's go to webpackconfig real quick.

32
00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:01.653
&gt;&gt; Brian: Inside the output config object.

33
00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:06.628
So we need to tell,
&gt;&gt; Brian: Webpack

34
00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:08.860
where to put all the chunks.

35
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:17.383
And we're gonna say publicPath here,
:/public/.

36
00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:18.490
So you need both of those.

37
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.440
So this is actually telling axios where
am I serving my static files from

38
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.570
on my server.

39
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.130
Webpack has to know that because it has to
know where to ask for those bundles, okay?

40
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.250
And now we're gonna change chunks from
false to true, because we actually do

41
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.334
wanna see that data now.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so that's it.

42
00:02:38.334 --> 00:02:42.160
Webpack is, after that,
smart enough to know what to do.

43
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.701
I do have a mistake here that
you'd offer in my dependencies.

44
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:55.431
So just do an npm install
--save node-ensure.

45
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.288
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, pretty sure that's

46
00:03:06.288 --> 00:03:14.926
the line I needed.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yes,

47
00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:16.609
that's exactly the one I needed.
