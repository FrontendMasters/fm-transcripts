[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:06.821
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know about you,
but I find interacting or

3
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:11.340
writing my code inside script tags
a little gross, because it is.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.547
So what we're gonna do is we're actually
gonna pull this out into a separate script

5
00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:16.400
file right now.

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.949
So you're free to just cut
all of this if you want.

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.010
And then we're going to
create a new folder.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.710
So I'm just gonna do it here, New Folder.

9
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.952
Call it JS.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

10
00:00:36.952 --> 00:00:38.960
then inside JS here,
I'm gonna make a new file.

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:47.250
I'm gonna call it ClientApp.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.296
put everything in there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: As

13
00:00:52.296 --> 00:00:54.856
just a quick aside, I use Sublime, so

14
00:00:54.856 --> 00:00:59.816
I'm gonna show people that are using
Sublime just a little useful trick.

15
00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:04.114
Unfortunately I don't know useful
tricks for any other editor.

16
00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:08.761
If you Shift+Command+P and you can
say install package up here, right,

17
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:12.671
if you have package control,
which if you're using Sublime,

18
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.494
you should really be
using package control.

19
00:01:15.494 --> 00:01:21.072
And then you wanna install
install the babel package.

20
00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:22.214
I already have it installed so

21
00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:27.507
I'll just show you what it looks like.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one right here,

22
00:01:27.507 --> 00:01:32.106
syntax definitions for
EX6 JavaScript with React JSX extensions.

23
00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:33.432
Go ahead and install that one, and

24
00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:36.286
your syntax highlighting is gonna be
way better throughout all of today.

25
00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:40.934
So, if you're using them,
I've heard it's a real pain in the butt

26
00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:45.660
to get it to play nicely with JSX and
ES6, so good luck.

27
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.209
And I believe that there is a babel
package for Adam that also works just as

28
00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:55.325
well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

29
00:01:58.121 --> 00:01:59.486
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And everything will still

30
00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.036
work if you don't have that,

31
00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:05.203
it's just that your syntax highlighting
might look a little weird sometimes.

32
00:02:05.203 --> 00:02:08.740
Okay, so now we've put all this inside of

33
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.620
ClientApp.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we created the JS

34
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.372
directory, we put in ClientApp.js,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

35
00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:23.995
back here, we're going to delete all that.

36
00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:27.694
And where it was, we're just gonna
put now another source here.

37
00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:32.996
src="js/ClientApp.js"

38
00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:40.386
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

39
00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:45.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, hopefully,

40
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.165
if we refresh again.

41
00:02:47.165 --> 00:02:48.454
It still works still works, right,

42
00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:49.790
it still works the way we expect it to.

43
00:02:52.194 --> 00:02:53.117
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

44
00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:54.674
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a reason you

45
00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.460
put the JS folder outside
the public directory?

46
00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The reason is

47
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.812
eventually we're going to be serving
things in the public directory and

48
00:03:02.812 --> 00:03:06.570
we're gonna be storing all of
our source in the JS directory.

49
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.590
So things in JS will not
necessarily be served later.

50
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.720
That's a good question, and
another aside I'll say is that

51
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.680
this is not necessarily a great
workshop for code organization.

52
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.350
So definitely don't take this as gospel
as the way to organize all of your code.

53
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.990
I find that I'm ultimately always
dissatisfied with the way I organize code.

54
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.407
Like as soon as I get far enough down the
road, it's like I'm an idiot, right, and

55
00:03:30.407 --> 00:03:32.517
so I just embrace the oblivion, I guess.

56
00:03:32.517 --> 00:03:33.017
