[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:07.780
&gt;&gt; Brian: So let's go ahead and
make a landing now link to search.

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.359
So what we're gonna do
is here in landing what

4
00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:19.850
we're gonna do,
is we are gonna say const link.

5
00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:24.496
Put the curly braces
around it equals require

6
00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:30.082
react-router.
&gt;&gt; Brian: And

7
00:00:30.082 --> 00:00:32.344
we're gonna make the browse-to link there.

8
00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:38.347
So instead I'm speaking of this button,

9
00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:41.952
change this to be a link.

10
00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:44.225
Both the opening and the closing tag here.

11
00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:48.793
Okay and then give it a to,

12
00:00:48.793 --> 00:00:55.655
some sort of an a traffic, give it a to.

13
00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:00.840
And that's it, that's all you need to do.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That link cannot

14
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.611
link.
&gt;&gt; Brian: So

15
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:09.444
the nice thing about using link is
that's internal to react router.

16
00:01:09.444 --> 00:01:12.485
And so whenever we're gonna change
histories, we'll have to change anything.

17
00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:17.090
It just all magically works cuz otherwise
what this is actually going to is actually

18
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.812
going to pound slash, right?

19
00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:21.069
But, you don't have to care
about that if you're using link,

20
00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:23.470
like link will just internally take
care of all that magic for you.

21
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.280
That's a good question.

22
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.490
The answer is you can get this to
work using anchor tags if you want.

23
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.190
Okay, so save that,
make sure nothing is breaking.

24
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.291
Make sure your web pack
is actually running.

25
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.153
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay.

26
00:01:56.153 --> 00:01:59.310
So refresh this again on the landing page.

27
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.020
So now if you hover over this.

28
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.720
I did that wrong.

29
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.263
You actually want this to
go to slash search, right?

30
00:02:08.263 --> 00:02:09.327
Derp.

31
00:02:09.327 --> 00:02:13.090
Right, otherwise it's
just linking to itself.

32
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.950
Like, good job, Brian.

33
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.980
[LAUGH]
So now I'll save that again.

34
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.790
Web pack ran okay.

35
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:20.560
Now refresh that.

36
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.680
Now if you look down here, you'll see
that, it's really hard to see here but

37
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.320
in the bottom left you can
see the tiny URL down there.

38
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.391
If you click on it, it will actually
take you to the other page.

39
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:37.044
And now you can actually go back and forth
just using back and forth up here, right?

40
00:02:37.044 --> 00:02:41.637
So that's one of my favorite parts about
react router is it actually uses real

41
00:02:41.637 --> 00:02:42.760
links.

42
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.020
So if I like Cmd+Click on this, it's gonna
open in a new tab and that works okay.

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.530
It doesn't break the web like
some other single page apps do,

44
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.568
which is a plus in my book.
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, any questions

45
00:02:58.568 --> 00:03:02.964
about links or anything like that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you show me the landing

46
00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:04.822
GSX again?
&gt;&gt; Brian: Yeah of course.
