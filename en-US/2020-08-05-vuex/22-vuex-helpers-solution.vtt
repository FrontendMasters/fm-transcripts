00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.635
For this particular exercise, the idea
was to use mapState and mapActions.

2
00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:10.279
So what we did is we essentially
took all of the state

3
00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:14.383
that is currently using this.$store, and

4
00:00:14.383 --> 00:00:18.382
then we changed it so
that it uses mapState.

5
00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:20.884
So we are doing ...mapState, and

6
00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:25.574
then we're passing in the specific
state pieces that we're using.

7
00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:31.274
So we're using supply, and
this is a typo, we're using isRestocking.

8
00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:33.646
So those are the two pieces
that we're gonna use.

9
00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:37.624
So we no longer are doing
this.$store.state, we are,

10
00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:46.443
Doing this, I mean we're using this.supply
directly and this.isRestocking directly.

11
00:00:46.443 --> 00:00:51.496
And similarly for mapActions,
you might have noticed that

12
00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:57.066
we have the ability,
as I mentioned earlier, to rename things.

13
00:00:57.066 --> 00:01:00.870
So in my button I called it restock.

14
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.437
So I want to map the name of that
particular thing to the action, let's say.

15
00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:12.290
So I call restock and
then fetchFromInventory.

16
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.792
And then I can create a method called

17
00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:20.478
restock which can then
call restock directly.

18
00:01:20.478 --> 00:01:26.239
It's important for you to know that
you need to have this particular

19
00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:31.295
method in your components that
hooks up actions to specific

20
00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:36.367
pieces that happen in your code
like click events and so on.

21
00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.643
Because that's how exactly
a dispatch happens.

22
00:01:38.643 --> 00:01:43.590
The action isn't automatically called,
you need to have a way of calling it.

23
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.007
And so in this case, I have restock, and
then I'm calling that specific action,

24
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:52.084
which is called restock
because I renamed it.

25
00:01:52.084 --> 00:01:56.276
And then similarly I used dispense,
which is a separate thing.

26
00:01:56.276 --> 00:02:00.579
And so I can create a method called
dispense that calls dispense.

27
00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.823
You can easily rename them,
because they can get really confusing.

28
00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:10.228
Especially since you might not
want them to match one-to-one.

29
00:02:10.228 --> 00:02:16.626
So you can just rename it so that it's
not dispense, it can be, It can just

30
00:02:16.626 --> 00:02:21.513
be dispenseItem, and then you can change
it so that it's dispenseItem, and so on.

31
00:02:21.513 --> 00:02:27.077
So that is the particular exercise
with regards to mapActions,

32
00:02:27.077 --> 00:02:33.475
essentially Vuex helpers and
using them within single file components.

33
00:02:33.475 --> 00:02:39.115
We talked about how exactly
to extrapolate the store so

34
00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:44.885
that we can use components and
so on within applications
