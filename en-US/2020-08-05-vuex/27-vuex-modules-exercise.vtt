00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.295
What we'll do now is we're going to
utilize some of this concepts and

2
00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:09.053
move all of our code into
separate vuex modules.

3
00:00:09.053 --> 00:00:12.747
So we're gonna take our store,
our getters, our actions and

4
00:00:12.747 --> 00:00:15.386
then move them into separate vuex modules.

5
00:00:15.386 --> 00:00:18.947
We're gonna move into the solution for
this particular exercise.

6
00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:23.325
And for that,
I'm going to cd into my specific thing and

7
00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:27.064
I'm currently checked
out in the right place.

8
00:00:27.064 --> 00:00:32.807
I'm gonna show you what the code
looks like, because I think again,

9
00:00:32.807 --> 00:00:37.180
it's valid for
you to see what exactly we are doing.

10
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.246
Let's look at what the code looks like.

11
00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:47.693
So we have our instance of inventory and
then we have the machine state as well.

12
00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:51.353
And again, don't worry about functionality
or anything cuz nothing is hooked up,

13
00:00:51.353 --> 00:00:52.082
nothing works.

14
00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:58.840
It's purely just to show you
the extrapolation of modules.
