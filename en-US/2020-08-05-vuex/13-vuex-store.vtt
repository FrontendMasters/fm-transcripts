00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.746
All right, so for the next section
we're gonna talk about something,

2
00:00:03.746 --> 00:00:06.566
that's actually how we're
using Vuex in real life.

3
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:10.954
So the examples in the code
that I showed you in

4
00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:15.585
the past two parts were
mostly Vuex in CodePen.

5
00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.068
Which is a single Vuex view instance,
which can be useful if you wanna do

6
00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.740
something really quick, if you wanna
check whether, or not things work.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.290
But oftentimes when you use Vuex,
you're actually using it in the context of

8
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.652
a single file component,
which is how Vue is organized.

9
00:00:30.652 --> 00:00:36.392
So we want to be able to isolate Vuex,
because in the CodePen examples,

10
00:00:36.392 --> 00:00:41.368
we had Vuex sitting in the same
place that we have our Vue code,

11
00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:44.931
and that is generally not common practice.
