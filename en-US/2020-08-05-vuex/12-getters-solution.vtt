00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.490
For exercise, to work with Vuex getters,
we are going to work on

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.660
switching out the logic in our component
so that it's switch languages.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.616
And the logic for switching languages
is handled in our Vuex getter.

4
00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:18.984
Let's look at the code just to
see what exactly I mean by this.

5
00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:22.350
So here we have our inventory.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.261
Specifically the item as
well as some supplies so

7
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:27.748
we can decrement as well as increment it.

8
00:00:27.748 --> 00:00:33.394
But the piece that I want you to
focus on is this essentially so

9
00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:37.839
I can toggle between
languages really easily.

10
00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.916
And so that is the exercise that
we are going to be working on.

11
00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:44.450
We'll go over the solution for
this particular exercise.

12
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.429
And I'll pull up the version that
doesn't work at the moment and

13
00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.480
we'll slowly work our way through
to get to what we need to do where

14
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.917
the translation happens in the getter and
not in the component itself.

15
00:00:56.917 --> 00:01:01.626
So one thing to note is that we
have this translations object

16
00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:06.536
that's sort of outside of our
Vuex store and our components.

17
00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:12.557
The way in which we are doing the language
toggle does happen in the dispatch.

18
00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:18.615
So we are dispatching a toggle language
and the action is actually toggling and

19
00:01:18.615 --> 00:01:21.950
switching that language appropriately.

20
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.659
So that is happening, but

21
00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.167
the piece in which the data is
updated happens within the component,

22
00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:33.315
which is sort of what we want to move away
from, we want to use a getter instead.

23
00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:34.968
So in order to do this,

24
00:01:34.968 --> 00:01:40.200
we need to update this particular
piece which is the translation code.

25
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.231
So we're going to be moving
away from doing this,

26
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:46.336
which is essentially
grabbing the translations.

27
00:01:46.336 --> 00:01:49.170
So we're adding the translations
to the data attribute and

28
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.389
then we are specifically
grabbing the state.

29
00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:56.110
So what we can do instead is
we can move this to a getter.

30
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.787
So the way that we'll do that is we will
have a getter, and already is there.

31
00:02:02.787 --> 00:02:05.495
It's called translate Lang.

32
00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:10.782
And what we'll do is we will look for

33
00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:13.785
the translations.

34
00:02:13.785 --> 00:02:16.629
And then I believe it's
accessing the states.

35
00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.401
Hold on, I need to check this, yeah.

36
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:25.490
So the way we're doing it is we're
just looking at translations which

37
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.715
is a global object and then we're going to
specifically grab the language selected.

38
00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:34.958
So we have access to the states and
we can grab that and

39
00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:39.839
we obviously need to return it because
the getter requires that return value.

40
00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:45.780
And then in our translation itself,
we're no longer hard coding that piece.

41
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.472
We're just going to return that getter.

42
00:02:50.472 --> 00:02:54.204
So we called our getter,
I believe, translate Lang.

43
00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:59.175
So let's call it this and

44
00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:02.258
then we run it.

45
00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:08.488
And our code should work as expected.

46
00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:13.048
Because now it is no longer doing
the hard coding of the translation in our

47
00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:16.279
component, it's doing it
via the getter itself.
