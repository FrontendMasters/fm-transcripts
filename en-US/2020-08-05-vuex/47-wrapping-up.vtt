00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.883
This is the conclusion of the workshop.

2
00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:09.714
Again, I'd like to highlight that there
is a repo with a lot of resources.

3
00:00:09.714 --> 00:00:13.707
Frontend Masters-UX,
it has all of the code.

4
00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:18.525
I'll make sure that any updates
that I need to make are propagated.

5
00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:20.511
But it has all the things that I use.

6
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:23.930
So it has the view Chrome Dev Tools
which are incredibly handy.

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.395
Again, I stress super handy,
as well as the slides,

8
00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:30.024
which I used in this particular course.

9
00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:34.221
There's also some bonus content which
I didn't really talk about because we

10
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:35.136
ran out of time.

11
00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:40.731
But View3 is coming soon,
maybe when this gets released.

12
00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:42.638
I don't know.

13
00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:47.770
But there is a debate within the View
community about whether you need Vuex

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.255
with View3 because View3 allows you
to extrapolate reactivity, and so on.

15
00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:57.255
So I have some bonus material in there,
if that interests you in any way,

16
00:00:57.255 --> 00:00:58.710
the exercises are there.

17
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.655
And so yeah, and with that,
thank you so much for attending and

18
00:01:02.655 --> 00:01:05.044
asking questions, and everything.

19
00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:06.874
And yeah, that's all I have.
