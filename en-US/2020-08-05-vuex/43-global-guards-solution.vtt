1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.085
What I will do now is I'm
gonna pull away this.

2
00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:09.080
So I'm just gonna add metadata here.

3
00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:18.148
So I pulled away my navigation guard,
so I'm not using it anymore.

4
00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:25.224
And then I'm gonna create an authRequired:

5
00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:31.361
true to my, Admin screen,

6
00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:37.187
as well as my authRequired screen.

7
00:00:39.117 --> 00:00:45.823
Awesome, so I hooked that up, which means,
hang on, store is not being used.

8
00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:48.714
I'm gonna uncomment the store or
comment out the store for

9
00:00:48.714 --> 00:00:51.553
now, because I wanna make
sure that things are working.

10
00:00:51.553 --> 00:00:56.577
So I pulled out my navigation guard,
which means that I should

11
00:00:56.577 --> 00:01:02.778
at liberty be able to access whatever
I wanna access, which is fair, I can.

12
00:01:02.778 --> 00:01:05.461
And so I'm gonna add that back in.

13
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:09.300
And I'm going to also do,

14
00:01:10.644 --> 00:01:14.803
A check to do router.beforeEach.

15
00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:25.763
And then it runs some code here.

16
00:01:25.763 --> 00:01:31.096
And so I don't have this memorized,

17
00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:35.058
so I'm going to grab this.

18
00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:44.489
So all I'm doing now is I'm checking for
authRequired, and

19
00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.101
then if authRequired, it returns next.

20
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.371
And then the next step is to
also check those getters.

21
00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.471
I think it was, yeah, square brackets.

22
00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:06.131
And then I can do next else

23
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:10.783
it goes to /login.

24
00:02:10.783 --> 00:02:15.846
So this code should make it such that it

25
00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:20.604
automatically reroutes to login.

26
00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:24.926
If I try to go to another page,
like inventory, it kicks me out, so

27
00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:25.942
that's good.

28
00:02:30.548 --> 00:02:32.260
That checks whether a user's logged in.

29
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.449
That was the exercise we did,
I believe, yes.

30
00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.820
And then, of course, the next step is to
sort of hook up the other logic pieces

31
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.454
that we didn't talk about.

32
00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:44.107
I didn't talk about how
exactly to log a user in.

33
00:02:44.107 --> 00:02:48.345
We've just been sort of hard coding
the things, but none of these things work.

34
00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:51.323
So let's change that so that it works.

35
00:02:51.323 --> 00:02:54.823
And for this to work, of course,

36
00:02:54.823 --> 00:03:00.332
you might want to hook into the store and
the router.

37
00:03:00.332 --> 00:03:04.051
So far we looked at the router
accessing the store,

38
00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:08.733
but now what we wanna do is we want
the store to access the router.

39
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:10.642
And the thing with that is,

40
00:03:10.642 --> 00:03:15.544
you can't access the router from
within the store, you just can't.

41
00:03:15.544 --> 00:03:18.910
But there's a way in which you can
have the two talk to one another,

42
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.090
and that's within the component itself.

43
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.950
So let's assume we have
a method called handleLogin.

44
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.438
And we wanted the, handleLogin to dispatch

45
00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:35.544
a login method, and
then push the user to the admin route.

46
00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:38.046
So in this case, it pushes it to slash.

47
00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:41.780
So that's one way in
which we can hook a Vuex,

48
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.317
in this case action,
with a router-specific thing.

49
00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:49.081
So we're gonna dispatch a login.

50
00:03:49.081 --> 00:03:53.431
So what we'll do is we'll
do this.$store.dispatch.

51
00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:56.846
I believe I called it login,

52
00:03:56.846 --> 00:04:01.979
I need to check if it's
log with capital I.

53
00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:07.949
Yes it is, so that's logIn.

54
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:13.318
And then, of course,
we can do something with it.

55
00:04:13.318 --> 00:04:17.829
We don't really care about
the return value, but we want it to,

56
00:04:19.157 --> 00:04:25.516
$router.push.

57
00:04:25.516 --> 00:04:33.645
And so here what we're doing is we're
essentially pushing to the slash itself.

58
00:04:33.645 --> 00:04:36.404
So here in this code that I showed you,

59
00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:40.991
I'm doing a route query to check
where the redirect happened.

60
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:44.508
But for now what we'll do is
we'll just push it to slash.

61
00:04:44.508 --> 00:04:47.919
So that hooks that piece up, I believe.

62
00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.403
I think logIn is already working.

63
00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:55.362
So let's say,

64
00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.209
Password, and if I click Login,

65
00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:05.021
it logs me in automatically.

66
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.524
And then, of course,
this hasn't been hooked up yet, so

67
00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:11.607
it needs to be hooked up,
so let's do that as well.

68
00:05:11.607 --> 00:05:16.105
We're going to look in OperatorView,
you might see this particular logout.

69
00:05:16.105 --> 00:05:21.459
What we'll do here is
we're going to dispatch,

70
00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:26.040
again I need to check if I capitalized it.

71
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.487
I did, [LAUGH] I should just
not second guess myself.

72
00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:35.758
logOut, and then from there,

73
00:05:35.758 --> 00:05:43.874
I'm going to do a push
back to the login screen.

74
00:05:43.874 --> 00:05:48.553
Cuz the assumption is that
the user is no longer logged in.

75
00:05:48.553 --> 00:05:54.280
So from that, if I click,
well I need to refresh.

76
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.596
So let's assume I logged in.

77
00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.665
And I want to log out.

78
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.611
Ta-dah, it logs me out.

79
00:06:08.611 --> 00:06:13.139
So this is one way in which you can have
Vuex and Vue Router talk to one another.

80
00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.300
And that's a really useful aspect in which
we can hook all these different pieces up.
