00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.793
The solution to the exercise is
essentially moving a lot of the state

2
00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:08.250
actions, getters and
mutations into modules.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.170
So we created a module called inventory.

4
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.863
I'll just collapse everything just so
you can see.

5
00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:22.719
In modules, we created an inventory
as well as a machine module.

6
00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:25.171
And then within them, we have states.

7
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:32.056
So here we have, I renamed inventory
to supply, it's basically inventory.

8
00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:36.644
And then we have our getters to
check whether its supply is low.

9
00:00:36.644 --> 00:00:41.270
And then similarly with machine, we
have the aspect of the machine state, So

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.986
the name as well as when it was
last serviced, the condition.

11
00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:48.661
And then we have actions and mutations
that update that as well as a getter.

12
00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.808
And so all of these are modularized.

13
00:00:50.808 --> 00:00:55.108
All we did is we moved all
of our code into a module.

14
00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:59.560
So we essentially modularized our Vuex.

15
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.619
And then within the component, we also
changed how we're accessing things.

16
00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.205
Yeah, we're accessing
the state with the module.

17
00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:11.113
You might notice from this
particular exercise, and

18
00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:17.765
I did not mention this earlier,
that in Vuex, the way how we did things,

19
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:24.328
which is essentially creating a module
as such, so we create a module.

20
00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:29.163
It has state getters, actions and
mutations or whatever.

21
00:01:29.163 --> 00:01:31.713
The problem with this is that
a lot of things are global,

22
00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:33.240
even though it's modularized.

23
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.378
And it might not make sense but,
bear with me for a second, doing it this

24
00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:44.133
way will modularize only the state but
not getters, actions, and mutations.

25
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:47.860
So in order to access the getters,
actions, and mutations,

26
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.518
that's actually global.

27
00:01:49.518 --> 00:01:54.611
So one thing you might notice
is that this.$stores.getters

28
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:59.617
is not namespaced, or
the lowStockItems is not namespaced.

29
00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:04.044
Neither is the serviceDate which
is specifically the getter,

30
00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:06.642
neither is isSupplyLow, and so on.
