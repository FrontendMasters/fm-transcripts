00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
The next piece of what's useful is to look
at other parts of what we can peek into,

2
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.473
because I mentioned that you can
peek into the store as a whole.

3
00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:13.343
So we looked at state and
we looked at mutation.

4
00:00:13.343 --> 00:00:17.827
And oftentimes it's useful to look at
mutations because that's when state

5
00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:19.026
actually changed.

6
00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:22.227
But sometimes you might wanna know
when an action happens as well,

7
00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:25.783
because sometimes an action happens
even though state doesn't change.

8
00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:30.889
You want to know what happened,
and why, maybe why.

9
00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:34.542
And so what you can do is,
you can actually call subscribe action.

10
00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:37.917
So store has a method call
subscribe action, and

11
00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:40.974
it takes in an action
as the first argument.

12
00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:44.845
So, just to go back to show you
what the previous code was,

13
00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.647
because I think it's useful to
see sort of a side by side.

14
00:00:48.647 --> 00:00:52.869
Previously, when you're looking
at a mutation, you would just do

15
00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:58.141
store.subscribe to get a mutation, and
then you use the mutation appropriately.

16
00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.983
But in our instance,
we are accessing the action.

17
00:01:01.983 --> 00:01:05.357
And to access action,
you can't do store.subscribe,

18
00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:07.827
you have to do store.subscribe action.

19
00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:11.796
And that will give you the specific
action, and very similar to mutation,

20
00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.385
you get access to the type
as well as the payload.

21
00:01:14.385 --> 00:01:20.436
So you can use them however you choose,
very similar to what we did before.

22
00:01:20.436 --> 00:01:24.151
And there are properties that
are accessible on the action.

23
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:29.441
So the next exercise that we'll work on,
is to modify our subscribe,

24
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:35.192
to use a subscribe action, so that we
can see how exactly that can be useful.

25
00:01:35.192 --> 00:01:39.118
We'll keep, essentially when I say modify,
I mean just add subscribe action,

26
00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:41.496
so you don't have to remove
what you had before.

27
00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:43.283
We're just gonna add something separate.
