00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.956
So the next exercise that will work on is
to look at the code that we have so far.

2
00:00:05.956 --> 00:00:09.566
And we're gonna grab instead
of using context directly,

3
00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.635
we're going to destructure it.

4
00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:14.944
Which means that we're
gonna create an object and

5
00:00:14.944 --> 00:00:20.322
then we're gonna use the specific pieces
of it that we will need in our mutation.
