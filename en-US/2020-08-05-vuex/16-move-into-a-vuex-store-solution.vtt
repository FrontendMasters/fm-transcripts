WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.837
So I will check out to that
particular branch because step

2
00:00:04.837 --> 00:00:08.075
one already has everything working.

3
00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:12.095
I'm gonna just get the project up and
running so that we see what we're

4
00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:16.265
working with first cuz it's nice to
be able to at least have some visual.

5
00:00:16.265 --> 00:00:18.414
You can also do NPM run serve.

6
00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:22.040
I use yarn specifically
because I enjoy that process.

7
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.012
But this is very similar to what we
had earlier we have like a restock,

8
00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:30.123
and we have a dispense with loading state.

9
00:00:30.123 --> 00:00:35.187
And so what we wanna do is we
want to be able to move the store

10
00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:39.737
out from our component into
the store code itself.

11
00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:44.266
So if you look at store/index.js
which I used vcli.

12
00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:47.720
And so it created an index.js and
a store folder,

13
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.353
which is why you have the structure but

14
00:00:50.353 --> 00:00:55.712
again if you want to you can create
store.js sort of independent if you want.

15
00:00:55.712 --> 00:01:00.360
So my store file is empty at the moment
my main.js file should be empty,

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.473
well actually it doesn't matter if it
lives there because the store is empty,

17
00:01:05.473 --> 00:01:08.977
so it's just importing an empty store so
it's fine.

18
00:01:08.977 --> 00:01:13.310
And my store code, all of it lives
in my component at the moment.

19
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.970
So if I scroll up to
the top of my component,

20
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.385
I'll see all this extra code with
even this Vue.use and so on.

21
00:01:22.385 --> 00:01:27.121
So let's remove that because we no
longer need it to live in our component.

22
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:29.549
So we're gonna just
delete that all together.

23
00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.538
And then what we'll do is I'm just
gonna grab from the fake API call all

24
00:01:34.538 --> 00:01:38.616
the way to the end of my stall
where the xbot.default is.

25
00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:43.283
And then this is gonna
create some extra like fun

26
00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:46.907
stuff because of the way I copied it.

27
00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:50.090
I should have copied the inside of it,
but I will do that now.

28
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.234
Let me grab that.

29
00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:54.655
So now I have an empty store.

30
00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:55.880
I'm gonna remove it.

31
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.505
And I'm just gonna update the internals
of this with my store like such.

32
00:02:05.212 --> 00:02:05.712
That should work.

33
00:02:05.712 --> 00:02:06.918
Yes.

34
00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:09.998
So that works as expected and so

35
00:02:09.998 --> 00:02:15.338
essentially what I did is I
moved to using Vuex Store.

36
00:02:15.338 --> 00:02:17.994
I will show you the DevTools.

37
00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:22.951
So I'm using Vue DevTools here because
I like to be able to see how exactly my

38
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:27.693
state is changing, what actions and
what mutations are being called.

39
00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:32.817
So I'll give you a quick rundown of
what exactly the DevTools look like.

40
00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:38.738
And then we're gonna be living
mostly in the Vuex tab of this.

41
00:02:38.738 --> 00:02:42.974
And so if you're looking at the,
this is my screen, and

42
00:02:42.974 --> 00:02:49.123
you'll see the DevTools to the right,
you'll see each individual component.

43
00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:52.968
So currently I didn't componentize because
in this example it didn't quite matter.

44
00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:56.827
So we have one single component,
which is the view layer, you see,

45
00:02:56.827 --> 00:03:00.362
you see the computer properties and
then you see data as well.

46
00:03:00.362 --> 00:03:05.354
And so what I want to show you
is this next tab which has

47
00:03:05.354 --> 00:03:10.363
this sort of loading icon,
and that is the Vuex tab.

48
00:03:10.363 --> 00:03:14.557
So in the Vuex tab,
you'll see things changing and updating.

49
00:03:14.557 --> 00:03:17.513
So here if I click dispense,

50
00:03:17.513 --> 00:03:22.570
you should see that
dispense being dispatched.

51
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.286
And then you'll see it as mutation.

52
00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.044
So generally Vuex will show you mutations.

53
00:03:28.044 --> 00:03:30.576
Because the mutation
actually touches the state.

54
00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:35.073
And then it says recording
state on demand.

55
00:03:35.073 --> 00:03:37.492
So it doesn't show you
the state automatically.

56
00:03:37.492 --> 00:03:41.215
But if you want to see the state,
you can click the load state button and

57
00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:43.821
it shows you all of
the information associated.

58
00:03:43.821 --> 00:03:46.180
So you see things change in real time,

59
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.321
you can see the specific mutations
that are being called and so on.

60
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:54.790
So the DevTools are really useful as
you're working through exercises because

61
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.325
it gives you a sense of what's
happening in your application,

62
00:03:58.325 --> 00:04:00.878
and it's a really good
tool to debug as well.

63
00:04:00.878 --> 00:04:05.473
And it allows you to also like
explicitly change state if you want it

64
00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:08.686
to check how your UI was looking like and
so on.
