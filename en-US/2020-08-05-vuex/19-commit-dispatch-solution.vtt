00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:05.879
So the next exercise that we'll work on is
to look at the code that we have so far.

2
00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.408
And we're gonna grab instead
of using context directly,

3
00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:11.433
we're going to destructure it.

4
00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.031
Which means that we're
gonna create an object, and

5
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:20.613
then we're gonna use the specific pieces
of it that we will need in our mutation.

6
00:00:20.613 --> 00:00:24.960
In this particular exercise,
I hope it was fairly straightforward.

7
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.848
We didn't add any extra code.

8
00:00:26.848 --> 00:00:31.814
All we did was update the existing code,
and it doesn't really do anything.

9
00:00:31.814 --> 00:00:34.070
It just makes it a bit more clean.

10
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.414
So let's just go over
what that looks like.

11
00:00:37.414 --> 00:00:42.641
So, I'm specifically, and
the exercise specifically asked for

12
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.824
you to destructure the context object.

13
00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:51.204
Which is available on the actions,
default parameter that actions get.

14
00:00:51.204 --> 00:00:55.725
So, all you have to do is you're
just instead of using context,

15
00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:59.003
you're just grabbing commit specifically.

16
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:03.901
And then all you do next
is you grab every instance

17
00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:08.572
of context.commit in that specific action.

18
00:01:08.572 --> 00:01:10.281
And then you change it appropriately.

19
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:14.337
And then you would iterate through every
single instance, and change it as such.

20
00:01:14.337 --> 00:01:17.318
And then that's a really simple way,
so it's a bit cleaner.

21
00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:21.137
Rather than having to chain like
context.commit is a bit ugly, and

22
00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:22.881
not very readable sometimes.

23
00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.475
And I automatically look at my action, and

24
00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.221
I know that I'm only
committing a mutation.

25
00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:31.001
I'm not checking state,
I'm not checking ghettos, and so on.
