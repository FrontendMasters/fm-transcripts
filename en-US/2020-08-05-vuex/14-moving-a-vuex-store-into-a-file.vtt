1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.194
So we'll review what our vuex
looks like in a vue instance.

2
00:00:04.194 --> 00:00:08.082
Just so that you see where we started
from and where we're moving towards.

3
00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:11.842
So here from line 1 to 10,
we have our store so

4
00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:16.834
we instantiate the store and
we create this concept of a store.

5
00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.830
So in this case, it's a constant.

6
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.990
And then on line 14 is where we pass
that store to our vue instance.

7
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.870
And our vue instance
here is pretty isolated.

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.776
Isolated in the sense that
it's only used once and

9
00:00:28.776 --> 00:00:33.419
you can't use it anywhere else because
it's not really reusable in this case.

10
00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:36.199
But we want to move to
a state where our store and

11
00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:39.061
our vue instance don't
live in the same place.

12
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:40.710
So what does that look like?

13
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.371
Before I show you the code I want to
show you the folder structure just so

14
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:49.170
you understand where things
live relative to the other.

15
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.355
So when you look at the folder structure,
you have a concept of source.

16
00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:57.261
And the source is where all of the files
that you're actually gonna be changing and

17
00:00:57.261 --> 00:00:58.061
updating live.

18
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:02.903
And so we have components you have
app.vue file, you have main.js and

19
00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:05.816
then you have this file called store.js.

20
00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:09.891
Within the vue CLI,
this is obviously up to preference.

21
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:14.682
If you use vue CLI and
you add vuex through vue CLI,

22
00:01:14.682 --> 00:01:22.120
generally what happens is that you get
a store folder instead of a store file.

23
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.875
So it will be store as a folder and
then within store it has an index js file.

24
00:01:27.875 --> 00:01:30.660
So that's what you'll see if you vue CLI.

25
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.597
But again, It's up to you as to how
you want to organize your store.

26
00:01:34.597 --> 00:01:39.358
And as we progress through the day
I'll show you the different ways in

27
00:01:39.358 --> 00:01:42.738
which I use vuex and
my store just for reference.

28
00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:46.736
So the store.js is where
we'll be storing and

29
00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:50.643
adding all the store specific information.

30
00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:54.891
And we obviously,
want to add that to our vue component and

31
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:56.982
the application as a whole.

32
00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:01.665
If you've used vue before, you might
be familiar that main.js is where

33
00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:05.912
the nuts and bolts of where your
vue is instantiated and created.

34
00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:09.640
So you can pass in plugins you can
pass in all sorts of things to it.

35
00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.781
In this case, we're gonna be passing
the store to our main.js file.

36
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:21.298
So main.js will import the store,
which is created on the left.

37
00:02:21.298 --> 00:02:25.480
It imports that separately as ./store.

38
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.454
And then you're passing
that to your vue instance.

39
00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:33.944
Line 7 to 10 isn't too different
from the CodePen example cuz you

40
00:02:33.944 --> 00:02:37.264
are instantiating vue and
then adding the store.

41
00:02:37.264 --> 00:02:41.944
But it's a bit different because there's a
render context and there's a mount and so

42
00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:45.003
it's sort of single-file
components specific code.

43
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:48.458
But what I want you to take away from this
is that you can have a store.js file.

44
00:02:48.458 --> 00:02:52.564
And then you can have a main.js file and
those two have to talk to each other in

45
00:02:52.564 --> 00:02:55.341
order for
your entire app to know that vuex exists.

46
00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:59.200
So you're importing vuex
as you see on line 2,

47
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.066
you have to import it and
then you have to use it.
