00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.922
I'll send you off to do your
first exercise unassisted.

2
00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:08.751
And in this particular exercise,
all I want you to do is in the fetch from

3
00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:14.308
inventory action, I want you to
dispatch a call to the next action.

4
00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:21.132
And for this, we're going to be using and
moving into another folder.

5
00:00:21.132 --> 00:00:23.057
Again, we're using submodules here.

6
00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:25.220
But I'll show you how exactly to navigate.

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.528
So it's called vuex-compose-actions.

8
00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:32.644
So if I'm in my front-end
masters main code,

9
00:00:32.644 --> 00:00:36.772
I can sort of CD into
that specific directory.

10
00:00:36.772 --> 00:00:41.054
And you should be starting
from step zero and

11
00:00:41.054 --> 00:00:45.914
step zero will give you
just a very clean sense of,

12
00:00:45.914 --> 00:00:51.719
you'll see your store and
you'll see actions to actions.

13
00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.098
And you'll see some
comments as well with some

14
00:00:56.098 --> 00:01:00.372
helpers as to how exactly
to write your code.
