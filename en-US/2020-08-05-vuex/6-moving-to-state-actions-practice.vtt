00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.096
Our next exercise is again, just doing
the exact same thing we did earlier,

2
00:00:04.096 --> 00:00:06.656
except we're doing it for
the restock method.

3
00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:10.478
So similar to what you did with dispense,
you're taking that restock method.

4
00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:14.938
And you're adding an action, and mutation,
and then you're dispatching the action.

5
00:00:14.938 --> 00:00:20.658
For this particular exercise, I hope
that that was fairly straightforward.

6
00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:24.231
But we're gonna go over it together
very similar to what we did before, but

7
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:25.319
slightly different.

8
00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.894
I'll live coded just so

9
00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:31.152
that you actually see the steps
that I'm going through to do it.

10
00:00:31.152 --> 00:00:33.842
And then if you haven't done it or
you still need to take your time,

11
00:00:33.842 --> 00:00:34.960
feel free to follow along.

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.545
I have a restock method and
I want it to dispatch a specific action.

13
00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:47.832
So I'm gonna do this .$store.dispatch.

14
00:00:47.832 --> 00:00:50.055
And then I'm calling restock.

15
00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:56.743
And then let me go up to my action,
and I'm gonna create a restock action.

16
00:00:56.743 --> 00:00:59.356
It takes in a default context.

17
00:00:59.356 --> 00:01:03.881
I'm gonna commit that particular stock.

18
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:07.599
So I'm gonna commit that mutation and

19
00:01:07.599 --> 00:01:12.139
then now I need to create
the mutation itself.

20
00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:16.829
So it's just doing equals 40.

21
00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.135
So all it's doing now is just
essentially restocking back to 40.

22
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:26.105
So let's see if that works.

23
00:01:26.105 --> 00:01:31.405
It's always a gamble, so obviously
restock can't be restocked if you're 40.

24
00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:33.609
I disabled that cuz it
doesn't make sense for

25
00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:36.164
you to click that button
if it's already at the top.

26
00:01:36.164 --> 00:01:39.269
So I'm gonna dispense a bit which
frees up that particular button, and

27
00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:41.093
then when I click restock, it restocks.

28
00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:42.374
So it works, great.

29
00:01:42.374 --> 00:01:43.256
Congratulations.

30
00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:47.001
This is your first introduction to UX.

31
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:53.825
And using UX, and using a store,
dispatching actions, committing mutations.
