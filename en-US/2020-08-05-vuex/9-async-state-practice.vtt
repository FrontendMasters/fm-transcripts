00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
We'll dive into our first example
which is sort of a work around,

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.125
like an extra example from earlier.

3
00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.732
Where we're creating
isRestocking state within Vuex,

4
00:00:10.732 --> 00:00:13.144
that gets toggled on fish inventory.

5
00:00:13.144 --> 00:00:18.136
We talked about how exactly we want to
hook up the isRestocking states into

6
00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:22.743
our component, and how we want that
action in the mutation to look.

7
00:00:22.743 --> 00:00:28.475
And so in order to do that, we created
an isRestocking sort of a computer

8
00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:34.027
property from the Frontend because
we want that state to be updated.

9
00:00:34.027 --> 00:00:36.694
And the computer property
is called isRestocking, and

10
00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.974
then we're just checking
the specific state.

11
00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:43.535
So this .dollarStore.state isRestocking,
and that is of course, a boolean property.

12
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:48.596
So if you go back up to the action itself,
or to the state itself.

13
00:00:48.596 --> 00:00:52.780
We created a state called isRestocking,
in this case, it's false.

14
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.729
And then we have this fetch
inventory API that we're, or

15
00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:02.838
this fetch inventory action in which we're
pinging inventory, which is the API call.

16
00:01:02.838 --> 00:01:05.115
And then before we make the API call,

17
00:01:05.115 --> 00:01:08.428
we want to commit to change
the isRestocking to true.

18
00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:15.321
And then when the async action finishes,
we want to change that back to false.

19
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:19.904
And then the mutation itself
will emulate that, so

20
00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:22.897
it takes in a state and a payload.

21
00:01:22.897 --> 00:01:27.498
And then we are changing that isRestocking
back to whatever the payload i,s so

22
00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:28.408
true or false.

23
00:01:28.408 --> 00:01:31.743
And so that's essentially what that
looks like with everything hooked up.
