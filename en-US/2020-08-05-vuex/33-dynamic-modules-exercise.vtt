00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.615
We're gonna move to the first exercise,

2
00:00:02.615 --> 00:00:05.762
which is looking at
the operatorView component.

3
00:00:05.762 --> 00:00:09.481
Extrapolating the store and
dynamically loading it, so

4
00:00:09.481 --> 00:00:11.811
that the servicing of the machine.

5
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.968
So what you see on the bottom basically,
that's what I called the operatorView.

6
00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:17.054
I'll show you.

7
00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:20.505
So if you look at components,

8
00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:26.449
you'll see the view on the bottom,
essentially.

9
00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.208
So these are all items.

10
00:00:28.208 --> 00:00:31.007
This bottom part is
what I'm talking about.

11
00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:33.514
So I wanna focus on this specific button.

12
00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:35.786
So it's the bottom,
I call the operatorView.

13
00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:37.159
It's just a component name.

14
00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:39.464
And so what I want you to do
is extrapolate the store.

15
00:00:39.464 --> 00:00:44.443
And dynamically load it in that specific
component such that the other machines

16
00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:45.566
are not updated.

17
00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:50.213
One thing to note with this particular
exercise, you are gonna get console

18
00:00:50.213 --> 00:00:55.023
errors because of the way in which you
are accessing and creating the module.

19
00:00:55.023 --> 00:00:58.538
And that's because the other
parts of components is gonna

20
00:00:58.538 --> 00:01:01.418
require the piece that
you're modularizing.

21
00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:04.656
But in subsequent exercises,
we're gonna fix those console errors.

22
00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:07.229
So, ignore some of them for now, and

23
00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.804
then as we work through it,
we'll actually work to remove them.

24
00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:16.354
And for this exercise, we're gonna be
working off of this specific folder,

25
00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:19.798
which is the vuex static versus
dynamic modules folders.

26
00:01:19.798 --> 00:01:25.403
So if I were to jump into
that specific folder,

27
00:01:25.403 --> 00:01:29.007
I'll be pushed to step zero.

28
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:34.253
And then from there I can work
my way up to this exercise.
