1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.864
So you might notice, [LAUGH] as I
mentioned that you have getters and

2
00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:07.114
actions and
various other pieces in addition to state.

3
00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:12.553
So the state works for modularizing
things but not for actions and getters.

4
00:00:12.553 --> 00:00:17.662
And that's because in vuex,
modules only work as modules and

5
00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.984
are only namespaced if you
tell it to namespaces, so

6
00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:24.848
it automatically namespaces it.

7
00:00:24.848 --> 00:00:29.183
If it states specific but
it doesn't namespace for actions and

8
00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:32.945
getters, it automatically
gets added to the global.

9
00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:37.436
So in order to access it,
even though it's within the module,

10
00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:39.904
is still on the global namespace.

11
00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:44.551
Does that make sense, okay, cool.

12
00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:47.281
&gt;&gt; So
you should make sure your actions and

13
00:00:47.281 --> 00:00:52.586
getters ditcher getters from different
modules don't have the same name?

14
00:00:52.586 --> 00:00:56.864
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so the question was
that considering this, and

15
00:00:56.864 --> 00:01:02.351
the fact that actions and mutations and
getters are not namespaced and

16
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:07.280
are global, you might want to make
sure that the naming of all of

17
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.755
them are unique to the module or
unique across the board.

18
00:01:11.755 --> 00:01:13.307
So, for example,

19
00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:18.943
you might have a restock in one module
in a restock in another module.

20
00:01:18.943 --> 00:01:23.965
That will cause a namespace clash,
and that's sort of one of the problems

21
00:01:23.965 --> 00:01:29.560
of using vuex modules, and we'll look at
a solution to that in just a minute here.

22
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.250
And so I wanna just show how
exactly to access things.

23
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.951
So with vuex helpers,

24
00:01:36.951 --> 00:01:42.961
again vuex helpers is specifically a
pattern that is vary based on preference.

25
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:45.291
Some people really don't like it, but

26
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.544
I thought I'd show it just to
show you what I mean here.

27
00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:52.107
So if you used the getters and
actions in a module, again,

28
00:01:52.107 --> 00:01:54.145
it's not namespace its global.

29
00:01:54.145 --> 00:01:56.423
If you were to use your vuex modules,

30
00:01:56.423 --> 00:02:00.254
one thing to note is that you
are still accessing it globally.

31
00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:04.388
So you're just grabbing like map
actions is a giant array, and

32
00:02:04.388 --> 00:02:07.357
then you grab all
the actions specific to it.

33
00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:09.853
So even though they are modularized,

34
00:02:09.853 --> 00:02:14.223
they're still in the global namespace,
just a quick note there.

35
00:02:14.223 --> 00:02:17.394
And so
one thing to know to circumvent this so

36
00:02:17.394 --> 00:02:22.624
that everything is namespaced is to
add the namespaced true attribute,

37
00:02:22.624 --> 00:02:27.696
and this is explicitly telling vuex
to always namespace your module.

38
00:02:27.696 --> 00:02:31.323
I know it sounds counter intuitive
that a module should be namespace.

39
00:02:31.323 --> 00:02:35.944
But I think the idea here is that
you are explicitly making sure and

40
00:02:35.944 --> 00:02:40.984
making space for all of those actions,
mutations and getters to live as

41
00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:46.714
separate modules, so they're not on
the global namespace they are localized.

42
00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:51.072
So with that you can actually
access them specifically.

43
00:02:51.072 --> 00:02:55.790
So namespaced true is sort of
the kicker of what you need here.

44
00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.754
And so with namespaced true,
we can now actually access our actions and

45
00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:03.911
getters and so on,
on the module namespace.

46
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:08.581
So, again, the way we access state
hasn't changed, because previously

47
00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:12.823
without the namespace true,
you could still access it as a module.

48
00:03:12.823 --> 00:03:16.673
But the thing that changes is
how you dispatch your actions.

49
00:03:16.673 --> 00:03:21.518
So on line 25 and 28,
I'm specifically dispatching fetch from

50
00:03:21.518 --> 00:03:25.009
inventory which is on
the inventory namespace.

51
00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:30.272
And then similarly, on line 28,
I'm dispatching serviceMachine,

52
00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:32.871
which is on the machine namespace.

53
00:03:32.871 --> 00:03:37.641
And so, on the namespace true is the
solution and is the thing you need if you

54
00:03:37.641 --> 00:03:41.202
really want to make sure that
your actions, getters and

55
00:03:41.202 --> 00:03:46.458
mutations follow this modularized pattern,
so you're telling vuex to do that.

56
00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:51.358
And so, the next exercise that we're gonna
do is we're just gonna namespace our vuex

57
00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:55.526
module, and then update all of our
actions and getters appropriately.

58
00:03:55.526 --> 00:04:01.256
And so with that,
we'll dive into the solution.

59
00:04:01.256 --> 00:04:08.122
All right, so the solution here is
we're trying to namespace our modules.

60
00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:12.523
And so what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna do namespace true,

61
00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:14.824
I think it's with the d, yes.

62
00:04:14.824 --> 00:04:20.407
And then I'm gonna find my machine, and
I'm just also gonna do the same thing.

63
00:04:20.407 --> 00:04:25.267
Which I'm gonna make sure and so
with this, it actually makes sure that

64
00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:30.136
every single module, so machine
inventory in this case is namespace.

65
00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:34.122
And so with this namespace,
we can now update our component so

66
00:04:34.122 --> 00:04:37.035
that it is appropriately
namespace as well.

67
00:04:37.035 --> 00:04:39.718
So obviously our state doesn't change,

68
00:04:39.718 --> 00:04:45.110
because state doesn't really change in
any way, but I'm gonna update my getter.

69
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.789
And so low stock items,
I believe is under inventory.

70
00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.059
And so, I'm accessing low stock

71
00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:59.642
items on the inventory namespace.

72
00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:02.766
Again, this is like, getter specific code.

73
00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:11.182
And then similarly, I'm also accessing
this which is on the machine namespace.

74
00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:15.382
So my getter will look at
the machine namespace and

75
00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:18.884
then find the specific getter within it.

76
00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:22.489
And then here I also wanna update that.

77
00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:25.480
So is supplyLow is on inventory.

78
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.003
And lastly I need to check that this

79
00:05:31.003 --> 00:05:37.097
is on the machine namespace is machine

80
00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:43.198
working is on the machine namespace.

81
00:05:43.198 --> 00:05:47.635
And then lastly, I also need to
make sure I'm dispatching properly,

82
00:05:47.635 --> 00:05:52.451
because currently dispatches dispatching
directly to serviceMachine but

83
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:55.551
I need to dispatch
specifically on that module.

84
00:05:55.551 --> 00:06:02.736
And so, I believe that's covered,
most of it, yes.

85
00:06:02.736 --> 00:06:06.209
Let's see if work [LAUGH] my gosh.

86
00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:08.831
Yay, it worked hurray, okay.

87
00:06:08.831 --> 00:06:14.392
So, that's essentially how you
move two namespace modules.

88
00:06:14.392 --> 00:06:19.318
Let's see what that looks like in
DevTools, just so that you get a sense of

89
00:06:19.318 --> 00:06:23.783
like how exactly things look like
from the DevTools perspective.

90
00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.814
So I'm gonna load state.

91
00:06:25.814 --> 00:06:32.629
And so, now within state you'll see that
you have this thing called inventory and

92
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:37.565
machine, like you no longer
have sort of a global state, so

93
00:06:37.565 --> 00:06:40.758
to speak, everything is namespace.

94
00:06:40.758 --> 00:06:44.655
So state has an inventory
object as well as a machine

95
00:06:44.655 --> 00:06:49.470
object,getters is supplyLow
item as well as machine object.

96
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.675
Well, a machine object and
then this should be namespace but

97
00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:55.824
I guess it wasn't moved over.

98
00:06:55.824 --> 00:07:00.577
So the idea here is that now we have
this namespaced true attribute, so

99
00:07:00.577 --> 00:07:02.439
our supply is namespaced.

100
00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:05.698
Obviously state doesn't change much,
but the getters does.

101
00:07:05.698 --> 00:07:10.193
So this particular getter is specific
to that machine namespaced, so

102
00:07:10.193 --> 00:07:12.488
you can't access it outside of it.

103
00:07:12.488 --> 00:07:19.371
So that is the first step to using and
namespacing our vuex modules,

104
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:24.100
which fixes a lot of
the issues we had earlier.

105
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:28.339
Where state was the only thing that was
namespaced and not actions, getters and

106
00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:29.043
mutations.

107
00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:35.065
So adding the namespace true is one way to
making sure that you can fix this problem.
