00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.975
This is intro to state
management with Vuex.

2
00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:07.125
In this course, we'll go over
introductory Vuex concepts and

3
00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.806
then we'll work our way
through more advanced things.

4
00:00:10.806 --> 00:00:13.859
But before moving forward,
my name is Divya.

5
00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:18.325
I'm a developer experience engineer
at a company called Netlify.

6
00:00:18.325 --> 00:00:21.890
And I am on twitter @shortdiv
if that's your thing.

7
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.387
And I'm really excited to teach you
this workshop because I really love Vue.

8
00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:27.812
It's a framework that I use quite often.

9
00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:34.016
And Vuex is obviously the state
management choice for when you use Vue.

10
00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:39.316
Before we begin, we have a couple of
things that I wanted to just show you.

11
00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:41.436
So for this particular course,

12
00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:45.410
all of the slides as well as
the code is available on GitHub.

13
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.987
So if you go to this particular link,

14
00:00:47.987 --> 00:00:52.566
which is
github.com/shortdiv/frontend-masters-vuex,

15
00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:57.571
that has all the slides, all the code and
exercises we're going over.

16
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:02.133
As well as some resources that will be
useful for you like Vue CLI, which is

17
00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:07.005
something that I use Vue Dev tools as
well, which is inspector tools and so on.

18
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.832
And you can find a lot of this that
I refer to like the code tools within

19
00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:13.620
the GitHub repo as well.

20
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.474
So, for this particular course, I'll be
using a mixture of Codepen and VS Code.

21
00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:23.649
I put Code Sandbox in there,
I won't be using it much, but

22
00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.313
some of the code that I show
will be on Code Sandbox,

23
00:01:27.313 --> 00:01:31.854
just as a way of showing you what
it looks like at the end result.

24
00:01:31.854 --> 00:01:36.733
Cool, so as I mentioned, this is an intro
to Vuex course but I'm also kind of

25
00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:41.487
diving deeper towards the end of
the course into more advanced concepts.

26
00:01:41.487 --> 00:01:43.916
But here's a high level of
what we're gonna go over.

27
00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:45.900
We're gonna cover
the fundamentals of Vuex.

28
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.977
So what is state management,
why you would use Vuex.

29
00:01:48.977 --> 00:01:52.792
And then we'll dive further
into how you use Vuex and

30
00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:56.703
Vue, so
particularly with single file components.

31
00:01:56.703 --> 00:02:00.604
And then we will use Vue
with Vuex with Vue Router.

32
00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:04.574
We'll use modules, we'll do plugins,
we'll normalize state and

33
00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:06.703
then we'll also like compose Vuex.

34
00:02:06.703 --> 00:02:08.370
So using actions and so on.
