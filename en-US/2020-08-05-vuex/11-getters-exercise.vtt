00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.192
In the example I showed you, we looked at
a Getter, which is essentially checking

2
00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:07.493
the state, to make sure the state
doesn't fall below a number.

3
00:00:07.493 --> 00:00:12.041
So in the code I showed you, I'm
checking to make sure that the state, or

4
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:14.741
the supply state doesn't fall below ten.

5
00:00:14.741 --> 00:00:19.203
And if it does fall below ten,
it gives you this caution icon, and

6
00:00:19.203 --> 00:00:21.160
I'm doing that via Getter.

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.963
And so this is the code that I showed
you again, just for refresher,

8
00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:28.841
I created a Getter called is supply low.

9
00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:34.242
And then in my computed, I'm hooking that
up with this.$store.getters.iSupplyLow.

10
00:00:34.242 --> 00:00:39.108
And so that's a really useful example, but
we'll look at a different example, just so

11
00:00:39.108 --> 00:00:41.895
that we can solidify this
concept slightly more.

12
00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:45.019
So let's assume that we have
the same application, and

13
00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.279
we wanted to change the language in which,
we are displaying information.

14
00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:54.224
So right now we have information
that's by default in English, but

15
00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:57.965
let's say we want to switch it so
it's in Espanol.

16
00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:01.564
So we can click a button in
the top right corner, and

17
00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:05.348
it switches automatically
from English to Spanish.

18
00:01:05.348 --> 00:01:10.352
And that is useful via Getter,
because let's assume we have all

19
00:01:10.352 --> 00:01:16.018
of the translations in state, or
somewhere else that we wanna store it.

20
00:01:16.018 --> 00:01:19.605
We want to be able to toggle
the specific language in which,

21
00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:23.566
we're showing information and
then use a Getter using that way.

22
00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:28.584
I'll explain specifically what I mean,
in this particular exercise.

23
00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:33.517
For this, we're going to switch out the
language, so we handle everything in Vuex.

24
00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:35.942
And I'll go into
the exercise specifically.

25
00:01:35.942 --> 00:01:40.159
So I show you where everything
is in the moving parts, so

26
00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.590
you can deal with them
within the app itself.

27
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.581
So what I've given you is I've given you,
an object called translations.

28
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:50.626
It has English and Spanish within them, so

29
00:01:50.626 --> 00:01:56.642
there's various ways in which you can
translate, but it's just one giant object.

30
00:01:56.642 --> 00:02:01.726
And then what I want you to do is, I want
you to be able to change the language

31
00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:06.492
selected, so language selected now
in state is by default English.

32
00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:09.935
And we're going to hook up an action and
a mutation,

33
00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:14.723
that changes this specific language
selected from English to Spanish.
