00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.314
So for the first exercise in which we're
moving to a single file components,

2
00:00:05.314 --> 00:00:08.667
we're gonna essentially
take our vuex store and

3
00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.119
move it into a separate,
single file component.

4
00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.222
One thing to know as we move through this
exercise is that the GitHub repo for

5
00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:22.249
frontend masters has various folders
within it with with the exercises.

6
00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:26.394
So you may notice that vuex-sfc
is a subfolder within that,

7
00:00:26.394 --> 00:00:28.435
it's actually a submodule.

8
00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:33.220
So I have a separate repo in which
that lives which is this link, but

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.160
it is submoduled and
I'll show you what I mean by that.

10
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.295
So here I am actually checked into
my frontend masters vuex repo and

11
00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:46.429
you can see that there
are various folders within it.

12
00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:52.366
From your perspective, you don't really
have to think about submodules but

13
00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:57.296
you can see that the vuex-sfc is there so
I can easily just cd into

14
00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:02.253
that directory and
I'm automatically checked into step-0.

15
00:01:02.253 --> 00:01:07.750
And so what you're trying to do is
that the store has nothing in it and

16
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.675
if you go here there is store
specific code in the component.

17
00:01:12.675 --> 00:01:18.015
So you'll see cons.store in
vending machine admin.view,

18
00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:25.106
we're moving that code into the store and
then linking the Store App in main.js.
