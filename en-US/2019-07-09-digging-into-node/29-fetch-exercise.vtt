00:00:00.054 --> 00:00:01.508
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We're good
with the server for right now.

2
00:00:01.508 --> 00:00:07.390
Let's switch over to our Ex5 web js file.

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.190
I filled some of this out for you, but
you're gonna do a little part of this.

4
00:00:13.047 --> 00:00:16.960
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The getRecords function,
that's gonna be called.

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.853
It's already linked up
with a click handler.

6
00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:22.940
That's gonna be called when that
button on the page gets called.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.598
And what you need to do is make a fetch
request to our server endpoint.

8
00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:31.238
Remember how we were doing fetch before

9
00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:35.994
with,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If you haven't used fetch

10
00:00:35.994 --> 00:00:39.000
before, it looks like this,
where you give it a url.

11
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.042
And you can await the response
from the url, and

12
00:00:44.042 --> 00:00:47.193
then await the JSON on that response.

13
00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:53.297
And once you've got the JSON, you should
be able to pass it to renderRecords,

14
00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:57.140
which will produce some inner HTML for
you.

15
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.877
It'll produce the inner HTML
to print it to the screen.

16
00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:04.370
This is basically like our console.table
that we did in the previous exercise.

17
00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:11.428
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So try your hand
at writing this fetch code to

18
00:01:11.428 --> 00:01:15.440
grab the JSON data from our endpoint.
