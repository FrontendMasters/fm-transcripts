00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.860
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The first thing that
we wanna do is decide whether or

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.580
not the other that we have been provided
is already in the database or not.

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.560
If it's not, we need to insert it.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.430
If it is we need to get its ID.

5
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.891
So I'm gonna make a function
that's called insertOrLookup,

6
00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:27.544
we'll call it insertOrLookupOther.

7
00:00:29.218 --> 00:00:31.510
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, and
we wanna pass the other value in.

8
00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.000
And this is gonna be an asynchronous
operation, so we wanna await on it.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.710
And the thing that we're gonna
be getting back is the otherID.

10
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.246
So the ID of that record
in the other table,

11
00:00:44.246 --> 00:00:48.262
whether we had to make a new record,
or whether we just looked it up,

12
00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:51.166
that's what insertOrLookupOther
is gonna do.

13
00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:59.060
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So let's define,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: An async

14
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.966
function called
insertOrLookupOther(other).

15
00:01:08.447 --> 00:01:10.840
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What we're
going to do is use the SQL3.

16
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.600
And because we're trying
to do a lookup first,

17
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.300
we wanna use the get command which
would return us a single record.

18
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.030
If we need to get multiple records,
we use all.

19
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.080
If we wanna do an insert updated delete,
we use run.

20
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.260
So basically get is
the thing we wanna use.

21
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:34.852
We're gonna call,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: SQL3.get,

22
00:01:34.852 --> 00:01:41.600
and we're gonna be awaiting this
because again it's a promise.

23
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.420
We're gonna call .get, and
we wanna give it a string of SQL.

24
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.240
And I'm gonna use the back tick string so

25
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.310
that I can spread my SQL
across multiple lines.

26
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.503
You can use whatever kind of
string works for you, but

27
00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:55.465
I'm gonna spread them
across multiple lines.

28
00:01:56.842 --> 00:02:01.101
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So, the first thing that
we wanna do is Lookup to see whether Other

29
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:03.395
is already in our other table.

30
00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:04.805
If it is, we just need the ID.

31
00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:06.605
So we're gonna do SELECT id.

32
00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:14.970
If we look at our schema,
that's the name of our primary key.

33
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.065
I'm gonna SELECT id FROM Other, WHERE,

34
00:02:20.065 --> 00:02:24.886
and then the value here is called data.

35
00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:29.060
So WHERE data =?

36
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.840
And the way you give a placeholder for

37
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.250
values that'll be interpolated in SQL
lights API is use a question mark.

38
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.850
You do not need to do any of
the escaping like escaping or

39
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.030
putting quotes around stuff.

40
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.430
It handles all that for you.

41
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.880
So you just put a placeholder any place
that you're gonna interpolate a value in.

42
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.950
And then we pass as the second argument
the value, in this case, Other.

43
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.920
So we're gonna get back a database result.

44
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.990
It's either going to be a single
object since we called get.

45
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.110
It's either gonna be a single object
with whatever fields on it that we've

46
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.100
asked for, or it's gonna be null or
undefined because it failed.

47
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.790
So what we wanna do is check to see
whether or not we got back an ID.

48
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.040
If result &amp;&amp; result.id, then we're done.

49
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.805
We have an ID and we can simply return it.

50
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:31.661
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Otherwise,
we need to do a little bit more work,

51
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:35.471
which is we need to insert our
Other value into that table.

52
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.177
So with this one we're gonna
say result = await SQL3.run,

53
00:03:43.177 --> 00:03:48.178
because we're gonna do
an insert statement.

54
00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.140
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: INSERT INTO, the table
we're inserting into is called Other.

55
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.890
The columns that we are using in
the other table are just the data column.

56
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.105
And then the VALUES clause
is going to have just our

57
00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:16.473
single value with our placeholder.

58
00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:25.920
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And that will
insert Other into the other table.

59
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.980
Now we need to know whether
this succeeded, and if so,

60
00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.100
what was the primary key that it inserted,

61
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.630
because we've got an auto increment in
primary key what primary key was used.

62
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.025
And the way we do that is,
if result &amp;&amp; result.lastID,

63
00:04:44.025 --> 00:04:48.866
then we're gonna return result.lastID.

64
00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:54.900
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, so we need to check
to see whether or not that was successful.

65
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.985
So we're gonna say, if otherID.

66
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:06.330
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And then with this
otherID, we're gonna do some other work.

67
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.407
And that's when we're
gonna uncomment this,

68
00:05:10.034 --> 00:05:11.438
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Error because

69
00:05:11.438 --> 00:05:15.890
we want to return if
we've been successful.

70
00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:24.312
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So now that we have an
otherID that we've just been inserted or

71
00:05:24.312 --> 00:05:29.168
that we looked up, now the next task is we
need to insert into the something table.

72
00:05:30.722 --> 00:05:37.871
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So we need to make
another function called insertSomething.

73
00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:43.658
We're gonna be,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Getting

74
00:05:43.658 --> 00:05:47.590
back a result after awaiting that call.

75
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.243
We need to pass in the otherID, and

76
00:05:49.243 --> 00:05:52.606
we need to pass in the something
value that we've already generated.

77
00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:02.190
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And if that result
is successful, then we will return.

78
00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.849
Otherwise, something went wrong.
