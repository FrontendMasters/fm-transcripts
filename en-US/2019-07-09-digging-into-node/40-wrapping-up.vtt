&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Well,
that's what I've got for

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.990
you today in our course on Node.js,
Digging Into Node.

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.958
I hope that you have now got a much better
feeling for the kind of ins and outs of

4
00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:14.175
how to work your way around Node, how to
integrate with the system, how to do some

5
00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:18.870
fun little things like child processes or
store in the database, things like that.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.630
These are all the fundamental building
blocks upon which all of the libraries and

7
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.860
frameworks that you'll work in
Node will have been built on.

8
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.130
And probably the most important of all
of those is really getting a solid

9
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.650
understanding of streams.

10
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.930
So make sure you check
out that stream handbook.

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.167
Make sure you check out the course by
Substack here on Frontend Masters and

12
00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:41.120
really just dig into Node.

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.200
It's a fun and
exciting ecosystem to play with.

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.140
And I don't see it going
away anytime soon.

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.130
So thanks for being here.

16
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.320
I hope you've enjoyed this course.
