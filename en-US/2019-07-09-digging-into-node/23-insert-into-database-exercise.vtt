00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.220
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I'm gonna have
you try your hand at implementing

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.630
the insertSomething function.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.530
We'll take just a couple of
minutes to let you try your hand

4
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.870
at implementing insertSomething.

5
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.940
And it's gonna look an awful lot like the
insertOrLookupOther, except a little bit

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.530
more straightforward, cuz it only used to
do the last part instead of both parts.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.910
But go ahead and write and
async function called insertSomething,

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.130
it's got to take the other ID in the
something, it's got to insert them into

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.190
the something table, and then return
a true if it was successful, otherwise,

10
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.180
return something false, if it wasn't.

11
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.240
We'll take a couple of minutes and
then we'll come back and

12
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.990
talk about the insertSomething function.
