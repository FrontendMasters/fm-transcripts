00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.545
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's
update our program and

2
00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:08.577
then we'll update our help.

3
00:00:08.577 --> 00:00:11.543
We're gonna do something
a little bit different now.

4
00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:16.016
By default, we've been printing to
the standard out, but let's just for

5
00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:19.140
our purposes have a default
of writing to a file, and

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.500
then we'll have a configuration where you
can dump to the standard out if you want.

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.410
But we'll assume that maybe you
wanna write to another file.

8
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.022
So i'm gonna create
a variable called OUTFILE,

9
00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:36.521
and we want,
actually let me do it afterwards,

10
00:00:36.521 --> 00:00:41.005
we want for OUTFILE to,
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Be

11
00:00:41.005 --> 00:00:44.572
the path.join with BASE_PATH,
wherever that is.

12
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.750
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Concatenated
with a file name of out.txt.

13
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.411
So we're basically just saying
wherever it found the file,

14
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:03.660
whatever kind of processing it is gonna
write it back out to another file.

15
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.391
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now,
if we set up a boolean flag for out,

16
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:15.414
this is going to allow us to tell it no,
no, no,

17
00:01:15.414 --> 00:01:20.970
don't write it to that file,
just jumped it to the standard out.

18
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.695
So we're gonna be able to control
the target stream that we wanna go after.

19
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.326
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So down here in our
process file when we are selecting

20
00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:40.890
the process.standard out what we wanna
do is have some selection logic.

21
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.664
If orgs.out,
meaning we've told the program

22
00:01:45.664 --> 00:01:49.481
we want you to go to process.stdout,

23
00:01:49.481 --> 00:01:54.990
then we want to say
targetStream= process.stdout.

24
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.265
But if it's not specified,
then we wanna make a file system

25
00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:05.870
stream to dump the contents from
the stream into another file.

26
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.616
And remember, because it's stream
processing, because of the piping,

27
00:02:09.616 --> 00:02:13.837
it's gonna dump only 65K each time, so it
doesn't have to read the whole thing and

28
00:02:13.837 --> 00:02:15.280
then write the whole thing.

29
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.195
So how do we make an output stream?

30
00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.751
It's pretty straightforward,

31
00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:25.227
we're going to say targetStream
is equal to fs.createWriteStream,

32
00:02:25.227 --> 00:02:29.895
and we're going to give it that
half that we set up at the top.

33
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.919
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So now we're deciding
which stream we want to pipe our contents

34
00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:42.485
to based upon our parameters that
we pass in the command line.

35
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.790
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And by default,
we wanna go to out.text

36
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.550
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, so

37
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.067
let's update our help just to
make sure we don't forget that.

38
00:03:08.105 --> 00:03:11.344
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: --out
says print to the stdout,

39
00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:17.050
we won't do that by default,
but you can configure that on.

40
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.177
So, if we go back to our code,

41
00:03:20.177 --> 00:03:24.681
if we run this without adding the --out,

42
00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:28.950
now we shouldn't see any output at all.

43
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.755
But if we look in the files directory,
oops,

44
00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:37.300
I'm sorry, in this directory.

45
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.470
You'll notice now we have an out.txt,
which is our 1 megabyte copied file.

46
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.000
And if we look at the contents of out.txt,

47
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.520
you'll notice that it was
the transformed copy of it.
