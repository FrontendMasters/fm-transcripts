00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.830
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now we also want to
send out, that we wanna route for

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.900
handling any of the static file requests.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:14.990
And so we're gonna call app.use, that's
the more general form of the middleware.

4
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.310
When we say app.get,
it's specifically for get requests.

5
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.640
App.use is for all incoming requests.

6
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.196
And we're gonna call express.static.

7
00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:38.787
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And we're gonna
configure express.static with our

8
00:00:38.787 --> 00:00:41.770
WEB_PATH as the route.

9
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.869
I mean, as the doc root.

10
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.572
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And then there's some
additional configurations that we can

11
00:00:50.572 --> 00:00:53.182
optionally put in there,
like we can put in.

12
00:00:55.762 --> 00:00:58.370
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: These that I've
got here in the solution file.

13
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:06.159
Not that these are strictly necessary,

14
00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.336
but we can put those in if we'd like.

15
00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:16.667
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: This function here is
called whenever we have an outbound

16
00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.290
request and we need to add custom headers.

17
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.640
So this is how you add
custom headers with Express.

18
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.850
You have to specify this setHeaders
function and then do your own setHeaders.

19
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.930
So here I wanted to make sure
to pass in the server response.

20
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.940
That's something that static
alias was handling for us before.

21
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.038
We want it to do that with this.

22
00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:41.500
So basically express.static
is a static file server

23
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.370
that's almost exactly
identical to node static.

24
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.250
It's the one that express shapes,
but it's almost identical.

25
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.300
It's gonna handle almost all
the stuff that we would think of.
