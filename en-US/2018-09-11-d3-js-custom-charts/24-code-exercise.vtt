00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So I have an exercise for
us that I want to to do together.

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.070
And I want to implement the designs I had

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.600
shown you, the chicken scratch
thing I had shown you prior.

4
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.510
And in particular,
I want us to just get to this point.

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.540
And so, this is kind o,
each curve representing a movie.

6
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.433
The x-axis being the release date and

7
00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:30.602
the y-axis being the box
office relative to the mean.
