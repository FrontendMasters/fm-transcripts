&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Interactions, and in this
section I want to talk about the fact that

2
00:00:04.973 --> 00:00:10.119
with D3, and just D3, I think it's
really easy to put in hover, and

3
00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:15.180
click, and other really simple
interactions, so it's pretty easy

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.502
to do that with D3, but if you want
any more complicated interactions,

5
00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:25.649
I would actually encourage you to
use something like React, or view,

6
00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:30.399
or other similar things that help
you manage your application.

7
00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.636
The more complicated it is, React or
something else, will make that

8
00:00:35.636 --> 00:00:40.601
a lot easier, and oftentimes I
will use React with D3 to help me,

9
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:45.750
if I have user interactions where
I have to update the visualization

10
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.939
after each user manipulation
of the underlying data.

11
00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:54.436
So if they can edit any parts of the data,
and that has to be reflected in

12
00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:58.718
the visualization right away,
I would use something like React.

13
00:00:58.718 --> 00:01:01.918
I would use something like React
if I wanted to be linking multiple

14
00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:02.801
visualization.

15
00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:08.142
So if interactions with one
visualization will change

16
00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:13.610
the look of a different
visualization I will use React.

17
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.535
So that could be something
like crossfilter where

18
00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:22.300
you can drag a brush around to
filter different bar charts and

19
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.636
that affects the looks of every
other chart or something like that.

20
00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:32.313
You can definitely do it with
D3 using D3 dispatch, and

21
00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:37.284
it is this kind of pub-sub model,
but I find that my code gets

22
00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:42.372
really messy and often pretty buggy and
kind of hard to debug.

23
00:01:42.372 --> 00:01:47.113
When I do it with just D3 &amp; React,
it makes that really easy for

24
00:01:47.113 --> 00:01:51.319
me, and finally things like
exploratory tools, and so

25
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.599
that comes back to what we were talking
at the very beginning of today,

26
00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.184
when we were talking about
expository versus exploratory.

27
00:02:01.184 --> 00:02:05.422
A lot of exploratory tools where you
can do some filtering or aggregating.

28
00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:10.441
Those sorts of things is really
great with React when you use it

29
00:02:10.441 --> 00:02:16.618
in conjunction with D3, and as I
mentioned at the very beginning of today,

30
00:02:16.618 --> 00:02:21.349
there's that other course
that's data where I go

31
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.910
into kind of these interactions
a little bit at the end.

32
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.101
So, if you're interested,
take a look at that.
