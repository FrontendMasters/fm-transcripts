1
00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.910
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So that's a little
bit that I wanted to mention.

2
00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.090
And the one last thing that I want to do,
this idea of a heat map.

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.890
And so,
what we have here is being able to do

4
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.370
a heat map by the genre on the y-axis and

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.360
the months on the x-axis,
and then colored by

6
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.940
how many movies are in there.

7
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.540
So the intensity of the colors would
be how many movies fall into that cell.

8
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.387
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My idea with
this was actually popularity.

9
00:00:42.387 --> 00:00:45.716
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay, good.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Based on the meta votes,

10
00:00:45.716 --> 00:00:48.900
the number of votes.

11
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.390
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's keep
it a little bit simpler.

12
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.390
I think when we're doing exploration,
let's not reload it too much.

13
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.470
I think the simpler the better.

14
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.830
And then when we're designing,
we can pick and

15
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.190
choose what attributes are good and
then design around that.

16
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.481
But for this one, let's keep it simple.

17
00:01:10.481 --> 00:01:15.264
So,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes,

18
00:01:18.555 --> 00:01:19.738
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: For heat maps,

19
00:01:19.738 --> 00:01:24.927
I haven't quite had a chance to
use them before, so hopefully it's

20
00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:30.494
as straightforward as before But
let's look at this example together.

21
00:01:30.494 --> 00:01:34.762
So I found an example on Vega-Lite.

22
00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:38.940
And what it's telling me is
that it needs the data source.

23
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.490
This one has a title and
some configurations about,

24
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.990
I guess some of the axis or

25
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.610
the scales, but I think hopefully
we don't need to bother with that.

26
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.940
The important thing, it seems, is that for

27
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.700
a heat map, the mark is the rectangle,
which makes sense.

28
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.797
And then the x-axis,
they're using a date too.

29
00:02:05.797 --> 00:02:08.289
They're using dates, but

30
00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.922
they're making the dates
categorical instead of temporal so

31
00:02:13.922 --> 00:02:18.481
that, I think, so
that they can bend by the date.

32
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:23.266
So for us,
let me start writing this down, actually.

33
00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:29.443
This one is a heat map where
the x-axis is the month.

34
00:02:29.443 --> 00:02:35.585
And then the y-axis for us is the genres.

35
00:02:37.412 --> 00:02:40.722
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: [COUGH] And
let's do it this way.

36
00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:47.579
So in terms of the x-axis with the months,
what we want to do is have a,

37
00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.580
we still want to use the field,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: That's the release date.

38
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.990
But in this case we can say time unit, and

39
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.380
that's another one of those things
in Vega-Lite that you can specify.

40
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.890
But we'll use time unit as month.

41
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.394
And then that goes together
with type ordinal.

42
00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:20.950
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So
that it knows to bucket by months.

43
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.140
Each of the cells are bucketed by months.

44
00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:28.715
And if we want it to be fancy, and

45
00:03:28.715 --> 00:03:32.105
this is a final visualization,
I think that's why they have the axes and

46
00:03:32.105 --> 00:03:35.255
they're labeling it a specific way and
formatting a specific way.

47
00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:39.393
But we're just trying to do exploration,
so we can probably ignore that part.

48
00:03:39.393 --> 00:03:45.875
And the y-axis for them is date,
but for us should be genres.

49
00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:50.225
So I think the type is probably nominal,

50
00:03:50.225 --> 00:03:55.410
cuz it's not ordinal because genres
don't have a specified order.

51
00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.850
Where as in this one in the x-axis,
the months are ordinal.

52
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.226
And then the field

53
00:04:06.226 --> 00:04:11.606
should be genre.

54
00:04:11.606 --> 00:04:16.880
And then the color of
each of the cells is,

55
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.252
they're doing it by, actually,

56
00:04:21.252 --> 00:04:25.186
Mark, let's do it both ways.

57
00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:32.610
One, that's just the count, and
another that is the meta score.

58
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.590
Let's see if we can try both of them.

59
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.901
So let's try for the first one,

60
00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:46.198
having it being type quantitative and

61
00:04:46.198 --> 00:04:50.525
having it be the field, so

62
00:04:50.525 --> 00:04:56.250
having it be aggregated by count.

63
00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.420
And then the field being everything,
so this asterisk.

64
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.450
So basically you're just
aggregating each record of a movie.

65
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.310
And so we'll try that first, and
then I think after that I think

66
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.448
we should be able to change
the color to use the field.

67
00:05:16.448 --> 00:05:17.299
Was the look up?

68
00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:23.484
So maybe we can use the,
instead of aggregating by max or

69
00:05:23.484 --> 00:05:29.811
by count maybe we can aggregate
by the median meta score.

70
00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:34.293
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was thinking
the actual IMDB votes is a proxy for

71
00:05:34.293 --> 00:05:36.813
how popular something is.

72
00:05:36.813 --> 00:05:38.352
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay, so IMDB votes?

73
00:05:38.352 --> 00:05:42.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
IMDB votes would be how many votes,

74
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:50.134
seems like it would give you
an indicator of how popular a video is.

75
00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:55.485
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: That's a great point,
so lets aggregate median,

76
00:05:55.485 --> 00:06:01.583
let's still use median votes,
aggregate by the median,

77
00:06:01.583 --> 00:06:04.950
but the field is the IMDB votes.

78
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And we can try both or

79
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.700
different things as far as ratings, but
I was looking at popularity over a month.

80
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.115
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I think you're right in
that vote are going to be much more-

81
00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:16.942
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Interesting.

82
00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:20.120
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, or
much more reflective of popularity.

83
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.890
That's probably a really safe guess.

84
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.030
So let's do all of these together.

85
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.426
So let's get the data ready, and

86
00:06:28.426 --> 00:06:33.462
in this case we're saying,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This

87
00:06:33.462 --> 00:06:38.175
is by month, genre, popularity.

88
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:43.898
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And
let's go through the data again.

89
00:06:47.632 --> 00:06:55.612
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And so for
each of them I want to return a date,

90
00:06:55.612 --> 00:07:01.497
that is the release, released.

91
00:07:01.497 --> 00:07:05.453
And then the y-axis is genre, so

92
00:07:05.453 --> 00:07:12.671
again is d.genre.split to turn
that string into an array.

93
00:07:12.671 --> 00:07:18.540
And then I want to just take
the first one, and then for

94
00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:25.660
when we do the median votes,
let's just get that in there.

95
00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:32.240
And that one would be just turning

96
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.590
the IMDB votes into an integer.

97
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.143
Does anyone see what I am doing wrong?

98
00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:46.390
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let me see.

99
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.609
Okay, so that is what I am doing wrong.

100
00:07:48.609 --> 00:07:52.753
So you can see that the votes
actually have a comma in between,

101
00:07:52.753 --> 00:07:56.111
that's why I can't just
turn it into an integer.

102
00:07:56.111 --> 00:08:00.061
Okay, so let me replace that comma.

103
00:08:02.603 --> 00:08:06.105
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: How do I do that globally,
if I'm not using a regex?

104
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:09.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Your first argument, and

105
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.850
I think you can put regex as
your first argument to replace.

106
00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.330
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Should I just do that?

107
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:19.667
Okay, let me just do that then,
let's do a regex so that I can, ooh.

108
00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:21.801
I'm missing a parens, okay.

109
00:08:25.184 --> 00:08:28.880
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So just a simple regex
to find the commas globally and

110
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.900
to replace my empty string.

111
00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:36.647
And now we have the votes, awesome.

112
00:08:36.647 --> 00:08:45.090
Okay, so let us,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Do the the Vega-Lite.

113
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.830
Let me pin this and
we'll do the Vega-Lite.

114
00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:53.341
Okay, so we said for Vega-Lite, again,

115
00:08:53.341 --> 00:08:59.471
pass in the data, values,
a month, genre, popularity.

116
00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:04.566
And then the encoding, sorry,
the mark is rectangles,

117
00:09:04.566 --> 00:09:08.610
and encoding we said we had x,
y, and color.

118
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.950
X we want it to be the field is

119
00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.990
date, the type is ordinal.

120
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.620
And we said the time unit,

121
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.710
we want the ordinal to be aggregated
into months, so let's give it month.

122
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.120
And then y is,

123
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.790
the field is genre, and
the type is nominal.

124
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.850
And then the color,
we want it to be, the first one is

125
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.340
basically how many movies are in there.

126
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:52.575
So let's do an,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's see,

127
00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:57.508
type is quantitative
because it's the number

128
00:09:57.508 --> 00:10:01.563
of records, and aggregate is count.

129
00:10:01.563 --> 00:10:07.072
And let's aggregate it by all of
the fields so we don't have to.

130
00:10:20.374 --> 00:10:26.134
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So actually,
look at that action.

131
00:10:26.134 --> 00:10:27.879
This is really interesting.

132
00:10:27.879 --> 00:10:32.439
So there's action movies pretty much in

133
00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:37.408
all the months except for
October it seems.

134
00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:45.008
And then action movies, apparently
they are 31 action movies in May.

135
00:10:45.008 --> 00:10:50.423
That's ever in the last
two decades blockbusters,

136
00:10:50.423 --> 00:10:56.953
apparently action movies I guess
there's a lot of them in May.

137
00:10:56.953 --> 00:11:02.229
And there are some others like comedy,
this is great.

138
00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:10.085
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So that really does make
me really curious about the popularity.

139
00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:14.110
So let me just copy and
paste this one over really quickly.

140
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:17.380
I'm going to move this down a little bit.

141
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.970
I'll pin this code and
then this should be as easy, hopefully,

142
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:28.770
as changing the color aggregation to
the median and the field to votes.

143
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.960
And hopefully that works.

144
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.998
I don't really know if I
agree with this color scheme.

145
00:11:36.998 --> 00:11:41.230
[LAUGH] Yeah, look at that.

146
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That is a bit weird.

147
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.380
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: It is a bit weird.

148
00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:45.020
So we have to train
ourselves a little bit.

149
00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.959
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Blue and
black are not popular.

150
00:11:47.959 --> 00:11:51.695
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Less, yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Radiating through turquoise.

151
00:11:51.695 --> 00:11:57.320
[LAUGH] Yellow is really popular
in October, December, and January.

152
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.760
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: October,
December, and January.

153
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:10.220
So the thing that I want to be careful of
when we look at this is these are medians.

154
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.699
So but I think I-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we try max?

155
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:16.570
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes, we can-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just to see the difference.

156
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.410
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: We can see max.

157
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:24.200
And so the max is 2 million,
and it's July and action.

158
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:29.727
But I do want to be careful of the fact
that, so this is great because

159
00:12:29.727 --> 00:12:35.583
this is a number of movies and
then this is the maximum number of votes.

160
00:12:35.583 --> 00:12:39.379
So that means maybe some of them here are,

161
00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:44.372
in July there are the most
popular movie was released.

162
00:12:44.372 --> 00:12:50.230
But then there aren't as many action
movies that were made in July.

163
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.350
I think it's the combination of the two
would probably be quite meaningful.

164
00:12:55.420 --> 00:13:00.667
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Technical question, as we're
changing these aggregation functions,

165
00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:05.074
are these the ones that are defined by D3,
do you know which?

166
00:13:05.074 --> 00:13:10.938
Cuz I know D3 has their account and
has their statistics library.

167
00:13:10.938 --> 00:13:12.377
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: That's
a really great question.

168
00:13:12.377 --> 00:13:14.841
Let's look at the documentation.

169
00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:19.914
So in the aggregate,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I

170
00:13:19.914 --> 00:13:26.730
also noticed that the genre
is listed by alphabetically.

171
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.460
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes.

172
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.583
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
it's gonna lean towards a is action.

173
00:13:32.583 --> 00:13:33.559
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes, yes.

174
00:13:33.559 --> 00:13:36.439
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Versus h, horror,
obviously there's more movies,

175
00:13:36.439 --> 00:13:41.710
but because we're only grabbing the first
category it's gonna lean towards action.

176
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:46.700
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes, and that's going
to be a design decision later.

177
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.270
I mean,
it's part of the data exploration too.

178
00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:53.000
I think if we have more time we should
definitely be looking at all of them.

179
00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.014
And once we look at all of them,
it's a design decision

180
00:13:58.014 --> 00:14:02.374
of if we were to build
something around genres,

181
00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:06.516
do we only build it with
just the first genre,

182
00:14:06.516 --> 00:14:13.073
which like you said is biased
towards alphabetical, unfortunately.

183
00:14:13.073 --> 00:14:15.967
Or do we take all of them and
somehow try and

184
00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:20.042
reconcile the fact that there's
three genres per movie.

185
00:14:20.042 --> 00:14:22.450
So that's also a design decision.

186
00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:27.388
Yeah, so I think,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This is

187
00:14:27.388 --> 00:14:28.740
quite interesting I think.

188
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:36.120
So again, it seems like action
is just watched a lot and

189
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.170
then action is also-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we just each

190
00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:48.260
over the genres and then create more data?

191
00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:49.983
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: To get all the genres

192
00:14:49.983 --> 00:14:50.600
in there.

193
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.460
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So you wanna do, basically
let's do this really quickly together.

194
00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The genre array.

195
00:14:56.850 --> 00:14:59.062
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So I would do it as-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Let's create lots of

196
00:14:59.062 --> 00:15:03.610
different records for- Yeah, so for

197
00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:08.350
the sake of data exploration,
let's do that.

198
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:15.090
And so what we want to do is within
that we want to for each of the genres.

199
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:21.950
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So basically for this part,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: We

200
00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.790
want to iterate over that.

201
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:27.147
Whoops, map.

202
00:15:27.147 --> 00:15:31.184
Return an array.

203
00:15:34.102 --> 00:15:39.528
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: For each movie return
an array of its genres with date and

204
00:15:39.528 --> 00:15:43.806
genre and
votes information in all of them.

205
00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:47.041
And then it's going to return
an array of arrays, so flatten that.

206
00:15:47.041 --> 00:15:54.236
And then hopefully we'll be able to see,
let's see, so now there's 570 records.

207
00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:59.682
[LAUGH] And
then that should give us an updated

208
00:15:59.682 --> 00:16:06.169
version that's a lot longer,
a little bit longer.

209
00:16:06.169 --> 00:16:10.980
And it's true that action and
adventure is still most popular,

210
00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.893
but we can see a little bit more of,
that's really interesting.

211
00:16:15.893 --> 00:16:24.590
These crime and dramas that were released
in July have almost 2 million votes also.

212
00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:32.820
Even though if you look at crime and
drama in July there weren't necessarily

213
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.920
that many movies that were released, but
they turned out to be extremely popular.

214
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.760
What I usually do after
all of this is I kind of

215
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:51.370
write down what I learned, and
then what I want to create my design,

216
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:58.140
what kind of themes I want
to center my design around.
