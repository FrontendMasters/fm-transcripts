00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.739
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Finally,

2
00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:05.592
I want to cover a little bit about
exploratory visualizations today.

3
00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:09.824
Today, we've been talking
all about storytelling,

4
00:00:09.824 --> 00:00:15.625
suppository visualizations and
what it takes the process to build those.

5
00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:20.391
And so Susie and Elijah over at
Netflix helped me out with this

6
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:25.252
part just because I don't have
as much experience with that,

7
00:00:25.252 --> 00:00:28.441
with exploratory data visualization.

8
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:32.387
But this is what they do day in and
day out at Netflix,

9
00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:35.723
and they gave me some
really great insight.

10
00:00:35.723 --> 00:00:40.642
So the very first thing the process that
they go through whenever they're trying to

11
00:00:40.642 --> 00:00:45.632
build a new exploratory data visualization
is they'll have an initial meeting with

12
00:00:45.632 --> 00:00:50.624
their stakeholders to figure out the most
important questions that they're trying

13
00:00:50.624 --> 00:00:55.501
to ask and solve for, and then they'll
actually meet with their data engineers.

14
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.826
So that already is pretty
different from our process today.

15
00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:02.426
Because unlike the sunny
data sets that we use today,

16
00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:04.756
they have a dynamic live data set.

17
00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:09.918
And so they need to work with
data engineers to kind of figure

18
00:01:09.918 --> 00:01:16.632
out how can they get the data such that
like the data that's most important for

19
00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:22.018
answering the questions come
back faster from the data base.

20
00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:24.495
So they'll have a meeting
with the data engineers.

21
00:01:24.495 --> 00:01:29.755
And after that,
they'll mark up their ideas in sketch or

22
00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:34.907
they'll sandbox with semiotics
which is a library that

23
00:01:34.907 --> 00:01:42.823
Elijah has written to make prototyping
data visualizations really, really quick.

24
00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:47.817
And that kind of comes from their
experiences interfacing with stakeholders

25
00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:52.654
and having to, in that meeting with
the stakeholders kind of prototype and

26
00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:55.959
really quickly change
between visualizations and

27
00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.800
see if that helps answer
the stakeholders's questions and

28
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.840
that also helps them see
the shape of the data.

29
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.183
And finally, they'll go and prototype and

30
00:02:06.183 --> 00:02:10.621
iterate with the stakeholders
until they get something.

31
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:15.604
I think that the stakeholders
then can then take in,

32
00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:21.504
use in their explorations and
try to answer their questions.

33
00:02:21.504 --> 00:02:24.970
And so
I have some advice from the two of them.

34
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.160
So I asked them what are some things
that you might right into quite

35
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.392
often across all of the different
projects you've done.

36
00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:40.845
And so one other things they said was,
it's a different data source

37
00:02:40.845 --> 00:02:46.887
than I think when it's expository and
it's often very often SQL queries.

38
00:02:46.887 --> 00:02:50.935
And so
when you're designing your visualization,

39
00:02:50.935 --> 00:02:56.917
you have to take into account and plan for
the queries that might take longer.

40
00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:00.975
And so it's especially important if you
have interactions that are filtering or

41
00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:02.534
aggregating, or something.

42
00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:07.763
If those filterings require additional
SQL queries or something and

43
00:03:07.763 --> 00:03:12.180
they might take a few seconds
to ten seconds or whatever for

44
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.335
the results to come back, try and
plan around that or plan for that.

45
00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:22.970
Either that or try and
make a lot of interactions, or try and

46
00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.301
build a lot of your design around
the data that comes back quicker.

47
00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:32.864
And when they're talking with
their stakeholders often

48
00:03:32.864 --> 00:03:36.128
time the questions that they
might ask them is what is

49
00:03:36.128 --> 00:03:39.554
the business question that
you're trying to answer?

50
00:03:39.554 --> 00:03:45.760
And also oftentimes, they'll talk about
metrics that they're comparing and

51
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.332
how do those metrics fall into
a decision that they're trying to make?

52
00:03:51.332 --> 00:03:57.208
And they also talked about the level of
aggregation that's most effective for

53
00:03:57.208 --> 00:04:02.016
that decision-making and
they gave the advice of get it to about

54
00:04:02.016 --> 00:04:06.395
seven things that are granular,
and meaningful enough.

55
00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.270
If not, the top ten of a default.

56
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.896
I think when they say that,

57
00:04:10.896 --> 00:04:15.005
it means that a lot of stakeholders
will want to just get everything.

58
00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:20.481
They just wanted to see every single
thing and it's our job while we're

59
00:04:20.481 --> 00:04:25.500
talking to the stakeholders to kind
of get to the bottom of exactly

60
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.158
which parts of the data are the most
important to answer those questions,

61
00:04:31.158 --> 00:04:34.831
and I thought this one
was really interesting.

62
00:04:34.831 --> 00:04:36.918
A lot of these advice aren't code at all.

63
00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:39.716
A lot of these advice are soft skills,
communication skills.

64
00:04:39.716 --> 00:04:44.080
And they said it's really, really
important, especially in the organization

65
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.841
that doesn't really have
data virtualization and

66
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:50.051
doesn't really actually trust
data visualization yet and

67
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:54.237
they think of it as this flashy thing
like why would we need this flashy thing?

68
00:04:54.237 --> 00:04:58.684
Gain trust and
credibility within the organization.

69
00:04:58.684 --> 00:05:03.763
Because oftentimes, if we're coming
into an organization trying to bring and

70
00:05:03.763 --> 00:05:06.796
communicate the value
of data visualization,

71
00:05:06.796 --> 00:05:12.129
what we're competing with oftentimes is
tables of data like tables of Excel data.

72
00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.785
And that's really detailed and
that's really hard to read, but

73
00:05:14.785 --> 00:05:16.137
that's what they're used to and

74
00:05:16.137 --> 00:05:18.903
they like the fact that they have
access to absolutely everything.

75
00:05:18.903 --> 00:05:21.243
And we want to kinda
convince them like no,

76
00:05:21.243 --> 00:05:24.560
actually you don't want access
to absolutely everything.

77
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.252
Let me show you this way or a this way to
kind of just narrow in on the data that

78
00:05:29.252 --> 00:05:31.548
will help you answer the question.

79
00:05:31.548 --> 00:05:33.483
And finally, I like this one a lot.

80
00:05:33.483 --> 00:05:37.766
People will get to a state that you never
designed for and they will error out.

81
00:05:37.766 --> 00:05:42.365
So try and think through as many of
the edge cases that you can, but they'll

82
00:05:42.365 --> 00:05:46.906
probably always just get to a point
that they were like how did you, what?

83
00:05:46.906 --> 00:05:48.183
What were you thinking.

84
00:05:48.183 --> 00:05:53.582
I before I went freelance,
I ran into this a lot too.

85
00:05:53.582 --> 00:05:57.236
But that also goes back to into
building trusting credibility within

86
00:05:57.236 --> 00:06:00.900
the organization, try and account for
as many edge cases as you can.
