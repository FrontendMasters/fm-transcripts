00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So this workshop is called
Building Custom Data Visualizations.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:09.310
My name is Shirley, and I'm an independent
creator of data visualizations.

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.285
And I'm a co-organizer of
barrier d3 user group and

4
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:21.097
the annual d3.unconference,
which is usually in the fall,

5
00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:25.497
and please check it out
if you're interested.

6
00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:30.742
And I'm also an instructor
on Frontend Masters.

7
00:00:30.742 --> 00:00:36.182
So I have a few different
workshops on Frontend Masters,

8
00:00:36.182 --> 00:00:40.386
and I want to go through
this with you today.

9
00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:45.550
So yesterday, I did the workshop called
Data Visualization for React Developers.

10
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.225
And so that one, the goal for is for

11
00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:53.672
people that are coming from a very
strong Frontend React background,

12
00:00:53.672 --> 00:00:57.574
but don't yet
have any database D3 background.

13
00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:02.138
And I wanted a slow,
sort of gentle introduction into D3,

14
00:01:02.138 --> 00:01:06.430
into Data Visualization,
without getting caught up in

15
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.085
the details of what a lot of
people are intimidated by in D3,

16
00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:17.110
which is kind of the data binding,
enter, update, exit patterns.

17
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.856
And then once they get
through that they can check

18
00:01:21.856 --> 00:01:25.687
out the introduction to D3 workshop.

19
00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:31.574
And in that one I cover what we
consider the core parts of D3,

20
00:01:31.574 --> 00:01:38.155
which is that data binding,
interrupt data exit, and all of that,

21
00:01:38.155 --> 00:01:44.286
and then hopefully teach people
how to look into D3 [LAUGH] API.

22
00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:47.560
How to read through the API,
how to read code samples.

23
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.757
And I'm so excited about today,
because originally I

24
00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:56.513
was considering doing something
that was like advanced D3.

25
00:01:56.513 --> 00:02:01.508
But then as I thought a lot more about
what an advanced D3 workshop would be,

26
00:02:01.508 --> 00:02:06.860
it felt like it would be kind of an
enumerating and going through the D3 API.

27
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.106
And maybe we'll build forest
layouts in these different ways,

28
00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:14.574
we'll build trees in different ways or
something.

29
00:02:14.574 --> 00:02:18.483
And I felt like that just wasn't as
much of a productive use of our time,

30
00:02:18.483 --> 00:02:21.752
cuz I feel like that sort of
thing just comes with practice.

31
00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:25.591
The intuition of how to use
different parts of the library and

32
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:30.760
how to read the library documentation,
etc, just comes with practice.

33
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.630
And so instead I really thought about,

34
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.210
what do I want people to be able
to get out of this workshop?

35
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.810
If not advanced D3,
what is it that I want to teach people?

36
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.276
And then I realized one of the hardest
things I had in these few years of

37
00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:55.359
building data visualization is,
I come from a computer science background.

38
00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.997
I come back from a Frontend
engineering background, and

39
00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:01.586
I got into data visualization with D3.

40
00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:06.294
And so I understand the code part of
building data visualizations, but

41
00:03:06.294 --> 00:03:09.587
what I didn't realize until
maybe a few years in,

42
00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:14.990
is how important all of the other parts
of building data visualizations are.

43
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:22.330
So where to get data sets, how to explore
that data set, and explore that for

44
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.370
some sort of a message, or insight, or
something you're trying to communicate.

45
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.408
How to design around that, and then
how to turn that design into the code,

46
00:03:31.408 --> 00:03:36.200
which is the part that, as Frontend
developers on Frontend Masters,

47
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.494
we're probably really good at.

48
00:03:38.494 --> 00:03:43.347
I feel like the code part is
probably quite trivial as soon as

49
00:03:43.347 --> 00:03:47.680
you get a good design to
translate into the code.

50
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.050
So today I want to concentrate a lot on,
or

51
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.780
give equal parts to the data,
the design, and the code.

52
00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.340
And so that is the goal for today.

53
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.031
And if you've been here
in the other workshops or

54
00:04:03.031 --> 00:04:07.622
if you've gone through my other
workshops you might realize

55
00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:12.227
there is some overlap between
all three of these workshops.

56
00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:16.461
So I want these workshops to be
able to stand on their own, but

57
00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:21.127
there is going to be some overlap,
so please be patient with that.

58
00:04:21.127 --> 00:04:25.996
And then if you're coming,
not from React but from elsewhere,

59
00:04:25.996 --> 00:04:31.000
my recommendation is to go from
Intro to D3 to this workshop.

60
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.323
And then, actually it might
be good to look at kind of

61
00:04:34.323 --> 00:04:37.504
the tail-end of
the React Developers workshop.

62
00:04:37.504 --> 00:04:42.530
Because in that part, I covered very
briefly how to do interactions between

63
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.244
different visualizations,
what we call linked visualizations, and

64
00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:51.818
it's kind of harder to do that with
just Vanilla JavaScript and D3.

65
00:04:51.818 --> 00:04:55.245
But with React or
with these sorts of frameworks,

66
00:04:55.245 --> 00:05:00.071
they make it really easy to be able
to do interactive visualizations.

67
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:07.053
So that's my recommendations for
the workshops I have on Frontend Masters.
