00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Don't get
on the computer just yet.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.275
Use the papers you have and

3
00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:09.670
let's brainstorm some of the charts
to answer the questions.

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.500
And I recommend you,
just picking maybe one of the questions,

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.880
write it on the top and
then just brainstorm, is this

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.080
one going to be helpful to look at with
let's say a bar chart or a scatter plot.

7
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.520
And if you want to look at other
things that Vega-Light can do,

8
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.550
I'm going to pull this up.

9
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.940
So this is the example gallery for
Vega-Light.

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.190
You can just search for
a Vega-Light example gallery.

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.840
And these are other visualizations that
you can potentially do with Vega-Light.

12
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.040
So if the four things I showed you
earlier maybe doesn't help you

13
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.990
answer the question, you can look at these
that might help answer the questions.

14
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.210
But before you jump into doing Vega-Light
in observable notebook we had earlier,

15
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.930
I just want us to jot down some
ideas on pen and paper, yeah.

16
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.443
So let's do this for the next,

17
00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:15.901
I want to give us a little bit more time,
15 minutes.

18
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:19.185
And,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: After 15

19
00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:20.531
minutes we'll come back.

20
00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:25.279
We'll talk about the different
data chart or data types, and

21
00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:29.674
then we'll play around with
them in Vega-Lite, yeah.
