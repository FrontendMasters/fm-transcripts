00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.250
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And I think for today,

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.960
we probably only have the time to
explore one or two of these questions.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.702
But keeping these in mind,
I want to then start talking about

4
00:00:11.702 --> 00:00:18.022
how do we explore that data quickly
to come to some sort of answers?

5
00:00:18.022 --> 00:00:22.774
Or to either validate or debunk some
of these questions and hypotheses.

6
00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:27.097
And so what I want to talk
about is some basic chart

7
00:00:27.097 --> 00:00:31.115
types to help you with
the data exploration.

8
00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:37.805
And so I think I have just four in
here that I've asked around and

9
00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:44.001
seeing what charts help with
the basic data exploration.

10
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:48.516
So a bar chart is one of those really
common, really easy ones that are quick.

11
00:00:48.516 --> 00:00:51.295
So bar charts are really good for
categorical

12
00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:56.061
comparisons where the domain is
categorical and the range is quantitative.

13
00:00:56.061 --> 00:01:00.423
So in this particular example,
it's the movie genres, and

14
00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:05.020
then the number of movies
that fall into those genres.

15
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.901
Histograms are really great for

16
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:15.086
if you want to look up
a distribution of something.

17
00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:21.942
So if the domain is, for
where the domain is quantitative,

18
00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:28.130
and you want to bucket those
records into these bins.

19
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.356
So the example I like to give
is if you have movies and

20
00:01:31.356 --> 00:01:34.970
their meta-scores that we
were talking about earlier.

21
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.552
So if you want to put them into
every ten points or every 10% or

22
00:01:39.552 --> 00:01:44.133
something, and then the range
is the frequency, the number of

23
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:49.084
movies that fall into those bins.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Scatter

24
00:01:49.084 --> 00:01:51.340
plots are really great for correlations.

25
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.630
So all of the versus that we were talking
about like this meta-score versus this

26
00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.410
IMDB rating versus etc, that's really
great to test out with correlation.

27
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.357
So correlations is great for
when you have two attributes, and

28
00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:11.876
you want to see the relationship
between their quantitative

29
00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:16.947
values.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then for the temporal,

30
00:02:16.947 --> 00:02:21.915
it's line charts, line charts are really
great for looking for temporal trends.

31
00:02:21.915 --> 00:02:25.540
And so the domain for that is temporal and

32
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.698
the range is quantitative.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And so

33
00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:34.809
those are kind of the four that I hear
people talk about a lot in terms of just

34
00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:40.012
kind of understanding the data,
really quickly understanding the data.

35
00:02:40.012 --> 00:02:45.346
And for us today to explore the data,
I want to use something

36
00:02:45.346 --> 00:02:50.147
called Vega-Lite,
which is out of the, I think UW,

37
00:02:50.147 --> 00:02:55.424
I'm gonna get this wrong, the UW,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I

38
00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:57.859
call it the Jeff Heer lab.

39
00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.210
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

40
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.739
he runs the Interactive Data Lab.

41
00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.879
And Jeff Heer is actually
the professor who was overseeing

42
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.453
Mike Bostock when he was working
on an earlier version with D3.

43
00:03:15.453 --> 00:03:19.940
And then now Jeff Heer leads
this Interactive Data Lab, and

44
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.991
one of the things that they do is Vega and
Vega-Lite.

45
00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:27.610
And they call it a visualization
of grammar, I think,

46
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.520
a grammar of interactive graphics.

47
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.740
And so this is just a really quick way
of being able to compose visualizations.

48
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.384
And the way that you can do it is
you just give it a data source,

49
00:03:43.384 --> 00:03:47.501
you tell it what each
mark is supposed to be.

50
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:51.316
So it is a tick,
is it a bar, is it a point,

51
00:03:51.316 --> 00:03:55.250
is it a line, how is the data represented?

52
00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.162
And then you tell it what encodings
each of those marks have, so

53
00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:02.868
that could be x, y, color, etc.

54
00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:08.036
And for Vega-Lite, for
each encoding you need to give it a type.

55
00:04:08.036 --> 00:04:12.282
So that data type we were talking
about earlier, is it qualitative,

56
00:04:12.282 --> 00:04:16.472
is it temporal is it, instead of
categorical they call it nominal.

57
00:04:16.472 --> 00:04:22.466
And so that's why I talked a lot about
data types earlier and the field.

58
00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:24.952
And the field is basically the attribute,

59
00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:28.270
the name of that attribute
in your data object.

60
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.031
So those are the things that we
need to draw graphs with Vega-Lite.
