00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.452
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So
finally I want to give some resources.

2
00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:08.060
In terms of researching for
this particular workshop,

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.569
I counted these two books
were especially helpful, so

4
00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:15.804
The Functional Art by Alberto Cairo and

5
00:00:15.804 --> 00:00:20.500
Visual Analysis and
Design by Tamara Munzner.

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.087
So both of them were really
helpful in terms of kind of giving

7
00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:31.453
me a very organized approach
to thinking about the design

8
00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:36.623
of visualization,
as well as some resources online.

9
00:00:36.623 --> 00:00:41.430
I mentioned before, the Datawrapper Blog
has a lot of really great resources.

10
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.540
Flowing Data has a newsletter that,

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.190
just kind of, everyday,
just gives you noteworthy visualizations.

12
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.989
So that might be good to follow in
terms of just getting inspiration and

13
00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.652
seeing what other people
are doing with visualizations.

14
00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:07.252
Andy Kirk has a blog series
that's called The little of

15
00:01:07.252 --> 00:01:13.060
visualization design and
this one just kinda picks out details.

16
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.660
He doesn't talk about
the overall visualization.

17
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.250
He'll pick out one little detail in
the visualization that he thinks was done

18
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.506
really, really well and
talk about why that's well.

19
00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:26.910
And I really, really like that
little focus on the details.

20
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.661
And I think it's really important.

21
00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:32.770
I've talked about the pudding for
visual storytelling, there's also

22
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.130
the Information is Beautiful Awards, I'm
looking at past winners for inspiration.

23
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.090
I mean,
I also was going to plug data sketches,

24
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.463
which is the Project between Nadi and I.

25
00:01:45.463 --> 00:01:51.100
And it's a bunch of different
visualizations around different topics.

26
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.710
And we've gotten feedback that people
really, really like our process write up.

27
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.740
So we'll talk about how we got the data,
how we did the sketches and

28
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.950
how we did the code.

29
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.420
So I recommend that, too.

30
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.370
And finally I want to
thank all of these people.

31
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.630
I just realized I am a horrible person for

32
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.810
spelling Lisa's name wrong,
this might happen 2AM last night.

33
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.309
But I want to thank Lisa Rost for a lot
of the blog posts on data wrapper and

34
00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:33.188
Nadieh and Susie and Elijah for helping
give me feedback for this workshop.

35
00:02:33.188 --> 00:02:38.704
And all of my beautiful beta-testers
that made sure the content for

36
00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:41.135
this was as good as possible.

37
00:02:41.135 --> 00:02:46.723
And I want to thank you Frontend Masters
for letting me do this and

38
00:02:46.723 --> 00:02:50.667
putting up with almost a 12 hour workshop.

39
00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.900
[LAUGH] Just nine hours.

40
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.677
Thank you so much.

41
00:02:54.677 --> 00:02:59.417
Thank you for letting me do this.
