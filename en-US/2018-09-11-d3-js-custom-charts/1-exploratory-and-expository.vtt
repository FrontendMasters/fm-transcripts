00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.879
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: To.
When I think of custom data visualization,

2
00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:08.040
usually we put them into
two very broad categories.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.693
And so those two broad categories,

4
00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:15.460
we think of them as expository
versus exploratory.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.200
Of course, there's steps in between,
but these are the kind of

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.600
opposite sides of the spectrum that
I want to talk about briefly today.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.420
So the way that I define expository is
that it's usually with a static data set.

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.474
And as we're going through and
trying to build the data visualization,

9
00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:36.341
we'll explore the data for
a story we want to tell.

10
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:39.972
So we're usually trying to
find some sort of insights or

11
00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:44.468
patterns or something to wrap into
a narrative that's compelling.

12
00:00:44.468 --> 00:00:47.874
And then we want to communicate
that story to the audience.

13
00:00:47.874 --> 00:00:52.158
So that is our main goal,
to communicate a story to the audience.

14
00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:56.063
And great examples of these
are New York Times, The Pudding,

15
00:00:56.063 --> 00:01:00.209
The Washington Post,
all the visual storytelling that they do.

16
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.403
I've been a fan of what
Pudding has been putting out

17
00:01:06.403 --> 00:01:10.696
just because I think they
have a little bit more

18
00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:15.669
breathing room than a lot
of the news organizations.

19
00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:17.910
Like the news organizations
a lot of times,

20
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.330
they have to put out
stories really quickly.

21
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.930
And so their visualizations might be,
they're really good but

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.072
they might be concise and a one pager.

23
00:01:26.072 --> 00:01:32.090
Whereas the Pudding, they've been putting
a lot of effort into visual storytelling.

24
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.523
And so
this one I really recommend as a great

25
00:01:36.523 --> 00:01:40.843
example of expository visualizations.

26
00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:45.873
And so, let's see,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This is one

27
00:01:45.873 --> 00:01:51.573
of the ones that they did where
they looked up film dialogue.

28
00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:58.430
And it says 2,000 screenplays
broken down by gender and age.

29
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.680
And so this is, I think,
one of their earliest works.

30
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.840
And they'll do these kinds of like,
as the story goes along,

31
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.570
the visualization matches that story.

32
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.464
So you can follow between the visual and

33
00:02:13.464 --> 00:02:16.892
the story at the same time.

34
00:02:16.892 --> 00:02:21.478
So there was another really
great one I saw recently.

35
00:02:21.478 --> 00:02:24.776
Well they had did a very great one on the,

36
00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:28.850
I don't know if [LAUGH]
it's appropriate to show or

37
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.313
not, but they did really great one on her,
Ally Wong.

38
00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:40.770
And they did a visualization that kind of
broke down the structure of her stand up.

39
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.390
I feel like a lot of visual storytelling
tends to be the scrolly, which I love,

40
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.120
because you can see the story being
reflected in the visualizations and

41
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.600
vice versa.

42
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.020
As the person scrolls, and it's so
common because especially on

43
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.540
mobile are the most basic of our
interactions, are scrolling.

44
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.050
So it works really well that way.

45
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.109
But this one, [LAUGH] PS,

46
00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.530
there's explicit content and audio.

47
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.540
I don't actually know.

48
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.040
So this one, though,
is one of the click through ones.

49
00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.457
But, I just want to show you actually,

50
00:03:20.457 --> 00:03:25.649
that's probably better,
because well, there is video.

51
00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:30.140
[LAUGH] But do you see how they're talking

52
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.890
about those circles that have shown up.

53
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.780
Those are them visualizing the laughter.

54
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.550
[LAUGH] So the size of the circles
are the size of the audience's laughter.

55
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.568
And I love this because if you
notice it's kind of an animation

56
00:03:52.568 --> 00:03:57.697
that it's like timed and
you just takes you through the story.

57
00:03:57.697 --> 00:04:02.161
And if you get impatient you can like
kind of trigger it to go faster.

58
00:04:02.161 --> 00:04:07.810
But it's not a form of visual storytelling
I've really seen done anywhere else.

59
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.875
And I think this was one
of their experimentations,

60
00:04:10.875 --> 00:04:15.331
cuz they do a lot of the scrolly telling,
but this was one of their, I think,

61
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:18.600
let's see if we can tell
a story a different way.

62
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.078
And I really love that.

63
00:04:21.078 --> 00:04:22.053
And then, and

64
00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:27.183
also they're just really great at
this whole visual storytelling thing.

65
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:30.237
I showed this at a Meet Up in Japan, and

66
00:04:30.237 --> 00:04:34.346
I had forgotten how rude and
vulgar our content is.

67
00:04:34.346 --> 00:04:38.257
And then she started twerking,
she started,

68
00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:41.676
and I was like, gosh no, I'm sorry.

69
00:04:41.676 --> 00:04:47.045
But yeah, so I
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, I wanted to use them

70
00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:52.140
as an example of
expository visualizations.

71
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.558
And so
if you ever are in need of inspiration or

72
00:04:56.558 --> 00:05:00.660
just want to keep up with them,
I highly recommend them.

73
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.173
And [LAUGH] on the other side is
the exploratory visualizations.

74
00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:12.082
And these are often times going
to be a dynamic dataset that

75
00:05:12.082 --> 00:05:15.898
you're probably pulling out of a database.

76
00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:20.884
And a lot of times,
it's you probably have stakeholders,

77
00:05:20.884 --> 00:05:28.080
who are trying to use this visualization
to potentially answer business questions.

78
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.160
So it's usually a visual tool
that you're building for

79
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.810
the stakeholders to explore
the data themselves.

80
00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.470
So instead of guiding your
readers through a story of

81
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.970
that already has
the things that you found.

82
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.650
You're building a visual tool to guide the
stakeholders and exploring the data and

83
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.950
finding the insights themselves.

84
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.769
And so, a lot of these,

85
00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:56.680
I think of as like scientific and
academic research, visualizations,

86
00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.970
internal business tools at some of those
giant, like Netflix, Uber, Airbnb, etc.

87
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.410
And unfortunately I don't
have examples to show you for

88
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.280
those cuz a lot of them
are like locked behind NDA.

89
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.920
And but it's really,
really interesting how similar

90
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:22.080
their use cases are to what I do a lot
in my freelance with expository.

91
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.220
But then they also,
I think it kind of also builds

92
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.900
on top of the skills sets you
need to do the static data set.

93
00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.842
I have a section at the very end that
talks about kind of the process for

94
00:06:38.842 --> 00:06:44.470
exploratory, and the advice for
building exploratory visual tools.

95
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:51.820
But today we're going to concentrate
on doing expository visualizations.

96
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.184
And then I think what you can learn and
take away from this,

97
00:06:57.184 --> 00:07:01.782
you can build on top of
that to do the exploratory,

98
00:07:01.782 --> 00:07:05.305
internal business analytics tools.

99
00:07:05.305 --> 00:07:11.963
So yeah, so today we're going to be
looking at a very specific data set.

100
00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:16.866
And I really I wondered for
a whole shower what kind of data set I

101
00:07:16.866 --> 00:07:21.310
should give you where everybody
will know the data set.

102
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.420
It's not so
specific that it alienates people.

103
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.890
And hopefully the top ten
blockbuster movies every year for

104
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.040
the last two decades,
hopefully that's pretty,

105
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:41.360
I guess cross cultural.

106
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.880
But these are I only made
it at the top US movies so

107
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:51.660
that we stick within one one culture and

108
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.150
hopefully we'll all be able to get
something out of this data set.

109
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:01.805
And the goal for this is to come up
with a design and implement together.

110
00:08:01.805 --> 00:08:06.932
So you might notice that you have
some markers in front of you and

111
00:08:06.932 --> 00:08:12.158
that is because there's going to
be some exercises in the middle

112
00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:16.933
in the design section where
you're going to draw things.

113
00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:21.696
And hopefully, we'll be able to
talk about them, share about them.

114
00:08:21.696 --> 00:08:28.376
And maybe give feedback so that people
that are watching this either at home or

115
00:08:28.376 --> 00:08:32.404
later on can kind of learn
from what we do here.

116
00:08:32.404 --> 00:08:36.075
So, that's the hope, so yay participation!

117
00:08:36.075 --> 00:08:43.530
[LAUGH] And along that line, if there's
ever anything that you're confused about,

118
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.520
please feel free to
kinda ask the questions.

119
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.440
Cuz that will make the workshop better for
everybody watching later also.

120
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.510
And I'm just to show you
this is the raw data.

121
00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.910
It's a little bit hard to
read cause it's just JSon but

122
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:06.050
it's basically the movies and there's a
lot of minute data on each of the movies.

123
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:09.400
But this is where you can get the raw
data if you're ever interested.
