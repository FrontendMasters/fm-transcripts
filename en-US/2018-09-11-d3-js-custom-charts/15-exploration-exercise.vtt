00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.430
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: If you go to this
part with the data exploration,

2
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.860
I also have the full version
of my notebook which

3
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.850
honestly I think isn't as good
as explorations we did today.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.410
So the way that I went was
a lot about seasonality.

5
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.600
The questions I had were like when
are most blockbusters released,

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.432
summertime, is it holidays.

7
00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:27.482
And I wondered about
the spread of metascores,

8
00:00:27.482 --> 00:00:31.090
what genres are common, and actors etc.

9
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:38.260
And then what I ended up finding is
I ended up doing some bar charts of

10
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.550
which months have the most
number of movies,

11
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.760
and like we saw with the heat map,
it tended to be summer or winter holidays.

12
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.380
And I looked at the different genres.

13
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.510
So I did a really ugly stacked bar
chart of all of the genres and

14
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.110
which months they were released
which turned out to be really ugly.

15
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.640
So I tried to do an area chart,
that was a little bit easier to read.

16
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.400
And so at the end, the thesis,
I wanted to design around

17
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.090
is these two points that I found that
blockbuster movies are highly seasonal.

18
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.260
And out of those, there are some
genres like action, adventure,

19
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.490
animation, etc, that are the most common.

20
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.180
I wanted to just kind of
go through a little bit of

21
00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.270
things that I've learned over the years
that have helped me a little bit.

22
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.800
Just because I don't come from a data
analysis background, data engineering, or

23
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.240
data science background, these are some
of the things that I've kind of

24
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.300
learned to do over the years to
help try and make up for that lag.

25
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.680
So the first one I mentioned
before is check for missing data.

26
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.200
And check for about the validity
of the data and then account for

27
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.900
that, either in going out and
getting the data or

28
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.565
noting in your kind of footnotes that
there are some data that are missing.

29
00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:09.819
And while you're going through and
exploring the data, try and

30
00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.543
focus on just one of the questions at
a time because it's very easy to get

31
00:02:14.543 --> 00:02:18.637
sidetracked with a tangent,
it's very easy to be like,

32
00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:22.707
this is super interesting,
let me go down this rabbit hole.

33
00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:27.578
Especially if you have a big, big dataset
that's really interesting, you might just

34
00:02:27.578 --> 00:02:32.380
get sidetracked by a bunch of different
tangents and not really get anywhere.

35
00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.460
So focus on just that one
question you started out with.

36
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.140
And try and figure out the answers for

37
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.740
that, dig into it until
you have a good answer.

38
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.073
But if there is an interesting tangent,
make a note about it for later because if

39
00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:54.080
your original question leads to a deadend,
then you can explore another

40
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.699
question on your list or that tangent you
found earlier that's really interesting.

41
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.540
And don't be afraid to go out and look for

42
00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.970
additional data to help
with your exploration.

43
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.150
And finally, sometimes when we find
no interesting patterns in our data,

44
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.200
that really is a very interesting point.

45
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.480
And one of the times when I really
learned that is I had a client project

46
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.490
with the Guardian about a dataset that was
about the homeless bussing in US cities.

47
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.640
And we were trying to look
at this bussing program

48
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.460
is where cities will buy a one way ticket
for homeless people to another city.

49
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.408
We were trying to find if
there was any seasonal trends,

50
00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:49.868
if people tended to get these bus tickets
more in summertime or something, or

51
00:03:49.868 --> 00:03:55.420
if there was trends in terms of geography
and we just couldn't find anything.

52
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.790
We couldn't find any interesting patterns.

53
00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.750
And that's when we realized the reason
why there's no interesting patterns

54
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.980
is because one of the requirements for
the bussing program is that

55
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.980
the homeless person has to have someone on
the other side in that destination city

56
00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.310
that will kind of receive them and
take care of them.

57
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.482
And so that's why there's no seasonal
patterns or geographic patterns because

58
00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:24.489
it's not people are traveling
at their own convenience,

59
00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:28.780
it's that they are traveling to someone,
a family member, or a friend or somebody

60
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.096
that can hopefully take care of them.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

61
00:04:34.096 --> 00:04:39.145
that's why there's no pattern
because it's more a random human

62
00:04:39.145 --> 00:04:44.951
connection sort of thing instead of
any seasonality or geographic thing.

63
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.715
And so that's when I learned new
interesting pattern is just as

64
00:04:48.715 --> 00:04:49.644
interesting.
