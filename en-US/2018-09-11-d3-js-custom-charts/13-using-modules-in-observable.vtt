&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So one of the questions
that got asked during the break is, well,

2
00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:07.280
first of all,
there seems to be a lot of love for

3
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.082
Observable and for Vega-Lite, for
which, I'm really, really glad.

4
00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:16.962
Again, I started using it in preparation
for this workshop and I've been loving

5
00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:21.716
kind of that process of being able to
take notes while doing data exploration.

6
00:00:21.716 --> 00:00:27.022
But one of the things that came up
during the break was this question

7
00:00:27.022 --> 00:00:33.199
about requiring, so some modules
are really easy to require in Observable.

8
00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.764
So for D3, it's just d3 = require('d3').

9
00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:41.670
And you can grab any package off of npm,
as long as it's been published on there.

10
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.447
But some of them are a little
bit more stubborn than D3.

11
00:00:45.447 --> 00:00:51.092
And in which case, there is a really great
Observable notebook by Tom MacWrigh,

12
00:00:51.092 --> 00:00:56.832
he is one of the engineers at Observable,
about how to require stubborn modules.

13
00:00:56.832 --> 00:01:02.126
And the one I really
like about this one is

14
00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:07.266
that he has some advice about depending

15
00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.641
on the package how to go about it.

16
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:17.074
But I tend to be really lazy,
so I like what he built,

17
00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:22.020
it's called a module require debugger.

18
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.630
And all you have to do is give
it a module name, hit Go,

19
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.330
and it will tell you what
is the best way to load it.

20
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.461
So let's do something like,

21
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:39.971
I recently used this
package to account for

22
00:01:39.971 --> 00:01:45.607
inflation in the box office figures,
so it tells me,

23
00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:51.018
okay, you can't just do
require us-inflation.

24
00:01:51.018 --> 00:01:55.605
This is probably the best
way to require it.

25
00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:58.994
Here's some other options
that are recommended,

26
00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:03.029
and here are some other options
that are not so recommended.

27
00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:07.214
And so this is also really great
as a resource if you're using

28
00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:09.849
Observable notebooks more and more.

29
00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.672
And there's some npm
package that you'll want,

30
00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:19.317
that just isn't getting loaded
correctly into Observable, I recommend

31
00:02:19.317 --> 00:02:24.705
this notebook to help you figure out
what the right require schema is.
