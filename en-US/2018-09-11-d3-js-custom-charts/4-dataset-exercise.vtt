00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So
the first data type is categorical.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.830
So in terms of the movie data set we have,
categorical could be the movie genres,

3
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.760
it could be the actor names, etc.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.535
Ordinal, I think of it as like
categorical, but with a specific order.

5
00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:25.985
And the most common example for that
is t-shirt sizes, small, medium, large.

6
00:00:27.922 --> 00:00:29.992
And then there is quantitative.

7
00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:35.402
So I think of those as, for example for
movies, I think of them as ratings,

8
00:00:35.402 --> 00:00:42.072
metascores, that could be from 0 to 100,
or yesterday we talked about temperatures.

9
00:00:42.072 --> 00:00:45.060
So temperatures,
degrees from 0 to 100, etc.

10
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.444
Temporal so dates, years, months, etc.

11
00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:57.863
And spatial, cities, countries, regions.

12
00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:03.680
And I wanted to talk about that
because when we go to this exercise

13
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.602
to do the data exploration I want us
to be able to open up the data and

14
00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:13.720
take a look at each of
what the data gives you.

15
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.678
There's a lot of attributes in here,
so this is basically,

16
00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:25.305
I don't think I cleaned it, I just wrote
some scripts to pull things off of IMDB.

17
00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:30.143
But this is not clean, and so this is very
similar to something like maybe a raw

18
00:01:30.143 --> 00:01:32.755
data set that you might get from a client.

19
00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:37.401
Or actually this is too nice to be a raw
data set you get from a client, but

20
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:38.881
maybe one step clean.

21
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.607
[LAUGH] But
it still looks a little bit hairy.

22
00:01:42.607 --> 00:01:49.193
And so what I want us to do is
list out attributes in here,

23
00:01:49.193 --> 00:01:53.257
and what type of data they are, and

24
00:01:53.257 --> 00:01:59.987
maybe bold them if they seem
like they might be relevant or

25
00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:04.072
important for analysis later on.

26
00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:08.452
And then we'll come back and we'll
talk about them after the ten minutes.
