00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This is
kind of the one I did.

2
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.045
It's a really rough drawing, and
it's a really quite simple one, too.

3
00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:11.323
And all it is is each of these peaks or
valleys are moving and

4
00:00:11.323 --> 00:00:15.199
what I wanted to show,
the main goal I had,

5
00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:19.111
was to show the seasonality of the movies.

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:23.948
And then also I just wanted to show
the different categories that might peak

7
00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:25.499
during those seasons.

8
00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:31.242
And so, I wanted to show each of
these curves are box office and

9
00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:36.103
the higher it is off of this
kind of like center line,

10
00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:40.872
the center line represents
the median box office.

11
00:00:40.872 --> 00:00:48.448
So the higher it is,
the more it went over the median and

12
00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:52.585
the lower is the less it made.

13
00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:58.673
And so, this is what I was also
talking about visual metaphors,

14
00:00:58.673 --> 00:01:01.510
so it did better so it goes up.

15
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.200
It's kind of like a curve up and
then it did worse, so

16
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710
it's kind of drooping down a little bit.

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.167
That's sort of a visual metaphor.

18
00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:21.155
And then I wanted to use textures to
denote summer and winter holidays.

19
00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:26.501
And I wanted to specifically use
textures so that there isn't,

20
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:31.357
cuz we already used this solid
color to color in the movie.

21
00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:35.581
So I wanted it to be textures
in the background so

22
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:41.610
that it's visually,
you can differentiate between them.

23
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.370
I have some notes to myself about, yeah so

24
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.310
denoting holidays as
cross hatch patterns and

25
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.120
maybe having horizontal lines across

26
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.488
to denote maybe 20 million or
50 million intervals for comparison.

27
00:02:02.488 --> 00:02:06.542
So this is just a really simplistic
sketch I did for myself.

28
00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:09.840
I think this is what I want
to have us building for

29
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.397
the rest of the class as we
go into the code section.
