&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So for readability,
you might have noticed that,

2
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.710
we have a bunch of pre-curves and maybe
this is really great for data art but

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.910
we're trying to do data virtualization.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.280
And so the number one thing that's really
important right now is readability,

5
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.530
because right now we can't really tell.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.110
We know what this represents but
if we put it in front of some readers,

7
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.860
they won't know what's happening.

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.168
So the number one important
thing after getting kind of just

9
00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:37.720
the data on there is to make
sure that the data is readable.

10
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.320
And to do that,
we want to be adding titles and

11
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
descriptions and
legends to explain the visualization.

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.710
And we want to add axes and annotations
to describe the data themselves.

13
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.200
And so these are axes.

14
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:03.320
I think these are really great if there's
very explicit xy coordinates, xy axes.

15
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.004
So these are really great for
labelling those.

16
00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:12.730
But sometimes especially if you have
color and there's no axes to label,

17
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.520
there's this really great library
by Susie Lu called d3-legend.

18
00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.199
That just takes in, it's quite
straightforward, it takes in a D3 scale,

19
00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:28.569
whether that's scale time or
scale legend or any of that.

20
00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:35.714
Sorry, scale ordinal or any of that and
it helps just generate a legend for

21
00:01:35.714 --> 00:01:40.455
you and so this makes it really,
really simple.

22
00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:45.287
So for example, for us,
we might want to be able to

23
00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:50.003
label the x axes and
the y axes with the d3 axis but

24
00:01:50.003 --> 00:01:54.951
then to show the colors we
might want to use Susie's

25
00:01:54.951 --> 00:02:00.273
d3-legend to say which
colors belong to what genre.

26
00:02:00.273 --> 00:02:01.192
And of course,

27
00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:05.663
annotations are really important to
call out different parts of the data.

28
00:02:05.663 --> 00:02:10.839
And say help guide the reader through
how to read your visualization.

29
00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:16.116
And maybe point out the interesting parts
that they should be paying attention to.

30
00:02:16.116 --> 00:02:19.967
And again, Aunt Susie is really,
really great at this and

31
00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:24.997
she's built this library called
d3-annotation, that with some setup,

32
00:02:24.997 --> 00:02:28.939
it makes writing these annotations really,
really easy.

33
00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.342
And she'll have ones where
you can do a circle or

34
00:02:33.342 --> 00:02:38.086
a rectangle or
even this kind of annotation badge.

35
00:02:38.086 --> 00:02:42.458
And these are things that are a little
bit cumbersome to do in SPG yourself and

36
00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:44.657
she makes that really, really easy.

37
00:02:44.657 --> 00:02:49.554
And in fact, all three of these kinds
of modules are things that are a little

38
00:02:49.554 --> 00:02:54.141
bit cumbersome to do in SPG if you
have to create the shapes yourself and

39
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:59.121
these kind of three modules help make
something that's really important,

40
00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:00.794
really easy for us to do.

41
00:03:00.794 --> 00:03:03.250
So I'm a fan,
big fan of all three of them.
