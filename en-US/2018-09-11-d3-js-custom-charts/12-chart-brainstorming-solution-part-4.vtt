WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.457
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's move on to
the next one, which I think was either

2
00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:11.047
a line chart or
a area chart of the genres over the years.

3
00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:17.805
So let's do that together,
and so what that would be is.

4
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:23.892
So for this one, we're trying

5
00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:29.276
to do the x axis is year, and

6
00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:37.252
the y axis is it was popularity, right?

7
00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:39.502
So popularity in this case,

8
00:00:39.502 --> 00:00:44.204
should we just go with metascore again for
the popularity?

9
00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:49.937
Okay,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Wait,

10
00:00:58.034 --> 00:01:00.550
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then it's going to

11
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.265
be colored by different genres.

12
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:09.347
Is color, one of the things
I do want to ask you that

13
00:01:09.347 --> 00:01:14.429
we need to take into
consideration is if you notice

14
00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:20.431
genres.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Usually

15
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.535
there are three genres together.

16
00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:24.042
How do you want to deal with that?

17
00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:27.519
Do you want to enumerate all of
the genres, or do you only want to take

18
00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.951
the first one, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We just chose the first one.

19
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:32.636
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's go with the easy one.

20
00:01:32.636 --> 00:01:36.550
[LAUGH] That's great,
let's just go with the easy one.

21
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.230
So in that case what we want to do is

22
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.090
let's go through this together.

23
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.186
So each of the marks are?
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Lines, thank you.

24
00:01:53.186 --> 00:02:00.418
And then coding is that
the x axis will be,

25
00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.720
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Type is temporal,

26
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.848
the field is a year, and

27
00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:17.287
there's no other things we need, right?

28
00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:19.847
And then y is,

29
00:02:24.172 --> 00:02:30.736
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The type is quant and

30
00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:36.142
the metascore is

31
00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:42.685
the field.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Metascore,

32
00:02:42.685 --> 00:02:47.912
and then with color we want
to say that type because

33
00:02:47.912 --> 00:02:53.147
genre is categorical we
wanna say it's nominal.

34
00:02:53.147 --> 00:02:59.389
And the field is the genre.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

35
00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:06.036
let's give that a try together.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

36
00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:11.133
the very first thing we have to do is
clean the data a little bit again.

37
00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:14.235
So this one is, let's say year.

38
00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:20.104
I'm really not that great with naming,
but let's say yearScoreGenre.

39
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.842
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And this one we want to

40
00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:33.744
get for each of the data,

41
00:03:33.744 --> 00:03:37.340
let us do return.

42
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.680
So we decided we want years,
well so, I have a question for you.

43
00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.050
Which is we have this string,
that's just the year.

44
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.600
And if we were to use this,

45
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.940
we would have to use type quantitative,
because it's not a date object.

46
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.620
Or we can use released,
and then tell it the,

47
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.710
and then tell it its temporal.

48
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.894
Should we try it released
with the temporal?

49
00:04:04.894 --> 00:04:10.150
Yeah, and see what happens.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

50
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:18.095
that was date is new Date(d.Released),

51
00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:23.034
score is just d.Metascore

52
00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:27.550
turned into an integer.

53
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.081
And genre we decided to just
take the very first genre.

54
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:39.282
But because it's currently in a string,
I need to split it by the commas and

55
00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:43.985
a white space, and
then take the very first one.

56
00:04:43.985 --> 00:04:51.381
So if we do that.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: d.genre or is that split?

57
00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:55.938
Cannot do split of undefined.

58
00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:01.659
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: There are undefined genres.

59
00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:10.314
Let's take a look at what that might be.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Actually I'll just do,

60
00:05:10.314 --> 00:05:16.173
it will be if there are genres then
will split them and if there aren't,

61
00:05:16.173 --> 00:05:22.000
let's just give it an empty string for
the sake of this exercise.

62
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.398
Okay, so this is the data processing, and

63
00:05:26.398 --> 00:05:31.596
let's look at the data really quickly, so.

64
00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:35.497
Wait, no, no, no, it's just genre,
there's no genres.

65
00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:41.996
So it's just Genre.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Perfect,

66
00:05:41.996 --> 00:05:48.498
so now let's try plugging this

67
00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:55.621
in to vegalite.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And see what happens.

68
00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:59.210
So again, we can do, and let me.

69
00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:08.738
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let me pin this code.

70
00:06:08.738 --> 00:06:15.142
Okay so let's try vegalite again.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

71
00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:22.236
again the data is the newly calculated
one which we call yearScoreGenre.

72
00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:27.713
The mark is line, and
the encodings we have,

73
00:06:27.713 --> 00:06:31.470
was it encoding or encodings?

74
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:36.540
Let me just see.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Just encoding, okay.

75
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.500
Encoding, and
we have three of them this time.

76
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.537
The x we wanted to be
the type is temporal.

77
00:06:48.196 --> 00:06:58.000
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then the field is date.

78
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.091
That should be it.

79
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:02.488
Y we said the type is quantitative.

80
00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:06.338
The field is the score.

81
00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:12.065
And finally the color we
set the type is nominal,

82
00:07:12.065 --> 00:07:18.674
and the field is genre.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

83
00:07:18.674 --> 00:07:24.106
then we need to put this into quotes.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Invalid

84
00:07:24.106 --> 00:07:28.320
field type undefined?
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: We have

85
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.900
an undefined field type?

86
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.073
Can anyone see-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quantitative is misspelled.

87
00:07:34.073 --> 00:07:35.276
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Thank you so much.

88
00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:42.301
[LAUGH] Quantitative, whoa.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: That's

89
00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:43.840
not what we were expecting.

90
00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.040
Just for
to make a little bit easier to read width,

91
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.830
I'm gonna start to a little bit bigger,
let's say 800 and see what happens.

92
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.008
Or maybe just 600, so it fits,

93
00:07:59.008 --> 00:08:02.473
and then let's bring it up.

94
00:08:02.473 --> 00:08:06.249
Not quite what we were hoping for, is it?

95
00:08:06.249 --> 00:08:11.251
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And that's fine,

96
00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:15.419
sometimes you're exploration
turns out really well and

97
00:08:15.419 --> 00:08:20.730
sometimes it just doesn't quite give
you back what you were hoping for.

98
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:25.820
If we had a bit more time what we might
try to do is, actually let's try and

99
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.990
see if we an make this into an area chart.

100
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.100
That's also really interesting in
a really hard to read sort of way.

101
00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.410
So yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It looks more like

102
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.792
generative art.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Actually,

103
00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:45.300
yeah this is hard to read.

104
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.568
And this is actually a really
good example of like,

105
00:08:48.568 --> 00:08:53.052
the reason why we're doing this is so
that we can quickly go through and

106
00:08:53.052 --> 00:08:57.384
also check out different visualizations
that might be good or bad.

107
00:08:57.384 --> 00:09:00.491
And now we can rule this out as like,

108
00:09:00.491 --> 00:09:04.645
we probably shouldn't do
an area chart [LAUGH].

109
00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:09.350
Or if we do an area chart or
a line chart or something similar,

110
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:14.909
we are going to have to be really
careful to make sure it's easy to read.

111
00:09:14.909 --> 00:09:17.977
Because, yeah, right now this is like,

112
00:09:17.977 --> 00:09:21.227
it's really hard to get
anything out of it.

113
00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:25.818
But again, if we have a bit more time,
maybe it's that we can try a different,

114
00:09:25.818 --> 00:09:28.410
we can try modifying
this a little bit more.

115
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:33.270
Maybe we only look at a certain
time range that we dig into,

116
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.415
or-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you do a scatter plot?

117
00:09:35.415 --> 00:09:36.824
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Scatter plots,

118
00:09:40.815 --> 00:09:43.210
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I don't know if scatter

119
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:48.493
plot would be the right way for
this one, we can try.

120
00:09:48.493 --> 00:09:51.491
Just cuz one temporal and
one is quantitative, and

121
00:09:51.491 --> 00:09:54.711
I actually don't know what
vegalite would do with it.

122
00:09:54.711 --> 00:09:56.046
But we can give it a try.

123
00:09:56.046 --> 00:09:58.749
Look at that.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: But

124
00:09:58.749 --> 00:10:03.378
scatterplots are usually you try and
look for correlations with it and

125
00:10:03.378 --> 00:10:05.664
then this case it's really hard.

126
00:10:05.664 --> 00:10:10.690
Like it's really hard to see really any

127
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:18.165
correlation with it other than
you know there are movies.

128
00:10:18.165 --> 00:10:25.101
[LAUGH] With scores and genres [LAUGH].

129
00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:29.664
So we can either conclude
that there is more

130
00:10:29.664 --> 00:10:34.371
work that should be done
here to massage it.

131
00:10:34.371 --> 00:10:38.830
Or we can conclude that there's just
not anything interesting to show here.

132
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.472
And for the sake of today's workshop,

133
00:10:41.472 --> 00:10:45.722
let's just conclude that maybe
this is one of those dead ends.

134
00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:49.571
So, [LAUGH] but this is a really
great example of a dead end.

135
00:10:49.571 --> 00:10:50.771
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It does seem like there's

136
00:10:50.771 --> 00:10:53.303
less comedies as you move to the right.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: [LAUGH]

137
00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:56.900
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] And animations only

138
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:01.693
started to gain popularity in 2003.

139
00:11:01.693 --> 00:11:03.052
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Thank you Mark.

140
00:11:03.052 --> 00:11:05.600
[LAUGH] For giving this a try.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm really taking

141
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.490
a shot in the dark here.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I mean these are some of

142
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.530
the things that you decide
to really dig into.
