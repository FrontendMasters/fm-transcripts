00:00:00.028 --> 00:00:03.505
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Now what I want to do
is go through the code together for

2
00:00:03.505 --> 00:00:06.382
creating these textures and drop shadows.

3
00:00:06.382 --> 00:00:13.244
So I want to add some background textures
for every summer and winter holidays.

4
00:00:13.244 --> 00:00:18.061
And then I want to add drop shadow to each
of the movies to kind of make them pop

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:19.292
out a little more.

6
00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:24.241
And instead of decoding them,
I'm just going to

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:29.720
go through and
talk through the code a little bit.

8
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.381
So the actual full code is in index.js if

9
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:38.767
you ever want a reference to them, but

10
00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:45.501
let us just I'm just going to copy and
paste over the code.

11
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:47.180
And I'm going to talk through them.

12
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.670
So here is the textures code.

13
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.483
And so what I've done here is I've created

14
00:00:57.483 --> 00:01:01.842
a data structure of just the holidays.

15
00:01:01.842 --> 00:01:07.586
And all it does is give me back
an array of every summer and

16
00:01:07.586 --> 00:01:11.988
I define that as between June and
August and

17
00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:16.770
every winter between November and
December.

18
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.379
And then I just say whether it's summer or
whether it's winter.

19
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.838
And then what I do with that
is I create two textures.

20
00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:31.139
So this is textures.js.

21
00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:35.459
And I tell it that I want some lines,
and for

22
00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:40.530
the summer,
I want to stroke it by an orange.

23
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.700
And for the winter,
I want to stroke it by a blue.

24
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.290
Unfortunately, as far as I know,
I don't think I can do SVG patterns.

25
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.291
I don't think I can do strokes or
fills dynamically, I could be wrong.

26
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:01.487
But it seems like with SVG patterns,
I have to create two different ones.

27
00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:06.507
Or at least with this textures.js library,
I have to create two different ones.

28
00:02:06.507 --> 00:02:10.772
Even though they look exactly the same and
only the stroke is different.

29
00:02:10.772 --> 00:02:19.285
But then I call these
two textures on the SVG.

30
00:02:19.285 --> 00:02:24.280
And underneath the hood,
what that is an and SVG def element.

31
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.610
And we can take a look at
that really quickly together.

32
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.150
SVG patterns are defined in these tags,
these elements called defs.

33
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.080
And so we'll define them and

34
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.300
we'll say in this case textures.js
is creating a pattern.

35
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.414
And then it's just creating this
path with these hash lines.

36
00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:52.134
And then we give it this unique ID.

37
00:02:52.134 --> 00:02:57.100
And the way that we use them is in

38
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.468
the SVG I will,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I

39
00:03:02.468 --> 00:03:06.912
will create some rectangles.

40
00:03:06.912 --> 00:03:11.689
And those rectangles
have x coordinates of,

41
00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.466
and the rectangles
are defined by the dates,

42
00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:21.002
the bounding dates that I gave it earlier.

43
00:03:21.002 --> 00:03:29.140
And then it just goes from the very top
to the very bottom of the SVG window.

44
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.518
And the way to use those
textures is to just say fill, and

45
00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:40.829
then a call url on
the texture we define above.

46
00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.772
So in this case I'm saying if
the type of the holiday is summer,

47
00:03:46.772 --> 00:03:50.595
grab the url ID from the summer texture.

48
00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:56.160
And if it is winter then grab
the url ID from the winter.

49
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.530
And I say instead of filling by some
solid color, fill by this pattern.

50
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.591
And that's how these textures are working.

51
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:11.876
So this is really fun because now there's
some context like look how many of

52
00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:18.781
these like Avatar is in the winter towards
the end of winter that must be December.

53
00:04:18.781 --> 00:04:24.643
And Star Wars, and
actually all three of these Star Wars

54
00:04:24.643 --> 00:04:30.263
movies it seems like are in
this December timeframe.

55
00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:35.146
And some of these like summer blockbusters
are either right in the middle of

56
00:04:35.146 --> 00:04:40.666
the summer or right like at the beginning
of like, this probably Memorial weekend.

57
00:04:40.666 --> 00:04:46.042
And so, I really like these
textures to give context of,

58
00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:53.098
we already have this x axis so we can
look and we can see which years they are.

59
00:04:53.098 --> 00:04:57.019
But now with a little bit
of additional information,

60
00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:01.824
like the gestalt laws of grouping
we were talking about earlier.

61
00:05:01.824 --> 00:05:04.300
And we talked about this
thing called enclosure.

62
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.400
And how you can like
shade certain areas and

63
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.190
that will look like an actual grouping.

64
00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.174
So I think this is also doing that.

65
00:05:15.174 --> 00:05:18.988
Yeah and I think this is also doing that.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

66
00:05:18.988 --> 00:05:22.513
that is textures.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

67
00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:27.328
that's a package that you pulled in?
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes, textures.js,

68
00:05:27.328 --> 00:05:32.387
it is here in my dependencies down here.

69
00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:37.500
Textures.js and up at the top I import it.

70
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.729
And again, a little bit more work but
I'm still not too bad

71
00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.088
to just do kind of that pattern and
the crosshatch pattern.

72
00:05:48.088 --> 00:05:49.873
Or just hatches?

73
00:05:49.873 --> 00:05:51.327
Hatches pattern.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

74
00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:56.467
if you type in SVG patterns
there's like a bazillion patterns.

75
00:05:56.467 --> 00:05:57.262
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Is there?

76
00:05:57.262 --> 00:05:57.971
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

77
00:05:57.971 --> 00:06:03.057
just Google SVG patterns and
then like hero pattern

78
00:06:03.057 --> 00:06:07.875
is right there.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And you could just put those

79
00:06:07.875 --> 00:06:11.522
into your defs and point the URL out.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Wow,

80
00:06:11.522 --> 00:06:16.705
I didn't know about this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's eight of these sites

81
00:06:16.705 --> 00:06:21.298
that have like hundreds of different.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This is amazing.

82
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:21.803
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really

83
00:06:21.803 --> 00:06:22.730
cool.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

84
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cuz I never thought about

85
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.962
overlaying these over your-
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

86
00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:28.616
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Charts,

87
00:06:28.616 --> 00:06:30.365
it's really cool.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah,

88
00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:32.671
I mean I wouldn't
recommend the busier ones.

89
00:06:32.671 --> 00:06:39.397
[LAUGH] I would keep it relatively simple,
but yeah, this is really cool to see.

90
00:06:39.397 --> 00:06:40.720
Actually, I really like this one.

91
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.039
[LAUGH] But, yeah,
it could give really good

92
00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.017
additional context to use one of these.

93
00:06:49.017 --> 00:06:51.779
Thank you for sharing this one,
hero patterns.

94
00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:57.600
I think I know about textures.js just cuz
it has built in D3 support, pretty much.

95
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.566
Or it's, I think, written with D3 is
what it looks like, but these are great.

96
00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:06.960
Because just like you say, just stick
them into the defs, give it a unique ID.

97
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.177
And then you can just reference them
from fill, and you say like url, and

98
00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:14.222
give the unique ID, and
that's all it takes.

99
00:07:14.222 --> 00:07:20.510
[COUGH] Using the pattens is not hard,
it's just writing the patterns,

100
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:22.960
defining the patterns,
that's just a little bit more work.
