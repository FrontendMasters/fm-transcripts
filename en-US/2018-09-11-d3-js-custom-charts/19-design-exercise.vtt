00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.930
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So I have an exercise.

2
00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.450
And this is again,
where we use our papers and our markers.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.430
And I want us to sketch all the things.

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.825
In particular,
choose your main message or messages,

5
00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:19.140
from kind of either what we were talking
before like from our own explorations.

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.824
I go back through our observable
notebooks together, I'm sorry,

7
00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:29.420
our observable notebook from earlier and
kind of the exploration we did.

8
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.550
I think I want to give you enough
time to do like maybe you can try out

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.700
a few more charts yourself to do the
exploration, but I would love it if you

10
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.560
can choose a main message and
if not from today's like if you want

11
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.940
to choose anything from the explanation
I've done, that's perfectly fine too.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.710
But find a main message and
then think about for

13
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.080
those main messages what
marks will you use?

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.220
And for for those marks, do they
represent individual data points or

15
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.950
are they aggregates of those data points?

16
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.750
And what channels will your marks use?

17
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.640
Like how do they support your message?

18
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.530
So, I want us to keep that in
mind as we're trying to design.

19
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.700
The design something and sketch.

20
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.750
So I want to give us at least 30 minutes
because I think this is a big one.

21
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.063
So at least 30 minutes and, again,

22
00:01:32.063 --> 00:01:38.079
the sketches don't have be fancy,
have fun with it.

23
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.987
I think If we can just concentrate

24
00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:47.916
on-
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Don't worry about good or

25
00:01:47.916 --> 00:01:50.045
bad when you're sketching it.

26
00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:54.358
Just put all of the ideas out there and
then maybe we can choose a few to talk

27
00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:58.769
about why some of them might be effective
and why some of them might not be.
