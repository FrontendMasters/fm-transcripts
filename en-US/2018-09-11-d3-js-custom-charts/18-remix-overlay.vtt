&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The last thing that I
want to talk about with the design

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.740
is this thing, remix and overlay.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.355
So my friend, Nadieh Bremer has a really
great quote that I really like which is,

4
00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.191
you don't always need
to start from scratch.

5
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:20.118
You don't need to be creating a brand
new custom data visualization that

6
00:00:20.118 --> 00:00:23.683
like nobody's ever seen
before every single time.

7
00:00:23.683 --> 00:00:27.170
A lot of times you can just
remix what's out there already,

8
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.658
like maybe it's just you see this
a really great example of the D3 gallery.

9
00:00:31.658 --> 00:00:36.804
And maybe it's that none
of these one thing help

10
00:00:36.804 --> 00:00:42.732
accomplish your goal of
communicating your message.

11
00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:46.810
But maybe if you combine one or
two of these together,

12
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.622
that's the design you need to be
able to get your point across.

13
00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:55.524
So that's another thing I really like.

14
00:00:55.524 --> 00:00:59.395
But make sure that the right visuals
to communicate your message.

15
00:00:59.395 --> 00:01:02.818
Don't just haphazardly be like,
this is pretty, and this is pretty.

16
00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:05.279
And this would look pretty together,
and like mash them together.

17
00:01:05.279 --> 00:01:09.264
Make sure that there's a reason, a rhyme
and reason to why you're doing this.
