00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:04.814
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So one of the first things
that we were talking about was how

2
00:00:04.814 --> 00:00:08.921
there's so
many more questions that we could be.

3
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:12.909
The more that we look at this dataset,
the more questions we have for it.

4
00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:18.606
One of the really good examples
that was brought up was for

5
00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:22.609
example, these box office figures.

6
00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.715
I mean, this one's not.

7
00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:29.651
But for these box office figures,
over time, over the years,

8
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:35.702
over the last two decades,
movie tickets have gone up in price.

9
00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.370
So how does that effect?

10
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.128
We have to take that into account for
the box office.

11
00:00:43.128 --> 00:00:49.363
For my examples, I've adjusted for
inflation for the box office figures.

12
00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:52.939
But that's only like
a partial stop gap for

13
00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:57.012
taking into account the rise
of movie tickets and

14
00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:00.897
we can talk a lot about how to account for
that.

15
00:01:00.897 --> 00:01:05.356
I think it's also
a potential design decision

16
00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:09.469
if we decide to use box office numbers,
but

17
00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:15.870
that then led into a really
interesting discussion about like

18
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.977
are there films that come out more in
recessions or are they more popular?

19
00:01:22.977 --> 00:01:24.930
Do they make more at the box office?

20
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.081
Or even like what kind of
genres during recessions?

21
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:31.025
And all of these are really
great questions.

22
00:01:31.025 --> 00:01:35.856
And from that, what I want to
emphasize is like this is a really,

23
00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:37.741
really simple dataset.

24
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.594
It only has 200 movies.

25
00:01:39.594 --> 00:01:44.696
And in those 200 movies like there's
only a handful of attributes,

26
00:01:44.696 --> 00:01:48.266
it's not even like one of those quote,
unquote,

27
00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:52.534
big data datasets that have thousands or
millions of rows.

28
00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:58.011
And even for such a small dataset, we
start having so many different questions.

29
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:02.892
So I think there's just so
many different avenues for exploration.

30
00:02:02.892 --> 00:02:07.881
So I want to reemphasize the fact that
one of the things that we want to focus

31
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:12.401
on is kind of that's why listing
all the questions are so helpful.

32
00:02:12.401 --> 00:02:17.161
And then from those questions like make
sure to focus on only one at a time to not

33
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:18.269
get distracted.

34
00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:23.609
And also once we finish with the
exploration to really just grab onto and

35
00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:29.394
focus onto one or two themes that we want
to build our visualizations around or

36
00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:34.111
if we want to build a series of
visualizations, then a series of

37
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:39.104
related themes that we can kind of
like kind of tell a story around.

38
00:02:39.104 --> 00:02:43.611
Don't go for every single possible
thing you can do with the data or

39
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:48.454
at least don't build a visualization
of every possible single thing.

40
00:02:48.454 --> 00:02:51.832
Build them around themes that makes sense.

41
00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:56.965
So that's one of the first things and
the second thing that

42
00:02:56.965 --> 00:03:01.699
I wanted to make sure to
cover was about data sources.

43
00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:06.472
So a really great question that came
up about like where to get data,

44
00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:12.519
because there are really good data sources
out there like with US Government Census.

45
00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.071
There is like a different
news organizations,

46
00:03:17.071 --> 00:03:22.531
I think like ProPublica is one
of those that over the years

47
00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:27.649
have kept a GitHub repo of
all of their data sources and

48
00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.980
there's all of these different.

49
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.130
Yeah, so I think I'm not sure
if they're up to date or not.

50
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.270
But there's all of these really
great different resources.

51
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.130
But the thing that I really want
to emphasize is that if you

52
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.370
are trying to build a visualization,

53
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.937
most of the times how I go about it
is instead of having a dataset and

54
00:03:52.937 --> 00:03:56.702
trying to build a visualization around it.

55
00:03:56.702 --> 00:04:02.308
I recommend find something
that you're interested in.

56
00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:06.667
Find a topic that you're
passionately curious about and

57
00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:11.037
then go out, and
find the corresponding data set for it.

58
00:04:11.037 --> 00:04:15.503
And I say that, because a lot of times,
if you do have that interest,

59
00:04:15.503 --> 00:04:20.046
if you do have that curiosity,
that will kind of first of all, you know

60
00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:24.897
that dataset a lot better like you'll
probably understand it a lot more and

61
00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.441
you'll have better questions for it.

62
00:04:27.441 --> 00:04:31.516
But also that excitement will also
carry you through the whole data

63
00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:33.124
visualization process.

64
00:04:33.124 --> 00:04:37.640
It's quite easy to get distracted, cuz
it's a very long process where you have to

65
00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.389
data design code like you might get
discouraged and you point of it.

66
00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.902
But if you have that excitement,
because you're trying to build this

67
00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:50.734
visualization to answer one of your
curiosities, one of your questions.

68
00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:55.718
If you think of yourself as your
the primary consumer of your

69
00:04:55.718 --> 00:05:00.303
visualization, that really
helps motivate you along

70
00:05:00.303 --> 00:05:04.601
the whole process of
building the visualization.

71
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:09.940
So those are the two things I
wanted to make sure to talk about.

72
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.243
And now that we've talked about it,
let's talk about the design.

73
00:05:16.243 --> 00:05:21.592
So I want to talk a little bit about
how to translate from the data,

74
00:05:21.592 --> 00:05:25.305
the data exploration we did,
to the design.

75
00:05:25.305 --> 00:05:29.282
And the way that I like to think about
it is when we start thinking about

76
00:05:29.282 --> 00:05:32.851
the design, concentrate,
always, always concentrate and

77
00:05:32.851 --> 00:05:36.777
keep your take aways of themes that
you want to communicate across.

78
00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:40.400
Always keep those in mind.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

79
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.950
then when you're thinking about that,
that kind of like sentence or two,

80
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.335
start thinking about what does
that mean in terms of the data?

81
00:05:49.335 --> 00:05:53.255
Does that mean showing individual or
aggregated elements?

82
00:05:53.255 --> 00:05:55.976
Which attributes does that mean?

83
00:05:55.976 --> 00:06:01.333
If, for example,
we wanted to show that if the message we

84
00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:06.693
wanted to kind of communicate
across was the seasonality

85
00:06:06.693 --> 00:06:10.950
that would be kind of the release dates or
so.

86
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.230
Start thinking about
just those attributes and

87
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:17.839
elements that we want to show,
what does that mean.

88
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.130
And then the number one thing
about data visualization

89
00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.170
is mapping those relevant data and
data attributes to visual elements.

90
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.952
And to do that,
I want to kind of go through

91
00:06:34.952 --> 00:06:39.597
a little bit of I guess guidelines to help

92
00:06:39.597 --> 00:06:44.123
with mapping data to visual elements.

93
00:06:44.123 --> 00:06:49.369
So one of my favorite ways
to think about that process

94
00:06:49.369 --> 00:06:56.301
is this thing called Marks &amp; Channels and
this is my own definition.

95
00:06:56.301 --> 00:07:01.758
The way that I think
about Marks &amp; Channels

96
00:07:01.758 --> 00:07:07.217
are Marks are where you
map an individual or

97
00:07:07.217 --> 00:07:13.749
aggregated data element
to a geographic element.

98
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:18.685
So map individual or
aggregated data elements to marks and

99
00:07:18.685 --> 00:07:22.016
then map data attributes to channels.

100
00:07:22.016 --> 00:07:28.109
And so what marks are,
are kind these simple geometric shapes.

101
00:07:28.109 --> 00:07:29.663
So they could be like points.

102
00:07:29.663 --> 00:07:33.215
They could be like lines, areas.

103
00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:41.204
And so I like to think of them as
usually I'll map a one of those.

104
00:07:41.204 --> 00:07:45.063
Let's say, one of those movies
to one of these points or

105
00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:48.760
one of these if we aggregate
a bunch of movies together

106
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.809
I might map them to an area or
something along those lines.

107
00:07:52.809 --> 00:07:57.524
So that's how I think about marks and
these examples are from a really,

108
00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:01.768
really great book from Tamara Munsner
who's a professor over at

109
00:08:01.768 --> 00:08:04.160
University of British Columbia.

110
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.107
And she has this textbook called
Visual Analysis in Design.

111
00:08:08.107 --> 00:08:11.352
And there's a whole chapter on marks and
channels there.

112
00:08:11.352 --> 00:08:16.315
And that was one of the most illuminating
things I feel like I've read

113
00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:18.551
about visualization design.

114
00:08:18.551 --> 00:08:21.455
So check out at least
that part of her book or

115
00:08:21.455 --> 00:08:25.590
any of her presentations about marks and
channels.

116
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.435
And channels are anything from,

117
00:08:29.435 --> 00:08:34.517
the examples that she gives are positions,

118
00:08:34.517 --> 00:08:38.100
color, shape, tilt, size.

119
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:43.902
And so these are kind of, I think
of them as how I map my attributes,

120
00:08:43.902 --> 00:08:46.620
so dates or metascores, etc.

121
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.430
And I map them to one of
these visual channels.

122
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.793
And the way that I kind of organize
them in my head is that for

123
00:08:54.793 --> 00:09:00.279
quantitative data types,
I tend to map them to positions.

124
00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:04.974
So any of these positions
along the horizontal axes,

125
00:09:04.974 --> 00:09:10.829
positions along vertical axes or
maybe even both x, y positions.

126
00:09:10.829 --> 00:09:15.850
I also like to map
quantitative attributes.

127
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:19.820
Quantitative data types to size.

128
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.250
So maybe to length or area.

129
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.680
I think this is ordered in
terms of effectiveness.

130
00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.073
I think length is pretty
effective area and

131
00:09:29.073 --> 00:09:32.340
volume is a little bit hard to
compare against each other.

132
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.170
And we'll talk about the effectiveness
of these channels in the next slide.

133
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.519
So position and size.

134
00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.905
And color, color if they're sequential, so

135
00:09:42.905 --> 00:09:50.105
if they go from lighter to darker or
diverging, so if they go from one color,

136
00:09:50.105 --> 00:09:55.180
meet somewhere in the middle and
then another color.

137
00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:57.710
You'll see that done a lot in heat maps or

138
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:04.540
in chloropleths in maps when you want
to color the intensity of something.

139
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.499
I do not recommend rainbows.

140
00:10:07.499 --> 00:10:11.055
[LAUGH] And there's a really great, so

141
00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:16.510
yesterday I mentioned this blog,
the Datawrapper blog.

142
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:22.096
And I mentioned yesterday,
they have a great series that are like,

143
00:10:22.096 --> 00:10:26.630
what to consider when doing something,
something.

144
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:31.541
And I want to mention this one,
what to consider when choosing colors for

145
00:10:31.541 --> 00:10:33.083
data visualization.

146
00:10:33.083 --> 00:10:37.285
And they'll talk about all
of those considerations,

147
00:10:37.285 --> 00:10:42.049
if it's something quantitative or
something categorical.

148
00:10:42.049 --> 00:10:43.759
How to improve them, etc.

149
00:10:43.759 --> 00:10:45.419
So this is a really great read.

150
00:10:45.419 --> 00:10:50.225
And I also want to mention,
I actually read through quite a bit of

151
00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:54.587
what they talk about,
like what kind of questions to ask,

152
00:10:54.587 --> 00:10:58.430
what questions to ask when
creating charts, etc.

153
00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:03.560
There's some really great
resources in the Datawrapper blog.

154
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.580
So make sure to check that out also.

155
00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.881
I'm not sponsored by them,
I just really like them.

156
00:11:11.881 --> 00:11:16.450
[LAUGH] I realize I've
been plugging them a lot.

157
00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:18.060
I love the work they do.

158
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.350
It's a lot based on academic research.

159
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.706
So I like reading through them.

160
00:11:21.706 --> 00:11:26.800
And I think they make me a better
designer, because I'm not a designer.

161
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.130
So I'm trying to teach myself.

162
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.870
So for categorical data types,
I think shapes.

163
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:38.150
So shapes are really great,
color, discrete colors.

164
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:44.570
I think I saw sketches that used
both shapes and colors earlier.

165
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:49.380
I put one in there myself.

166
00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:51.410
Textures, sometimes I'll use textures.

167
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:57.400
There's a really great library
called Textures.js that kind

168
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.719
of gives you some basic cross-hatches or
little dots.

169
00:12:02.719 --> 00:12:07.566
I wouldn't personally recommend
anymore than two or three.

170
00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:12.246
If you have less than two or
three categories, I recommend this.

171
00:12:12.246 --> 00:12:16.712
Anymore and
I think it gets way too overwhelming.

172
00:12:16.712 --> 00:12:20.113
But sometimes I'll find
myself using textures.

173
00:12:20.113 --> 00:12:24.770
And then temporal animations,
I put that in there.

174
00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:27.374
Even though it's not in here,

175
00:12:27.374 --> 00:12:32.691
sometimes I'll use animations
to denote the passage of time.

176
00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:37.426
So if I have something that's,
for example, for

177
00:12:37.426 --> 00:12:42.277
the movies maybe I'll
animate movies in depending

178
00:12:42.277 --> 00:12:46.720
on their release year or something.

179
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.130
And so, that's an option that's
really unique to the web.

180
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:54.130
And that's something that
we can do in the web.

181
00:12:54.130 --> 00:13:00.380
And I think definitely don't do
animation for the sake of animation.

182
00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.850
But I think one of the places
that really makes sense is when

183
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:05.370
showing the passage of time.

184
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:12.772
And in terms of animation,
I really, really enjoy GreenSock,

185
00:13:12.772 --> 00:13:17.250
which is this JavaScript library
that's really great for animation.

186
00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.730
I don't think we'll cover that today, but
I think there's probably really great

187
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.680
workshops out there on GreenSock.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: By Sarah Drasner.

188
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.562
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: By Sarah Drasner,

189
00:13:26.562 --> 00:13:28.619
did she do one for you or-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yea,

190
00:13:28.619 --> 00:13:34.324
she's got a in SVG animation course,
which covers GreenSock, but she's coming

191
00:13:34.324 --> 00:13:38.774
to do a version two soon, so she'll be-
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I'm gonna plug Sarah

192
00:13:38.774 --> 00:13:39.358
right now.

193
00:13:39.358 --> 00:13:42.698
Sarah Drasner is where I learned so much.

194
00:13:42.698 --> 00:13:47.090
Sarah Drasner and Val Head, I did one
of their web animation workshops.

195
00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:51.261
And I feel like that was one
of the things that changed my

196
00:13:51.261 --> 00:13:53.720
visualization game last year.

197
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.815
I think it had a huge impact on
how I think about visualizations.

198
00:13:58.815 --> 00:14:03.060
So GreenSock, SVG animations,
Sarah Drasner.

199
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.608
I'm a huge fan of Sarah.

200
00:14:04.608 --> 00:14:06.327
I really love Sarah.

201
00:14:06.327 --> 00:14:08.650
So a plug there.

202
00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.737
So yeah, we just talked about marks and
channels.

203
00:14:10.737 --> 00:14:15.233
Let's kinda go together a little bit and
talk about just these kind of really

204
00:14:15.233 --> 00:14:19.490
simple ones and what marks and
channels are being used here.

205
00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:23.972
You might have noticed that
this is very similar to how

206
00:14:23.972 --> 00:14:29.064
Vega-Lite structured their kind of,
I guess, settings.

207
00:14:29.064 --> 00:14:32.566
And when we were doing it in Vega-Lite,

208
00:14:32.566 --> 00:14:37.820
we were telling it marks, and
we were telling it encodings.

209
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.500
So you can kind of think of that
as the marks and channels here.

210
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.845
And so if we're looking at the bar chart,

211
00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:48.186
the marks would be,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: You can, you can.

212
00:14:48.186 --> 00:14:50.630
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Rectangles.

213
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:53.551
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, rectangles, bars,

214
00:14:53.551 --> 00:14:59.635
the channels here, x positions,
y positions or either x or

215
00:14:59.635 --> 00:15:07.230
height, or the way the that Tamara
describes it is the marks are bars.

216
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.714
And the channels in
the x-axis are categorical.

217
00:15:10.714 --> 00:15:15.528
And in the y-axis is quantitative.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: For

218
00:15:15.528 --> 00:15:17.470
this one, the marks are points.

219
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:20.350
And again, there's an x and y direction,

220
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.420
in this case both of
them are quantitative.

221
00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.930
This is kind of similar to
what we were talking about

222
00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.150
before with different chart types.

223
00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:33.001
This one, she added another channel and so

224
00:15:33.001 --> 00:15:40.290
she added color to denote category
of a potential data element.

225
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:45.488
And then, finally,
she added size as another channel

226
00:15:45.488 --> 00:15:52.582
to denote something quantitative.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

227
00:15:52.582 --> 00:15:55.843
when we're talking about these channels,

228
00:15:55.843 --> 00:16:00.170
we just talked about a lot of
different kinds of channels.

229
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:05.477
But obviously there's
Differences in the effectiveness

230
00:16:05.477 --> 00:16:10.237
of each of these channels, how we
process these, because at the end of

231
00:16:10.237 --> 00:16:15.016
the day with visualizations what
we're trying to do is comparisons.

232
00:16:15.016 --> 00:16:20.015
Comparing between different
points in the data.

233
00:16:20.015 --> 00:16:23.207
And so to do these comparisons,
some of them, some

234
00:16:23.207 --> 00:16:27.981
channels are going to be more effective
for doing comparisons than others.

235
00:16:27.981 --> 00:16:32.358
And so on this lefthand side,
we have the channels,

236
00:16:32.358 --> 00:16:35.450
she calls them magnitude channels.

237
00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:40.620
I think of them as like
the quantitative data types and so

238
00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:47.993
she says the ones that are positions on
common channels are the most effective.

239
00:16:47.993 --> 00:16:53.248
The ones in online scales,
I don't quite know what sort of situations

240
00:16:53.248 --> 00:16:58.830
these are used but positions on
online scales are less effective.

241
00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:00.840
She goes all the way down to, for example,

242
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:05.230
for when there's quantitative
like using color

243
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:12.190
isn't quite as effective as, say, using
position but if you do want to use color,

244
00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:17.600
use luminance from lighter to darker or
saturation.

245
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.195
Those are effective.

246
00:17:19.195 --> 00:17:22.195
And then at the very bottom,

247
00:17:22.195 --> 00:17:28.329
the least effective is using curvature and
using volume.

248
00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:33.437
It's harder for us to be able
to compare areas or volumes and

249
00:17:33.437 --> 00:17:39.750
see kind of exactly how different
they are, relative to each other.

250
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:44.160
And so this is kind of that scale and,

251
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:48.370
on the other hand, with the categorical
attributes, you can see my

252
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.490
color is actually quite high on
there unlike when it was used for

253
00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.540
the quantitative with categorical
colors really, really effective.

254
00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.560
And this one was really interesting.

255
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.900
So motion, I was like,
what does the motion mean?

256
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:15.950
And I learned that we, as humans,
perceive motion really well.

257
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.490
Our eyes go to anything that's moving and
kind of

258
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:25.160
a crowd of things that's not moving,
our attention is drawn there right away.

259
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:32.270
But one of my beta testers told me that
even though we detect motion really well,

260
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.950
we aren't really great at detecting
subtle differences in the motion,

261
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:40.380
so motion is not great
if you want to do it in

262
00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:44.960
one of these quantitative Attributes
of like if you want to be showing like

263
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:49.500
a little bit of motion versus a little bit
more of motion and that's not great but

264
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.420
if you just it's either is motion or
isn't motion then it's really great.

265
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.234
So I learned something new there
that I really liked so and

266
00:18:59.234 --> 00:19:06.451
then she says shape is a little bit less.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Effective

267
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:07.950
than the rest of them.

268
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:13.092
So I think this is really
great guidelines and

269
00:19:13.092 --> 00:19:18.371
especially helpful because
this is how you can

270
00:19:18.371 --> 00:19:24.477
map the data attributes that
are the most important.

271
00:19:24.477 --> 00:19:29.972
To these, and to these channels
that are the most effective.

272
00:19:29.972 --> 00:19:34.694
So like, for
example in our earlier exploration.

273
00:19:34.694 --> 00:19:37.543
Let's say I'm gonna come back
to the seasonality example.

274
00:19:37.543 --> 00:19:42.103
But like, let's say seasonality to us is
the most important thing that we want to

275
00:19:42.103 --> 00:19:43.658
be communicating across.

276
00:19:43.658 --> 00:19:49.472
Well then in that case let's
Let's put the release states,

277
00:19:49.472 --> 00:19:54.146
let's map that onto
a position on common skill.

278
00:19:54.146 --> 00:19:56.186
So let's map that to the x-axis.

279
00:19:56.186 --> 00:19:58.205
So something like that.

280
00:19:58.205 --> 00:20:03.808
But for the sake of,
Argument I'm maybe the metascore

281
00:20:03.808 --> 00:20:09.304
is something that we're not we
want people to know about it but

282
00:20:09.304 --> 00:20:15.134
it's not the most important thing for
us to communicate across.

283
00:20:15.134 --> 00:20:18.670
Maybe that's something we map
to the color saturation or

284
00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.607
color luminescence down here because even
though we want them to know about it We

285
00:20:23.607 --> 00:20:28.193
don't want them to concentrate on it
as much as say the seasonality part.

286
00:20:28.193 --> 00:20:31.957
So this is kind of the scale
of effectiveness and

287
00:20:31.957 --> 00:20:37.506
what you can keep in mind as your
figuring out which parts of the data and

288
00:20:37.506 --> 00:20:40.162
how to map that data to channels.

289
00:20:40.162 --> 00:20:41.749
And it's just a really great guideline.

290
00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.450
So when I think about marks and
channels I think of it as

291
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:52.440
a one to one mapping of data to channel.

292
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:56.910
So that dates to an x access or

293
00:20:56.910 --> 00:21:01.400
the genre to a categorical color
etcetera a one to one mapping

294
00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:06.600
But, you can have multiple
mappings of a channel to a mark.

295
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:11.410
So for example maybe you do have
those points and you can map, in

296
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:18.130
the latest example, you can map X
position, Y position, size, color,

297
00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:23.310
excetera to just one of the bars But,

298
00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:27.190
do not ever map multiple data
attributes to the same channel.

299
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:30.390
Like that could be potentially
really really confusing, right?

300
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:35.140
Like if you decide that genres
are gonna be categorical colors,

301
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.220
but also actors are gonna be colors also.

302
00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:44.250
That's just gonna be like you're
It's going to be an over,

303
00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:48.850
not an oversaturation, but
it's going to be confounding

304
00:21:48.850 --> 00:21:52.960
to be mapping those two
to the same channel.

305
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.240
So that's how I think about it.

306
00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.460
One to one of data to channel.

307
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:01.044
Many to one of channel to mark
