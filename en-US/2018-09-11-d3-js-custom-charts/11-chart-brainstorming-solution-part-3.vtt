00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.670
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: One of the things
that I tried to do is,

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.300
after I take a look at the chart,

3
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.210
I tried to jot down some thoughts,
some notes of what might be interesting,

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.210
so that after all of the data exploration,
when I'm trying to come up

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.760
with a summary, or a message that
I'm trying to communicate it's

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.460
easier to go through all of my exploration
and figure out what might be interesting.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.120
So for this one, let's kinda list
together like what interesting things

8
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.820
jump out to you when you look at this?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like

9
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.420
you said I think those
outliers are interesting.

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.150
Like most of the points all
kind of generally together and

11
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.980
then there's a few movies that are just

12
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.298
through the roof better on both scores and
wins.

13
00:00:55.298 --> 00:01:00.646
So can we categorize those movies somehow?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Most

14
00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:04.800
movies are clustered together, but

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.294
there are some outliers
with 200 plus wins and

16
00:01:10.294 --> 00:01:13.120
almost 100% score.

17
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.735
So then the thought process is,
can we figure out categories,

18
00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:24.350
like figure out their genres,
what movies are they?

19
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.360
What are their genres?

20
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.017
Kind of further exploration into that and
that would be really fun.

21
00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:37.846
Maybe it's that I think maybe
from here what might be other

22
00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:43.074
interesting exploration is
looking at only those above 80 or

23
00:01:43.074 --> 00:01:45.952
only looking at those below 80.

24
00:01:45.952 --> 00:01:51.847
And then, just because right now it's
great to be able to see this trend,

25
00:01:51.847 --> 00:01:57.172
but then all of the things below
80 are getting really squished,

26
00:01:57.172 --> 00:01:59.643
but if we only look at those, or

27
00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:05.010
even only the ones below let's say 70 and
under 50 award wins.

28
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.300
And then you can kind of see
the correlation there a lot better.

29
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.390
Cuz it will open up and
they will be less squished.

30
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.789
I think that will be
something I'll look into.

31
00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:20.087
Also look at movies that have 80% or

32
00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:26.610
more.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Or only movies that have,

33
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.350
let's say, 80% less than 70%,
or something like that.

34
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.780
So those are further explorations I
would that we could potentially do.

35
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.950
We won't do it right now but
I think if we are actually

36
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.370
building something those are little
insights and tangents that we will follow.
