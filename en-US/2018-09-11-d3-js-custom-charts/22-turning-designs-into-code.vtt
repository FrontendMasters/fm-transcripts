&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's
talk a little bit about

2
00:00:04.516 --> 00:00:09.399
turning our designs into code.

3
00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:11.644
Again, I do not want to go through and

4
00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:14.620
implement every single
part of the D3 library.

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.074
But instead, I'm hoping to just kind
of talk about when you have a design,

6
00:00:20.074 --> 00:00:24.248
how can you break that down
into different parts to code.

7
00:00:24.248 --> 00:00:28.230
So, turning design into code,
break it down.

8
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.527
So think about what do you need
to draw each of the marks,

9
00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:34.555
what do you need to calculate
each of the channels?

10
00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:38.742
And so when I think about it,
oftentimes to draw each

11
00:00:38.742 --> 00:00:44.120
of the marks that comes down to SVG or
Canvas in the browser.

12
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.490
And to calculate the channels,
oftentimes I'll use D3 scales or

13
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.838
any of the shapes that they have,
or the layouts that they have.

14
00:00:51.838 --> 00:00:55.060
Or sometimes like, D3 doesn't have that.

15
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.324
And I'll go like, Google search for

16
00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:03.168
maybe another node package
that has a layout I want, or

17
00:01:03.168 --> 00:01:08.452
I'll just straight up,
sit down and calculate with math.

18
00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:13.595
[LAUGH] So
that's kind of how I think it through.

19
00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:20.841
And a little bit on SVG elements.

20
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:27.487
The ones I use the most commonly,
are rectangles, circles, text and paths.

21
00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:31.242
And I don't think we'll go into too much

22
00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:35.337
detail into this class
about each of these.

23
00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:40.179
But this is kind of what I keep in mind
when I think about converting from

24
00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:41.338
design to code.

25
00:01:41.338 --> 00:01:45.035
For each of the things that we drew,

26
00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:50.100
how does this convert to
each of these elements?

27
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.413
Or how do any of the things
that we drew out,

28
00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:58.309
and what does that, what is that
made out of in terms of the SVG?

29
00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:04.610
So I can see that this hanky is
going to be an SVG path element, and

30
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.375
most likely this radial is going
to be a path elements too.

31
00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:15.361
But these production company bars,
these are gonna be rectangles, etc.

32
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:18.109
And I'll sit down and
break it down to just,

33
00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.570
what does it take to draw these shapes?
