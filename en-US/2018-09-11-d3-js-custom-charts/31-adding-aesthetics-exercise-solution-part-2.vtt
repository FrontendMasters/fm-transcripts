00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.857
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The other thing that I want
us to do is to just give a little bit

2
00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:06.227
of a box shadow.

3
00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:10.854
One of the things that I
realize now is that I actually,

4
00:00:10.854 --> 00:00:16.300
if we have more time what I want to
do is sort each of these curves.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:22.554
So that the ordering of these SVG elements
are the ones that are the tallest,

6
00:00:22.554 --> 00:00:28.630
go to the very back and the ones that
are shortest, come to the very front.

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.070
So that you can see every
single one of these curves.

8
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.239
And I would just go back in and
sort it by the absolute

9
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.600
figure of a box office minus,
the meme box.

10
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.840
Then, let's copy over the drop shadow.

11
00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.593
So this is the DropShadow.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

12
00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:04.651
I'm going to put that up top.

13
00:01:09.808 --> 00:01:12.045
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So this is the DropShadow.

14
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.390
And I had a lot of help from
Nadia's baby spike code.

15
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.470
And so, these SVG filters a lot of them

16
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.230
are defined by you have some sort of
either you have a source coming in or

17
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.450
it just starts out with just that
filter and then you have a result.

18
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.369
And so what we want to do with
a drop shadow is, in our case,

19
00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.249
I just want to add a little
bit of a color matrix filter.

20
00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:53.565
And what that does is whatever source
it just applies this color to it, and

21
00:01:53.565 --> 00:01:59.465
this color looks, so
this matrices is really confusing but

22
00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:04.779
how you read it is this is the channel for
R,G,B,A.

23
00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:09.391
I don't really know exactly like how
to manipulate it more than just this.

24
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:14.100
And so,
in this case what I'm saying is everything

25
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.069
that comes in I just want
to turn into 30% opacity.

26
00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.810
And then with this color matrix,
I combine that with a GaussianBlur,

27
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.690
and I say a standard deviation of 3,
so it blows it out a little bit.

28
00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.370
And then, I say, so
the result of the car matrix

29
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.050
I take into here and I blur it and
then I call that result colorBlur.

30
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.506
And then,
I just say let's merge the result

31
00:02:50.506 --> 00:02:56.996
of those two the colorBlur
with the source graphic,

32
00:02:56.996 --> 00:03:01.881
and that's how you make a drop shadow.

33
00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:06.598
[LAUGH] I actually had a lot of fun,
cuz SVG filters

34
00:03:06.598 --> 00:03:10.906
is one of those things that are-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's like eight ways

35
00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:12.675
to do a DropShadow.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

36
00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:14.713
Yeah, so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's like a million

37
00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:17.873
different ways that you can copy and
paste off different sites.

38
00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:18.827
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, and

39
00:03:18.827 --> 00:03:24.351
Mark you know a lot about SVG, right?
&gt;&gt; Mark: Yeah.

40
00:03:24.351 --> 00:03:26.844
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So apparently there's now,

41
00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:30.340
also just like a filter call drop shadow.

42
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.408
And that's the equivalent
of running a GaussianBlur,

43
00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:36.290
offsetting that GaussianBlur
by a certain amount.

44
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.890
And then,
I believe flood is just how the light

45
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.930
is being cast onto the element,
that's my best understanding of flood.

46
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:55.370
And then, you merge all of that together
and that's the drop shadow right here.

47
00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.740
And then I tried this at first and
it was just way too harsh and

48
00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.960
I really preferred the way that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right there you

49
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.180
were just on it see it says feDropShadow.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

50
00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's like super easy,

51
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.290
it used to be like you were showing.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, so it used to.

52
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.190
Sorry?

53
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.714
Yeah, this one is basically if you

54
00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:23.556
drop shadow takes the place of this.

55
00:04:23.556 --> 00:04:27.825
And then now all we have
to do is feDropShadow.

56
00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:31.997
And I actually tried this out first, and I
just really didn't like how harsh it was.

57
00:04:31.997 --> 00:04:37.701
It was just really, really black, and
it just looked really kind of horrendous.

58
00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:42.396
And so, that's why I tried
out the way that Nadi did it.

59
00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:46.654
And I like how soft of
a drop shadow it is.

60
00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:51.966
And so the way that we do it is
just like with the textures,

61
00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:56.300
i have kind of defined
this with the ID shadow.

62
00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.490
And i just say,
i want to give a style of a filter and

63
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:11.510
that filter is called url(#shadow) and

64
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.217
that,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Should

65
00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:18.260
give me the drop shadows.

66
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.400
So yeah, I think drop, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

67
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.550
you can do like flood opacity it,

68
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.830
which should do the same thing.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: feDropShadow.

69
00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:29.442
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay, so

70
00:05:29.442 --> 00:05:31.460
combine the feDropShadow with.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,

71
00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.130
there's an attribute on feDropShadow,
which is flow opacity and

72
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.130
if you change that to point three or
upward, that'll do the same thing.

73
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.860
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Oh,is that said here or

74
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.110
is it in the.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No it's not.

75
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.782
The SVG documentation on MVM
is not exhaustive at all.

76
00:05:51.782 --> 00:05:54.869
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Is it this one, no, so

77
00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:58.443
I can say feDropShadow and

78
00:05:58.443 --> 00:06:03.593
go w3c?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know where would

79
00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:08.357
be a complete reference, but yeah,

80
00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:14.275
maybe w3 that would work.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let me try this one maybe?

81
00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:16.212
feDropShadow.

82
00:06:16.212 --> 00:06:20.685
And this one says I can-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's flood

83
00:06:20.685 --> 00:06:23.959
opacity.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Cool, wait, unfortunately

84
00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:27.990
where does it say flood opacity?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know.

85
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Number three.

86
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.050
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Number three, feflood,

87
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.480
flood opacity.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, there you go.

88
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.970
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Wow, thank you so much.

89
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.053
I didn't know this,
I'm quite bad with VSG filters.

90
00:06:42.053 --> 00:06:44.596
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nobody is good with,

91
00:06:44.596 --> 00:06:48.053
it's like so new that it's sort of,

92
00:06:48.053 --> 00:06:52.361
I mean it works in browsers, but-
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I think one of those things

93
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:55.235
I'm trying to get a bit better.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When MDN isn't complete on

94
00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:58.494
a topic, you know that,
pretty much, very few people.

95
00:06:58.494 --> 00:07:00.576
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: It's pretty [LAUGH].

96
00:07:00.576 --> 00:07:03.000
I hope to get better at them,

97
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.444
I want to get better at like
kind of composing them but

98
00:07:07.444 --> 00:07:12.696
I think for a lot of uses cases we
can probably just like copy and

99
00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:16.231
paste the definitions from somewhere and

100
00:07:16.231 --> 00:07:22.850
then all we have to do is use that
in a styling or something like that.

101
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.410
But I like just knowing what I'm using.

102
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.940
And that was the DropShadow.

103
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.700
So it adds that little bit of
a nice kind of pop effect.

104
00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:38.858
Does absolutely nothing for
actually the visualization like,

105
00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:41.635
communicating anything across.

106
00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:46.515
But I think it's one of those,
these are kind of the little details that

107
00:07:46.515 --> 00:07:50.775
help make a visualization just
a little bit more pleasing to look at.
