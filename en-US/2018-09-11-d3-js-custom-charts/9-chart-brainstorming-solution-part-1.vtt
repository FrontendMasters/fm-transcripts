00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.390
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay I'm really,
really, really excited about this.

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.360
These are some of the sketches
that came out of the break.

3
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.810
And so the ask was just to sketch

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.300
out some simple charts
to do the exploration.

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.190
Just think of some of the questions and
then what charts might be good.

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.930
And so what I want to do is go
through some of these and then

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.740
maybe do two or
three of these in Vega Lite.

8
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.140
I'm going to have to admit that I''m
not going to remember how to do

9
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.770
all of them off the top of
my memory in Vega Lite so

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.340
there might be some searching
of the documentation together.

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.390
But I think that will be
good because inevitably,

12
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.610
that's something that
we're going to have to do.

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.450
So this one is beautiful.

14
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.290
But looking at the question of is
there any relationship between

15
00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.200
the number of wins and popularity.

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.800
I think some of these are symbols,
so number of wins, so rating type?

17
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.170
So it's like IMDB rating,
meta score versus Rotten Tomatoes,

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.210
that would be really, really interesting.

19
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.930
That's a great one and then sized by
the box office number of wins, ratings.

20
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.930
So this one is looking at box office and
production company, is it?

21
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.080
And then bucket the number of wins,

22
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.780
sorry can you explain this
one a little bit more or.

23
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
I think this one is less well thought out.

24
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.840
Originally I was thinking
a distribution by box office sales, and

25
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.126
then you can have a stacked chart
that showed the number of wins.

26
00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:49.830
Kind of thought that maybe 0 to 5 is
light blue, 5 to 10 is dark blue.

27
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.904
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I think maybe for this one,

28
00:01:55.904 --> 00:02:02.920
so you're saying it's a histogram and
the x-axis is box office figures, right?

29
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.740
And so bucket the number of wins.

30
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:13.530
Actually I think maybe it should be that
the colors are the production companies.

31
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.830
Cuz the production companies
are categorical and

32
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.100
specific colors are really great for
categorical.

33
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.800
Let's see some of these others.

34
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.940
So, and then there's also these
are movies by release date.

35
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.610
Okay, so out of these,
which one are you most curious about

36
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.420
to just kind of give a try?

37
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.686
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I like the bottom left
one with just the histogram of ratings,

38
00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:49.642
and then you could bucket
total wins by genre.

39
00:02:49.642 --> 00:02:51.507
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So this, wait, left one?

40
00:02:51.507 --> 00:02:52.428
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That one.

41
00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:53.367
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay, cool.

42
00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:58.514
So total wins, so
percent readings, and then so

43
00:02:58.514 --> 00:03:04.424
this is going to be, okay,
it's going to be numbered.

44
00:03:04.424 --> 00:03:06.742
And then color by genre.

45
00:03:06.742 --> 00:03:08.263
So let's do this one together.

46
00:03:08.263 --> 00:03:12.195
But let's start out a little bit simpler.

47
00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:17.556
Let's take out the genre part,
let's not color by genre first.

48
00:03:17.556 --> 00:03:23.357
Let's only do the rating,
bucket it by rating,

49
00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:27.750
and then by the number of total wins.

50
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.020
Let's take a look at that, and
then we'll try the colors.

51
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.030
So this is really cool, this is
the number of wins versus the popularity.

52
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.810
And then we can actually, and

53
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.200
then so I think what I want to
do is I think there was, so this

54
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.700
is looking at the popularity of
genre over the years, right?

55
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Over the months.

56
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.470
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Over the months,
this is over the months.

57
00:03:58.911 --> 00:04:04.286
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, the idea is that you
could potentially select a range of years

58
00:04:04.286 --> 00:04:10.338
to see per month, what other certain
genres are popular at a certain month.

59
00:04:10.338 --> 00:04:10.978
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, I love it.

60
00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:15.782
So I think there was another one
that was going to be sort of

61
00:04:15.782 --> 00:04:17.995
like a stacked bar chart.

62
00:04:17.995 --> 00:04:24.587
It was a similar thing but in popularity
of different genres over the years,

63
00:04:24.587 --> 00:04:30.880
and you wanted to do a stacked bar
chart where the x-axis is, the years?

64
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.312
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]
Underneath is that.

65
00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:39.074
So this is,
each genre would get a color, and

66
00:04:39.074 --> 00:04:44.039
you would have the popularity
as the axis on the left there.

67
00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.367
It's as simple as it sounds,
it's a line chart with categories.

68
00:04:49.367 --> 00:04:54.497
But what we liked about it was
if you're dealing with a large

69
00:04:54.497 --> 00:04:59.742
range the heat map becomes very
difficult to discriminate.

70
00:04:59.742 --> 00:05:02.761
So when your bins are getting
to be very small and

71
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:05.854
vertical width,
I think a line does a much better

72
00:05:05.854 --> 00:05:11.010
job of representing the essential
structure of what we're trying to show.

73
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.816
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay, so let's do this.

74
00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:17.460
Let's first look at that question about

75
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.480
wins versus popularity,
and then let's go and

76
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:27.800
try this as both a line chart, like either
a stack bar chart or an area chart.

77
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.310
it's pretty easy to switch between them,
so let's try that.

78
00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.680
And then at the end let's
try the heat map and

79
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.660
let's see what we learned
from each of these.

80
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.160
This is quite exciting.

81
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.850
So let's start out with this question.

82
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:49.547
So let me see if I can
zoom in to just that part.

83
00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:54.936
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So let's try and
figure out how to do this one together.

84
00:05:54.936 --> 00:06:02.903
So I have a digital
version of a white board
