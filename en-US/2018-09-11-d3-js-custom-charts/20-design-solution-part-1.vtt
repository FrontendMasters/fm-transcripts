WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.966
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So this is some
of the sketches that we got, and

2
00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:06.017
I wanted to talk about.

3
00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:11.839
So the exercise was to look at
the data exploration we did and

4
00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:19.882
figure out if there's any main kind of
takeaways that we wanted to design around.

5
00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:22.610
And so think we got two of these.

6
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.910
And so this one looks like Sankey diagram.

7
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.050
Okay, so you're basically saying you
are filtering down the actors and

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.070
directors by a certain, you're not showing
the whole dataset of actors and directors.

9
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.120
You're filtering them down by
maybe just the ones that have

10
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.170
interesting correlations between
the actor, director, genre.

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.845
But that's a design decision you made and

12
00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.140
that's something you want
to say in the footnote.

13
00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.950
So, I think this is super interesting.

14
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.380
This is modeled after a sankey diagram.

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.540
So sankey diagrams look like this.

16
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.220
Well the one in D3, I think this is, the
one in D3 looks a little bit like this.

17
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.470
I haven't personally used that
many sankey diagrams, but

18
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.240
sankey diagrams, to my understanding,
is really great for flows.

19
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.479
So I've seen sankey diagrams used for
looking at how people navigate

20
00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.279
between pages and the ways that they go or
something like that.

21
00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:28.869
So it's really interesting to see
sankey diagram applied to the actor,

22
00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.157
director, genre.

23
00:01:30.157 --> 00:01:35.270
I don't know if that's as much
of a flow between each of them.

24
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.350
And that's one of the things that's
really great and unique about the web and

25
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.310
this tool that we have.

26
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.910
Which is that the interactions
are possible and for the clarity,

27
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.698
for making sure there's
clarity in the visualization.

28
00:01:48.698 --> 00:01:52.360
I like that idea of being able
to hover one of the lines and

29
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.860
see as it goes all the way through
from actor to director to genre.

30
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.960
I think another thing that might be really
interesting is at the very beginning of

31
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.930
the class you said you were interesting
in seeing these actor-directors and

32
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.510
how they might contribute to revenue.

33
00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.850
And so If this can be visually fit in,

34
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.440
maybe it would be interesting to say that
each of these lines actually represent,

35
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.900
the height of these lines actually
represent the box office revenue of that

36
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.860
particular movie that had that actor
with that director with that genre.

37
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.600
I think that would be really,
really interesting.

38
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.650
So and then we might be able to see if

39
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.720
these sets of actors always work with
this director in this particular genre.

40
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.840
And I will also encourage
you to sketch out a few

41
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.920
other ideas around this central theme.

42
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.620
And see which one works the best.

43
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.640
But this would definitely be interesting.

44
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.260
I think it's a really interesting
application of a flow diagram.

45
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.920
I don't know off the top
of my head if it's

46
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.410
the most straight forward, I guess, but
I think it's definitely worth trying out.

47
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.720
So that's really cool, thank you so much.

48
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.356
And then we have this one,
if you, Madeline,

49
00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:13.070
do you wanna talk about it a bit?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sure.

50
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And tell me where to

51
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.420
concentrate on the screen.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

52
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.690
we had a couple of ideas here.

53
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.230
I think we were most
interested in the top left and

54
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.820
bottom right.

55
00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: This one.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep.

56
00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:35.150
And that's just looking at IMDB score
over the total IMDB vote count.

57
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.490
And then the color association would
be between nominations that movie got

58
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.270
versus how many awards it actually won,
which would be conversions,

59
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.307
that would be wins.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That's really interesting.

60
00:03:51.307 --> 00:03:56.193
I like that idea of looking
at the conversions,

61
00:03:56.193 --> 00:04:01.950
I know we talked about IMDB score and
binging by that.

62
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.750
And then I see, I think, and then you
added an extra layer of information.

63
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.920
So you kinda overlaid multiple quote,
unquote channels on top,

64
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.570
multiple data dimensions on top of it, and
now you can see convergence nominations.

65
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.110
I like what you did down here where I
see you sketched a little bit of what if

66
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.820
it's not stacked on top of each other but
rather side by side.

67
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.820
I like that thought direction you went in.

68
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.170
I do wonder though.

69
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.930
So conversions, so nominations that go
into winning, I feel maybe it's just

70
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.000
because we just talked about the sankey
diagram, but that could be a flow also.

71
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.270
Convergence from
nominations to winning and

72
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.760
I wonder if that's an alternative
that you can look at.

73
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.260
And if there's other ways
of representing this data,

74
00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.850
that would be really interesting too.

75
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.290
And then the other one,
I like, and you did do it.

76
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:02.080
That is the sankey diagram
you drew out at the bottom.

77
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.850
You were trying to-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We were trying to explore

78
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.980
something besides a bar chart, I think.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That's great.

79
00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.420
So what's the Co 1, Co 2 and stuff.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There I thought break it out

80
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.360
by production company and
maybe see by company how well they're

81
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.990
doing at converting nominations to wins.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That's cool.

82
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.760
Yeah.

83
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.424
So this might be a really bad idea or
it might be a really interesting idea.

84
00:05:34.424 --> 00:05:40.224
But one of the things I was debating
about talking about, but didn't

85
00:05:40.224 --> 00:05:46.928
end up talking about is the concept of
visual metaphors when you are designing.

86
00:05:46.928 --> 00:05:51.338
And so, my friend RJ Andrews is really,
really great at this,

87
00:05:51.338 --> 00:05:56.423
infowetrust.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Where he tries

88
00:05:56.423 --> 00:06:02.980
to always relate the,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: The visualization

89
00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:07.250
back to the data itself.

90
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.950
So I think this one is
the one I wanted to show.

91
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.530
Profiling the parks, but it's a video so
maybe we can watch it offline.

92
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:21.370
But he is really amazing at tying the
visuals back into the theme of the data.

93
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.400
And so some of the simplest
things that he's talked

94
00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.350
to me about, and given me feedback on my
visualizations is something as simple as

95
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.300
positive things that grow up, and
negative things that grow down.

96
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:42.320
Or good things that rise up,

97
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.645
and that's something really simple,
that's a visual metaphor.

98
00:06:46.645 --> 00:06:51.681
Things relating movies
back to maybe the shape

99
00:06:51.681 --> 00:07:00.216
of your overall visualization end up
kind of mimicking the movie data itself.

100
00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:05.531
Maybe the shapes are,
looks like film records or like,

101
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:10.180
but as long as it's not
cheesy in a well done way.

102
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:16.698
I think actually there's one that Nadieh
did that I liked because it was so subtle.

103
00:07:16.698 --> 00:07:21.519
And she looked at the,
I think top music that

104
00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:26.601
was played during,
she lives in Amsterdam and

105
00:07:26.601 --> 00:07:31.291
they have a music that
I think in December,

106
00:07:31.291 --> 00:07:38.800
they have radio that kind of just
replays old classic, I think.

107
00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:43.629
And then so this is a visualization
she did of last year's

108
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.260
song selection, and when they were from.

109
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:51.990
And one of the things
that she did was that for

110
00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:01.141
the songs, I believe it was the songs that
were played the most looked like a record.

111
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.542
And then smaller and smaller and smaller.

112
00:08:05.542 --> 00:08:08.570
But it's something as simple as that,
it looks a little bit like it.

113
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.360
So you can see the record in here.

114
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.060
And it's very subtle.

115
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:19.480
But it's like a nice nod to what
the data set is about itself.

116
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.140
And so what I wanted to suggest,
which could be a good idea,

117
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.880
which could be a bad idea,
is that considering the fact that we

118
00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.280
only have these two categories of won or
nominated.

119
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.623
And maybe it's that, and
I'm guessing you mean the nominated

120
00:08:37.623 --> 00:08:43.136
one you only mean that it was
nominated but did not win.

121
00:08:43.136 --> 00:08:49.068
And so slope graphs,
I find them to be very good and

122
00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:55.750
concise.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No slope charts, yeah.

123
00:08:55.750 --> 00:09:01.192
Slope charts are,
I like them a lot because

124
00:09:01.192 --> 00:09:06.340
it's basically kind of relationship.

125
00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:11.480
You can see basically the relationship
between two things and then tell from

126
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:16.660
the angle of it whether it's going,
if the relationship is up or down.

127
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.740
And so maybe there's something that
can be done where instead of a sankey,

128
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.030
one column is the companies, and
the other one is just very simple,

129
00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:32.280
if it goes up because it won,
it goes down because it lost.

130
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:36.880
And maybe there's something you can see
there because of if there's a lot of

131
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.330
them that win or if there's a lot
of them that lose or something.

132
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.350
Not suggesting it as a good idea.

133
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:44.602
Just as an idea [LAUGH].

134
00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:49.870
Because, again, at the end of the day,

135
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:54.360
you have to see the data on the screen
with your visualization to be able to say,

136
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.790
this is good or this is not good.

137
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:59.622
I think that's one of the really
interesting things about designing for

138
00:09:59.622 --> 00:10:00.327
visualization.

139
00:10:00.327 --> 00:10:05.761
I feel like a lot of times when we design
for other things, if we design for

140
00:10:05.761 --> 00:10:10.839
web, like a web page, oftentimes
we can just design in Photoshop or

141
00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:13.177
in Illustrator or something.

142
00:10:13.177 --> 00:10:16.948
And we know exactly how that
page will look like, but

143
00:10:16.948 --> 00:10:20.376
when we design for
visualizations it's very,

144
00:10:20.376 --> 00:10:25.875
very rare that our initial design that
we sketch out turn out to be a good one.

145
00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:31.460
Because it's so dependent on the data and
the shape of the data.

146
00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:34.370
And even if we had done all
of the data exploration,

147
00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.815
maybe sometimes we miss
it by a little bit.

148
00:10:36.815 --> 00:10:41.975
So the design process is
a lot of iteration over and

149
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:45.525
over again, of seeing the data
on the screen in the design and

150
00:10:45.525 --> 00:10:47.855
modifying that, or
going with the different design.

151
00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:52.945
And this one, I like this one.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

152
00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:57.428
this one is a similar idea where
we have nominations over, sorry,

153
00:10:57.428 --> 00:11:00.884
wins over nominations,
which is the shaded area.

154
00:11:00.884 --> 00:11:06.098
But it would be seasonally, so you could
see how many movies were nominated

155
00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:10.608
in January for example versus December.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

156
00:11:10.608 --> 00:11:16.392
then you have this that,
this is super interesting and

157
00:11:16.392 --> 00:11:22.175
I like it very much which is
that it's angle is month but

158
00:11:22.175 --> 00:11:26.338
then as you go out in radius it's year.

159
00:11:26.338 --> 00:11:31.626
And so my concern with this
would be if you have so

160
00:11:31.626 --> 00:11:36.000
many years, it might be harder to see.

161
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.624
It might be harder to be able to compare
the win versus loss, because I'm guessing

162
00:11:42.624 --> 00:11:48.098
it means the orange ones are the wins and
when it's not colored, it's losses.

163
00:11:48.098 --> 00:11:54.684
But if you have so
many years stacked on top of each other,

164
00:11:54.684 --> 00:12:02.521
it might start getting overwhelming
to be able to see those trends.

165
00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:06.301
But what this does really remind me of is,

166
00:12:06.301 --> 00:12:12.781
there was a visualization by Truth and
beauty which is more Stefaner and

167
00:12:12.781 --> 00:12:16.893
some of his associates in Google and
use lab.

168
00:12:16.893 --> 00:12:24.810
And it looked at the search interests for
different keywords for across the years.

169
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:29.259
So it establishes in 2004, yellow is 2004.

170
00:12:29.259 --> 00:12:31.990
And then blue is 2016.

171
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.425
And the x axis, so they actually encode,

172
00:12:36.425 --> 00:12:41.622
they do this where they
encode the data attribute

173
00:12:41.622 --> 00:12:45.820
of date to both the x axis and the color.

174
00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.500
So, because they want to make sure,

175
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:54.859
make doubly sure that l you
pay attention to the date.

176
00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:57.935
And then the y axis is
the search interest.

177
00:12:57.935 --> 00:13:02.596
So how many people were searching for
it at that given time.

178
00:13:02.596 --> 00:13:06.229
And what I want to show you is, I believe.

179
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:13.439
So this is one of the results.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And

180
00:13:13.439 --> 00:13:15.920
they do this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's

181
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:20.210
cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

182
00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.870
this is one of those examples
where they use animation.

183
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.150
To show, actually I think I'm,

184
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:33.570
actally this isn't the right,
yeah I think it's this one maybe.

185
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:42.470
So play, and this is how they use
animation to show you the passing of time.

186
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.520
And so you kind of get.

187
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.410
So, for example, this is aparently,
this search interest for peach on Google.

188
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:55.170
And you can see, again, they kind
of hint to you that both color and

189
00:13:55.170 --> 00:14:00.640
exposition denotes the So yellow, like
in the beginning there wasn't as much,

190
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:06.120
but then like It really builds and
builds outwards like that

191
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:11.350
where there seems to be increased
search interest in recent years.

192
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.900
There's other ones that they have
that's super interesting where I think

193
00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:26.313
it's words that are trends.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: That really,

194
00:14:26.313 --> 00:14:31.989
really spiked up in a certain year and

195
00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:39.050
then came back down I think so-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You think acai that

196
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:44.300
was like a really trendy fruit in like,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I

197
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.530
think they let you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Do a search for that and

198
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.990
then I'm come back.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Find a food, yeah, acai.

199
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.060
No, they don't have it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Maybe it's not a fruit.

200
00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.950
No one knows what it is.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Try again from

201
00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:04.350
Brazil.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Charts that look like

202
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.975
the food okay, that's awesome.

203
00:15:07.975 --> 00:15:11.850
But let me kind of there was one,
wait, wait.

204
00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:16.295
I remember what's that Starbucks drink?

205
00:15:16.295 --> 00:15:22.421
Pumpkin spice latte,
I think they have one that was like,

206
00:15:22.421 --> 00:15:27.423
they have, so in 2006 and 2007 in all of

207
00:15:27.423 --> 00:15:33.174
these it's not that big of a deal,
and then 2011,

208
00:15:33.174 --> 00:15:38.060
and then it just keeps going up and
up and up.

209
00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:45.360
And then there was
an There was another one

210
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:50.460
that peaked at 2013 or 2012 or something,
and it's been coming back down since.

211
00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:55.500
And so I really love this one as
an example of showing how they

212
00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:00.870
encode the data,
not to just, they kind of,

213
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:05.650
that radial format reminded me of this.

214
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:10.055
But they also kind of take
advantage of the fact that seasons,

215
00:16:10.055 --> 00:16:13.019
months are kind of circular and cyclic and

216
00:16:13.019 --> 00:16:17.557
they made this animation out of it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So

217
00:16:17.557 --> 00:16:21.680
maybe this is a direction
that that can go in.

218
00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:27.800
So maybe instead of, maybe it's that, cuz
this is the search interest of 0 to 100,

219
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.510
but maybe your radius could be
the percentage 1 versus lost.

220
00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.600
And that's how you graph that.

221
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:37.370
And that could be a really
interesting option.
