00:00:02.593 --> 00:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So
let's start with data exploration.

2
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.370
So with data exploration,

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.090
what I try to do every single
time that I get a new data set,

4
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.070
whether from a client or for a personal
project, is to first look at the data.

5
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.390
List all of the data attributes that
are either relevant or important.

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.020
Ask questions, make hypotheses
from those data attributes.

7
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.682
And then,
explore the data using some simple charts.

8
00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:39.667
And we'll use an observable notebook for
this, so

9
00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:49.373
you can get the link from the site.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: But,

10
00:00:49.373 --> 00:00:52.021
so to use observable notebook,

11
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:58.112
here's a little bit more direction on
how to use an observable notebook.

12
00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:04.169
So the observable notebook is
something built by Mike Bostock,

13
00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:10.800
who is the creator of D3, as well as
a few other people in his company.

14
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.200
And I think it's really making kind
of developing, especially D3 and

15
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.830
visualizations in the browser, and having
that be kind of in a notebook format with

16
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.370
a lot of kind of process notes and
stuff, very easy.

17
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.101
But to be able to use this,
some of the basics,

18
00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:33.045
there's definitely more
tutorials than this.

19
00:01:33.045 --> 00:01:35.414
There's definitely more
how to's then this, but

20
00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:38.230
I kinda boiled it down to
what we might need today.

21
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.450
So to be able to load any
external libraries you just say

22
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.310
d3 = require('d3'), or
any other modules that you want.

23
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.349
If you want to write text, to write
down notes, you just say markdown, md.

24
00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:00.540
And then put your markdown
text into the backticks.

25
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.067
And to be able to set a global variable
that you can use in any other cell,

26
00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:11.711
just yeah, globalVar is equal to
something, something, something.

27
00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:17.702
To write a block of JavaScript code,
put it into curly braces.

28
00:02:17.702 --> 00:02:21.218
And then to be able to
create an SVG element,

29
00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:26.076
you want to say the svg = DOM.svg,
give it width, height.

30
00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:30.950
And make sure to return
the svg in curly braces.

31
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.808
So that's kind of the basics of
how to use an observable notebook.

32
00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:38.020
And we'll be using it during
our exercises later on.

33
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.685
But before we get into the exercises
of the data exploration,

34
00:02:43.685 --> 00:02:46.634
I want to talk a little
bit about data types.

35
00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:50.925
Because that's really, really important
to talking about basic charts and

36
00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:52.320
what they're good for.
