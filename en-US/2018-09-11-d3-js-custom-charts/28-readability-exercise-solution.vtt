00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.020
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay, so let's try and
do this exercise together.

2
00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.070
Let's add some axis in for the x and
y, let's add some annotations.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.014
In this case, I think I added annotations
for all of the movies who were,

4
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:17.825
I believe, $200 million above the mean.

5
00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:21.623
And let's add some legends for
the genre's.

6
00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:26.611
Okay, let's do this,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

7
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.243
here is the code we've
been working off of.

8
00:00:29.243 --> 00:00:34.233
Okay, now, let's add axis, so

9
00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:39.589
to do axis have xAxis = d3.axis.

10
00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.300
And x-axis are at the bottom,
so we want axisBottom.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.800
Create that, and then we want to pass
in the xScale that we defined up above.

12
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.939
And for a y-axis, let's make that
to the left of our visualization,

13
00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:05.876
so that would be axisLeft and
pass in scale(yScale);.

14
00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:10.738
And then, let's create a group element.

15
00:01:10.738 --> 00:01:14.604
I'm going to give it a class of x-axis.

16
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.660
And then let's create
the axis off of that.

17
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.751
So call(xAxis);, and create another

18
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:33.151
group .classed('y-axis').

19
00:01:34.915 --> 00:01:40.359
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: true, and .call the d3.axis

20
00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:44.162
we created above.

21
00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:48.180
Here I'm wrong, axisLeft, and

22
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.715
then I think that's all we need.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I'm

23
00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:59.180
going to switch over really quickly
to the other tab and look at that.

24
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.400
So we have axis,
just not in the right places.

25
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.790
And so to get them to the right places,

26
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.890
we just need to use SVG transform,
and translate it down.

27
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.913
And then translate the y-axis
across a little bit.

28
00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:17.560
So let's go back and do that.

29
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.922
So where we created the two
SVG group elements,

30
00:02:21.922 --> 00:02:25.531
let's do an attr('transform',.

31
00:02:25.531 --> 00:02:28.942
And in this case we want
to translate the x-axis.

32
00:02:28.942 --> 00:02:34.951
We want to move it down, so
we don't need to translate it by x.

33
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:40.957
But we do want to translate
it in the y direction

34
00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:46.210
down to {height- margin.bottom}.

35
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.910
And for the y-axis,

36
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.190
we want to translate it over, we want
to nudge it to the right a little bit.

37
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.030
So we want to use ('transform',
'translate'(.

38
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.540
And so that's in the x direction, so

39
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.300
we want to nudge it
margin.left in the x direction.

40
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.420
And we don't need to do
anything in the y direction.

41
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.161
And that should be all
the code that it takes

42
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:18.860
to do,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: The axis.

43
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.440
Nope, I was wrong.

44
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.860
So I had nudged the x-axis down all
the way to the bottom of my SVG window.

45
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.430
But, in fact, I actually want
to put it in here in the middle,

46
00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.980
where it's actually
the mean box office figure.

47
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.880
So let me redo that,
let me translate that, actually.

48
00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.840
The x-axis, let me translate
that to yScale, pass in 0,

49
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.970
and then it should be translated
to the correct position.

50
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.690
I'm going to switch over
to double check that.

51
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.865
Yep, yay!

52
00:03:57.865 --> 00:04:02.178
Now I want to do a tiny
bit of adjustments on

53
00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:06.999
the axis to make them
look a little bit better.

54
00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:11.954
And so, for example,
you might notice that the y-axis

55
00:04:11.954 --> 00:04:16.930
is not showing us the most
useful of information.

56
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.520
And so to change that,
all we have to do is say tickFormat.

57
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.439
And what that's going to do is for
every one of the ticks that it shows,

58
00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.290
we can tell it to format
it in a certain way.

59
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.557
And so let's make that to be,

60
00:04:33.557 --> 00:04:38.005
let's divide it by millions.

61
00:04:38.005 --> 00:04:43.131
And also add the mean box
office figure back in.

62
00:04:43.131 --> 00:04:48.213
So that instead of seeing 0 and
then how much above or

63
00:04:48.213 --> 00:04:54.813
how much below, we can see the actual
absolute box office figures.

64
00:04:54.813 --> 00:04:56.801
So let's do that together.

65
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:04.007
And so what that would require is, so
the d that I get here is just a number.

66
00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:08.654
So first of all,
I want to add the meanBox back in.

67
00:05:08.654 --> 00:05:15.175
And I think If I just say,

68
00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:23.569
divide that by 100 million.

69
00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:28.799
And then wrap that around into a parsInt

70
00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:33.084
to clip off any decimal points.

71
00:05:33.084 --> 00:05:40.536
And then I'm just going to say that I want
to prepend a dollar sign in front of it.

72
00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:44.499
And I want to append a M for million.

73
00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:49.214
And hopefully that will give me something
better looking that fits within

74
00:05:49.214 --> 00:05:50.790
the margin.

75
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:55.082
So I'm going to switch over and
double check, and I am wrong.

76
00:05:55.082 --> 00:05:58.150
[LAUGH] I think

77
00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.750
I want to actually be dividing it
by millions instead of 100 million.

78
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.090
So that would make much more sense,
so let me delete two 0s.

79
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.410
Okay, so I'll just say,
this now looks a lot better.

80
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.830
And now we can see
the absolute dollar amount for

81
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.200
each of these box office figures.

82
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.165
And then I'm going to do some more things.

83
00:06:24.165 --> 00:06:29.950
I actually don't quite enjoy
this vertical line right here.

84
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.410
So I'm going to delete that from the SVG.

85
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:40.710
And the fun thing about these d3.axis is
they're just made out of SVG elements.

86
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.800
So it means that if I inspect it,

87
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.960
I can see that that vertical line
is just path with a class domain.

88
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.590
So I can go in and just remove that.

89
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.350
So that mean to you that right now.

90
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:04.049
So in here after I've created the y-axis,
I can just go in there.

91
00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:08.858
This .call will actually return that

92
00:07:08.858 --> 00:07:14.123
selection, that axis group selection.

93
00:07:14.123 --> 00:07:20.766
So let me just select the domain, and
I believe I can just say .remove,

94
00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:26.880
and that should magically,
hopefully, disappear, perfect.

95
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.410
And the last thing I want
to do with the axis is I

96
00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.583
want to just get rid of these particular,

97
00:07:35.583 --> 00:07:40.489
actually, no I think all
of these look good now.

98
00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:44.712
I'm pretty happy with the axis,
hopefully you are too.

99
00:07:44.712 --> 00:07:50.865
And then the other think I want to do
is I want to just put annotations for

100
00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:56.830
every movie that's over 200
million above the mean box office.

101
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.876
We'll skip the legend,
I think the legend is pretty easy

102
00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:05.820
to figure out on your own if you
just look at the documentation.

103
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.716
But let's just get
the annotations in there.

104
00:08:09.716 --> 00:08:13.064
So first let's figure out the annotation

105
00:08:13.064 --> 00:08:16.003
data.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

106
00:08:16.003 --> 00:08:20.101
I said that I wanted to filter it by,

107
00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:28.334
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: If d.boxOffice- the meanBox

108
00:08:28.334 --> 00:08:36.510
office is greater than than $200 million.

109
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:41.507
And there is

110
00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:48.507
actually a few,

111
00:08:50.588 --> 00:08:55.155
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Movies that is indeed over

112
00:08:55.155 --> 00:09:02.220
the $200 million over the meanBox.

113
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:08.682
So I just,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I just console logged

114
00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:15.725
it.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let

115
00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:17.781
me console log in again actually.

116
00:09:17.781 --> 00:09:21.461
And there we go, there are seven movies

117
00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:26.154
that are above the mean by 200 million or
more.

118
00:09:26.154 --> 00:09:30.820
And it's the Dark Knight and Avatar and
like three Star Wars movies.

119
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.114
Okay, now that we have the movies
that we want to annotate,

120
00:09:38.114 --> 00:09:42.521
I want us to quickly take
a look at D3 annotation.

121
00:09:42.521 --> 00:09:49.142
And what it requires
to draw an annotation.

122
00:09:49.142 --> 00:09:53.613
So I'm just going to do the most
basic of annotations, this one.

123
00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:59.007
And to do that one, I just need to pass

124
00:09:59.007 --> 00:10:04.402
in a note and the title for that note,

125
00:10:04.402 --> 00:10:09.449
I need to give it an x/y position,

126
00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:14.346
so the x/y position to point to.

127
00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:22.177
And an offset x/y position to put
that annotation on, so let's do that.

128
00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:29.423
And so for each of them, what we need is
a note with a title, x/y positions and

129
00:10:29.423 --> 00:10:35.570
an offset x/y position to draw
kind of the the little pointer at.

130
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:42.085
And so I'm going to map through
all of the movies that are left.

131
00:10:42.085 --> 00:10:46.036
And I'm going to return
an object with a note.

132
00:10:46.036 --> 00:10:52.690
And I'm going to say that the title of
the note is the title of the movie.

133
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:56.980
The x position is the xScale of the date.

134
00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:05.760
The y position is yScale of
the boxOffice- meanBox office.

135
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:12.572
And I just want the offset to be
maybe 20 pixels in the x direction.

136
00:11:12.572 --> 00:11:21.360
And then no offset in the y direction.

137
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.981
And if I did that right,
hopefully I did that right.

138
00:11:28.435 --> 00:11:30.264
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This is the data I have,

139
00:11:30.264 --> 00:11:36.520
and I think all I have to do is create
a D3 annotation passing that data.

140
00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:41.320
And then I think it will just magically
draw those annotations for me.

141
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.146
So let's give that a try,
makeAnnotations =, I need to create an,

142
00:11:48.146 --> 00:11:53.223
so up above I've defined
annotation as a package.

143
00:11:53.223 --> 00:11:56.140
So, it's a D3 SVG annotation.

144
00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.480
I'm going to call this function.

145
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.760
I'm going to tell it that the type
of annotation that I want is

146
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.530
an annotation label.

147
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:10.300
And then, I think with just
this I can pass in the data.

148
00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:17.115
And much like with D3.axis,

149
00:12:17.115 --> 00:12:23.390
I can just create a SVG group element and

150
00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:28.728
then call(makeAnnotation).

151
00:12:28.728 --> 00:12:32.791
And if I did this correctly,
and make annotations.

152
00:12:32.791 --> 00:12:38.690
And if I did this correctly,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Check your path there.

153
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.167
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Sorry what?

154
00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:40.897
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: On 143,

155
00:12:40.897 --> 00:12:43.818
I think you need a d.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Thank you so much.

156
00:12:43.818 --> 00:12:48.370
And if I did this correctly,

157
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:54.481
it would show them, no.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

158
00:12:54.481 --> 00:12:57.160
something else I need, .annotation.

159
00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.200
So I need to pass in annotations, so

160
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.690
I need to say, so
this doesn't return a function.

161
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.580
So .annotations, and

162
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.290
then hopefully show us,
there we go Look at that.

163
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:15.250
It draws annotations.

164
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:20.730
I just need to give it some, obviously
the placement is a little bit off.

165
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:25.850
I just need to tell it to be placed
at the end of the pointer, and

166
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:31.230
I think to do that we just
open up options, and I think.

167
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:32.620
It's, is it this one?

168
00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:36.630
Okay, let's go with this one.

169
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:43.410
And for that one it says I want
to align to the middle and

170
00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:47.350
put the orientation top/bottom.

171
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:48.560
Let's give that a try.

172
00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.270
So that's a setting I pass into note and
so

173
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:57.490
I want a line in the middle and
the orientation I want to be top bottom.

174
00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.380
Let's see what happens with that.

175
00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:06.100
Nope, I think maybe it's that
the orientation is left to right.

176
00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.903
Let's try that
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Align middle

177
00:14:11.903 --> 00:14:17.991
orientation is
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: there we go,

178
00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:19.230
I finally figured it out.

179
00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.540
Left right, isn't that what I
wrote just now, left right?

180
00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:28.079
Align so title and align is middle and
orientation is left right.

181
00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.800
Maybe I just need to.

182
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.940
There we go.

183
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:39.728
There we go and so
just a few lines of settings and

184
00:14:39.728 --> 00:14:44.480
a few lines of Creating a group and

185
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.743
calling it and we have annotations,

186
00:14:49.743 --> 00:14:58.080
and D3 annotatioms makes that super,
super easy.

187
00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:03.020
And now we have breathability, we can
see which years, we can see how much

188
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:08.220
box office figures are,
we can see some of the highest peaks.

189
00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:14.550
If we had more time I would want
us to label that This side,

190
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:19.660
that this line in the middle
are the mean box office figures.

191
00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:23.250
And I want us to label the genres.

192
00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:28.160
But I think these are things that
we can figure out by ourselves.

193
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:31.961
So I want to move onto the next section.
