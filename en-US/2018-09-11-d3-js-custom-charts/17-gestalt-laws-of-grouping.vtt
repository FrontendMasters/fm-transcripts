00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.923
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And once we've talked about
marks and channels, another thing that I

2
00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:10.361
want to talk a little bit about is this
thing called Gestalt Laws of Grouping.

3
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:13.912
So apparently Gestalt is German for
patterns.

4
00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:18.292
So I think something that came out,
I think, in either the 60s or

5
00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:20.025
maybe earlier than that.

6
00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:25.411
That's kind of looking into
the psychology of how the human

7
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:31.349
mind just naturally groups
individual elements into patterns.

8
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.613
And there is,
one of the books that'll I'll recommend

9
00:00:36.613 --> 00:00:41.432
later called The Functional Art
by Alberto Cairo.

10
00:00:41.432 --> 00:00:46.112
He has a really great section
talking about how to use these

11
00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.750
Gestalt Laws to our advantage.

12
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.965
And in particular,

13
00:00:49.965 --> 00:00:54.834
how to use them in data visualization to
help your readers save processing time.

14
00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.676
Because these are the things that
our brains already naturally do.

15
00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:05.170
So utilizing them in the right context to
help them read our visualizations easier.

16
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.720
And so there's, I think, six of them.

17
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.980
But I think we'll only talk about
three of them today that I think

18
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.130
are the most relevant to us
as we design visualizations.

19
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.020
And so the first of them are proximity.

20
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.060
And so proximity,
that's pretty straightforward.

21
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.640
Proximity is that we tend to

22
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.130
see things that are near to each
other as being in the same group.

23
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.171
And so Alberto's recommendation
is just to put related

24
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:44.970
objects near to each other.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: To

25
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.820
kind of emphasize that natural grouping.

26
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.330
The second one is similarity.

27
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.440
So the same looking objects

28
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.590
will appear like they are in a group or
we'll process them as being in a group.

29
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.260
And so you can use this to
indicate similar things.

30
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.730
And this is especially helpful
if those things can't be

31
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.090
placed close to each other.

32
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.350
Like, perhaps you've already used
the proximity thing to highlight some

33
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.790
other sort of natural grouping, that maybe
are a little more high in importance.

34
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.870
But then you'll also want to indicate
this other sort of natural grouping, and

35
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.310
maybe you will put that similarly.

36
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.100
For example, these kind of bar
charts are a great example.

37
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.660
So it seems like there's already
one sort of natural grouping here.

38
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.586
Maybe these are, I don't know, years or
something that's naturally grouped by it.

39
00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:49.174
And then the colors though,
you know that those colors,

40
00:02:49.174 --> 00:02:55.090
the bars with the same colors probably
belong to the same category of something.

41
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.842
So, really,

42
00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:59.795
the similarity is really helpful in
conjuntion with proximity to indicate

43
00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:02.622
these two different kinds of groups.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

44
00:03:02.622 --> 00:03:07.714
the other example here is
if you have geography.

45
00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:12.199
If you have a map, then proximity
is not something that you can use,

46
00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:16.310
because you know,
maps have position already encoded in it.

47
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.369
So maybe using colors or textures or some
other way to indicate the same thing is

48
00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:26.533
a great way to indicate groupings
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

49
00:03:26.533 --> 00:03:31.959
the last one I wanna say,
is this thing called enclosure,

50
00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.278
which just means that
our brains will tend to,

51
00:03:36.278 --> 00:03:41.850
if you box a certain part, or
if you just give some shading.

52
00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.680
We'll think of that as somehow
related to each other.

53
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.840
Our brains would just go naturally
towards those sections and

54
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.440
think they're related to each other.

55
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.470
So this is kind of helpful for
creating visualizations that have

56
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.280
maybe multiple sections that
should be paid attention to.

57
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.450
So these are the Gestalt Laws of Grouping.

58
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.910
I like to think of them as if marks and

59
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.700
channels are kind of the primary way
to describe our data, then maybe these

60
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.070
Gestalt Laws of Grouping can help us
give the context around that data.

61
00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.610
Kind of give it that secondary
layer of information that

62
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.293
maybe can't be mapped to individual marks.

63
00:04:22.293 --> 00:04:27.257
Maybe they aren't to describe
individual data points, but

64
00:04:27.257 --> 00:04:33.987
rather to describe groups of those data
points together, those marks together.

65
00:04:33.987 --> 00:04:39.050
So that's the way that I like to
think about these to kind of give.

66
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.558
I think they are really great for
helping give context.
