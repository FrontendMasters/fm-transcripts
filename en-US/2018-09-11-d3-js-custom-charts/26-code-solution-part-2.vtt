00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.210
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: But
spikes aren't as much my thing.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.588
So [LAUGH] I like things
a little bit smoother.

3
00:00:08.588 --> 00:00:12.160
So what I wanna show you
right now is a D3 area.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.850
In fact, a lot of these shapes have this
thing called curves where you can specify.

5
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.379
So each of these are the points and
then we'll draw the line between them, but

6
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:26.198
how much of a curve do you want?

7
00:00:26.198 --> 00:00:31.850
And I think the one that I
tend to like is this one.

8
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.566
I'll be honest, I don't really know
what each of these curves mean.

9
00:00:35.566 --> 00:00:40.159
They have very interesting names that I
think are probably really meaningful, but

10
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.797
I don't really know why
they're meaningful.

11
00:00:42.797 --> 00:00:45.748
But I'm going to use curved catmull ROM,

12
00:00:45.748 --> 00:00:49.550
cuz I find that they make nice curves for
me.

13
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.184
And so go back to that area
generator where we specify the x,

14
00:00:54.184 --> 00:00:57.164
y1, y0 and then pass in this curve.

15
00:00:57.164 --> 00:01:02.267
D3.curveCatmullRom and
then you'll see that

16
00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:08.370
it makes really nice non-spiky curves,
and that's it.

17
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.761
That's all it took to draw the curves and
you'll notice we're missing one last

18
00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:23.396
thing, which is the right colors.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So that would be the fill.

19
00:01:23.396 --> 00:01:26.489
And for each of them, we're going
to view using the color scale and

20
00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:27.546
passing in the genre.

21
00:01:27.546 --> 00:01:30.725
And then you might have guessed
by now that if you do that,

22
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:33.640
there's going to be a lot of overlap and
you might not

23
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.638
be able to tell the difference between
some of the movies that overlap.

24
00:01:37.638 --> 00:01:43.258
So for now,
I'm just gonna give it a white stroke,

25
00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:49.150
so that we can tell them apart and
there we go.

26
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.549
We got the curves and
is it fair to say that it was actually

27
00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.674
pretty easy to get the curves for
each of the months?

28
00:01:57.674 --> 00:01:58.516
I'm glad.

29
00:01:58.516 --> 00:02:02.664
And so this is another example
of the area generator wasn't,

30
00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:05.936
the examples that
the documentation give you for

31
00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:09.789
the area generator definitely
doesn't look like this.

32
00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.371
And it took a little bit more munging
of the data, like it took a little

33
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:21.553
bit of massaging of the data to create
a little bit of fake data to get to this.

34
00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:23.237
But I want to show you,

35
00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:29.295
this is another way that you can kinda
take what's given and be creative with it.

36
00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:33.834
So yeah, so this is the curves.

37
00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:36.942
The one for the each movie.
