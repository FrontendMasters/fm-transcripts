00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.882
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I want to give some
more non D3 SVG functionality.

2
00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:08.941
And I want to give these as options for

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:13.790
giving either more context or
for improving aesthetics.

4
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.189
And so, some of these are, one of
the things I'm a fan of is patterns and

5
00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.050
textures that I showed earlier.

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.423
And so there's this great
library called textuers.js

7
00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:35.690
that makes kind of creating
SVG textures really easy.

8
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.350
This is the part where I'm going to
show a bunch of things from Nadieh,

9
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.200
whose website is at Visual Cinnamon.

10
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.597
Because I think she is
the queen of making beautiful

11
00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:53.874
things with SVG filters and gradients.

12
00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:57.022
And just basically using SVG technology,

13
00:00:57.022 --> 00:01:03.520
web technology to make her visualizations
a lot more aesthetically pleasing.

14
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.410
So with SVG you can also do gradients.

15
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:11.680
And one of my favorite ways I've
seen someone use their gradients is,

16
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.415
I think this is a kind of a modified
version of a chord diagram we saw earlier.

17
00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:22.149
As you see in chord diagrams,
there's a source and a target, and

18
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.948
usually you might color
code the source and target.

19
00:01:25.948 --> 00:01:31.140
And so what she's done here is start
out from one color as a source,

20
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.035
and then as the chord is
going towards its target,

21
00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:38.773
make the gradient blend
into the target color.

22
00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:43.176
And I think that's a really
beautiful use of gradients.

23
00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:48.241
Text along a path, it's one of
those things where it looks like

24
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:54.087
it'd be really hard to draw text along
a curve, or something like that.

25
00:01:54.087 --> 00:01:59.434
But SVG actually makes that really,
really easy.

26
00:01:59.434 --> 00:02:04.904
So this is another example from Nadieh,
where she places kind

27
00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:10.279
of these text around this,
I guess it would be a donut chart.

28
00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:15.389
And it just looks so
much better than if she had just,

29
00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.920
had just like text that was just straight,
and

30
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.634
like kinda comes off the donut
chart in like weird angles.

31
00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:30.016
And they just makes it so
much more aesthethicly pleasing.

32
00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:36.660
So SVG filters, I'm doing like,
using a combination of blurs and

33
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.826
I think, offsets, and color matrices.

34
00:02:40.826 --> 00:02:45.476
And there's, a lot of these
different SVG filters are available.

35
00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:51.586
And the ones that I think I see the most
examples of are these drop shadow effects.

36
00:02:51.586 --> 00:02:59.510
And then this is again Nadieh where
she shows the different layers.

37
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.360
So she also has the center aligned and

38
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.040
she wants to show how much a data point
is above or below that center line.

39
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.040
And the way that she does it is creating
these kind of drop shadow effects, so

40
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.470
that it looks like these layers
are stacked on top of each other.

41
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.491
And then clipping and masking,
which is kind of having kind of SVG,

42
00:03:25.491 --> 00:03:30.159
so being able to like draw
something on SVG, and

43
00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:35.060
then clip that by another path or
something.

44
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.997
And if you have the time,

45
00:03:36.997 --> 00:03:42.910
I would highly recommend you read
the making of behind this visualization.

46
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.799
Because Nadieh uses both the SVG
filters and clipping, and

47
00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.140
masking to achieve these effects.

48
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.090
And so this is called baby spikes.

49
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.785
This project is called baby spikes, and

50
00:03:57.785 --> 00:04:03.012
she has in her blog,
kind of the making of the baby spike.

51
00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:07.410
And she talks about kind of her process,
exploring in R.

52
00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:14.300
And then she also talks about kind
of how she did those drop shadow.

53
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.360
And so, for these effects,

54
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.130
she actually made this ring
with the drop shadow effect.

55
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.790
And what she did is actually
she clipped this by

56
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:32.760
the shape of these spikes.

57
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.560
So, that's another, I think she
is absolutely amazing at kind of

58
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.250
looking at what technologies that
are available and thinking through them.

59
00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.089
And kind of coming out with a way to do,
a way to make them her own.

60
00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:57.317
And kind of like using them together
to help make her visualizations more

61
00:04:57.317 --> 00:05:02.210
effective, more communicative,
more aesthetically pleasing.

62
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.820
So, she is like a constant
source of inspiration for

63
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.140
me, I wanna get to her level.

64
00:05:09.334 --> 00:05:14.730
Yeah, these are some of the SVG filters
and stuff that I wanted to share with you.
