WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.875 --> 00:00:04.515
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So this is awesome, cuz I
heard a lot of conversation about the data

2
00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:08.221
and I'm really, really excited to
hear what you've come up with.

3
00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.350
So I want to go through
some of these together.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.843
And I hope you'll either read it off or
tell me what the data type is and

5
00:00:14.843 --> 00:00:18.888
tell me if you think it's important or
relevant for later on.

6
00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:25.243
And then what I want to do is based
on the data attributes we list,

7
00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:30.080
I want to go through them and
ask some questions.

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.570
So kind of think through that as
we're doing the data attributes also.

9
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.047
So let's get started.

10
00:00:39.047 --> 00:00:41.131
I'm going to be doing it
with the markdown file.

11
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.043
But usually when I'm just doing myself,

12
00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:47.964
I'll put it on a piece of paper or
I'll put it on my iPad.

13
00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:51.380
But whatever works for
you in your process.

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.550
So let's see.

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.160
So you're going to have to help me.

16
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.790
Because apparently,
I can't see the attributes and

17
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.183
write the text at the same time.

18
00:01:01.183 --> 00:01:05.703
So you're going [LAUGH] to have
to help me read them out, but

19
00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:09.210
I do remember that
the first thing is title.

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300
Although, I don't think I'm
going to put them on there,

21
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.980
cuz I don't think we can do much
interesting things with them.

22
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.980
Although I heard somebody say,
sentiment analysis and

23
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.590
that might be really interesting.

24
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.350
Yeah, so that could be really interesting.

25
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.977
So just in case,
I'm gonna put that on there.

26
00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:30.708
And when I beta tested this class,
there was debate as to what type of data

27
00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:34.451
attribute Title could be and
we did not have a consensus.

28
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:37.425
[LAUGH] Because we're like is
it categorical, but it's unique?

29
00:01:37.425 --> 00:01:39.113
Is it a unique ID?

30
00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:41.304
So yeah, we don't have a consensus.

31
00:01:41.304 --> 00:01:45.734
But for now,
I'm going to just not give it a data type.

32
00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:51.926
[LAUGH] But I think that'd be a really
cool idea to do sentiment analysis.

33
00:01:51.926 --> 00:01:54.769
So please help me what the next-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Year.

34
00:01:54.769 --> 00:01:55.707
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Thank you.

35
00:01:55.707 --> 00:02:00.177
Year, so that would be data type-wise?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Temporal.

36
00:02:00.177 --> 00:02:02.912
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Thank you.

37
00:02:02.912 --> 00:02:07.335
And then let's list them all out, and
then we can go back later on to highlight

38
00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:10.620
the ones that we think might
be really important, okay.

39
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.356
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Released.

40
00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:15.577
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Released, and that is

41
00:02:15.577 --> 00:02:20.864
temporal also, cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Run-time.

42
00:02:20.864 --> 00:02:21.366
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Thank you.

43
00:02:21.366 --> 00:02:27.390
[LAUGH] Thank you, Run-time and
what you'd think that would be?

44
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.931
Run-time is the length of the movie,
right?

45
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:34.876
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It should be temporal or

46
00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:37.523
range value.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So-

47
00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:38.545
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Quantitative?

48
00:02:38.545 --> 00:02:39.755
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, I think I will lean

49
00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:41.203
more towards quantitative.

50
00:02:41.203 --> 00:02:45.552
Cuz when I think temporal, I think dates.

51
00:02:45.552 --> 00:02:48.337
So whatever I would put into
JavaScript date objects, so

52
00:02:48.337 --> 00:02:51.500
that's the way that I would
think about temporal.

53
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.616
The reason why we want
to do the data types.

54
00:02:54.616 --> 00:03:01.855
So not the programming language types,
but rather data types to ask questions,

55
00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:06.017
specifically about data and
exploring data.

56
00:03:06.017 --> 00:03:08.243
And so that's a reason.

57
00:03:08.243 --> 00:03:11.800
Okay, so let's get back into this.

58
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.468
Run-time, we just talked about Run-time,
which is quantitative.

59
00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:19.330
And then the next thing
on the list is Genre.

60
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.283
And I think there's probably
consensus about what this is, right?

61
00:03:26.283 --> 00:03:28.356
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Categorical.

62
00:03:28.356 --> 00:03:32.304
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Categorical, thank you.

63
00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:36.100
Director, where did you put this one?

64
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.854
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Categorical.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

65
00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:42.397
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I guess.

66
00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:44.529
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I think I actually would

67
00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:46.774
really agree with that.

68
00:03:46.774 --> 00:03:48.479
Yeah, so I think I'd say, categorical.

69
00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.045
Because, like Genre,

70
00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:54.207
you can imagine potentially being
able to group by directors.

71
00:03:54.207 --> 00:04:00.110
So you could be like, these are the movies
that these directors have directed.

72
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.280
[LAUGH] So
that's why director could potentially

73
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.953
be a categorical type of attribute.

74
00:04:10.953 --> 00:04:14.594
And then we have, actually, let's put
the next few into the same bucket.

75
00:04:14.594 --> 00:04:17.856
So there's director, writer, actors.

76
00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:23.150
I would argue that all
of them of categorical,

77
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.052
because you can bucket movies with these.

78
00:04:28.052 --> 00:04:31.841
And then I'm going to ignore plot.

79
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.829
I guess, again, you can do something
like the title sentiment analysis,

80
00:04:34.829 --> 00:04:36.530
which is really interesting.

81
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.307
But let me also make a brief note
about potentially missing data or

82
00:04:42.307 --> 00:04:44.627
the validity of the data.

83
00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:48.853
So for example, I think,
if I remember correctly,

84
00:04:48.853 --> 00:04:51.925
some of these plots might not be full,

85
00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:57.510
as in maybe some of them are cutoff
if the plot is a little bit shorter.

86
00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:02.539
So when you're going through your data,

87
00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.710
just get a sense if
some of the attributes,

88
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.307
is it missing something or does it give

89
00:05:12.307 --> 00:05:17.060
all of the context that you need, etc?

90
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.185
So I'm going to skip plot.

91
00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:24.248
There's also language, which I'm guessing,

92
00:05:24.248 --> 00:05:28.329
consensus was categorical or did you?

93
00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:31.575
Categorical.

94
00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:36.513
I'm going to ignore country,
because this is all filtered by USA.

95
00:05:36.513 --> 00:05:39.557
Awards, what do you think about that one?

96
00:05:45.573 --> 00:05:47.047
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could be quantitative,

97
00:05:47.047 --> 00:05:50.060
if you're looking at just wins or
nominations.

98
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.595
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, yeah.

99
00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:55.865
So quantitative,
I think that's a really good one.

100
00:05:55.865 --> 00:05:59.801
I think this is one of those that you
could probably do a little bit of

101
00:05:59.801 --> 00:06:03.950
processing and break it down into
a further, like maybe you can create

102
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.760
categories for yourself that's like,
this one has information about Oscars.

103
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.862
So maybe for the awards, you just pulled
out just the numbers for Oscars and

104
00:06:12.862 --> 00:06:14.503
that would be quantitative.

105
00:06:14.503 --> 00:06:16.970
Or they have things about wins and
nominations.

106
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.420
So maybe you pull out Oscars,
wins, nominations.

107
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.330
And those can be attributes
that are quantitative.

108
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.592
So I think that's really good.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

109
00:06:27.592 --> 00:06:31.143
then I'm skipping the poster.

110
00:06:31.143 --> 00:06:34.210
And then we have some ratings.

111
00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:41.027
So we have metascore, which we talked
about earlier as quantitative.

112
00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:46.657
And then we have IMDb ratings,
which we also mentioned before.

113
00:06:46.657 --> 00:06:47.752
That's quantitative.

114
00:06:47.752 --> 00:06:55.242
And IMDb votes, similarly,
that should be quantitative.

115
00:06:55.242 --> 00:06:59.165
And type of movie.

116
00:06:59.165 --> 00:07:01.154
I think they are all type of movies.

117
00:07:01.154 --> 00:07:04.834
And then the next one is interesting,
DVDs.

118
00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:09.122
So DVD release, and
that would be temporal.

119
00:07:09.122 --> 00:07:09.695
Thank you.

120
00:07:09.695 --> 00:07:11.217
Yeah, so that would be temporal.

121
00:07:11.217 --> 00:07:15.257
And I think something
interesting could be looking at

122
00:07:15.257 --> 00:07:19.488
the time between the movie release and
the DVD release.

123
00:07:19.488 --> 00:07:21.747
Is there anything interesting there?

124
00:07:21.747 --> 00:07:26.511
And so the reason why I like listing out
data attributes as a very first step is

125
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:31.348
not only do you start to get to know
the data and what's there, you kinda start

126
00:07:31.348 --> 00:07:37.252
being like, there's potential for this, or
this data attribute could help me do this.

127
00:07:37.252 --> 00:07:42.760
And it starts kinda triggering all
these potential possibilities.

128
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:46.082
And so the next one is BoxOffice.

129
00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:49.143
And this is actually
a really great example.

130
00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:54.687
So I am looking at, I think, yes,
so this is a really great example

131
00:07:54.687 --> 00:07:59.938
again of missing data or
figuring out the validity of the data.

132
00:07:59.938 --> 00:08:06.162
So this particular movie doesn't
have the box office figure.

133
00:08:06.162 --> 00:08:10.785
But later on, if you look,
I think because this is 1999 and

134
00:08:10.785 --> 00:08:16.648
it's one of the earlier movies, I wasn't
able to pull the box office figures.

135
00:08:16.648 --> 00:08:21.809
But there's definitely some others,
I think, that do have them.

136
00:08:21.809 --> 00:08:27.214
So then this is a design question later
on, I think, of, if we do end up using

137
00:08:27.214 --> 00:08:32.873
box office, how do we accommodate for
the fact that a lot of the earlier movies,

138
00:08:32.873 --> 00:08:36.950
maybe ten or so
of them don't have the box office figure?

139
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:42.351
Do we go and manually put it in
ourselves from other data sources?

140
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:44.154
Or do we just ignore those years?

141
00:08:44.154 --> 00:08:48.223
So these are some design questions for
later,

142
00:08:48.223 --> 00:08:52.721
depending on what we decide
to do with the designs.

143
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:59.158
So BoxOffice, this one,
did we say quantitative?

144
00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:04.959
Yeah, cool.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then Production.

145
00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:10.380
So Production, I think this one
is movie studios, it seems like.

146
00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.405
So this is potentially interesting too.

147
00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:15.120
So this data site is the top blockbusters.

148
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:21.655
So which big movie studios are kind of
coming out with these blockbusters.

149
00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:25.509
And so how would you categorize?

150
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:29.142
Yes, that would be [LAUGH] categorical.

151
00:09:29.142 --> 00:09:35.643
[LAUGH] And then I think those
are probably the most irrelevant ones.

152
00:09:35.643 --> 00:09:37.723
So this is the list.

153
00:09:37.723 --> 00:09:41.796
And then do you want to shout out
which ones you find interesting and

154
00:09:41.796 --> 00:09:46.796
from this list?
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I see Madeleine going for

155
00:09:46.796 --> 00:09:50.579
it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We talked about seeing when

156
00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:55.296
the different ratings map with
each other versus deviate,

157
00:09:55.296 --> 00:09:58.879
like comparing IMDb
rating with Metascore or

158
00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:02.916
the other rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

159
00:10:02.916 --> 00:10:07.924
Cuz if you open that ratings thing up,
there's also Rotten Tomatoes.

160
00:10:07.924 --> 00:10:13.256
So actually let me, cuz I think there's,
let's say, Metascore.

161
00:10:13.256 --> 00:10:17.825
I'm just gonna turn this into Metacritic
then, or Metascore and Metacritic,

162
00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:18.990
I think is the same.

163
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.572
But let's add the Rotten Tomatoes
score in there.

164
00:10:26.319 --> 00:10:27.783
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So you're saying,

165
00:10:27.783 --> 00:10:36.021
comparing these three.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

166
00:10:36.021 --> 00:10:42.289
any others that anyone thinks
is important to look at or

167
00:10:42.289 --> 00:10:47.248
interesting to look at, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: As we've

168
00:10:47.248 --> 00:10:50.916
defined the kind of loose
type system in parenthesis,

169
00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:56.510
something that's interesting to me would
be composing some of those categories.

170
00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:01.306
And seeing what the relationships,
the individual sets are a different

171
00:11:01.306 --> 00:11:04.773
composition strategies,
joins, associations.

172
00:11:04.773 --> 00:11:08.685
And basically using that
as input dimension for

173
00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:14.275
something like more quantitative values,
like ratings, votes.

174
00:11:14.275 --> 00:11:19.916
So you would end up taking a crack at
exposing, like if you put a writer and

175
00:11:19.916 --> 00:11:24.835
an actor and a director together,
what would be your revenue?

176
00:11:24.835 --> 00:11:28.794
And that would start with a compositional
step on the categories that we've defined.

177
00:11:28.794 --> 00:11:33.168
And your second step would be to compare
the result of that composition to one of

178
00:11:33.168 --> 00:11:34.704
the quantitative values.

179
00:11:34.704 --> 00:11:40.900
And I think the dataset, it leaves us a
good room to explore in those directions.

180
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.130
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, so basically,

181
00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:48.220
taking something like the director,
writers, actors combining them and

182
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:51.110
comparing them to something
like the box office figures.

183
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:56.966
So what you were saying, basically
the question is, which directors,

184
00:11:56.966 --> 00:12:01.866
actors together,
writers together give the most revenue?

185
00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:05.653
So the box office figure,
tha'd be really interesting also.

186
00:12:05.653 --> 00:12:12.155
Yeah, so I think that also-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Votes could be a proxy for

187
00:12:12.155 --> 00:12:15.136
how popular something is.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Mm, mm-hm.

188
00:12:15.136 --> 00:12:18.278
So I am IMDb votes, that's a good one.

189
00:12:18.278 --> 00:12:23.290
Actually, I think a lot of these could
be potentially really interesting,

190
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.891
like the-Run time versus DVD,
I mentioned, sorry,

191
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:29.809
Release versus DVD, I mentioned earlier.

192
00:12:29.809 --> 00:12:31.729
There's a lot of possibility here.

193
00:12:31.729 --> 00:12:36.950
So kind of based off what we just, yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We

194
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:42.074
were thinking of something
else where it's not there,

195
00:12:42.074 --> 00:12:49.705
but just have a competed popularity based
on various things we pull out of the data,

196
00:12:49.705 --> 00:12:54.252
and it'd be are own function defined,

197
00:12:54.252 --> 00:12:58.920
whether it'd be relevant or
not, who cares?

198
00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.886
Probably popularity function of some sort.
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I think, yes.

199
00:13:03.886 --> 00:13:09.529
I think definitely,
while we're in the data exploration phase,

200
00:13:09.529 --> 00:13:13.573
I think any idea is interesting,
give it a try.

201
00:13:13.573 --> 00:13:15.014
And if it sticks, that's great.

202
00:13:15.014 --> 00:13:18.610
If it doesn't, no harm there.

203
00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:24.526
But the only thing I think I would say is
if you decide to make something yourself,

204
00:13:24.526 --> 00:13:28.971
don't be afraid to go pull
additional data from elsewhere.

205
00:13:28.971 --> 00:13:34.252
Let's say if you get this dataset and you
have other things that you're interested

206
00:13:34.252 --> 00:13:39.923
in, like that popularity, don't be afraid
to pull that from other different sources.

207
00:13:39.923 --> 00:13:43.922
I find that the Internet
is a magical place.

208
00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:45.027
And a lot of times,

209
00:13:45.027 --> 00:13:49.130
you can find a lot of things if you
just have the right search term.

210
00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:52.160
Except for
I guess sensitive government data,

211
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.040
I think is probably the one
thing that's harder to find.

212
00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:02.480
But after doing that, I think the only
thing I would say is if you do end up

213
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:07.216
making something that's unique to
yourself, to have a section in the final

214
00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:11.878
visualization at the very bottom that
kind of talks about how you did that.

215
00:14:11.878 --> 00:14:15.972
Talks about your data sources and
talks about the calculations,

216
00:14:15.972 --> 00:14:18.139
the way you did the calculations.

217
00:14:18.139 --> 00:14:20.300
That would be the only thing I would say.
