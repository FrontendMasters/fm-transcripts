00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.294
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Let's talk about
based on some of these things.

2
00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:07.409
I think we already have some
things we're interested in, so

3
00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:10.729
let's kind of together
list out the questions.

4
00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:16.233
And let's just throw out some questions
and then maybe after we throw them

5
00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:21.486
out we can like prioritize them in
terms of which one to explore first.

6
00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:27.881
And so let's write down some of the ones
that have already been talked about.

7
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:34.153
And so I think one of them was comparing

8
00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:39.445
between like Metacritic versus

9
00:00:39.445 --> 00:00:46.570
Rotton Tomatoes versus IMDB ratings.

10
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:54.604
I think what another one was
the combination of directors,

11
00:00:54.604 --> 00:00:59.870
writers, and
actors versus the box office figures.

12
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.648
And then I think we talked
a little bit about the difference

13
00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:11.715
between like,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: DVD, so

14
00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:17.283
the release date, some movie release date,

15
00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:24.730
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Versus DVD release date.

16
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.120
What were some of the other ones
that you were talking about or

17
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.770
that have stuck out, ones we were
talking about, the attributes?

18
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.490
Sorry, I just realized that we
were doing a lot of versus.

19
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.140
So I also want to encourage
just question formats.

20
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.518
So instead of just versus,
kind of if that was the case,

21
00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:55.287
how can we turn that into a data question?

22
00:01:55.287 --> 00:01:59.791
So, instead of saying versus,
is that like-

23
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:01.423
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does it correlate,

24
00:02:01.423 --> 00:02:05.743
do you have,
if you see certain number type of words,

25
00:02:05.743 --> 00:02:09.495
does that correlate with
a higher metascore?

26
00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:12.663
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Even just look at wins

27
00:02:12.663 --> 00:02:13.629
alone, right?

28
00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.039
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, or-
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]

29
00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:18.468
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do the number of wins

30
00:02:18.468 --> 00:02:23.102
correlate with even just
Rotten Tomatoes or something, right?

31
00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:23.973
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, absolutely.

32
00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:24.920
Okay.

33
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I like that as a simple,
that's a really good one.

34
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.130
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So basically,
is there any relationship between

35
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.370
the number of wins and

36
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.840
how popular or
well rated it is by the general public?

37
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.694
Something along those lines.

38
00:02:46.694 --> 00:02:53.777
I kind of think for those first few I
was doing them to be more shorthand.

39
00:02:53.777 --> 00:03:01.018
But in general, I would kind of
encourage putting your questions as a,

40
00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:07.189
if this exploration turned out well,
is this a hypothesis?

41
00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.149
Can this be like the title of your
visualization kind of the the theme to

42
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.600
build the visualization around?

43
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.873
So I think yeah then if
that turns out well then

44
00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:23.823
there's a relationship
between Academy Awards and

45
00:03:23.823 --> 00:03:29.220
the popularity of a movie or
something like that.

46
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.999
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How about the relationship
between popularity to genre over time?

47
00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.506
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay.

48
00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:41.423
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you could see people
are preferring comedies these days

49
00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:43.440
versus horror movies.

50
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.949
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Do people prefer-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Times of the year and.

51
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.217
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah,
let's go in that direction.

52
00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:53.222
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or it could be by month,
or it could be just by year.

53
00:03:53.222 --> 00:03:56.010
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah, wait, let's-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You could say like over time

54
00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.565
people are preferring these.

55
00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:01.625
Or there's a slew of really great
horror movies that were really

56
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:03.362
just between these dates.

57
00:04:03.362 --> 00:04:03.989
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah.

58
00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.905
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really great comedy
movies released between these dates.

59
00:04:06.905 --> 00:04:09.799
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes,
I love this thought process.

60
00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.836
So basically kind of you
have these hypotheses, and

61
00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:15.666
that, I call them questions or
hypothesis, but

62
00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:19.267
you have these hypotheses that
you want to test with the data.

63
00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:24.107
And so I think there was really
a few different great ones in there.

64
00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:31.636
I think there was, are there genres we
prefer more now than we did a decade ago?

65
00:04:31.636 --> 00:04:32.880
So let's try that.

66
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.130
Are there genres we prefer more
now than a decade earlier?

67
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.749
There was also,
I think the two of you were mentioning,

68
00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:46.990
do certain months have particular
genres that are more popular?

69
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.896
So do certain months have
genres that are more popular?

70
00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:57.257
So the reason why I wanted to get
away a little bit from versus,

71
00:04:57.257 --> 00:05:01.349
the versus is very correlations,
which is a really great thing to look at.

72
00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.045
But there's definietly other
kind of analysis we can do, so

73
00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:07.658
this temporal direction is really great.

74
00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:10.057
Yeah, so how do you feel about this?

75
00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:13.074
Is there other ones you want to
brainstorm and put out there?

76
00:05:13.074 --> 00:05:14.378
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Online there's a few.

77
00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:17.605
Which production company
makes more in the box office?

78
00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:19.970
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Ooh, that's a good one!

79
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.110
Which production companies
make more in the box office?

80
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.569
How about which ones get the best ratings?

81
00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.355
That might be interesting, too.
