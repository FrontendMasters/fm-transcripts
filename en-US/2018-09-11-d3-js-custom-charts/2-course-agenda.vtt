&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So for today, my goal is
to be able to get through these things.

2
00:00:05.121 --> 00:00:09.635
So we're going to start the first
section with data exploration and

3
00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:13.528
we're going to use observable notebook and
Vega-lite.

4
00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:18.735
And Vega-lite is one of these
like kinda grammars for building

5
00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:25.329
interactive visualizations that make
a lot of like the basic charts very easy.

6
00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.887
And then we're gonna talk about design
principles, and in particular we're gonna

7
00:00:29.887 --> 00:00:33.884
talk about marks and chanels,
as well as like Gelstalt Laws of grouping.

8
00:00:33.884 --> 00:00:38.780
And then we're going to take the designs
we come up with and our exercises.

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.799
And we're gonna turn them into code and

10
00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.374
we're gonna talk about SVG,
a little bit about SVG paths,

11
00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:51.246
and about D3, and shapes and
layouts that we can use from D3.

12
00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:55.490
And then we're going to finish
with annotations, axes,

13
00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.179
legends, things to make your
custom visualization readable.

14
00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.110
