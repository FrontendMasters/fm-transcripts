00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.227
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: To start with,
the D3 ecosystem, so

2
00:00:04.227 --> 00:00:09.376
how many of you guys have
looked at the D3 website?

3
00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:12.180
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yes.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.580
It's got a lot of sections, it's got
examples, and a whole page of tutorials,

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.410
and that's really awesome, but
I find it really extremely overwhelming.

6
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.840
So hopefully today will give you
the tutorials part of how to dive into it,

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.621
and then hopefully from now on you'll be
just coming to this page all the time,

8
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:36.038
which is the D3 [COUGH]
API Reference page, and

9
00:00:36.038 --> 00:00:40.857
then also notice all the different
modules that exist, [LAUGH] for

10
00:00:40.857 --> 00:00:44.010
D3 and I always find that extremely like,

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.575
do you guys find that overwhelming,
cuz I'm like, where do I even start?

12
00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:53.966
When I started, I was like my, when I
started, this library was a lot smaller,

13
00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.590
and even then I was like,
this is overwhelming.

14
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.861
I started in like 2012.

15
00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:02.923
So I've listed what I think
are some of the core,

16
00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:08.098
at least like the modules that I
use all the time, in my slide.

17
00:01:08.098 --> 00:01:12.870
So, I think,
yeah like selections I use all the time,

18
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.860
scales &amp; axes, and all of these, and then

19
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.230
if nothing else,
I think the selections API is really worth

20
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.720
reading all the way through after,
so this one.

21
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.200
After this workshop, I think it's really
worth reading through the whole thing,

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.880
because it goes into a lot, a lot, a lot
of detail about how things are working,

23
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.280
and how you can use them, and
all of the different options.

24
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.781
So, yeah.

25
00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:54.589
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So I just asked the chat,
what was their skill level between one and

26
00:01:54.589 --> 00:01:59.535
ten, and and
there was a lot of one to threes,

27
00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:03.657
and just a few fives,
and only one above five.

28
00:02:03.657 --> 00:02:04.810
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

29
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.570
we're definitely on the beginner skill
level in terms of in the chat room,

30
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.020
and so yeah.

31
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.031
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Cool.

32
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:15.428
That's perfect, because-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Even negative ones, and

33
00:02:15.428 --> 00:02:17.309
negative twos-
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: [LAUGH]

34
00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:18.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And zeros.

35
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.054
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: How does negative one work?

36
00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:22.957
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know.

37
00:02:22.957 --> 00:02:24.729
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Like you're
unlearning things as

38
00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:25.536
you-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Yeah.

39
00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.488
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Read through the [LAUGH],
you just get confused more and

40
00:02:27.488 --> 00:02:29.111
more as you read through
the documentation.

41
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:33.723
The documentation is extremely
overwhelming, because it literally gives

42
00:02:33.723 --> 00:02:37.909
you every single thing you need to
know about every single function.

43
00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.340
But I am glad one through three.

44
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.830
I think my slides can cater to that.

45
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.040
Yeah, so
on top of that what I want to show you is,

46
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.197
how many people have heard of this site?

47
00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:58.151
Actually, I'm gonna do this.

48
00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:03.794
Okay, so this site is called blocks.org,
bl.ocks.org,

49
00:03:03.794 --> 00:03:09.109
and it's kind of like,
I've noticed that each different

50
00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.459
little community has
their own online editor.

51
00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.906
CSS community has COPEN,
and there's JSFIDDLE.

52
00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:23.177
So with D3 we have this thing called
blocks where this is where we host,

53
00:03:23.177 --> 00:03:28.924
like where we do our visualizations,
and then we put them up, and

54
00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:35.946
this is a lot of where the community goes
to look at different examples with D3.

55
00:03:35.946 --> 00:03:40.755
And it's started by Mike Bostock,
one of the creators of D3,

56
00:03:40.755 --> 00:03:43.950
and he has a lot of amazing examples here.

57
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.691
I think he's like 3,000 examples or
something on this website.

58
00:03:47.691 --> 00:03:52.675
So how it works is [COUGH]
you see the visualization and

59
00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:56.753
then it actually gives
you the code used for

60
00:03:56.753 --> 00:04:01.865
that visualization,
usually in this index.html.

61
00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:07.917
So I know a lot of people use D3 by going
through blocks, and finding kind of like,

62
00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:13.119
the visualization that they think
they might need for their dataset.

63
00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:18.117
And then, because blocks
are essentially underlying GitHub gist,

64
00:04:18.117 --> 00:04:22.167
so they'll fork that, and
then plug in their own data,

65
00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:27.270
and then play around with that, and
a lot of people learn that way.

66
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.660
So blocks is definitely,
especially Mike's blocks,

67
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.660
are an amazing, amazing resource for
kind of even just looking at

68
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.680
everything that you could
do [LAUGH] with D3.

69
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.720
So yeah, keep blocks in mind,

70
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.180
and then today, what we will be using
is this thing called block builder.

71
00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.840
So this is block builder built
by Ian Angelot, rapper name,

72
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.900
who was the previous D3 instructor,
and he had this idea of,

73
00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.340
since blogs are essentially
just GitHub gist,

74
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.950
why not make an online editor that's
really easy to fork other people's blogs,

75
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.620
and just edit, and you don't have
to do any setups for git, or

76
00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.660
download anything, and this is what
we're going to be using today.

77
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.160
So, if you haven't done this already,
make sure to sign in.

78
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.822
Log in here, you can just log in here,
and then, it's essentially,

79
00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:43.545
you just essentially log in
with your GitHub username.

80
00:05:45.828 --> 00:05:48.281
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then,
I guess I would do that right now.

81
00:05:56.527 --> 00:05:58.564
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And
this is what the editor looks like.

82
00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:05.242
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then, the idea is,
I like doing side by side mode,

83
00:06:05.242 --> 00:06:07.862
and then the idea is you can just,

84
00:06:20.395 --> 00:06:22.419
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And edit right in there and

85
00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.099
see the changes, and
then when you press save,

86
00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:31.531
it will be added to kind of your own
profile, [COUGH] sorry, of blocks.

87
00:06:34.411 --> 00:06:39.560
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then the reason why
I absolutely love block builder is

88
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.257
because Ian and a few of our
friends built the search function.

89
00:06:45.257 --> 00:06:48.898
So if you go to blockbuilder.org/search,

90
00:06:48.898 --> 00:06:54.551
this is essentially all 21,000
blocks said they have indexed,

91
00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:59.080
made searchable super quickly,
with elastic search.

92
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:06.160
So you can be like, I want to see all the
blocks that I made with D3 version four,

93
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.210
and today,
I want to learn how to use D3 scale,

94
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.690
and I want to only see things from Ian.

95
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.750
Apparently he doesn't have that, okay.

96
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.620
I only wanna see things [COUGH] from Mike.

97
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.840
Interesting.

98
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:32.500
D3 scale, so I'm gonna use this.

99
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.945
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Maybe it.

100
00:07:34.945 --> 00:07:39.489
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Maybe I should be
doing functions, let me try that.

101
00:07:39.489 --> 00:07:45.351
Let me do scale linear, and
then I wanna see everything

102
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:50.194
that Ian has ever made with scale linear,
and

103
00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:56.056
then you can just find one,
and then look at his code and

104
00:07:56.056 --> 00:08:02.302
be like that makes sense,
or that doesn't make sense,

105
00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:08.674
and then if you want to just play
with it right there you can,

106
00:08:08.674 --> 00:08:15.471
and see what happens, and then,
you can fork it, and save it.

107
00:08:15.471 --> 00:08:16.005
So yeah.

108
00:08:16.005 --> 00:08:20.988
So this is what we'll be using for
all of our exercises today, and

109
00:08:20.988 --> 00:08:24.431
all of my code are linked
to block builder, so

110
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:28.070
you can play with any of
the code samples I have.
