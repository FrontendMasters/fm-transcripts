00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.360
&gt;&gt; Shirley: I want us to make that with
everything that we've learned so far.

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.400
With the first goal being just getting
all of these bars using the right scales.

3
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.260
And then a extra bonus if you
can get the axes in there also.

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.450
And I provided the starter code in there.

5
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.190
And, so this is the starter code and
then really briefly,

6
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.280
this data site is the temperatures

7
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.988
across a certain number of years for
three different cities and

8
00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:44.700
I've just, let me show you the data also.

9
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.640
This is what the data looks like,

10
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.190
I realize it's really ugly
to look at the raw data.

11
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.930
But it's essentially a CSV and

12
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.870
there's four attributes,
the date itself, the temperature for

13
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.586
New York, the temperature for San
Francisco, and the temperature for Austin.

14
00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:08.373
So,
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Will

15
00:01:08.373 --> 00:01:13.207
you make me a,
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Bar

16
00:01:13.207 --> 00:01:17.995
chart If all of the temperatures,
for any of, for

17
00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:21.529
one of the cities you're choosing,

18
00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.861
scale it correctly where
the x is your date and

19
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:31.447
the y is your temperature of
one of the cities and, yeah and

20
00:01:31.447 --> 00:01:36.349
this is kind of what we were
talking about before and

21
00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:39.980
Allison, yes that's her name.

22
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.350
And that was what we were talking about
if you have a nonstandard date format,

23
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.800
you can use three dot
time parse to get that.
