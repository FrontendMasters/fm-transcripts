00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.491
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So
what I want to happen is I'm, so

2
00:00:03.491 --> 00:00:08.496
this data set is a actual data set,
not one I made up.

3
00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:14.700
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: That's I think,
if I remember correctly,

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.820
the yield of barley across the years,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: For

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.340
certain sites across America.

6
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.290
I think there's six or seven different
geographic sites that grew their barley.

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:35.741
And then this is the data for their yield
across nine years, starting in 1927.

8
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.880
And so I've kind of already defined
a bunch of things for you, of like

9
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.370
the radius, and play with the duration of
how long you want your transition to be.

10
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.100
But I'm, I've also kinda given
you the xScale and yScale.

11
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.485
We talked briefly about scaleBand before,
but we didnt' go into details so

12
00:00:59.485 --> 00:01:06.300
feel free to look at the d3 scale API to
see how scaleBand works, and let's see.

13
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.480
And then let's see.

14
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.894
The goal is to have,
I have it written down.

15
00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:18.960
The x value,

16
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.610
the x axis is the different barley sites,
and that's why we're using scaleBand

17
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.140
because it's a discreet input and
you want a discreet output.

18
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.300
The y is the yield value for
each of those sites, and

19
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.530
then I want us to animate
across all the years.

20
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.240
So this is kind of what it will look like.

21
00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.480
I didn't put in the margin.

22
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.636
So this is why it's cut off.

23
00:01:40.636 --> 00:01:46.010
And it's basically, again,

24
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.850
using set interval, just animating across
all of the years and looping through.

25
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850
And I think I animate.

26
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.960
Feel free to do whatever
animations you want.

27
00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.063
But I think I animate the radius,
I think I animate the y position and

28
00:02:02.063 --> 00:02:05.178
I think that might be it, but yes.

29
00:02:07.663 --> 00:02:10.901
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then I might, and

30
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:16.054
then I think the data
set is just a whole big

31
00:02:16.054 --> 00:02:21.392
csv that just has year, yield, and site.

32
00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:24.992
So you're going to have to, so

33
00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:30.253
this is where I call setInterval and
update,

34
00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:36.010
and then I specify which
year I want to render.

35
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.210
And so in update, make sure to just filter
out the correct year to animate across.
