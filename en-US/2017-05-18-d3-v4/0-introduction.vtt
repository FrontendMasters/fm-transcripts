00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So, hi my name is Shirley,
I'll be teaching the T3 class today.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.450
A little bit about me to start with,
so that's my Twitter handle,

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.910
if you want to get in touch with
me later for some reason, and

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.140
I have a collaboration with my
friend Nadich called data sketches.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.750
And I'm really excited and
I want to plug this because

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.110
essentially what we do is
it's a 12 month long project.

7
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.730
And each month, we choose a topic and

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.116
we visualize it by the end of the month.

9
00:00:34.116 --> 00:00:39.285
And then,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And

10
00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:40.490
then we do a write up about it.

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.239
So we talk about our
data gathering process,

12
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.180
our sketching process,
and our code process.

13
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.020
So we've been told that it's a really,
really great both of us use D3 so

14
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.120
it's a really great resource for

15
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.070
people that are starting out in data
visualization, that are starting our

16
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.180
with D3 to kind of like look at our
process and see what we've done.

17
00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.250
So if you have the time,
please check it out, we'd be super happy.

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.520
The second thing is I'm a co-organizer for

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.970
the Bay Area D3 user meetup,
as well as the annual D3 unconference.

20
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.360
So if you get away from today being like,
my God, D3 is so awesome.

21
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.887
I wanna do this, like,
with my whole life, and

22
00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:23.682
you're like interested in meeting
other people that want to do this for

23
00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:27.566
their whole life or do this for
their whole life, with their whole life.

24
00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:31.960
Then we have an annual
unconference in San Francisco.

25
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.080
Of about 150 people that gather and

26
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.190
it's two days of just talking about D3 and
data visualization is great.

27
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.640
And I think it's going to be
late September this year.

28
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.310
So make sure to check us
out as well as finally,

29
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.490
I am a instructor for Metis,

30
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.610
which is a data science boot camp and
I'm going to be teaching there.

31
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.940
I'm going to be one of the instructors
teaching their data visualization class,

32
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.270
which is like six weeks in May.

33
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.920
And it's also available in Seattle,
New York, and Chicago,

34
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.460
I think, maybe Chicago soon.

35
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.030
And I wanted to make sure to plug them
because a lot of the things that I've

36
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.350
learned of like how to teach the course
comes from teaching their course and

37
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.780
I also use one of their examples so,
make sure also to check them out.

38
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.750
Yeah, that's all there is about me,
and here is the agenda for the day.

39
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.290
So, I want to start out by going
through the D3 Ecosystem because it's

40
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.450
like very big and vast and
kind of a little bit overwhelming.

41
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.370
And then we'll get into what I
like to consider the core of D3,

42
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.970
so how selections work,
how data binding works.

43
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.540
And how to enter-append,
essentially create DOM elements with D3.

44
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.250
And then we'll kind of get into
a little bit more of the fun stuff,

45
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.130
which I think of as like,
I guess scales aren't that fun.

46
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.610
But scales and axes, so
that you can create your own chart.

47
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.500
And then the shapes module
is also really helpful.

48
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.840
And then we'll go on to
what I think is the biggest

49
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.900
learning curve for D3, which is update and
exit, so enter, update, exit.

50
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.700
And then we'll do something
that's fun with the transitions,

51
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.850
the D3 animations and transitions.

52
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.096
And we'll end with a forced layout,
so I realize it's like,

53
00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:37.220
cuz D3 library is again vast, and it's
probably less than 10% of the whole thing.

54
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.832
So my goal isn't to teach you the whole
library, my goal is to teach you,

55
00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:47.163
what I think are the core and
how it works under the hood.

56
00:03:47.163 --> 00:03:51.763
And how to look at the documentation so
that hopefully by the end of the day, you

57
00:03:51.763 --> 00:03:56.437
can feel comfortable looking at the parts
of the library that I didn't cover and

58
00:03:56.437 --> 00:03:59.740
use those and
understand what's going on there.

59
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.424
And the second thing I realise I
don't mention is I call this workshop

60
00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:09.351
version four but I'm not going to be
like going through every single that

61
00:04:09.351 --> 00:04:14.380
has changed from version three to
version four cuz there's like a bunch.

62
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.768
So I'm hoping if I just cover the core and

63
00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:23.459
how those changed that we'll help
cover the version four part [LAUGH]
