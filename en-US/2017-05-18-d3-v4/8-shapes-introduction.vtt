00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.230
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And
thus far we've been using SVG elements.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.110
But I didn't wanna inundate you with
all of the SVG circles and all of that.

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.130
So we've been using only rect so far.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.080
And a rect is the x is the top left.

5
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.040
Y is the y-coordinate of
the top left within height.

6
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.960
There are quite a few other SVG
elements that we could be using for

7
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.950
our visualizations,
one of them being the circle.

8
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.190
And for circle,
it's essentially just CX and

9
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.270
CY are the x and y coordinate of the
center of your circle, and then a radius.

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.620
And those are the things that
you need to draw a circle.

11
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.510
A text element is a little
bit more involved.

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.760
The x and y coordinate,
usually we use a text anchor

13
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.950
is how we specify your alignment.

14
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.810
So text anchor could be,
I don't know why SVG had to go and

15
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.560
have a whole different set of language,
but

16
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.110
text anchor the values
start is like left align,

17
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.905
middle is center align,
and end is right align.

18
00:01:06.905 --> 00:01:10.054
Yeah, horizontal text alignment.

19
00:01:10.054 --> 00:01:16.884
And then my personal favorite
is the path element.

20
00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:20.054
And essentially a path element right now
is just like a straight line because I

21
00:01:20.054 --> 00:01:21.880
didn't know how to do
a squiggle on slides.

22
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.790
But it just takes this
little attribute called d,

23
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.290
which I think somebody was like
maybe it stands for definition,

24
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.280
or define, but [LAUGH]
it's

25
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.230
essentially you specify
the path to follow.

26
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.530
So you could be like,
I want this path to start at 0,0.

27
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.360
So move to 0,0, draw a line to 10, 10.

28
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.630
Have a curve that curves to 30,
30, or something like that.

29
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.780
And you can draw all
kinds of shapes with it.

30
00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.220
So the core functionality,

31
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.290
I won't go into all of the details
of how the d attribute of path works

32
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.050
because I think that's a whole another few
hours in itself until I get used to it.

33
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.900
But here is all of the main
commands that I use quite often.

34
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.805
Move to a point, line to a point,
curve to a pointy, arc to a point.

35
00:02:21.805 --> 00:02:26.779
And I just want to mention that because
if you just get yourself really

36
00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.939
comfortable with SVG paths.

37
00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:34.008
So I've linked to this document
that kinda describes all

38
00:02:34.008 --> 00:02:39.655
of the,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: This

39
00:02:39.655 --> 00:02:41.763
is what a d attribute looks like, and

40
00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:46.119
it's kind of ugly cuz you have to be
able to figure out what they're saying.

41
00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:50.964
I think that's move to 10,
10 horizontal line to x value 90,

42
00:02:50.964 --> 00:02:55.220
vertical line to 90,
horizontal and closed path.

43
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.570
So it's very involved,
but you just get it.

44
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:00.390
If you just learn it and

45
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.780
you can draw these paths,
all these different kinds of paths, arcs.

46
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.860
If you get yourself familiarize with this,

47
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.080
there are some beautiful,
beautiful shapes that you can make.

48
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.540
So one of them is this one.

49
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.130
So this is my project where I really,
really, really got.

50
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.826
Now I know curves like back of my hand,
I can just draw curves,

51
00:03:28.826 --> 00:03:33.365
[LAUGH]
which is

52
00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.980
not something that I need to brag about.

53
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.842
But for this project,
essentially this is move to, and

54
00:03:40.842 --> 00:03:44.160
then curve to, I think, this point.

55
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.008
And then another curve back to this.

56
00:03:46.008 --> 00:03:51.900
And just by creating a few of these
shapes and to these kind of petal shapes.

57
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.950
This is just, I think I'll use our
movetos, linetos, and curvetos.

58
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.730
You can make these petal
shapes that are really cute.

59
00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.130
And then if you just combine them together
and rotate them in certain ways and

60
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.540
size them in different ways
you can get these flowers.

61
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.780
You can curve these and

62
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.099
these are basically,
this is my project called film flowers.

63
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.960
And then so
I've basically scraped the data off IMDb.

64
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.640
And the size is the IMDb rating out of 10,
so the bigger it is, the better it is.

65
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.490
And then I just want to show you, and

66
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.840
the colors are the different
genres like comedy and stuff.

67
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.730
So, inception is one of my favorites.

68
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.180
Harry Potter, is one of my favorites.

69
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.890
I wanna show you my absolute favorite,
really quick.

70
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.514
This is my favorite, Batman and Robin.

71
00:04:43.514 --> 00:04:46.410
&gt;&gt; Students: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: [LAUGH] It's like, and

72
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.500
this is also using skills.

73
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.030
This is 3.7 out of 10 on IMDb.

74
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.510
And so it's just that tiny, and
I think the biggest might be,

75
00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.960
it might be inception maybe?

76
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.798
With like 8.8, maybe there was
another one that's bigger than that or

77
00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:09.600
something like that.

78
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.500
Yeah, so this is using scales.

79
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.890
Another thing that I wanted to
mention is it's using PaaS,

80
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.010
and it's using SVG Transform,
which we've been using a little bit.

81
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.980
And for transform, we've been
using this thing called translate,

82
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.770
which just pushes things down,
it pushes x and y.

83
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.430
But you can also scale things,
like literally,

84
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.410
you can scale things by 1x, 2x, 0.5x.

85
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.994
You can rotate things, you can skew
things, I've actually never use skew.

86
00:05:41.994 --> 00:05:45.657
But these things,
I don't want to go into detail but

87
00:05:45.657 --> 00:05:50.652
make sure to check out when you have
the time because if you just use these

88
00:05:50.652 --> 00:05:55.584
things in combination like,
you can just make these kinds of things.

89
00:05:55.584 --> 00:06:03.070
That are kinda pretty, and
people were really amazed by the flowers.

90
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.310
And they were like, my god,
that looks super intense.

91
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.000
And I'm like, no,
it was just a few curve commands.

92
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.420
I'm like, I just rotated things,
and that's it.

93
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.340
It took me a day, an afternoon.

94
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.220
So if you just understand things
things will come very easily.

95
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.560
And then this is just another example.

96
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.830
I think I might have broken it,
at some certain point.

97
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.770
But, it's just another
example to show you.

98
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.563
I think these were all just line tos, and

99
00:06:30.563 --> 00:06:35.587
I create a tiny little triangle, and
I just rotate that a bunch of times.

100
00:06:35.587 --> 00:06:39.201
And that's all that's happening and
people are like, whoa it's so pretty.

101
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:43.557
And I'm like, yeah, and it only took one
afternoon, just need to know these paths

102
00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:46.810
and transforms and
that's all you got to make pretty things.
