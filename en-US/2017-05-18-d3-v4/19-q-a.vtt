00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.245
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: How long have
you been working with d3?

2
00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:03.909
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Like the first time I ever

3
00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:07.482
set sight on it and
tried to use it was April 2011.

4
00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:11.141
I think it came out January 2011.

5
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:15.173
So I had a instructor at the time that I
was working with on a research project,

6
00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:16.857
and she was like try this d3 thing.

7
00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:22.268
Because before d3, I think it was
something like Graph Dracula,

8
00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:26.724
some very intensely scary thing,
and it was painful.

9
00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:28.290
And she was just like try out this d3.

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.514
But I think back then I had just
started taking CS classes and

11
00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:33.267
I didn't know any JavaScript.

12
00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:38.833
And I was super confused,
did not know how anything worked, and

13
00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:44.500
then a year later, I started at my
new job, and then they were like

14
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.129
hey there's this thing called d3 you
wanna try it out, and I was like sure.

15
00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.761
So August 2012 was when
I finally understood d3,

16
00:00:55.761 --> 00:00:59.294
like the whole data binding and.

17
00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:04.649
When that clicked, everything else in
the library just came so naturally for me.

18
00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.336
Yeah, so
August 2012 is probably the answer.

19
00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:10.902
It's been a while, yeah.

20
00:01:10.902 --> 00:01:16.656
And then React since
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: August 2014,

21
00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:19.469
September 2014, something like that.

22
00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.940
So using them together since September
2014 or something like that, yeah.
