1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.060
&gt;&gt; Shirley: So the exit section is
actually super straightforward,

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.050
which is most of the times,
all we do is go and remove it.

3
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.252
So once you get that, so, the .exit,

4
00:00:14.252 --> 00:00:22.160
all the .exit does is it just
returns this selection for us.

5
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.270
It just plucks out this exit selection,
so that you can operate on it,

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.170
and then, usually for
the exit selection, all we do is remove.

7
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.410
Sometimes we might do something fancy
with, maybe we'll animate it out,

8
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.980
like maybe we'll animate it to opacity
zero or animate the height down to zero or

9
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.360
something like that.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.960
And then remove it, but usually,

11
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.250
all we do is remove it, because it
doesn't need to be on the screen anymore.

12
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.513
The enter selection, usually
the way I think about it is I chain

13
00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:57.813
attributes that don't depend on the data.

14
00:00:57.813 --> 00:01:03.062
So like for example.

15
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.752
&gt;&gt; Shirley: I only chain attributes,
for example, for this particular one,

16
00:01:10.752 --> 00:01:13.100
the stroke is white, always.

17
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.670
Across all of the data changes,
across all the different states,

18
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.740
my stroke for each of these
bars will always be white, so

19
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.350
I don't need to update
that on each data change.

20
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.490
Same with the width, my width is
always whatever I set my rectWidth to.

21
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.280
So for the enter selection, chain the
attributes that don't depend on the data,

22
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.454
so that you don't have
to rerun the DOM there.

23
00:01:41.454 --> 00:01:47.175
And then, so,
actually I think what I forgot

24
00:01:47.175 --> 00:01:53.198
to mention is your update
selection is just what

25
00:01:53.198 --> 00:01:59.250
.data gives back, does that make sense?

26
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.007
So we do .data, and then for

27
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.050
enter and exit you have to access
it from doing .exit or .enter.

28
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.286
But for you to get the update selection
it's just whatever .data returns back,

29
00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:13.682
the .data returns you back
your update selection.

30
00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:18.591
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Should I set,

31
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:21.311
do you want me to represent-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

32
00:02:21.311 --> 00:02:26.423
we've like already been using the update
selection, every time we do .data, or?

33
00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:31.069
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Yeah, so, okay so,
if for example we do .data and

34
00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.636
then we do .adder, .adder .adder,

35
00:02:34.636 --> 00:02:39.190
then that would be editing
the update selection.

36
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.050
But most of the time what we've been
doing is doing .data, .enter and

37
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.811
so that's been getting us the enter
selection, but if we haven't done .enter,

38
00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:52.930
then we would be working off
of the update selection.

39
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.883
Yeah, so that's the little tiny detail,
so this is one of the,

40
00:02:58.883 --> 00:03:03.451
I guess, semi-big things that
change between version three and

41
00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:08.090
version four which is how
the update selection is treated.

42
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.540
And I personally the version four
is treated like the version four

43
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.972
might figure it out really well.

44
00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:19.720
But, remember what .data returns and

45
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.175
you can do, you can chain attributes or
chain like you know styles, author,

46
00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:31.890
and when you chain that author.data,
you're working off the update selection.

47
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.210
But the reason why I don't

48
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.200
particularly emphasize that as much is
because usually most of the time you want

49
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.510
to be working on the enter + update
selections, because you want to be working

50
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.000
on off of what's left on the screen
once you've removed the extraneous.

51
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.350
So that's the enter + update selection and

52
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.806
how you get that is essentially
you just merge them.

53
00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:04.760
So .merge is another D3 function that

54
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.710
all it does is takes two selections and
combines it into one selection, that's it.

55
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.326
So what's happening here is we're
taking the enter selection, and

56
00:04:15.326 --> 00:04:20.402
then we're taking this bars, which is our,
this bars is what .data returned us,

57
00:04:20.402 --> 00:04:23.467
so this bars is our update selection,
it's not.

58
00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:26.622
Yeah, this bars is our
update selection and

59
00:04:26.622 --> 00:04:30.206
then it's merging those
two into one selection so

60
00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:35.684
that we can set attributes on that whole
thing, of what is now on our screen.

61
00:04:41.813 --> 00:04:43.331
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Yes.

62
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:45.076
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The question
guy has a question,

63
00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:49.753
the reason why they're being merged,
enter.merge(bars), the reason why they're

64
00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:53.950
being merged is because they're both
displayed, right?, is that correct?

65
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:54.520
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Yeah.

66
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay,
now that makes a lot more sense, the exit,

67
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.450
we just removed that,
we don't render that, obviously?

68
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.200
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But we do need to merge

69
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.600
what is displayed which
is what is added and

70
00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.923
what is-
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Remaining, yeah.

71
00:05:07.923 --> 00:05:09.369
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, remaining.
&gt;&gt; Shirley: What is remaining, yeah.

72
00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:11.039
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,
that makes sense, thank you.

73
00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.571
&gt;&gt; Shirley: So, yeah,
usually you could set attributes on just

74
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:20.214
update selection, but
I find that to be really rare.

75
00:05:20.214 --> 00:05:24.468
Usually I find that I want to set certain
things on the enter selection and

76
00:05:24.468 --> 00:05:28.230
i want to set the things that
don't depend on data change.

77
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.390
And then I want to take everything
that's still on the screen

78
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.100
the added plus remaining,
and set attributes on that.

79
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.125
So then this last section is me talking
about with the enter + update selection,

80
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.096
I want to be chaining attributes
that do depend on the data.

81
00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:47.739
So because, if things change
from one state to the next,

82
00:05:47.739 --> 00:05:52.765
these are the, the x and the y and
the height, and all of that,

83
00:05:52.765 --> 00:05:57.603
are dependent on the data,
and that's what might change,

84
00:05:57.603 --> 00:06:00.747
and that's what should be rendered.

85
00:06:05.126 --> 00:06:07.011
&gt;&gt; Shirley: And
I think that might be it, you guys,

86
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:10.222
I think that's all I was going to
say about enter, update, exit.

87
00:06:10.222 --> 00:06:13.625
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So if you did
remove that merge, just because,

88
00:06:13.625 --> 00:06:17.453
you just left the enter,
you would see a very uneven,

89
00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:22.090
like because your x and
y would not be, not scaled properly?

90
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:27.500
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Well, not quite,
if you leave just the enter and

91
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.600
then you do .adder you'll see the only

92
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.340
the newly added bars will get
updated with the new data and

93
00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.390
the remaining ones will remain-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just as they are.

94
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.830
&gt;&gt; Shirley: Where it was
in the previous state,

95
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.700
yeah, and similarly if you do bars and

96
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.324
set all those attributes, but don't do it
to the enter, you'll see that actually.

97
00:06:50.324 --> 00:06:56.201
Like the added ones, nothing will happen
to them because you haven't set the x and

98
00:06:56.201 --> 00:07:00.989
y in height, and only the remaining
ones will get updated, yeah.

99
00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:05.755
So I think this is a super common
pattern for version four of D3,

100
00:07:05.755 --> 00:07:09.728
you exit and
then you do something with the enter, and

101
00:07:09.728 --> 00:07:14.075
then finally,
you do something with the enter + update.

102
00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:18.702
And you update all of those so
the next set of data sets,

103
00:07:18.702 --> 00:07:25.151
like you update those attributes
according to your next set of data, yeah.

104
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:29.927
Cool, cool,
okay let me just make sure, okay,

105
00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:35.173
let's, so I gave you this
piece of code to play with.

106
00:07:39.685 --> 00:07:43.687
&gt;&gt; Shirley: That's essentially
that code I have before and then,

107
00:07:43.687 --> 00:07:48.994
I just make sure to exit out of this
after a while cuz I use site interval and

108
00:07:48.994 --> 00:07:51.173
that crashes that like a tab.

109
00:07:51.173 --> 00:07:56.508
[LAUGH] After awhile, so just play with it
a little bit and then like exit out of it,

110
00:07:56.508 --> 00:08:01.450
but I think what I'm going to do is move
on to transitions and animations cuz

111
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:06.250
that's kinda fun and they come hand
in hand with enter, update, exit.

112
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.620
Cuz if you notice right now,
this one, it's adding things and

113
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.890
it's removing things, but there's no nice
animations that's going on between them.

114
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:17.910
So let me get through the animations or
the transition section, and

115
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:22.820
then we'll do 30 minutes exercise
with pretty much all of this.
