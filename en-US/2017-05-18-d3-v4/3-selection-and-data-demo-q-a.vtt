00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is stroke with a part of
the total width of the rectangle which is

2
00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.450
100 or is there more space needed for
the stroke width?

3
00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:12.997
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Man, so
stroke width is essentially a,

4
00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:16.624
I don't have the technical terms for
this but

5
00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:21.509
it's essentially centered so
if you have a hundred pixels.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.200
My guess, because I don't have
confirmation on this, is it will actually

7
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.390
be, if you have a, say,
two pixel stroke width, it should go 102.

8
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.480
Anybody can correct me on this.

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.480
And then it actually gets centered around

10
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.260
the rectangle such that
like there's one pixel

11
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.210
that goes into the rectangle and then one
pixel that goes out of that rectangle.

12
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.134
I wanted to do two things, the first is
I realize, so I should actually kind of

13
00:00:56.134 --> 00:01:01.206
console off things with you and
so that you can see how to do it.

14
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.166
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So,
this is basically all you are gonna do.

15
00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:14.755
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: And then if you
are much more used to the non ES6,

16
00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:22.036
all you have to do is
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: I

17
00:01:22.036 --> 00:01:24.839
think it was height minus d.

18
00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:34.825
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So
if you do the non ES6 function call,

19
00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:40.784
make sure that you are returning
a value every single time,

20
00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:49.090
or else D3 won't know what the value is to
apply to the attribute of that element.

21
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.810
So yeah, so you can be like,

22
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.710
this is what's returning for the y
attribute for each single one of them.

23
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.390
So that's the first thing I
wanted to make sure to do.

24
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.710
So you can console that log like this.

25
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.750
And then the second thing I wanted to
mention is with SVG I think like a lot of

26
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.620
the rendering system,
the coordinate system for X and

27
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.160
Y goes from the top of the screen.

28
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.310
Left to right, it goes zero and
increases for x, and for

29
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.800
y it goes zero and
increases as it goes down the screen.

30
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.110
Which is why you might have noticed,

31
00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:40.144
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: That there's something kind

32
00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:45.659
of weird going on here where why I
actually returned height minus the data.

33
00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.050
And that is because if I don't do that,
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: So

34
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.649
if I just return D,
well first off that happens.

35
00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:01.264
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Yeah actually that happens.

36
00:03:02.864 --> 00:03:05.816
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: You [INAUDIBLE], right?

37
00:03:05.816 --> 00:03:07.445
&gt;&gt; Shirley Wu: Wait,
no, [CROSSTALK] no, no.

38
00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:08.920
Sorry if I don't set the y.

39
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.610
That was the point I was trying to make.

40
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.670
Yeah, thank you very much.

41
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.890
If I don't set the y I'm It will actually
be outside down because it's just

42
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.120
saying okay I go in 0 0 and
then have the height.

43
00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.410
And so
if we don't want upside down bar graphs

44
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.800
we have to make to sure
to first do the height.

45
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.560
And then subtract the data from it and
then yeah this is the like

46
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.690
one thing to keep in mind when doing
like rectangles and staff with SVG.

47
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.750
For using likes and actually anything for
the constant system and SVG.
