00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then down here,
at the bottom, if we do all this stuff,

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.400
we have to rewrite the screen, right?

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.094
In fact, let's think about that for
a second.

4
00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:14.661
So here in handleNumber,
after we do all this stuff,

5
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:17.610
we basically rerender the screen, right?

6
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.620
Well, basically, anytime that
a user commits any sort of action,

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.490
we wanna rerender, right?

8
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.483
Not just on handleNumber,
but if they click clear or

9
00:00:27.483 --> 00:00:32.480
divide or, we're always gonna wanna
rerender what's showing on the screen.

10
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.925
So why don't we just move
this from line 30 here?

11
00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:39.903
Why don't we move it up into buttonClick,
right?

12
00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:41.756
Cuz on every button clicked,
this is gonna happen, so

13
00:00:41.756 --> 00:00:43.020
we might as well just put it up there.

14
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.927
So I'm gonna cut that up from line 30 and
I'm gonna put it on line 15 here.

15
00:00:54.382 --> 00:00:56.814
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That way it happens,
no matter if it's a symbol or a number,

16
00:00:56.814 --> 00:00:59.022
it's always going to rerender
what's in the buffer.

17
00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.552
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That make sense?

18
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.472
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again, I just moved that
from here in handleNumber to buttonClick,

19
00:01:08.472 --> 00:01:10.760
so that way,
I know it's always gonna happen.

20
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.729
So now what'll happen is,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if the number happens,

21
00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.820
once this finishes, it's gonna come back
to buttonClick once handleNumber finishes.

22
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.535
And then it's gonna rerender right there,
right?

23
00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:30.195
And same thing with handleSymbol,
which means now if I save this and

24
00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:34.470
refresh this page over here and
I put 25 and click C, works.
