00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.854
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna do
this in my editor over here.

2
00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.596
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm gonna create a new project.

3
00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:19.178
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: New Window, there we go.

4
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
I'm going to save this to my desktop.

5
00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:32.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: New folder,
call it calc, and

6
00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.263
this is gonna be index.html
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

7
00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:40.681
I'm just gonna go grab my HTML CSS
that I had previously done,

8
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:44.000
cuz we're just going to be worrying about
the JavaScript for this particular part.

9
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.290
Okay, if you click Raw here,
it'll give you just the raw thing here.

10
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.570
So I'm just gonna Cmd+A,
Cmd+C or Ctrl+C, Ctrl+A,

11
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.640
and then I'm just gonna paste that
over here into my index.html.

12
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.250
Create another file and
call this styles.css.

13
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.785
Same thing,
I'm gonna grab all my CSS out of here.

14
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.826
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Click the Raw,
Cmd copy all of that.

15
00:01:23.398 --> 00:01:27.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so let's make
sure that all this is yes, style.css.

16
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.700
Whatever you call this,
just make sure that it's the same link so

17
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.790
you could call it calculator.css
if you wanted to as well.

18
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.843
Okay, and
then we're gonna have calculator.js.

19
00:01:40.843 --> 00:01:45.353
Make sure that the link's
correctly down here, which is,

20
00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:48.881
I call it the same thing,
so that should work.

21
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:58.343
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So to recap, what I did
here is I went and grabbed the index.html,

22
00:01:58.343 --> 00:01:59.860
right?

23
00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.100
Or for you, if you're using your
previous one that you built with Jen,

24
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.750
just go ahead and work from there, okay?

25
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.480
I went and grabbed that HTML and
pasted it into a document.

26
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.308
I called it index.html, you could call it
calculator.html or whatever you want to.

27
00:02:12.308 --> 00:02:16.424
Then I went and grabbed the style
sheet here, the style.css,

28
00:02:16.424 --> 00:02:20.552
I think it's called calculator.css
inside the GitHub repo.

29
00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.504
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Went and
grabbed all that CSS that I had on there.

30
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.186
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

31
00:02:32.702 --> 00:02:35.357
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Made sure that linked
correctly here in the header for

32
00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:36.303
this stylesheet.

33
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:42.170
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then down here at
the bottom, I linked to a calculator.js,

34
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.798
which is what we're about to write.

35
00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:48.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the ./ for
the same directory optional?

36
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It is.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

37
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.120
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, force of habit for
me, so this ./ right here.

38
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.990
So if you have ../,
it means go up a directory, right?

39
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.779
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it a good habit
to have just to keep it so

40
00:02:57.779 --> 00:03:00.730
you know it's in the directory when
you're looking at the code and

41
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.377
not have to go back to your file path?

42
00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:05.364
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know.

43
00:03:05.364 --> 00:03:06.383
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Okay.

44
00:03:06.383 --> 00:03:07.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's equivalent.

45
00:03:07.921 --> 00:03:12.840
I really can't think of
an advantageous reason why I do this,

46
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.375
and that isn't to say
I always do it either.

47
00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:22.139
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think for

48
00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.410
me, if I'm gonna make some sort of
feeble justification of why I do it,

49
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.670
I can see that and
immediately know that's the path.

50
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.860
Whereas if I do this, I kind of have to
parse a little bit, is that a path or not?

51
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.190
But that's quite feeble, so yeah,
do what sounds good to you.

52
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.817
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Two dots and a slash
would mean it's in the folder above?

53
00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:48.490
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go up one, yep.

54
00:03:50.881 --> 00:03:53.347
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep,
dot represents wherever you are, right?

55
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:02.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so just to show
you how I wrote the JavaScript here.

56
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.440
If you're using your own HTML and CSS,
you're gonna have to adapt some of

57
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.260
the things I'm doing to how
you wrote your HTML, right?

58
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.420
So I have a screen class up here,
which represents the running total, right?

59
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.480
Like that's gonna be where
you gonna be displaying,

60
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.760
that's the black part at the top.

61
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.868
And then I have all these calc buttons
down here that have all of the numbers,

62
00:04:23.868 --> 00:04:27.920
and divisions, and back spaces,
and C's, and stuff like that.

63
00:04:30.128 --> 00:04:32.652
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that's pretty much it.

64
00:04:32.652 --> 00:04:36.850
That's for the HTML, the CSS, I mean,
you can go check that out later.

65
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.030
I don't think I did anything
particularly difficult here.

66
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.555
I used flexbox because I can
write flexbox in my sleep and

67
00:04:43.555 --> 00:04:46.200
I can never remember how to write grid.

68
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.565
So that's why I use flexbox everywhere.

69
00:04:51.407 --> 00:04:55.532
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When it comes to CSS, you
should 100% trust Jen over me, for sure.

70
00:04:55.532 --> 00:04:57.718
