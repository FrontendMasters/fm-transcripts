00:00:00.394 --> 00:00:03.879
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's do
the back arrow at the end.

2
00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.617
So let's go ahead and
go do the math symbols.

3
00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.775
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we could do this
in terms of if, else if, else if,

4
00:00:15.775 --> 00:00:16.744
else if, right?

5
00:00:16.744 --> 00:00:18.947
And that's totally fine if
you want to do it that way.

6
00:00:18.947 --> 00:00:21.032
I'm going to show you a little
bit different way of doing that.

7
00:00:21.032 --> 00:00:24.150
If you have like a bunch else ifs all in
one thing, you can do something called

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.803
a switch statement,
which are not super common in JavaScript.

9
00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:30.032
But it's probably worth knowing for you.

10
00:00:30.032 --> 00:00:35.066
So instead of doing this,
I'm going to do something called switch.

11
00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.014
And I'm gonna switch on the value, okay?

12
00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.401
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you're just
gonna give this a bunch of cases, so

13
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.707
you're gonna say, hey,
if value is this, do this.

14
00:00:44.707 --> 00:00:45.795
If it's this, do this.

15
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:46.498
If it's this, do this.

16
00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:49.568
And you're just switching
based on what value is.

17
00:00:49.568 --> 00:00:55.381
So the first thing I'm gonna put
here is case 'C', like that.

18
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:57.681
And then I'm just gonna move
what I had in here up into that.

19
00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:08.691
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna
look something like that.

20
00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:19.415
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So switch and
then you have curly braces here, right,

21
00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:22.671
that delimit what the switch statement is.

22
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:24.691
And then you're going to
give it a bunch of cases.

23
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:27.665
So you're gonna say case,
then whatever that case is.

24
00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:32.715
So in this case, if value is === C or
not value, symbol,

25
00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:39.600
rather, if some symbol is === C, then
go into this block and do these things.

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.421
Now a very key thing here is you
need line 28 here which is break.

27
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.611
Break says,
I'm done with my switch statement now.

28
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:51.193
If you don't have the break there it's
gonna go into the next block of things.

29
00:01:51.193 --> 00:01:53.935
I'll show you a little bit more
concretely what that means in a second.

30
00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:57.608
But suffice it to say,
at the end of every case you need a break.

31
00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:06.665
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next one we're
gonna do here, is we're gonna do,

32
00:02:06.665 --> 00:02:10.409
let's just do addition, okay?

33
00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.998
So I don't wanna to do
all the math thing here.

34
00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.812
So I'm gonna make another
function here called, handleMath.

35
00:02:14.812 --> 00:02:18.573
And I'm just gonna pass symbol into that.

36
00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:20.490
And then after that, again,
I'm going to call break.

37
00:02:25.423 --> 00:02:29.071
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I haven't
written handleMath yet,

38
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.608
we're about to write handleMath.

39
00:02:32.608 --> 00:02:36.541
So here, if I don't have the break,
once this is done,

40
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:40.075
let's just assume that I
don't have break here.

41
00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:44.358
It's just going to run into the next
body there if I don't put break.

42
00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:47.458
So that's why it's important to do that.

43
00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.666
Now that seems inconvenient.

44
00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:52.418
You might be thinking why did they
design the language that way?

45
00:02:52.418 --> 00:02:56.581
One, good question, but two,
there actually is a good reason for it.

46
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.503
The nice thing about them designing the
language this way is I can make a bunch of

47
00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:01.643
cases the same thing.

48
00:03:01.643 --> 00:03:05.778
So I can say case '-'

49
00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:14.056
case &amp;times, right?

50
00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:18.178
Case, what was it?

51
00:03:18.178 --> 00:03:22.440
&amp;divide, is that what it was?

52
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.725
We should look.

53
00:03:23.725 --> 00:03:24.566
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

54
00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:25.422
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool.

55
00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.112
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We can use the ampersand
in our HTML for everything.

56
00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:37.838
We would want to put that in
instead of a plus and minus, right?

57
00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:38.807
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think so.

58
00:03:38.807 --> 00:03:42.736
We should triple check
that because in my code,

59
00:03:42.736 --> 00:03:48.151
I just have the actual symbols there,
so let's figure that out.

60
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:51.115
Yes, good question.

61
00:03:51.115 --> 00:03:52.201
But this is nice though, right?

62
00:03:52.201 --> 00:03:56.925
We can put all the cases there for
all those various different things and

63
00:03:56.925 --> 00:03:58.823
it all will be handled here.

64
00:03:58.823 --> 00:03:59.819
So let's go and

65
00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.123
we can delete this now because we
rewrote it in a switch statement.

66
00:04:04.123 --> 00:04:09.049
So I would say switch statements are not
terribly common, but it's worth knowing.

67
00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.220
In this particular case,

68
00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.887
it is useful because that symbol
can be one of many, right?

69
00:04:12.887 --> 00:04:14.748
And so you have many cases
that we need to handle.

70
00:04:14.748 --> 00:04:19.805
And if we write a bunch of else ifs
it just kinda gets verbose, right?

71
00:04:19.805 --> 00:04:22.269
This is a little bit more succinct,
in my opinion.
