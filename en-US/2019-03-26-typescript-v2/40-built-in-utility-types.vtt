00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.530
&gt;&gt; Mike North: TypeScript comes
with a couple Utility Types and

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:07.160
they have recently added a couple more
that heavily depend on this conditional.

3
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.830
Number one is Partial.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.810
Partial just makes everything
on a type optional.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.130
This is great if you
have an options object.

6
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.430
Where you have maybe a set of defaults and

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.600
someone can pass you
a subset of those options.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.460
And you just wanna do sort of
an object merge, like a big splat.

9
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.640
So take whatever is given,

10
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.570
merger it into my fallbacks and
you have the full set of options.

11
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.160
So Partial has put a question mark next
to name and email, it may have email.

12
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.940
Pick allows us to select one or
more properties of something.

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.560
So, I've created a type called HasThen,

14
00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:01.326
it takes a type parameter and it's going
to pick of a promise, then, and catch.

15
00:01:01.326 --> 00:01:07.280
So let's see, so then I'm using the type,

16
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.280
I'm extracting off of promise.resolve
just, then, and catch.

17
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.940
And so there they are, if I were to
just grab then we would only see then.

18
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.390
If I'd made this a little simpler,

19
00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:36.681
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Then we don't
need the template here.

20
00:01:47.014 --> 00:01:48.775
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I didn't initialize it, but

21
00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:54.439
we can see only a is present,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Only b should

22
00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.980
be present here, or you can do b or
a and they should both be present.

23
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.470
So you're picking off of
an object type by property key.

24
00:02:08.204 --> 00:02:12.962
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Extract lets us, when
you have a big intersection type it'll

25
00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:18.100
let you select things that
are assignable to a particular type.

26
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.030
So give me only strings,
I misnamed this here.

27
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.506
Number, gives me only numbers.
