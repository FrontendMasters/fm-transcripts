&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
that's all I have everybody.

2
00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:08.890
I hope it was a useful and
fun exploration of typescript.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.871
I hope you walk away having
a better understanding of how type

4
00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:18.754
programming works and
where to apply type information, so

5
00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:21.893
that you get a lot of value out of this.

6
00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:27.742
Without running into some of the traps
where you overconstrain yourself.
