00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.170
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's apply our newly
learned three phase approach to converting

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.530
a piece of JavaScript
code into TypeScript.

3
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.550
So I've written such an example for you.

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.260
It's in the challenges
folder under address book.

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.980
And there's a little typo here
that's not index.ts, it is index.js.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.197
The only file in the address book folder,
so hopefully we'll figure that out.

7
00:00:40.234 --> 00:00:43.893
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's take a look at this
piece of code in order to understand

8
00:00:43.893 --> 00:00:45.615
the various aspects of it and

9
00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:49.590
where we might need to think
about type information.

10
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.040
So we've got a class here
called AdressBook and

11
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.590
we'll dig into that in a moment.

12
00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.666
We've got a function here
called the formatDate,

13
00:01:00.666 --> 00:01:04.520
getFullName, and getVcardText.

14
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.840
If you've never heard of Vcard,
you can create a Vcard file,

15
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.330
it's just a text file with
contact information in it.

16
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.840
And you can install this in
your contacts app or something.

17
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.290
In the AddressBook class, we have an array
that looks like it's for contacts.

18
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.720
A method to add contact, and
then find a contact by name.

19
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.850
So, the first of the three
steps has us renaming

20
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.070
this file from JS to TS, and
setting the TypeScript compiler

21
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.050
in a very loose mode until
we can get things passing.

22
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.240
Step 0 is making sure that the tests
pass before and after we are done.

23
00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:01.746
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay,
14 out of 14 tests passed.

24
00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:05.014
So, looks like we are good to get started.
