00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.187
So now that you've completed
Intermediate TypeScript V2,

2
00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:09.840
there are several different courses that
you now have the knowledge to take on.

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.443
One of them is making TypeScript stick.

4
00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:16.579
So that's a course based
around a lot of examples and

5
00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.561
a lot of hands-on practice that
you can use to take these skills

6
00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:25.240
that we've learned and
get a lot of exercise.

7
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.880
It's almost like personal training for
working with types.

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.885
Full Stack TypeScript is a course where
we build a Node.js backend and a React

9
00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:39.359
frontend and have type-checking that works
across both our backend and frontend.

10
00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:42.911
One set of types that sort of
connects the two worlds together.

11
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:48.071
Enterprise-scale TypeScript,
that's where we discuss linting,

12
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:53.667
project setup, how to achieve modular
architecture within a git.repo for

13
00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:58.127
a larger TypeScript project,
API surface extraction, and

14
00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:01.420
API documentation that uses your types.

15
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.733
You should also take a look at React and
TypeScript, taught by Steve Kenny, where

16
00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:12.280
he gets into the finer points of using
TypeScript within a complicated React app.

17
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.140
I hope you found this course useful.

18
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.080
I hope this gives you the knowledge
that you need in order to take your

19
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.379
TypeScript use and help your team take
your code bases to the next level.

20
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.652
Thanks for joining us, and
I hope you enjoyed the course.
