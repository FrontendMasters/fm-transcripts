>> So now that you've completed Intermediate TypeScript V2, there are several different courses that you now have the knowledge to take on. One of them is making TypeScript stick. So that's a course based around a lot of examples and a lot of hands-on practice that you can use to take these skills that we've learned and get a lot of exercise.

[00:00:25]
It's almost like personal training for working with types. Full Stack TypeScript is a course where we build a Node.js backend and a React frontend and have type-checking that works across both our backend and frontend. One set of types that sort of connects the two worlds together. Enterprise-scale TypeScript, that's where we discuss linting, project setup, how to achieve modular architecture within a git.repo for a larger TypeScript project, API surface extraction, and API documentation that uses your types.

[00:01:01]
You should also take a look at React and TypeScript, taught by Steve Kenny, where he gets into the finer points of using TypeScript within a complicated React app. I hope you found this course useful. I hope this gives you the knowledge that you need in order to take your TypeScript use and help your team take your code bases to the next level.

[00:01:26]
Thanks for joining us, and I hope you enjoyed the course. [APPLAUSE]
