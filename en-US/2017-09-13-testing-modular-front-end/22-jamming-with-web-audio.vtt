00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:05.120
Wanna hear a cacophony
of music in this room?

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.350
Please don't mute, just keep going.

3
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.674
I think maybe that,
We can all jam together.

4
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:50.944
[SOUND]

5
00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:12.083
[MUSIC]

6
00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:17.270
A different trick is if you wanna
make notes, really easy to do.

7
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.620
Just pick a bunch of numbers,
integers between negative 12 to 12, or so.

8
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.512
Western music has this thing
called 12 tone tonality.

9
00:02:27.512 --> 00:02:32.717
So as long you pick a bunch
of numbers that are good,

10
00:02:32.717 --> 00:02:37.680
you can do this little bit
of math where you take,

11
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.918
you index something from that array, and

12
00:02:41.918 --> 00:02:47.995
then you raise it to the 2,
to your number divided by 12.

13
00:02:47.995 --> 00:02:50.657
And you multiply that by a base frequency,
like 440.

14
00:02:50.657 --> 00:02:56.657
And it's gonna be you're pushing keys
on the piano, including the black keys,

15
00:02:56.657 --> 00:03:00.816
cuz there's 12 of those from
1 to the other [SOUND] so,

16
00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:06.422
[MUSIC]

17
00:03:06.422 --> 00:03:09.449
Here's a simple version of that.

18
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:21.554
[MUSIC]

19
00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:23.205
Can I add some distortions to that?

20
00:03:23.205 --> 00:03:33.205
[MUSIC]

21
00:04:14.638 --> 00:04:24.066
[SOUND]

22
00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:34.702
[MUSIC]

23
00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:37.955
Just the same tricks over and over again.

24
00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:41.945
The thing is, when you take these
waveforms, you can just add them together,

25
00:04:41.945 --> 00:04:47.055
and it's your ears can pick out
the waveforms from each other.

26
00:04:47.055 --> 00:04:52.970
So that's sort of why you can still
understand me when I'm talking over this.

27
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.130
Music, for example,
the same thing applies, but with addition.

28
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.065
And if you multiply waveforms,
then it mostly will just be quiet.

29
00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:06.688
A few other things to know is
sine waves are relatively soft.

30
00:05:06.688 --> 00:05:08.042
[MUSIC]

31
00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:09.881
Square waves are really loud.

32
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:12.388
[MUSIC]

33
00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:14.924
Triangle waves are somewhere in between.

34
00:05:14.924 --> 00:05:18.113
[MUSIC]

35
00:05:18.113 --> 00:05:21.692
Triangle waves have another cool thing
going for them though that you can do.

36
00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:24.972
[MUSIC]

37
00:05:24.972 --> 00:05:26.440
Let's see, get it.

38
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.560
Put that down a bit.

39
00:05:29.098 --> 00:05:33.581
And then,

40
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:39.670
[MUSIC]

41
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:44.710
You can make ridiculous

42
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.002
sounds really quickly.

43
00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:50.620
[MUSIC]

44
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.121
If your sounds are too obnoxious, you can
always multiply them by some other way,

45
00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:55.555
and then they sound more subtle.

46
00:05:55.555 --> 00:06:05.555
[MUSIC]

47
00:06:24.489 --> 00:06:25.799
I don't know, there you go.

48
00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:30.923
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

49
00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:40.923
[MUSIC]

50
00:06:42.307 --> 00:06:45.578
&gt;&gt; I spend a lot of time fiddling
with this kind of stuff, so.

51
00:06:45.578 --> 00:06:51.972
[LAUGH] That's all it takes, I guess.

52
00:06:51.972 --> 00:06:55.443
[MUSIC]

53
00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:56.170
All right, cool.

54
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.662
If you got any questions,
I'll just be right here.

55
00:06:58.662 --> 00:07:03.661
[LAUGH] Please do play with
all of those fun toys,

56
00:07:03.661 --> 00:07:07.124
which are now a part of your job,
cuz it's the web platform.

57
00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:10.542
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

58
00:07:10.542 --> 00:07:13.143
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Do you need me to sign any

59
00:07:13.143 --> 00:07:14.813
letters or whatever?

60
00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:16.661
I can do that.

61
00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:18.720
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] This is part of my job.

62
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.036
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
