00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.042
Some other things that
make testing easier,

2
00:00:03.042 --> 00:00:07.769
I don't know where I first encountered
this idea, but it's really good idea for

3
00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:11.890
writing both reusable code and for
writing code that's easy to test.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.263
It's the idea of the IO shell.

5
00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:18.820
That's where you try to defer
all of the places where you're

6
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.910
gonna use input/output.

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.682
So these are things where you what
you're doing has kind of like

8
00:00:25.682 --> 00:00:28.034
an effect on the environment.

9
00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:32.242
So that might include something like
reading from a file or writing to a file,

10
00:00:32.242 --> 00:00:34.430
these kinds of operations.

11
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.129
If you can kind of push those up to the
uppermost layer so that it's configurable,

12
00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.352
it'll be a lot easier to run your code
in different kinds of environments.

13
00:00:45.352 --> 00:00:51.432
Like a web browser, or on some other
kind of system, or kind of in a testing,

14
00:00:51.432 --> 00:00:56.467
in a way where it's easy to kind
of provide synthetic inputs and

15
00:00:56.467 --> 00:00:59.280
get synthetic outputs.

16
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.780
An example of what that might look like
is if you have a piece of code where

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.310
normally you have a module called foo.

18
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.023
And by default,
it uses the fs module behind the scenes.

19
00:01:12.023 --> 00:01:17.260
But you also maybe don't want it to do
a bunch of stuff on your file system.

20
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.270
So what you can do is pass in an optional
fs argument that's like fake-fs.

21
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.987
And it's just in memory, for example.

22
00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:28.946
This will make your
tests run a bit faster.

23
00:01:28.946 --> 00:01:33.436
Although I would caution a little bit, if
you use too many of these fake libraries,

24
00:01:33.436 --> 00:01:37.160
sooner or later, you're gonna hit
a bug in one of those libraries.

25
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.554
And then it's like you're kind of a little
bit far removed from the real system.

26
00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:44.225
So it's just good to use a mix,
I would say,

27
00:01:44.225 --> 00:01:46.621
of both real system calls when you can.

28
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:50.902
But sometimes it's better
to also use fake ones.
