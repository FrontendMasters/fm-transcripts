00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.680
I'm gonna talk now about
modular web development.

2
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.375
So what do I mean by this?

3
00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:09.035
Using dozens and
dozens of tiny, single purpose,

4
00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:14.070
simple NPM packages to do pretty
much anything that you'd want to do.

5
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.550
So we already saw a little bit of this
in the testing section with these

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.400
pretty small, pretty well defined pieces
that you can easily wrap your head around.

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.970
This is how I like to
put together web apps.

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.910
And in fact, it's that way of doing,

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.830
of composing web apps is powerful enough
to do I think pretty much anything that

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:40.520
a big frameworky would
claims to provide you.

11
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.396
But has a lot of its own baggage that
maybe you wanna see another way of

12
00:00:44.396 --> 00:00:47.592
doing it where you don't have
to have a big config file,

13
00:00:47.592 --> 00:00:50.522
where you don't have to
have a lot of other pieces.

14
00:00:53.191 --> 00:00:57.702
So, an important thing about the web these
days is that we're not just dealing with

15
00:00:57.702 --> 00:00:58.870
HTML files anymore.

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.850
We've got real time connections
with WebRTC, with WebSockets.

17
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.100
We've got things like service
workers that can sort of

18
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.750
proxy the network connections
to your whole application.

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.560
We've got all kinds of different
ways of formatting your webpages and

20
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.286
making them responsive with sort
of these reactive architectures.

21
00:01:21.286 --> 00:01:24.352
We've also got a database in the browser,
but

22
00:01:24.352 --> 00:01:28.590
I haven't really seen much adoption for
it, but it's there.

23
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.892
And we should be doing more things with
it because it's fantastic functionality.

24
00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:39.251
You can make audio and
visual presentations,

25
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:43.567
which I'll be doing some live coding for,
toward the end.

26
00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:49.977
All of this stuff that's in the web now,
and I think it's just a bit sad there,

27
00:01:49.977 --> 00:01:55.807
a lot of what you hear about web
development is just making HTML forms and

28
00:01:55.807 --> 00:01:58.650
which, we'll get into that too.

29
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.790
But there's just so much there to explore.

30
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.970
What I recommend for
all projects is, if you can,

31
00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.810
it's really good practice
to start from zero.

32
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.821
And this also,
this kind of this practice will sort

33
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:17.532
of push you toward using simpler tools
that you have to completely understand.

34
00:02:17.532 --> 00:02:21.023
And I think it also,
from my efforts in teaching people,

35
00:02:21.023 --> 00:02:25.972
really helps with getting a good working
memory of all of these different tools,

36
00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:28.620
how to set them up, how to configure them.

37
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.200
Because it's so
easy to clone someone else's boilerplate,

38
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.840
and then you don't understand any of it.

39
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.225
And if it breaks, you're sort of lost,
and you have your own custom changes, so

40
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:41.530
your boilerplate isn't like
anyone else's after a while.

41
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.660
And it's just not the best
way to go about things.

42
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.500
So this does take a little
bit more practice and

43
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.110
a little bit more effort at first,
but I think that it's what I do, and

44
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.360
it's what I recommend that even
beginners should try to do if they can.
