00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.170
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What I want to do next
is, we already have that LED wired up.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.910
What I want to do is kind of marry
the two things we were just doing.

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.290
We can now know when a button
is pressed or released.

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.430
We also have the ability
to turn an LED on and off.

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.810
What if, bare with me here,
we turn the LED on or

6
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.440
off depending on whether or
not the button was pressed or released.

7
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.270
I know I know.

8
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.710
So let's go ahead and take a look at that.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.930
To match up with the diagram
that I made earlier.

10
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.070
The stargrams take a lot of time.

11
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.400
I put my LED back on a zero.

12
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.640
If you wanna leave yours on a five,
that'll work.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.590
Remember, for turning on and
off any pin will work.

14
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.665
I just wanted to keep it
consistent with the diagram.

15
00:00:49.665 --> 00:00:52.010
That felt like
the responsible thing to do.

16
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.460
So I'm gonna just change
my code real quick.

17
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.414
And I'll say a0.

18
00:00:56.414 --> 00:00:58.380
And I'm not gonna do anything
with it immediately.

19
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.940
Here I can go ahead and
turn these into, I'll say,

20
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.760
when it's pressed we'll do led.on.

21
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.300
And when it's released, do led.off.

22
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.530
Cool.

23
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.543
And what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to deploy that code from the playground.

24
00:01:21.543 --> 00:01:22.112
All right, good.

25
00:01:22.112 --> 00:01:23.040
The code has deployed.

26
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.270
I can press the button.

27
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.690
The LED turns on.

28
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.420
I release the button, the LED turns off.

29
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.610
You'll notice that I can't help
myself from doing this repeatedly.

30
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.205
It's very gratifying, right?

31
00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:41.260
I can't, I know.

32
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.690
I write professional software applications
all day, I do very complicated things.

33
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.894
And yet this is literally
incredibly rewarding for me.

34
00:01:50.894 --> 00:01:57.990
So I know that you want to, so
just give yourself a second and indulge.
