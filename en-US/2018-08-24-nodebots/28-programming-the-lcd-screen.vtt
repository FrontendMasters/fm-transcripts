00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.430
&gt;&gt; Steve: I believe we've
got our LCDs wired up.

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.255
Again, it was definitely the boss level
of all the wiring we've done today,

3
00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.290
definitely after the fake
out of the door switch.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.290
Right, yeah,
just plug these two cords and it's fine.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.231
This was a little bit more complicated
because we had to give power to

6
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.000
both sides.

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.251
Luckily, where the wiring is complicated,

8
00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.023
the code is coded easy.

9
00:00:25.023 --> 00:00:29.025
So, let's go ahead and
look at how we can program this, cool.

10
00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:33.068
So, here I have just kind of
the playground again cleared out from

11
00:00:33.068 --> 00:00:34.328
the previous code.

12
00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:41.406
Johnny-five makes all of this suspiciously
easy, so I can say a new five.LCD.

13
00:00:41.406 --> 00:00:46.266
And you do need to tell it what
ports those are, in the diagram,

14
00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:49.490
the white wires are plugged into.

15
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.640
Luckily, they are in sequential order.

16
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.680
So we'll just say pins.

17
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.424
And we'll give it an array of,
mine are plugged into a2.

18
00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.213
And if you follow the diagram,
yours are too.

19
00:01:00.213 --> 00:01:06.495
a3, a4,

20
00:01:06.495 --> 00:01:12.777
a5, a6,

21
00:01:12.777 --> 00:01:15.922
a7.

22
00:01:15.922 --> 00:01:19.562
The easy way I did it kind of wired
it up and start from the last pin and

23
00:01:19.562 --> 00:01:20.880
go the other way.

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.530
But that wouldn't work for
the programming.

25
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.490
So, I have this new LCD that is
ready to go based on the wiring.

26
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.500
And for this, you kind of have a cursor
that you can like reposition and move.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.950
So it's useful to think
about the LCD as two rows.

28
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.980
There is that top row and
then there is the bottom row.

29
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.234
And that is the one that came in the kit.

30
00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:51.370
But obviously not all LCDs are monochrome,
and two rows of 16 columns, right?

31
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.410
So this API is flexible for
all the different kinds of LCDs out there.

32
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.180
But we're kind of focused on the one
that we have available, right?

33
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.559
So we can actually print some text to it.

34
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.980
And as I put this together, I do want
you to start thinking about kind of,

35
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.310
again, some of the stuff we talked about.

36
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.930
You could have one of these set up and
pull in from a third party weather API and

37
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.540
just display it.

38
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.094
This is just what's in the kit, there's
also EN screens that you can set up and

39
00:02:20.094 --> 00:02:23.115
stuff along those lines,
that can be Internet connected,

40
00:02:23.115 --> 00:02:25.745
pull in the weather and
put it right by your door, right?

41
00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.305
All sorts of really cool stuff.

42
00:02:27.305 --> 00:02:30.955
The really interesting stuff
comes when you start overlapping

43
00:02:30.955 --> 00:02:33.675
a bunch of stuff on
the Internet with this.

44
00:02:33.675 --> 00:02:37.355
So we basically put the cursor
somewhere and you can

45
00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:40.880
see through some helpful IntelliSense
here that it takes two things,

46
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.330
a row and
a column of where we wanna put the cursor.

47
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.820
I'm gonna start at the very beginning,
but you could theoretically

48
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.530
start on the 0 row and
halfway through the LCD if you wanted to.

49
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.080
And then we'll just print.

50
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.394
We'll print, Hello.
&gt;&gt; Steve: And

51
00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:05.183
then on the second row,
[INAUDIBLE] you wanna do.

52
00:03:05.183 --> 00:03:07.352
Hello?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

53
00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:08.696
&gt;&gt; Steve: Which one?

54
00:03:08.696 --> 00:03:10.913
What are we doing?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: He said 47.

55
00:03:10.913 --> 00:03:13.800
&gt;&gt; Steve: Hello 47 into it.

56
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.480
And the other thing you can do,
if you've ever used Slack,

57
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.250
you have that emoji shorthand.

58
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.140
They're not emojis per se, but
there are a few symbols that you can

59
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.720
see in the Johnny-Five documentation,
so I'm gonna go with a heart.

60
00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.287
This is how I feel about
all of you at this point,

61
00:03:28.287 --> 00:03:29.961
after all of our time together.

62
00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:32.797
So I'll put that together and

63
00:03:32.797 --> 00:03:38.705
this is really all it takes to be
able to print to an LCD screen.

64
00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:41.792
So I'm gonna fire up this code and
then we'll go take a look at it.

65
00:03:41.792 --> 00:03:46.698
So I'm still deploying a code, but it
should be starting up in about one second,

66
00:03:46.698 --> 00:03:48.225
it's running the file.

67
00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:53.263
And you can see that it's come to life,
my heart didn't work out.

68
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:57.870
But you can see exactly what
I typed appeared on the LCD.

69
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.010
So I mean we still feel
a heart in this case.

70
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.340
So yeah,
we can print whatever we want to this.

71
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.000
For our next trick,

72
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.990
the one last thing I wanna do is
again think about an API integration.

73
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.550
So I'll give you all a few minutes and
what we'll do is if you don't have

74
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.090
a Twitter API key,
go ahead and get it yourself.

75
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.868
If you don't have a Twitter account, you
will need one, technically, but otherwise,

76
00:04:24.868 --> 00:04:28.454
you can kind of go to the Twitter API
section and go get it yourself.

77
00:04:28.454 --> 00:04:31.986
There's actually four parts to it, I
think, a consumer key, a consumer secret,

78
00:04:31.986 --> 00:04:32.803
so on and so forth.

79
00:04:32.803 --> 00:04:37.141
And if you look in that environment
configuration that we saw before,

80
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:41.699
that env.sample,json, you'll see
the places to plug all of that in and

81
00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.072
you can put in each one of those parts.

82
00:04:44.072 --> 00:04:46.058
If you don't have a Twitter account and
you just want to follow along,

83
00:04:46.058 --> 00:04:46.639
that's great too.

84
00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.330
But if you wanna actually pull in
something as well, we can get that going.

85
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.523
I'll give everyone
