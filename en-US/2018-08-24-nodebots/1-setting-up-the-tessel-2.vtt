WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.719
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.
So what we do now,

2
00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.020
is we're actually going
to set up our Tessel 2.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.935
So attached to my computer right now,

4
00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:12.408
I have a brandnew Tessel 2 that
I have never set up before.

5
00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:13.449
We're going to set it up together.

6
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:19.775
Now tessel.io/start which will
actually resolve to this longer URL.

7
00:00:19.775 --> 00:00:24.165
There are instructions for whatever your
operating system is to get up and running.

8
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:30.600
I am going to go through the Mac OS
instructions because I am using a Mac.

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.850
My suspicion is that if I try run
the Windows commands on my Mac,

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.500
it's not going to go well.

11
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.900
So I'm going to stick with
the Mac instructions.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.720
But this will kind of get you through
to getting this set up either way.

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.907
The one kind of general purpose
command line tool that we're

14
00:00:46.907 --> 00:00:53.218
gonna use is the Tessel 2 CLI,
which we're gonna saw globally from NPM.

15
00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:57.677
One thing that I've noticed,
kind of preparing for

16
00:00:57.677 --> 00:01:00.918
this is Note 10 recently came out and

17
00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:06.770
installing some of the tools on
Node 10 is not fully there yet.

18
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.990
You can try it out if you have Xcode.

19
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.010
It'll actually try to compile
the modules and everything will be okay.

20
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.590
But if you're Node 10 and you don't have
Xcode, things can get a little weird.

21
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.567
So you're better off using either Node
8 or 9, and you should be totally fine.

22
00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:26.350
If you have something like NVM installed,
you can switch between versions of Node.

23
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.205
We'll deal with that if somebody
has an issue with it, but

24
00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:35.249
I suspect it was only when I cracked open
a new computer and took it for a spin.

25
00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:38.290
And I put the latest and fanciest
version of Node that I had that problem.

26
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.480
So generally speaking,
it shouldn't really be an issue.

27
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.900
So we're gonna run this command.

28
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.320
I actually already have the command
line tool installed but

29
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.380
I will run it to be a good sport.

30
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.053
So we'll just do this npm install t2-cli.

31
00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:58.123
For me, it's gonna go fairly
quickly cuz I do have it installed.

32
00:01:58.123 --> 00:02:00.808
Apparently num num is no longer supported.

33
00:02:00.808 --> 00:02:05.679
That's a fun fact but
it doesn't actually affect us.

34
00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.547
So to pull it down, go ahead and
install everything.

35
00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:11.108
Although, it might take
slightly longer for you.

36
00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:14.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Not too much longer.

37
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:21.320
So as I run to kind of explain
the next few steps is we do need

38
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.420
to find our Tessel, which if you don't
already have it plugged in via USB.

39
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.370
Now is a good time to do it,
cuz it'll be very hard for

40
00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.550
you to define Tessel,
unless it is plugged in.

41
00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.180
That seems obvious, but once you set
up WiFi, if you bring it home and

42
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.290
you're using it there, that's actually not
always true, cuz it's connected via WiFi.

43
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.885
But at this exact moment,

44
00:02:42.885 --> 00:02:46.447
it does definitely need to be
plugged into your computer.

45
00:02:46.447 --> 00:02:49.590
Cool, so
I'm gonna give everyone a minute or

46
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.826
two just to run that
npm install -g t2-cli.

47
00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:57.199
And if everyone can just make
uncomfortable eye contact with me when

48
00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:01.580
that's installed, that's how
I'll know that we're good to go.

49
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.017
Great, so at this point, everyone's got
the Tessel 2 command line tool installed.

50
00:03:07.017 --> 00:03:09.630
Despite the fact that we
did npm install t2-cli,

51
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.830
all we have to do from this point forward
is type t2 from the command line.

52
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.080
So what we'll do is this t2 list which
will list all the devices currently

53
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.780
connected to our computer.

54
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.260
So I'll go ahead and try that out.

55
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.280
Searching for nearby tessels.

56
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.960
You can see I found one with a very
cool name right here called Tessel,

57
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.020
I'm not saying that out loud.

58
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.980
So we found the one
connected to my computer,

59
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.260
like your numbers will
obviously be different.

60
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.880
That's the unique identifier, it's about
to get a lot more unique because the next

61
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.210
thing we can do is rename it to
something a little bit more tolerable.

62
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.270
So you can name it anything you want,
their suggestion here is Bulbasaur.

63
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.510
When I was kind of
putting things together,

64
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.470
it was a great father-son bonding
experience with my 5-year-old.

65
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.290
I'm sorry, he's 5 and a half,
and I was like, okay,

66
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.540
what do you want to name it?, and so

67
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.580
he chose to name it RobotComputer, which
I thought was very inspired and original.

68
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.990
So you can name yours whatever you want.

69
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.250
I'm going to take his advice,
and name mine RobotComputer.

70
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.440
Now, let's say for instance you were
building some home automation stuff,

71
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:25.100
it could be like Tessel in the cupboard
to make sure no ones stealing my cookies,

72
00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.990
or something like that.

73
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.450
That's probably a really long name.

74
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.040
But you could, if you had multiple
tessels, you could probably name them

75
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.480
something very relevant to
their purpose in your life.

76
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.580
But right now,
you can just name it whatever you want.

77
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.559
If you are struggling to come up with
a name, might I recommend RobotComputer,

78
00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:45.390
or RobotComputer2, or
some combination thereof.

79
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.538
Johnny Five, all of these are fair and
good options.

80
00:04:49.538 --> 00:04:53.479
Cool, so now we have it configured.

81
00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.082
We have it named.

82
00:04:55.082 --> 00:04:58.004
The next part is
connecting it to the WiFi.

83
00:04:58.004 --> 00:05:02.512
At one point, we're not going to program
it over WiFi but at given point,

84
00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:05.040
we are going to run a websurfer on it.

85
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.950
Spoiler alert.

86
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.310
It's always great when people say
spoiler alert afterwards, right?

87
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.951
So we do want to connect it to the WiFi.

88
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:16.748
So, and the way that works is t2 wifi, and

89
00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:21.290
you give it the -n for the network name.

90
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.150
And that is MJGworkshop, and the password.

91
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.140
I hope this wasn't secret.

92
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.490
We're on the 36th floor,
I don't think anyone's sitting outside

93
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.740
the building trying to steal WiFi,
so I think we should be good.

94
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.320
We can try both of those.

95
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.160
If you find yourself wanting to use
WiFi that doesn't have a password,

96
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.370
that's always suspicious.

97
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.200
But you can just actually
not put that -p and

98
00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.450
it will only connect to a WiFi
network without a password.

99
00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.770
So take that for a spin.

100
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.170
And it's gonna look for my Tessel
which is still connected via USB.

101
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.568
It's connected to RobotComputer.

102
00:06:04.568 --> 00:06:07.720
It's basically going to
connect it to the WiFi.

103
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.660
All right, very cool.

104
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.850
One other thing that we're
going to need later but

105
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.370
I'm just going to show it to you now.

106
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.100
Is if you just type in t2 wifi,
you'll actually get some

107
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.400
information about what network it's
connected to, as well as the IP address.

108
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.464
Which is if we want to hit
it as a web server, useful.

109
00:06:22.464 --> 00:06:28.035
So that is the local IP
address of my RobotComputer

110
00:06:28.035 --> 00:06:32.022
connected to my MacBook right now.

111
00:06:32.022 --> 00:06:34.927
So if I spin up a web server and
I need to go visit it,

112
00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.669
this will be where I go visit.

113
00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:40.891
Yours will obviously differ slightly,
depending on your IP.

114
00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:44.855
Cool, so now we've got it connected
to the WiFi, so far so good.

115
00:06:44.855 --> 00:06:46.724
Is everyone feeling good?

116
00:06:46.724 --> 00:06:54.110
Cool, all right, so now the other thing,
we're not gonna program it over WiFi but

117
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.510
we're gonna kinda go through these
steps for posterity which is if

118
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.890
you had a Tessel 2 and
you wanna program over WiFi.

119
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.470
It's probably not great if anyone
connected to your WiFi network

120
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.360
can go ahead and
program your Tessel 2, right?

121
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.160
That's probably bad.

122
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.320
That means somebody sitting outside your
apartment could theoretically reprogram

123
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.260
your hardware.

124
00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.450
So the way this works is that your
Tessel 2 uses effectively, key pairs.

125
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.058
So we have a public and
a private key and you basically say,

126
00:07:26.058 --> 00:07:29.532
hey, this computer is allowed
to program it over WiFi.

127
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.862
And the way we do that
is teach you provision.

128
00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:38.821
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
it will go ahead and look for it and

129
00:07:38.821 --> 00:07:40.960
then basically authenticate it back and
forth.

130
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.790
So now, go computer is setup with
your Tessel if you did need later

131
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:45.930
to program it over WiFi.

132
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.470
And we'll just do a t2 list.

133
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:51.210
Actually technically,
you see like two of them now.

134
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:55.962
Well you'll see more if you have
a bunch of friends in the room.

135
00:07:55.962 --> 00:08:02.460
[COUGH] You'll actually see more if you
have a bunch of friends in the room.

136
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.520
So here are all of our Tessels.

137
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.440
The fun thing that we got to do together
is find out what we all named our Tessels.

138
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.660
All right, so we've got
RobotComputer there, we've got Fred.

139
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.699
Very cool, we have JabbaTheBot,
I like that one.

140
00:08:15.699 --> 00:08:18.220
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Pixie dust, very cool.

141
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.210
And you can see effectively which one.

142
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.223
I can go ahead and
provision any of those as well.

143
00:08:26.223 --> 00:08:28.570
Cool.

144
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.560
So the next thing we're gonna do just to
get us all on the same page is just update

145
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.410
them all with the latest firmware.

146
00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.900
These are all new, but who knows how
long they've been sitting on a shelf.

147
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.505
So we'll take that first one.

148
00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:42.678
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah?

149
00:08:42.678 --> 00:08:47.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So I'm connected to
my Tessel via both USB and LAN.

150
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.032
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: This firmware update,

151
00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:52.270
what's it occurring over, does it choose?

152
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.470
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Generally speaking,
if USB is available,

153
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.869
you can actually when we deploy code,
you can do --LAN or

154
00:08:59.869 --> 00:09:04.810
--USB if you have like strong feelings
in which one you wanna go over.

155
00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.845
I don't have like strong, we were
go over the USB generally speaking.

156
00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.586
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: But for
those of you who like doing it at home,

157
00:09:14.586 --> 00:09:16.710
if you want to do it over WiFi,
that's totally fair.

158
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.420
The only reason why we're not
doing it over WiFi is because

159
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.520
humans in the room together.

160
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.850
The humans aren't actually the problem,
it's the devices, right.

161
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.080
It's the, how many laptops
connected to how many tessels.

162
00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.724
The humans actually don't
have an impact on the WiFi.

163
00:09:34.607 --> 00:09:35.652
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

164
00:09:35.652 --> 00:09:38.471
So now, we have a new process that
will take at least two minutes.

165
00:09:38.471 --> 00:09:43.383
I don't like, I like the confidence in
that two to four minutes earlier more

166
00:09:43.383 --> 00:09:47.170
than I like these two minutes
that I'm getting now, but.

167
00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:51.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It definitely doesn't
work with ten or something else.

168
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah, I can confirm
that it is not work with Node 10

169
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.180
unless you have like Xcode installed or
whole bunch of other stuff.

170
00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.020
I didn't have Xcode installed and

171
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.160
hotel WiFi was not the WiFi to
download 5 gigabytes of Xcode.

172
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.099
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I should have that but
I might have accepted that, too.

173
00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:08.736
I used NVM to go back at nine.

174
00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:09.692
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep.

175
00:10:09.692 --> 00:10:10.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And
that's not working either.

176
00:10:10.672 --> 00:10:11.602
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Nine is not working?

177
00:10:11.602 --> 00:10:14.162
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: No.

178
00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:16.587
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Do a node -v
to make sure actually on nine.

179
00:10:16.587 --> 00:10:22.379
I don't trust NVM on the first time.

180
00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:26.324
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Did you reinstall t2 after
you switched to the other version?

181
00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:28.275
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah,
that was required for the first part.

182
00:10:28.275 --> 00:10:33.440
Yeah, so that is still not working.

183
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.490
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: What is the error?

184
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: There is
a whole lot of them.

185
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:44.228
Let me see if it works

186
00:10:44.228 --> 00:10:48.917
with the,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It is

187
00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:53.221
just update check field user, did that.

188
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:59.370
Saying I don't have permission for
making a directory of users.

189
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.013
Tessel?

190
00:11:03.013 --> 00:11:04.777
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let me take
a look at that in a second.

191
00:11:04.777 --> 00:11:09.754
Seems like a file provision issue.

192
00:11:12.166 --> 00:11:14.971
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Sure,
I will send crash reports.

193
00:11:16.149 --> 00:11:18.975
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I feel like when I
hit the y, that's not what I meant but

194
00:11:18.975 --> 00:11:22.604
I also wasn't looking at my screen and
had my fingers on the keyboard so

195
00:11:22.604 --> 00:11:24.130
I might have hit another.

196
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:26.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It knew what you really-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It knew what I

197
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:27.310
really meant.

198
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

199
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:28.420
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

200
00:11:30.609 --> 00:11:32.960
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: How's everyone
else's installation process going?

201
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:39.852
Everyone's a thumbs up
except our file directory.

202
00:11:39.852 --> 00:11:40.761
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Mine's crashed too.

203
00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:42.785
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I also crashed, yes.

204
00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:43.703
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,
we all crashed.

205
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.459
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Very cool.

206
00:11:45.459 --> 00:11:47.252
We're off to a wonderful start.

207
00:11:47.252 --> 00:11:51.950
Did anyone not crash?

208
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:56.896
I feel like consistent
crashing would be better than,

209
00:11:56.896 --> 00:11:59.806
[LAUGH] intermittent crashing.

210
00:12:02.106 --> 00:12:03.639
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Mine says update complete,
but

211
00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:05.920
it's still spinning on
the bottom after that.

212
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.718
So it says, firmware update complete.

213
00:12:09.718 --> 00:12:10.344
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Updated.

214
00:12:10.344 --> 00:12:11.760
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

215
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.630
I'm at one point gonna control C,
and see how it goes,

216
00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.880
cuz I have like worse case if
I fry one I have a second one.

217
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:21.266
The rest of you don't have that luxury, so

218
00:12:21.266 --> 00:12:26.454
I will go be the sacrificial lamb,
[LAUGH] to see how it goes first.

219
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Looks like it
reset all the names, too.

220
00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:50.100
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so just real
time followup, and so my CLI crashed.

221
00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:55.033
But if I run t2 update,
I'm running the latest firmware,

222
00:12:55.033 --> 00:12:57.213
so crash is a strong word.

223
00:12:57.213 --> 00:13:03.580
[LAUGH] I think I can confirm that
it looks fairly safe to control C.

224
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:06.970
You might have to do
the renaming process again.

225
00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.900
But it looks like I am on
the latest firmware version now.

226
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.660
Looks like that part was successful,
it's probably some clean up afterwards.

227
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.761
More importantly, putting together my
awesome name, which I now have to redo.

228
00:13:25.978 --> 00:13:30.900
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll do a t2 rename,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: RobotComputer.

229
00:13:33.191 --> 00:13:34.732
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

230
00:13:34.732 --> 00:13:38.453
So let's take a quick break while I check
on everyone and get everyone kind of like

231
00:13:38.453 --> 00:13:41.260
set up cuz there's no more
actual steps once this happened.

232
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:46.320
So I'm gonna stop for a second and
see what's going on and

233
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.280
then once we're all ready to rock and
roll, we'll pick back up again.
