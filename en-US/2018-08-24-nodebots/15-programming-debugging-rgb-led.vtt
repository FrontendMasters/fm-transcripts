00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
I'm back in my playground JS file.

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.820
I have some of the code from earlier
that I'm just gonna get rid of.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.030
Cuz I don't have any buttons anymore.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.430
Cool.

5
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.445
So, like most things in Johnny5,

6
00:00:13.445 --> 00:00:17.870
I guess our new motto is,
there's a class for that.

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.259
new five.Led.RGB.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

8
00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.497
and so because, remember,
when with the regular LED or

9
00:00:32.497 --> 00:00:37.320
the button, we said, okay,
here's the pin that it's in.

10
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.930
Now, we just did the wire together.

11
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.410
We know that there are more than one pin,
so we'll give it an object.

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.132
And we'll say red is in a5.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Green is in a6,

13
00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:57.471
and if these are not where yours are,

14
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:02.444
then you can just adjust
these values as appropriate.

15
00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:07.714
And then blue is in b5, all right?

16
00:01:07.714 --> 00:01:09.463
Super cool.

17
00:01:09.463 --> 00:01:14.131
And what I'm gonna do is,
I'm going to iterate over,

18
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.792
we'll start with red, green, and blue.

19
00:01:17.792 --> 00:01:20.706
That seems like a good set
of colors to iterate over.

20
00:01:20.706 --> 00:01:23.116
And we'll be able to just kind
of work through each of those so

21
00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:25.117
I'm going to make an array
of colors in the index.

22
00:01:25.117 --> 00:01:29.640
I'm gonna keep moving through the array
and like changing the color of the light.

23
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:37.644
So I'll say let index,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Equal 0 for starters,

24
00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:45.284
and we'll make a constant of colors.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Red,

25
00:01:45.284 --> 00:01:50.170
green, blue, all right.

26
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.940
And then what we'll do is,

27
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.610
there's a helpful method
called board.loop, and it's

28
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.700
not too much different than like a set
interval or something along those lines.

29
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.115
And we'll say every 500 milliseconds,

30
00:02:06.115 --> 00:02:09.813
what I would like you to
do is run this function.

31
00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:14.355
And in this function,
we're gonna say led.color, and

32
00:02:14.355 --> 00:02:17.194
we're gonna basically go ahead and

33
00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:22.310
use a modulo to figure out
which color we're gonna be on.

34
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.759
So what we'll do is we'll say colors,

35
00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:36.790
index + +modulo colors.length.

36
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.064
And what that will effectively do is,
so that will be the remainder of

37
00:02:41.064 --> 00:02:45.127
a constantly incrementing number
over the length of the colors.

38
00:02:45.127 --> 00:02:49.521
Which basically means it's gonna be 0,
1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2.

39
00:02:49.521 --> 00:02:54.042
Which will translate to red, green,

40
00:02:54.042 --> 00:02:58.289
blue, red, green, blue, cool.

41
00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:02.770
So what I am going to do is I am going
to switch to my timer real quick.

42
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.217
I am going to get the process
moving of deploying this code.

43
00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:14.679
I'll switch back to this so
you can still see it, as well.

44
00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:22.235
T2 run playground.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

45
00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.735
I'll go back to this code.

46
00:03:23.735 --> 00:03:28.713
And I soon enough will either see a red,
green, blue color changing LED,

47
00:03:28.713 --> 00:03:29.685
or I will not.

48
00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:36.872
And then I will,
in the second half of that probability,

49
00:03:36.872 --> 00:03:43.258
have to debug and
figure out what's going on.

50
00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:43.788
Perfect.

51
00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:44.868
Yep.

52
00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:48.817
That is definitely true.

53
00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:53.590
So, to repeat basically,
it's not just passing in red green blue,

54
00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.354
it is pins.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's right.

55
00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:02.561
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep.

56
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:06.894
It's why you pair program with
20 people at the same time.

57
00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:10.922
It's really effective.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Mob programming?

58
00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:11.796
Yeah, I like it.

59
00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:13.274
Very cool.

60
00:04:13.274 --> 00:04:20.254
It's one of those things, you said it and
I immediately looked down at my notes.

61
00:04:20.254 --> 00:04:26.427
I'm like, yep, that is it.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

62
00:04:26.427 --> 00:04:28.716
building our project.

63
00:04:28.716 --> 00:04:30.158
It is one of those things like,

64
00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.662
this is not a really long
time to deploy to the device.

65
00:04:32.662 --> 00:04:37.828
But when there's a color changing
RGB LED on the other end,

66
00:04:37.828 --> 00:04:41.666
it's like an insufferable amount of time.

67
00:04:41.666 --> 00:04:43.861
It's like what, 15, 30 seconds in reality?

68
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:49.057
But,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

69
00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:52.875
so console login.led is a lot of fun.

70
00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:54.320
You see it' as a very big object.

71
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.960
So my code works.

72
00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:02.030
Looking at my LED, I can see that
it's just flashing red on and off.

73
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.930
My suspicion right now is that

74
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.500
I've 50% chance of putting
the pin in the wrong way.

75
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.240
I'd have hit the wrong
side of that 50% chance.

76
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.710
So I'm gonna take out that console log and
I'm gonna redeploy the code.

77
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.690
And I'm gonna go over and basically
pull out the LED, flip it around, and

78
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.340
see if that solves my problem.

79
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.463
If it does, we'll all get to
see my LED flipping colors.

80
00:05:24.463 --> 00:05:27.483
I see other people with color
changing LEDs right now.

81
00:05:27.483 --> 00:05:31.583
So it makes me think that something
is right, and it is I who am wrong.

82
00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:36.517
Cool, so I'm gonna redeploy the code
without that console.log in it.

83
00:05:36.517 --> 00:05:40.201
So right now,
my LED is flashing red back and forth.

84
00:05:40.201 --> 00:05:43.592
Now, this makes me think there's an issue
with my ground is in the wrong place.

85
00:05:43.592 --> 00:05:47.654
So what I'm gonna do is just
pull it out and flip it around.

86
00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:53.322
As I said earlier, there's like a 50%
chance I put it in the wrong way.

87
00:05:53.322 --> 00:05:57.708
All right, bring it closer to me for
a second so I can see the pins.

88
00:05:57.708 --> 00:06:01.229
All right, so
I'm missing green in this case.

89
00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.979
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

90
00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.010
I'm gonna bring it close for one moment.

91
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.489
Looks like we just got a little bit

92
00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:31.583
of a wiring issue here because I've seen

93
00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:39.660
all the colors.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Perfect.

94
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.733
So, for a second, I had an issue
where I could see all the colors, but

95
00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:45.852
it wasn't consistent.

96
00:06:45.852 --> 00:06:49.510
So it's kinda like,
it's one of the problems with

97
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.400
effectively doing this from a few feet
away from the camera, which is basically

98
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.330
some of my resistors were touching,
which kind of crossed wires.

99
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.030
So just by spreading them out,
I was able to fix it.

100
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.320
So, in this case,
I'm going between red, green and blue.

101
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.210
Really, really cool.

102
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:09.908
Now, what I want you to
do is take a few minutes.

103
00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:12.518
Turns out, you'll notice that I just
typed in red, green and blue and

104
00:07:12.518 --> 00:07:14.344
it just like turns out red,
green and blue work.

105
00:07:14.344 --> 00:07:19.749
That's again,
some of the abstractions of Johnny5,

106
00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:22.854
working out really well for us.

107
00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:26.221
What I'd like you to do is,
any valid CSS color will work.

108
00:07:26.221 --> 00:07:31.120
So any of the CSS, like named colors
will work, also hex codes work.

109
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.610
So go ahead, take a few minutes,
and try out some different colors.

110
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:39.680
Cuz you're not just limited on a red
green blue LED to red green and blue.

111
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.440
But you can actually do
other colors as well.

112
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:50.603
So I would never rob you of
the opportunity to put in blanched almond.

113
00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:54.373
And some of them like aren't like
perfectly represented by the LED,

114
00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:57.760
like black is just off,
which is not really like super great.

115
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.040
But like try out some of
your favorite CSS colors.

116
00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.080
I think salmon is a color, right?

117
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.310
It's gonna be pretty boring.

118
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:08.620
Like it's not like a perfect
representation of all those colors, but

119
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.860
try out some different CSS colors and
take it for a spin.
