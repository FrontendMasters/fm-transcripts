00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.831
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool.

2
00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:04.208
Just two pieces of realtime follow up is,
so,

3
00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:08.460
when I was working before we
saw that it hung on the update.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.026
So we did a little research, by we I
mean Jackie and I did some research.

5
00:00:15.026 --> 00:00:18.388
And we found out basically it's we're
just trying to reapply the name,

6
00:00:18.388 --> 00:00:21.859
that's where it hung up, so the update
was successful so if you Ctrl+C and

7
00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.230
rename it everything is fine, it's good.

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.320
The other thing that we
learned from having 20 or

9
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.540
so Tessels in the same room is that it
might default to one that is not yours.

10
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.140
So mine is, that is not robot computer, we
could export and environment variable and

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.650
that will actually then point it
to the one we want to point to.

12
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.240
So you can actually just put in this in
your console and then you should point.

13
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.600
So instead of bulbasaur I'm gonna do.

14
00:00:53.952 --> 00:00:55.675
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: RobotComputer.

15
00:00:55.675 --> 00:01:00.519
Just one thing to keep in mind is that,
because I didn't put that in

16
00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.375
my batch profile or anything like that,
this is good for this tab.

17
00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:09.275
All right, if you do open another tab
then you would have to do it again or

18
00:01:09.275 --> 00:01:12.135
you can put in your best profile and
then it will be for

19
00:01:12.135 --> 00:01:16.230
every future tab that you open as well,
either way you should be good to go.
