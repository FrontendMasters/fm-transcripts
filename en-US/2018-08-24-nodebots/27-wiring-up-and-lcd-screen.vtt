&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There is one more
kind of fun component in there.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.840
I mean, there's a lot of fun components.

3
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.240
[LAUGH] But the next fun component that
we're gonna play with is the LCD screen.

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.210
I'll show that to you real quick here.

5
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.810
It is definitely one of our more
complicated wiring diagrams.

6
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.497
So what we're gonna do is spend a little
bit of time wiring it up because I think

7
00:00:23.497 --> 00:00:28.327
from my camera angle watching me wire it
up is probably not as helpful as actually

8
00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:31.380
looking at the diagram and
following that along.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.619
So we'll kind of get this one wired up.

10
00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:38.220
There's a lot of kind of moving parts in
place and then we'll take it for a spin.

11
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.760
This is definitely the boss level in
the wiring things up in this case.
