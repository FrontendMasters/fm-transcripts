00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.725
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, we're gonna
move on to our next experiment.

2
00:00:03.725 --> 00:00:08.474
Earlier we made n a single LED blink and
pulse and

3
00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:14.528
do a bunch of stuff and yes,
there were many colors in there,

4
00:00:14.528 --> 00:00:21.214
but what we didn't have was one LED
that could be all of the colors.

5
00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:26.110
So what we're gonna do now is
we have one RGB LED in there,

6
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.540
that we're gonna get a chance to use.

7
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.779
And you'll notice this one has a bunch
more pins, so I'm about to go over and

8
00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:35.381
put together this circuit.

9
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:39.374
So I wanna talk about it a little bit
first, is you'll notice that the ground is

10
00:00:39.374 --> 00:00:42.231
not on one of the ends,
it's kinda in the middle there.

11
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:48.022
And we'll kinda look real
quick at what each pin is.

12
00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:50.987
And then we'll have a few
wires going to the board.

13
00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:55.904
Before we get to wiring looks
like I picked some pretty

14
00:00:55.904 --> 00:00:58.643
odd pins on the Tessel there.

15
00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:02.556
I've got the like red and
the green going to port A, and

16
00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:05.033
I've got the blue going to port B.

17
00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:10.129
Does anyone have a suspicion or
hypothesis, if you will,

18
00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:14.967
on why I chose those pins?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

19
00:01:14.967 --> 00:01:16.707
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cuz they match the colors of

20
00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:18.224
the lights?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Are the wires,

21
00:01:18.224 --> 00:01:20.746
I chose the wires cuz they
match the colors of the lights.

22
00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:23.133
But why I chose like one pin on port B,

23
00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.738
and two on A?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's only PWM ports on

24
00:01:25.738 --> 00:01:27.205
each bar.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Exactly,

25
00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:32.249
exactly like if I had non PWA ports,
I could have the green all the way on or

26
00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:36.548
the green all the way off or
I could have the blue all the way on or

27
00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:41.562
the blue all the way off or the red all
the way on or the red all the way off.

28
00:01:41.562 --> 00:01:47.037
But if I can fade well,
then I can make a wider range of colors.

29
00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:48.651
So that's why I picked those ports.

30
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:53.237
I told you sometimes I just picked a port
cuz it was like easy and there and

31
00:01:53.237 --> 00:01:57.841
sometimes I had a very specific reason
why I did and promise to tell you.

32
00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:02.802
So that is the reason why I
picked this odd arrange of ports.

33
00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:06.159
Another thing I wanna look at is, so

34
00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.162
has an experimenterâ€™s guide for
the Johnny Five Inventors Kit.

35
00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:13.370
And there's a bunch of other
stuff you can do in there.

36
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.899
A lot of it has some overlap with what
we're doing today because there's so

37
00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:18.646
many components in the kit, right?

38
00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:23.054
But this is really helpful for
figuring out what pin is what.

39
00:02:23.054 --> 00:02:28.294
So we've kind of in the middle we
have got two kind of longer ones.

40
00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:34.742
And we could see that the second
one there is the ground.

41
00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:36.001
All right, cool.

42
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:41.848
So I'm gonna go over and
begin to put this together.

43
00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:47.937
And then, we're going to make LED
that can be a wide range of colors.

44
00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:54.212
So the first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna take my fun little RGB LED.

45
00:02:54.212 --> 00:03:02.426
I'm gonna place it in the board.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm

46
00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:06.220
actually bringing it closer to me for
a second, I might be off screen for

47
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.584
a moment here just so I can have
a better angle to get it in there.

48
00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:14.796
So you can give me one moment.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Four prongs

49
00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:20.309
are just a little bit harder than
two to do from a few feet away.

50
00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:24.913
Great, so
I've got that in place across four

51
00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:29.161
different of the rows on the bread board.

52
00:03:29.161 --> 00:03:32.545
Next thing I wanna do is I need for
the actual power ones,

53
00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.498
I'm gonna use some resistors.

54
00:03:34.498 --> 00:03:38.964
And resistors are non-polarized,
which means there's no right or

55
00:03:38.964 --> 00:03:41.044
wrong direction to put them in.

56
00:03:41.044 --> 00:03:47.993
But I'm gonna simply line them up
here as well, per the diagram.

57
00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:51.833
I'm gonna go over the channel,
like there is no reason they need to be

58
00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:56.685
necessarily like that, but I'm gonna,
it's easiest because they are pretty long.

59
00:03:56.685 --> 00:03:59.892
I'm going to close to make end for
one second.

60
00:03:59.892 --> 00:04:01.872
Cool, so

61
00:04:01.872 --> 00:04:07.880
we have,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Two

62
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.568
like this.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

63
00:04:14.568 --> 00:04:17.190
I'm going to be very
honest with you right now.

64
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.577
There is a 50% chance that I put
the RGB LED in the right way.

65
00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:28.648
[LAUGH] So one out of two cuz there
were four pins, and I have done this

66
00:04:28.648 --> 00:04:34.459
enough times to know that I have a 50%
of the time I get it right every time.

67
00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:38.291
So we'll find that out when
we get to writing the code.

68
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:40.051
We might have to come back and
flip it around.

69
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:48.129
And so I say that because while theres
a 50% chance that I got it right,

70
00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.378
there is likely also a 50% chance,

71
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.095
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That you got it right.

72
00:04:57.095 --> 00:05:00.559
And the nice part is, we'll do all
the hard wiring with the hard wire,

73
00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:04.644
I don't mean hardwire like that, I mean
difficult wiring, with the resistors.

74
00:05:04.644 --> 00:05:09.922
But if we do mess up the LED,
then we'll simply just flip it around.

75
00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:15.793
So luckily, if the 50% chance that
we have messed this up is true,

76
00:05:15.793 --> 00:05:18.132
it is very easy to rectify.

77
00:05:18.132 --> 00:05:23.255
We simply pull it out, turn it around,
place it in, problem solved.

78
00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:25.404
We'll be able to do that
without redeploying

79
00:05:25.404 --> 00:05:30.777
the code.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: This

80
00:05:30.777 --> 00:05:35.483
will likely be the second hardest
thing that we wire all day today.

81
00:05:35.483 --> 00:05:39.705
So, that's good news insofar
that everything else, except for

82
00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:44.538
one thing is easier, and the bad news is
that it does mean that one thing that

83
00:05:44.538 --> 00:05:47.473
we are gonna wire today
is going to be harder.

84
00:05:47.473 --> 00:05:51.501
[LAUGH] Cool, so
I've got those resistors going.

85
00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:54.522
And now I'm gonna take the first one.

86
00:05:54.522 --> 00:05:58.331
Again, anywhere along that channel,
it doesn't really matter where.

87
00:05:58.331 --> 00:06:03.396
Put in the red,
then we have the space where

88
00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:09.883
we are gonna have the ground and
I'll put in the green.

89
00:06:09.883 --> 00:06:13.063
And the schematic is in, there's
a directory called wiring diagrams.

90
00:06:13.063 --> 00:06:16.374
So you can also look at it on your
computer too if this angle's not working

91
00:06:16.374 --> 00:06:22.479
out great for you.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then blue.

92
00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:28.219
And,so as far as the PWM ports on
the Tessel, I need to go to PWM pins.

93
00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:33.946
I keep mixing up pins and
ports, I'm sorry.

94
00:06:33.946 --> 00:06:35.972
I need to go to PWM pins.

95
00:06:35.972 --> 00:06:38.753
Which ones I actually go to don't
necessarily matter because I'll be able to

96
00:06:38.753 --> 00:06:39.669
configure that in code.

97
00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:41.776
But I'm gonna take the red and

98
00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:48.471
put it in the A5.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm

99
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:52.708
gonna take the green and put it into A6.

100
00:06:52.708 --> 00:06:58.918
Easy way to tell A5 and A6 is that it goes
A0 to 7, so if you're not the last one,

101
00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:03.522
but the two that are second to last,
that's one way to tell.

102
00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:08.196
Or you can also just if you get real,
real close to

103
00:07:08.196 --> 00:07:13.455
the board you can also see
little numbers on the sides.

104
00:07:13.455 --> 00:07:18.719
We'll put the blue in one of the PWM
pins on the B-port and then for

105
00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:24.486
the black one, we have those resistors
kinda going over the gap there.

106
00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:27.063
But the ground,
we don't have like a little bridge so

107
00:07:27.063 --> 00:07:29.363
we'll go right on this
side of the bread board.

108
00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:35.444
And we will plug that in.

109
00:07:35.444 --> 00:07:38.846
Cool, I'm just gonna bring it close
to me again for a second to see.

110
00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:47.852
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Looks like I have got it.

111
00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:49.868
The nice part is if I do not have it,

112
00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:54.128
I will find out very quickly when I
deploy code to it and it doesn't work.

113
00:07:54.128 --> 00:07:58.358
[LAUGH] None of this is permanent,
if I have messed it up,

114
00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:00.342
I can just go in and fix it.

115
00:08:00.342 --> 00:08:04.349
Especially cuz I can write the code,
deploy it, and if I've messed up some

116
00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:08.625
wires, I can just move it around as it's
running, it's not really a big deal.

117
00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:10.990
So low risk if I've gotten it wrong,
and so

118
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.362
it's probably a good idea to go ahead and
validate it right?
