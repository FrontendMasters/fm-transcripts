00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So that is again,

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.190
the LED is the hello world
of working with hardware.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.066
And we've solved for
one direction at this point.

4
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:19.708
We've solved for
going from our code to control the board.

5
00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:23.037
What would be really
interesting at this point,

6
00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:27.921
is to actually let our actual hardware
tell our JavaScript something.

7
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:32.493
So we need a way for some kind of
interaction to go from the board and

8
00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:34.416
then do something in code.

9
00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:39.081
So we're gonna use a different component
at this point, we'll keep the LED where it

10
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:44.320
is for now, but we're gonna add another
component which is called the button.

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.300
And so go in and we'll actually just look
at what we're going to wire up next.

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.145
And so we're going to take
this button component and

13
00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.822
we're gonna add it to the board RAM.

14
00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:58.514
Now, before I was talking
a little bit about polarized and

15
00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:00.330
not polarized components.

16
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.842
The button itself is not a polarized
component, so which way it goes

17
00:01:03.842 --> 00:01:07.795
on the board, you'll see that none of
the pins are longer than another pin.

18
00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:08.940
We don't need to do that.

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.680
The other thing that we're gonna
do as we go over to the board is,

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.328
now I have multiple
things using the ground.

21
00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:19.213
So I will actually use that ground rail
along either the top or the bottom,

22
00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:21.545
whichever orientation works best for you.

23
00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:25.138
It doesn't really matter,
the red board is symmetrical.

24
00:01:25.138 --> 00:01:31.485
So the very first thing we're
gonna do is take that ground and

25
00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:39.582
move it to this ground rail right here.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

26
00:01:39.582 --> 00:01:43.791
I have a very small wire that I'm going to
use, but you can use a regular size wire,

27
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:47.210
but I just wanna make sure
that it's easy for you to see.

28
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.964
And I'm gonna go and kind of take
the ground of the LED and go in between,

29
00:02:10.537 --> 00:02:11.362
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

30
00:02:11.362 --> 00:02:13.980
that's should be in.

31
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.510
Cool, so I have a connection
in between that ground and

32
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.828
the actual LED where it was before.

33
00:02:19.828 --> 00:02:22.837
And that's effectively creating
the same circuit that I had before,

34
00:02:22.837 --> 00:02:24.834
which is stopping in
that middle ground rail.

35
00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:29.526
Next we're gonna take a button, and so
there are little fun caps for the buttons,

36
00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:32.387
but this is effectively
what a button looks like.

37
00:02:32.387 --> 00:02:36.742
And it has these kind of four
prongs along the bottom.

38
00:02:36.742 --> 00:02:40.633
On the top and the bottom, so
these two on the top are connected, and

39
00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:42.896
these two on the bottom are connected.

40
00:02:42.896 --> 00:02:45.620
So it's not really four prongs, it's two.

41
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.550
And it doesn't matter, what we're gonna do
is we're actually gonna put it over that

42
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.021
channel in the middle of your breadboard.

43
00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:59.928
So kinda place it in like that.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

44
00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:05.218
one thing you wanna make sure is that you
didn't actually bend any of the pins.

45
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.940
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll place that in.

46
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.660
And so now, because it's going over
the channel you could technically,

47
00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.600
it's connected to both sides
of the channel in this case.

48
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.580
But we're gonna keep everything
on the one side that we have.

49
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.940
And the first thing we'll do is we'll
kind of connect it to ground again,

50
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.900
based on the diagram.

51
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.826
Let's actually grab a slightly smaller

52
00:03:32.826 --> 00:03:39.651
one.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

53
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:41.850
it's very important to
look very closely at it.

54
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.584
It's not necessarily the very
edge of the physical button, but

55
00:03:44.584 --> 00:03:45.960
where the pin actually goes in.

56
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.700
Cool, and I am off by one so
I'm just gonna move my button over but

57
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.215
it's mostly because I'm
doing this at an interesting

58
00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:01.980
angle.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Were you trying to

59
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.880
line up the pins with the light?
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I might hardwire the pins

60
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.430
with this ground wire.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

61
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.223
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

62
00:04:08.223 --> 00:04:12.646
So we look at the diagram, you can see
that the kinda pins are slightly towards

63
00:04:12.646 --> 00:04:20.530
the middle and then,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll go,

64
00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.050
I'm not going to use black,
black is not a great color for that.

65
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.332
We'll actually take yellow,
seems like a good color.

66
00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.768
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll go from there, and

67
00:04:38.768 --> 00:04:39.960
that is going.

68
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.030
So I can leave the LED and the A5 for it,

69
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.078
the diagram that we have
is kinda back to A0.

70
00:04:47.078 --> 00:04:50.360
It doesn't really matter, our adjust
code will have to reflect what it is.

71
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.934
I'm going to match the diagram,
just for everyone's sanity, but

72
00:04:54.934 --> 00:04:58.797
you can choose to leave this,
it's gonna go back to A0.

73
00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:00.137
And then the button,

74
00:05:00.137 --> 00:05:04.883
there's gonna be another gap in between,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Along

75
00:05:04.883 --> 00:05:09.455
those lines.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Right, so

76
00:05:09.455 --> 00:05:13.640
we should match the diagram
that we have in that directory.
