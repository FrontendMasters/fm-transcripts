00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.376
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Gonna move
on to our next experiment.

2
00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.502
So there's a bunch of really interesting
sensors for the outside world, right?

3
00:00:08.502 --> 00:00:13.199
Like right now, like we have like I'm
changing a color, I am pressing a button,

4
00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:14.942
I am executing code, right?

5
00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:18.273
But in your kit, there's a whole
bunch of really interesting sensors.

6
00:00:18.273 --> 00:00:22.305
There's a soil moisture sensor,
unfortunately in the room right now we do

7
00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:26.657
not have, like everyone has Johnny-Five
Inventorâ€™s Kit what we did not get for

8
00:00:26.657 --> 00:00:28.193
all of you is a potted plant.

9
00:00:28.193 --> 00:00:35.126
[LAUGH] So we'll actually play with,
there is a weather sensor.

10
00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:36.811
It did,
basically gets a few different things.

11
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:39.363
It will get the temperature in Celsius and
Fahrenheit.

12
00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:44.425
The relative humidity and
the barometric pressure.

13
00:00:44.425 --> 00:00:47.543
Kind of record all of
those events in real time.

14
00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:50.518
First, I'll show you kind of
what we're gonna wire up and

15
00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:54.234
then we'll switch over to the table,
and we'll kind of get it in place.

16
00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:58.674
This is the first one that we're gonna
use that involves that I2C, which is just

17
00:00:58.674 --> 00:01:02.552
the way of taking a complicated
component and making it a lot simpler.

18
00:01:02.552 --> 00:01:09.312
So what I'm able to do if I go over to
the bme280, it's a very fancy name.

19
00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:12.042
You don't need to now how
ITC works to have fun.

20
00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:16.627
Just know that for getting, it basically
simplifies the fact that we would

21
00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:20.354
like to get all these different
data points from our sensor.

22
00:01:20.354 --> 00:01:22.487
And we'd like to do it with
as STU wires as possible.

23
00:01:22.487 --> 00:01:25.952
[LAUGH] So
this is basically a way to simplify that.

24
00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:31.628
So when we go over, the one thing I wanna
point out cuz I think it is definitely

25
00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:36.861
very, the thing you might not notice
is if you look at the order of wires

26
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:42.293
on the breadboard, you can see we've
got the ground and then the power.

27
00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:45.250
And then we've got two
going to the GPIO ports.

28
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.119
You'll note it is green and then blue,
but if you look over at the Tessel,

29
00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.632
it's black, red, blue, and then green.

30
00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:58.783
So it is one of those very very subtle
things that when you wire it up and

31
00:01:58.783 --> 00:02:03.020
it doesn't work, that should be
the very first thing that you check.

32
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.910
Cuz even us saying it,

33
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.983
it's not necessarily like a given
that you won't just mix those two up.

34
00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:12.563
If you mix them both up on both ends,

35
00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:15.802
actually it works because the color
of the wire doesn't mean anything.

36
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.363
But if you kinda go in the same
order on both sides it won't work.

37
00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:21.995
So it's just something I want to
like draw your attention to, and

38
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:25.114
we'll actually get this wired up,
all right, great.

39
00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:28.205
Now we're going to wire up this component.

40
00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:30.471
Luckily, it's not terribly difficult.

41
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:34.604
We'll put this, I'm gonna just kinda
span that channel in the middle.

42
00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:37.833
We're only using components on one side.

43
00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:41.533
So, first, I will go ahead, and
I will take the ground wire.

44
00:02:46.593 --> 00:02:47.383
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will go and

45
00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:52.982
connect that
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: To

46
00:02:52.982 --> 00:02:57.527
the ground, take some power.

47
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:10.399
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Connected to the power
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Now,

48
00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:15.175
the moment we've all been waiting for,
I'll start with the green.

49
00:03:20.397 --> 00:03:21.504
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Which is going from the,

50
00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:23.824
it's effectively the third
on our bread board, but

51
00:03:23.824 --> 00:03:25.573
it's gonna go to fourth on the Tessel.

52
00:03:25.573 --> 00:03:29.738
Even though I warned
you not to mix them up,

53
00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:35.062
there's still a chance that
I'm going to mix them up,

54
00:03:35.062 --> 00:03:41.570
so it's exciting.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

55
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.480
we'll plug in the,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Blue

56
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.862
one.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

57
00:03:50.862 --> 00:03:57.588
on the Tessle side I've
got black/red green/blue.

58
00:03:57.588 --> 00:04:01.089
I'm sorry, and the bread board side
I've got black/red, green/blue.

59
00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:07.282
On the Tessle side I have, it looks
like I'm actually off by one port.

60
00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:11.776
So which it would just be
slightly different in that case,

61
00:04:11.776 --> 00:04:14.168
black,red, blue and green.

62
00:04:14.168 --> 00:04:18.830
So I should be good, famous last words.
