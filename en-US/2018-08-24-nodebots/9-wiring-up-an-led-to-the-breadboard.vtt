00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.340
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Here, we have
the breadboard and we've got our LED.

2
00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.650
And we're gonna grab any two jumper wires,
which are these small wires.

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.240
I have a few different ones that
might look different than yours.

4
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.700
Mostly, I have some big ones and

5
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.180
some small ones because as we get
to the more complicated circuits,

6
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.570
if I have a giant wire,
it's gonna be very hard for you to see.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.620
So I also have some smaller wires as well.

8
00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.348
So the colors don't necessarily matter,
but for your own sanity,

9
00:00:29.348 --> 00:00:35.277
I usually use black or the darkest
color that I can find very quickly for

10
00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:40.804
like a ground wire and something bright,
like a red preferably,

11
00:00:40.804 --> 00:00:47.070
or in this case orange, for the ones
that actually have power going to it.

12
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.830
The colors don't actually affect
the copper that is inside that wire.

13
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.790
But it is usually easier
to keep track of that way.

14
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.840
So what I will do is I will take.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Into

15
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.355
this very first port,
like in the diagram earlier.

16
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:07.418
Which that diagram is in the repo, in
that folder, if you need to refer to it.

17
00:01:07.418 --> 00:01:10.213
Especially as we get to some of
the more complicated circuits.

18
00:01:10.213 --> 00:01:15.421
And I'm gonna move that over to pin five.

19
00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:21.973
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool and then I'm going

20
00:01:21.973 --> 00:01:27.301
to take the second one,
put it in the two row.

21
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:34.451
And I'm gonna put that to the ground.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Finally,

22
00:01:34.451 --> 00:01:39.246
I'm gonna take my LED,
I'm gonna put it into the breadboard

23
00:01:39.246 --> 00:01:44.040
with the long end in that very first,
row and column is hard,

24
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.381
depending on how you rotate
the breadboard, I guess.

25
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:53.661
But in the one and I'll take
the short end and I'll put it in two.

26
00:02:00.614 --> 00:02:01.142
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

27
00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:05.110
that should be my first
circuit with the breadboard.
