00:00:00.073 --> 00:00:03.267
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So we have it wired up.

2
00:00:03.267 --> 00:00:05.481
What we're gonna do next,
is just clear out some of our previous

3
00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:09.154
code.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

4
00:00:09.154 --> 00:00:11.186
we'll get rid of everything
in board.on('ready',

5
00:00:11.186 --> 00:00:18.485
cuz we're gonna change a bunch of stuff.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I

6
00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:24.830
don't need these either, or superagent.

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.341
So very, very, very back to basics like
we were at the beginning of this course.

8
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:36.939
Cool, and so what we'll do is we'll

9
00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:45.184
say const door = new five.Switch.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

10
00:00:45.184 --> 00:00:49.412
the pin is a2,
unless I made a terrible mistake wiring up

11
00:00:49.412 --> 00:00:54.829
before.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

12
00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:55.959
leave this when we have to invert.

13
00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.689
If it's the wrong one,
we'll actually switch it in a second.

14
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.750
Cool, and it's very much like the button.

15
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.740
With button,
it was either pressed or released.

16
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.582
This is a switch,

17
00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:12.490
so we'll say the switch basically on
a certain level is either open or closed.

18
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.176
And that is not because
this is a door switch,

19
00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:18.016
it is just the circuit is either open or
closed.

20
00:01:18.016 --> 00:01:24.453
It just happens to be that this is a door,
which is arguably either open or

21
00:01:24.453 --> 00:01:29.257
closed in this case.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: door.on('open') and

22
00:01:29.257 --> 00:01:36.284
we will just console.log for now.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Say

23
00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:39.057
console.log('open').

24
00:01:43.913 --> 00:01:49.150
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: door.on('close'.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's

25
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.643
console.log('close').

26
00:01:51.643 --> 00:01:54.155
Cool, I'm gonna deploy that, and
I'll switch back over to this,

27
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.623
in case you're reading along with me.

28
00:02:04.947 --> 00:02:06.828
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool,

29
00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:11.423
give that a second or
two, so you all catch up.

30
00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:13.445
So very, very similar to about a.

31
00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:17.879
This is a very simple component, even
though the applications are more fun than

32
00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.485
a button.

33
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.551
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm feeling
ready to check in on my code.

34
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.828
So it is currently closed,

35
00:02:45.828 --> 00:02:50.471
which makes sense.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I can't

36
00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:54.500
show both the door switch and
the code at the same time, so believe me.

37
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.097
For those of you not in the room,
I am about to reach over and

38
00:02:58.097 --> 00:03:04.274
separate the two components.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Separate them,

39
00:03:04.274 --> 00:03:06.536
I knocked into it first,
that's why you saw all that data.

40
00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:11.682
They are separated.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Reaching is

41
00:03:11.682 --> 00:03:18.929
not super helpful here, cool.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We can open,

42
00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:19.700
we can close.

43
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.482
Now, there is a chance we wanna
either throttle that or bounce it.

44
00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:25.254
Generally speaking, if you are not
reaching over a table in front of a bunch

45
00:03:25.254 --> 00:03:27.641
of people, it is a little bit more
consistent on open and close.

46
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.573
But as I keep bumping it and
the wires move, we see both.

47
00:03:30.573 --> 00:03:35.525
Well, we can see everything is open and
we can see where everything is closed,

48
00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:37.110
and that is pretty cool.
