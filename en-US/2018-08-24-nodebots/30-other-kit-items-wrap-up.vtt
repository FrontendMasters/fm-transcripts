00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.770
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, before we go, I just
wanna spend a little bit of time to talk

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.860
about the pieces that we didn't
get a chance to use today.

3
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.560
So, this piece I'm holding right here is a
motor controller which by itself doesn't,

4
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.150
I mean it controls motors, but

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.210
that's only really interesting if
you have motors, which you do.

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.451
And so
there's a bunch of really cool things.

7
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:25.939
This workshop was slightly geared to
my interests with a lot of this stuff,

8
00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.000
which is integrating a whole bunch
of web technologies together and

9
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.367
controlling it in the physical world.

10
00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:37.338
But there's a whole other edge
of this community that is

11
00:00:37.338 --> 00:00:42.535
kind of interested in actually
building robots, right?

12
00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:47.386
Turning some wheels, moving a claw,
stuff along those lines.

13
00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:51.002
JSConf US, which has been not
happening for the last few years but

14
00:00:51.002 --> 00:00:56.290
I believe it's happening again this year,
they had, it was a three day conference.

15
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.660
And what they did was
the first day was conference,

16
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.960
the second day was like a play day and
then the third day was conference again.

17
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.570
And you got to see all the interesting
things people are doing on the robot side.

18
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.178
So there was no bots,
like turning some wheels,

19
00:01:11.178 --> 00:01:14.618
moving some claws,
stuff along those lines.

20
00:01:14.618 --> 00:01:18.583
But there was also node boats, right?

21
00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:22.483
Which was basically boats
controlled by JavaScript, so

22
00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:28.010
take all the fun electric stuff
we've been doing and then add water.

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.070
And then finally, just to kind of one up,

24
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.724
there's node copters right, but
finally there's also node rockets.

25
00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:40.490
Which were JavaScript powered rockets.

26
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.200
There's also just a lot of fun stuff that
you can do along those lines as well.

27
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.030
There's other interesting things.

28
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.460
One of my friends, Cass Perch,
she has clothing where she's sewn in LEDs.

29
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.450
And there was one where based
on the sentiment analysis

30
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.290
of a tweet that you would send her,
her clothes would change different colors.

31
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.440
My friend Susan has meow shoes.

32
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.280
That's in our book,

33
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.470
Make a JavaScript Robotics which
show you how to make those as well.

34
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.960
So there's lots of other
interesting applications.

35
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.053
It's like, this has definitely been bent
to my interest which is like, playing

36
00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:19.746
around the APIs, sending data out into
the data in and stuff along those lines.

37
00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:23.210
But between pulling some of this
hardware stuff into clothing,

38
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.790
launching it into the sky,
having it roll around your office.

39
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.360
There's a lot of really,

40
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.700
really interesting stuff you can
do along those lines as well.

41
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.200
So now, again, the major part here
is seeing the flip side, right?

42
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.268
That we can hook in to third party
APIs and have stuff happen, right?

43
00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:45.599
There are real-time APIs, but you could
also have a border loop that checks

44
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.876
the weather and flashes an LED red if
it's about to thunderstorm, right?

45
00:02:49.876 --> 00:02:54.429
There's lots of different combinations
when you think about all the APIs out

46
00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:59.050
there, and all the kind of crazy things
that you could do as you start to combine

47
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.820
all of these things, right?

48
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.785
And so, my job today was to kind
of show you some of the different

49
00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:10.020
pieces individually in
small digestible chunks.

50
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.250
But hopefully if I've done my job well,
is that over the next days, weeks,

51
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.580
months, is that you will start thinking
about interesting combinations of things,

52
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.754
realize that you have
this suite of components.

53
00:03:22.754 --> 00:03:24.781
You have all of the APIs on the Internet.

54
00:03:24.781 --> 00:03:28.653
The ability to real time push information,
real time pull information.

55
00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:29.606
Talk to web servers.

56
00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.334
Pull information from web servers.

57
00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:32.049
Send emails.

58
00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.060
You can send text messages
with the Twilio API.

59
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.820
All the APIs that are out there
give you a whole bunch of

60
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.570
interesting combinations where you
can take the real physical world and

61
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.550
the Internet world and combine them
in really, really interesting ways.

62
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.405
So I hope this has been,
I had a lot of fun.

63
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.115
I hope this has been fun for you as well.

64
00:03:53.115 --> 00:03:57.679
And I hope that, my real hope is gonna
come over the next few days, weeks, and

65
00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:02.188
months as you start to create really
interesting things and send them to me.

66
00:04:02.188 --> 00:04:08.351
Cool, thank you so much.

67
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:09.727
