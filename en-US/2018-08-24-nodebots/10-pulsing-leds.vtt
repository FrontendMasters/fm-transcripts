00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.030
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
we've rewired the board.

2
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.220
It's no longer going to a zero.

3
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.170
We've made it go to a five instead.

4
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.357
So what we need to do next is
actually just do a very quick

5
00:00:11.357 --> 00:00:13.278
adjustment to our code.

6
00:00:13.278 --> 00:00:20.262
In the IntelliJ 5 that we are looking for
new five.Led(a5).

7
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.188
I'll go back over to my code and

8
00:00:25.188 --> 00:00:29.383
I'll do a t2 run playground.js.

9
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:35.350
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll go ahead and
deploy that code.

10
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.710
So now we see that the led is pulsing.

11
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.315
Before it wasn't doing
anything cuz the code crashed,

12
00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:46.210
cuz we weren't on a PWM port.

13
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.000
Now we are and so we can actually fade
between fully off and fully on, right?

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.330
So in some cases, like for
very general things, for

15
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.470
the blinking that is a very
standard the thing to do.

16
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.130
So, it doesn't really matter what
port I plugged it into, but for

17
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.250
stuff like pulsing I need to make sure
that I am using one of the ports, sorry,

18
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.030
pins that supports the pulsing.

19
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.615
And with that,
we are going to kill this process

20
00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:20.190
cuz while the pulsing is very validating,
we get the point.
