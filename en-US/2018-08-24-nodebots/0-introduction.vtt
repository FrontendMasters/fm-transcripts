00:00:03.077 --> 00:00:04.580
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hello,
my name is Steve, and

2
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.900
we're gonna play with some hardware today,
it's gonna be fun.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.420
This is Introduction to Nodebots.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.970
I guess we should answer the obvious
question is is, what are Nodebots?

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.450
Unfortunately, the answer is
not particularly illuminating.

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.950
It's robots with node.js.

7
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.770
It's a lot more catchy
than JavaScript bots, and

8
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.860
it rolls off the tongue a lot better.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.180
So the kit that we're gonna be using
is the Johnny-Five Inventor's Kit.

10
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.450
And we'll talk about what
Johnny-Five is in a second.

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.376
But this is kind of the spread.

12
00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:37.085
It's in a nice, little, neat box, but

13
00:00:37.085 --> 00:00:42.519
if you were to spread it out across the
table, this is roughly what it looks like.

14
00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.217
And the kind of important
piece here is the actual,

15
00:00:46.217 --> 00:00:49.571
[INAUDIBLE] you have what
is called a Tessel 2.

16
00:00:49.571 --> 00:00:52.970
Which is a open source piece of
hardware that runs JavaScript natively.

17
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.900
Which is really cool, cuz it means
that we can program using JavaScript.

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.230
That's okay, that's fine, right?

19
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.710
If we really wanted to,
we could learn some other language.

20
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.460
I choose not to learn other languages.

21
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.060
I choose to [LAUGH] exclusively
just write JavaScript.

22
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.770
But the major thing that I'm
going to keep kind of hitting on

23
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.125
throughout the day is what's really
cool about programming hardware with

24
00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:22.250
JavaScript is not just I get to use my
favorite my language which is nice.

25
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.534
But that we're still using the same
technologies that we used to create web

26
00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:31.575
servers and browser-based experiences, and
that we can bring all of those together.

27
00:01:31.575 --> 00:01:33.860
We can use any library on NPM.

28
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.080
We can use the browser and any of
the APIs on the browser, and mix and

29
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.520
match all those things together.

30
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.170
And I think that's what makes working with
hardware with JavaScript really exciting.

31
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.260
So that Tessel 2 that you have,
we're gonna set it up in a second.

32
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.680
First, I kinda wanna take just
a little tour of what it is.

33
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.190
So this is what it looks like,
you have one in front of you so

34
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.310
this is I guess helpful to see on
the screen, but this is the board itself.

35
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.988
It's actually really cool.

36
00:02:00.988 --> 00:02:06.301
So it's got two USB ports, an Ethernet
port, it's actually got built in WiFi and

37
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:10.848
you can actually deploy code onto
the board and then watch it run that.

38
00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:14.854
Sometimes if you've used Arduinos in the
past with JavaScript, a lot of times you

39
00:02:14.854 --> 00:02:18.410
actually still have to have them
connected to the computer, all right?

40
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.640
And you have to replace the firmware and
all this fun stuff.

41
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.370
With the Tessla 2,
it is JavaScript out of the box.

42
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.638
You can actually deploy the code
to run on the device itself.

43
00:02:27.638 --> 00:02:29.590
That built-in WiFi is really cool.

44
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.250
You can actually program it over WiFi,

45
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.100
you don't necessarily need
to plug into a computer.

46
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.930
We're gonna leave ours plugged into
our computer, cuz who needs to invite

47
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.158
the chaos of 20 devices programed
over WiFi in a room together?

48
00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:45.374
So we're gonna use USB.

49
00:02:45.374 --> 00:02:49.820
But if you're using it somewhere in your
home, you could install it somewhere and

50
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.893
still deploy code to it over the WiFi.

51
00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:55.438
It can run a web server that you
can connect to that we're gonna do

52
00:02:55.438 --> 00:02:56.233
later today.

53
00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.130
So a lot of really kind
of cool things involved.

54
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.290
So tech specs, if you care,
it's not something that we need to know,

55
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.072
but just fun trivia, is that there is
64MB of RAM, 32MB of flash storage.

56
00:03:09.072 --> 00:03:14.124
WiFi, like I mentioned,
the USB ports that you can see on there.

57
00:03:14.124 --> 00:03:18.109
It can actually work as a WiFi router,
if you really wanted it to, and

58
00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.600
JavaScript is a first class citizen on it.

59
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.660
So, as I mentioned,
you can program it USB or WiFi.

60
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.890
We're gonna use USB,
because who needs to invite that?

61
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.750
Cool, so
this is kind of some other views of it.

62
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.300
What's really kinda interesting for

63
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.880
our purposes is on the side
there are a bunch of GPIO ports.

64
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.060
What does GPIO stand for?

65
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.020
It stands for
General Purpose Input Output,

66
00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.440
which I think I have on another slide.

67
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.520
But let's actually kind
of look at what we have.

68
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.420
So we have a A port and a B port.

69
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.800
They are slightly different.

70
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.365
Not all the ports are the same.

71
00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:01.403
If you're just using general,
like I need to use something very simple,

72
00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:02.650
you can use any of them.

73
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.632
But some of them have certain
capabilities that others don't.

74
00:04:06.632 --> 00:04:09.370
The first one on each side is ground, and

75
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.900
the second one is some power that we can
use if we need to power a given component.

76
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.170
The rest are actually, yep, is just
input and output, we have 16 ports.

77
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.580
Starts with B0 and A0,
because programming, we start with 0.

78
00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.533
It makes sense.

79
00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:28.991
There's actually additional
5 volts of power on the top,

80
00:04:28.991 --> 00:04:30.961
kind of by that USB stack.

81
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:34.695
In the way we power it as well as
extra ground, stuff along those lines.

82
00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:36.432
We're not gonna use any of those.

83
00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:38.159
The WiFi is at the bottom.

84
00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.049
So on and so forth.

85
00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:42.550
There's actually from built-in LEDs that
we'll actually get started with, and

86
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.910
a few things along those lines.

87
00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.883
But we're actually gonna kind of
wire together our own components for

88
00:04:47.883 --> 00:04:49.240
most of this workshop.

89
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.631
So yep, GPIO,
I'll say it a bunch of times,

90
00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:57.917
there will not be a quiz on it later,
general purpose input/output.

91
00:04:57.917 --> 00:05:01.535
All 16 pins, as I said earlier,
can be used for

92
00:05:01.535 --> 00:05:05.170
GPIO, but
some pins do stuff other pins don't.

93
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.396
If this slide stresses you out,
do not worry about it.

94
00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:13.339
You actually don't need to know any of
this, except for that third bullet point.

95
00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:15.577
And when you need to know it,
we'll get to it.

96
00:05:15.577 --> 00:05:16.989
This is just general.

97
00:05:16.989 --> 00:05:20.265
If you're curious what all the special
things that these ports can do are,

98
00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:22.200
here's a slide that you
can refer to later.

99
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.070
And here it is lined up to
the actual board itself.

100
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.570
So we're gonna be using the PWM ports
at one point, as well as the I2C.

101
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.180
But all the other fun stuff is
just there for general knowledge.

102
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.520
But also, if at one point you
see me wiring something up,

103
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.800
you're like, why did he pick that port?

104
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.960
It's one of two answers.

105
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.540
One is, it's a GPIO port, and
I could have picked any of them, or two,

106
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.094
it is one of the ones that only
supports a certainly protocol, right?

107
00:05:51.094 --> 00:05:53.760
And we kinda have called that out.

108
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.705
For PWM, that's just a way to
actually send some amount of data,

109
00:05:57.705 --> 00:06:02.657
anything that can vary between one and
zero, cuz think about digital, zeroes and

110
00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:03.982
ones is really easy.

111
00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:06.624
Anywhere between zero and
one, kind of hard.

112
00:06:06.624 --> 00:06:10.583
So the PWM ports will actually
support that, and the I2C is for

113
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.286
some of our more complicated components.

114
00:06:13.286 --> 00:06:18.177
And so I'll be plugging in to ports either
zero or one for that, and ports five or

115
00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:21.758
six for things when I need
something between zero and one.
