1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.560
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I've left the LED,
we're gonna use it a little bit later.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.941
But right now we have just this button,
we wanna kinda get it working.

3
00:00:08.803 --> 00:00:12.673
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, so,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Go back over to my

4
00:00:12.673 --> 00:00:14.335
code in that playground.js.

5
00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:20.180
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And
you can leave that code.

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.720
It's not gonna work anymore
if you moved it back, so

7
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.310
I'm actually gonna comment it out for
a moment.

8
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.671
And what I really want to do first
is I want to get the button working.

9
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:37.285
So what I'll do is I'll

10
00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:41.898
say const button is a new

11
00:00:41.898 --> 00:00:46.520
Johnny five.Button.

12
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.964
Cool, and that is plugged into the a2 pin.

13
00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:57.538
It's worth looking at your board,
the button is a GPIO,

14
00:00:57.538 --> 00:01:01.200
it's doesn't matter which
one you've plugged it into.

15
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.770
So if you look at your board,
no, I have mine in the a3

16
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.120
pin, just change this code to a3.

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.590
Or else move it to the a2 pin,
either one is fine.

18
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.400
This is not one of
the ones where it's like,

19
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.880
it needs to be in this certain place.

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.660
Cool, and then this is a pull up button.

21
00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:27.548
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Basically that will
use one of the kinda built in resistors

22
00:01:27.548 --> 00:01:28.110
in the board.

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.810
All right, so we have this button.

24
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.730
And a button has some events, right?

25
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.310
And again, it is very similar.

26
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.560
You can kinda take some of
your JavaScript knowledge and

27
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.270
apply it, is that it has different
events that can happen to a button.

28
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.693
Would anyone like to venture a guess of
some of the events that could happen to

29
00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:48.322
a button.

30
00:01:48.322 --> 00:01:50.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Press.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You could press it,

31
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.761
right.

32
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.111
We are actually going to look at the docs.

33
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:55.368
I think it's kind of interesting.

34
00:01:55.368 --> 00:01:59.291
The Johnny Five docs are really great and
I kind of want to take a moment.

35
00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:01.800
There is both API and examples.

36
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.485
We are going to look at the API but if you
go to the examples, which really kinda

37
00:02:05.485 --> 00:02:09.057
great is, it'll actually show you how
to wire up a bunch of stuff as well and

38
00:02:09.057 --> 00:02:10.980
some code to execute it.

39
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.960
We're gonna to to the API though.

40
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.470
And we're gonna go take
a look at a button.

41
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.580
And we see the isPullup boolean.

42
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.650
And we can kinda go ahead and
we can see some of the events.

43
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.710
So, as someone said just a second ago,
is yes,

44
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.390
events can happen on buttons and
it's the ones that you think.

45
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.220
They can be pressed, they can also
be released, and they can be held.

46
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.670
And the aliases for press and
release are down and up as well, right?

47
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.790
So when the button is down, the button
is up, those both do the same thing.

48
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.970
If one set of those made more sense
to your brain than the other,

49
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.040
do the one that made more sense for you.

50
00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.791
So what I'll do is I'll say

51
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.963
button.on('press').

52
00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:14.848
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll just
say console.log('pressed').

53
00:03:14.848 --> 00:03:19.164
And we'll say on release,

54
00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:23.668
console.log release, and

55
00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:27.150
you can also do hold.

56
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.360
You can do down or up,
whichever one that's kinda make you happy.

57
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.457
So I'm gonna go, and I'm gonna go back and
run my playground code.

58
00:03:43.704 --> 00:03:47.610
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: It's gonna
deploy to my device, cool.

59
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.860
I'm going to keep this on
the terminal right now but

60
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.050
I'm going to press the button.

61
00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.097
As I press it down, we see pressed,
as I release it, we see release.

62
00:04:00.097 --> 00:04:04.570
Press it, it's pressed,
I release it, I see release.

63
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.850
Right, so this is the inverted flow
of control that we had before.

64
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.050
Previously we said hey, LED,
I want you to blink, or

65
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.660
I want you to pulse, or
I want you to turn on or off.

66
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.580
And we were controlling
hardware with code.

67
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.630
Now, the code is actually, or

68
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.870
the hardware is actually firing events
that we can react to with code.

69
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.750
So it's a way for the outside physical
world to now interact with JavaScript.

70
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.750
And kind of just to tease where we're
going with this today, it's kind of

71
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.670
interesting that, again, think about
the things that we can do with JavaScript.

72
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.250
We can fire up web servers.

73
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.180
We can trigger API calls.

74
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.607
We can do all sorts of things.

75
00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:42.624
We can work with all of the Internet,
as it's known, right?

76
00:04:42.624 --> 00:04:44.501
Now, from the physical world.

77
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:48.341
And for me, that's the part where
this gets really exciting, right?

78
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:50.391
Okay, we can do all sorts of stuff.

79
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:51.732
There's some fun stuff in this kit.

80
00:04:51.732 --> 00:04:54.990
There's a door sensor that
whenever the two things separate,

81
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.411
that can trigger an event.

82
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:59.356
So now we can figure out how to
integrate that with other things.

83
00:04:59.356 --> 00:05:01.231
So now we have the button in place.
