&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Probably the first
question that you might be asking is,

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.080
why is it called a breadboard?

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.760
And the answer to that question,

4
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.580
in my family we have these
thing called friendly facts,

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.544
which is when someone presents something
in a fact, but it's probably true.

6
00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:17.771
Is that earlier when people were
working on building circuits,

7
00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.594
you had all of these different components
that you were wiring together, so

8
00:00:21.594 --> 00:00:23.824
you used a breadboard for
putting bread on.

9
00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:28.780
And you could staple or
pin down all the different components.

10
00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.580
These days you would
not put bread on this.

11
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.510
It is very small.

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.960
And not really useful for something.

13
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.276
Maybe you could possibly put a cracker
on it, but let's not do that.

14
00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:43.720
So a breadboard is basically a way,
when you're prototyping a circuit,

15
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.480
to kinda put in all of
your different components.

16
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.540
And it might stress you out a little bit,
but

17
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.364
I promise you there is a logic to all
of these at the holes on the board.

18
00:00:54.364 --> 00:00:55.314
So let's talk about it.

19
00:00:55.314 --> 00:00:59.810
So if you think about it, there's really
four sections to this breadboard.

20
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.040
There's those top two rows which
are very similar to the bottom two rows.

21
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.530
And then there's a kind of middle set of
five with a little channel in the middle.

22
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.770
So you could almost cut
that breadboard in half.

23
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.330
And the top half is effectively
a mirror image of the bottom half.

24
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.591
So we've cut the problem
area down in half already.

25
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:27.106
Let's talk about the very top,
the plus and minus.

26
00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:31.418
So along the top is all of
these are connected, right?

27
00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:37.008
So if you bring a power wire and you put
it into any of those holes along the top,

28
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:39.860
that is shared across that entire row.

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.220
Similarly, the other channel
is also connected, right?

30
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.490
So if you put two wires in any two
holes on that row, they are connected.

31
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.400
So that's the way to take your one,
you have,

32
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.710
I think, effectively three ground
ports on the Tessel, right?

33
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.390
Different devices,
you might have more or less.

34
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.870
But it's a way to take any one of those
and depending on the size of your

35
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.170
breadboard, the ones we have look like
the one I have on the screen, but

36
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.850
you can buy longer ones, wider ones.

37
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.992
You can get all sorts of
different breadboards.

38
00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:16.242
But the ones we have, you can take
any given one of those ports and

39
00:02:16.242 --> 00:02:20.037
turn it into 25, or
I guess 24 cuz you're using one.

40
00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:27.237
But then you could do a jumper wire across
and get another 24 as well, 23 plus 24.

41
00:02:27.237 --> 00:02:28.383
Same thing for the power.

42
00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:35.120
So in the middle,
any given column is connected.

43
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.130
So along the top and along the bottom,
those rows are connected.

44
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.610
And then, any given column
in the middle is connected.

45
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.030
The top are all connected to each other.

46
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.080
The bottom are independent, right?

47
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.220
And you could very easily take a jumper
wire and cross over if you needed more.

48
00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.724
What you're doing on the breadboard is
basically taking wires to kind of make

49
00:02:58.724 --> 00:03:03.160
connections across those rows and
columns, but inside of the breadboard,

50
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.630
they are all connected.

51
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.512
All right, cool.

52
00:03:07.512 --> 00:03:15.233
So what we're going to do is we're going
to wire up a LED with a breadboard,

53
00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:20.270
so that we can use it with port seven or
pin seven.

54
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.900
And so what is that going to look like?

55
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.650
That is effectively
going to look like this.

56
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.390
We are gonna take from the ground and
I could take it to this top row, but

57
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.864
since I only need one,
I'm just gonna take it directly.

58
00:03:34.864 --> 00:03:36.640
And so you can see with the green,

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.620
every one of these holes here is
gonna be connected to the ground.

60
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.783
And every one in this very first
column here is gonna be connected to,

61
00:03:47.783 --> 00:03:51.096
this looks like pin five in this case.

62
00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:53.027
Pin A-5, right?

63
00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:56.270
So and I could put the LED
of this very first pair here

64
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.919
anywhere up cuz they're all connected.

65
00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.820
So I am gonna switch over and
we're gonna put that together.
