00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.231
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I'm gonna
transition to our next little project.

2
00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:09.222
For this next project,
the wiring is suspiciously simple,

3
00:00:09.222 --> 00:00:12.280
but it is definitely a fun one.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.770
So let's actually take
a look at the wiring.

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.370
And it might not be immediately
clear what this component is, and

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.190
that's totally fine.

7
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.330
But this is in your kit,
a magnetic door switch.

8
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.390
So it's got kind of an on or an off,

9
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.980
whether they're connected or
not connected, in this case.

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.500
And basically you could put one on
the door and one on the door frame.

11
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.260
And when they're connected,
that's one status of the switch, and

12
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.040
when someone opens the door, that's
another status of the switch, right?

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.510
You could put it in a drawer, right?

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.620
It's just basically two
magnetic pieces of plastic.

15
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.906
It's interesting, cuz on one hand,
it is a very simple component,

16
00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.298
which is again,
two magnetic pieces of plastic.

17
00:00:51.298 --> 00:00:55.698
On the other hand,
the idea that you can get a notification.

18
00:00:55.698 --> 00:00:58.012
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna get it working, and

19
00:00:58.012 --> 00:01:01.002
then we're gonna play with a third-party
API for the first time, right?

20
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.545
So we just played with sending
post requests to our own server.

21
00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:08.128
But we will be able to play with
a third-party API for sending

22
00:01:08.128 --> 00:01:13.130
us notifications when these two things get
separated, which will be a lot of fun.

23
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.388
The wiring is very simple,
we have one that's gonna go into pin a2,

24
00:01:18.388 --> 00:01:20.572
and one that goes to ground.

25
00:01:20.572 --> 00:01:25.757
And kinda show you how it's arranged,
because the first time I got one of these,

26
00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:29.050
I assumed they kind of go like this for
separating.

27
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.085
But that's not how it works, especially,

28
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.347
it took me suspiciously
long to figure that out.

29
00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:35.614
Especially if you look at
where the adhesive is,

30
00:01:35.614 --> 00:01:37.951
there's no way that would really work for
a door.

31
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:45.115
They actually go,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Like this, right?

32
00:01:45.115 --> 00:01:48.257
And when they are together,
that's one status, and then when

33
00:01:48.257 --> 00:01:52.123
they get far enough apart, that will
trigger the other status of the switch.

34
00:01:52.123 --> 00:01:57.300
All right, so technically this is very
similar to an on-off switch, right?

35
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.430
But we have closed,
we have open, closed, and open.

36
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.391
There's really only two
wires coming out of it, and

37
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:11.124
it is not polarized, so I will put one.

38
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:19.878
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Gotta stretch them out a
little bit, I'll put one into the ground,

39
00:02:19.878 --> 00:02:22.705
and I'll put the other one into a2.

40
00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:38.393
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I've also got ground,
zero, one, two, that's should work.

41
00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:40.214
And I'm gonna place these both.

42
00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:45.570
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: There's adhesive on
the bottom as well as little screw holes.

43
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.000
So how very fragile it is
to keep them together now

44
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.730
will not be the case when you use it for
real.

45
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.410
But as we play around with it,
it's a little tough.

46
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.050
But I'm just gonna place
them together like that.

47
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.410
And with that,

48
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.990
we should be ready to head over to our
playground and write a little bit of code.
