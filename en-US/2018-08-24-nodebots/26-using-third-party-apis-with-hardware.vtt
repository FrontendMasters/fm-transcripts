1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.079
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So
what could we do with this?

2
00:00:02.079 --> 00:00:07.813
Now it would be awesome if like this were
something where we are keeping our diary.

3
00:00:07.813 --> 00:00:11.712
Cuz I want to know when someone is
trying to read my diary, right?

4
00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.756
We could have it send us
some kind of notification.

5
00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:15.996
What kind of notification is up to you.

6
00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:19.295
You have it send you a text,
some kind of push notification,

7
00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:20.983
something along those lines.

8
00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:26.810
What we're going to do, what I'm gonna
use really quickly is a SendGrid API,

9
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.211
not because I work at SendGrid.

10
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:32.678
I do work at SendGrid, but
in this room right now we have,

11
00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:37.088
they cell signal turn off the text
messages like probably I don't like,

12
00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:39.648
not,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: If someone did open my

13
00:00:39.648 --> 00:00:41.675
secret drawer or
door that I didn't want opened,

14
00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:44.880
I don't know if an email is definitely
the first thing that's gonna get to me.

15
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.351
I would probably wanna text,
but that is one way to do it.

16
00:00:48.351 --> 00:00:52.033
So if we take a quick stop break for
a second.

17
00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.801
If you need to make a SendGrid account
if you wanna get an API key, or

18
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:56.985
you can just watch and
follow along, it is up to you.

19
00:00:56.985 --> 00:01:00.429
But I wanna give you an opportunity to
do that if it's something you wanna

20
00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.267
follow along and
implement if you don't have one already.

21
00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:05.378
So I've just logged in real quick.

22
00:01:05.378 --> 00:01:08.278
If I wanna make a new API key,
I scroll down to Settings.

23
00:01:08.278 --> 00:01:13.474
That's closed, you can open it like so.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We go ahead and

24
00:01:13.474 --> 00:01:14.453
create an API key.

25
00:01:14.453 --> 00:01:19.678
You can't see previous ones for
security reasons so

26
00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:22.892
we'll go ahead and create one.

27
00:01:22.892 --> 00:01:28.110
Give it a name, tussle run take

28
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.252
two,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

29
00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:37.914
I'll grab that and
very quickly close the window.

30
00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:44.970
[LAUGH] Sweet, so I have an API key which
I'm going to paste into another text file.

31
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.211
So my big plan on obscuring that.

32
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:53.925
It's not gonna work out too well,
but I will go ahead and

33
00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:59.163
there is an environment.sample.json
in place.

34
00:01:59.163 --> 00:02:04.323
You can make a copy of that and
put your API keys in there.

35
00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:06.022
Env.json is in gitignore so

36
00:02:06.022 --> 00:02:10.072
you don't have to worry about
accidentally publishing your keys.

37
00:02:10.072 --> 00:02:17.681
So I'll go make a new file code inv.json,
cool.

38
00:02:17.681 --> 00:02:19.682
Just paste a little quick right there, but

39
00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:23.515
if I look in inv.sample this is basic like
structure that some of my code is going to

40
00:02:23.515 --> 00:02:28.909
expect.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Neat,

41
00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.326
so go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

42
00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:39.061
just paste that one in there,
then we'll never see it again.

43
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:41.177
All right, so then I can basically,

44
00:02:46.883 --> 00:02:49.543
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Just, he says,

45
00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:55.437
I didn't capitalized the g, cool.

46
00:03:01.545 --> 00:03:04.380
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: ./env, so we'll have

47
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.323
that, we're pulling that key from there,
sweet.

48
00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:13.569
I'm actually just gonna pull in the entire
thing because I'm probably gonna use

49
00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:14.819
the variable SendGrid again.

50
00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.472
So we'll say env.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, neat.

51
00:03:19.472 --> 00:03:24.202
And the other thing I'm

52
00:03:24.202 --> 00:03:29.528
gonna need is,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Equals.

53
00:03:35.275 --> 00:03:37.263
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Pull in our mail API

54
00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:41.492
which is in our package json right here.

55
00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:42.587
All right, so now I have this API.

56
00:03:42.587 --> 00:03:45.988
I do need just a little
bit of configuration.

57
00:03:45.988 --> 00:03:52.772
So let's make a const openMessage
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

58
00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:56.872
we'll say, who will we send it to?

59
00:03:56.872 --> 00:03:59.098
I'm gonna make a quick Mailinator account,

60
00:03:59.098 --> 00:04:01.216
which is just the way
to send a disposable.

61
00:04:09.162 --> 00:04:13.720
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Test will run.

62
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.431
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So

63
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:21.080
we'll grab that email address.

64
00:04:28.392 --> 00:04:29.012
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Is hard,

65
00:04:29.012 --> 00:04:33.130
sometimes it's really hard to
select some text on the screen.

66
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.604
Cool, and we'll say that it's from,

67
00:04:43.976 --> 00:04:45.355
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Should be like no reply.

68
00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:46.327
Let's see if we have done that.

69
00:04:46.327 --> 00:04:47.342
That would be fun.

70
00:04:47.342 --> 00:04:49.525
But it will give it a subject.

71
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.352
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The Door Has Been Opened.

72
00:04:57.352 --> 00:05:03.560
The text is going to be everything

73
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.887
we feared is happening now.

74
00:05:08.887 --> 00:05:12.991
So fun fact about email,
is If you ever wanna talk about email for

75
00:05:12.991 --> 00:05:15.731
a few hours I'm always
happy to to do that.

76
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:17.996
I have to support Outlook 2007.

77
00:05:17.996 --> 00:05:20.818
So I've a lot, a lot of thoughts.

78
00:05:20.818 --> 00:05:24.257
I might need to have a few drinks
before I'm ready to share them all.

79
00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:28.396
Did you know that Outlook doesn't use

80
00:05:28.396 --> 00:05:33.059
Internet Explorer's rendering engine?

81
00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:34.852
It's uses Microsoft Words.

82
00:05:34.852 --> 00:05:41.781
[LAUGH] So if you thought developing for
I86 was bad, hold my beer.

83
00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:45.443
Cool, so we got this open message.

84
00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:50.618
And so when the door's opened,
I'm actually

85
00:05:50.618 --> 00:05:56.733
gonna be polite bring back
in that throttle function.

86
00:05:56.733 --> 00:06:01.267
Let's not blow up my inbox, cuz he saw me
as I was reaching over to touch the door

87
00:06:01.267 --> 00:06:04.453
sensor before I was triggering
a lot of open and close.

88
00:06:04.453 --> 00:06:11.273
Let's not have that affect my inbox.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Pull

89
00:06:11.273 --> 00:06:14.330
in that throttle method again.

90
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:23.673
Cool.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: handleOpen,

91
00:06:23.673 --> 00:06:30.621
we'll give it a function, to throttle.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'll

92
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:35.532
say like two seconds,
that should be sufficient.

93
00:06:35.532 --> 00:06:44.575
And what I'll do is I'll say sendgrid,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .send(openmessage).

94
00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:48.852
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And then that'll return

95
00:06:48.852 --> 00:06:54.754
our promise when it succeeds.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll console.log

96
00:06:59.692 --> 00:07:02.232
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Sent the warning message,

97
00:07:02.232 --> 00:07:04.224
preparing to panic.

98
00:07:04.224 --> 00:07:07.260
I don't know what's in the drawer and
if it fails for

99
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.537
some reason I do wanna know about that.

100
00:07:09.537 --> 00:07:13.666
Cuz I don't want any one of those live
coding situations where I repeatedly check

101
00:07:13.666 --> 00:07:16.896
the email and I don't see it
because like there was some error.

102
00:07:16.896 --> 00:07:23.032
Something went terribly, terribly wrong.

103
00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:25.798
Cool, so
we've got that in the handleOpen, and

104
00:07:25.798 --> 00:07:30.643
we'll go ahead and do that.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And this time,

105
00:07:30.643 --> 00:07:33.504
I'll define my function
before I attempt to use it.

106
00:07:33.504 --> 00:07:35.854
The other thing I'm gonna do is
just give myself a console.log.

107
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:51.415
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right, cool, so

108
00:07:51.415 --> 00:07:56.418
now when this opens we're gonna go send
me an email, and I'll check it whenever I

109
00:07:56.418 --> 00:08:01.535
check email.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

110
00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:04.197
go ahead and push that out.

111
00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:07.284
All right,
I'm going to very gently separate these.

112
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.461
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I didn't console log.

113
00:08:16.461 --> 00:08:17.042
Let's see.

114
00:08:17.042 --> 00:08:19.632
Let's go take a look cuz I'm
definitely consol log closing.

115
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.794
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Wonder if my throttle's

116
00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.014
a little too ambitious.

117
00:08:32.619 --> 00:08:37.451
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You know what,
let's just not be nice to my inbox.

118
00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:38.509
Let's just do it.

119
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.692
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Send that back over.

120
00:08:48.692 --> 00:08:55.193
I have apparently gotten no better
at adjusting that thing from afar.

121
00:08:55.193 --> 00:08:57.014
It's generally speaking a little bit.

122
00:08:57.014 --> 00:09:01.281
As I was playing with it, sitting like
a normal person, it's pretty tolerant of

123
00:09:01.281 --> 00:09:05.238
actually opening and closing, but
when you're reaching over it's extra

124
00:09:05.238 --> 00:09:12.337
fun.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are you

125
00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:16.772
actually executing handleOpen or are you
kind of like incurring it by accident?

126
00:09:16.772 --> 00:09:19.212
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yep, good catch.

127
00:09:19.212 --> 00:09:23.623
When I placed that console log I just
simply announced that it existed and

128
00:09:23.623 --> 00:09:25.297
didn't actually call it.

129
00:09:25.297 --> 00:09:28.609
So this should do the trick now,
maybe we put that throttle back though.

130
00:09:28.609 --> 00:09:35.821
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I think it's really great

131
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:40.176
that in a workshop where there's gonna be
a whole bunch of live wiring and hardware

132
00:09:40.176 --> 00:09:44.480
that most of our biggest mistakes are
the world's simplest JavaScript errors.

133
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.164
[LAUGH] It's just really gratifying.

134
00:09:49.164 --> 00:09:50.432
Principal Engineer, everyone.

135
00:09:50.432 --> 00:09:56.583
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

136
00:09:56.583 --> 00:10:00.700
so let's set this back up.

137
00:10:08.976 --> 00:10:10.444
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The moment there where I

138
00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:15.365
stopped spinning filled my heart with
dread, but now it's spinning again so,

139
00:10:15.365 --> 00:10:16.476
crisis averted.

140
00:10:28.032 --> 00:10:34.238
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I'm really excited.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

141
00:10:34.238 --> 00:10:40.361
Ready, I'm ready.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All

142
00:10:40.361 --> 00:10:43.642
right,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: No, something went

143
00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:51.129
terribly wrong.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I

144
00:10:51.129 --> 00:10:58.099
know what the issue is.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That's giving

145
00:10:58.099 --> 00:11:03.122
it one second then I will, a few important
in API key, but you don't actually use it.

146
00:11:03.122 --> 00:11:09.944
[LAUGH] APIs don't let you send stuff,
so we just get that going real quick.

147
00:11:28.779 --> 00:11:30.376
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So what I was missing,

148
00:11:30.376 --> 00:11:35.587
as I just mentioned, is you can require
a library, you can get an API key,

149
00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:40.477
but unless you tell the library
about the API key that doesn't work.

150
00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:44.099
Just having an API key,
the same great API, very cool but

151
00:11:44.099 --> 00:11:48.267
it doesn't psychically know who
you are and what your API key is.

152
00:11:48.267 --> 00:11:52.974
So we'll pull everything in,
and we'll just do this

153
00:11:52.974 --> 00:11:57.902
sengrid.setApiKey and
from the MPIK we have in there.

154
00:11:57.902 --> 00:11:59.704
All right, one more time with feeling,

155
00:11:59.704 --> 00:12:04.916
let me put these back together.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

156
00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:06.818
moment we've been waiting for.

157
00:12:15.807 --> 00:12:16.736
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right.

158
00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.841
Email was sent and
then we close it back up again.

159
00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:24.223
The door has been opened, right?

160
00:12:24.223 --> 00:12:27.103
So you can use whatever API you want.

161
00:12:27.103 --> 00:12:31.572
I used the API,
I don't actually work on the API, so

162
00:12:31.572 --> 00:12:36.054
it wasn't like a self plug but,
you can use Twilio.

163
00:12:36.054 --> 00:12:41.133
You can use any API you want,
you can do push notifications, anything.

164
00:12:41.133 --> 00:12:44.934
The basic point here is again,
now we have hardware components,

165
00:12:44.934 --> 00:12:47.780
our tester board available
to talk to anything.

166
00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:49.551
We used the door sensor
I mentioned earlier.

167
00:12:49.551 --> 00:12:53.533
You can use it with the hue bulbs,
anything you want, right?

168
00:12:53.533 --> 00:12:57.049
There's no actual limits as you
start to mix and match APIs and

169
00:12:57.049 --> 00:13:00.640
different web technologies and
these different components.

170
00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:04.961
There's a lot of really, really, really
interesting things that you can do, and

171
00:13:04.961 --> 00:13:06.133
if you think about it,

172
00:13:06.133 --> 00:13:09.919
we've done a bunch of them over
the course of the last few hours, right?

173
00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:11.858
Yeah, you can do some
really complicated things,

174
00:13:11.858 --> 00:13:13.850
but getting started with
this stuff is pretty easy.
