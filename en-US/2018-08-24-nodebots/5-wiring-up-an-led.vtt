00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.630
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So, this is a small LED.

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.440
The color that you grab does not matter.

3
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.480
You can either choose your favorite color
or you can take the approach I did,

4
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.880
which is choose whichever the first one
you touch is and take it out of the bag.

5
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.120
With a lot of electronic components,

6
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.740
we say that some of them are polarized and
others are non-polarized.

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.230
And all that means is in some cases,
the direction matters.

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.240
And in other cases,
the direction does not matter.

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.190
So, electricity in the circuit will
go from the kind of power source to

10
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.980
the ground.

11
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.409
So we need to complete a circuit.

12
00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:42.030
For non-polarized components, it doesn't
matter which end goes in which part.

13
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.628
For polarized components,
it does matter, right?

14
00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:52.930
An LED is a polarized component, which
means the way you plug it in matters.

15
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.930
Which leads us to the next
question of how do I tell?

16
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.154
If you look very closely at your LED,

17
00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:05.943
you'll notice at one end is
longer than the other end.

18
00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:08.346
That's how you tell [LAUGH].

19
00:01:08.346 --> 00:01:13.608
If you ever forget, then how do you tell?

20
00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:16.830
You Google it, [LAUGH].

21
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.167
For an LED, generally speaking, you'll do
this enough, you'll begin to remember that

22
00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:24.776
the longer end will go to the power and
the shorter end will go to the ground.

23
00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:29.623
Later on, we're gonna be playing
with an RGB LED, which have four,

24
00:01:29.623 --> 00:01:31.470
we'll call them prongs.

25
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.960
I don't think that's the right term but
we'll call them prongs.

26
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.600
And they're all different lengths and
the shortest one is not the ground.

27
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.180
And so what you will likely do is look it
up, probably every time that you use it.

28
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.166
Cuz that is what I do and
it seems to be successful for me.

29
00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:53.819
But in this case, the longer end is
gonna go to our power source and

30
00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:56.787
the shorter end is gonna go to the ground.

31
00:01:56.787 --> 00:02:01.877
So, if everyone committed that
diagram I showed earlier to memory,

32
00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:04.081
which I know that you all did.

33
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:08.425
We all remember that the ground is

34
00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:13.243
the very first input on either port.

35
00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:16.180
So I can take the shorter end.

36
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.588
I can.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Make

37
00:02:19.588 --> 00:02:22.344
sure the camera can see.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah,

38
00:02:22.344 --> 00:02:26.143
this is a new fun challenge.

39
00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:30.190
Cool, I'm gonna put the shorter
end in that very first port.

40
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.730
And the longer end is going
to go into the 0 port.

41
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.393
If you look very closely at your device,
you'll see that they're labeled GND for

42
00:02:38.393 --> 00:02:43.073
ground, 3v3 for the power source and
then 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

43
00:02:43.073 --> 00:02:47.610
So I want the shorter end
to go into the ground and

44
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.857
the longer end to go into the zero port.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: After this,

45
00:02:54.857 --> 00:02:57.933
we'll actually be connecting
jumper wires to these ports and

46
00:02:57.933 --> 00:02:59.479
it will be a little bit easier.

47
00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.662
Cuz you can imagine, if I had a LED in the
other port, one had to go into port seven,

48
00:03:03.662 --> 00:03:07.379
doing it like this is not really
feasible because it's not long enough.

49
00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.585
So we'll use a bread
board in a little bit.

50
00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:15.203
But for now, we're just gonna plug
it directly into the board, cool.
