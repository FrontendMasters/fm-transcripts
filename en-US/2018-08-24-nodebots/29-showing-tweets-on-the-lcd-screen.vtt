1
00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:05.152
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I've set up and
configured the Twitter API keys.

2
00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.690
And those are in my env.json.

3
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.802
So I can kinda pull that in.

4
00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:14.757
I'll say cost env =
require(./env) with node,

5
00:00:14.757 --> 00:00:19.518
if it's JSON, you can omit the suffix, or

6
00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:24.304
you can put .json, either one will work.

7
00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:26.370
So now we have that key in there.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.466
There's another fun little library
that I put in your package json,

9
00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.312
which is node twitter stream.

10
00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:37.112
If you have a twitter api key,
it will get you a real time feed

11
00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:41.242
of every tweet that contains a given word,
right?

12
00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:46.522
Which is for most words you can think of,
if you thought the temperature sensor

13
00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:52.052
was a bit of an onslaught then this as
well, and they're pretty big JSON objects.

14
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.250
So we'll just do something really simple.

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.593
And again, showing, especially now
that Twitter is at 256 characters,

16
00:00:58.593 --> 00:01:03.126
showing 256 character on
a display that could only show 16.

17
00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:06.281
[LAUGH] It's definitely a power play but

18
00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:09.914
the point is not necessarily
that you need yet

19
00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:14.803
another way to see a real time
stream of twitter in your life.

20
00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:19.555
It's mostly about pulling in an API and
kind of like again we send stuff out into

21
00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:24.176
the world and now, I think it would be
cool to like pool stuff into the world.

22
00:01:24.176 --> 00:01:28.020
And this was the real
time API that I chose.

23
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.483
So this example in the spark fun,
inventors got two where the GPS

24
00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:37.702
coordinates of where the International
Space Station is currently over.

25
00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:42.638
That's a little bit better for
our screen but they took this one, so

26
00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:45.503
I'm gonna use the twitter API, cool.

27
00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:50.608
All right, so the other thing
I'm gonna pull in is Twitter,

28
00:01:50.608 --> 00:01:56.826
I'll call it the require, and
the library is the node-tweet-stream.

29
00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:58.832
It's a bunch of life fun
things you can do with it.

30
00:01:58.832 --> 00:02:03.363
For me it's like anytime I've done
some stuff with real time APIs.

31
00:02:03.363 --> 00:02:05.443
I did a talk a few years ago
on real time APIs in Ember.

32
00:02:05.443 --> 00:02:09.603
It's for a long time been my go-to for
real time API?

33
00:02:09.603 --> 00:02:12.618
A real time API in Ember made
a lot more sense for this,

34
00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:14.629
showing the tweets in an Ember app.

35
00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.722
Not a 16 character thing but
it is my go-to real time API, so

36
00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.393
we're gonna go with it.

37
00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:22.922
Cool, and then we just wanna
instantiate a new instance of that.

38
00:02:22.922 --> 00:02:28.536
So we'll say const t = new Twitter.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

39
00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:32.212
we'll give it that environment variables
that I set up before that I am.

40
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.495
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And has a lower case t,

41
00:02:35.495 --> 00:02:38.112
cuz that's in the json object.

42
00:02:38.112 --> 00:02:41.585
So basically you can have an on tweet,
an on air and

43
00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:44.330
do something when that stuff happens.

44
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.252
And then you basically say what
you wanna do when that happens.

45
00:02:48.252 --> 00:02:50.337
So I'll wait for my board to be set up.

46
00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:57.546
And I'll say, t.on("tweet").
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

47
00:02:57.546 --> 00:03:04.956
when that tweet comes in-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I will,

48
00:03:04.956 --> 00:03:07.443
let's go get the,
we'll get the text of it.

49
00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:18.635
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And I'll get the-

50
00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:26.400
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: FirstSixteen.

51
00:03:32.457 --> 00:03:33.019
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

52
00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:39.024
we'll get the const secondSixteen.

53
00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:51.919
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And what we will do is
that I will grab one of these we'll print

54
00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:58.056
the first few rows.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: FirstSixteen,

55
00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:05.024
then the secondSixteen.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool, and

56
00:04:05.024 --> 00:04:10.703
so-
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: FirstSixteen,

57
00:04:12.918 --> 00:04:16.040
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: SecondSixteen.

58
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.124
And then finally when that's all ready,
we'll track a hashtag.

59
00:04:24.151 --> 00:04:25.531
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hashtag.

60
00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:29.043
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Let's try "#nodebots"

61
00:04:29.043 --> 00:04:34.416
this probably won't work esoteric enough
that someone's gonna have to tweet,

62
00:04:34.416 --> 00:04:36.007
but we can handle that.

63
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:40.463
When I was testing this out on
the second I used Pizza, bad choice.

64
00:04:40.463 --> 00:04:44.963
There's a lot of discussion of pizza
happening right now at this very moment.

65
00:04:44.963 --> 00:04:46.185
So that's a bit much.

66
00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.489
If nodebots seems too quiet and

67
00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:50.312
we're like worried that our code
doesn't work we'll try pizza.

68
00:04:50.312 --> 00:04:54.163
But I'm pretty sure that's just gonna be,
we're just gonna see letters flying.

69
00:04:54.163 --> 00:04:57.270
Especially we'll see
the first 16 characters, or

70
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.525
our first 32 characters have
a lot of tweets on Pizza.

71
00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:05.385
So do with #nodebots and
then somebody's job is once

72
00:05:05.385 --> 00:05:10.053
this is running, is to tweet.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Cool,

73
00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:14.862
so I'll do a t2 run

74
00:05:14.862 --> 00:05:20.489
playground
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: And

75
00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:21.761
we'll take that for a spin,

76
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:27.011
see if I made any mistakes along the way.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Oops, I did already.

77
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:30.719
So I put that t.track
inside of the on tweet,

78
00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:35.023
which will have another
order of operations issue.

79
00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:40.097
So I'm just gonna move that down.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Glad I

80
00:05:40.097 --> 00:05:42.782
caught that one quickly.

81
00:05:42.782 --> 00:05:47.574
All right, cool, so let's switch over.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We do

82
00:05:47.574 --> 00:05:51.846
need to wait a second or
two for the code to deploy.

83
00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:57.154
And then I will either see a row of boxes
or I will see some tweets on nodebots.

84
00:05:57.154 --> 00:06:00.109
Once this starts up,
if you tweet now, it'll be too soon.

85
00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:02.381
You've got to wait until it starts up.

86
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:05.012
It is lit up, but not fully there yet.

87
00:06:05.012 --> 00:06:12.574
Cool, initialized, we're good to go.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Hi, from my nodebots.

88
00:06:12.574 --> 00:06:16.579
Looks I had it off by one error
on that string slicing so, it is,

89
00:06:16.579 --> 00:06:19.233
hi from my nodebots, but I missed that b.

90
00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:21.730
So it should start from the 16th one and
move forward.

91
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.186
Somebody else wants to tweet,

92
00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:29.129
it will realtime push to this device.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Awesome.

93
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.356
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's

94
00:06:31.356 --> 00:06:32.296
fast.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Yeah.

95
00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:37.289
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You can

96
00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.683
use this library for anything you want.

97
00:06:38.683 --> 00:06:42.654
You can also just run that code in
a node script and you can do Pizza and

98
00:06:42.654 --> 00:06:45.241
see what happens then, anything you want.

99
00:06:45.241 --> 00:06:50.770
Yeah, so as tweets coming in,
they push to a device.
