00:00:00.152 --> 00:00:03.249
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: So I'm gonna actually
write this code back in the playground.js

2
00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:04.665
file cuz it's just simpler.

3
00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:07.355
I don't wanna like,
I'm gonna need that express code later,

4
00:00:07.355 --> 00:00:08.638
and I don't wanna delete it.

5
00:00:08.638 --> 00:00:12.054
It's really the only reason I
have these two different files.

6
00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:15.376
So I'm gonna go write in playground
cuz there's less stuff going on there.

7
00:00:15.376 --> 00:00:17.546
So this all stays the same.

8
00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:22.032
I miss my RGB LED, but it is no
longer with us on the bread board so

9
00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:28.652
I'll get rid of this code.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Very cool.

10
00:00:28.652 --> 00:00:32.008
So we'll call this,
it's like a weather monitor.

11
00:00:34.422 --> 00:00:36.408
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll say a new five and

12
00:00:36.408 --> 00:00:39.192
this is gonna be the multi class.

13
00:00:39.192 --> 00:00:42.390
This is doing a lot of things.

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.727
Like Johnny five does need
a little bit of help though and

15
00:00:46.727 --> 00:00:48.771
need to tell it what it is.

16
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:54.599
So we'll say controller and
as I mentioned earlier,

17
00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:58.232
this is the infamous BME280.

18
00:00:58.232 --> 00:01:00.084
You might be like,
how am I supposed to remember that?

19
00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:03.309
The trick is just to have to type it and
say it a whole bunch of times.

20
00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.610
It's also on the component.

21
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.145
[LAUGH] That's the other option is
it is in small print in the little

22
00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:11.629
component on the red board, cool.

23
00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:18.904
And then not dissimilar from our input
field the monitor is gonna have and

24
00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:23.435
change event so
every time the temperature,

25
00:01:23.435 --> 00:01:29.039
parametric pressure, or
relative humidity changes,

26
00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:36.095
this will fire an event if your
suspicion is won't that be a lot, yes.

27
00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:37.276
[LAUGH] Yes.

28
00:01:37.276 --> 00:01:39.747
It's gonna be, it's gonna be insane.

29
00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:46.128
[LAUGH] absolutely, but
we'll deal with that shortly.

30
00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:52.848
First we're going to let the like,
onslaught of information work, cool.

31
00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:56.562
So when that happens,
whenever something changes,

32
00:01:56.562 --> 00:02:00.777
we need to go ahead and
just get that data off the controller.

33
00:02:00.777 --> 00:02:05.763
So we'll actually say const

34
00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:12.625
temperature = monitor.thermometer

35
00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:19.788
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .fahrenheit.

36
00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:23.599
If you have strong feelings about Celsius,

37
00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.826
you are welcome to get
a Celsius rating instead.

38
00:02:27.826 --> 00:02:33.566
I am going to go with Fahrenheit, cool.

39
00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:38.301
I will do const pressure.

40
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:43.468
That is different from live coding in
front of a bunch of people and live

41
00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:49.794
wiring, we're talking about barometric
pressure, not just like peer judgement.

42
00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:54.873
Barometer, the pressure.

43
00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.500
It's nice to have some auto

44
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.669
complete in place.
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: He says,

45
00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.868
making sure that thermometer
is spelled correctly.

46
00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:07.850
And then we'll do relative, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just to remove headache

47
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.142
later on,
I think you spelled Fahrenheit wrong.

48
00:03:10.142 --> 00:03:11.264
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: Thank you so much!

49
00:03:11.264 --> 00:03:19.706
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: You're a hero.

50
00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:22.537
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: That was definitely,

51
00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:25.892
cuz I would have just,
I would have gotten a thing undefined.

52
00:03:25.892 --> 00:03:28.289
It wouldn't have crashed,
but it definitely,

53
00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.861
I would have had that very
confused look on my face and

54
00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:34.557
then we would have had to redeploy again
so it's awesome that you got that.

55
00:03:34.557 --> 00:03:42.376
Humidity will be monitor,
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .hygrometer,

56
00:03:44.127 --> 00:03:46.545
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: .relative humidity.

57
00:03:46.545 --> 00:03:49.837
Cool, so now, we have these three things.

58
00:03:49.837 --> 00:03:55.724
What we will go ahead and do is we're
just gonna start out by console logging.

59
00:03:55.724 --> 00:03:59.442
Those three constants.

60
00:03:59.442 --> 00:04:05.424
Temperature, pressure, relativeHumidity.

61
00:04:05.424 --> 00:04:08.870
All right, very cool.

62
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.965
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
start the deploy going here and

63
00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:16.145
then I'm gonna create a branch and push it
up just in case you need to compare notes.

64
00:04:16.145 --> 00:04:18.886
I would probably wait until
we verify that my code works.

65
00:04:18.886 --> 00:04:22.856
But I will push it up regardless
cuz cool thing about git,

66
00:04:22.856 --> 00:04:24.935
you can always push up again.

67
00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:25.807
All right, cool.

68
00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:32.044
So I'm gonna go over and I will do a t2,

69
00:04:32.044 --> 00:04:38.660
run playground and then as that happens,

70
00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.818
I will make a new branch and

71
00:04:42.818 --> 00:04:46.989
I will call it bma 280.

72
00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:48.405
It's a memorable name.

73
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.362
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: The fact that I didn't
wanna open a terminal tab made me

74
00:05:00.362 --> 00:05:03.642
use the GitHub app, and I actually don't
know how to make a branch on that.

75
00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:11.868
So I'll do
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: We'll

76
00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:15.942
push up the change to that real time code.

77
00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:22.931
And we'll check out my BME 280 branch.

78
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.917
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: I've made a mess of git,

79
00:05:40.917 --> 00:05:44.916
so I'll rectify that real quick.

80
00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:49.213
Live coding, live hardware,
and now live git.

81
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:18.111
&gt;&gt; Steve Kinney: All right,

82
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.942
I'm gonna go back over to that
tab that was open before.

83
00:06:20.942 --> 00:06:23.307
And you can see my data is coming in.

84
00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:24.836
And boy, is it?

85
00:06:24.836 --> 00:06:31.539
So fun fact is that the temperature in
here is around 74 degrees Fahrenheit.

86
00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.500
The pressure is 96 and change.

87
00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.837
The relative humidity is around 53%.

88
00:06:38.837 --> 00:06:41.082
Just to verify that any of this works,

89
00:06:41.082 --> 00:06:44.814
I need to find a way to change
the temperature around my sensor.

90
00:06:44.814 --> 00:06:49.595
It turns out that I brought with
me a 98.6 degree heat source.

91
00:06:49.595 --> 00:06:50.991
That I'm just going to take.

92
00:06:50.991 --> 00:06:54.529
Take my finger and place it on the sensor.

93
00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:58.137
And we can see that it's
kind of rising to 84.

94
00:06:58.137 --> 00:07:01.220
I don't know if it's gonna go all
the way to 95, but it's slowly going up,

95
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.801
verifying that this thing is working.

96
00:07:02.801 --> 00:07:06.949
That is a very scientific way of
making sure that your readings

97
00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:10.715
are somewhat accurate,
which is put your finger on it.

98
00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:14.180
Which is definitely counter
intuitive to everything I was taught

99
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.826
about electronics as a child.

100
00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:19.062
Which is take your fingers off of that,
don't put your fork in the socket.

101
00:07:19.062 --> 00:07:21.984
But it works in this case.

102
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:23.952
So it's a lot of data, and
it's really interesting.

103
00:07:23.952 --> 00:07:28.868
And hopefully, there's a bunch of things
from some of the technology we looked at

104
00:07:28.868 --> 00:07:32.015
today that are kind of
floating around in your head.

105
00:07:32.015 --> 00:07:36.042
Could you take all this data and
start pushing out all the web sockets?

106
00:07:36.042 --> 00:07:36.848
Yes.

107
00:07:36.848 --> 00:07:37.625
[LAUGH] Right?

108
00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:41.795
Could you do a whole bunch of
really kind of interesting things?

109
00:07:41.795 --> 00:07:45.191
Could you post it to a web server,
absolutely.

110
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:47.892
I like to try maybe some other things.

111
00:07:47.892 --> 00:07:52.380
But could you change the color of
different LEDs based on this data?

112
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.722
Absolutely, you can start to mix and
match.

113
00:07:54.722 --> 00:07:57.134
For a lot of things we're looking at,
is a few things in isolation.

114
00:07:57.134 --> 00:07:58.741
But as you begin to mix and match stuff,

115
00:07:58.741 --> 00:08:00.650
you can start to figure
some of that stuff out.
