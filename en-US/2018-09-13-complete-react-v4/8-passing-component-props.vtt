00:00:00.313 --> 00:00:03.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I wanna make it, so
that this pet component can be used for

2
00:00:03.941 --> 00:00:06.421
multiple different pet types, right?

3
00:00:06.421 --> 00:00:12.972
I don't want it to just be useful for
Brian's pet, right.

4
00:00:12.972 --> 00:00:16.453
So what we're going to do is we're going
to make this a little bit more flexible.

5
00:00:16.453 --> 00:00:18.923
So what we're going to do
is we're going to have pet.

6
00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:21.120
Take into something called props.

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.560
So these are gonna be properties that are
gonna be passed from the parent component.

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.352
The parent component
being app in this case.

9
00:00:27.352 --> 00:00:34.576
To the child component which in
this case will be Pet, right?

10
00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:39.317
So we're gonna accept
props from the parent.

11
00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:45.998
And rather than say, lunar right here
we're gonna say, props.name, right?

12
00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:48.509
So we're gonna pass from the parents,

13
00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:53.316
a name prop which is going to be rendered
out instead of just luna directly.

14
00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:57.346
Same here, we're gonna say,

15
00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:02.617
props.animal and here it's gonna be,

16
00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:07.431
props.breed, so that's a start.

17
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:12.710
Now, we have made this a lot more
flexible that it can represent any pet.

18
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:19.422
And here,
I'm going to actually do this all at once.

19
00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:23.834
We're going to add these
props are gonna be passed in.

20
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:30.962
So I am going to say name,

21
00:01:30.962 --> 00:01:35.715
Luna, animal,

22
00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:40.466
she is a dog, and

23
00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:47.602
breed she is a habanies.

24
00:01:47.602 --> 00:01:50.025
But now,
we can have it represent not just luna but

25
00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:52.000
we can have it represent other animals.

26
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.521
So this is gonna be,
this is my bird growing up.

27
00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:00.385
She's a cockatiel.

28
00:02:02.055 --> 00:02:04.699
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
this is my neighbor's cat.

29
00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:06.858
So she named her cat Doink.

30
00:02:06.858 --> 00:02:08.204
I don't really understand that.

31
00:02:08.204 --> 00:02:11.870
I think, it's cuz the cat's mostly
blind and just runs into walls.

32
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.106
It's an adorable cat.

33
00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:17.201
And she's a mixed breed of some sort.

34
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:19.545
But name it whatever pets you
feel like naming it, right?

35
00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.271
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
what do you expect to see?

36
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:28.138
Rather than having Luna, dog, Havanese,
now we're gonna have Luna, dog,

37
00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:29.782
Havanese for the top one.

38
00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:33.645
But we're gonna have Pepper, bird,
Cockatiel underneath that and

39
00:02:33.645 --> 00:02:35.851
Doink, cat, mixed underneath that.

40
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:41.099
So if I save this and come back over here
and refresh the page, you'll see now

41
00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:46.844
that we have this flexible pet component
that's rendering out different things.

42
00:02:46.844 --> 00:02:48.511
So now, it has become a lot more flexible.

43
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:53.440
Now, this is actually starting to
seem a little bit more useful than

44
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.520
just rendering out mark up.
