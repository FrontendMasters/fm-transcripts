00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.717
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go to pet.js,
and let's make each individual

2
00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:11.802
pet page link to their details page for
that particular pet.

3
00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:19.344
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I want you to

4
00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:26.406
change this div right here and
the wrapping div to be a link.

5
00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:29.402
And then I'm gonna do
the auto import up here.

6
00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:35.524
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But if you look up here,
it imported link at the top for me.

7
00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:43.792
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So the only thing I
did here was import link at the top.

8
00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:52.671
And I changed the wrapping div from link,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To div and

9
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:57.512
the only thing I have to add is to

10
00:00:57.512 --> 00:01:03.287
= ['/details/$(id)'],

11
00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:09.442
you know, the template string thing.

12
00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have to pull
ID up here I guess as well.

13
00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:25.648
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I pulled id out
of this.props right here on line 6.

14
00:01:29.052 --> 00:01:35.483
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here I changed the online
15, I changed the div to a link.

15
00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:41.502
I put in a to to the curly brace then a
back tick to do a template string, right?

16
00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:46.372
To /details and then ${id}.

17
00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:52.549
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now each one of these is
going to be a link to a details page for

18
00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.806
that particular animal.

19
00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
link comes from Reach router.

20
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.310
It ends up being an A tag,
which is good, right,

21
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.260
because if it's an A tag
it's very accessible.

22
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.550
People can Cmd+click on it and
it opens a new tab.

23
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.150
All the good things that come
with being a real anchor tag.

24
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.307
Reach router does this on purpose to
force you to use anchor tags because

25
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.157
links should always be anchor tags.

26
00:02:22.157 --> 00:02:23.714
It's just the correct way of doing it.

27
00:02:25.773 --> 00:02:30.076
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When you clicked on it,
it said undefined in the browser.

28
00:02:30.076 --> 00:02:31.353
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, you're right.

29
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.382
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You have to
pass it in here as well.

30
00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:39.709
Do I not have, I do,
I just didn't say that.

31
00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.052
So down here,
you have to say id = [pet.id].

32
00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:48.646
And I know someone's gonna ask,
can't you just use key?

33
00:02:48.646 --> 00:02:52.739
React does not actually pass the key,
so don't use key.

34
00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:01.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So yes, thank you.

35
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:08.630
Now, if you look here, you'll see down
at the bottom, it is actually a real ID.

36
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.594
Thank you.

37
00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:23.431
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, last thing let's make
this adopt me header clickable as well, so

38
00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:25.080
that it goes back to the home page.

39
00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.886
People expect that if you click the brand
that it goes back to the home page.

40
00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:32.901
So let's go to app.js and

41
00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:39.104
surround the h1 with a link to "/" and

42
00:03:39.104 --> 00:03:44.405
then put the adopt me inside of it.

43
00:03:47.383 --> 00:03:50.334
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna say,
hey I don't know what that is.

44
00:03:50.334 --> 00:03:51.952
So you can just pull that in from,

45
00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:03.605
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

46
00:04:05.575 --> 00:04:08.597
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
import link as well from reach/router.

47
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.413
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again,
if I would go and refresh.

48
00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:24.790
Now we can click on it.

49
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.704
And it will take us back to the home page.

50
00:04:31.545 --> 00:04:35.508
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Except that's not
how I wanted to do it, sorry.

51
00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:41.920
So delete the h1 around it and
put this inside of a header.

52
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.230
This will just get the styling correct for
my CSS,

53
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.128
there's no reason you
have to do it this way.

54
00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:49.224
Like that.

55
00:04:53.746 --> 00:04:54.883
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I have a header.

56
00:04:54.883 --> 00:04:59.175
And then here, I put a link to,
and then delete the h1.

57
00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:06.175
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I think that will fix
all the, yeah, now it has a nice styling.

58
00:05:09.564 --> 00:05:12.275
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That my wife pointed
out to me is McDonald's colors,

59
00:05:12.275 --> 00:05:13.730
way after I was done with it.
