00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now that we have react,
react dom being loaded, we have our style

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.780
coming in, let's go ahead, and
actually, write some react code.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.010
What does React do for us?

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.123
What is the fundamental paradigm of React?

5
00:00:14.123 --> 00:00:17.510
The fundamental paradigm of React
is that you make components, right?

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.206
And you use those components
to make other components.

7
00:00:20.206 --> 00:00:22.465
Which then you use to
make other components,

8
00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:24.552
which then you use to make applications.

9
00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:28.607
It's just smaller components that get
built up to bigger and bigger components,

10
00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:31.561
until your biggest component
is your entire application.

11
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:36.222
So you're writing this code, that kind of,
it mimics the markup that you want to show

12
00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:40.687
up on the page, and then, as you kind of
modify the state over time, react changes

13
00:00:40.687 --> 00:00:45.190
the bare minimum amount of the browser
dom to actually achieve your application.

14
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.960
So it ends up being really performant,

15
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.110
because it's minimizing how much
updating your doing to the dom.

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.580
So what I wanna do right now,
is I wanna make you a first component for

17
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.590
React, okay?

18
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.606
So we're gonna make one called App.

19
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:04.550
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
I'll scroll that up so you can see that.

20
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.489
So const App equals, and
we're gonna make this an arrow function.

21
00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:16.117
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is something
that probably bears mentioning,

22
00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:18.668
you see this little
arrow thing right here?

23
00:01:18.668 --> 00:01:23.165
This is called a font ligature,
this is actually an equal science and

24
00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:28.531
angle bracket next to each other, so if I
put a space between them, you can see it.

25
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.249
But if I put them together,
my font combines them into one thing, so

26
00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:32.647
it's a little bit easier to read.

27
00:01:36.193 --> 00:01:39.156
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's another cool
thing that VS Code can do for you,

28
00:01:39.156 --> 00:01:41.400
I know Sublime now does it, as well.

29
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.564
The font is called Dank Mono,

30
00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:49.410
it's dank.sh, I think.

31
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.130
This one is 50 bucks, but
it is worth it, I would say.

32
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.705
If you want that one that is
free that does the same thing,

33
00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:00.720
there's one called Fira Code,
which is one that I used for

34
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.119
a long time, looks like that.

35
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.460
So you install that, and then, with
VSCode, you have to enable font ligatures.

36
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.661
The reason why I'm showing you this, is
because, inevitably, afterwards I always

37
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:18.203
get asked this question,
what's your font, what's your theme?

38
00:02:18.203 --> 00:02:22.313
It's Monaci is the theme, and
font family, Dank Mono, and

39
00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:26.030
here, you have to enable
font ligatures right there.

40
00:02:30.742 --> 00:02:34.621
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so in case
you're wondering, that's what the arrow

41
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:39.135
sign actually is, it's equals, and
the angle bracket next to each other,

42
00:02:39.135 --> 00:02:42.186
one that you'll also see
in here is double equals.

43
00:02:42.186 --> 00:02:45.959
It just makes a really long equal sign,
and if I put three,

44
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.971
it makes one with three lines.

45
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:50.740
If you see one of those in the future,
I'll try and call them out as I do it.

46
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.198
I like it, cuz it just kinda
combines the things in my mind,

47
00:02:54.198 --> 00:02:55.670
I don't have to think
about three equals signs.

48
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.560
I just see one icon.

49
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.700
And it's pretty.

50
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.340
I think, that's really key part of here,
is that I find it very pretty.

51
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.500
Okay, enough of pretty things [LAUGH].

52
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.540
So we've made an error function here,
this is the same as just writing.

53
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.810
It's really similar to writing something
like this, function like that.

54
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.550
But an error function is
just a little bit shorter.

55
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.399
It's right,
this just a new way of writing JavaScript.
