00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.971
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this brings us to another commit point.

2
00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:07.968
If you've fallen behind here there's the
commit down here that you can get on to.

3
00:00:07.968 --> 00:00:11.505
It also concludes our section
on handling async UIs.

4
00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:13.935
We are gonna be talking about forms next,

5
00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:17.128
because everyone has to write
forms [LAUGH] I think web,

6
00:00:17.128 --> 00:00:22.000
being a web developer you can just retitle
yourself as professional form creator.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.210
So the next thing we're gonna do is
we're going to make it a little bit so

8
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.480
we can actually searches on this, right
now it's just searching for somewhere and

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.820
some pretefined location
that we define at bill time,

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.520
not something the user can
actually interact with.

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.400
This is not actually super user for
finding pets at the moment.

12
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.560
So, what we're going to do is we're going
to make a search kind of component.

13
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.480
So let's go do that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So make a new file.

14
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.010
Call it SearchParams.JS we're
going to import react from react.

15
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.681
Class search params extend

16
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:19.037
react.componant
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

17
00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:24.270
down here at the bottom,
export default SearchParams.

18
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.910
Okay?

19
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.580
Here, we're going to track location,
animal, and

20
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.890
breed cause those are the three search
facets that we're worried about.

21
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.988
So state is going to reflect that.

22
00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:37.870
It's going to be location, has to,

23
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.616
you're going to need some
sort of default location.

24
00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:46.615
So I'll just stick to Seattle, Washington.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Animal,

25
00:01:46.615 --> 00:01:48.530
for now it will just be all animals.

26
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.889
We'll leave that as an empty string.

27
00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:54.030
And breed.

28
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.410
Which again, we won't have any
green necessarily set here, but

29
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.650
that'll get set here as well.

30
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.890
Okay, we'll have a render method.

31
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.132
And here, we will return div

32
00:02:10.132 --> 00:02:14.977
className = search-params.

33
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:22.281
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then we'll do a label here.

34
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:23.347
Label.

35
00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:26.817
And if you remember I told
you that you can't use four.

36
00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:30.253
Normally labels would have a for

37
00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:36.810
here to assign it to some sort of,
to some input, right?

38
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.940
But for is a reserved JavaScript
word because of for loops, right?

39
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.688
So we're gonna day htmlFor here,
that's why that is.

40
00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:51.746
So For="location".
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then

41
00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:56.953
here we'll put Location and
inside of that we'll also have our input.

42
00:02:56.953 --> 00:02:59.326
This can be capitalized, too.

43
00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:02.856
Location.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Input.

44
00:03:07.298 --> 00:03:08.442
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Id = location so

45
00:03:08.442 --> 00:03:10.164
that this matches this.

46
00:03:10.164 --> 00:03:13.192
That's the only reason we're
putting the Id in there.

47
00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:18.943
Value = This.state.location.

48
00:03:18.943 --> 00:03:25.169
And placeholder = location.

49
00:03:36.132 --> 00:03:37.353
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

50
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.080
And for now, we'll just worry about
location then we'll get to the other ones

51
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.781
here in just a second.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,

52
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:49.870
we have a pretty simple route, right?

53
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.960
That you can go in there, you can type
in the location and change the location.

54
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.970
That's all that's gonna happen here.

55
00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.241
So I want you to go back into App.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're

56
00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:05.570
gonna make one more route here, and
this is gonna be called SearchParams.

57
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.650
And again, I'm gonna be using
VSCode to auto-import this.

58
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.150
So I'm gonna hit enter, that'll import
it at the top, which I'll show you.

59
00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.953
Actually, I can just show you right there,

60
00:04:15.953 --> 00:04:20.586
it imported up here on line 6.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

61
00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:23.745
then the path is going to equal to,

62
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:29.205
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: /search-params,

63
00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:34.730
like that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

64
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.700
I just added lines six and
line 18 that's all I changed here.

65
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.100
So fundamentally,
I didn't really show you anything new.

66
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:46.610
This is just getting all of the pieces so

67
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.490
that I can show you how
to interact with forms.

68
00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.043
So let's go look at our
browser really quick.

69
00:04:54.188 --> 00:04:56.912
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: search-params.

70
00:04:56.912 --> 00:05:04.060
And here I have the best form that's ever
been created, if I do say so myself.

71
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:12.580
I want you to try and type in this form.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You broke the browser.

72
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.550
This is my favorite demo of doing.

73
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.510
Cuz people get so frustrated.

74
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.860
It's like, this is so easy to do,
in fact, it's very hard to break inputs.

75
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.000
[LAUGH] It's very difficult to
make it's impossible to type.

76
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.530
And yet
we have successfully done that here.
