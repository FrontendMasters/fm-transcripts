00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.830
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Next thing I
wanted to do here is I wanted to,

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.030
what we're doing here,
these are called function components.

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.850
You'll also see them called stateless
functional components sometimes.

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.920
I think that's just a mouthful and
a bit redundant.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.330
So I just call them function components,
cuz it's a function that is a component.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.690
A lot of the times, you'll be using
what are called class components.

7
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.069
So we're gonna convert App here into
what's called a class component.

8
00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.419
So I'm gonna say class App extends

9
00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:39.298
React.Component.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

10
00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:42.088
and then I'm gonna make a function
inside of that called render.

11
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.360
And the body of render is
just going to be this.

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.781
So I'm going to take all this stuff that
we have here, and I'm going to cut that.

13
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:57.911
I'm just gonna paste that
inside of our render function

14
00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:02.797
here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

15
00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:05.095
then delete this App thing.

16
00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:17.749
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So why do this?

17
00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:22.729
Well, these class components actually
have a lot more flexibility in what they

18
00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:23.261
can do.

19
00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:27.568
They have more,
I guess they're more powerful.

20
00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:31.779
Some people elect to make
class components all the time.

21
00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:34.255
And they never use the other
way of doing components,

22
00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.320
the function components like this.

23
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.290
They'll never do it this way.

24
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.500
They only do these ones.

25
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.080
Other people prefer that if something
doesn't need all of the extra bells and

26
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.990
whistles, they'll just do
the function components.

27
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.880
Otherwise, they'll convert
it to a class component.

28
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.120
Cuz some people just don't like converting
back and forth between class and

29
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.720
functions based on what they need.

30
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.258
People ask me what do I do,
and I don't really know.

31
00:01:58.258 --> 00:02:01.500
[LAUGH] I kinda go back and
forth on how I feel about it.

32
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.410
When you have to convert between the two,
it is kind of annoying.

33
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.490
And I do like the simplicity of just, this
is just something that returns something.

34
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.037
So I do tend to use these function
components sometimes if I have

35
00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:20.014
something that doesn't need state or
any of the other life cycle methods or

36
00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.937
all the other more
powerful parts of React.

37
00:02:22.937 --> 00:02:26.534
But in the end, what I'll say to you
is that there are people that do both.

38
00:02:26.534 --> 00:02:28.861
One of them is not necessarily winning, so

39
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.490
it's up to you to make a personal
decision of how you feel about it.

40
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.758
But it's worth experimenting with both and
kind of getting familiar with them.
