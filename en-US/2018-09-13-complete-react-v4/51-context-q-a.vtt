00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.930
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Is there a particular
reason why you're calling that context

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.110
instead of state?

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.700
Is it just-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because it is context,

4
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.780
that's what it is.

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.728
It happens to be the state of app but
it doesn't have to be.

6
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:17.330
And searchParams itself
could have state as well.

7
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.800
It doesn't in this case.

8
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.899
So this .state would typically refer
to the state of the actual component,

9
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:23.890
not the context.

10
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.030
I would always call this context.

11
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.040
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Is there any, you
said that searchParams could have state,

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.440
if it did have state and you're injecting
context, is there any conflict?

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.930
I don't know,
it seems almost like cuz they're

14
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.940
both handling-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah.

15
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.730
&gt;&gt; off screen male: State type of thing.

16
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.626
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it is an arrow function,
so you can refer to both of them, right?

17
00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:51.071
This is not, we don't have to use
this in here, this will still

18
00:00:51.071 --> 00:00:55.434
refer to searchParams and searchParams
might have, is this check box checks?

19
00:00:55.434 --> 00:00:59.640
Is this other, what's the active
thing showing at the moment, so

20
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.730
it'll have like more view
state kind of things.

21
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.702
And context will provide two
more app state things, right?

22
00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:09.126
In our case, the app state is
what breeds are we searching for,

23
00:01:09.126 --> 00:01:11.070
what animals are we searching for?

24
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.899
Not necessarily what
thumbnail are we showing,

25
00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.694
what is the active hero image,
right, that's more view state.

26
00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.714
&gt;&gt; off screen male: So its more of
an architectural thing where you,

27
00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:24.629
if you're messing it up is probably
the way you structured it.

28
00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:26.495
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
it's a choice for sure.

29
00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:29.420
They don't tie your hands
behind your back and

30
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.045
say you can't put this thing in context.

31
00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:34.547
You can put whatever you want in context.

32
00:01:34.547 --> 00:01:35.504
It's just a bad idea.

33
00:01:35.504 --> 00:01:36.714
Does that answer your question?

34
00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:37.464
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Yep.

35
00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:39.779
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, other questions?

36
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.472
These are great questions.

37
00:01:43.472 --> 00:01:44.685
&gt;&gt; off screen male: How
do you switch contexts?

38
00:01:47.322 --> 00:01:48.937
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: How do you switch contexts,

39
00:01:48.937 --> 00:01:51.770
as in if you have multiple
consumers in one place?

40
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.010
I'm assuming that's the question,
which it's a good question.

41
00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.875
I'll answer that one.

42
00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:00.920
If it's not, then the person can
clarify and we'll answer that one too.

43
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.100
So assume I had UserContext, right?

44
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.210
We're making this up, we're not gonna code
it, but assume there is UserContext here.

45
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.323
First thing I would do is I would say

46
00:02:13.323 --> 00:02:18.788
Consumer as SearchContext, is as,

47
00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:23.386
and then here as UserContext.

48
00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:25.148
Change this to SearchContext.

49
00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:33.343
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And SearchContext,
and then this would probably,

50
00:02:33.343 --> 00:02:39.020
I would need to change it to
SearchContext or something like that.

51
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.582
Sorry, I said this consumer,
I actually want to call this consumer.

52
00:02:46.674 --> 00:02:49.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's do this.

53
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Same thing here,
UserConsumer, right?

54
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.660
And then outside of that,
you would just have UserConsumer.

55
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.123
And it doesn't matter which one's on
the outside as long as they're both

56
00:03:08.123 --> 00:03:08.887
wrapping it, right?

57
00:03:13.262 --> 00:03:15.973
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then you would have UserContext,

58
00:03:21.652 --> 00:03:22.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so on and so forth.

59
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.250
You kinda get the point here.

60
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.760
So you just kinda keep wrapping them and

61
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.880
then you can refer to
them as different things.

62
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.439
&gt;&gt; off screen male: So wrapping's
just putting it into scope, right?

63
00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.080
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, exactly.

64
00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:35.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hopefully,
I answered that person's question.

65
00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.792
&gt;&gt; off screen male: I guess,
in the situation,

66
00:03:43.792 --> 00:03:48.468
he was talking about if you
had a UserContext that had,

67
00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:54.270
one was an admin, one was a regular
user being able to display.

68
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.700
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure, you would just
handle that like normal state, right?

69
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.190
That's no different than how you
would handle any other piece of data.

70
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.879
What I like about context
is that it's just state.

71
00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.100
Still at the end of it the day,
it's just react state.

72
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.302
In fact, it doesn't even have to be state.

73
00:04:08.302 --> 00:04:10.620
Imagine you were doing a theme, right?

74
00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:18.099
So I would say import Consumer or
as ThemeConsumer.

75
00:04:25.238 --> 00:04:26.480
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I would wrap it around.

76
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.111
And your theme is not changing, right?

77
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:31.700
You make one theme and you use it
throughout your entire web page.

78
00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.193
So instead of having, here in app.js,

79
00:04:35.193 --> 00:04:39.406
instead of saying this
.state I could just say,

80
00:04:39.406 --> 00:04:43.634
assuming this was the one for
the theme, right?

81
00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:47.937
We could just say it's the dark theme,
right, and just pass in static data, and

82
00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:49.410
just read that through it.

83
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.260
It doesn't have to be dynamic, right?

84
00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.138
It might be dynamic, but
if you look at the React docs,

85
00:04:54.138 --> 00:04:55.900
their example is theme, right?

86
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.485
And you would just say, okay,
when this is dark everywhere and so

87
00:04:58.485 --> 00:05:01.830
everyone would read from that dark thing
and then everything would be dark, right?

88
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.966
So this is just props and state, right?

89
00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:10.670
It's just props and state but we're just
kind of using a portal to move it around.

90
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:11.670
It's all context
