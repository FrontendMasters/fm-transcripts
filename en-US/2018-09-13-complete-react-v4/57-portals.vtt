00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're
gonna work on portals.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.940
So we used to have a big
problem with rendering modals.

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.450
In general, it's modals.

4
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.645
Modals in general are just
a problem in my opinion.

5
00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:15.000
[LAUGH] I hate modals.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.750
If you can avoid using modals on
your website, just don't, right?

7
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.660
No one likes modals.

8
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.040
No one like's pop-overs.

9
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.930
They're just an annoying pattern of UI and

10
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.530
I think it's lazy design,
if we're being honest.

11
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.715
I'm still gonna show you how to do it.

12
00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:29.465
[LAUGH] So
if I go in here to Blue, cuz Blue,

13
00:00:29.465 --> 00:00:34.306
he looks like the goodest
boy that should be adopted.

14
00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:39.217
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I wanna put
a button here that says,

15
00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:42.060
are you sure you want to adopt Blue,
right?

16
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.178
And now we're doing a modal on top of
that that I wanted the user to confirm.

17
00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.542
We're not gonna make it work cuz I don't
want to send Pathfinder a bunch of garbage

18
00:00:49.542 --> 00:00:52.493
test responses, but I'm gonna show
you how to make the modal, right?

19
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:57.223
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Before, what we would have
to do is have some sort of root modal or

20
00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.560
component that would render
over the top of things.

21
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.350
It was really, really messy to do it,
models with React previously.

22
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.780
I know what went well is that NetFlix,
we came up with this really complicated

23
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.253
kind of contexty portal pattern
that was ridiculous to maintain.

24
00:01:14.253 --> 00:01:15.510
It was constantly breaking.

25
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.185
With React 16, they came out
with the ability to do portals.

26
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.907
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Portals is basically,
I have something inside of this details

27
00:01:25.907 --> 00:01:30.180
page, but I actually wanna render this
out to a different location, right?

28
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.090
So I'm gonna be rendering
inside of details, but

29
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.520
I want it to actually physically exist
in the DOM in a different place, right,

30
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.490
that's gonna be like a portal.

31
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.836
Which ignore my previous analogy
of portals with context please,

32
00:01:44.836 --> 00:01:48.938
this is a totally separate,
different kind of portal.

33
00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:51.568
[LAUGH] This is terrible because
everything is a context,

34
00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:53.720
everything's a portal, it's ridiculous.

35
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.907
Anyway, I make no apologies.

36
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:02.133
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what I want you to
do is first thing I want you to go into

37
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:03.507
index.html, okay?

38
00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:08.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not much in here.

39
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.180
But I want you to put
another div above the root.

40
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.740
And this one's going to be
called modal like that, line 13.

41
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:24.235
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to render
into this whenever we render a modal.

42
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:33.425
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,
go make a new file called modal.js.

43
00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.617
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops,
I need to make a new one.

44
00:02:38.473 --> 00:02:42.703
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: modal.js
inside your source directory.

45
00:02:45.402 --> 00:02:48.754
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now this code that I'm
about to show you, literally copy and

46
00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:50.340
paste it from the React doc.

47
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.490
So I didn't write this,

48
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.250
this is just the prescribed way that
they show you how to do portals.

49
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.093
So import React from react and

50
00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:04.701
import createPortal from react-dom.

51
00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:15.637
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: const modalRoot equals
document.getElementById modal, right?

52
00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:19.280
So we're actually gonna go grab that
modal that we rented out to the dom.

53
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.767
And then we're gonna make a class
Modal extends React.Component.

54
00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:33.175
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Gonna have
a constructor with props.

55
00:03:35.087 --> 00:03:38.779
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Super props,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

56
00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:43.142
we're gonna say this.el =

57
00:03:43.142 --> 00:03:48.239
document.createElement div.

58
00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.299
So this is the div that we're
going to render into and

59
00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.563
then stick that inside of the modal, okay?

60
00:03:57.563 --> 00:04:04.167
componentDidMount,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna

61
00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:09.542
do modalRoot.appendChild(this.el).

62
00:04:11.368 --> 00:04:16.982
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then when this
unmounts, so componentWillUnmount up here,

63
00:04:16.982 --> 00:04:23.529
you have to go remove it, so you need
to clean up after yourself afterwards.

64
00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:32.440
Yeah, modalRoot.removeChild,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: this.el,

65
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.726
if you don't do this,
you're gonna have memory leaks and

66
00:04:35.726 --> 00:04:38.820
it's going to crash your
browser eventually.

67
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.430
So that's what componentWillUnmount
is almost always for is cleaning

68
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.610
up your memory, removing event listeners,
removing extraneous document stuff.

69
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.155
Anything that's gonna leak memory,

70
00:04:50.155 --> 00:04:52.385
make sure you clean that
up in componentWillUnmount.

71
00:04:54.504 --> 00:04:59.374
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then render, we're going

72
00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:03.870
to just return createPortal

73
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.510
this.props.children this.l.

74
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.053
And then export default Modal.

75
00:05:20.372 --> 00:05:21.195
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is it.

76
00:05:23.763 --> 00:05:24.860
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a lot of space here.

77
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.684
Let's kind of compact
that up a little bit.
