00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.750
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna start by
writing React with no build step

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.020
whatsoever.

3
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.240
I'll be honest, you probably will
never write React like this again.

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.345
But it's really good for you demystify
how React is working behind the scenes.

5
00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:17.211
A lot of people criticize most React
tutorials that they just kind of throw you

6
00:00:17.211 --> 00:00:20.597
off the deep end and say here's
everything already set up for you and

7
00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:23.769
here's a bunch of magic that you
have no idea what it's doing.

8
00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.772
We're gonna peek behind the curtains,
see how everything's working.

9
00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:31.005
And then once you get annoyed
with how it's working,

10
00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:36.479
we're going to put all the nice
convenience layers back on top of it.

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.531
So I'm gonna come in to my terminal here,
and we're gonna make a directory called,

12
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:52.079
I'm just gonna call it Frontend Masters.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

13
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.689
so I have this new directory
called Frontend Masters.

14
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.060
This is gonna be the root of my project.

15
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.767
And the first thing that I'm gonna do is
I'm going to create another directory

16
00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:05.703
called src for source, right?

17
00:01:05.703 --> 00:01:07.900
This is where all my
source files are gonna go.

18
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.440
This isn't necessarily a React thing,

19
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.340
this is how I just choose
to organize my projects.

20
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.860
So I'm gonna make a new
file called index.html.

21
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.710
So now inside of here I
have this one HTML file.

22
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.080
And I'm gonna open this in my editor.

23
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.690
So I'm gonna actually open the whole
directory here in VS Code.

24
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.180
People often accuse me of shilling for
Microsoft because I use VS Code.

25
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.310
I was using VS Code when I was still
at Netflix, this is my favorite editor.

26
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.103
I was a Sublime hardcore user for
a long time.

27
00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.786
I was as TextMate user before that.

28
00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:50.250
But VS Code is just so compelling to use.

29
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.793
So if you're not using VS Code,
I'm going to highly suggest it.

30
00:01:53.793 --> 00:01:57.805
Unless you're using VIM, then you can just
play off in your wonderland with your

31
00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:01.026
magic fingers.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

32
00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:02.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know how to do that

33
00:02:02.676 --> 00:02:03.204
stuff.

34
00:02:03.204 --> 00:02:09.013
Okay, so we're gonna open our
index.html file here, okay?

35
00:02:09.013 --> 00:02:10.901
Right now it's just an empty file.

36
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:13.686
We're going to create an empty shell.

37
00:02:13.686 --> 00:02:17.361
Which there's a thing here called Emmet.

38
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.307
So if I hit html:5 and then hit Tab,

39
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:24.592
it generates the entire
outline of a document for me.

40
00:02:24.592 --> 00:02:29.126
This is just something that
VS Code has included for it,

41
00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:32.410
but everything has bindings for Emmet.

42
00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.527
It's emmet.io, I think, emmet.io.

43
00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:41.537
So if you wanna install that in your
favorite editor, just go to emmet.io.

44
00:02:41.537 --> 00:02:44.092
They'll show you how to do that.

45
00:02:44.092 --> 00:02:45.107
But if you're using VS Code,

46
00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:48.811
it's just built into it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: If you don't feel like

47
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:51.035
installing Emmet, you don't have to.

48
00:02:51.035 --> 00:02:53.572
I don't think I'll really
be using it after this,

49
00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:56.240
so you can just copy what's there.

50
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.750
Today, we are going to be
building a pet adoption app, so

51
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.807
that you can adopt your own pets.

52
00:03:01.807 --> 00:03:05.990
And we're gonna be using real data
from a real API, the Petfinder API.

53
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.067
So we're gonna call our app
whatever you wanna call it.

54
00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.322
I just called mine Adopt Me!

55
00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:13.599
You can call it whatever you want.

56
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.820
True story,
I taught a workshop in Iceland.

57
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.750
This is a US-only API that
we're gonna be using.

58
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.635
But someone, when I was taught this
workshop in Iceland, saw a dog on,

59
00:03:25.635 --> 00:03:27.630
while they were building this application.

60
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.701
Flew to San Franciso, adopted the dog,
and took it back to Iceland.

61
00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:33.972
So I like to say that I saved lives.
