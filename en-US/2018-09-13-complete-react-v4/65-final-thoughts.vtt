00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
congratulations on finishing React.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.847
This was the introduction to React course,
and

3
00:00:06.847 --> 00:00:09.806
you learned the entire
core library of React.

4
00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:12.794
You learned how to build entire
applications using React.

5
00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:14.776
You learned all the life cycle methods.

6
00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:18.653
You learned how to use portals,
contexts, state, props, components,

7
00:00:18.653 --> 00:00:21.740
these are the fundamental
building blocks of using React.

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.820
Again, this is one of my
favorite parts about React,

9
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.270
it's a pretty small core library in
terms of just methods you need to know.

10
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.940
In terms of cognitive load that you
have to keep in your brain about React.

11
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.221
It's just not much more
than what you learned.

12
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:40.028
So from here you can go on and
learn more about testing using Ken scores.

13
00:00:40.028 --> 00:00:44.616
You can go on to my next course which is
gonna be a bunch of intermediate modules

14
00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:48.358
about how to do various other
intermediate things with React,

15
00:00:48.358 --> 00:00:53.390
like integrating Redux or switching out
Preact for react, other things like that.

16
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.610
There's more like advanced patterns,
there's other great courses on friend and

17
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.790
masters about intermediate to
advanced content with React,

18
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.110
so definitely go check that as well.

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.590
But yeah, congratulations.

20
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.551
Congratulations on finishing React.

21
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:15.690
