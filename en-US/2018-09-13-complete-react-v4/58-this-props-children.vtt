&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk a little
bit about this.props.children.

2
00:00:03.141 --> 00:00:07.336
For the most part, on props,
there's nothing really reserved keyword,

3
00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:09.078
you can just pass anything in.

4
00:00:09.078 --> 00:00:12.396
There's two exceptions to this,
as far as I know there might be more, but

5
00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:14.014
there's definitely at least two.

6
00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:19.125
Key, right, key, which we use for
when we're doing maps that

7
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:24.152
do with components to make sure
that they don't do it for you.

8
00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:28.728
Or reorder them that there can be
that performance optimization that we

9
00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:31.026
talked about previously, right?

10
00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:37.003
The other one is children, so if I look
at let's say, go back to app.js just for

11
00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:42.734
a second, inside of Router, notice
that Router opens and closes, right?

12
00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:44.964
So anything that goes inside of Router,

13
00:00:44.964 --> 00:00:47.663
Router can refer to as
this.props.children.

14
00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:51.570
So it's whatever children
components are being passed to it.

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.381
So in this case, we're passing results,
details, and search params.

16
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:58.683
Notice that these don't have any children,
they're self closing tags.

17
00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:03.141
So that's what children is, children
is whatever things were pasded to.

18
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:07.858
So if we go back to modal we're
just rendering out whatever

19
00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:10.374
children are put inside of it.

20
00:01:10.374 --> 00:01:12.167
Cool, so that's what modal is,

21
00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:16.214
it's this ability to render into this
modal route that we grabbed up here.
