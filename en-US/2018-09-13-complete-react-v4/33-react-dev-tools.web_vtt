00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Actually this
might be as good a time as any,

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.764
that I'm gonna show you how
to use the React Dev Tools.

3
00:00:05.764 --> 00:00:12.250
So search for

4
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.170
React Dev Tools and then either Firefox or
Chrome depending what you're using.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.408
Mine is here on the top one.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Go ahead and go and

6
00:00:23.408 --> 00:00:24.230
install this.

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.288
I already think I have it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I

8
00:00:30.288 --> 00:00:34.715
have to have it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, yeah I do.

9
00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:38.263
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

10
00:00:38.263 --> 00:00:43.480
I can come in here and
I can go to my React Dev tools.

11
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.420
These dev tools will only show up
if it detects React on the page.

12
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.970
So it'll hide itself if
there's no React on the page.

13
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.991
Okay and now you can see I have like a,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Well,

14
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:59.983
that's not super helpful.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't

15
00:00:59.983 --> 00:01:04.010
know how to make that any bigger, but
I can assure that says app, right?

16
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.358
So it's actually like a damn explorer for
our React application.

17
00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:10.635
And I go in here and I can see the router.

18
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:14.277
And I go in here and
see all the various locations,

19
00:01:14.277 --> 00:01:17.330
all the components within React router.

20
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.661
But I can eventually get down into, here.

21
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:26.026
The,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Details.

22
00:01:35.903 --> 00:01:37.714
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, it's not letting me,

23
00:01:37.714 --> 00:01:40.612
so it's probably a little
bit hard to see here,

24
00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:45.440
but I can actually see the props
being passed into details, right.

25
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.290
So you can see here that
ID 1 is being passed in.

26
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.692
So if I go in here and
change this to be one, two, three, four,

27
00:01:52.692 --> 00:01:58.535
five.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I inspect element here and

28
00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:03.880
then go back to React.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You

29
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.599
can see the ID is 12345.

30
00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:09.988
It matches whatever is here in the URL.

31
00:02:09.988 --> 00:02:12.034
So that's kinda what's
happening with that colon ID.

32
00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:15.525
It's taking that part of the URL and
passing that in as a prompt.

33
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.965
And you can do this as
many times as you need

34
00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:22.166
to.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is also

35
00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:25.778
super useful for
just finding stuff that you need.

36
00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:28.538
Like you notice that I had to drill
through all these different things,

37
00:02:28.538 --> 00:02:30.659
it's really easy to just say details and
just type it.

38
00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.670
And it'll narrow it down to
whatever you're looking for.

39
00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:37.312
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's super useful.

40
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:40.376
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And notice that I,

41
00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:43.267
actually, could just right-click
on this and Inspect Element,

42
00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:46.390
this takes me into my
Dev Tools on the Firefox side.

43
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.230
But because I have it select
on the Firefox side and

44
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.170
I just go into React, it'll actually take
me directly to that highlighted inside of

45
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.880
the React Dev Tools as well.

46
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.920
So that's super useful.

47
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.220
And lastly, so
I have app here highlighted.

48
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.912
If I go into my console and
say, $r, it'll actually give me

49
00:03:05.912 --> 00:03:10.700
a handle in whatever I have
highlighted in my React Dev Tools.

50
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.452
So if I say, $r.setState,

51
00:03:17.434 --> 00:03:22.065
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: hi: true.

52
00:03:22.065 --> 00:03:26.895
Okay, so I called setState on it,
now if I go back into my React Dev Tools

53
00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:30.531
you can see that I have this
state right here, right?

54
00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:34.627
So I can actually manipulate
React directly through my console

55
00:03:34.627 --> 00:03:39.028
as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now I can mess with

56
00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:43.481
that as much as I want and turn it
true and false, which is fun as well.
