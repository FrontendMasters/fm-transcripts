1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.040
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
now we're gonna make context work, I hope.

2
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.780
So we have context here.

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.120
Where it says this.something,

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.690
we're gonna have to change that to
the context.something cuz it's coming from

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.870
context.

6
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.937
All right, so
context.handleLocationChange.

7
00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:20.715
This.state.location will
be context.location.

8
00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:28.010
This .state.animal will be context,
handleAnimalChange will be context.

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.668
Context, I hope you're
catching a pattern here.

10
00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:35.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Animals, this'll stay
the same cuz coming from the modules.

11
00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:39.169
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Context.breed.

12
00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.259
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm actually just half
tempted to say select all of those,

13
00:00:46.259 --> 00:00:48.787
Cmd+Shift+L, and say context.

14
00:00:52.905 --> 00:00:57.341
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then anywhere that says
this now I can just say Cmd+Shift+L, and

15
00:00:57.341 --> 00:00:58.252
say context.

16
00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:06.162
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I think that's
Ctrl+Shift+L on Windows if I'm not

17
00:01:06.162 --> 00:01:06.970
mistaken.

18
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:09.565
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe not.

19
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.197
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any case, anywhere it says
this.state or this.something, right,

20
00:01:17.197 --> 00:01:22.023
just change that to context.,
cuz that's all coming from context now.

21
00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:27.510
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
as far as I can see here in my notes,

22
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.338
this should work for search box.

23
00:01:30.338 --> 00:01:33.200
But now we have to go make
SearchParams use search box, right?

24
00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:38.758
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So go back to
search box which should now be or

25
00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:42.400
sorry, the SearchParams, the route.

26
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.703
Nothing's in here anymore.

27
00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:46.010
But it'll be really short.

28
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.123
It's gonna be import.

29
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:55.423
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: React from 'react',
and import SearchBox

30
00:01:55.423 --> 00:02:01.921
from './SearchBox'; class SearchParams.

31
00:02:03.711 --> 00:02:09.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Or search-route or
whatever you wanna call it.

32
00:02:12.524 --> 00:02:14.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: extends React.Component.

33
00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:22.057
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we'll put
a render method in here, and return.

34
00:02:28.118 --> 00:02:33.115
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: div
className="search-route", and

35
00:02:33.115 --> 00:02:39.507
we'll put SearchBox with no params,
just like that.

36
00:02:43.241 --> 00:02:50.027
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: At the bottom,
we'll say export default SearchParams.

37
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:57.424
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
here's the magical part about context,

38
00:02:57.424 --> 00:03:00.394
kind of the payoff of
everything that we've done.

39
00:03:00.394 --> 00:03:04.795
We have this SearchParams route
that knows nothing about SearchBox,

40
00:03:04.795 --> 00:03:06.517
it just dumbly renders it.

41
00:03:06.517 --> 00:03:10.447
And yet,
SearchBox is able to interact with App.js

42
00:03:10.447 --> 00:03:13.942
without passing any
data through SearchBox.

43
00:03:13.942 --> 00:03:19.258
We have the self-contained SearchBox
component that we can throw anywhere,

44
00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:19.830
right?

45
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.590
Anywhere that's under the provider and
it's going to read and

46
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.130
write to the provider, and nothing
in the middle has to know about it.

47
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.959
And that's pretty compelling,
that's pretty cool in my opinion.

48
00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.174
But what's hard about that is if
I'm looking for the problem and

49
00:03:34.174 --> 00:03:38.550
I know the problem's in SearchParams.js,
I look at this and I was like,

50
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.899
I have no idea why this isn't working.

51
00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:42.350
Because I can't see any of the data.

52
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.035
Or if I look at App.js,
I know something's messing up, like breed.

53
00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:51.853
But because it's going into
the portal of the provider,

54
00:03:51.853 --> 00:03:54.327
I don't really know what
's modifying it right?

55
00:03:54.327 --> 00:03:57.691
There's some magic going on, and
you can't really see through it,

56
00:03:57.691 --> 00:03:59.377
you kinda have to work backwards.

57
00:03:59.377 --> 00:04:03.573
You have to look for everywhere that
you're bringing in the consumer and

58
00:04:03.573 --> 00:04:05.446
seeing if that's the problem.

59
00:04:05.446 --> 00:04:08.650
So there's danger in using context, right?

60
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.190
You've taken away the explicitness of it.

61
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.878
Let's go check to make sure that I
actually didn't break everything,

62
00:04:13.878 --> 00:04:15.793
which there's a non-trivial
chance that I did that.

63
00:04:18.703 --> 00:04:26.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if I go to SearchParams
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

64
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.057
see, I broke everything, so that's fun.

65
00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:34.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pet finder
is not defined in App.js.

66
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.864
So I did not do this,
const pf = petfinder.

67
00:04:45.132 --> 00:04:52.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: key: process.env.API_KEY,
secret:

68
00:04:56.504 --> 00:05:00.462
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: process.env.API_SECRET.

69
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.491
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this should be
petfinder, all the way around,

70
00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:07.860
petfinder = pf.

71
00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:13.180
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So all I did was this,
right here, yeah.

72
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.398
Because we're using it down here,
in getBreeds().

73
00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:28.462
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, hopefully,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Works again, right?

74
00:05:28.462 --> 00:05:32.253
So now we have this self-contained
search box, still works.

75
00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:38.687
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now, the really powerful
thing that we can do is we can go into

76
00:05:38.687 --> 00:05:44.464
Results.js
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here

77
00:05:44.464 --> 00:05:50.247
in results, and I can just say up here,

78
00:05:50.247 --> 00:05:56.930
import SearchBox from "./SearchBox".

79
00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.902
Then just drop this first thing
under search here, up here,

80
00:06:01.902 --> 00:06:05.003
SearchBox /.

81
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:08.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Guess what?

82
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.940
Because it's all self-contained, because
all the props are coming in via context,

83
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.932
this just works.

84
00:06:18.271 --> 00:06:20.400
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I just import a SearchBox at the top and

85
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.350
added that line right there on 43.

86
00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:27.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To me,
that's compelling, right?

87
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.020
That's a truly reusable component.

88
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.540
I just drop that anywhere and

89
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:34.150
it's doing all this management
of its data behind the scenes.

90
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.056
I don't really have to
worry about that black box.

91
00:06:38.393 --> 00:06:43.157
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For example, React router,
the router that we're using right now,

92
00:06:43.157 --> 00:06:46.234
is using context all over the place,
right?

93
00:06:46.234 --> 00:06:47.300
If you go to the DevTools,

94
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.280
you'll see nine layers of context that
it's using to manage all that stuff.

95
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.582
That's what context is really
powerful is libraries, right?

96
00:06:54.582 --> 00:06:58.054
Libraries that need to connect to each
other through disparate amounts of

97
00:06:58.054 --> 00:06:59.119
application layers.

98
00:07:01.274 --> 00:07:03.657
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
while you may not use context too much,

99
00:07:03.657 --> 00:07:06.188
I invite you to use it
as little as possible.

100
00:07:06.188 --> 00:07:10.967
It's gonna power all of your libraries
that then you would pull in like reach

101
00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:11.572
router.

102
00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:18.298
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if we go to just
slash, notice that we have this up here.

103
00:07:19.884 --> 00:07:20.921
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it's still working.

104
00:07:26.215 --> 00:07:27.638
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Dwarf hamsters.

105
00:07:27.638 --> 00:07:29.375
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
