00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.635
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're getting a form error
here from ESLint just by the fact that I

2
00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:09.540
think we are following good
accessibility practices here, right?

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.945
We have a for, the for
matches this, right?

4
00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:19.498
And then the other thing is that this
select is nestled inside of the,

5
00:00:19.498 --> 00:00:22.102
so this is good accessibility.

6
00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:24.593
A screen reader would totally
be able to read this and yet

7
00:00:24.593 --> 00:00:27.070
ESLint is throwing a fit about it.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.337
They're actually going to deprecate this
rule in the next major release, JSX Ally,

9
00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:33.900
so I'm totally okay just
turning this off for now.

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.989
So what we're gonna do is
open your eslintrc.json, and

11
00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.870
we're gonna add another rule here.

12
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.845
So just to show you how I
found the name of this.

13
00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.012
The easiest way to do this is if
you go back to search parameters.

14
00:00:48.012 --> 00:00:53.039
If I hover on this you can down here, this
right here, that's the name of the rule.

15
00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.526
Jsx-ally/label-has-for, or
if I'm in the command line,

16
00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:07.075
and I say, npm run lint
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,

17
00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:10.740
it's this one right here,
this little gray thing at the end.

18
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.052
So I just copy and paste this, copy.

19
00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:17.770
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I copied that.

20
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.070
I'm going to use JSON.

21
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.159
I'm going to go into rules and
I'm just going to paste that here.

22
00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.899
And if I put it as zero
it turns it off totally.

23
00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.190
If I put it as a 1, it's warns,
and if I put it as a 2, it errors,

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.310
which is what it is on right now.

25
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.146
So I'm just gonna turn it off because
we're gonna handle this ourselves, right?

26
00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:42.085
Another thing that's been,
we're gonna use some more consoles.

27
00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.263
I get annoyed when it tells
me not to console log.

28
00:01:44.263 --> 00:01:46.106
So I'm just gonna put no console.

29
00:01:48.112 --> 00:01:50.416
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm gonna make it
a warning instead of an error,

30
00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:52.340
cuz sometimes I do wanna console.log.
