00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now what I wanna do is,

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.860
this is kinda burdensome to go to the
command line to have to go format it, so

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.350
I can actually make my editor do it
every time that I save the file.

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.050
So let's go do that first.

5
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.320
So like I said, there is a way
you can configure Prettier to

6
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.990
have different line lengths, or should I
use just double quotes or single quotes.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.350
I just use the default configuration
cuz I don't really wanna

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.030
think about what
configuration that I want.

9
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.990
So I'm just gonna say control, and
I'm gonna hit make a new file here.

10
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.730
I'm gonna save this at
the root of my FEM directory.

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.974
Not in source, inside of this one.

12
00:00:38.974 --> 00:00:41.715
At the same level as package.json, right?

13
00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:44.815
And I'm gonna call it

14
00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:51.944
.prettierrc.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's gonna say, don't use

15
00:00:51.944 --> 00:00:56.212
dot and you're gonna say, I wanna use dot.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

16
00:00:56.212 --> 00:00:59.200
this is where you can configure Prettier,
right?

17
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.291
And I'm just gonna make
it an empty object.

18
00:01:03.291 --> 00:01:03.995
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you and

19
00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:06.814
source would be great.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Root, yeah,

20
00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:08.410
the root directory.

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.670
Why empty object?

22
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.180
Because I'm just using all
the default configuration.

23
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.550
Now you might ask,
why do you even need this file then?

24
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.110
Because now, my VS code is gonna see
that I have a prettierrc file and

25
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.180
it's gonna say this is a Prettier project.

26
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.318
And it's gonna start
autoformatting everything,

27
00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:33.434
all the time.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, if you're on VS code,

28
00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:37.172
you'll have to install the extension for
Prettier.

29
00:01:37.172 --> 00:01:40.130
If you just come here on the side,
you type in prettier.

30
00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:46.706
I already have it installed up here,
but it's this one that you want,

31
00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:55.288
the one that has 3.7 million downloads.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think it's prettier.io.

32
00:01:55.288 --> 00:02:04.064
prettier.io.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see here

33
00:02:04.064 --> 00:02:08.516
that they have all the extensions down
here if you're using a different editor,

34
00:02:08.516 --> 00:02:10.688
so just go ahead and grab it from there.

35
00:02:10.688 --> 00:02:11.712
It works in,

36
00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:17.816
as far as I know all major editors.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

37
00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:22.700
and then now, now that I have that,
I'm gonna look at my settings now.

38
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.155
And, right here this is what I,

39
00:02:30.155 --> 00:02:33.320
prettier.requireConfig.

40
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.020
This is my favorite setting.

41
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.670
It just says if it has a prettier RC file,
run formatting.

42
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.654
If it doesn't have a prettier RC file,
like if you're working another project

43
00:02:42.654 --> 00:02:46.170
that doesn't have prettier,
you don't wanna change all the lines.

44
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.704
Then it won't do that.

45
00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:54.123
So that here you wanna say
prettier.requireConfig, true.

46
00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:57.641
You do need formatOnSave up here.

47
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.711
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because VS

48
00:03:06.711 --> 00:03:10.400
code has multiple kinds of formatter
like Go Format, for example.

49
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.000
So this is just telling you that
every time that you run, you save.

50
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.069
I want you to run whatever
formatter is available.

51
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.280
That's true.

52
00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.870
So now if I come into app.js,
and I wreck all

53
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.920
of the formatting again and
I just save, it just fixes it for me.

54
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.789
Which is pretty cool, right?

55
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.160
So now if you see stuff like flying
around on my page and getting shift and

56
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.350
all this kind of stuff, it's cuz
Prettier is running in the background.
