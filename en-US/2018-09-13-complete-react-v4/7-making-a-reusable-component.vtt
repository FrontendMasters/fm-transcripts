1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now that we have an app,

2
00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.640
let's go actually make some sort of
reusable component that we're gonna use

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.890
multiple times here.

4
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.400
So the next thing I want you to do now,

5
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.560
is I want you to move this into
a separate JavaScript file cuz this is

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.910
gonna get really messy putting
everything inside of a script tag.

7
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.725
So what I'm gonna do here
is I'm just going to,

8
00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:22.359
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cut and paste that.

9
00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.472
So I'm gonna make a new file,
always in source, right, here.

10
00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:34.600
And I'm just gonna call it App.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Stop it,

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.866
I don't care.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

12
00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:45.170
now I have something called App.js,
same code and everything like that.

13
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.264
Here in index.html,
rather than have the script tag here,

14
00:00:51.264 --> 00:00:54.251
I'm just gonna say here src =

15
00:00:54.251 --> 00:01:01.443
./App.js.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

16
00:01:01.443 --> 00:01:03.338
just added line 16 there, right?

17
00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:05.647
Deleted all the code inside of that,

18
00:01:05.647 --> 00:01:10.500
moved them to another file called
./App.js in the same source directory.

19
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.919
And then we can just start writing stuff
in the JavaScript file rather than kind

20
00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:20.465
of having the HTML and
CSS evolve in the same

21
00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:26.906
page.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

22
00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:29.874
if I save that and go check,
this should still work, right?

23
00:01:29.874 --> 00:01:34.712
Cuz it's still loading
that JavaScript file.

24
00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:38.679
Now I wanna have a pet sort of component,
right?

25
00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.400
So that it can render out pets
inside of my applications.

26
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.622
So I'm gonna make another
component above this called pet.

27
00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:51.434
const Pet = arrow ().

28
00:01:51.434 --> 00:01:56.329
Okay and it's gonna be the same sort of
thing where I'm gonna return the result

29
00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.146
of React.createelement.

30
00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:05.970
And I'm gonna put this inside of a "div".
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But

31
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.595
instead of just returning
one child inside of this,

32
00:02:08.595 --> 00:02:11.195
I'm going to return an array of children,
right?

33
00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:15.644
Cuz it's gonna have multiple children.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

34
00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:21.486
first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna have what kind of dog,

35
00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:24.249
or what's the dog's name?

36
00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:30.888
So it's gonna be react.createElement,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: h1,

37
00:02:30.888 --> 00:02:35.443
empty and the name of the dog,
which we're gonna do my dog, so

38
00:02:35.443 --> 00:02:39.869
it's gonna be Luna.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, underneath that,

39
00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:44.898
we're gonna have another createElement
called, that's going to be an h2.

40
00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:49.413
And Luna is a dog.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And underneath that,

41
00:02:49.413 --> 00:02:54.050
we're gonna have another one and
she is a Havanese dog.

42
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.748
But you could have Poodle or

43
00:02:56.748 --> 00:03:01.575
whatever you want there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sure you have

44
00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:03.839
the commas here, right?

45
00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.338
Cuz it is an array.

46
00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:19.205
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we have a new
pet class, a new pet component, right?

47
00:03:19.205 --> 00:03:22.615
So you wanna use this pet inside of our

48
00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:27.351
application.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

49
00:03:27.351 --> 00:03:32.222
we're gonna go down into app.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna turn this into

50
00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:37.810
an array as well.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

51
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.500
now underneath this we're gonna add
three instances of the pet class.

52
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.419
So I'm gonna say react,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .createElement(Pet),

53
00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.013
and I'm just gonna put three of these.

54
00:04:03.827 --> 00:04:04.364
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again,

55
00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:08.619
I've made this pet rubber stamp and I've
now stamped pet three times inside of app.

56
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.400
So what do you expect to see when
we go over to look at the browser?

57
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.400
You expect to see a div on the outside.

58
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.860
You expect to see an h1 with
Adopt me inside of it, right?

59
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.980
And then you expect to see three of
these pet components right in a row.

60
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.788
So you're going to see Luna,
Dog, Havanese,

61
00:04:29.788 --> 00:04:35.531
three separate times.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So we see three Lunas there?

62
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:36.572
Or we see-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Three

63
00:04:36.572 --> 00:04:37.173
Lunas.

64
00:04:37.173 --> 00:04:37.723
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, exactly.

65
00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:38.332
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, [LAUGH]

66
00:04:38.332 --> 00:04:41.173
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Exactly, so you can see

67
00:04:41.173 --> 00:04:48.750
here, Luna shows up three times.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Make sense?

68
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.223
Cool, good question.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

69
00:04:52.223 --> 00:04:55.420
now we've kind of stamped this
multiple times onto our page.

70
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.620
Again, you're probably thinking,

71
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.846
this isn't a super useful pet component
cuz it describes one pet, right?

72
00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:04.450
I don't wanna write this
component 100 times for

73
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.879
100 different pets, which again,
is a fair assertion.

74
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.780
So, now we're gonna start getting
into how reactions become a little

75
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.230
bit more powerful, because we can
make these components more flexible.

76
00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.600
Last thing is, if you're looking at your
console, you will be seeing these errors.

77
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.100
We will fix these.

78
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.973
Just for now if you see key prop errors,
just ignore them,

79
00:05:29.973 --> 00:05:31.723
we will come back to them.
