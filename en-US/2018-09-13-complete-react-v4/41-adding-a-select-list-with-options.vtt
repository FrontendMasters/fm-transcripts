00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go ahead and
go make animal change now work.

2
00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:11.140
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we'll do handleAnimalChange up here.

3
00:00:16.327 --> 00:00:16.827
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: this.setState.

4
00:00:23.054 --> 00:00:30.023
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: To be
animal:event.target.value.

5
00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:36.849
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a predefined
list of acceptable animal

6
00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:40.063
parameters to provide
to the pet finder API.

7
00:00:40.063 --> 00:00:44.175
It's an unchanging static list of ten
different animal types like cats, birds,

8
00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:45.136
dogs, barnyard.

9
00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:47.142
There's a couple of them, right.

10
00:00:47.142 --> 00:00:51.193
And I've actually just stowed this
away inside of pet finders so

11
00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:55.933
you can actually just pull it straight
out of the pet finder client for you.

12
00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.999
So let's go ahead and do that now.

13
00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:04.553
In general the way I would do it is I
would say const animals = animals, right,

14
00:01:04.553 --> 00:01:11.628
and it's actually smart enough to go auto
import this from pet finder client again.

15
00:01:11.628 --> 00:01:16.289
But let's go write it up there so
you know how I got it in here.

16
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.993
So import, and
then I'm gonna put curly braces here,

17
00:01:24.993 --> 00:01:31.302
animals like this, from petfinder-client.

18
00:01:31.302 --> 00:01:34.605
This is a array of strings, as you can
see right here, and it's just a bunch

19
00:01:34.605 --> 00:01:37.719
of different animal types that
are coming from the petfinder client.

20
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.860
Again, this isn't technically
destructuring, but it looks and

21
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.690
functions like destructuring.

22
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.230
We're just pulling the animals named
export out of petfinder client.

23
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.640
That's what that's actually doing.

24
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.030
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So under our input
down here, so under this label,

25
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.675
we're gonna put another label,
label for htmlFor, rather.

26
00:02:05.206 --> 00:02:12.600
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Animal,
this again will be Animal, like this.

27
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.340
And we're going to make a select.

28
00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:20.056
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: id=animal.

29
00:02:22.384 --> 00:02:27.564
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Value=this.state.animal.

30
00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:36.941
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: onChange,
this.handleAnimalChange.

31
00:02:40.332 --> 00:02:44.549
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
I'm pretty sure that if I try and

32
00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.480
close this without a blur change, yeah.

33
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.414
So if you have onChange,
you'll also have to have onBlur.

34
00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:02.545
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Otherwise it's not
accessible because you can technically go

35
00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:07.172
through, change something with a keyboard,
and then tab away from it, and

36
00:03:07.172 --> 00:03:10.670
it wouldn't technically change a,
cause an onChange.

37
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.340
So that's why you have an onBlur as well,

38
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.360
to double make sure that every
device works with these selects.

39
00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:24.698
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, the first thing that
I want on here is just an empty thing,

40
00:03:24.698 --> 00:03:28.700
right, like an empty option that
reflects having nothing selected, right.

41
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.060
So they can choose no animal,
which is show me all of the animals.

42
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.030
So the way you can do that is just put
an empty option up here, like that.

43
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.900
Or as Prettier will make me do it,
it'll just condense it down to that.

44
00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.670
So even if I try and

45
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.300
do that, Prettier will just automatically
condense that down to that.

46
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.845
Animals, this is just an array of strings,
so we're gonna say ANIMALS.map

47
00:03:55.988 --> 00:03:57.808
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Animal, and

48
00:03:57.808 --> 00:04:02.902
we will implicitly return here.

49
00:04:02.902 --> 00:04:09.014
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Option.key =animal.

50
00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:12.275
Value=animal.

51
00:04:12.275 --> 00:04:14.838
And the string is animal.

52
00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:16.300
So we use animal three times.

53
00:04:23.535 --> 00:04:26.343
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Key because you need some
sort of key so that React, anytime that

54
00:04:26.343 --> 00:04:30.730
you're doing a map, you just have to
give it a key, that's just how it works.

55
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.790
Value is that's what's actually going
to be saved in your state if someone

56
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.810
selects it.

57
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.560
And then we actually want to show them a
good display name, so we show them animal.

58
00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:44.920
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is
how that ends up looking.

59
00:04:55.256 --> 00:04:55.756
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good?

60
00:04:58.178 --> 00:04:59.412
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
now we should be able to select an animal.

61
00:05:04.063 --> 00:05:05.895
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I probably need
to change that back to ping.

62
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.860
This should just be location on line 24,
location.

63
00:05:13.993 --> 00:05:16.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now I have Seattle, Washington up here.

64
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.660
But now I also have a list of
animals that I can choose what

65
00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.890
kind of animal I wanna search for.

66
00:05:24.658 --> 00:05:26.629
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can search for
small furry animals.

67
00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.875
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Typically I'd want to have
better display names for this, but for

68
00:05:31.875 --> 00:05:32.610
now this works.

69
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.600
This is actually what you
have to send to the API.

70
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.408
You have to send small furry or
it does not recognize it.

71
00:05:41.672 --> 00:05:42.172
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay.

72
00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.758
&gt;&gt; Student: So
when you select the animal right now,

73
00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:01.540
does it populate into your field?

74
00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.499
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so
that's a good question.

75
00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:09.553
So let's actually just open our dev tools,

76
00:06:09.553 --> 00:06:15.027
I think that's the easiest
way to show it here.

77
00:06:15.027 --> 00:06:18.877
Dev tools,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

78
00:06:18.877 --> 00:06:22.810
then go to React,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

79
00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.010
we go to searchParams, right.

80
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.800
So you can see here,
animal is blank right now.

81
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.980
If I select a dog,
you can see that it updates to dog.

82
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.316
Or smallFurry, or I could even come
in here and change it to cat, and

83
00:06:37.316 --> 00:06:38.817
it changes it over there.
