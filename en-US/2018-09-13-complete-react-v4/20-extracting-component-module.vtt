00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; Brian: So
we have pet in here right now.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.250
We're gonna move this
into a separate module.

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.410
So what's actually really cool
here is I have this light bulb

4
00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.470
that comes up from VS code.

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.360
So I just highlight,
I wanna move this into a new file, right?

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.022
So I highlight this lightbulb right
there and I say move to a new file.

7
00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:29.216
&gt;&gt; Brian: And then it just
automatically builds me a pad.js here,

8
00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:32.200
it imports react from react and
it exports that for me.

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How did you do that?

10
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.790
&gt;&gt; Brian: So I highlighted what I wanted
to export, just bring it back in here.

11
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.240
Highlighted what I wanted to export,
it brings up this lightbulb,

12
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.790
it's kind of hard to see right there,
right?

13
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.120
And there's a couple things that you
can do, but I said, move to a new file.

14
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And Parcel's doing this,
or Visual Studio Code?

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.978
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's VS Code, yeah,
which magical tool am I using this time?

16
00:01:05.978 --> 00:01:10.085
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian: That's pretty damn cool

17
00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:10.750
too, right?

18
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're asking if you're
David Copperfield field of code.

19
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.070
&gt;&gt; Brian: I mean in the hacky sense that

20
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.750
I'm stealing everyone else's cool
stuff and passing it off as my own?

21
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:22.250
Yeah, sure.

22
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510
So, I prefer to do it a little
bit differently, this way.

23
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:36.633
Const pet and then I'm going to say
at the bottom: export default pet.

24
00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:48.258
&gt;&gt; Brian: Okay, so now again.

25
00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:49.787
You do have to come up here.

26
00:01:53.024 --> 00:01:55.574
&gt;&gt; Brian: You'll have to take these
curly braces off cuz it wants to do

27
00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:57.160
a named import.

28
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.031
And I want it to be a default export.

29
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:01.730
That's all you have to do.

30
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.500
So now,
we are making our own modules, right?

31
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.510
Now we have a app
component in its own file,

32
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.720
we have a pet component in its own file,
and they're separate.

33
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.120
The nice thing about Parcel is it'll
stitch all that stuff together for

34
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.430
you automatically.

35
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.950
Don't have to worry about it.

36
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.920
So now if we come back over here,
just everything still works, but

37
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.530
now it's stitching
together multiple files.

38
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350
So to talk about alternatives
that you could be using here,

39
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.130
I did talk about Webpack a little bit.

40
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.700
Definitely look into Webpack,
it's still a great piece of technology.

41
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:40.178
The other one is Browser Fi, written by
another Frontend Master substack, James.

42
00:02:40.178 --> 00:02:41.374
What's James' last name?

43
00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:41.923
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Halliday.

44
00:02:41.923 --> 00:02:43.743
&gt;&gt; Brian: Halliday.

45
00:02:43.743 --> 00:02:45.400
Really smart guy.

46
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.100
I use Browser 5 forever.

47
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.150
The nice thing about Browser 5 is it's
really easy to write plug-ins for us.

48
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.230
So when I was working in Netflix,
we used the Browser 5 quite a bit.

49
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.910
So another good piece of technology that
you could definitely sub in here and

50
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.810
it work as well.

51
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.050
Yeah?
No, I think we finished doing Parcel.

52
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.305
We finished doing ES,
kind of the tooling part of this.

53
00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:11.660
So you may not have to do this
kind of stuff all the time.

54
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.070
You may already have a project that's
set up with all the tooling and such.

55
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.350
But I wanted to show you how to
set up your own project youRself.

56
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.560
From here on out,

57
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.630
basically we have the entire project
set-up to have a real react project.

58
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.110
So we'll continue from
this point doing that.

59
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.470
The next thing we're going to talk
about is something called JSX.
