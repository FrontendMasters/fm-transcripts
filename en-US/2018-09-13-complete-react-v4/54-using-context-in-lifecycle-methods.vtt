1
00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:03.710
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going
to make results now,

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.717
because we're storing all
these search params, right?

3
00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:12.199
But we're not doing anything with them,
right?

4
00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.101
We actually wanna be able
to use these to search.

5
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:19.868
So, let's go to results and
we're going to,

6
00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:24.880
import the consumer here as well, import

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.880
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: consumer from

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.218
./searchContext.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.995
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we have a problem here.

10
00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:45.462
I wanna use here in component
amount I wanna be able

11
00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:50.420
to put in here, animal: context.animal.

12
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.756
I wanna be able to read from context
inside of the life cycle methods, but

13
00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:58.826
what I have shown you so far only
works in the render method, right?

14
00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:03.118
So we're kinda at this impasse where I'm
only have context available in render and

15
00:01:03.118 --> 00:01:05.891
I don't have it available
on the life cycle methods.

16
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:06.922
It's a problem right?

17
00:01:06.922 --> 00:01:10.044
I wanna use it here in component amount.

18
00:01:10.044 --> 00:01:12.438
So how do I do that?

19
00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.593
Well, the good news is that you already
have all the tools how to do it,

20
00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:18.180
you just need to think about
it a little bit differently.

21
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.886
What we're gonna do down here is we've
made this entire results component,

22
00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:28.976
but we're going to wrap the thing
that we export with the consumer and

23
00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:31.631
then pass it in as props to results.

24
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:36.799
So, I'm gonna go down here,
export default,

25
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.841
and rather than just
export results naked I'm

26
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:48.061
gonna say default function
ResultsWithContextprops.

27
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:54.894
And then IÂ´m just going to wrap the result
with context and pass it in as props.

28
00:01:54.894 --> 00:01:59.061
So return consumer.

29
00:02:05.618 --> 00:02:07.158
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then this is just gonna

30
00:02:07.158 --> 00:02:12.695
be a function here context.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Results,

31
00:02:16.393 --> 00:02:18.687
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's two things I'm

32
00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:24.780
actually gonna use this spread
operator here, ...props like this.

33
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.370
Typically, I don't like,

34
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.089
I told you this spread operator
which we talked about previously.

35
00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:34.343
But in this case I'm okay with it because
all of these props were going to result

36
00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:37.185
anyway, result is already
expecting these props.

37
00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:40.971
And the props that you're getting,
it's getting props from react router or

38
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:42.966
from reach router being passed into it.

39
00:02:42.966 --> 00:02:45.193
So you wanna just not impede that.

40
00:02:45.193 --> 00:02:47.043
We're just gonna pass those
along untouched, right?

41
00:02:47.043 --> 00:02:51.105
So in this case, this is what
the spread operator is made for.

42
00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:52.094
This is when it's useful.

43
00:02:52.094 --> 00:02:57.292
This is when you should use it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

44
00:02:57.292 --> 00:03:00.900
And then after that,
I'm gonna searchParams =

45
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.361
context.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now inside of

46
00:03:06.361 --> 00:03:12.966
results we will have the context available
by wrapping it with this function.

47
00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:16.563
Now you might ask why are you
using an error function here or

48
00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:18.552
any sort of function like that.

49
00:03:18.552 --> 00:03:22.649
The reason why in this particular case
I would admonish you to use a normal

50
00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:27.421
function like this is because now I have
this component called result with context,

51
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:30.604
and this will show up in the call
stack if I have an error.

52
00:03:30.604 --> 00:03:34.867
So this makes it a little bit more verbose
so that I can actually see results with

53
00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:38.370
context in my call stack which
makes it easier to debug, right?

54
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.971
I have a named function
which is important,

55
00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:46.749
does that makes sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

56
00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:52.116
so now I have this ability
to read from context

57
00:03:52.116 --> 00:03:56.933
inside of here just by looking at props.

58
00:03:56.933 --> 00:03:59.948
So let's go make that work.

59
00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.742
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So here I'm gonna say,

60
00:04:07.742 --> 00:04:12.185
instead of location I'm gonna say,

61
00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:18.972
this.props.searchParams.location.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All

62
00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:21.917
right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm also gonna

63
00:04:21.917 --> 00:04:24.738
add the rest of my
parameters in here as well.

64
00:04:24.738 --> 00:04:30.565
So just, animal,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: this.

65
00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:36.296
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Props.search params.animal,

66
00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:40.601
let's just make that
a multiple lines here.

67
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:45.461
Last one we're gonna have breed

68
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:51.222
this.props.search Params.breed

69
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:05.732
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now this'll read
directly from our context and

70
00:05:05.732 --> 00:05:11.138
use that for the actual search results.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're

71
00:05:11.138 --> 00:05:12.125
still not all the way there yet.

72
00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.756
We've made componentDidMount work, but

73
00:05:13.756 --> 00:05:16.071
we wanna be able to actually
search multiple times, right?

74
00:05:16.071 --> 00:05:19.105
This only searches when
the component mounts and

75
00:05:19.105 --> 00:05:22.660
it doesn't do any more searching,
so how do we fix that?

76
00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.150
Just make it another method, right?

77
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.490
Instead of calling this componentDidMount,
why don't we just call it search?

78
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.336
And then well make another
componentDidMount in here.

79
00:05:34.336 --> 00:05:37.326
And inside of componentDidMount
we'll just call

80
00:05:37.326 --> 00:05:42.137
this.search.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now we

81
00:05:42.137 --> 00:05:46.866
have a search method and we can make it
any time that we click that Submit button,

82
00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:53.933
that it'll just do a search, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

83
00:05:53.933 --> 00:05:57.980
actually, we're gonna pass
this into our search box, so

84
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:03.855
the way we're gonna do that is we're just
gonna make this an arrow function as well.

85
00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:07.985
Cuz this is gonna call
this.props everywhere, right?

86
00:06:07.985 --> 00:06:09.277
Which is so we need to do that

87
00:06:22.835 --> 00:06:23.512
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so

88
00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:25.723
we now have the search method.

89
00:06:25.723 --> 00:06:29.052
I'm gonna go down to my search box.

90
00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:31.124
Where is my search box, right there.

91
00:06:31.124 --> 00:06:35.973
I'm gonna give it one parameter,
search which is

92
00:06:35.973 --> 00:06:41.000
gonna be equal to this.search.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

93
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:47.042
now this is gonna be passed
into the search box.

94
00:06:47.042 --> 00:06:49.318
If we go to searchbox.js

95
00:06:54.473 --> 00:06:57.057
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're gonna go down to

96
00:06:57.057 --> 00:07:02.090
the button, and we're gonna say onClick =

97
00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:09.321
this.props.search.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

98
00:07:09.321 --> 00:07:12.370
actually we can even make
this a little better.

99
00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.683
Let's just wrap it in a form.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We'll

100
00:07:17.683 --> 00:07:22.931
get rid of this right here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

101
00:07:22.931 --> 00:07:27.463
above.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

102
00:07:27.463 --> 00:07:29.926
I did this inside of the div.

103
00:07:29.926 --> 00:07:34.903
Here, form and we'll do

104
00:07:34.903 --> 00:07:43.198
onSubmit=[this.props.search].

105
00:07:43.198 --> 00:07:45.120
So now this will cover two cases,

106
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.220
if they hit Enter on it it
will actually do the search.

107
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.765
And if they hit the Submit button,

108
00:07:49.765 --> 00:07:53.181
hit the [INAUDIBLE] button they don't
give a type to it it's a submit button.

109
00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:55.233
So it will actually
submit the form as well.

110
00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:58.347
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Except you have to

111
00:07:58.347 --> 00:07:59.060
handle that.

112
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:02.118
So let's actually do this,
handleFormSubmit.

113
00:08:02.118 --> 00:08:08.128
Sorry, this is in my notes, so
I'm improvising this little bit.

114
00:08:08.128 --> 00:08:14.026
this., this is gonna take an event.

115
00:08:14.026 --> 00:08:15.116
And in the event,

116
00:08:15.116 --> 00:08:20.298
you're gonna have to do preventDefault.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Otherwise, the form

117
00:08:20.298 --> 00:08:25.658
will actually try and submit, right?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you can say,

118
00:08:25.658 --> 00:08:31.464
this.props.search.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then here,

119
00:08:31.464 --> 00:08:36.086
instead of saying this.props.seach,
you will say HandleFormSubmit.

120
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:44.032
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is a little

121
00:08:44.032 --> 00:08:44.641
bit more robust.

122
00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:45.953
This is probably how you should do it,

123
00:08:45.953 --> 00:08:51.056
which is why I'm showing it to you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz now we'll handle

124
00:08:51.056 --> 00:08:56.787
multiple different cases.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Here I'm using

125
00:08:56.787 --> 00:09:00.766
consumer inside of the render method, and
I'm not making a new component down here.

126
00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:04.772
I just export the false search
params as opposed to search

127
00:09:04.772 --> 00:09:09.635
box.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I still call these

128
00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:14.047
both search params, yeah don't do that,
call the other one a search box, sorry.

129
00:09:14.047 --> 00:09:20.336
That's just for debugging purposes.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

130
00:09:20.336 --> 00:09:23.657
here I'm doing it this way and
then in results,

131
00:09:23.657 --> 00:09:28.989
if you come down here I'm exporting
a function which the consumer wraps it.

132
00:09:28.989 --> 00:09:33.151
Here's the reason why I choose to
it this way I think in general

133
00:09:33.151 --> 00:09:37.806
this is more explicit and I prefer
this when you can possibly do this.

134
00:09:37.806 --> 00:09:41.876
So if you only have to reference
context inside of the render,

135
00:09:41.876 --> 00:09:46.042
that's the only place that you need it,
you can do it this way.

136
00:09:46.042 --> 00:09:49.681
In this particular case context
is only used here in the render.

137
00:09:49.681 --> 00:09:54.590
We're just doing event listeners and
we're reading from it, but

138
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.745
here in results.js, we need it on props so

139
00:09:57.745 --> 00:10:03.723
that we can reference it inside of search,
and in inside of componentDidMount.

140
00:10:03.723 --> 00:10:08.637
If you need to reference it inside of
the life cycle methods you have to

141
00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:09.750
do it this way.

142
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.374
Okay, let me make sure this works.

143
00:10:14.374 --> 00:10:16.995
So now if I say dog and I hit Submit,

144
00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:22.070
I guess I was already looking at dogs,
that's not super helpful.

145
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.306
Let's look at Havanese and

146
00:10:26.306 --> 00:10:31.102
say Submit, cool.

147
00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:37.240
We're back and I'm gonna show you how
to fix what was the problem before.

148
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.142
What happened previously is some of
the data was coming back from the API

149
00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:41.866
corrupted.

150
00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:46.531
It was incomplete and
in this particular case it wasn't

151
00:10:46.531 --> 00:10:50.511
including photos which
meant here in pet.js.

152
00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:54.486
This call right here to
where I was calling photos,

153
00:10:54.486 --> 00:11:00.896
this is what it was before photos,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 0.value,

154
00:11:00.896 --> 00:11:04.767
and this photo 0 was undefined.

155
00:11:04.767 --> 00:11:09.000
Which meant that this value was
trying to access a property on

156
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.903
an undefined property which
is not good [LAUGH], right?

157
00:11:12.903 --> 00:11:17.210
So we went ahead and
fixed this by doing, let's see,

158
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:22.209
this line right here, line 14,
const hero image, right?

159
00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:28.593
If photo images, a photo zero exists,
then make it photos zero.value.

160
00:11:28.593 --> 00:11:33.094
If it doesn't exist, then we're just
using a place holder image, this is from

161
00:11:33.094 --> 00:11:37.943
placecorgi.com which is literally one of
my favorite websites in the entire world.

162
00:11:37.943 --> 00:11:40.646
Just to show you what this is,
I'll click on that.

163
00:11:40.646 --> 00:11:43.121
It's an adorable dog.

164
00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:43.991
Is anyone upset by this?

165
00:11:43.991 --> 00:11:44.801
No.

166
00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:47.561
Because it's a corgi and they're adorable.

167
00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:51.560
So in order to replace that, in fact
you can see here I was looking this one

168
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.588
right here, Coco,
was the one that was messing it up.

169
00:11:54.588 --> 00:11:59.899
So that's what we did here, if photos[0]
exists then use the value from

170
00:11:59.899 --> 00:12:06.397
that otherwise use the place holder.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

171
00:12:06.397 --> 00:12:11.705
then here you just take that,
this hero image, and let's put that here

172
00:12:11.705 --> 00:12:18.125
instead
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Makes

173
00:12:18.125 --> 00:12:23.938
sense?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

174
00:12:23.938 --> 00:12:30.230
now, to kind of re-demonstrate
the search working,

175
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:35.696
I can put a bird here,
I can put an African Grey,

176
00:12:35.696 --> 00:12:43.385
and we'll put this in
San Francisco California, and hit Submit.

177
00:12:43.385 --> 00:12:48.769
And you should see a bunch of African
Greys which are almost all in Utah,

178
00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:49.954
that's cool.
