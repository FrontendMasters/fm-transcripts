00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.414
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna save that,
we have this index.html file, right?

2
00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:08.604
So I'm gonna head over
to my favorite browser,

3
00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:14.149
which happens to be Firefox,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I'm going to open this.

4
00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:21.290
So if you're on a Mac, you can hit File
&gt; Open &gt; Open File right here, or Cmd+O.

5
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.990
Okay, so let's do that.

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.544
We're gonna open this with,
I put it in temp,

7
00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:34.764
I think, fem &gt; src &gt; index.html.

8
00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:41.540
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can see here,
I see not rendered.

9
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.470
Which is what we expect, right?

10
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.474
We actually haven't put any
code on the page yet, so

11
00:00:45.474 --> 00:00:47.530
this is what we expect to see so far.

12
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.490
Okay, last thing here
that I want you to do is,

13
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.544
we're going to, I wrote all the CSS for
this project, so that you do not have to.

14
00:00:58.544 --> 00:00:59.877
You're welcome.

15
00:00:59.877 --> 00:01:03.080
[LAUGH] This is definitely
not a CSS workshop.

16
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.489
There are other Frontend Masters courses
that are from people like Estelle that

17
00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:09.960
know CSS way, way better than I do.

18
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.570
So listen to them, don't listen to me.

19
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.438
But if you come back to our website here,
you can see where it says,

20
00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:19.590
Download it here.

21
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.710
If I open that, you can see here,
it's just a lot of CSS.

22
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.900
So I'm just gonna Cmd+S, save that
file into my same source directory.

23
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.660
So let's find temp again.

24
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.937
fem &gt; src, so in the src directory,
I'm gonna save this style.css file.

25
00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.970
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now I'm
gonna go back over to my editor, and

26
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.073
I am just going to put a link
tag here in the head, link.

27
00:01:56.375 --> 00:02:01.191
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then,
I'm going to put ./style.css.

28
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.562
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again,
I can Cmd-click on that.

29
00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:12.855
It'll open it so I can,
that's the correct path.

30
00:02:18.193 --> 00:02:20.192
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we just added this one right here.

31
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:22.993
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Probably
makes it harder to read.

32
00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:27.320
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, cool.

33
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.927
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now if we go
back over to the Adopt Me page,

34
00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:37.087
your background should be red.

35
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.313
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But you can still
see up here, it's really small, but

36
00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:43.940
it says not rendered in the top left.

37
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.122
So it's loading the CSS, but it's not
really executing any JavaScript yet.

38
00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:52.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: In fact,
you can even see it.

39
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.985
If you open your console here,
let's make this a little bit bigger.

40
00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:00.255
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see
down here at the bottom.

41
00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:06.156
If I say, React, you can see that it
actually is loading React from the CDN.

42
00:03:06.156 --> 00:03:08.150
And the same thing with ReactDOM.

43
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.107
It's also loading ReactDOM from the CDN
based on those two script tags that we

44
00:03:13.107 --> 00:03:13.942
included, right?
