00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:02.245
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk about routing,
so

2
00:00:02.245 --> 00:00:07.140
previous versions of this course I've
taught react router all three times.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.830
To be honest with you still I would
consider react router to be kind of the de

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.560
facto standard.

5
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.430
It's the one that everyones used,
we used it at Netflix,

6
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.430
I've used it at several places now.

7
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.990
It's a great piece of technology and
React Router v4 is really great.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.560
If you're interested in React Router,
v3 of this course teaches React Router v4.

9
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.960
Which is still the current version so
feel free to go take a look at that.

10
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.240
I also taught p1,

11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.106
I think in one of the courses as well,
so I have several of them there.

12
00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:48.450
Today, we're gonna be talking about Reach
Router, Reach Router was written by one

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.660
of the authors of React router, so it's
already written with a lot of experience.

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.020
And, if you have written React Router
before, it still feels pretty familiar.

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.710
In fact, I'm not even gonna really
show you many of the advance

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.240
features of Reach Router.

17
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.680
But it does some really,
really compelling stuff, so

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.750
I invite you to check out
the documentation, it's quite compelling,

19
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.480
so given that,
why am I choosing to teach it?

20
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.820
I do think it's a better library,
personally, the accessibility, the amount

21
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.360
of thought about accessibility that
has gone into Reach Router is amazing.

22
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.280
One thing that reach router does for you,
and you don't have to do anything for,

23
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.790
is it manages the focus of where
things go really really well.

24
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.280
So with React Router,

25
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.070
when a route changed from one thing to
the other, typically what a screen reader

26
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.470
would expect is that you would focus
on the thing that changed, right.

27
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.600
Unfortunately react router,
with the way that it was programmed,

28
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.019
it just really couldn't do it.

29
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.080
So with Reach Router,
Ryan Florence re-architected it so

30
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.040
that he was able to make it
focus on the thing that change.

31
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.346
So that's, to me, the biggest win why,
on top of other things, there's a bunch of

32
00:01:56.346 --> 00:02:00.675
just little niceties, it does relative
paths, which the previous one didn't do.

33
00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:02.766
There's a lot of things
that are really convenient,

34
00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.470
so that's what we're gonna be
talking about today is Reach Router.

35
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.210
But again it's really simular you could
interchange them and almost work.

36
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.507
So what we wanna do now is we're gonna
make this rather than just one page right,

37
00:02:18.507 --> 00:02:20.445
if we go over here this is just one page.

38
00:02:20.445 --> 00:02:23.008
We're gonna separate this into
multiple different pages,

39
00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:24.976
we're gonna make a single
page application.

40
00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:27.920
Now not everything that you do needs
to be a single page application.

41
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.660
You need to be asking yourself,
am I building a single page application?

42
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.370
Don't just assume that everything
should be a single page application.

43
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.670
If you have multiple distinct pages,

44
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.530
those are fine to stay as
separate HTML requests, right?

45
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.240
So you need to ask yourself
am I building an app, or

46
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.240
am I building just like a normal website?

47
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.910
And those can be distinct things,
just make conscientious decisions,

48
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.592
don't just assume.

49
00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:54.849
But I'm going to teach you how to do
a single page application cause that's

50
00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.462
a common thing that people wanna do.

51
00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:02.759
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, let's go and
split this page into a route, so

52
00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.423
right now we have everything
kinda living inside of app,

53
00:03:07.423 --> 00:03:11.913
we're gonna make a new page
here called "results".

54
00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:17.222
So save, inside of source "results.js" and

55
00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:22.400
basically what we're
gonna do is we're gonna

56
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:31.556
take almost everything from
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From app and

57
00:03:31.556 --> 00:03:36.099
move it into results.js, we're not gonna

58
00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.780
take react DOM, so
you can delete that part.

59
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.595
Delete this down here at the bottom and
we're going to export default results.

60
00:03:53.896 --> 00:03:55.856
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean we'll
call this results as well.

61
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:02.432
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let me get make
sure I get all the mark up right.

62
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:14.556
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna get rid of
this top level div here and the Adopt Me

63
00:04:14.556 --> 00:04:20.149
part cuz that'll live inside of the app
and we'll get rid of this div down here.

64
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.997
So now it's just gonna be a div with all
the pets stuff rendering inside of it.

65
00:04:27.997 --> 00:04:32.315
And we're gonna give this
a className of search.

66
00:04:32.315 --> 00:04:36.713
[NOISE] Other than that pretty

67
00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:41.118
sure it's almost the same.

68
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.657
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now let's go to app.js.

69
00:04:50.808 --> 00:04:53.546
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we can just rewrite all this pretty much.

70
00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:02.444
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we'll leave the import
at the top and the render at the bottom.

71
00:05:02.444 --> 00:05:09.885
We'll still have to import
render from react- dom and

72
00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:15.721
now we'll have to import results as well.

73
00:05:15.721 --> 00:05:22.622
Import results from dot/results,

74
00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:28.854
okay then we're gonna have class

75
00:05:28.854 --> 00:05:35.756
app extends reacts dot component and

76
00:05:35.756 --> 00:05:42.657
with a render method return div H1,

77
00:05:42.657 --> 00:05:46.896
adopt me and results.

78
00:06:00.054 --> 00:06:03.564
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So so far the only thing
that we've done is refactored this to be

79
00:06:03.564 --> 00:06:05.860
in a separate component.

80
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.750
This should look exactly
the same otherwise,

81
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.450
other than adding some styling,
cuz we added the search form.

82
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.051
So if we go over here and refresh, yeah,
you should see a white background now but

83
00:06:17.051 --> 00:06:19.065
otherwise it should look
relatively the same.

84
00:06:22.262 --> 00:06:24.072
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we
have the Results route,

85
00:06:24.072 --> 00:06:26.864
which means we can switch
to a different route.

86
00:06:26.864 --> 00:06:34.790
So we're gonna make just a really
quick third page called details.js.

87
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.715
This one's gonna be super simple too,

88
00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:44.939
import React from React and class Details

89
00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:49.574
extends React.Component render.

90
00:06:49.574 --> 00:06:52.902
And for now we're just gonna have it
just return something really dumb.

91
00:06:52.902 --> 00:07:01.516
[SOUND] And then down here at
the bottom export default Details.

92
00:07:04.284 --> 00:07:06.660
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like the simplest
react component you can think of.
