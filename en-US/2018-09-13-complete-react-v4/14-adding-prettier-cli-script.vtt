00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something I want you to do
now, not all of your colleagues are gonna

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.530
bite off right away on installing
Prettier into their editor.

3
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.300
Some people get freaked out when
stuff starts moving around.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.904
So you can be a good person and
come into scripts and

5
00:00:12.904 --> 00:00:15.700
give them the ability to run
it from the command line.

6
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.452
It's kind of, again, a good rule of thumb
is anything you expect people to do,

7
00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:21.528
you should write it
into your scripts here.

8
00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:24.828
So what we're gonna do now
is we're gonna do format,

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.028
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it's gonna be prettier.

10
00:00:33.386 --> 00:00:36.503
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we want prettier to run every js file and

11
00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:38.851
css file, cuz it also does css.

12
00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:46.131
It does json, it does html, less, sass,
it does a lot of different kinds of files.

13
00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:55.093
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we want it to run on,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

14
00:00:55.093 --> 00:00:56.778
you have to surround
these in slash quotes.

15
00:00:56.778 --> 00:00:58.114
These are escaping the quotes, right?

16
00:00:58.114 --> 00:01:02.319
Because it's already inside of
double quotes cuz it's JSON.

17
00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.741
And we want it to run on every source file

18
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:10.724
inside of,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think this is right.

19
00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:28.506
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then we want it
to run on every file that is .js or

20
00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:34.060
jsx or css or html or json,
cuz we have all of those.

21
00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:38.780
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
you also want it to write.

22
00:01:46.154 --> 00:01:50.452
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let me just make sure
that actually works before I explain it.

23
00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:54.201
So if I say, save, npm run format.

24
00:01:57.581 --> 00:02:04.409
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It doesn't work on HTML,
okay, not out of the box.

25
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, cool.

26
00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:12.675
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
talk about this for just a second.

27
00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:17.658
format, so now if I give this
to my colleague that's old

28
00:02:17.658 --> 00:02:22.535
school VI user that refuses
to install any extension,

29
00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:26.470
we all know the type, [LAUGH] right?

30
00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.448
You can say, okay, you don't have
to install it into your editor or

31
00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:30.397
anything like that.

32
00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:33.400
Anytime before you commit,
just run, npm run format.

33
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.527
And it'll format all of
your code the correct way.

34
00:02:36.527 --> 00:02:42.770
So now kf I come over here to my project
and I say, npm run, whatever is here,

35
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.643
so npm run format, it's gonna run
this bash command for them, right?

36
00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:53.025
So, npm run format, it's gonna go
run on App.js and style.css, and

37
00:02:53.025 --> 00:02:56.690
it's gonna format those things
correctly for me, right?

38
00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.610
Now, I will never run this code because
it's already installed in my editor,

39
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.247
right?

40
00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:07.417
I don't need to, but someone else might.

41
00:03:07.417 --> 00:03:14.020
What's also useful about this is now I can
run this in CI, my continuous integration,

42
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.899
and if someone tries to check in code
that has not been formatted by Prettier,

43
00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.888
you can just say, hey,
Prettier, throw an error.

44
00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:28.731
Which I think if you wanted to do that,
the way that would look would be

45
00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:33.832
format:check, and
it would be --check-different, I think.

46
00:03:33.832 --> 00:03:37.507
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's try it,
let me just make sure that, prettier.

47
00:03:52.161 --> 00:03:54.017
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There is
a lot of configuration here.

48
00:03:54.017 --> 00:03:55.763
--list-different, that's what it is.

49
00:03:55.763 --> 00:04:01.263
Okay, so now what you can do,

50
00:04:01.263 --> 00:04:05.883
npm run format:check.

51
00:04:05.883 --> 00:04:09.746
You would run this on TravisCI, or
CircleCI or something like that.

52
00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.179
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
right now, it's gonna pass,

53
00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:15.698
nothing gets outputted,
there's no errors or anything like that.

54
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.084
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that means that this
will pass CI, but if something was not

55
00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:28.050
checked in with prettier run,
let's just try that for just a second.

56
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.501
Can I turn off prettier?

57
00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:39.068
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just to show you what it

58
00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:41.217
looks like when it fails, false, save.

59
00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:48.467
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now if I do,
npm run format:check, it's gonna say,

60
00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:53.368
hey, App.js wasn't formatted with
the prettier, I'm gonna throw an error.

61
00:04:53.368 --> 00:04:55.364
And then this would be caught by your CI.

62
00:04:55.364 --> 00:04:58.215
And your CI would say,
you can't check that in.

63
00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:08.097
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: true.

64
00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:14.433
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, any questions
about prettier before we move on?

65
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:20.698
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is my favorite tool.
I've been coding with it for

66
00:05:20.698 --> 00:05:23.491
like two years now and
I can't code without it.

67
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.497
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's not really
an alternative right now to prettier,

68
00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:37.246
which is okay, it's doing great.

69
00:05:37.246 --> 00:05:40.763
During the course of this entire course,
I will try and

70
00:05:40.763 --> 00:05:45.044
point out if there's alternative
technologies that you can use,

71
00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:48.876
because I'm gonna give you
an opinionated stack, right?

72
00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:52.507
I'm gonna give you the things that I like
to use that I think it's a good idea for

73
00:05:52.507 --> 00:05:53.071
you to use.

74
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:56.336
But I hopefully will also show you
how to plug in different things if

75
00:05:56.336 --> 00:05:58.376
you have different opinions than I do, so

76
00:05:58.376 --> 00:06:01.371
that you can kind of construct
your perfect frontend stack.
