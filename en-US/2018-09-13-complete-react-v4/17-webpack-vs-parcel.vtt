00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.774
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go ahead and
go do Parcel really quick.

2
00:00:04.774 --> 00:00:11.060
So let's go back to our package.json.

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.250
Previous versions of
this course used Webpack.

4
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.240
And Webpack is still, I'll be honest,
what I use most of the time.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.710
When I'm building a big project that I'm
gonna maintain for a really long time,

6
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.910
I typically choose Webpack because
there's a lot of ways you can tweak and

7
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.450
configure it.

8
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.390
That being said, because there are so
many ways to configure Webpack,

9
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.420
it can be a little unruly to manage.

10
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.970
I don't think anyone's
gonna deny that except

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.030
a couple of the core
team members of Webpack.

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.210
In my opinion it can be quite
difficult to configure.

13
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.300
So there's another product
that came along called Parcel.

14
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.130
Parcel is quite similar to Webpack that
it's a bundler for your application, but

15
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.820
it's pretty much zero configuration.

16
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.940
You just say, here's my index.html file.

17
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.450
Please do everything else and
it just handles it for you.

18
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.806
It's really, really nice in that respect.

19
00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:09.000
So that is why I actually,
I really like it for teaching.

20
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.880
Because you and I don't have to spend a
bunch of time setting up a build process,

21
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.640
it just kind of happens.

22
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130
And to be honest with you
there are some really,

23
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.610
really smart people working on Parcel,
it's just getting better everyday.

24
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.351
So if you ask me which one I prefer,
Webpack or Parcel,

25
00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:23.265
I really like both of them quite a bit.

26
00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:26.718
But like I wanna point out right now
that you can definitely use Webpack,

27
00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:28.766
Webpack's not dead, nothing like that.

28
00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:30.772
They're both really great projects and

29
00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:33.847
they're both pushing each other
to be even better projects.

30
00:01:33.847 --> 00:01:35.447
So I like both teams.

31
00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:37.137
I think they're both good projects.

32
00:01:37.137 --> 00:01:38.540
You should definitely look into both.

33
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.268
And if you're interested in
building React with Webpack,

34
00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:46.825
check out V3 of this course because
it goes over Webpack quite in depth.

35
00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:50.818
And then there's, not only that Sean
Larkin and one of the core maintainers of

36
00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:54.451
Webpack, actually comes in to
Frontend Masters and does a really great

37
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:58.760
Webpack course that shows you all the
crazy stuff that you can do with Webpack.

38
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.665
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When would you
choose one versus the other?

39
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:09.021
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Me, personally.

40
00:02:09.021 --> 00:02:12.559
If I wanna do something really quick and
just like get up running right

41
00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:16.524
away there's nothing better than Parcel
cuz it really is just like Parcel and

42
00:02:16.524 --> 00:02:18.021
then you're done, right?

43
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.050
If I'm gonna build something that's large,
and

44
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.350
I'm gonna have crazy requirements and
I need to configure a bunch of stuff, and

45
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.410
maybe write my own plug ins and
stuff like that, I'm gonna choose Webpack.

46
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.650
Now, I really hesitate to
say that because I'm not

47
00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.140
trying to imply that
you can't scale Parcel.

48
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.690
I think it does scale quite well as well.

49
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.090
So, really it's your preference on
how much configuration you want,

50
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.120
I think that's the key there.

51
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.420
Webpack it's a lot more mature,
it's been around for longer.

52
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.600
But like I said there is really smart
people working on both of them,

53
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.510
so it's preference.

54
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.626
I'm probably overly oriented towards
Webpack because I've been using it

55
00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:00.720
for so long.

56
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.870
I have a little bit of survivorship
bias that I have survived Webpack for

57
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.180
long enough that I know how to use it.

58
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.570
If you're getting started with Webpack,
it can be difficult.

59
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.050
Now they're doing stuff to remedy that,

60
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.230
so I also don't wanna say that
Webpack's super difficult.

61
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.694
They've made it a lot easier
since with V4 going forward, so.

62
00:03:20.622 --> 00:03:23.151
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I hope I gave
you a total non-answer,

63
00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:25.685
because that's what I was going for.

64
00:03:25.685 --> 00:03:29.258
[LAUGH] Cool, any other questions?

65
00:03:29.258 --> 00:03:30.231
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's good.

66
00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:32.460
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's tough,

67
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.246
because I like both teams a lot and I
don't wanna disparage either one of them.

68
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.311
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I know after this I'm
gonna get Sean Larkin tweets saying like,

69
00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:42.380
what the hell are you doing?

70
00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.640
So, sorry Sean.
