1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.607
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One more thing that we
need to do before we wrap up context,

2
00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:08.511
we wanna make it so if you're on,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: SearchParams.

3
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.297
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right now this Submit

4
00:00:13.297 --> 00:00:15.830
button doesn't work cuz we're not
passing anything in here, right?

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.647
So the way we're gonna make
that work is if you go over to

6
00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:26.881
SearchParams.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All we need to do is we

7
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.357
need to make this navigate to the results
page whenever we click Search, right?

8
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.430
Luckily, this is actually
pretty easy to do.

9
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:41.295
So I'm gonna do handleSearchSubmit here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

10
00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.909
this doesn't even have
to be an arrow function.

11
00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.579
And I'm just gonna say navigate, and

12
00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.754
I'm gonna pull this in from reach/router,
which you can see here on line

13
00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:58.081
3 that I imported it.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: navigate('/').

14
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.368
navigate is something that
reach/router exports for you so

15
00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:08.032
you can programmatically redirect people.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Because

16
00:01:08.032 --> 00:01:15.640
everything's being stored via context in
app, it's going to live across navigation.

17
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.133
So we don't have to submit
any data like that.

18
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:20.583
It's already living up in the app parent,
right?

19
00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:26.208
So it survives this navigation.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

20
00:01:26.208 --> 00:01:31.159
now that we do this,
we have to pass it into SearchBox, so

21
00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.274
search=this.handleSearchSubmit.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,

22
00:01:37.274 --> 00:01:41.293
if we go to the SearchParams,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

23
00:01:41.293 --> 00:01:45.188
do cat,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Balinese and Submit,

24
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:49.420
it takes us to the results page
with all that filled out, right?

25
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.172
Because it's that, the true context,
that data's being stored in the app and

26
00:01:53.172 --> 00:01:56.028
then passed back into the results page,
which is using it for

27
00:01:56.028 --> 00:02:00.681
the search.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go do one more thing.

28
00:02:04.443 --> 00:02:05.722
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: On the app.js page,

29
00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:10.483
let's just make it so you can navigate to
that page so you don't actually have to

30
00:02:10.483 --> 00:02:16.211
URL hack to get to there.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

31
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:21.113
here where it says header,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're

32
00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:25.351
gonna put another link.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: link

33
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:30.616
to="/search-params".

34
00:02:32.542 --> 00:02:36.304
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then here we're gonna put

35
00:02:36.304 --> 00:02:42.632
a span with an aria-label equal to search.

36
00:02:42.632 --> 00:02:47.466
role= "img".

37
00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:52.421
And,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then I'm going to put a,

38
00:02:52.421 --> 00:02:54.033
you can put an emoji there.

39
00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:58.012
So what do I call that spot, or

40
00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:03.884
eyeglass?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I forgot what it's called.

41
00:03:09.212 --> 00:03:10.923
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Frequently Used, yeah,

42
00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:13.890
this one, left pointing magnifying glass.

43
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.297
How could I not remember that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

44
00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:21.049
I'm just gonna put an emoji
there till I correct it.

45
00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.420
Show that you can navigate to that.

46
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.684
So how do we put emojis in on Windows,
I don't know how to do that.

47
00:03:29.684 --> 00:03:35.651
But in Mac, it's Ctrl/Cmd space
will bring up this thing and

48
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:42.384
you can just find left pointing.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It was here,

49
00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:46.241
this one, left pointing magnifying glass.

50
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:50.175
Or put a happy face there, up to you.

51
00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:53.415
Talking about the span here for a second.

52
00:03:53.415 --> 00:03:56.355
So we have to let screen readers
know that like this is an image,

53
00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:58.249
which is what the real image is, right?

54
00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.560
Because this we're using
this emoji as an image.

55
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.550
And then we have to give it a label
to let the screen reader know.

56
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.130
If someone taps over this, what is it?

57
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.080
And this will take you to the search page.

58
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.603
So if they hit Enter on it,
it will take them to the search

59
00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:17.555
page.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

60
00:04:17.555 --> 00:04:21.850
in fact, if I take this away,
it's gonna yell at me.

61
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.441
Hey, emojis need to be wrapped in spans,

62
00:04:23.441 --> 00:04:28.797
by the way.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

63
00:04:28.797 --> 00:04:31.650
just good practice,
good accessibility practices.

64
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.245
So now if you come in here,

65
00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:35.850
you'll see this little thing
up here in the top right.

66
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.096
And you can click, it will take
you to the SearchParam's page.

67
00:04:43.353 --> 00:04:44.326
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is kind of fun.

68
00:04:47.712 --> 00:04:51.008
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

69
00:04:52.723 --> 00:04:54.204
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So there's a commit

70
00:04:54.204 --> 00:04:58.740
there at the bottom of the context
page if you need to catch up.
