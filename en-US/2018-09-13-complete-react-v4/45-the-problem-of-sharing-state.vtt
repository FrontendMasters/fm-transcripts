00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.144
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what happens,

2
00:00:01.144 --> 00:00:04.375
in fact this is actually a problem that
we have right now in our application.

3
00:00:04.375 --> 00:00:08.916
We have this adopt me page
like the results page, right.

4
00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:12.442
And then we have a SearchParams page but
they're not talking to each other yet.

5
00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:15.181
We have state that lives in one route and

6
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:18.340
we need to pass it to the other route,
right.

7
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.620
So how do we do that?

8
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.720
Well, there's actually quite a elegant and

9
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.461
simple way of doing that which
typically I would advise you how to do.

10
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.611
The way that I would do that,
if I come into my code here,

11
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:34.308
is I would move everything
from SearchParams.

12
00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:40.499
So breed, animal, and location I would
move this up into App.js, right.

13
00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:46.105
Because this is the common parent
between results and SearchParams.

14
00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:52.285
And then I would pass both those things in
as props to result in searchParams, right.

15
00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:56.631
And then both of them would have
access to the same shared data.

16
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.184
In general this is what I
would advise you to do.

17
00:00:58.184 --> 00:01:02.789
This is what React was designed around as
being able to share your state as props to

18
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.949
children, right.

19
00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.453
And then I would move
the handle breed selector into

20
00:01:09.453 --> 00:01:14.702
app as well, and
pass those event selectors in.

21
00:01:14.702 --> 00:01:18.461
So that the children can call
functions on the parents, right.

22
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:22.181
In fact,
I have this code written out for you and

23
00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:27.482
I wanna show it to you, here without
context this branch down here.

24
00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:33.225
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, I have it open as
a pull request so we can see the div.

25
00:01:42.962 --> 00:01:47.103
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you look into app.js,
we start tracking all the stuff in state.

26
00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:51.673
So you can see we have city-state up here,
which there's a conflict between what

27
00:01:51.673 --> 00:01:55.727
router wanted to call it's location and
what I wanted to call location.

28
00:01:55.727 --> 00:02:01.675
So I called it city-state instead here and
then I have all these methods.

29
00:02:01.675 --> 00:02:03.842
Can I just say view, here we go.

30
00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:11.187
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I moved the state up here into app, and

31
00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:15.119
then I probably make this
a little bit bigger too.

32
00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:22.289
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then I moved all these event handlers into

33
00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.338
app.js
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

34
00:02:24.338 --> 00:02:25.812
well as get breeze as well.

35
00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:32.302
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then notice that
I start passing all these things

36
00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:36.338
into SearchParams and
into Results as well.

37
00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:39.368
So this is how I would typically
advise you how to do it, right.

38
00:02:39.368 --> 00:02:42.094
Move everything into App.js,
the common parent, and

39
00:02:42.094 --> 00:02:44.704
then pass all those event
handlers into both of them,

40
00:02:44.704 --> 00:02:47.443
if they need to handle events,
as well as all the state.

41
00:02:47.443 --> 00:02:52.983
And now, Results and SearchParams can
individually use these things as prompts.

42
00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:55.877
So just what that looks like inside of.

43
00:02:55.877 --> 00:03:00.845
So instead here in results, because this
is getting passed in from the parent I'd

44
00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:03.951
refer to location as the stop
prompts at location.

45
00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:05.393
Animal at the stop prompt of animal.

46
00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:10.601
And then I would use all that
data inside of results.js.

47
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.576
In general this is how you wanna
handle this kind of thing, right.

48
00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:15.018
Does that make sense?

49
00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:18.888
This is the entire magic of React,
it's just passing props around and

50
00:03:18.888 --> 00:03:21.193
managing state, and that's really it.

51
00:03:21.193 --> 00:03:23.548
And honestly we can end the class here,
and

52
00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:27.221
you would have a pretty good
understanding now of how React works.

53
00:03:27.221 --> 00:03:30.063
The only thing that's left
is advanced features, and

54
00:03:30.063 --> 00:03:32.780
that's what the rest this
course is gonna be about,

55
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.255
everything else is just managing state and
props and components.

56
00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:40.015
States, props, and components and
that's really the end of it.

57
00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:44.999
This is why I like React, this is why I
teach React, this is why I write React at

58
00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:48.701
every job that I go to is
because it's knowable, right.

59
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:52.405
A day and a half and
you're done with knowing what React does.

60
00:03:52.405 --> 00:03:54.597
Now that's not the complete picture,

61
00:03:54.597 --> 00:03:57.587
we still have to talk about
the ecosystem around it but

62
00:03:57.587 --> 00:04:01.720
in general what I've shown you here
is just passing at state and prompts.

63
00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:07.029
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But
it wouldn't be fun to end here,

64
00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.352
we got tons more stuff to talk about.

65
00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:12.147
So we'll start getting more
into the advance stuff here,

66
00:04:12.147 --> 00:04:15.023
more of like the intermediate react stuff.
