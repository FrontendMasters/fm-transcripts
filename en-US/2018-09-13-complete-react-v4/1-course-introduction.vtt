00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.060
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My name's Brian,

2
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.060
I work at Microsoft as
a Senior Cloud Developer Advocate

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.710
which means that I'm a conduit
between you and Microsoft's Cloud.

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.560
I listen to your feedback,
I take it to the product team.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.880
And then I listen to the product
team's new features and I try and

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.620
tell people about it.

7
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.510
This course has nothing to do with Azure,
that's just what my day job is.

8
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.932
But I really quite like it.

9
00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:22.668
I think this is my,

10
00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:25.310
I was trying to count how many times
I've been to Frontend Masters.

11
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.250
I think this is my eighth time teaching
here, something like that-ish.

12
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.740
So I love Frontend Masters, I love what
they do, I love what they stand for.

13
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.070
That's why I keep coming back.

14
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.408
Sometimes on this podcast called
Frontend Happy Hour which is kind of fun.

15
00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:46.237
And I've also worked at LinkedIn,
Netflix, Reddit,

16
00:00:46.237 --> 00:00:49.329
Needle, ksl.com, and NewSkin.

17
00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.683
And I was recently just
made a board member of

18
00:00:52.683 --> 00:00:56.229
a really cool 501(c) called Vet to Code.

19
00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:59.869
Which helps veterans coming out of the
military learn how to code which I think

20
00:00:59.869 --> 00:01:01.550
is a pretty awesome organization.

21
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.240
From Seattle,
I have a little dog named Luna.

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.740
She's adorable, and
yeah, it's pretty great.

23
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.010
I have all my social links up here, so
feel free to message me on Twitter, or

24
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.920
connect with me on LinkedIn,
or whatever suits you.

25
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.590
And I just want to give another shoutout
to Frontend Masters at this point,

26
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.160
really really stoked to be
working with them again.

27
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.490
These materials are open source, so
feel free if you see spelling mistakes or

28
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.020
anything like that to open
a pull request and fix them.

29
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.799
Please take these materials and
share them with anyone that needs them.

30
00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.095
I love that Frontend Masters lets
me open source my materials so

31
00:01:42.095 --> 00:01:45.950
that people that can't necessarily
afford to watch the video could still

32
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.766
have everything I prepared here.

33
00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.920
So thanks, Frontend Maters.

34
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.917
And just a slight humble plea,
if you could star the repo on GetHub,

35
00:01:55.917 --> 00:02:01.020
it helps expand the reach of the repo,
so that would be really great.

36
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.346
There's a link down at the bottom
if you want to do that.

37
00:02:03.346 --> 00:02:04.614
Up to you though.

38
00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:05.667
I'll just be a little upset.

39
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.312
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, so

40
00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:10.371
that's a little bit about me.

41
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:16.685
I've been writing React since,
I first launched React at Reddit,

42
00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:21.770
I was the first person
to launch it at Reddit.

43
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.981
We were pretty early adopters on it.

44
00:02:23.981 --> 00:02:26.721
But we were still in a stage
where people like React is gross,

45
00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:28.720
because you have HTMLs in your JavaScript.

46
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.720
Which admittedly at first
felt really gross to me.

47
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.153
I remember I was watching
Pete Hunt announce it, and

48
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:39.490
I was like this seems really bad, and
I just kinda dismissed it out of hand.

49
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.572
I had a colleague come back
to me six months later,

50
00:02:41.572 --> 00:02:45.057
this is while I was working at Reddit, and
said, you should really check this out.

51
00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:50.590
I spent a weekend hacking with it and was
like, this is great, I'm going to rewrite

52
00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.064
the entire Reddit marketplace check out
in React, which I did in about a weekend.

53
00:02:56.064 --> 00:03:00.679
Finished the rewrite, launched it without
really telling anyone else I was going to

54
00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.638
that, and then I went on vacation.

55
00:03:02.638 --> 00:03:08.232
[LAUGH] Not just any vacation, I was
on a cruise ship so I was unreachable.

56
00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:12.347
So the compelling story that I like tell
people is that I launched this entire

57
00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:14.418
rewrite in React, went on vacation.

58
00:03:14.418 --> 00:03:18.870
I was the only front end developer
working on marketplace at the time.

59
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.174
And obviously it broke because you can't
rewrite an entire large piece of software

60
00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:24.350
without it breaking.

61
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.330
But one of the backend
developers that wrote Python for

62
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.453
his day job was not necessarily
a JavaScript developer.

63
00:03:30.453 --> 00:03:33.778
Was able to actually go in,
understand my code by reading it and

64
00:03:33.778 --> 00:03:38.009
fix it without knowing React, without
really knowing JavaScript super well.

65
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.006
And that, to me,

66
00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:42.801
was the moment I understand the real
value of proposition of React.

67
00:03:42.801 --> 00:03:49.055
To me, having been writing React now at
several companies, it's very maintainable.

68
00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:50.498
It's very easy to understand.

69
00:03:50.498 --> 00:03:52.255
It's very easy to kind
of like read through and

70
00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:54.910
understand everything
that things are doing.

71
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.910
Like I'll be honest,
if you're coming from Angular,

72
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.250
this is gonna feel pretty verbose, right?

73
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.790
We write more code that
you write in Angular,

74
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.470
and I'm speaking from
the perspective Angular JS.

75
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.810
I haven't written too much of the newer
Angular, but with Angular JS1,

76
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.159
which I was in love with before
I started writing React.

77
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.520
This feels a lot more verbose.

78
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.170
You have to write more code.

79
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.240
But the magic here is that because you're
writing more code you're being more

80
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.890
explicit, like this connects to this.

81
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.460
There's no magic connection of the two,
which means that later when I come back

82
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.800
and I've forgotten everything that I've
written I can still see that connection.

83
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.799
I don't really have to know too much how
React is connecting the two because I can

84
00:04:35.799 --> 00:04:37.303
see how they're connected.

85
00:04:37.303 --> 00:04:39.075
So that's why I like React.

86
00:04:39.075 --> 00:04:40.626
That's why I continue to go back to it.

87
00:04:40.626 --> 00:04:44.475
That's why I still write new
projects in React is because

88
00:04:44.475 --> 00:04:49.285
it's very easy to maintain, that I
can launch it and come back later and

89
00:04:49.285 --> 00:04:52.270
not yell at myself for
using too much magic.

90
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.605
So let's get into this.

91
00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:57.333
So yeah, these are the notes.

92
00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:00.217
If you fall behind as well,
feel free to read my notes.

93
00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:03.504
I literally have my notes
up here on this computer.

94
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:06.955
So that's why I've kind of
open-sourced my speaker's notes, so

95
00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:09.140
that you can kinda see what's happening.
