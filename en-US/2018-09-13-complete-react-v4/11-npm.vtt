00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.371
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So at this point we're
going to talk about some of the tooling

2
00:00:05.371 --> 00:00:06.554
around react.

3
00:00:06.554 --> 00:00:10.078
[COUGH] Which if you are working in
a project, you'll have a back end and

4
00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:12.888
a build process authority
that's been built for you and

5
00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:15.400
you don't have to worry about tooling.

6
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.219
You can go ahead and kinda lightly skim
over the NPM easily in prettier and

7
00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:22.985
parcel parts of this particular course,

8
00:00:22.985 --> 00:00:27.819
that's gonna teach you the tools of
how to build your own React project.

9
00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.922
Throughout the rest of the day,
we'll still be talking about various

10
00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:33.499
things that you'll need to
add to these configurations,

11
00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:36.196
which you might have to do in
order to keep up with the course.

12
00:00:36.196 --> 00:00:40.446
But these are not necessarily
things that you need to know,

13
00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:45.128
if you're not building your own
new project with your own tools.

14
00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:48.590
So you can just go ahead and
probably skip to the JSX section.

15
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.656
I want to take a break from React just for

16
00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:56.047
a second to kind of focus
on our tools a little bit.

17
00:00:56.047 --> 00:01:00.446
Right now, we're building everything and
by compiling or kind of ourselves by

18
00:01:00.446 --> 00:01:04.924
the browser and bringing all the script
tags together and all that kind of stuff.

19
00:01:04.924 --> 00:01:08.069
And that doesn't really work super well,
especially over time, right?

20
00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:11.989
If I had to include all of the right
components in the right order inside of my

21
00:01:11.989 --> 00:01:15.619
index.html, that's gonna get
real tedious really fast, right?

22
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.164
So what I wanna do is I wanna bring in
some tools that are gonna help keep our

23
00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:23.980
code quality high,
help us be more productive, and

24
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.742
let us organize our code
a little bit better right?

25
00:01:26.742 --> 00:01:29.953
Right now, we have two components
in one file, let me say,

26
00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:32.380
that will almost never happen.

27
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.194
Every component should
typically have its own file.

28
00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:39.753
Even if the file is only five lines long,
that's okay,

29
00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:42.668
you should probably still do that.

30
00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:49.290
You should always do that,
I never put two components in one file.

31
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.387
So let's go and start with that.

32
00:01:56.517 --> 00:01:58.692
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The first thing
is that we're gonna install or

33
00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:02.606
that you've probably hopefully have
already installed is something called npm.

34
00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:07.187
It comes along with Node, so if you
have not installed NodeJS at this point,

35
00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:09.845
please go to NodeJS.org and install Node.

36
00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:12.718
It should work on any platform
that you're following along with.

37
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.278
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Along
when you install Node,

38
00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:18.903
you'll also get the latest version on npm.

39
00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:21.548
I think, I'm using 10,

40
00:02:21.548 --> 00:02:27.421
let me just make sure what
version of Node, I'm using nine.

41
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:29.132
I probably should be using ten but
in all honesty,

42
00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:30.575
we're not gonna be using Node that much.

43
00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:34.060
That it's gonna matter as long
as you're above probably six.

44
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.741
If you're above six you should be fine,
but

45
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:37.295
I would recommend you be on eight or ten.

46
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.797
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so npm does
not stand for node package manager.

47
00:02:43.797 --> 00:02:47.013
They won't tell you what it stands for but
it's also the node package manager, so

48
00:02:47.013 --> 00:02:48.937
I just kinda say it's
the node package manager.

49
00:02:48.937 --> 00:02:53.266
[LAUGH] But, It also includes
everything for the frontend, as well.

50
00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:55.666
So React, for example, is also an npm.

51
00:02:55.666 --> 00:03:00.515
So it's also kind of, the build system and

52
00:03:00.515 --> 00:03:05.777
package registry for
the frontend, as well.

53
00:03:05.777 --> 00:03:10.872
So what we're gonna do is, we're
gonna come to our command line again.

54
00:03:10.872 --> 00:03:14.995
And we're gonna go to our root
directory of wherever your project is.

55
00:03:14.995 --> 00:03:16.220
Mine's here in fem.

56
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.128
So I'm gonna say here npm init, like that.

57
00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:31.405
And I don't really wanna ask you a bunch
of questions if you Don't say -y,

58
00:03:31.405 --> 00:03:36.604
-y means, just say yes to all
the questions, I don't care.

59
00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:39.076
So now, it generates this package.json.

60
00:03:39.076 --> 00:03:42.065
So if you look here,
I have a package.json file as well.

61
00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:45.960
This is kind of the manifest for
your project.

62
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.863
So inside the manifest here,
I can define all my dependencies,

63
00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:52.257
I can define tasks that need to happen.

64
00:03:52.257 --> 00:03:56.702
It's a really useful thing for
having for front end projects, okay.

65
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Some of this is not right,
it doesn't have an author.

66
00:04:03.216 --> 00:04:06.171
It says, if I run npm run test,
it's gonna say, hey,

67
00:04:06.171 --> 00:04:09.640
you haven't defined what tests are, right.

68
00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.034
Error, no test specified.

69
00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:15.186
But in any case, we'll fix all
that kind of as we go along here.

70
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:20.808
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
now, if we go over here,

71
00:04:20.808 --> 00:04:27.599
I'll get rid of that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

72
00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:31.438
now, if we can open our package.json, you
can see here there's just not a ton in it.

73
00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:38.533
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and now as we start
installing dependencies in our projects.

74
00:04:38.533 --> 00:04:41.361
It's gonna start saving these
dependencies so that later,

75
00:04:41.361 --> 00:04:45.077
if you wanna give this project to your
friend, your friend can also bring in this

76
00:04:45.077 --> 00:04:48.368
project, install its dependencies and
build your project, right?

77
00:04:48.368 --> 00:04:50.820
So it's making your
code more shareable and

78
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.214
reproducible which is really important.

79
00:04:53.214 --> 00:04:56.511
Any questions about npm?

80
00:04:56.511 --> 00:05:01.320
Question that I often get here is,
what about Yarn?

81
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.617
Which previous versions of
this course do use yarn.

82
00:05:04.617 --> 00:05:06.220
I'm fine with both of them.

83
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.720
Both install things from the npn registry.

84
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.513
They're just two different clients for

85
00:05:10.513 --> 00:05:13.476
installing the things from
the registry and they're both great.

86
00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:15.920
So whatever one you choose
to use is fine with me.

87
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.082
I'm gonna be using npn for
the rest of this course but

88
00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:19.270
you are welcome to use yarn.

89
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.458
Just yeah, you gonna have to translate
all the things in your head.

90
00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.250
But they both work great.
