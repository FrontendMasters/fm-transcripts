00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.760
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So let's go ahead and
start building our project here.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.659
We're gonna go into our command line,

3
00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:15.111
and we're gonna say mpm install -D

4
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:21.359
parcel-bundler,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that.

5
00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.216
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Something that I wanted to,

6
00:00:34.216 --> 00:00:35.582
this obviously all will work for

7
00:00:35.582 --> 00:00:38.173
you because you're all doing
this on the same date that I am.

8
00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.129
But for
people watching this video in the future,

9
00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.264
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You might have

10
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:45.121
version incompatibilities.

11
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:49.174
Because if you watch this six months
from now, versions will change,

12
00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:52.010
APIs will break, all that kind of stuff.

13
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.660
If you're finding yourself having weird
errors with ESLint, or Prettier, or

14
00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.490
Parcel, what I would suggest
you do is go to the GitHub for

15
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.800
this particular project, which is here.

16
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.530
And look at the package.json for
the versions that I'm using,

17
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.453
and just go and
install those versions of what I'm using.

18
00:01:13.453 --> 00:01:17.116
Because things might break, or
you can at least find an upgrade guide or

19
00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:18.286
something like that.

20
00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:20.860
But that's something you
should be suspect of.

21
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.904
So for example, of Parcel,
we are using 1.9.7.

22
00:01:30.506 --> 00:01:34.061
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Oops, t hat's the project.

23
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.614
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,

24
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.818
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we have parcel-bundler

25
00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:47.720
installed now, and
this is the wow moment for Parcel.

26
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.080
I'm just gonna say comma,
and I'm gonna put dev.

27
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.332
This is inside of scripts, right,

28
00:01:57.332 --> 00:02:02.830
parcel src/index.html, that's it.

29
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.927
That's really all we have to do for
Parcel for the rest of the course.

30
00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.323
There's no additional
configuration that we need here,

31
00:02:11.323 --> 00:02:16.565
just blows my mind.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But that's because

32
00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:21.080
Parcel knows out of the box what to do
with most of the types of frontend files.

33
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.000
So it knows how to handle Flow,
it knows how to handle TypeScript,

34
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.616
it knows how to handle JSX.

35
00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:29.752
These are all things that it just
knows how to handle out of the box,

36
00:02:29.752 --> 00:02:30.766
which is amazing..

37
00:02:30.766 --> 00:02:37.637
It can handle SASS, it can handle LESS,
handles quite a bit of stuff.

38
00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:46.820
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Great, so

39
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.067
now what we should be
able to do is say mpm

40
00:02:52.067 --> 00:03:00.365
run dev.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now,

41
00:03:00.365 --> 00:03:04.780
this isn't super interesting because
we're not really compiling anything.

42
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.257
Right, we're not doing module imports,
we're not bringing in anything from our

43
00:03:08.257 --> 00:03:10.554
node module,
sSo nothing's really happening here.

44
00:03:10.554 --> 00:03:13.655
All it's just doing is running
a local server for us.

45
00:03:13.655 --> 00:03:19.410
So whereas before, you have been running
your project using the file open.

46
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.912
Right, we're not gonna do that anymore.

47
00:03:21.912 --> 00:03:26.347
Instead of doing file open, what we're
gonna do is, we're gonna go to localhost,

48
00:03:26.347 --> 00:03:29.408
which is, localhost points
at your computer, right, so

49
00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:31.040
it kinda loops back to itself.

50
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.230
So it pretends that it's going out to the
Internet to get this file, but it's really

51
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.470
just grabbing it from your own local
computer, that's what localhost does.

52
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.339
And then localhost:1234 is
the port that it's on, by default,

53
00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.978
that's where it opens, so localhost:1234.

54
00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:51.554
The port, in case you're wondering,
it's like an address.

55
00:03:51.554 --> 00:03:55.749
Right, localhost tells you where to go,
so it goes to your computer.

56
00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.378
And then it says, which address,
which door to knock on to get it.

57
00:03:58.378 --> 00:04:02.749
Right, so we're going to address 1234,
and we open it,

58
00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.364
we can see our project here, right?
