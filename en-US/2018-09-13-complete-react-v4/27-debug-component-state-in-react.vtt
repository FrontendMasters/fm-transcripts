00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.420
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now we have this array that
we can be confident going forward this

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.550
represents the state of
the world in terms of

3
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.840
the pets that we have inside of our API,
right.

4
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.760
Now what's cool about this is now we can
always depend that there's going to be

5
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.830
an array of pets.

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.640
That array of pets might be empty, right,
but we know that it's always going to be,

7
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.100
at any given time,
that represents what pets we have.

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.920
This is another powerful
paradigm of React,

9
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.750
that rather than trying to think about
things as they evolve over time,

10
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.550
I get to think about things
in terms of snapshots, right.

11
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.020
Given this state,
this React component will look like this.

12
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.350
Given an empty array,
it's going to look like this.

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.433
Given an array full of pets,
it looks like this.

14
00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:43.310
And so it's just always a snapshot
given some sort of pets, right.

15
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.713
Your components become a function
of state, which is powerful.

16
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't have to care
really how it evolves over time.

17
00:00:57.025 --> 00:01:01.290
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just to show you kind of

18
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.118
what this looks like first, I'm just gonna
show you kinda like a little cool hack

19
00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.470
that Ryan Florence taught me how to do.

20
00:01:11.731 --> 00:01:14.017
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I have pre which is preformatted, and

21
00:01:14.017 --> 00:01:16.710
code which is format this like code.

22
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.212
And then here I can say,
JSON.stringify(this.state, null, 4.

23
00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:26.364
This is just going to dump all all
of your state out into your dump,

24
00:01:26.364 --> 00:01:29.746
so you can actually see
what it looks like.

25
00:01:29.746 --> 00:01:37.158
So if I go over here and refresh, this
is probably super hard for you to see.

26
00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:39.918
But you can see here all of
the stuff that's coming back

27
00:01:39.918 --> 00:01:41.847
from the API is just being dumped out.

28
00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:49.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,
you can see German Shepherd Dog,

29
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.780
right, so that's pretty cool too.

30
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.550
That's a really just quick and cheap way
of visualizing all your state over time.

31
00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is the four parameter,
how many-

32
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.010
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Indents, yep.
