1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.661
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Welcome, buckle up,
I guess is my best advice to you.

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:05.470
This is version four of this course.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.722
I can't believe this is the fourth time
I've come back here to teach this course.

4
00:00:09.722 --> 00:00:14.813
Like Mark was alluding to, this course
is quite different from the other three.

5
00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:18.899
The other three were kind of
reintroductions of the same material,

6
00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:20.553
modified and modernized.

7
00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:26.942
And actually, v3 is still pretty good,
in the sense that it's not very outdated.

8
00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:30.061
That's actually one thing I appreciate
about Frontend Masters is that they always

9
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.860
come back here to make sure
everything's super, super fresh.

10
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.270
With that being said,
if you want to learn about Webpack and

11
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.759
some of those other tools that I'm using
in v3, definitely, it's still valid.

12
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.340
But for this one, we kind of
restructured the course a little bit so

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.290
the first half of this
course is just React, or

14
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.740
at least it's the barely amount of
tools that you need to know React.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.042
So we do Parcel and
some of these other things so

16
00:00:56.042 --> 00:01:01.138
that you can build a real project,
but they're pretty minimal tools.

17
00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:07.069
Then the second half of this course,
as you can see after step 12 there,

18
00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:12.270
is individual modules, and so
they're all self-contained.

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.270
So if you wanna skip Emotion and

20
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.780
go down to Redux,
they're all self-contained, which

21
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.440
is gonna be really great in case you don't
wanna learn all of those different things.

22
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.011
There's a link here to v3.

23
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:30.491
The other thing is if you want to get
to that website, it's bit.ly/react-v4.

24
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:32.925
And that should just
take you directly there.

25
00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:36.900
Cool, so there's a link to v3 here.

26
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.274
In fact, I'll just show you right here.

27
00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:44.490
If you go here, you can see all
the various things that v1 and

28
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.135
v2 and v3 cover.

29
00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:51.903
So if I'm not covering something
here today that you wanna cover,

30
00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.760
definitely try v3.

31
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.456
I'm not going over
styled components today.

32
00:01:55.456 --> 00:02:00.394
That only happens in v3, for example.

33
00:02:00.394 --> 00:02:02.721
Okay, the next thing I wanted to,

34
00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:06.109
just kind some more
housekeeping kind of things.

35
00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.798
You'll see these kinda trees
throughout the entire thing here.

36
00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:15.079
This course I developed has
a series of commits on a repo.

37
00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.886
So if you get lost, you can actually
go back to that commit in the repo and

38
00:02:18.886 --> 00:02:20.550
it'll take you to that point.

39
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.939
And I'm gonna show you how to do that
really quick because not everyone

40
00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.018
necessarily knows how to do that with Git.

41
00:02:26.018 --> 00:02:30.370
So if you know how do you do with Git
already, great, you can just tune out for

42
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.077
like the next three minutes.

43
00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:35.477
If you don't know how
to use this with Git,

44
00:02:35.477 --> 00:02:39.925
I'm going to invite you to
go use sourcetreeapp.com.

45
00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:40.989
This is from Atlassian.

46
00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.115
They make BitBucket, Jira,
all your favorite or not favorite tools,

47
00:02:45.115 --> 00:02:47.124
depending on who you're asking.

48
00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:48.191
Go ahead and download this.

49
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.957
This works well on both Windows and
on Mac OSx.

50
00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:54.025
I have it open here.

51
00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:56.852
What you're gonna wanna do then is go

52
00:02:56.852 --> 00:03:01.535
to
github.com/btholt/complete-intro-to-react-

53
00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:06.475
-v4.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Should take you to

54
00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:07.266
this repo.

55
00:03:07.266 --> 00:03:11.191
You're gonna want to clone this repo.

56
00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:15.432
So I'm gonna copy that and
open it in source tree

57
00:03:15.432 --> 00:03:20.167
here.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sorry,

58
00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:22.920
this is still kind of a new one for me.

59
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.780
I don't really ever use GUIs, but
I know it is helpful for some people.

60
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.257
So in any case, you'll clone the repo,

61
00:03:32.257 --> 00:03:37.920
repository.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think that's what I want.

62
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.475
Clone from URL, Source URL, put that in
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

63
00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:52.707
it'll clone in that repo for you.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So

64
00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:56.921
let's just clone that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Take a second,

65
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.149
it'll clone it, and
you can see here that it'll open it.

66
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.410
So you can see here I have 1, 2,
I recognize that I have two 3s, and

67
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.620
I did not have time to fix that.

68
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:13.522
So I am sorry, there's the first 3 and
a second 3, cuz I count good.

69
00:04:13.522 --> 00:04:16.628
But you can see here,
number 1 is the first commit in here, and

70
00:04:16.628 --> 00:04:19.920
let's actually go give you an example
of what I'm talking about.

71
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.490
So this is an example of one
of these commits, right?

72
00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.439
So you can see here,
just look at the first bit of it here.

73
00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:31.757
And then, if I go to Sourcetree,

74
00:04:31.757 --> 00:04:36.704
you can see here d6bf51f, right?

75
00:04:36.704 --> 00:04:38.920
So that matches the first part of it here.

76
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.829
So you know that this is the commit
that it matches up against, right?

77
00:04:42.829 --> 00:04:44.007
Does that make sense?

78
00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:46.843
So all you have to do if I wanna
go back to this point in the repo,

79
00:04:46.843 --> 00:04:48.713
I just right-click and I say Checkout.

80
00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:51.072
It's gonna say,
are you sure you wanna checkout?

81
00:04:51.072 --> 00:04:55.940
And you'll actually go back here and it'll
move your repo back to that point, right?

82
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.717
So if we get further down the course and
you need to checkout here,

83
00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:04.055
you just right-click on that,
say Checkout and it'll take you up there.

84
00:05:04.055 --> 00:05:08.250
Right, and now my repo is in this state,
so I can see all the code in that state.

85
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.424
It might ask you if you need to stash or
something like that.

86
00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:15.330
That means you have changes that
are conflicting, just say yes,

87
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.899
please stash this for me.

88
00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:21.716
Which it 'll save all of your changes
into your stash which is here in Stashes.

89
00:05:24.564 --> 00:05:27.499
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Any questions about that?

90
00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:28.433
This will hopefully help.

91
00:05:28.433 --> 00:05:30.059
Yeah, go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If we're

92
00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:34.713
not using Sourcetree, just using
the terminal, is the branch name 1,

93
00:05:34.713 --> 00:05:35.477
2?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Mm-hm,

94
00:05:35.477 --> 00:05:36.884
that's the commit message.

95
00:05:36.884 --> 00:05:41.312
So if you wanted to do it in
the terminal you'd say, git checkout,

96
00:05:41.312 --> 00:05:43.222
then the whole hash, yeah.

97
00:05:43.222 --> 00:05:49.174
So I love Git, it's actually one of my
most favorite and least favorite tools.

98
00:05:49.174 --> 00:05:52.072
[LAUGH] It's definitely
something that I personally,

99
00:05:52.072 --> 00:05:56.360
just as a personal level suggest that you
as a developer learn to use really well.

100
00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.553
And there's an amazing course for
my co-worker, Nina Zakharenko on

101
00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:04.970
Frontend Masters that will teach you
how to use Git really, really well.

102
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.580
And it is worth your time.

103
00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.040
It's less than four hours, right?

104
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.504
So definitely, definitely check that out.

105
00:06:11.504 --> 00:06:13.820
So I do expect you to code along with me.

106
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.040
There aren't any exercises in this.

107
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.503
I found the best way to teach this
course is to just write an app together.

108
00:06:20.503 --> 00:06:24.270
Cuz I feel like writing little exercises
just doesn't really simulate what it's

109
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.840
like to build an application, and
that's what you wanna do with React.

110
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.465
So that's why we'll just be live
coding together all the time.

111
00:06:30.465 --> 00:06:34.607
And if you break something you fall
behind or anything like that, no problem,

112
00:06:34.607 --> 00:06:37.389
this is a long course, so
that's kind of expected.

113
00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.650
It'll happen to you at
least a couple of times.

114
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.644
Just feel free to just checkout the last
branch and keep going from there.

115
00:06:43.644 --> 00:06:47.809
Yeah, definitely,
definitely expected that you'll do

116
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:51.412
that.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool,

117
00:06:51.412 --> 00:06:57.069
any other questions about that?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,

118
00:06:57.069 --> 00:07:01.772
hopefully that helps you a little bit.

119
00:07:01.772 --> 00:07:05.167
So coming back here, Introduction.

120
00:07:05.167 --> 00:07:09.917
So that's why you'll see these
little tree emojis there.

121
00:07:09.917 --> 00:07:14.413
Repo link is there,
Nina's course is there, Git in-depth, and

122
00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:16.513
the Sourcetree link is there.
