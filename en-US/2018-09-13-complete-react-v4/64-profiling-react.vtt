00:00:02.424 --> 00:00:06.139
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: When you
profile an application,

2
00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:11.263
is there any specific way
you go about doing it or

3
00:00:11.263 --> 00:00:15.233
is specific to react that will help or

4
00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:20.175
do you just go do the performance tab and-
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's exactly

5
00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.250
what I was gonna pull up right now.

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.588
So they used to have these things called
React performance tools which broke with

7
00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:29.633
fiber, the React 16, cuz they
rearchitected totally how React works.

8
00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.389
And that now they basically tell
you is like if you have problems,

9
00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:35.510
you need to go to the perf tab.

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.530
Here we go.

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.620
Let's make this false too.

12
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.705
So that's really annoying.

13
00:00:41.753 --> 00:00:45.025
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what I would do now
if I was gonna do React profiling,

14
00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:48.100
I would go to the performance tab here and
Firefox.

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.340
And I would start recording performance,

16
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.620
you can do this with Chrome as
well it works almost the same way.

17
00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.110
Okay, refresh and now that it's
rendered I'm gonna say stop here.

18
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.145
And I'm going to look at, let's make
this a little bit bigger, top to bottom,

19
00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:15.876
and I really only care about this stuff
right there, so I'd zoom into that.

20
00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:18.682
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Maybe make
that a little bit smaller so

21
00:01:18.682 --> 00:01:20.130
that I can see what's going on here.

22
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.350
And you can see all of
the stuff going in here.

23
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.730
You can see the recalculate styles,
the script tag, the DOM events.

24
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:33.343
And then going in here to,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah

25
00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:37.827
just going through and go through all
of these various things to kind of see,

26
00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:40.152
we have no performance problems here.

27
00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:42.838
So this is not super interesting
to look at, but you look for

28
00:01:42.838 --> 00:01:47.130
these kind of things right here, and
then you click on the JS FlameChart.

29
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.500
This is probably the part that's
gonna be the most useful to you.

30
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.060
You can see where you'r spending time.

31
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.670
And I actually wanna maybe make
this a little bit smaller so

32
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.220
I can see some of these,
where it's really diving deep in here.

33
00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:06.760
So you can kinda click in here and

34
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.070
you can see what part of your
application is causing the slowdown.

35
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.170
Like here, you can see that this is
where React is doing the re-renders.

36
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.120
This is the workloop.

37
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.692
Then it performs a unit of work which is
how the new fiber architecture works.

38
00:02:19.692 --> 00:02:21.962
And you can see that it has
this kinda bit of a fine graph.

39
00:02:21.962 --> 00:02:26.238
But if you have a large application,
it's gonna be way deeper.
