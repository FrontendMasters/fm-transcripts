WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.303
Now, GitHub actions are super powerful.

2
00:00:01.303 --> 00:00:03.479
You can do all sorts of crazy stuff like
we

3
00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.301
talked about, but the very first one is
super easy.

4
00:00:06.301 --> 00:00:09.296
Now, to our point that we can write

5
00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:13.442
so many less tests now that we have
TypeScript.

6
00:00:13.442 --> 00:00:19.832
It would be nice to have TypeScript
validate that things were okay too.

7
00:00:19.832 --> 00:00:22.557
The easiest way to do that for most setups

8
00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:25.533
these days is to just run the build
process.

9
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.676
Well, there must be why he called it build
and test.

10
00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:35.524
And so like we can basically try to add
another step to this script, right?

11
00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:41.012
That also tries to build the application,
that will expose any kind of

12
00:00:41.012 --> 00:00:46.327
like TypeScript issues as well and will
allow us to see that as well.

13
00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:51.604
And so we wanna just add another run
command to not only do NPM test but

14
00:00:51.604 --> 00:00:56.894
then also do like NPM run build, and get
that process going as well.

15
00:00:56.894 --> 00:00:59.277
So why don't you add that in and then

16
00:00:59.277 --> 00:01:02.618
we'll take a look and we'll see it all
together?

17
00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:05.756
Cuz I'll do it too and kick it off and
then we'll

18
00:01:05.756 --> 00:01:09.147
view it and play around with it a little
bit as well.

19
00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:15.580
So the workflow that we had before called
build-and-test but it only tested.

20
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.110
So our mission was to also make it build.

21
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.557
And there's a challenge mode here, which
is like

22
00:01:24.557 --> 00:01:26.839
a segue into the next thing we'll talk
about.

23
00:01:26.839 --> 00:01:31.090
But let's just deal with the major piece,
which is also built.

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.053
Now, if you're using my repo and it's live

25
00:01:34.053 --> 00:01:36.936
there was like one issue with the type
alias

26
00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:40.300
that stopped it from building, which is
great cuz

27
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.041
now I can show you kinda the good and bad.

28
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:48.927
So this is our first one where we had that
NPM test script that exited with a one.

29
00:01:48.927 --> 00:01:53.312
Then we fixed it and then like build the
build did legit fail.

30
00:01:53.312 --> 00:01:56.245
So you can kinda see a few things, right?

31
00:01:56.245 --> 00:01:59.740
Which is one, it fails, and you can click
in.

32
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.480
This is in the Actions tab you can also
get to

33
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.906
it from the PR, where you can see okay,
here's where

34
00:02:05.906 --> 00:02:08.493
it blew up you can see all the test stuff
as

35
00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:11.871
well but that all pass, so nothing to look
at there.

36
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:17.828
But with the NPM run build, you can see
that it did blow up and the

37
00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:23.806
kinda cool thing that it will do as well
is, where did it go?

38
00:02:23.806 --> 00:02:26.029
Here it is, the annotations.

39
00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:31.200
And you might have to do some
configuration but what's really cool

40
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.571
with this is if there are lint warnings
now also see that here as well.

41
00:02:36.571 --> 00:02:41.097
It will annotate the PR with like, yeah,
this didn't break

42
00:02:41.097 --> 00:02:45.290
the build but you got a little silly thing
here, right?

43
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.917
In this case, it's just showing you,
because you think a lot of these

44
00:02:49.917 --> 00:02:55.027
stack traces have the file name and have
the line numbers and stuff like that.

45
00:02:55.027 --> 00:02:59.256
So it is able to kind of show you and it
included the error code of two.

46
00:02:59.256 --> 00:03:02.488
And so I fixed those and then I added them
to the commit.

47
00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:08.291
So we go back to actions and you can see
that it passes at this point, right?

48
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.397
You get a sense of what branch it was on,
so on and

49
00:03:11.397 --> 00:03:16.477
so forth, you can filter, in this case,
we're only doing on pull request.

50
00:03:16.477 --> 00:03:18.494
You can hear all the different statuses.

51
00:03:18.494 --> 00:03:23.406
And I will show you some of the events you
can watch for and a little bit as well.

52
00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:30.249
The branch, the actor, there is one it is
me, cool.

53
00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:34.443
So here you can see that in this case it
went successfully, which means now I

54
00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:36.906
know that hey, this built before
merging

55
00:03:36.906 --> 00:03:39.183
into main and all the tests pass, right?

56
00:03:39.183 --> 00:03:45.031
Great, now nobody has to run it manually,
or anything along those lines we now

57
00:03:45.031 --> 00:03:51.072
know with confidence that theoretically,
you can't merge bad code in the main.

58
00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:53.134
The word theoretically is doing all the
work

59
00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:55.203
in the sense because I totally can, right?

60
00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:59.862
In fact, there are no rules in this repo,
I can do whatever I want.

61
00:03:59.862 --> 00:04:03.082
And as an admin, you can always kinda do
whatever you want.

62
00:04:03.082 --> 00:04:05.291
But this is why most companies have

63
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.414
principal place access, which is at most
decent

64
00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:11.233
sized companies not even anyone on your
team

65
00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.991
has admin access to your own repo, right?

66
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:16.959
And it's to stop you from doing things
like this.

67
00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.249
Because in a lot of cases there are rules
around things you need to

68
00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:25.553
do to be compliant to its name is SOC2, is
that the one, right?

69
00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:26.986
Something, something Enron.

70
00:04:26.986 --> 00:04:28.524
So now that there are a lot of safeguards

71
00:04:28.524 --> 00:04:30.349
in place to make sure you can't do bad
things.

72
00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.437
So how do we set that up for ourselves?

73
00:04:32.437 --> 00:04:35.456
We can kinda go into the Settings and you
can also get here.

74
00:04:35.456 --> 00:04:38.878
We'll see if in the pull requests to go to
Settings, I

75
00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:42.764
go to Branches, and I have not protected
any of my branches.

76
00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:46.217
Most importantly, the main one, the
important one.

77
00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:48.710
So that's settings and branches.

78
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.033
But also I'm pretty sure if you go into
the PR, it will also

79
00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:58.080
say hey, you can have some rules here,
would you like to add a rule?

80
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.190
It's very much like you should have some
rules.

81
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.017
Which brings you to the same page, was the
one clicking on main.

82
00:05:07.017 --> 00:05:10.145
For most things with GitHub, actually I
was going to say GitHub, actually.

83
00:05:10.145 --> 00:05:12.600
This is true for most things with GitHub.

84
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:18.384
If it is open source, almost everything is
free.

85
00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:21.247
If you would like to make stuff private,
there's

86
00:05:21.247 --> 00:05:23.836
some number of minutes that you get for
free,

87
00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:26.426
I work at a SaaS company, I don't
understand

88
00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:29.241
how pricing works, even for the thing I
work on.

89
00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:33.220
But I also work on open source projects, I
don't care.

90
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.175
So here, we can do all this stuff, but if
you did make this repo private and you

91
00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:40.844
don't see the ability to do all this stuff

92
00:05:40.844 --> 00:05:44.368
like that's why, that's mostly why I
mentioned it.

93
00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:49.400
So this is the main branch and again you
can do pattern matching here as well.

94
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.923
Require pull requests before merging means
that you can't push to main.

95
00:05:54.923 --> 00:05:56.948
This one is tricky when it's a repo with
just you, but

96
00:05:56.948 --> 00:05:59.515
you're also an admin and you can bypass
that rule anytime you want.

97
00:05:59.515 --> 00:06:07.789
So you can do that or do not do it, which
is acquires approvals.

98
00:06:07.789 --> 00:06:12.654
Cool, all sorts of little rules, generally
speaking, I'm not

99
00:06:12.654 --> 00:06:16.906
gonna check most of these boxes because I
don't want to.

100
00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:24.582
Because I'm one person demoing in front of
people, but you should probably check.

101
00:06:24.582 --> 00:06:29.570
Almost all of these boxes, this one's
tricky because I tried this one one

102
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.897
time, and I wanna have it like auto-assign
the most helpful person, right?

103
00:06:34.897 --> 00:06:37.254
But that person has to do it.

104
00:06:37.254 --> 00:06:39.376
And you know what you never want is the

105
00:06:39.376 --> 00:06:42.334
person who had like code over everything
being me.

106
00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:44.946
And you never want the manager to have to

107
00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:48.599
do a report request review because he's in
meetings.

108
00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:51.693
[LAUGH] Right, and he's not the best on
that, right?

109
00:06:51.693 --> 00:06:53.185
And so I had to turn that off.

110
00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:57.082
And also we have people work in London,
yeah, it's time zones, life is hard.

111
00:06:57.082 --> 00:06:57.968
But that one, maybe not.

112
00:06:57.968 --> 00:07:00.406
And I'll talk about what you can do to
code under stuff in a second.

113
00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:05.093
&gt;&gt; For the require approvals one, is that
anybody can approve it?

114
00:07:05.093 --> 00:07:07.387
Is there a way to set it up so?

115
00:07:07.387 --> 00:07:13.714
&gt;&gt; Anyone, I believe what this one has to
be with write access to the repo, right?

116
00:07:13.714 --> 00:07:19.055
You can change the number to, I think that
they have to have-

117
00:07:19.055 --> 00:07:21.643
&gt;&gt; So anyone who can push?

118
00:07:21.643 --> 00:07:21.901
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

119
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:22.756
&gt;&gt; Okay.

120
00:07:22.756 --> 00:07:25.396
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think I could be wrong on
that one because-

121
00:07:25.396 --> 00:07:27.846
&gt;&gt; I think it's like collaborator.

122
00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:28.485
&gt;&gt; Yeah, collaborator.

123
00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:30.101
&gt;&gt; It's a permission level, yeah.

124
00:07:30.101 --> 00:07:31.310
&gt;&gt; It's not just a Rando, not a Rando.

125
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.158
&gt;&gt; So is there a way to change that?

126
00:07:34.158 --> 00:07:37.010
&gt;&gt; Not, I don't think you can change the
level.

127
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.849
&gt;&gt; That's just GitHub setting.

128
00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:39.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

129
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:39.106
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

130
00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:40.249
&gt;&gt; Okay.

131
00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:41.059
&gt;&gt; Maybe with enterprise.

132
00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:42.279
&gt;&gt; You could use code owners.

133
00:07:42.279 --> 00:07:45.108
So all kinda basically the high level.

134
00:07:45.108 --> 00:07:49.398
Yeah, it is path name, username and it
means that like if you are touching this

135
00:07:49.398 --> 00:07:51.413
file, this is really great for a mono

136
00:07:51.413 --> 00:07:54.737
repo, we have different teams contributing
the same repo.

137
00:07:54.737 --> 00:07:57.247
Which just like somebody from this team
has to be

138
00:07:57.247 --> 00:08:00.341
the one approves it on their part of the
codebase, right?

139
00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:03.007
And so you can get a little bit more
granular with who

140
00:08:03.007 --> 00:08:06.242
can do it not just anyone in the org or
anyone as collaborator.

141
00:08:06.242 --> 00:08:09.876
You can say only the people who are in
this file, can do it.

142
00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:17.398
Yeah, which again, I'm on the full team is
eight people.

143
00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:18.823
It was the eight of us, right?

144
00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:21.977
So I tried to get very specific, always
this file, I worked on

145
00:08:21.977 --> 00:08:25.512
this, so I would like it to auto-assign
me, but then it couldn't.

146
00:08:25.512 --> 00:08:28.760
And you can require a view from the code
owners.

147
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:33.894
There's nuances here, but generally
speaking, don't let people push

148
00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:38.968
main without somebody else rubber
stamping it, require approvals.

149
00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:40.443
This is the one we care about, though.

150
00:08:40.443 --> 00:08:44.205
Require status checks to pass before
merging because what is the point of

151
00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:48.163
running the test suite if you're gonna let
people merge anyway if it fails?

152
00:08:48.163 --> 00:08:49.902
Because then you've just merged failing
tests into

153
00:08:49.902 --> 00:08:51.489
main and nobody likes the person who does
that.

154
00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:57.330
This one makes sure that like you've like
rebased in main with that as well.

155
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.335
And so you've got like the latest version
of main that you're

156
00:09:02.335 --> 00:09:07.537
based off of it's not like an old version,
and so on and so forth.

157
00:09:07.537 --> 00:09:12.436
Cool, and you can pick which checks, and
hypothetically yep, I have

158
00:09:12.436 --> 00:09:16.601
one which is built-and-test, which is run
by GitHub actions.

159
00:09:16.601 --> 00:09:19.207
And that will say cool, before you can

160
00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:22.721
merge into main, this check has to pass,
right?

161
00:09:22.721 --> 00:09:25.817
Now, admins, not as clever as admins can

162
00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:29.716
always override this and lisences a
personal repo.

163
00:09:29.716 --> 00:09:32.422
I'm setting up a lot of rules that don't
apply to

164
00:09:32.422 --> 00:09:35.594
me as the only person who can collaborate
with this repo.

165
00:09:35.594 --> 00:09:39.174
There's some other ones in here, and these
are, again, these

166
00:09:39.174 --> 00:09:43.036
fall when we talked about that systems,
process and then patterns.

167
00:09:43.036 --> 00:09:46.573
This comes down to a lot more of the
process piece, whether or not

168
00:09:46.573 --> 00:09:50.781
you choose to use code owners or something
like that, it's like a process.

169
00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:54.650
This one, if you've seen like comments can
get resolved in the

170
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:59.040
threads, this is say all comments need to
have hit the resolve button.

171
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.688
So you can't be like, you should change
this and then somebody else

172
00:10:02.688 --> 00:10:06.921
comes in and approves it, and then you
just ignore that other person, right?

173
00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:10.338
Sign commits are if you do it from the UI,
they're signed.

174
00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:13.245
But otherwise, you need to get a cert.

175
00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:17.382
Yeah, lots of like ways that you can tweek
this.

176
00:10:17.382 --> 00:10:21.886
Every box you check add safety, except for
the lock branch, which

177
00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:26.327
just makes it, I guess lock branch makes
it really safe, right?

178
00:10:26.327 --> 00:10:28.245
Because it means it can't change.

179
00:10:28.245 --> 00:10:33.163
Yeah, this, yeah, this one, actually will
stop you from being able to break

180
00:10:33.163 --> 00:10:37.130
your own rules, but then you could also
turn it off as an admin.

181
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:43.098
So [LAUGH] yes, you can lock the door that
you have the key too.

182
00:10:43.098 --> 00:10:45.896
Yeah, obviously, every box you check has a
certain

183
00:10:45.896 --> 00:10:48.895
level of safety and a certain amount of
hassle, right?

184
00:10:48.895 --> 00:10:53.115
So this is a process piece of how do you
manage a team, managing a

185
00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:57.912
code base, both either as a member of the
team or the leader of the team.

186
00:10:57.912 --> 00:11:03.390
It's like figuring out what level you're
comfortable with.

187
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:07.062
Now, to be clear, it is very tempting to
be

188
00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:11.348
all New Year's Eve about this or New
Year's Day.

189
00:11:11.348 --> 00:11:18.027
Which is it's a new era of quality in our
code base and check every single box

190
00:11:18.027 --> 00:11:21.314
and put on draconian and it's a great

191
00:11:21.314 --> 00:11:25.997
way to have a small-scale revolution on
your team.

192
00:11:25.997 --> 00:11:28.371
It is like the natural inclination, it's
like,

193
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:30.858
I found out about these features, we're
gonna have

194
00:11:30.858 --> 00:11:33.628
the best process ever, I'm gonna make
everything safe,

195
00:11:33.628 --> 00:11:35.621
and then there will be riots in your team.

196
00:11:35.621 --> 00:11:38.884
So my suggestion that you didn't ask for
is

197
00:11:38.884 --> 00:11:42.427
the obvious ones of make sure the checks
pass.

198
00:11:42.427 --> 00:11:44.439
I think everyone could be on the same page

199
00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:47.347
with this, don't merge failing tests or a
broken build.

200
00:11:47.347 --> 00:11:52.475
That one seems non-controversial to me,
right?

201
00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:55.436
Somebody should review this PR before I
just

202
00:11:55.436 --> 00:11:59.367
open and merge it myself seems
non-controversial to me.

203
00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:01.702
If we want later I can pull up my own repo
and see which ones

204
00:12:01.702 --> 00:12:04.803
I like, some of them have been checked and
unchecked by people on my team.

205
00:12:04.803 --> 00:12:07.843
[LAUGH] Right, and so we can see what the
current state

206
00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:11.239
of the world is if somebody's interested
in a little bit.

207
00:12:11.239 --> 00:12:13.675
Cool, and then you can see I can turn off
the

208
00:12:13.675 --> 00:12:16.930
ability of what I just did earlier, which
is force push.

209
00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:18.820
Again, sometimes you need these things.

210
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.490
But I would start small and build it up
and you can create this.

211
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:28.039
Cool, so now I've got these branch
protection rules in place,

212
00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:33.846
and now I can't merge a broken build in,
review is required.

213
00:12:33.846 --> 00:12:35.317
Did I check the box?

214
00:12:35.317 --> 00:12:38.617
Not allowing me to do that, which is going
to become problematic

215
00:12:38.617 --> 00:12:41.809
for me in a little bit because ain't
nobody else in this repo.

216
00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:43.918
That's the thing that I will have to
address at

217
00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:46.200
some point, but at least I demoed that it
worked.
