00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.790
Let's talk a little bit
about component testing.

2
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.451
So, component testing is that kind of next
level up from the hierarchy from unit

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.576
testing, right?

4
00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:09.866
Unit testing's a breez easy call function.

5
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:14.636
Did you get what you expected to get?

6
00:00:14.636 --> 00:00:19.570
That works, and
component testing is the next

7
00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.881
phase up from there, which is run code.

8
00:00:23.881 --> 00:00:28.330
But for coding,
you can't just call as a function.

9
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.149
Write code that has one very
specific side effect, right?

10
00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.154
Technically, I guess React functions or

11
00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:43.588
React components are these days functions,

12
00:00:43.588 --> 00:00:47.878
and I'm sure you could call them but

13
00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:52.319
good luck testing on click handler.

14
00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.603
You know what I mean, right?

15
00:00:53.603 --> 00:00:59.044
For those kind of more important pieces,
could unit test a reaction component?

16
00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:00.586
Yes.

17
00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:03.439
Should you?

18
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.614
Probably not.

19
00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:11.495
Somebody's gonna have an important
use case, and yes, then do it.

20
00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:15.663
But for the most part, we're trying to
say, hey, I am willing to take on some

21
00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:19.773
additional complexity, and what I would
like in return for that additional

22
00:01:19.773 --> 00:01:24.295
complexity is something a little closer to
the real world usage of this component.

23
00:01:24.295 --> 00:01:26.332
So yes, you could unit test it.

24
00:01:26.332 --> 00:01:31.459
But you are being like, I would like
to very complicated do that React,

25
00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.635
create element dance and all those things.

26
00:01:34.635 --> 00:01:39.413
What we really wanna do is we wanna see,
hey, is this button disabled?

27
00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:42.642
I did these DOM changes work
the way I wanted them to?

28
00:01:42.642 --> 00:01:47.839
If it is make sure
the password certain length

29
00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:53.188
before you enable the submit button,
right?

30
00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:59.771
Generally speaking, you are going to
need to hand it to react dom.render.

31
00:01:59.771 --> 00:02:00.944
That's not the name of it anymore.

32
00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:05.033
Great route.

33
00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.368
And actually be able to use these things.

34
00:02:07.368 --> 00:02:13.207
Now, the true other end of the spectrum as
we saw before, was that kinda integration

35
00:02:13.207 --> 00:02:18.650
end testing where build the thing,
fired up in a browser, click the buttons.

36
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.815
That is the truest version of that, but
you do have to download said browsers,

37
00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:28.997
start upset browsers, build asset load
into page, not as fast as a unit test.

38
00:02:28.997 --> 00:02:33.582
Component tests seek to get
you somewhere in the middle.

39
00:02:33.582 --> 00:02:38.080
I am not,

40
00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:46.452
I think if I was, for instance,
building a design system,

41
00:02:46.452 --> 00:02:52.454
right, I think that I would
use a lot of component tests.

42
00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:56.475
Even there are ways to integrate
your testing with storybooks,

43
00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.120
stuff along those lines.

44
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.098
There's a lot of use cases if you
wanna get a lot of the functionality

45
00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:05.469
of individual pieces, right?

46
00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:09.859
Insofar that I work on open source project
where we are kind of eventually gonna have

47
00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.496
an extensible UI and the ability to
have plugins and stuff like that,

48
00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:17.029
we will probably take pieces of UI and
make it into a design system.

49
00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:21.950
At which point like yeah, that was
lightning fast run through them all,

50
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.248
make total sense.

51
00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:26.123
However, we should go through,
we should look at this.

52
00:03:26.123 --> 00:03:29.299
You might decide yes, this hits
the value prop here is amazing for

53
00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.928
the things that I'm working on.

54
00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:31.616
Awesome.

55
00:03:31.616 --> 00:03:37.358
I have worked on applications
where our component testing was,

56
00:03:37.358 --> 00:03:42.886
cuz we had a lot of that Cypress tests and
unit test coverage and

57
00:03:42.886 --> 00:03:46.729
the value add just wasn't there, right?

58
00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:51.652
The goal here is as we think
about these enterprise UI apps or

59
00:03:51.652 --> 00:03:56.577
development is we have an arsenal
of tools that is useful for

60
00:03:56.577 --> 00:04:01.813
the various ways in which the apps
we work on are weird, right?

61
00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:03.006
In this course,

62
00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:08.570
we have left the this is what you should
do all the time area of the world.

63
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.945
Yeah, you should have tests, but
that's news flash for nobody.

64
00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:15.875
Here's a set of very specialized tooling

65
00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:20.490
that you can use to solve whatever
problem that you have, right?

66
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.487
Maybe the act of spinning up,
maybe you're inside of a much larger

67
00:04:25.487 --> 00:04:29.693
application, something,
something microfinance.

68
00:04:29.693 --> 00:04:34.379
And even spinning it up in Cypress or

69
00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.605
Playwright is like untenable.

70
00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:41.775
Maybe you just have a really,
really, really complicated form and

71
00:04:41.775 --> 00:04:44.723
having to spin up the entire app
with all of its dependencies and

72
00:04:44.723 --> 00:04:48.339
mock out everything so that you can test
all the form validation and whether or

73
00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:51.759
not certain things appear in certain
states is just not worth it for you.

74
00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.875
And too much of a hassle, then
component testing is great, right, and

75
00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:57.396
you should totally do it.

76
00:04:57.396 --> 00:05:00.687
And if you have a thing where it's
very easy to spin up everything and

77
00:05:00.687 --> 00:05:02.841
point a browser at it,
you might not use it.

78
00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:07.675
Those are both really, really,
really reasonable takes,

79
00:05:07.675 --> 00:05:10.529
and you have both at your disposal.
