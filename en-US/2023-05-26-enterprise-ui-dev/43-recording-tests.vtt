1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.413
As we showed before, I can go and
pick something here as well and

2
00:00:04.413 --> 00:00:08.428
get that, and it'll put it on
my clipboard for me to use.

3
00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:11.967
That is great, and
then I can see the visual feedback.

4
00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:16.717
But on the theme, cuz again, like I
said before, I think that Playwright is

5
00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:20.891
probably a course in and of itself,
or a workshop in and of itself.

6
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:25.801
But in the terms of like, I need sanity
around my app cuz I'm tired of getting

7
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.792
paged, and
I need to do this big refactor, and

8
00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:32.276
I need to put some of this
stuff in place ASAP, right?

9
00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:34.969
And I understand the trade-offs from
unit tests all the way through,

10
00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:35.660
I'm here for it.

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.443
I think one of the most powerful
things that you can do with this,

12
00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:42.260
is you've got record at cursor and
record new.

13
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.900
Let's do record new, that way I don't
have to worry where my cursor is.

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.451
And it spins up a browser,

15
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:53.137
we will go to localhost 3000.

16
00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:56.302
Would you wanna, maybe,
just change that to the slash?

17
00:00:56.302 --> 00:00:58.983
Probably, right,
if you had the base URL set.

18
00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:02.582
There are little things you might want
to tweak, but go in here, click on that,

19
00:01:02.582 --> 00:01:05.354
type in, we want a Charizard,
that's what we wanted before?

20
00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:09.016
Charizard, we click that.

21
00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:10.759
We'll see it rendered on the page.

22
00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.162
There's not a lot of
other stuff to clicks.

23
00:01:12.162 --> 00:01:14.012
Let's go over to secret menu.

24
00:01:14.012 --> 00:01:15.912
You could literally spin this up,

25
00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:19.260
just drive through your entire
app in one mega test, right?

26
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.689
Just in terms of sanity check we'll
go pick KFC, by the way, when I talk

27
00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.663
about things I do when I should be working
on my workshop, finding a dataset for

28
00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:35.392
all of the secret menu items at
all the fast food restaurants.

29
00:01:35.392 --> 00:01:40.453
And then massaging and
parsing that data into a table, and

30
00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:45.733
then building stupid rating sliders,
is a thing that I did.

31
00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:52.777
[LAUGH] Right,
because that was the best use of my time.

32
00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:58.554
And yeah, the fact that there's table div
scroll, that didn't happen on its own.

33
00:01:58.554 --> 00:01:59.588
And what else can we do?

34
00:01:59.588 --> 00:02:00.810
We go in here.

35
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.495
Let's go sign up for an account.

36
00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:04.871
I have made so many weird email addresses.

37
00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:07.402
And I get that feedback
of what everything is.

38
00:02:07.402 --> 00:02:12.204
Let's say live coding, because there's
definitely no way that I did that earlier,

39
00:02:12.204 --> 00:02:13.147
@gmail.com.

40
00:02:13.147 --> 00:02:15.407
This doesn't send any emails.

41
00:02:15.407 --> 00:02:19.411
&gt;&gt; Is the scrollable table div accessible?

42
00:02:19.411 --> 00:02:20.566
&gt;&gt; I have no idea.

43
00:02:20.566 --> 00:02:22.369
This is mostly I wonder
if table divs can scroll.

44
00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.641
&gt;&gt; I wanna do that, but I don't think
the accessibility team would like that.

45
00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:26.408
Tom.

46
00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:30.702
&gt;&gt; The best part is I was talking, I don't
even remember what email and password I

47
00:02:30.702 --> 00:02:35.403
used, but luckily if you look over to the
right, this entire test is being recorded.

48
00:02:35.403 --> 00:02:37.980
So I could theoretically
look at my own thing.

49
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.547
Okay, there's some stuff
in the database over here,

50
00:02:41.547 --> 00:02:44.658
I would really like to
see what I'm doing here.

51
00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:49.631
So we can go ahead,
I can write a new thing which is,

52
00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:54.275
restarting computers is the best,
hit Enter.

53
00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:55.943
There it is.

54
00:02:55.943 --> 00:03:00.102
This is in case I wanted to tweet and
I have something stupid to say,

55
00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:03.540
I can just write it in this app and
everything's fine.

56
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.197
Updated, given maybe an exclamation
point or two, maybe not.

57
00:03:08.197 --> 00:03:11.351
I found how to bug him out,
right, I can't edit that.

58
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.286
We'll go close out, then we will sign out.

59
00:03:15.286 --> 00:03:17.345
I don't know, whatever you wanna do.

60
00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:19.044
I think I've made my point.

61
00:03:19.044 --> 00:03:23.592
So then we can go back here and
we can hit Cancel.

62
00:03:23.592 --> 00:03:29.729
And what you see,
it's possibly the ramblings of a madman.

63
00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:36.163
But in a lot of ways, effectively the test
it does, cover a lot of my app, right?

64
00:03:36.163 --> 00:03:41.176
And gives me, at least in terms of like,
hey, is this thing doing the thing?

65
00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:42.007
Is it running?

66
00:03:42.007 --> 00:03:43.473
Can I navigate around?

67
00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.840
Am I seeing the things I'm
supposed to see, right?

68
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.087
When I do that much,
well, maybe pausing and

69
00:03:49.087 --> 00:03:53.624
do a few expectations every once
in a while, I probably would.

70
00:03:53.624 --> 00:03:56.594
There are things that you need to fill in,
in my experience, and

71
00:03:56.594 --> 00:03:59.900
it might just be my bad coding, but
I had to change some of these to type.

72
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.590
It also helps me figure out where my

73
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.803
locators are less than ideal.

74
00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:13.266
That's because there should be no
dash in between those two, right?

75
00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:17.033
So also like a great sanity check, cuz
I didn't know that I made that boo-boo,

76
00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.918
you would have watched me try to type and
not have it not work.

77
00:04:19.918 --> 00:04:24.149
I changed this to just a slash, so
on and so forth, all sorts of stuff.

78
00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:26.227
There was just random stuff that I, well,

79
00:04:26.227 --> 00:04:28.787
I didn't really know what
password I was gonna use.

80
00:04:28.787 --> 00:04:30.429
There you go, wow!

81
00:04:30.429 --> 00:04:32.138
&gt;&gt; I noticed you had deleted
one of your passwords.

82
00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:36.823
Looks like that Line 19 there right above
your cursor, Meta+a, is that a delete key?

83
00:04:36.823 --> 00:04:39.131
&gt;&gt; That's a command I have for select all.

84
00:04:39.131 --> 00:04:40.759
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right?

85
00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.276
&gt;&gt; And then you just typed over it, I see.

86
00:04:42.276 --> 00:04:43.729
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was talking, I was like,

87
00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.001
I wonder how many letters I hit I don't
remember, let me start over, right?

88
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.564
So yeah, you would probably
do some cleaning up here.

89
00:04:49.564 --> 00:04:52.606
But in terms of verifying
that all the stuff in place,

90
00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:57.012
can you click these things, can you
navigate, and stuff along those lines.

91
00:04:57.012 --> 00:05:04.441
This will get you a lot of bang for a
relatively small buck relatively quickly.

92
00:05:04.441 --> 00:05:08.440
And since it will go anywhere on
the Internet, you can drive a browser,

93
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.385
you can use that information for
anything you want.

94
00:05:11.385 --> 00:05:14.093
And even with GitHub workflows,
you can schedule them.

95
00:05:14.093 --> 00:05:16.321
I don't know when tickets go on sale.

96
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:20.652
Whatever, all sorts of stuff
that you can do, Justin.

97
00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:23.248
&gt;&gt; How would you do this if you're
not using the VS Code plugin?

98
00:05:23.248 --> 00:05:25.450
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you definitely don't
have to do the VS Code plugin.

99
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.229
The nice part is there's the record new,
which will make a new file.

100
00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.484
Cuz these are all protocols in actually
Playwright in driving Chromium itself.

101
00:05:34.484 --> 00:05:36.514
A lot of that stuff is cool.

102
00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:41.474
There are reasons why you might not want
to do it from here other than the fact

103
00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:45.989
that, like I said before,
this extension is somewhat wonderful.

104
00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:48.869
But also did cause me to
have to restart my computer

105
00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:52.102
cuz I had some errant process
that I couldn't kill off.

106
00:05:52.102 --> 00:06:00.242
So if you want to do it
from the command line,

107
00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:07.503
you can do npx playwright and codegen.

108
00:06:07.503 --> 00:06:12.245
And this will kinda start up
the Playwright inspector, which will look

109
00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:19.999
somewhat similar with a record button,
That you can turn off and on.

110
00:06:22.876 --> 00:06:24.676
So we'll go ahead,
get everything where I want.

111
00:06:24.676 --> 00:06:30.193
I can hit Record, I can go here, I can
navigate around, I can do some things.

112
00:06:33.944 --> 00:06:40.340
Close that modal, so on and so forth, and
get a lot of this stuff in place as well.

113
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.849
And then you could copy this.

114
00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:47.510
The other thing is this will set
up a Playwright test for you.

115
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:53.678
Also, Playwright supports these other
languages that I don't care about.

116
00:06:53.678 --> 00:06:57.080
You could also, if you wanna, actually
just run it as a script that controls

117
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.549
a browser, you can switch it to library,
and this will now be a node package.

118
00:07:00.549 --> 00:07:04.767
You can just do node, whatever, and
it will do all of this stuff for you for

119
00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:09.487
various non-descript reasons that you
might choose to have happen in your life.
