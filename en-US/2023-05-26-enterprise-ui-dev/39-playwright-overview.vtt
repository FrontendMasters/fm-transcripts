00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.380
This last leg of this workshop is called,
things that Steve is really excited about,

2
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.850
mock service worker.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.910
Let's talk about Playwright.

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.750
So we talked a lot about the unit tests.

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.400
Great, fast, awesome.

6
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.930
Not super great forgetting that
sanity check very early on

7
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.644
when you are either,
maybe it's a bad code base of your own,

8
00:00:22.644 --> 00:00:26.910
maybe you're responsible,
maybe you inherited it.

9
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.766
I'm saying that you inherited it
just to give everyone a feeling, but

10
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:34.417
some of you are like, no, I did this.

11
00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:35.514
Honestly, to be clear,

12
00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.029
there's a lot of reasons why your test
coverage might suck that are your fault.

13
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.566
A lot of reasons why your test coverage
might be bad that's your fault,

14
00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.594
but then choosing editing
which one they like.

15
00:00:47.594 --> 00:00:52.779
I think a lot about like a year ago we
we did this rush to build out this Admin

16
00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:58.477
dashboard for managing a whole bunch of
stuff around our SaaS product, right?

17
00:00:58.477 --> 00:01:01.387
Because previously if you wanted to add
a user, you follow Zendesk ticket and

18
00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:02.699
someone from engineering did it.

19
00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.961
There's a cap on how many customers we
can onboard when you're doing stuff

20
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:06.854
manually, right?

21
00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:09.410
And it was uncalled for
the cloud team was terrible.

22
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.150
So we chose to do one of those mad dashes,
right, and get some stuff done.

23
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.166
And the APIs came late, as I joked
about before, but we had stuff, so

24
00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.170
we were good but integration was hard.

25
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.080
But we were also still figuring out,
the designs were changing.

26
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.140
So did we write really great tests?

27
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.230
No, because we didn't even know
the full shape of the thing yet, right?

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.375
And like, yeah, we threw it
together somewhat quickly, right?

29
00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:34.045
And so there have been times, honestly,

30
00:01:34.045 --> 00:01:37.554
in the last nine months that
I have been responsible for

31
00:01:37.554 --> 00:01:42.530
code bases that I would be embarrassed
about demoing in front of you, right?

32
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.175
And for really good reasons that I'm
very comfortable with having made,

33
00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:47.305
absolutely, right?

34
00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:50.613
So then the question is like how do
you actually know this thing works in

35
00:01:50.613 --> 00:01:52.476
the perspective of a customer or user?

36
00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:57.137
And then also the way that I'm mostly
going to kind of spin this because

37
00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:00.070
again we did an entire
workshop on Cypress.

38
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.270
We should probably do an entire
one on Playwright at some point.

39
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.100
Right, talk to Mark.

40
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.754
But the theme that we're
gonna kinda focus on here for

41
00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:15.340
our purposes is how do we use this tool?

42
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.578
To the question someone said
before about what 20% and

43
00:02:18.578 --> 00:02:20.808
what 80% are you covering, right?

44
00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.461
How can we use this tool for

45
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:28.772
rapidly getting some sanity
around this code base?

46
00:02:28.772 --> 00:02:32.680
And so we're not gonna go all the way
into everything Playwright does.

47
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.127
We are going to do the high level of,

48
00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:41.100
here is the 20% that you need to know
that will make your life a lot easier.

49
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.339
And then we can kind of
build on it from there.

50
00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:52.060
So, with that, let's do a quick like just
read everyone on what Playwright is.

51
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.740
The prior iterations of Playwright
have gone by other names.

52
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.980
I mean,
they've been different technologies.

53
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.582
You might have used like WebDriver.io,

54
00:03:04.582 --> 00:03:11.955
Selenium which is the Jenkins of
why I'm gonna get so many emails.

55
00:03:11.955 --> 00:03:16.610
There's Selenium,
there's WebDriver, Cypress,

56
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.048
Playwright is the latest hotness and for

57
00:03:20.048 --> 00:03:24.512
good merit right now just
because it's the newest.

58
00:03:24.512 --> 00:03:29.507
There is a protocol for
interaction and driving Chrome.

59
00:03:29.507 --> 00:03:32.742
It's either the Chrome Developer, a CDP,

60
00:03:32.742 --> 00:03:36.160
kind of basically driving
operating Chrome.

61
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.380
It's like if you use like puppeteer,
the same basic kind of concept.

62
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.821
That team I believe it's at least
somewhat owned as a strong word

63
00:03:44.821 --> 00:03:47.466
maintained by Microsoft this point.

64
00:03:47.466 --> 00:03:52.492
But the team did work to kind
of build the same bindings for

65
00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:55.843
Firefox and even WebKit/Safari, so

66
00:03:55.843 --> 00:04:00.345
you can drive all these
things based on the modern,

67
00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:04.130
latest and greatest JavaScript tooling.

68
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.253
Cuz I was like I've joked and
alluded too between ES modules and

69
00:04:09.253 --> 00:04:12.050
TypesSripty stuff, right?

70
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.999
The ecosystem has like done one of
those like giant quantum leaps in

71
00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.819
the last few years where
even just in Cypress and

72
00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:23.333
I to be clear I still have a slightly
older version of Cypress like things that

73
00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:27.030
don't support ES modules like
Storybook was guilty of this.

74
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.786
There's a lot of things that basically
became untenable in modern apps because

75
00:04:30.786 --> 00:04:34.200
they were built on common js cuz
that's what existed at the time.

76
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.010
So in a new app I would definitely say
stuff that if it were a modern app, cool.

77
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.643
You might still choose to use like all
this stuff will work too with the older

78
00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:43.710
stuff as well.

79
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.830
But, so it does bring a lot of that
modern module system build processes to

80
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.010
the table.

81
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:56.441
It also does drive Firefox and even Safari
cuz Safari is a weird one these days.

82
00:04:56.441 --> 00:04:59.499
And allows you to do a bunch
of really great stuff for

83
00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:03.781
basically spinning up a bunch of browsers,
navigating through them.

84
00:05:03.781 --> 00:05:05.960
And kind of kicking the tires on it.

85
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.800
And like I said, honestly a few
really good integration tests.

86
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.585
So one of the questions from the chat
before if they break, won't give you

87
00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:18.448
a lot of insight to why they broke cuz
they are far from the implementation.

88
00:05:18.448 --> 00:05:23.208
But a few really good browser based
integration tests will at least

89
00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:27.294
give you the confidence that
everything works, right?

90
00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:28.350
Not a lot of insight when it doesn't.

91
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.037
But giving you a lot of confidence that
things actually work the way that you want

92
00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:38.531
and getting you to the point where you
can start on that large scale refactor.

93
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:43.173
And trying to pay down that tech debt
without losing your mind in the process.
