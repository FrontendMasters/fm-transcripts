00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.953
Component testing, like I said,

2
00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:09.147
seeks to hit that sweet
spot of fast unit test,

3
00:00:09.147 --> 00:00:12.477
but from a user perspective,

4
00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:16.885
what you actually care about, right?

5
00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:20.890
And yeah, you can argue it
either hits that happy medium or

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.272
does neither particularly well.

7
00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:27.397
I think, yeah, that's kind of
how it works and both are true.

8
00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:31.738
And that's why it is one part
of your testing portfolio,

9
00:00:31.738 --> 00:00:34.550
your testing toolkit, if you will.

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.419
So we're going to kinda jump in just
into another example that has a few

11
00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:41.270
more things kinda going on.

12
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.693
We have another example in
source examples packing list and

13
00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:53.300
this is kinda one to-do list is been
overdone in terms of demo apps.

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.670
What about two lists and
things moving back and forth between them.

15
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.390
So there's a way to kind of move some
stuff around and figure some things out.

16
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.582
I alluded to this earlier, so
I will kinda call it out now

17
00:01:08.582 --> 00:01:13.553
that second bullet with
the button being disabled and

18
00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:20.201
enabled more actually really a third,
but the enabling of the button.

19
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:24.311
In my experience at
the time of this recording,

20
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:30.395
wasn't correctly working with
Happy DOM and was working with JSDOM.

21
00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:33.918
So if you've kind of I have
JSDOM as the default, but

22
00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:38.962
if you at some point change that just
because, and you find it not working,

23
00:01:38.962 --> 00:01:42.912
just make sure using JSDOM and
everything should be good.

24
00:01:42.912 --> 00:01:46.800
The next part is both
are available in most situations so

25
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.690
you can use whichever one and
kind of choose along those lines as well.

26
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.981
But yeah, basically we've got this list.

27
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:56.925
I'll kinda show it to you real quick so

28
00:01:56.925 --> 00:02:00.801
we can kinda get a sense
of what we're looking at.

29
00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:04.641
And this is true for
everything in this case.

30
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:13.250
We can go in enterprise ui
development, and we do an NPM start.

31
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.480
If we go here,
you can see basically all of the little

32
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.910
demo apps are simultaneously together.

33
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.326
So if you look,
this is the app right here,

34
00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:29.630
where we can have some things
like I should bring my phone.

35
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.460
You can see the button kind of enable, and
then we can edit it, and we can save it,

36
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.443
and we can mark it and
it goes to the packed items and

37
00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:42.370
we can mark everything as unpacked and
everything moves back over that first one.

38
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.980
If we had two things,
you can see it a little bit better.

39
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.360
iPhone charger, that's important.

40
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.500
We can move them, we can unpack
everything, we can add new stuff,

41
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.930
we can remove things from the list, right?

42
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.298
So this case, this is the little sample
app that we're playing around with,

43
00:02:59.298 --> 00:03:03.674
but at the same time this could
just be a component in your larger

44
00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:05.840
application as well.

45
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.068
And so what we wanna do is in
the kind of exercise itself,

46
00:03:09.068 --> 00:03:13.121
I have just a few initial things that
we might try to do to just kind of get

47
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:17.410
the hang of some component testing
that's more than just a single click.

48
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.530
We're now checking to see if
things are enabled or disabled.

49
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.616
Give you a hint there's
a match over there for that.

50
00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:27.531
And kind of a few more nuances of
like better simulate a few more

51
00:03:27.531 --> 00:03:32.277
of the interactions that you may have
that kind of barring network requests

52
00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:37.173
kinda get us more towards the full picture
of render a component into the DOM,

53
00:03:37.173 --> 00:03:41.955
but not really the DOM, the fake DOM
that's a lot faster in a not browser.

54
00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:46.147
Kind of manipulating it verifying that
things are where they should be and

55
00:03:46.147 --> 00:03:47.578
getting a sense of that.

56
00:03:47.578 --> 00:03:51.739
So when you spend about probably 10
minutes to just get familiar and

57
00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.536
comfortable and
then we will do it together and

58
00:03:54.536 --> 00:03:59.437
then talk about anything that came up or
any questions that you have around that.
