1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.449
We will make a new test file.

2
00:00:05.449 --> 00:00:07.785
I mean,
I could write in this one too, but,

3
00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:18.695
I do pokemon.spec.ts.

4
00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:21.209
Out of the box, it uses spec.

5
00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:22.877
Could you change that?

6
00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.061
You could.

7
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.004
Why am I using spec?

8
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:29.467
Because Vitest was looking for
test [LAUGH], right?

9
00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:33.125
And so by the file name,
Playwright will run the spec files,

10
00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.805
if I just run the test files,
and never the twain shall meet.

11
00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:42.168
If you don't like spec and you don't
have Vitest, do whatever you want.

12
00:00:42.168 --> 00:00:43.895
Change it to whatever makes you happy.

13
00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:48.646
That right now makes me fairly happy as we

14
00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:53.131
kind of go through and we do our thing.

15
00:00:53.131 --> 00:00:58.095
Cool, it's got that base one in there.

16
00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:02.063
So I'm gonna spin up my app real quick so

17
00:01:02.063 --> 00:01:10.045
we can take a look at it, And
make sure it works before I start.

18
00:01:10.045 --> 00:01:12.553
I started testing out but
I pulled the wrong repo.

19
00:01:12.553 --> 00:01:18.041
So there are a bunch of different
apps that you can choose to test.

20
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:22.415
Basically it's got just dumb
stuff to play around in, right?

21
00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.079
This is basically my sample playground.

22
00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.301
We're not gonna do everything in here,
but if you want to try different things,

23
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:33.655
that's why it puts a stupid toast
notification that vanishes,

24
00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:35.223
all sorts of stuff like that.

25
00:01:35.223 --> 00:01:40.188
As a fun playground,
this is my perverse idea of fun.

26
00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:44.809
It's got file downloads, it's got
everything you could possibly want.

27
00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:50.421
It says, input obstacles from before
that you can drive and do things with.

28
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:54.307
This is actually the one that
has a database and has auth, so

29
00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:57.510
you can log in and sign up and
analyze the cookie.

30
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.385
So if you want to try out stuff like,
again, if we do a full version of this, we

31
00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:07.562
can go all the way in, this is the Pokeman
search, which is the one I'm gonna try out.

32
00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:11.229
And you will also notice that the query
param automatically updates, so

33
00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.104
I could test stuff like that as well.

34
00:02:13.104 --> 00:02:15.453
I have full control over the browser.

35
00:02:15.453 --> 00:02:18.089
I don't have to use JS DOM or
anything along those lines.

36
00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:22.049
I can see stuff, it's like a full on spa.

37
00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.937
I think some of them are server-side
rendered where I can see views

38
00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:26.846
within views.

39
00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:30.487
You can get facts about dogs, right?

40
00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:34.837
So if you wanna step out different network
requests, you can play and put this on,

41
00:02:34.837 --> 00:02:36.928
I think you can write to the clipboard.

42
00:02:36.928 --> 00:02:39.397
All those things are things
you can test in Playwright.

43
00:02:39.397 --> 00:02:40.801
Obviously, I'm gonna do all those.

44
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:46.045
My goal today is to show you how you might
weaponize this tool to get as much sanity

45
00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:50.839
around your gnarly codebase as you
possibly can as quickly as possible.

46
00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:55.394
With that, we'll go through writing
a test real quick, and then I will show

47
00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:59.734
you that for our purposes when it comes
to the theme of our time together,

48
00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:02.026
we're not gonna write that many tests.

49
00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:06.141
And I will show you why I think that
for getting sanity around your

50
00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:06.846
code base.

51
00:03:06.846 --> 00:03:09.383
I am now thinking that maybe I should
just open the workshop with this,

52
00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:11.323
but then it would have made
everything else less fun.

53
00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:14.819
So this feels like a crescendo at the end.

54
00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:22.188
Cool, so let's go ahead and look at
kinda some of the differences here.

55
00:03:22.188 --> 00:03:26.241
Your test and expect, this one come
from Playwright test instead of Vitest.

56
00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:32.522
You don't have a describe because it's
test.describe does the same thing.

57
00:03:32.522 --> 00:03:36.972
We'll grab those and we will do test.

58
00:03:36.972 --> 00:03:40.823
It has an input field,

59
00:03:40.823 --> 00:03:45.064
input field-
&gt;&gt; Could you use it instead of test here?

60
00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:47.720
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.

61
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.591
Yeah, now I know that because I tried that
earlier today cuz I expected someone would

62
00:03:51.591 --> 00:03:52.637
ask me that question.

63
00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:56.175
There's the things that you just do,
and then when you're preparing for

64
00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:58.873
these things,
what questions are people gonna ask me?

65
00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:06.268
Yeah, input field for
searching for pokemans.

66
00:04:06.268 --> 00:04:08.020
Cool and that's an async function.

67
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.273
Also in the other repo,
I gave you some code snippets so

68
00:04:12.273 --> 00:04:15.148
you never have to do stuff like that.

69
00:04:15.148 --> 00:04:19.613
You could steal them, they are there as
a hidden treat in the VS Code directory.

70
00:04:19.613 --> 00:04:24.500
It has an input, For pokemans.

71
00:04:27.098 --> 00:04:30.122
Awesome, I should have actually
called it Pokemans, so

72
00:04:30.122 --> 00:04:33.148
I don't get a seasoned letter,
but here we are.

73
00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:38.296
Awesome, so what will we seek to do here?

74
00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.694
Let's write a simple test.

75
00:04:42.694 --> 00:04:47.615
And so, first thing we wanna do is,
did I put the base URL on?

76
00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:53.013
This is one of those things where
I'm going where the spirit takes me.

77
00:04:53.013 --> 00:04:54.274
Did I set a base?

78
00:04:54.274 --> 00:04:55.035
Yeah, I did.

79
00:04:55.035 --> 00:04:56.268
Look at me go.

80
00:04:56.268 --> 00:05:01.707
Awesome, so we'll start with await

81
00:05:01.707 --> 00:05:06.799
page.goto("/pokeman-search").

82
00:05:09.046 --> 00:05:14.038
Right, that's an argument
that gets passed in here.

83
00:05:14.038 --> 00:05:15.813
There are no globals to speak of.

84
00:05:15.813 --> 00:05:19.706
Honestly, for a smoke test,

85
00:05:19.706 --> 00:05:25.795
[LAUGH] did your server start up at all,
right?

86
00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:30.298
Cool, and then we can go ahead,
I can run it.

87
00:05:30.298 --> 00:05:33.157
We did have that failing
test in there intentionally.

88
00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:35.150
That's what was hanging out for
those 30 seconds.

89
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.645
It's because I literally had that
test where I tried to make it fail.

90
00:05:38.645 --> 00:05:40.296
So we'll go ahead and get rid of that one.

91
00:05:40.296 --> 00:05:42.555
Let's get rid of that file completely.

92
00:05:42.555 --> 00:05:45.737
Cool, I wonder if that's why stuff
was breaking in here before.

93
00:05:48.004 --> 00:05:50.068
Yeah, okay, cool.

94
00:05:50.068 --> 00:05:55.295
This works better if you
have more than one monitor.

95
00:05:55.295 --> 00:05:57.981
Let's see cuz everything's
failing me at this point.

96
00:05:57.981 --> 00:05:59.339
But let's take a look.

97
00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.958
So yeah, you can hover over and
get a sense of everything on the page and

98
00:06:03.958 --> 00:06:05.461
what the selector is.

99
00:06:05.461 --> 00:06:11.950
The other really powerful thing
that I absolutely love is,

100
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.880
and I wonder cuz I got
some weird highlight that

101
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.314
will not go away, in this case as well.

102
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.055
I don't care about that anymore, sure.

103
00:06:27.055 --> 00:06:32.644
I can do page.getByRole.

104
00:06:32.644 --> 00:06:38.006
And I can do input, Or

105
00:06:38.006 --> 00:06:40.716
even a button or something like that.

106
00:06:40.716 --> 00:06:46.687
One thing, things are being weird for me
now, was actually as I was typing earlier,

107
00:06:46.687 --> 00:06:51.074
it would highlight the thing in
the browser as I was typing it.

108
00:06:51.074 --> 00:06:54.421
So I would get the visual
feedback as well.

109
00:07:00.551 --> 00:07:02.787
Yeah, I do get my testID search.

110
00:07:07.673 --> 00:07:10.777
So let's kind of show what
this would look like, page.

111
00:07:10.777 --> 00:07:12.582
Yeah, there you can see it, right?

112
00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:17.420
I'm just typing and
it's highlighting that for

113
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.438
me based on where my cursor is in VS Code.

114
00:07:21.438 --> 00:07:26.227
If I have a matching selector,
it shows it for me in Chrome.

115
00:07:26.227 --> 00:07:31.634
And that I should not be that
amused by something that simple and

116
00:07:31.634 --> 00:07:33.276
here I am, right?

117
00:07:33.276 --> 00:07:36.706
And so I've got that.

118
00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.521
And it will show it to me.

119
00:07:38.521 --> 00:07:42.742
So that integration is super important.

120
00:07:42.742 --> 00:07:46.934
What I am trying to kind of iterate

121
00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:51.875
towards is showing how we can use this to

122
00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:56.831
get a lot of sensibility around stuff.

123
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:00.258
So just to show you real quick,
I can also like,

124
00:08:00.258 --> 00:08:03.438
if I grab this,
you can see like that works.

125
00:08:03.438 --> 00:08:06.141
And you can even see
what selector matched it,

126
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:10.176
like a partial match in this case on
the placeholder did get it for me.

127
00:08:10.176 --> 00:08:12.166
So little changes
shouldn't break your test.

128
00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.803
Like Playwright, more so
than testing library,

129
00:08:14.803 --> 00:08:19.008
is built to be somewhat resilient despite
the struggle bus that I just rode on for

130
00:08:19.008 --> 00:08:22.178
a little bit with the plugin
having an errant port running.

131
00:08:22.178 --> 00:08:26.468
But for whatever I'm running, I get that
visual feedback as I'm moving through

132
00:08:26.468 --> 00:08:29.191
the code, what I have and
stuff along those lines.

133
00:08:29.191 --> 00:08:33.201
So, for instance, we could do something
with whatever one, say, I want.

134
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:35.767
I'm gonna just kinda move this
a little bit so we can see.

135
00:08:35.767 --> 00:08:37.218
So I've got the search input.

136
00:08:37.218 --> 00:08:40.958
I can take that and I can then say, wait,

137
00:08:40.958 --> 00:08:46.914
we should do searchInput.type(),
and we'll do 'pika'.

138
00:08:46.914 --> 00:08:52.472
And we'll do page.getByRole (),

139
00:08:52.472 --> 00:08:55.951
we'll look for a link.

140
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.834
And look at the background.

141
00:08:58.834 --> 00:09:01.054
If I'm like, what was it again?

142
00:09:01.054 --> 00:09:04.705
I get all of the help.

143
00:09:04.705 --> 00:09:07.066
The problem is moving my cursor ruins it.

144
00:09:07.066 --> 00:09:12.698
You have to trust that on a bigger
monitor or two screens, it's pretty dope.

145
00:09:12.698 --> 00:09:16.602
Get role by link,
let's make that happen again.

146
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.798
Now it's gonna fail me again.

147
00:09:22.798 --> 00:09:26.823
We'll do {name: 'pikachu'}.

148
00:09:28.604 --> 00:09:31.856
Cool, and do I hit that button again and
have it fail me?

149
00:09:31.856 --> 00:09:33.325
We'll find out.

150
00:09:33.325 --> 00:09:36.196
Yeah, unclear versus a restart.

151
00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:37.739
What's gonna happen there?

152
00:09:37.739 --> 00:09:39.635
If I have to do that,
I will do it quickly so

153
00:09:39.635 --> 00:09:42.040
that we can kind of pull
this train into the station.

154
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.669
But let's see if I can kinda get
to the main point without that,

155
00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:49.929
cuz it's one of those things where
60% of the time it works every time.

156
00:09:49.929 --> 00:09:53.923
But I probably have some other errant
process on some process ID that,

157
00:09:53.923 --> 00:09:57.726
other than a restart, nobody wants
to watch me find at this point.

158
00:09:57.726 --> 00:09:59.493
But we could also run that test.

159
00:09:59.493 --> 00:10:04.894
Actually, I will get an error
if I try to run the test,

160
00:10:04.894 --> 00:10:08.264
and I want to show you that error.

161
00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:12.176
npx playwright test.

162
00:10:12.176 --> 00:10:16.402
It is gonna yell at me that something is
running on that port, and it's gonna say,

163
00:10:16.402 --> 00:10:20.815
hey, if that's cool with you and you don't
wanna make sure that we're the only thing

164
00:10:20.815 --> 00:10:24.644
on that port, you can have this setting
to reuse existing server is true.

165
00:10:24.644 --> 00:10:28.624
I use this a lot because I'm developing,
and

166
00:10:28.624 --> 00:10:33.988
that's really great for CICD,
I spin it up, I wanna run it.

167
00:10:33.988 --> 00:10:36.672
But if I have one running
just use that one.

168
00:10:36.672 --> 00:10:39.433
And so I will do that.

169
00:10:44.635 --> 00:10:48.154
We'll pop that setting in here as well.

170
00:10:48.154 --> 00:10:52.002
Cool, and
now I should be able to run my thing, and

171
00:10:52.002 --> 00:10:58.341
it will run it across all of them, and
three tests and everything is good, right?
