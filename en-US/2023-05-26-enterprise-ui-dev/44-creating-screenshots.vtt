00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.040
That said,

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.735
there are a few more things that I
would like to bring your attention to.

3
00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:10.473
In the name of how do I get as much
test coverage as I possibly can as fast

4
00:00:10.473 --> 00:00:11.470
as possible.

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.630
So let's say we have a test.

6
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.830
You know what this test is as good as any.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.600
Except for the fact that I hit record.

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.757
I hit record from the base URL.

9
00:00:24.664 --> 00:00:27.758
Let's go,
this is a little bit of a simpler test.

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.240
So we've got that in place.

11
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.703
Let's go ahead and.

12
00:00:43.692 --> 00:00:48.204
Let's grab-
&gt;&gt; Was there a weirdness with the copy

13
00:00:48.204 --> 00:00:49.600
paste in that big text?

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.970
There's no spaces between the restaurants,
not sure if that's important.

15
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.140
&gt;&gt; Where?

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.980
&gt;&gt; Line 6.
&gt;&gt; I probably need a better selector.

17
00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.900
That's probably the select box which
clearly needed a better data ID.

18
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.749
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Right so,

19
00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:04.506
because there was either no data ID.

20
00:01:04.506 --> 00:01:07.130
Or I messed up on the accessibility for
that one.

21
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.280
Again, you end up making better choices,
this is literally just grabbed an old app.

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.556
And I thought it was better.

23
00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:15.198
Because it is a two-year-old
app that I haven't looked at.

24
00:01:15.198 --> 00:01:17.020
And I can just get test coverage for it.

25
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.003
It's like using a beta
version of SvelteKit,

26
00:01:20.003 --> 00:01:23.750
which is possibly part
of my problem right now.

27
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.629
And, yes, that's probably I
need probably either a role.

28
00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:29.900
Or like at least a data ID or
something along those lines.

29
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.107
I'm guaranteeing you if
I looked at that code,

30
00:01:32.107 --> 00:01:34.601
it would fail the aXe violations
on the component test.

31
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:37.430
Because there's probably not a label,
right.

32
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.281
&gt;&gt; Going to catch those live
coding issues though, as we go.

33
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:46.036
&gt;&gt; And so yeah,
that would probably fail it as well.

34
00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:49.840
With the aXe violation, but
we can get most of the way there.

35
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.061
You know what,
let's actually say that we would like.

36
00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:59.100
Get by role combo box name is restaurant.

37
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.290
I wonder what I clicked there that got me,
let's see.

38
00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:07.723
I mean, I say that like I literally could
not run this automated test and see.

39
00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:09.835
But it's actually not that important.

40
00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:12.105
So let's go ahead we'll
say this get by roll.

41
00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:12.935
I like this.

42
00:02:12.935 --> 00:02:13.995
And we're not good.

43
00:02:13.995 --> 00:02:15.965
Yeah, we'll select an option.

44
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:20.055
I'm sure it will await that.

45
00:02:20.055 --> 00:02:22.089
Actually, I'm gonna do

46
00:02:26.382 --> 00:02:34.012
[INAUDIBLE] restaurant, Select.

47
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.339
And then what we will do is we
will go ahead and just use that.

48
00:02:44.738 --> 00:02:49.460
Sweet, and
then what happens if I run that test?

49
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.310
And I was just showing you,
mostly trying to simulate my workflow.

50
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.460
Other, also look in the VS Code one,
you will get, I didn't go to the page.

51
00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.090
This is gonna fail.

52
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.270
Don't cancel things because
things end up like.

53
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.220
This is all the playwrights
stuff is great, the VS code plug-in.

54
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.165
I'm sure people were like.

55
00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:15.987
The fact that it's unreliable is, just remember
how magic it is like we all aspire to,

56
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.668
What is the-
&gt;&gt; Are you sayinc that stopping

57
00:03:23.668 --> 00:03:27.833
tests early is bad for the extension-
&gt;&gt; It has hurt my feelings before and

58
00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:29.046
got me in a weird state.

59
00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.346
Now I didn't do that that's not
what got me the weird state earlier.

60
00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:34.120
But I have been hurt by it before.

61
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.390
&gt;&gt; Just for the extension.

62
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.670
&gt;&gt; Just for the extension, yeah.

63
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.240
Normally you can, yeah, go ahead in the command line.

64
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.010
&gt;&gt; That's what I said.

65
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.190
&gt;&gt; Command C to your heart's content.

66
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.340
Let's go ahead and let's run that again.

67
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.728
The nice part is like with the thing,

68
00:03:46.728 --> 00:03:50.210
it will usually leave my
browser in that state.

69
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.190
It seems Jack in the Box is picked.

70
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.890
Could I get this entire table?

71
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.030
Let's just grab this.

72
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.080
Let's grab this element here, right?

73
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.270
Cool and did I go paste now?

74
00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.749
Let's do the pick locator.

75
00:04:09.964 --> 00:04:11.240
Or get the entire page.

76
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.460
It was the table.

77
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.017
The table was our gross giant thing.

78
00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:26.410
Const table equals page
that I get my text.

79
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.740
Yeah, I should put a test ID on that and

80
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.580
then I would get something a lot smaller,
nicer.

81
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.250
No, we're not doing that right now.

82
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.080
This is about not refactoring
your code immediately.

83
00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.349
This is about settiny up the test
infrastructure so you can refactor.

84
00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:44.721
Let's be intellectually honest
about what we're doing.

85
00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:46.380
&gt;&gt; Cool, it's value, but never read.

86
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.631
What I would like to bring your attention
to is when it comes down to then, like.

87
00:04:51.631 --> 00:04:56.200
Getting those sanity checks,
like clicking on stuff super great.

88
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.283
But, here's an assertion
that I can make real fast,

89
00:05:00.283 --> 00:05:03.470
that'll make my life a lot easier.

90
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.889
So we'll call that table.

91
00:05:09.922 --> 00:05:13.740
And then we'll say maybe like to have,
what's that one?

92
00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.040
To have screenshot.

93
00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:22.280
And I'm going to spoil where I'm
going with this for a second.

94
00:05:25.027 --> 00:05:28.056
I don't know what the other one does.

95
00:05:31.123 --> 00:05:33.488
And let's go ahead and let's.

96
00:05:33.488 --> 00:05:38.304
I think this taken the most snapshot
test fails the first time because

97
00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:39.890
there is no snapshot.

98
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.765
And now it passess, right and

99
00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:50.329
if I look in my file system I got
this new folder with snapshots go.

100
00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:56.190
And I have a visual image of the DOM
as it was rendered in that moment.

101
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.876
Right and so that I can theoretically
not only automate a bunch of tests.

102
00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:04.560
But I can also take
a bunch of screenshots.

103
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.929
Also the to match snapshot will write
a text file of the text content.

104
00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:12.049
Or whatever of a like if
you grab if you say like.

105
00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.288
If you say h1.txt content or whatever you
can actually write that to a file and

106
00:06:17.288 --> 00:06:18.869
have a validate that as well.

107
00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:21.396
So you can click around and
do all these things.

108
00:06:21.396 --> 00:06:23.414
You can even just throw in a few like.

109
00:06:23.414 --> 00:06:27.451
Hey this text content should be what I
think or should match the screenshot.

110
00:06:27.451 --> 00:06:31.188
Obviously you can put in a file name and
separate it by what browser and

111
00:06:31.188 --> 00:06:32.938
what OS you're using, right.

112
00:06:32.938 --> 00:06:36.130
And stuff like that because
Windows has different fonts.

113
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.575
Safari makes everything shiny.

114
00:06:39.575 --> 00:06:40.990
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] space though?

115
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.830
&gt;&gt; What's it?
&gt;&gt; It must take up a bunch of space?

116
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

117
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.390
It's their images.

118
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:49.120
They put a little bit of space.

119
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.860
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right, you got to do stuff.

120
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.950
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] 100 pixels?

121
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.070
&gt;&gt; That is the test will fail.

122
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.710
If it takes another screenshot that
has more than 100 pixels difference.

123
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.974
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; And you're like, yeah,

124
00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:03.737
well kinda like map what
pixels don't match.

125
00:07:03.737 --> 00:07:07.853
And you could have a threshold
because maybe like, I don't know,

126
00:07:07.853 --> 00:07:09.409
like layouts are weird.

127
00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:13.018
You know what I mean like
stuff can change a little bit.

128
00:07:13.018 --> 00:07:17.014
You don't necessarily want your
tests to fail because of that.

129
00:07:17.014 --> 00:07:20.236
But you can set a threshold
that you want to fail.

130
00:07:20.236 --> 00:07:24.721
And like you can very quickly get
a whole bunch of test coverage really,

131
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:26.630
really, really fast.

132
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.645
Not great test coverage because cool,

133
00:07:28.645 --> 00:07:31.280
good luck figuring out why that div moved,
right?

134
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.419
But at least for a sanity check as you
start to embark on that large refactor.

135
00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:37.922
And if you're moving to
a different framework or

136
00:07:37.922 --> 00:07:40.248
you're trying to just untangle some stuff.

137
00:07:40.248 --> 00:07:43.113
Because you don't have to untangle so
you can test it.

138
00:07:43.113 --> 00:07:47.063
But like In the absence of those tests,
you don't know the breaking stuff.

139
00:07:47.063 --> 00:07:49.935
You could theoretically
automate because otherwise,

140
00:07:49.935 --> 00:07:52.080
we all know how the tests were gonna work.

141
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.660
It was gonna be you manually
doing this better than that.

142
00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:58.203
And the fact that you could
theoretically just stop.

143
00:07:58.203 --> 00:08:00.127
That you can comment out lines of code,

144
00:08:00.127 --> 00:08:02.660
the browser will be left
exactly where it was.

145
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.510
And then you can open up the developer
tools and poke around is pretty powerful.

146
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.063
But wait, there's more
