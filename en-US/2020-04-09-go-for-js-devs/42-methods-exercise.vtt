00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.700
Okay, for exercise 9A, we're gonna
practice implementing the describe group

2
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.370
or refactoring the describeGroup
function as a method.

3
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.241
So I'm gonna hop over to
exercise_9A.markdown in the methods

4
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:12.800
section.

5
00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:18.785
So the goal here is just
practice writing a method and

6
00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:21.410
refactoring an existing
function into a method.

7
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.533
And to get things going, if you look in
the code directory and methods.go, I've

8
00:00:25.533 --> 00:00:29.805
copied over the solution that we worked
through from the struct section yesterday.

9
00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:33.170
Which has all of the starting functions
for both the user struct and group.

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.600
So you can start with that code and
then build off of it.

11
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.680
You're gonna have to refactor
the scribe user code,

12
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.850
which is what we just kind of
looked at together on a slide.

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.800
And then after you're finished with the
describe user, also modify describe group

14
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.827
to be a method called describe that
receives a group struct instead.
