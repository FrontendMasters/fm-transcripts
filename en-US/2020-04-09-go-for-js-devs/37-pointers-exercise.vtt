00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.098
So the goals here are gonna be to practice
navigating between variables and pointers,

2
00:00:04.098 --> 00:00:05.886
learning how to use either the asterisk or

3
00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:09.308
the ampersand depending on what you're
trying to accomplish, and kind of just

4
00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:12.241
have a little bit more exposure to
creating and modifying structs.

5
00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:17.080
So for the directions, you're gonna
define an instance of the user struct.

6
00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.290
You can either copy and
paste the one we talked about earlier,

7
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.250
create your own,
whichever you so choose, and

8
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.220
then write a function called update email,
that's gonna take in that user type.

9
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.810
And so the user type will
have an email field on it,

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.840
in that update email field function,
update that user's email to something new.

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.290
And then lastly,
call update email from main and

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.590
verify that the updated
email has persisted.

13
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.930
So you're gonna wanna call both update
email and the original instance of that

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.548
user struct, to make sure that the email
was permanently modified in the example.

15
00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:53.420
So you'd like to copy
this code to get started.

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.974
It's just the boilerplate for

17
00:00:54.974 --> 00:00:58.269
the go template with a user struct
ready to go for you here as well.
