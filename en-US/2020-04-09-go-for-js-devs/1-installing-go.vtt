1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.550
So let's get into
the installation process.

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.410
So first of all, let's talk a little
bit about what we'll need besides

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.900
the actual Go language
throughout workshop.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.630
I'll be working mostly in a code editor.

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.170
I'll be in VS code.

6
00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.590
Option two is going to be
the Go Playground, which I'll introduce

7
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.730
you to in a later lecture.

8
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.710
And your favorite browser,
I'll be working in Chrome.

9
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.030
But if you have a different browser
you're into that's great too.

10
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.550
So as we work through the workshops,

11
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.720
there'll be exercise slides that
come up throughout the day.

12
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.790
On the upper right hand corner is going
to be where that exercise file lives

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.370
and it'll have instructions for what we're
working on, kind of the goals of that

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.010
exercise and anything I want you to keep
in mind as you're working through it.

15
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.360
For this particular exercise, we're just
going to be installing the Go language.

16
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.420
There are instructions.

17
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.530
It's a bit of a complex process if you're
not used to updating your Bash profile, so

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.850
the actual instructions live in
the exercise underscore zero dot markdown

19
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.870
file, but we'll also kind of talk
about them on the screen as well.

20
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.010
So first things first,

21
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.760
you're gonna want to go to golang
dot org slash dl to install Go.

22
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.070
And when you reach that website
you'll see a series of options

23
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.830
depending on what operating
system you're working with.

24
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.770
So once everyone has the Go Library
successfully installed through

25
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.370
the installation wizard,
our next steps are to kind of

26
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.340
coordinate what's happening on our local
machines to match that installation.

27
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.560
So the first thing we'd like to do
is verify that Go was installed and

28
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.970
to do that you'll run a couple
of commands in your terminal.

29
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.010
The first is which Go, which should
print out to where that Go installation,

30
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.300
put some of the Go executables.

31
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.910
The second command is Go version and
you should see Go 1.13 if you installed it

32
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:53.260
today, and then after that we do need to
add a couple things to our Bash profile.

33
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.830
So what we've done so
far is installed Go as a command, but

34
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.080
Go doesn't know where it
needs to access any files or

35
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.710
executables that we'll install
later on in the projects.

36
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.980
So the three environment variables you
need are up on the right hand corner,

37
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.570
you'll need to define Gopath Gobin and
then update your path to include Gobin.

38
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.110
And so those lines of code you can
add to anywhere in your Bash profile.

39
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.390
After you define your path
variable to begin with.

40
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.840
To verify that those environment
variables have successfully been updated,

41
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.730
you might need to restart your terminal.

42
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.390
But then if you run echo dollar sign path,
you should see a bunch of stuff print out

43
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.660
including somewhere in there the which
Go series of paths that you kind of

44
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.750
printed out at the beginning
the user slash local slash go.

45
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.340
And then if you run echo dollar
sign Gopath you should see

46
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.590
if it was the default download settings.

47
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.280
Your home directory in slash directory go,
so for

48
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.850
me slash users slash
Brenda Martinson slash go.

49
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.390
The kicker here is that that Go directory
hasn't actually been created yet.

50
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.590
So we need to do that next but

51
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.320
it is telling Go where it's going to
find any executable files down the road.

52
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.820
So for step four, we're going to
create the actual Go work space,

53
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.560
where we're going to put all
the files that we use today and

54
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.540
including cloning the repo for
as we work through the workshops.

55
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.460
So for looking at step four,
creating a work space

56
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.780
we'll want to navigate to whatever
our Go path was defined to be.

57
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.680
For me, that was my home directory
of users slash Brenda Martinson.

58
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.788
So I'm going to flip
over to my terminal and

59
00:03:20.788 --> 00:03:23.845
walk through the rest of the setup
to create our Go work space.

60
00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:35.131
So when I'm at my home directory,

61
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:39.190
I see that the path I'm currently living
in is users slash Brenda Martinson.

62
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.940
And right now,
when I ask what directories live here,

63
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.440
you'll see I already have a Go directory,
since I've been working in it today.

64
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.270
If you do not,
you want to make dir that Go directory and

65
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.220
this is where we're going
to put all of our Go files.

66
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.720
Once you've made that directory
we can change into it.

67
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.400
And a typical Go directory
is going to have three

68
00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.880
additional directories within it.

69
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.810
You'll have a bin, a package and
source directories.

70
00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.760
The one we care about today
is that source directory SRC.

71
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.110
That's where we're gonna put all of our
Go files and also clone in our repo.

72
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.780
So if you don't see that you're
gonna make dir the source directory.

73
00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.240
And once you've created it,
change into that.

74
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.720
And then right now you'll see I have
quite a few different projects yours will

75
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.150
probably be empty.

76
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.100
But in the source directory is where
you're gonna wanna get clone and

77
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.310
then the address to the repo.

78
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.560
So to get clone that repo you'll go to the
link on the slide and then run get clone.

79
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:45.760
Once you have that installed,
if you CD into the repo for

80
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.740
the workshop today, and
run, Go run main dot Go,

81
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.110
you should see hello Frontend Masters
print out and installation is complete
