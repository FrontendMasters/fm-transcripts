00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.150
So last thing about interfaces I want
to cover is this concept of the empty

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.440
interface.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.700
And it's written with the keyword
interface and an empty curly braces.

4
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.390
And so there are lots of times in your
code where you might not be completely

5
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.980
sure what's coming in.

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.350
You don't know if it's a user or a group.

7
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.080
You don't know what the key value
pairs on a map are, but you know,

8
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.750
you're accepting some
type of map structure.

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.760
And so
an empty interface specify zero methods.

10
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.420
It can be used to hold
a value of any type.

11
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.310
It also can be used by code
that expects an unknown type.

12
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.771
And it allows hold methods and

13
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:35.170
functions on types when you're
not totally sure what's expected.

14
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.400
So this is kind of like,
if you're working with type script or

15
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.450
other type specific
languages like the any type.

16
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.170
You're like,
I don't really know what this is, but

17
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.580
I know I need to execute this thing on it.

18
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.055
So you can use the empty interface
a little bit more freely.

19
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.010
So here's kind of an example.

20
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.530
Let's say you have three
types that are structs.

21
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.270
You've got a user, an admin, a parent,
whatever type of struct you're talking

22
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.080
about, and
you know you're gonna have a people map,

23
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.260
but you're not sure what
the types are gonna be.

24
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.510
Maybe new types will be added soon or
you're gonna modify the types,

25
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.480
you can set a variable that knows
it's a map of the key of string and

26
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.170
a value of something,
I'm not sure what, and

27
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.370
then that string key value pair
is a little bit more flexible.
