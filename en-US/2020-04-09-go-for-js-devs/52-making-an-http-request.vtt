00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.030
Let's create our people route.

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.704
So I'm gonna kill our print line in main.

3
00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:11.585
And create a http.HandleFunc("/people").

4
00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:16.851
And I'm gonna send that
getPeople function.

5
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:22.345
So we're gonna find that
next func getPeople which

6
00:00:22.345 --> 00:00:29.890
takes our favorite two arguments
are writer, HTTP response writer.

7
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.211
And I request the pointer to http.request.

8
00:00:38.892 --> 00:00:43.740
And within our function here, for now,
we'll we're going to use thumped f

9
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.680
print And that takes two things it takes
wherever we're writing our text to.

10
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.524
And what we wanna put on the page.

11
00:00:52.524 --> 00:00:54.440
So I'm gonna say, getting people.

12
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.780
If I were to run this now,
nothing's gonna happen.

13
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.670
We're missing a couple things
within our main function to

14
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.490
actually start up our server.

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.870
So the first thing I'm going to
do is just print serving on 8080.

16
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:16.030
And then Log.Fatal in case this blows up.

17
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.666
But we want, Http.ListenAndServe and

18
00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:25.978
that takes the port we're talking about,
8080, and

19
00:01:25.978 --> 00:01:30.560
any additional,
Information which we don't need for this.

20
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.060
So go ahead and save that guy.

21
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.918
Start a server, serving an AD, AD,
navigate on over to our browser.

22
00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:46.518
And we fire up the browser to
slash people you should see

23
00:01:46.518 --> 00:01:52.261
whatever you have in your
getPeople function handler.

24
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.410
Cool, so obviously, we don't just
wanna post plain text to the screen,

25
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.690
we wanna do some stuff.

26
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.840
So let's hang out in the getPeople
function for a little while.

27
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.010
And in here,

28
00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.200
the first thing we wanna do is handle the
get request to the actual API endpoint.

29
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.300
So we can use HTTP for this.

30
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.510
And we're gonna say HTTP.Get.

31
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.620
So the Get requests requires
a couple arguments.

32
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.660
The first is or sorry,
just one argument and

33
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.630
it's the URL that we want to actually hit.

34
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.360
So here we're gonna use our base URL,

35
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.420
which we have defined
as a constant line 13.

36
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.495
And I'm going to concatenate people.

37
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:36.730
So you'll notice that our base
URL ends with a forward slash and

38
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.010
concatenating slash people,
which is the endpoint that we looked at

39
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.472
at the beginning on
the Star Wars api.co website.

40
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.760
Base URL, just make sure your URL
is in all caps base capital U,

41
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.364
capital R, capital L.

42
00:02:53.364 --> 00:02:59.840
And then when this function executes,
it's going to return two things.

43
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.550
The response if everything goes well,
and an error if things don't.

44
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.756
So because it returns two things,

45
00:03:06.756 --> 00:03:08.848
we'll assign those two variables
to the left hand side.

46
00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:13.430
And the first thing we want to do
as always, is handle our error.

47
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.459
So if the error is not null,
we will handle that with http.error,

48
00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.580
which once again takes a couple things I
writer the error and says bad request.

49
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.532
I'm just gonna go ahead and print that

50
00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:36.335
failed to request Star Wars people.

51
00:03:39.662 --> 00:03:46.814
Cool, So if everything's fine,
let's go ahead and

52
00:03:46.814 --> 00:03:51.630
just print out the response and
look at what we're working with here.

53
00:03:57.064 --> 00:04:02.810
So I'm gonna kill my server and
restart it.

54
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.238
Navigate back to the browser and refresh.

55
00:04:08.238 --> 00:04:11.925
So you'll see my text is no longer there,
which is great

56
00:04:11.925 --> 00:04:16.879
because we've removed it from
the function handler, the route handler.

57
00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:20.022
And then back in the terminal,
you'll see I get a pretty big printout.

58
00:04:20.022 --> 00:04:22.522
Most importantly, we see this 200 OK.
