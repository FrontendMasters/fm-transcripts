00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.110
So now that we have Go installed and
we're seeing a Hello friend and

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.990
masters message print down in the console,
we're gonna shift gears and

3
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.380
talk a little bit about
the available documentation and

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.310
where to find information if you're
struggling with any of the Go concepts.

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.650
So if you go to golang.org,
you're gonna see this kinda landing page.

6
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.021
And the three links I'd like to
call attention to are at the top,

7
00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:23.527
you've got documents, packages, and blog.

8
00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:25.092
So I'm gonna navigate
over to my browser and

9
00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:27.390
walk through kind of what's
available there for information.

10
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.660
So we start with documents.

11
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.600
This is going to be
a really great resource for

12
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.670
that general big picture
knowledge about Go.

13
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.780
You'll see that there's
a getting started information,

14
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.866
a tour of Go which is a really
great introductory tutorial.

15
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.860
An additional kind of like
how to write Go code,

16
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.918
bigger picture documentation
around themes around Go.

17
00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:52.600
One of the greatest resources
that I think is available for

18
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.680
go is this effective go
document right here.

19
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.420
And so this gives you kind of like
the rules around style with Go.

20
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.460
How to write effective Go,
how you wanted to find variables?

21
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.770
Some of the additional information just
that isn't super intuitive from reading

22
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:07.990
other API documentation.

23
00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.410
If you go to packages, this is a giant
list of all of the standard library

24
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.050
packages that ship with Go.

25
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.740
So a lot of the ones we'll see
today are the FMT font package.

26
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.340
There's strings database,
anything that you're gonna to use to

27
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.080
write additional Go code will
live here in the packages index.

28
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.290
And then the blog on the right hand
side will be the latest releases and

29
00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.024
from the Go core team kind of anything
that's important to know in the up and

30
00:01:35.024 --> 00:01:36.280
coming in the Go language.

31
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.240
But a lot of these are gonna be where
you can find any opinions or latest

32
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.620
updates on, okay, we just released the
errors package what's new and exciting?

33
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.330
What do you need to know?

34
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.694
How do you make it backwards compatible?

35
00:01:45.694 --> 00:01:49.510
Some of that more editorial comp
information lives in the blog posts.
