00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.450
So for exercise 5A,
we're gonna practice unit testing.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.600
So far we've added a utils
package in a math.go file.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.480
And then in that file,

4
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.600
we wrote a really simple add method that
just adds a couple numbers together.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.421
So let's go look at exercise 5A .markdown
and talk about what we're gonna do for

6
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:19.357
this exercise.

7
00:00:23.843 --> 00:00:27.190
So there's a couple different parts to 5A.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.850
The first one is kinda
similar to what you'd expect.

9
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.250
We just wrote the add method
in our utils package.

10
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.880
So I'd like everyone to add
an appropriately named test file and

11
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.940
then write a test for
that particular function.

12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.520
And then run a test with run test
to make sure that it's passing.

13
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.292
Part two is going to kinda
go the opposite direction.

14
00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.600
We're gonna do some TDD or
test driven development,

15
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.720
to write a function that makes
test implementation pass.

16
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.840
So in that same utils directory, we don't

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.530
have a strings test go file yet,
but you're gonna wanna create one.

18
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.690
You'll copy the following code
that lives here into that file,

19
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.650
which is just a test for
code that doesn't exist yet.

20
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.699
And then implement the necessary
code to make that test pass.

21
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.591
So the code that lives here, you can
create a file called stringstest.go,

22
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:26.035
just in your utils directory.

23
00:01:27.573 --> 00:01:29.706
If you run the test now,
it's going to fail and

24
00:01:29.706 --> 00:01:32.131
print out something about
things don't exist yet.

25
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:35.697
And so you'll take a couple minutes
to implement the code in a presumably

26
00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:38.222
strings.go file that'll
make this test passed.
