00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.470
And the first thing we needed to do was
create a file called exercise 2a.go.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.743
So I'm going to put that in my code
directory here in my repository.

3
00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.285
Exercise 2a.go.

4
00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:18.603
And then the first thing we were asked
to do is just replicate the hello world

5
00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:20.950
example that we started
with from the beginning.

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.530
And because we're starting
with a blank slate,

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.920
this gives us an example of kind of
writing a go file from scratch once again.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.274
So we'll start with our package main.

9
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:34.964
And then, because we're working
with the filmed package,

10
00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:38.454
that's the whole point of the exercise,
I'm going to go ahead and

11
00:00:38.454 --> 00:00:41.596
import the filmed package here,
the library, excuse me.

12
00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:46.003
And then in my main file I am going
to choose thumb to print line,

13
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:50.159
so I can have that extra new line
at the end of the sentence and

14
00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.673
I am just going to type hello world.

15
00:00:52.673 --> 00:00:58.372
If I save this, open up my terminal And

16
00:00:58.372 --> 00:01:02.429
then instead of practice.go,
I'm going to say go run,

17
00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:07.520
I'm in the second directory,
code directory, exercise_2a.go.

18
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.583
So go run is going to
execute that file and

19
00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:11.840
I'll see Hello World print to the console.

20
00:01:14.453 --> 00:01:18.310
I'm gonna go ahead and comment that
guy out and work on the second one.

21
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.680
So the second example

22
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.480
that we wanted to print out is kind
of around the printf functionality.

23
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.900
And so the sentence we wanted was, hi, my
name is Brenna, I've lived in Denver for

24
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.300
4 years, they say the weather is amazing,
which is true.

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.741
So I'm actually just gonna copy this
guy so I don't have to retype it.

26
00:01:38.216 --> 00:01:42.920
And then go back to my
exercise 2a.go file.

27
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.790
So I know I want printf because I'm going
to be interpolating some variables here.

28
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.400
And then the string so
far it looks like this.

29
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.920
As I'm kind of looking at it, I'm gonna
leave it add my variables at the end,

30
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.500
and then circle back but the first one
is going to be a string of Brenna.

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.610
And I'll change this to a percent s.

32
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.140
The next is I've lived in Denver for
four years.

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.120
So we can make this percent d for
an integer and that will be four.

34
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.743
And then the third is the true or
false here,

35
00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:25.759
and so that is percent t for true.

36
00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:30.894
Save that, rerun my program, and
you see, hi, my name is Brenna,

37
00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:35.490
I've lived in Denver for four years, they
say the weather's amazing, which is true.

38
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.706
There is no new line here, but that's
okay, we could add that if we'd like.
