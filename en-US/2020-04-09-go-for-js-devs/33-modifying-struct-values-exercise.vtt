00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.570
Cool, so we're gonna kind of
hang out in the structs.go file.

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.790
We don't need to create a new one but
we're gonna hop in to exercise 6a.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.460
And so 6a is going to discuss a little bit
about how to modify values of a struct.

4
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.282
So far, we've learned how to define them,
to read the values and

5
00:00:14.282 --> 00:00:16.210
kind of interpolate them in to a function.

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.968
The next step is what we wanna do if you
wanna change any of those values in some

7
00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:20.571
capacity.

8
00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:27.130
So in 6a here,
the goal is to work with structs.

9
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.600
We're still working in
our structs.go file.

10
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.990
And let's kind of modify
our describeGroup function.

11
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.570
Right now, we're just printing
out a string, regardless.

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.360
And the space available is always
set to true based on whatever is

13
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.510
available in that particular
instance of the group.

14
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.680
But let's modify it, and
say we only want to accept new users.

15
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.540
If there are fewer than two
existing users in the group.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.411
It's a really small group.

17
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:51.340
You can only ever have two users.

18
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.410
So, if there's more than two,

19
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.300
you need to modify that space
available attribute, to be false.

20
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.324
So within the describe group function,
you're going to add some logic around,

21
00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:03.105
making an if statement,
checking that attribute, and

22
00:01:03.105 --> 00:01:06.444
then modifying it, if that number
is less than or greater than 2.

23
00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:12.664
There'll be a couple things you notice,
a couple of errors that might show up.

24
00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:15.294
And some behavior that's gonna be
a little strange, which is expected.

25
00:01:15.294 --> 00:01:17.010
And we're gonna talk about what
that means when we come back.
