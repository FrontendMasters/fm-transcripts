00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.150
Okay, and that concludes the content for
the course today.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.930
Thank you so much for
taking the time to learn about Go and

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.640
work through some of the exercises.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.671
This last slide here has
a list of resources.

5
00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:14.641
If you want to dig any deeper, there's
a lot of really great tutorials and

6
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.690
content out there, including actual
hardcopy books that I really loved.

7
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.323
And then last but not least,
feel free to get in touch with me.

8
00:00:21.323 --> 00:00:23.502
I'd love to talk more about Go or
JavaScript.

9
00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:25.504
This has been really great.

10
00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.645
Thank you so much for your time.
