00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.934
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Let's see
if you understand what I want.

2
00:00:03.934 --> 00:00:07.746
Can you see that cappuccino that they
have here at the bottom this one?

3
00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:12.940
So, I want this cappuccino,
if I click in the cappuccino, I want this

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.199
cappuccino to morph into the cappuccino
that we have here, like a nice transition.

5
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.780
So, I want that because it's the same
cappuccino image I wanted to move,

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.373
then you feel the presence of the same
element going in and out of the page.

7
00:00:30.373 --> 00:00:31.742
Can we do that?

8
00:00:31.742 --> 00:00:38.382
Yes, we can it needs a little work,
but we can, so how to do that?

9
00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:44.318
Well, what we need,
is we need this image and this image both,

10
00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:49.600
they should have the same
view transition name, okay?

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.391
The same view transition name.

12
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:53.284
Something that I didn't mention,

13
00:00:53.284 --> 00:00:56.132
is that you cannot duplicate
view transition names.

14
00:00:56.132 --> 00:01:00.494
So, I cannot use, for
example, you can say,

15
00:01:00.494 --> 00:01:05.789
just put image, like product image here,
and you're done.

16
00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:11.493
It's not gonna work because this
one shouldn't have product image,

17
00:01:11.493 --> 00:01:14.500
each image should have its own name.

18
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.461
Does that make sense?

19
00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:19.071
So I can use a product ID,
for example, on each one,

20
00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:22.526
let's see if we can
understand what we are doing.

21
00:01:22.526 --> 00:01:26.174
So, if I go to components, productItem.js,

22
00:01:26.174 --> 00:01:30.291
this one represents the every
item that you see here.

23
00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:34.832
So, it's a web component
that represents that part.

24
00:01:34.832 --> 00:01:38.876
So each product that we have here, okay?

25
00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:43.593
Inside here, we have an img declaration.

26
00:01:43.593 --> 00:01:50.066
Well, I will have some code there,
I will take the same img element and

27
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.253
I will change style.viewTransitionName.

28
00:01:54.253 --> 00:01:58.152
And the name can be, for example,

29
00:01:58.152 --> 00:02:03.808
let me go back there,
Image- and the product ID.

30
00:02:03.808 --> 00:02:11.913
So now, the image of every
element will have its own ID.

31
00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:16.674
Now I need to do the same
on the details page.

32
00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:23.669
The details page, the image on the details
page should also have the same ID.

33
00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:26.519
If not, we won't see that nice transition,

34
00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.519
the morphing transition
that I'm expecting.

35
00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.353
So I need to open now detailsPage.js, and

36
00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:38.795
there is also here an img declaration.

37
00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.676
I need to do something similar,
just copy the selector,

38
00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:44.566
even if we don't know what that is,
it doesn't matter.

39
00:02:44.566 --> 00:02:50.913
We just take the same image and
we change the style, view transition name,

40
00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:57.386
and we apply, I'm using a template string,
image-this.product.id.

41
00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:03.107
Just following the pattern that
I see on the previous lines.

42
00:03:03.107 --> 00:03:08.563
So now from an element point of view,
the idea is that

43
00:03:08.563 --> 00:03:15.136
each image has the view transition
name on both places, okay?

44
00:03:15.136 --> 00:03:16.488
Make sense?

45
00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.497
Cool, well, now,

46
00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:24.460
we need to apply some CSS styles.

47
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.262
So we need to create a new group.

48
00:03:26.262 --> 00:03:30.099
Actually, the group was created just
by defining the view transition.

49
00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:37.044
But now,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Let's

50
00:03:37.044 --> 00:03:41.809
try this as it is, and
see what happens if something happens.

51
00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:47.520
So I'm going to reload,
I'm going to click Black Americano,

52
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.114
and well, we don't see a lot here,
but it's kind of not so bad, right?

53
00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:58.880
Let's try with the cappuccino cross

54
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.490
your fingers, boom, it goes in and

55
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.266
out, which is pretty cool, right?

56
00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:11.834
Just because they have
the same view transition name.

57
00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:16.844
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Just that,
and by the way,

58
00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:19.861
they don't need to be
the same element type.

59
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:25.930
So, right now there are 2 img's,
but there is no need for that.

60
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.380
Maybe the effect will not be the same,
but you can morph any element

61
00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.849
into any other element,
they just need to have the same HTML name.

62
00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.282
And then,
you can even customize this even more.

63
00:04:43.377 --> 00:04:49.062
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: If you wanna
target this image, for example, from CSS,

64
00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:53.800
the problem is that this
image is in Shadow DOM,

65
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.954
which means I cannot change it from here.

66
00:04:57.954 --> 00:05:02.965
Again, we are not talking about Shadow DOM
and web components in this workshop.

67
00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:06.536
But the problem is that if
I wanna target that image,

68
00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:12.236
actually the way to target that image,
it's the image in a detailed space, okay?

69
00:05:12.236 --> 00:05:13.411
Something like that.

70
00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:17.134
The problem is that it's a Shadow DOM,
so from the outside,

71
00:05:17.134 --> 00:05:21.810
I cannot get into the CSS of the web
component, it's not gonna work, okay?

72
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.236
For example,
I may wanna change the width and

73
00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:29.857
add a margin, something like that.

74
00:05:29.857 --> 00:05:31.646
But it's not gonna work.

75
00:05:31.646 --> 00:05:37.668
In case you wanna work with that,
just the pattern to do that.

76
00:05:37.668 --> 00:05:43.751
Again, what's going on for
those of you without experience with this?

77
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:48.355
From the main CSS file,
I'm trying to change a CSS of that image,

78
00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:52.310
I may just say, it's simple,
that's the image.

79
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.510
So, it's the img inside detail space, but

80
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:58.982
it's not working because
it says shadow root.

81
00:05:58.982 --> 00:06:04.757
That means that this is kind of
private from a CSS point of view, so

82
00:06:04.757 --> 00:06:11.700
by default, it's not open to the outside
unless you create a Shadow DOM part.

83
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.001
I said, a what?

84
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:17.954
Shadow DOM lets you define parts.

85
00:06:17.954 --> 00:06:22.828
And a parts, is kind of a window
that you open to the outside so

86
00:06:22.828 --> 00:06:28.963
anyone can see and change, for example,
your CSS from the outside, okay?

87
00:06:28.963 --> 00:06:34.626
So, in this case,
it's inside the HTML in a template,

88
00:06:34.626 --> 00:06:42.231
we have one template per page, and
we do have a details page template here.

89
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:45.991
Here we have an img and you see that.

90
00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:50.961
Well, here we're going to add part, okay?

91
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:56.177
So you say part equals to an a name image.

92
00:06:56.177 --> 00:06:58.725
Every part has a name.

93
00:06:58.725 --> 00:07:05.907
So, this is then a window that
the Shadow DOM opens to the outer world.

94
00:07:05.907 --> 00:07:10.822
So now, from CSS,
instead of targeting the img,

95
00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:18.324
you will target a pseudo element that
says, part with the name that you set.

96
00:07:18.324 --> 00:07:24.928
You will tag,
target the part of that Shadow DOM, okay?

97
00:07:24.928 --> 00:07:29.572
This has to do with web components, it's
a design pattern around web components.

98
00:07:29.572 --> 00:07:33.727
So now if I refresh,
I need to refresh from the home,

99
00:07:33.727 --> 00:07:38.071
actually see this,
it's just getting bigger now, okay?

100
00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.044
So you see that difference?

101
00:07:40.044 --> 00:07:46.120
But I changed now that
image from the outside.

102
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.871
I think it's cool.

103
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:52.351
I remember it works also with back
buttons, not just with click,

104
00:07:52.351 --> 00:07:57.411
which is pretty cool because it's not
tied to the DOM events, actually.

105
00:07:57.411 --> 00:08:01.297
And on iPhone, it will also react to
gestures that you do on the page,

106
00:08:01.297 --> 00:08:03.376
back gestures, forward gestures.
