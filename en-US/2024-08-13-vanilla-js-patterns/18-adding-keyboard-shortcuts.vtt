00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.888
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Now you
will start seeing the advantages of

2
00:00:03.888 --> 00:00:06.156
using design patterns.

3
00:00:06.156 --> 00:00:09.461
Just for the sake of adding something,

4
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:14.169
what if I want to type something and
then use a shortcut,

5
00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.893
such as Ctrl+P, Ctrl+T,
whatever ,to hit the add.

6
00:00:18.893 --> 00:00:23.291
I mean, I can also use Enter, Return, but
just to play with something different.

7
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:26.684
Also, I can use the form
element in HTML and

8
00:00:26.684 --> 00:00:31.784
use onsubmit instead of the onclick,
that will be much better.

9
00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:36.401
But let's just stay with the idea of
adding shortcuts, keyword shortcuts.

10
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:38.701
So how to add keyword shortcuts here?

11
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:44.188
Well, I could create another file or
I can do it here in App.js.

12
00:00:44.188 --> 00:00:49.261
I'm not sure if you have ever
played with keyboard shortcuts, but

13
00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:54.528
I can just talk to the document and
add an event listener for keydown.

14
00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:55.829
So, keydown.

15
00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.288
So, keydown,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We

16
00:01:00.288 --> 00:01:01.824
receive an event.

17
00:01:01.824 --> 00:01:08.263
And we should check, for example, if the
Ctrl key is pressed, and if the key is,

18
00:01:08.263 --> 00:01:13.980
I don't know, just pick any letter,
P, T, T for to-do, whatever.

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.272
Convert P for print, no one is actually
printing these days, so, yeah,

20
00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:19.601
we can override that.

21
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:24.772
So we can prevent default, so we don't
get the print dialogue from the browser.

22
00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:29.249
And then,
how to trigger the add operation?

23
00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.225
We just need to execute the command,

24
00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:36.838
the same command as we executed
when we click the button.

25
00:01:36.838 --> 00:01:39.883
So just copy this, paste this here,

26
00:01:39.883 --> 00:01:44.023
we have to execute the command,
and that's all.

27
00:01:44.023 --> 00:01:48.912
It's because we decoupled
the execution of the action

28
00:01:48.912 --> 00:01:52.746
from the previous invoker of that action.

29
00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:56.858
So now if I execute and
I type now, dinner,

30
00:01:56.858 --> 00:02:03.385
I will not click the button,
I will press Ctrl+P, and you have it.

31
00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:07.741
So you can now easily implement
keyboard shortcuts or

32
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:10.946
gesture with your finger for the iPad.

33
00:02:10.946 --> 00:02:14.823
When you do a tick over
the screen with your finger,

34
00:02:14.823 --> 00:02:18.262
you trigger the action, whatever you want.

35
00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:20.333
Now that it's decoupled,

36
00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:25.655
it's much simpler to all other
invokers for the same command, okay?

37
00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:26.713
That makes sense?

38
00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:31.652
Now you can see that after we did
the hard work, now everything is faster,

39
00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:32.855
it's smoother.

40
00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:37.359
Every new feature we have is
actually pretty simple to implement.
