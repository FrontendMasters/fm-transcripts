WEBVTT

00:00:00.237 --> 00:00:01.729
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: As
we mentioned before,

2
00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:07.470
it's many of these design patterns, it's
actually better to see them in action.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.376
So for that, we are going to use
another project, not our Todo Master.

4
00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:13.870
It's going to be Coffee Masters.

5
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.450
There is a single page application for
a coffee store, where you can go and

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.086
pre-order your coffee, okay?

7
00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.914
It's like the Starbucks application,
it's a mini Starbucks application.

8
00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:26.269
And there,
the project is already there, okay?

9
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.219
So, some design patterns
are already implemented there,

10
00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:35.024
such as web components,
it's kind of a design pattern as well.

11
00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:38.574
Actually, I'm not sure if you know this,
but

12
00:00:38.574 --> 00:00:42.505
there is no W3C spec with
the name Web Components.

13
00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:47.238
So actually, Web Components is a mix of,
it's actually a design pattern.

14
00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:54.059
It's the idea of mixing several APIs,
HTML templates, shadow DOM,

15
00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.240
and the ability to create your own HTML
tags with the Custom Elements API.

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.572
So the usage of the three at the same time
is what we know as the Web Component.

17
00:01:06.572 --> 00:01:09.301
And that's actually
another design pattern.

18
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:14.347
If you wanna know more about that and
you don't have experience with that design

19
00:01:14.347 --> 00:01:18.942
pattern, Web Components, you can
check my course at Fronted Masters,

20
00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:22.428
Vanilla JavaScript,
you might not need a framework.

21
00:01:22.428 --> 00:01:25.001
Where we are going in that course,

22
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:30.159
we create from scratch the project
that we will use right now, okay?

23
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.600
Today, we're going to take that project,
the output from that workshop,

24
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.694
and we will implement new
design patterns on top of that.

25
00:01:39.694 --> 00:01:45.353
Such as lazy load, View transitions for
single-page applications,

26
00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:48.665
HTML templates, and routing metadata.

27
00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:52.039
So let's jump directly into that.

28
00:01:56.168 --> 00:02:00.924
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So now I will
open the folder, Coffee Masters initial.

29
00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:09.246
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: It's also
a Vanilla JS project, so no dependencies,

30
00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.644
no NPM install, no nothing.

31
00:02:11.644 --> 00:02:15.265
You can see it's more complex,
so we have components,

32
00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:19.437
these are web components with
a lot of code already there, CSS.

33
00:02:19.437 --> 00:02:25.394
We have data, some services, API,
menu, so there is a lot of code there.

34
00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:27.289
So let's first analyze the project.

35
00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.544
So I'm going to open this in a web server.

36
00:02:29.544 --> 00:02:30.641
Any web server will work.

37
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:35.825
Localhost, I'm going to
use npx serve again,

38
00:02:35.825 --> 00:02:39.752
but any other thing will work.

39
00:02:39.752 --> 00:02:41.726
And this is how it looks like.

40
00:02:41.726 --> 00:02:44.162
We can also decrease a little bit.

41
00:02:45.522 --> 00:02:50.732
This is mobile-optimized,
so it looks better

42
00:02:50.732 --> 00:02:55.692
when you turn on this mode,
the mobile mode.

43
00:02:55.692 --> 00:02:58.732
But we see a menu, okay?

44
00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:03.180
And If I click Americano,
it gets into the details.

45
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.308
I can add to the cart, and
when you add things to the cart,

46
00:03:07.308 --> 00:03:10.063
you can see here we have a badge there.

47
00:03:10.063 --> 00:03:14.394
Let me increase a little bit,
there, that's better.

48
00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:18.944
And I can go to the cart and
see the current contents.

49
00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:20.001
I can delete.

50
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.689
It's just that, okay?

51
00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.050
It's using Web Components,
it's using client-side routing.

52
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.337
So if you look at the URL here at the top,
when you get into the details,

53
00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:31.739
it goes to a different URL.

54
00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.434
When you go to the order,
it's also changing the URL, /order.

55
00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:41.730
But actually, there is no order HTML or
document in the server,

56
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.931
this is just client-side routing
without libraries, okay?

57
00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:49.618
So that's the project.

58
00:03:49.618 --> 00:03:52.631
So we're going to start
adding things there.
