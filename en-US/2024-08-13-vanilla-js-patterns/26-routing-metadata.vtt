00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.912
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: One more pattern
that we can add that is actually pretty

2
00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.505
simple into this single-page
application before getting into

3
00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:11.496
a multi-page application is metadata.

4
00:00:11.496 --> 00:00:14.184
So, look at this.

5
00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:17.763
If you look here,
it always says Coffee Masters.

6
00:00:17.763 --> 00:00:21.419
No matter where I am, it says Coffee
Masters, Coffee Masters, Coffee Masters.

7
00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.593
Wait, I mean, it's not bad but
by the way, this is actually a PWA.

8
00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:31.936
So I can open this as an app.

9
00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:35.595
Let me,
in case you haven't seen this before,

10
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:39.074
let me uninstall the app,
and do that again.

11
00:00:39.074 --> 00:00:43.958
So, you can see I have this little
button here that says install.

12
00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:48.489
I can install Coffee Masters,
it's also in the menu.

13
00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.732
Now it's in save and share,
install Coffee Masters,

14
00:00:52.732 --> 00:00:57.438
when you install Coffee Masters,
now you have a full desktop

15
00:00:57.438 --> 00:01:02.346
application in your Mac,
in Windows, in Linux, in Android.

16
00:01:02.346 --> 00:01:06.930
So if I open Coffee Masters,
I have a full app.

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.251
So this is an app, okay, that is running
my application but in some Window, okay?

18
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:19.164
With its own icon, it appears in Alt tab,
it works on iOS, iPadOS, Windows,

19
00:01:19.164 --> 00:01:21.925
Mac, Safari, blah, blah, blah, blah.

20
00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:26.498
And again, when I'm getting into details,
you can see I also have two titles,

21
00:01:26.498 --> 00:01:28.897
it doesn't make too much sense, right?

22
00:01:28.897 --> 00:01:33.825
So, there are ways in PWAs to
remove the title blah, blah,

23
00:01:33.825 --> 00:01:38.753
blah, but at least,
I could try to reuse the name there or,

24
00:01:38.753 --> 00:01:41.808
say, that I'm in the order, like,

25
00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:46.765
I'm trying to make use of
title bar with some okay?

26
00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:51.959
So, that's the pattern of
updating the metadata per route.

27
00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.738
So, to do that,
we will go back to the router and

28
00:01:55.738 --> 00:01:58.961
I'm actually going to add a new method.

29
00:01:58.961 --> 00:02:06.344
So, the router is this one, has in it go
well here, I will add a set metadata.

30
00:02:06.344 --> 00:02:11.044
You can change a lot of stuff,
I'm going to change the,

31
00:02:11.044 --> 00:02:15.544
we can tell you the title or
the section, and a color,

32
00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:18.444
you will see why color in a second.

33
00:02:18.444 --> 00:02:24.618
The title, it's an API,
that's one of the oldest API in the web.

34
00:02:24.618 --> 00:02:28.362
It's document.title.

35
00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:32.298
It's one of the oldest API,
I remember using this in the 90s.

36
00:02:32.298 --> 00:02:37.252
They were fancy websites, they were
animating the title that you were seeing.

37
00:02:37.252 --> 00:02:39.769
It was, wow, the title was animated.

38
00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.082
But anyway, [LAUGH] we are not
going to animate the title.

39
00:02:43.082 --> 00:02:49.207
We are going to just apply a string here,
an interpolation with the title you send,

40
00:02:49.207 --> 00:02:54.209
and maybe Coffee Masters as a suffix,
or whatever you want, okay?

41
00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.364
And then, what about the color?

42
00:02:56.364 --> 00:03:01.565
I'm not sure if you know that now,
every web app has a theme color, okay?

43
00:03:01.565 --> 00:03:06.003
In fact, if it's a PWA,
the theme color is actually this brown,

44
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.601
you can see the brown in the title bar?

45
00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:10.087
It's actually there.

46
00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:14.627
So, that theme color can
be defined in a web app

47
00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:18.826
manifest that's a JSON, or in a meta tag.

48
00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:21.546
The meta tag goes in the HTML.

49
00:03:21.546 --> 00:03:23.626
Do we have a meta tag for that?

50
00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:28.910
I don't think so, but
we can add one, it's meta name,

51
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.190
theme color, with a content, with a color.

52
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.167
We can leave it empty for now.

53
00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:41.366
But I want the HTML element so I can
dynamically change it with JavaScript.

54
00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:43.264
If you have never played with this,

55
00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:46.823
you will understand what it is in
a second when you see it finished.

56
00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:51.787
So, because it's a meta tag,
you can, it's actually the DOM.

57
00:03:51.787 --> 00:03:58.640
You can use the DOM to change it, and
you can change it really quickly, how?

58
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.173
Well, you just say,
document query selector.

59
00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:07.600
And we can look for
a meta with the name, theme,

60
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.044
color, we use attribute selector.

61
00:04:11.044 --> 00:04:16.212
And we change the content with
the color that someone is setting here.

62
00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:17.232
What's the goal here?

63
00:04:17.232 --> 00:04:22.523
Each route can define its own
title that is Its own color.

64
00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:23.628
Does that make sense?

65
00:04:26.018 --> 00:04:29.567
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So now, here we
have a switch and based on the route we

66
00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:34.423
are saying, we go to the menu,
we go to the order, we go to the details.

67
00:04:34.423 --> 00:04:39.402
Well, we can call router.setmetadata.

68
00:04:39.402 --> 00:04:43.779
So, let's call this is the menu,
and let's put a color here.

69
00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:48.663
Let's say that the menu will
use that brown that we have

70
00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:51.848
there that from a CSS point of view,

71
00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:57.920
it's defined here in this manifest
file is this one, theme color.

72
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.841
Any CSS color will work.

73
00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:04.336
So for the order page,
just for testing, right?

74
00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:08.307
I mean, we can say,
it's not going to look nice, but

75
00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:13.096
we can say this is gonna be green,
it will probably be terrible.

76
00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:16.618
And for the details, I can use the name,

77
00:05:16.618 --> 00:05:20.969
the title of the product
you are getting in later,

78
00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.435
we can use blue, just for
trying something quick.

79
00:05:25.435 --> 00:05:31.645
So, let's see first in Chrome, so
I'm going to open this again, Corel 3000,

80
00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:37.950
and by the way, it's not working, so
something, we broke something, let's see.

81
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.614
Cannot say properties of null,
set metadata, 19, let's see.

82
00:05:44.614 --> 00:05:50.938
19, meta name theme color.

83
00:05:50.938 --> 00:05:55.423
Because I didn't save my HTML,
you can see that dot there.

84
00:05:55.423 --> 00:05:58.820
So I didn't save it so
we don't have the theme color meta type.

85
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.429
Was undefined, that's really wide.

86
00:06:02.429 --> 00:06:03.988
Yeah, there we are, we are back.

87
00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:08.664
So, if you look at the menu now,
it says, I'm sorry, in the title bar,

88
00:06:08.664 --> 00:06:09.754
it says, menu.

89
00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:15.075
If I'm getting here, it says, details,
if I'm going to the order, it says, order.

90
00:06:15.075 --> 00:06:18.382
Do I see any color change?

91
00:06:18.382 --> 00:06:24.141
Not really, because Chrome in
browser mode is not really using it.

92
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:27.365
But let me jump into Safari.

93
00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:32.615
Safari is actually using
the color,let's say where.

94
00:06:32.615 --> 00:06:37.095
But let's see if I'm getting into
the details, look at the title bar,

95
00:06:37.095 --> 00:06:38.431
[LAUGH] now it's blue.

96
00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:41.739
Yeah, awful, I know,
I'm a developer, right?

97
00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:45.096
So if I'm going to order, now it's green.

98
00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:48.652
So Safari is using the theme color there.

99
00:06:48.652 --> 00:06:53.440
And now if I open the PWA again,
and I reload,

100
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:57.348
let me go back and try to reload this.

101
00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:03.631
Now, Chrome in PWA mode is
changing the title bar directly.

102
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.214
Yeah, I'm not saying it looks good here,
but

103
00:07:06.214 --> 00:07:09.536
I'm just showing you a way that
you have to customize that.

104
00:07:09.536 --> 00:07:13.348
So you can customize that per route,
and also,

105
00:07:13.348 --> 00:07:16.984
we can see the change in
the title bar as well.

106
00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:22.573
And now, you see that by default,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Chrome,

107
00:07:22.573 --> 00:07:25.100
this is for avoiding phishing.

108
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.085
It's adding the name of your app always,
even if you don't want to.

109
00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:33.274
So maybe that's, why phishing?

110
00:07:33.274 --> 00:07:35.864
Because then you say, I'm Bank of America.

111
00:07:35.864 --> 00:07:39.296
So you change the title and say, no, no,
this is not the Bank of America app.

112
00:07:39.296 --> 00:07:43.038
Actually, when you install the app,
it was called blah blah,

113
00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:48.066
Bank of America dash the name of the real
app, that's to avoid phishing apps on PWA.

114
00:07:48.066 --> 00:07:51.758
So maybe, you we can go and
say, no, you know what?

115
00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:55.617
Maybe I don't wanna add when we were
setting the metadata that suffix,

116
00:07:55.617 --> 00:07:57.299
because we already have that.

117
00:07:57.299 --> 00:08:02.278
Or we can do that only if it's a PWA,
it's possible to do something like that.

118
00:08:02.278 --> 00:08:06.072
So, then I can just, no,

119
00:08:06.072 --> 00:08:10.389
I don't wanna inspect this.

120
00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:11.652
Reload, there we are.

121
00:08:11.652 --> 00:08:15.064
So now it says Coffee Master menu,
Coffee Master order.

122
00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:17.798
We have the ninth animations, okay?

123
00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:24.264
Everything is in place now and
it's working as kind of a native app.

124
00:08:24.264 --> 00:08:29.262
And if you wanna learn more about how
to create these installable web apps,

125
00:08:29.262 --> 00:08:33.802
check my other course, PWA,
available also on front end masters.
