00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.057
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: You should know,
for doing this workshop,

2
00:00:02.057 --> 00:00:03.902
something about Vanilla JavaScript.

3
00:00:03.902 --> 00:00:08.832
But just in case, the idea of Vanilla
JavaScript is the usage of the core

4
00:00:08.832 --> 00:00:14.258
language and browser APIs to create web
apps without any additional library or

5
00:00:14.258 --> 00:00:16.086
framework on top, okay?

6
00:00:16.086 --> 00:00:21.897
Sometimes then we can extend this
definition and some people add the idea.

7
00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:25.287
Yeah, you can use microframeworks or
microlibraries, which is okay.

8
00:00:25.287 --> 00:00:29.729
But it's mainly saying that we're creating
a web app that is not React-based,

9
00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.923
it's not Angular-based, not Vue-based,
not Next.js-based, etc.

10
00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:36.861
Okay, now, that's the idea, right?

11
00:00:36.861 --> 00:00:42.799
So we will just using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript, that's all.

12
00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:47.077
And if you don't have enough experience
with Vanilla JavaScript, I recommend you

13
00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:51.491
the Vanilla JavaScript: You Might Not Need
a Framework course at Frontend Masters.

14
00:00:51.491 --> 00:00:54.488
That will give you the insights of that.

15
00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:58.384
In fact, one of the projects
that we will be using today and

16
00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:03.011
applying some design patterns to it
is the outcome of that workshop.

17
00:01:03.011 --> 00:01:05.869
So if you wanna see how to create
that workshop from scratch,

18
00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.223
you can follow that course.

19
00:01:09.428 --> 00:01:13.195
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: So for
Vanilla JavaScript web apps,

20
00:01:13.195 --> 00:01:17.212
we can apply classic design patterns.

21
00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:22.183
Where are those classic, typically
designed patterns, coming from that book,

22
00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:23.559
from the Gang of Four?

23
00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:27.433
We can still take that book and
we are not going to cover or

24
00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:33.130
talk about the 23 design patterns that
are there cuz it doesn't make any sense.

25
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.768
But we can take some of those.

26
00:01:35.768 --> 00:01:40.304
For example, I mentioned so
far singleton, factory.

27
00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:44.614
Those two design patterns
are coming from that book, okay,

28
00:01:44.614 --> 00:01:47.413
from the Gang of Four Design Patterns.

29
00:01:47.413 --> 00:01:51.899
Then we can start thinking about
solving problems that are web-specific.

30
00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.889
Of course, every platform,

31
00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.914
every software development platform
has its own list of design patterns.

32
00:01:58.914 --> 00:02:03.759
It's not the same to create the the web
app, that you create a VR game, or

33
00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.653
if you're creating an Android application,
of course,

34
00:02:07.653 --> 00:02:10.444
the problems that we have are different.

35
00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:14.662
So that's why on every category
of app that you're creating,

36
00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:20.006
you will find also a list of design
patterns for that specific platform, okay?

37
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:25.634
So we will talk about specific design
patterns that we can apply on the web

38
00:02:25.634 --> 00:02:31.371
that are not useful on a desktop
application, on a backend application.

39
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.113
We will then get into the umbrella,
let's say,

40
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:40.409
of single page applications,
multi page applications as well, and

41
00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.253
data and state management as categories
of design patterns that we can use or

42
00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:49.931
we can apply when we
are talking about web apps.

43
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:51.367
So as I mentioned before,

44
00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:54.711
we are not going to cover all
the design patterns available.

45
00:02:54.711 --> 00:03:00.324
First, because there is
no finite list anywhere.

46
00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:04.434
So there is no list of, these are all
the design patterns available.

47
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:09.888
We can take that book and say, okay,
those are the initial 23 design patterns,

48
00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:12.826
okay, but there are more design patterns.

49
00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:18.507
And every day,
a new design pattern is born.

50
00:03:18.507 --> 00:03:22.504
And also, we may take a month, actually,

51
00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:26.958
to cover most of the design
patterns out there.

52
00:03:26.958 --> 00:03:29.970
The whole idea is for
you to understand the most important ones.

53
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.501
And then you will be ready to go and
find design pattern somewhere and

54
00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:40.322
try to understand, okay, I understand the
idea, just try to implement this as well.
