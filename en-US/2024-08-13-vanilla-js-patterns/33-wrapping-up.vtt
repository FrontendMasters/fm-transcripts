00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.335
We are reaching the end of the workshops,

2
00:00:03.335 --> 00:00:07.442
this practical web app
design patterns workshop.

3
00:00:07.442 --> 00:00:10.021
So, let's make a quick recap.

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:13.032
So, we talked about what
the design pattern is.

5
00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:15.922
Remember, it's just a recipe,

6
00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:20.886
it's a way to have a common
vocabulary in the community.

7
00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:23.611
So now you know that if I say,
I will implement a singleton,

8
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:25.089
you know what I'm talking about.

9
00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.596
If I'm using a lazy load, you know what
I'm talking about, it's just that.

10
00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:34.791
Remember that it has a problem
that it's trying to solve.

11
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:40.284
We talk for a solution, and we need
to use them only if this is actually

12
00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:46.272
my problem or our problem, and
it's our context, so the solution works.

13
00:00:46.272 --> 00:00:51.671
We cover classic design patterns in
JavaScript with the to-do masters okay?

14
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:54.661
We implemented several
classic design patterns,

15
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:58.274
software design patterns there
to understand why is really,

16
00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:02.597
and remember, we have larger overhead,
so over complexity initially.

17
00:01:02.597 --> 00:01:07.336
But then, after it's done,
we realize that we have a real

18
00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:12.393
good outcome of that,
that we can start adding more actions.

19
00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:16.274
It was actually very simple
to implement the undo.

20
00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:19.926
So, we had a lot of work initially,
applying and

21
00:01:19.926 --> 00:01:24.038
not seeing anything,
just applying abstract ideas.

22
00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:29.925
But then when it's implemented,
it's much better to maintain and scale.

23
00:01:29.925 --> 00:01:35.343
We've seen patterns for single page
applications using coffee masters,

24
00:01:35.343 --> 00:01:40.417
okay, build transitions,
we've covered how to change metadata for

25
00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.921
the route in lazy load and others.

26
00:01:42.921 --> 00:01:45.589
Multipage applications, prefetch,

27
00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:50.204
also how to do view transitions
between different HTML documents.

28
00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:54.416
We've covered briefly some ideas,
some patterns on data and

29
00:01:54.416 --> 00:01:57.748
state management,
as well as some other ideas.

30
00:01:57.748 --> 00:01:59.690
That's all I have for you today.

31
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.297
Thank you.
