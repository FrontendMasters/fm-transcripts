00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.820
So are you ready for some Collab?

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.956
So, actually, it's a very simple to do
app created with vanilla JavaScript,

3
00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:11.190
and the code works, but
it has several problems.

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.160
I mean, it works, that's fine.

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.680
But we can see the problems when
we are trying to do some things.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.648
So, for example, what if we want
to save the list todos locally?

7
00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:26.358
Remember, those questions, we will go
back to those questions in a second.

8
00:00:26.358 --> 00:00:31.058
If I wanna add keyboard shortcuts, if I
wanna make it more complex in the future.

9
00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:34.078
And because it's not
using any design pattern,

10
00:00:34.078 --> 00:00:38.803
we will need to decouple most of
the behavior using design patterns, okay?

11
00:00:38.803 --> 00:00:43.199
Or for example to create an undo action,
it's actually pretty cool.

12
00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:49.173
So the lab is available there,
remember feedback,

13
00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:54.481
firtman.github.io/webapp-patterns.

14
00:00:55.541 --> 00:01:00.210
When you get there,
you will see step by step instructions.

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.825
We will start, actually,
with chapter 2 now, classic patterns,

16
00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:06.424
checking the project.

17
00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:11.552
And before you need to download or
fork the repo.

18
00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:15.660
So actually, when you go to
the introduction, you have a link for

19
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.460
the repo, so you can download the repo,
fork the repo, whatever you want.

20
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.737
I'm going to open now
that repo in my VS Code,

21
00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:29.388
and this is what you're going to find.

22
00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:33.279
We have three projects,
one of them is TodoMasters and

23
00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:37.120
there are two folders, initial and final.

24
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.009
We're going to start with initial
the final is the final code that we

25
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.111
will be creating.

26
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:48.813
I will be doing most of the code directly
wide explaining what I'm doing, okay?

27
00:01:48.813 --> 00:01:54.492
But if you wanna follow along, also,
you can go to the companion website and

28
00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:58.183
go chapter by chapter, lesson by lesson.

29
00:01:58.183 --> 00:02:03.147
So when you get there, I'm going to follow
this pattern so we're going to do this

30
00:02:03.147 --> 00:02:07.764
first, upgrading app.js, then we're
going to do this and that, okay?

31
00:02:07.764 --> 00:02:12.570
So you can follow along you don't need to
copy what I'm typing you can get it from

32
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.667
here if you want.

33
00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.320
And also you have the final version,

34
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.027
it's gonna be probably 90% the same
as the one that I will get,

35
00:02:21.027 --> 00:02:25.819
because I will be doing live coding,
and based on your questions,

36
00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.914
I will probably slightly change the final
code, but it's gonna be pretty similar.

37
00:02:31.914 --> 00:02:36.510
So, that means that you can go and
open directly TodoMasters &gt;

38
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.553
Initial as your current folder project,
and that's gonna be good.

39
00:02:41.553 --> 00:02:48.353
So I can go and
open the folder TodoMaster initial.

40
00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:50.973
So I'm going to be working here.

41
00:02:50.973 --> 00:02:55.177
So you can see I only have three files,
index.html,

42
00:02:55.177 --> 00:02:58.075
that it's actually pretty simple,

43
00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:03.494
it actually fits in one screen,
even with a large font size, okay?

44
00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:06.954
It only includes an app.js file and
a CSS file.

45
00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:13.172
It has a div, a container with a title,
an input type, a button that says Add,

46
00:03:13.172 --> 00:03:18.824
and a todo-list, that's all I have,
okay, pretty simple.

47
00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:22.826
Then CSS, well, we're not going to
cover CSS, but it's also pretty simple,

48
00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:24.597
nothing to worry about.

49
00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:27.877
And app.js, it's also pretty simple.

50
00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:33.352
So I'm DOM content loaded and
actually creating references for the three

51
00:03:33.352 --> 00:03:39.950
elements that I will need later, the
input, the button and the UL and the list.

52
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.430
When you click on the button,
I'm getting the value from the input.

53
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.108
If it's not empty string,
I'm creating a new li, a new item,

54
00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:54.698
setting a class name,
setting its content, with the text and

55
00:03:54.698 --> 00:03:58.780
then a Delete button, and
appending that into the UI.

56
00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:05.543
And then I have another event listener for
delete, so very simple.

57
00:04:05.543 --> 00:04:08.623
That actually I mean, it works, let's see.

58
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.643
So, I should open this, actually,

59
00:04:10.643 --> 00:04:13.903
I can open this directly with
the file protocol because I'm

60
00:04:13.903 --> 00:04:18.153
not using any external reference, but
let's let's run this in local host.

61
00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:23.989
So, I can use any server,
I have here a plugin for VS Code.

62
00:04:23.989 --> 00:04:31.123
You probably know how to run a server,
if not, I'm going to use npx serve.

63
00:04:31.123 --> 00:04:34.668
This is using node.js to download and

64
00:04:34.668 --> 00:04:40.993
execute the serve library that
we just open localhost, 3000.

65
00:04:40.993 --> 00:04:46.539
You can Ctrl-click or
Cmd-click, and this is the app.

66
00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.059
So it's a very simple app.

67
00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:54.329
So here we can apply design patterns,
and it's adding this here, okay?

68
00:04:54.329 --> 00:05:01.051
Then we will get some lunch, and then
I can delete that, and it works, okay?
