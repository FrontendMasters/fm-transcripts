1
00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:06.053
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: The last lab that
I have for you today is Cooking Masters.

2
00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:11.796
Cooking Masters is a multi-page
application for a recipe website, okay?

3
00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:13.801
And we were going to
implement new patterns.

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:18.451
We are going to do two,
the ones that we can do in short time.

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:23.750
View Transitions for For
multi page applications and pre fetch.

6
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.133
So let's apply both, Okay?

7
00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:30.079
So for that, let's go

8
00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.055
back to our BS code,
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: And

9
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:42.214
I'm going to open
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Cooking

10
00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:44.032
Master's Initial.

11
00:00:44.032 --> 00:00:48.022
Remember, you also have a final
version for everything here.

12
00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:51.729
And now I'm going to open a browser.

13
00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.189
By the way, there is no JavaScript here.

14
00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:57.099
No JS file.

15
00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:59.572
Just HTML, css.

16
00:00:59.572 --> 00:01:02.168
No JavaScript, okay.

17
00:01:02.168 --> 00:01:06.383
So when I can use this other MPX,
herb or this other browser,

18
00:01:06.383 --> 00:01:10.197
this is how it looks like,
okay, Cooking Master's.

19
00:01:10.197 --> 00:01:14.566
So I have recipes, Fish Tacos,
Vegetarian, of course,

20
00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:20.912
we have some Argentinian Asado, that's
like a barbecue that we have in Argentina.

21
00:01:20.912 --> 00:01:24.940
Also do select the brownies is
also an Argentinian recipe.

22
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.917
But it's a Calamari, you get it.

23
00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.053
It's another HTML.

24
00:01:28.053 --> 00:01:31.348
Calamari HTML,
we have the recipe, that's all.

25
00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:32.633
So pretty simple.

26
00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:37.582
But yeah, every time I'm getting into
this, you can feel, even if it's local,

27
00:01:37.582 --> 00:01:41.763
it's really fast, but you can feel
we are kind of changing the page.

28
00:01:41.763 --> 00:01:45.477
Okay, so, it doesn't look like an app.

29
00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:48.522
It look like a,
it looks like a website from the 90s,

30
00:01:48.522 --> 00:01:51.849
where you click on a link and
it goes somewhere else, okay?

31
00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.514
So, yeah, it doesn't look so nice.

32
00:01:54.514 --> 00:02:00.823
So we are going to start enabling page
view transitions for cross documents.

33
00:02:00.823 --> 00:02:03.593
That's the name of the API for this.

34
00:02:03.593 --> 00:02:08.590
It works on Chrome 126,
if you wanna see the version of

35
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.855
your Chrome or by the way,
if you have also edge,

36
00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:18.291
you can also use about here I
think it works on Chrome and Edge.

37
00:02:18.291 --> 00:02:22.428
At, at, at the time of shooting this
video, the stable version 125 so

38
00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:24.112
it's not going to work here.

39
00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:27.179
So I'm going to open Chrome Canary.

40
00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.342
If you have the bettee version,
it should work as well.

41
00:02:30.342 --> 00:02:35.722
So canary is 127 in my case,
so it will work here, okay.

42
00:02:35.722 --> 00:02:38.960
But probably when you're watching
this video, it works on your Chrome,

43
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.433
directly in your stable Chrome.

44
00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:46.220
So from here, then,
I'm going to open Cooking Master's.

45
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.279
Okay, so I'm going to use this browser,
just to see this in action.

46
00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:55.222
How to enable page view transitions for
cross documents.

47
00:02:55.222 --> 00:02:59.776
So there is a big difference
with the previous version.

48
00:02:59.776 --> 00:03:02.802
We don't need to use JavaScript.

49
00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:03.908
Right?
Because,

50
00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:08.785
It makes sense because when you click
on a link and you're getting out,

51
00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:13.908
you are not trapping that with transcript
because while on before unload,

52
00:03:13.908 --> 00:03:19.109
on unload, the lifecycle of the page
that is getting out of the navigation,

53
00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.336
it's not good enough for
you to start working with, anyway,

54
00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:28.658
there are new events that you can find
if you want to customize the animation.

55
00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:31.400
It's about CSS, at least the basic part.

56
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.342
So if you open right now, all the HTMLs
are pointing to the same css,

57
00:03:36.342 --> 00:03:37.658
so that's good.

58
00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:42.894
Then they're all pointing to the same css,
styles.css.

59
00:03:42.894 --> 00:03:49.722
So, if you open styles.css, we are going
to start adding a new css property.

60
00:03:49.722 --> 00:03:56.764
It's add-view-transition and
here we can say navigation-auto.

61
00:03:59.284 --> 00:04:02.002
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: We
are enabling with this.

62
00:04:02.002 --> 00:04:05.910
View page transitions between navigations.

63
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:12.883
In this case, both the initial page and
the destination page,

64
00:04:12.883 --> 00:04:17.761
they both have to have navigation enabled.

65
00:04:17.761 --> 00:04:22.576
So they both need that css, both pages.

66
00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:23.084
Okay?

67
00:04:23.084 --> 00:04:24.544
Make sense?

68
00:04:24.544 --> 00:04:26.444
And by the way, this,

69
00:04:26.444 --> 00:04:32.244
what you're going to see here works
only on pages on the same origin,

70
00:04:32.244 --> 00:04:37.244
so there should be two HTML
documents from the same origin.

71
00:04:37.244 --> 00:04:39.915
Do you all know what an origin is?

72
00:04:39.915 --> 00:04:45.248
Protocol plus host plus port,
so typically the domain.

73
00:04:45.248 --> 00:04:49.193
So I cannot do a view transition
from my website to google.com,

74
00:04:49.193 --> 00:04:50.589
it's not gonna work.

75
00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:54.498
Even if google.com is also adding
that css, it's not gonna work, okay?

76
00:04:54.498 --> 00:05:00.260
It's only for different HTML
patients from the same domain.

77
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:07.326
So if I try now, if I click,
I'm not sure if you see the difference.

78
00:05:07.326 --> 00:05:12.429
But now, I mean it's difficult
to feel the difference,

79
00:05:12.429 --> 00:05:15.206
but now there is a transition.

80
00:05:19.062 --> 00:05:21.767
&gt;&gt; Maximiliano Firtman: Again,
it's not simple to see that, but

81
00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:26.484
there is a transition now, a transition
that then you can customize with

82
00:05:26.484 --> 00:05:29.984
the same properties that we saw for
single patients.

83
00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:35.507
So now it doesn't feel like, by the way,
the first time you get in there.

84
00:05:35.507 --> 00:05:41.932
I think it's going
recognizing it pretty good.

85
00:05:41.932 --> 00:05:44.526
So.
So it's a cross phase by default,

86
00:05:44.526 --> 00:05:46.026
the same as before.

87
00:05:46.026 --> 00:05:50.403
But can we use the same technique
to take this image, for

88
00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:54.704
example, and
morph this image into this other image?

89
00:05:54.704 --> 00:05:57.236
I think that will be really cool.

90
00:05:57.236 --> 00:05:58.854
Does it make sense?

91
00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:05.508
So yeah, we can do that, even if they
are part of completely separate documents.

92
00:06:05.508 --> 00:06:12.161
The only thing is that they have to
have the same build transition name.

93
00:06:12.161 --> 00:06:17.865
So for example,
let's go to Fish Tacos HTML.

94
00:06:17.865 --> 00:06:19.835
Fish Tacos HTML.

95
00:06:19.835 --> 00:06:22.632
Again, this has no JavaScript HTML.

96
00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.169
And I will take just one part,
here I have the image.

97
00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.968
I can take the image or I can take
the whole div, it's up to me, but

98
00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:31.728
let's take the image.

99
00:06:31.728 --> 00:06:38.554
And I will set, I will use,
let's open the index as well.

100
00:06:38.554 --> 00:06:42.628
Index styles, but of course I can
use an external style as well.

101
00:06:42.628 --> 00:06:50.443
I can say the view transition
name to be Fish Tacos.

102
00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:52.200
So what's the point with that?

103
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.018
This is the target page.

104
00:06:54.018 --> 00:06:58.718
If the origin page has one element and
only one element, if you have two,

105
00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:00.195
it's not gonna work.

106
00:07:00.195 --> 00:07:02.075
You need one, one and only one.

107
00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:06.182
If you have one with the same view
transition name, it should make it

108
00:07:06.182 --> 00:07:10.310
morph even if we are talking about
completely different patients.

109
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.148
Because remember, the browser
is taking a snapshot before and

110
00:07:16.148 --> 00:07:18.801
after loading the content.

111
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:23.572
So, I'm going to copy this
style to the index HTML, and

112
00:07:23.572 --> 00:07:28.250
I'm going to find here,
here I have the image, okay?

113
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.872
I can apply it to the image, but remember,
I don't need to apply it to the image.

114
00:07:31.872 --> 00:07:36.968
I can just apply it,
I have a div here, looks like this,

115
00:07:36.968 --> 00:07:41.424
and apply it to the div,
or the image, up to you.

116
00:07:41.424 --> 00:07:47.416
So if I save this now,
let's go back here, let's refresh,

117
00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:53.879
if I click on Fish Tacos, so
now I think that that's pretty cool,

118
00:07:53.879 --> 00:08:00.599
because now it doesn't feel like
you are loading different HTMLs.

119
00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:05.277
And maybe you're thinking why do I
want to do a multi page application?

120
00:08:05.277 --> 00:08:06.550
Okay, that's a different story.

121
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.128
Okay, probably not for
this workshop to get into details, but

122
00:08:10.128 --> 00:08:14.786
there are a lot of situations where making
a client side application is adding more

123
00:08:14.786 --> 00:08:16.357
problems than solutions.

124
00:08:16.357 --> 00:08:20.453
And I mean, think about the newspaper,
website, but

125
00:08:20.453 --> 00:08:25.973
you can still Get an app-like experience
with a blog, if you have a blog,

126
00:08:25.973 --> 00:08:30.781
if it's an e-book,
something like that where it's not really

127
00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:35.794
an app there is some content there
with a lot of HTMLs, Wikipedia.

128
00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:37.920
Do you want Wikipedia to be an app?

129
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.818
Like a client-side app.

130
00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:41.453
Maybe, maybe not.

131
00:08:41.453 --> 00:08:46.446
If it's just HTML documents,
you can upgrade the experience and

132
00:08:46.446 --> 00:08:50.188
convert that in something
that looks like this.

133
00:08:50.188 --> 00:08:54.849
Of course, it doesn't work with
the other ones because I need to go and

134
00:08:54.849 --> 00:08:59.362
change one by one, but I think that
you got the idea of how this work.

135
00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:05.874
Okay, so you just need to define
the same ID for each image.

136
00:09:05.874 --> 00:09:10.838
So you go and set vegetarian pole
as the beauty transition name

137
00:09:10.838 --> 00:09:14.663
on that image and
also on the other one and so on.

138
00:09:14.663 --> 00:09:17.510
So you can still get boot transitions,

139
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:22.092
but for multi page application,
which I think is pretty cool.
