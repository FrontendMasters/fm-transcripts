1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.778
Welcome to the complete intro to React.

2
00:00:03.778 --> 00:00:07.307
I'm Brian Holt, and
I'm very stoked to be here.

3
00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.375
And we are gonna learn how
to do some React today.

4
00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:16.065
This is totally rebuilt from the ground up
from v8, so this is gonna be a lot of fun.

5
00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:24.163
So today, you and I are gonna be building
a pizza delivery app, Padre Gino's.

6
00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:28.727
I recognize that Padre is indeed
Spanish and not Italian, but

7
00:00:28.727 --> 00:00:33.394
it entertained me when the designer
sent it to me, so I kept it.

8
00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:37.618
So it's gonna have a pizza of the day,
it's gonna have a cart,

9
00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:42.340
past orders, a bunch of really cool
stuff that we're gonna do today.

10
00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.180
So let's hop into it.

11
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.616
First of all, I want you to
head to react-v9.holt.courses.

12
00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.164
That should take you here.

13
00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:59.082
And do you see here I have two computers?

14
00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:04.084
Literally, this is my notes that I have up
here, but I shared them with everybody.

15
00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:05.489
These are open source.

16
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.135
These are free, feel free to share these
with your team or with your friends.

17
00:01:10.135 --> 00:01:16.394
That's totally okay,
it's intended that it makes it shareable.

18
00:01:16.394 --> 00:01:19.630
So just to tell you a little bit
how the class is structured,

19
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.146
you'll see here that we have this
section here called Welcome.

20
00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:25.857
And we have the lesson called Intro, and

21
00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:29.384
you'll see that's up here
in the top right as well.

22
00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:33.308
So if you ever get lost and
you're following along here,

23
00:01:33.308 --> 00:01:38.321
you can always just look at the breadcrumb
there to figure out where I am.

24
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:42.221
Okay, so again,
you do not need to have read or

25
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:47.633
watched v8 this is just the the ninth
iteration of this course.

26
00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.542
So just keep that in mind.

27
00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.033
You can start here.

28
00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:55.201
If you're learning React for the first
time, you are in the correct place.

29
00:01:55.201 --> 00:01:59.162
If you're also kinda sharpening your React
skills, you're also in the right place.

30
00:01:59.162 --> 00:02:01.187
So let's just talk about how I
wanna teach this course to you.

31
00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:05.948
I'm a first principles teacher, the style
that resonates with me, and therefore,

32
00:02:05.948 --> 00:02:08.604
it's the way that I try and
teach other people.

33
00:02:08.604 --> 00:02:12.278
The idea there being we're gonna
start by writing React with no tools.

34
00:02:12.278 --> 00:02:16.000
It's just gonna be like
a script tag on an HTML page.

35
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.381
And then we're gonna slowly
add tools as we go along,

36
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:21.569
as we hit barriers of complexity.

37
00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.992
I do this because if you just jump
straight into the full tool set,

38
00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:28.115
you don't understand what's
going underneath the hood.

39
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:32.090
It makes it harder to debug and
you learn to resent your tools,

40
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.998
because tools are complex, but
they also add ease, right?

41
00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:40.328
And if you just get the ease and you
don't understand the complexity that it's

42
00:02:40.328 --> 00:02:44.276
solving, you resent the tool for
the complexity that it adds, right?

43
00:02:44.276 --> 00:02:45.959
So that's my methodology.

44
00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.301
If you don't like it,
you're still stuck on this ride with me.

45
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.981
So bear with me.

46
00:02:51.981 --> 00:02:53.470
Who is this course for?

47
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.551
I'm hoping it's for you, but it's for

48
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:01.631
people looking to get started in React or
deepen their React skills.

49
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.388
This should probably not be the first
time you're writing JavaScript.

50
00:03:05.388 --> 00:03:10.048
If it is, there's some other great
courses on Frontend Masters.

51
00:03:10.048 --> 00:03:11.335
There's ones from Will Sentence.

52
00:03:11.335 --> 00:03:12.298
There's a one from me.

53
00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:15.959
There's a couple really good ones that
will get you up to that kinda speed.

54
00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.305
But again, if you're coming from,
I don't know, Ruby or something like that,

55
00:03:19.305 --> 00:03:22.117
and you're really good at that,
and this is your first JavaScript,

56
00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:23.586
you'll probably stick on, okay?

57
00:03:23.586 --> 00:03:29.396
So YOLO and good luck,
is what I would say to that.

58
00:03:29.396 --> 00:03:32.465
Node, there's no Node.js
experience necessary.

59
00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:37.453
We are gonna use node a little bit
as part of the build process, but

60
00:03:37.453 --> 00:03:42.993
we will not be writing any
Node.js directly in this course.

61
00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:44.714
Okay, who am I?

62
00:03:44.714 --> 00:03:48.216
I'm this handsome
gentleman you see up there.

63
00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:49.160
So my name is Brian.

64
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.529
I've been teaching React and
writing React for a very long time.

65
00:03:52.529 --> 00:03:57.216
My claim to fame is that I launched
Reddit's first React code.

66
00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:02.188
You can see this tweet is dated to 2014.

67
00:04:02.188 --> 00:04:04.961
I mean, very long story short,
one of the developers was like, hey,

68
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.466
this React thing looks interesting.

69
00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:08.961
I was like, no, I don't really want
to write HTML in my JavaScript.

70
00:04:08.961 --> 00:04:10.651
That seems like a bad idea.

71
00:04:10.651 --> 00:04:12.415
And then I wrote it and
it ended up being awesome.

72
00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:15.100
So then we ended up shipping it at Reddit.

73
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.064
That code base eventually turned
into the modern React front end,

74
00:04:19.064 --> 00:04:20.776
which is kind of a fun story.

75
00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.583
I wrote React at a variety
of large companies.

76
00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:29.621
I shipped it at Netflix,
at LinkedIn, certainly Reddit,

77
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:34.168
and then various other
companies since then as well.

78
00:04:34.168 --> 00:04:37.920
I'm now presently at
this company called Neon,

79
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.875
pretty cool company,
worth checking out if you like Postgres.

80
00:04:42.875 --> 00:04:48.160
I'm a staff product manager, and
I've worked, yeah, also at Snowflake,

81
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.303
Microsoft, the other companies I
mentioned some other fun stuff as well.

82
00:04:53.303 --> 00:04:58.163
I've done everything from be VP of product
to DevRel to staff engineer to tech lead.

83
00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:02.462
I've kind of been all over the stack here.

84
00:05:02.462 --> 00:05:05.972
When I'm not working or teaching,
you'll find me hanging out with my wife,

85
00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.976
and my son, and
my soon to arrive daughter.

86
00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:10.356
Lived in Seattle for
the past six years, but

87
00:05:10.356 --> 00:05:14.873
I'm presently moving to Sacramento mostly
so that I can go snowboarding in Tahoe.

88
00:05:14.873 --> 00:05:18.875
That's 90% of the reason why.

89
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:20.649
Feel free to catch up with me.

90
00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:22.919
These are my socials here.

91
00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:24.672
I think they're also on the footer.

92
00:05:24.672 --> 00:05:28.306
I will tell you that I am awful
at responding to DMs, but

93
00:05:28.306 --> 00:05:30.127
please do connect with me.

94
00:05:30.127 --> 00:05:33.215
So I put a little note on
here of where to file issues.

95
00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:36.054
If you have an issue with this course,

96
00:05:36.054 --> 00:05:39.879
please file an issue on
the repo as opposed to DM me.

97
00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:43.317
That way everyone can come and see it and
we can answer the question, and

98
00:05:43.317 --> 00:05:44.361
I can know and fix it.

99
00:05:44.361 --> 00:05:47.843
If it goes into the DMs and it dies in
the DMs and no one can find it later.

100
00:05:47.843 --> 00:05:53.113
So that's why I kinda push people
to file issues or pull requests.

101
00:05:53.113 --> 00:05:56.105
So that's something that you should do.

102
00:05:57.804 --> 00:06:02.100
So how this repo works, so there's a repo
for the class you're currently on.

103
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.390
If you need to fix the notes here,
everything here is in lessons, right?

104
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.475
So it's all organized in kind
of the way that you see there.

105
00:06:08.475 --> 00:06:11.942
And then the project that
you're on is this repo,

106
00:06:11.942 --> 00:06:14.262
which I have up here open as well.

107
00:06:14.262 --> 00:06:17.598
This complete intro to React v9 project.

108
00:06:17.598 --> 00:06:21.752
Please go clone this if
you haven't already.

109
00:06:21.752 --> 00:06:25.551
We'll be using it quite a bit, and
most importantly, the API is in here.

110
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.435
And I'll make mention of this again,
but please, already,

111
00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:32.061
if you haven't cloned this, please do.

112
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:37.012
But you can see this goes in order from 0,
1, to what, 17?

113
00:06:37.012 --> 00:06:38.800
Yeah, I went to 17 here.

114
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.801
These are snapshots at
various points in the course

115
00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.972
that are of complete steps, right?

116
00:06:43.972 --> 00:06:45.834
So if you go into 06, right?

117
00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:50.094
This is a snapshot of what the code
base should look like at that point.

118
00:06:50.094 --> 00:06:53.895
So if something's broken or you wanna
compare what you got versus what I got, or

119
00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:56.237
you just wanna hop into
the middle of the course.

120
00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:59.051
You can just pop in there,
run npm install,

121
00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:01.955
npm run dev and
everything should just work.

122
00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:07.582
And of course, to stroke my fragile ego,
please start this repo.

123
00:07:07.582 --> 00:07:10.643
Click there, It'll start up there.

124
00:07:10.643 --> 00:07:11.474
Makes me feel good.

125
00:07:11.474 --> 00:07:16.025
&gt;&gt; Student: How much will this
course lean into the React 19

126
00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:20.689
specific features like RSCs and
hooks and etc.?

127
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:21.419
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Good question.

128
00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:23.454
How much are we gonna go over React 19?

129
00:07:23.454 --> 00:07:28.445
So today, throughout the course
we're going to be using 18.2.

130
00:07:28.445 --> 00:07:31.374
But you do see at the end
here I have what's next.

131
00:07:31.374 --> 00:07:34.717
And I do have a whole section
on cool stuff coming in 19

132
00:07:34.717 --> 00:07:37.708
that I'm pretty sure is
gonna be mostly stable.

133
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:44.184
And then when we do intermediate React v6,
it's gonna be all React 19 stuff.

134
00:07:44.184 --> 00:07:46.932
Specifically, this course,

135
00:07:46.932 --> 00:07:52.118
complete intro to React is
all about client-side React.

136
00:07:52.118 --> 00:07:53.859
So we're not doing any Node stuff today,

137
00:07:53.859 --> 00:07:55.856
we're not doing any
React server components.

138
00:07:55.856 --> 00:07:58.840
That's all being saved for
intermediate React.

139
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.154
&gt;&gt; Student 2: What's your
opinion on the React team not

140
00:08:02.154 --> 00:08:06.326
recommending plain React
anymore using Next.js?

141
00:08:06.326 --> 00:08:07.972
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's a good question.

142
00:08:07.972 --> 00:08:11.914
There was some controversy about this, and
we'll probably go over this more kind of

143
00:08:11.914 --> 00:08:15.037
throughout the day, but
there's some controversy around that.

144
00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:18.958
The React docs just go straight, just like
just use Remix, or Next, or something like

145
00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.309
that, and they kind of shied people
away from using client-side React.

146
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:24.041
I think it's personally
extremely misguided.

147
00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:29.574
I've been writing client-side React for
a decade and I've done okay for myself.

148
00:08:29.574 --> 00:08:33.607
And the sites that I've worked
on have been plenty fast and

149
00:08:33.607 --> 00:08:38.890
plenty responsive without any concept
of React server-side components.

150
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.175
My thought is that the React
team is solving for

151
00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:46.728
massive enterprise problems
like Facebook-sized problems,

152
00:08:46.728 --> 00:08:52.391
Netflix-sized problems, and most of
us don't have those problems, right?

153
00:08:52.391 --> 00:08:57.962
Client-side React does plenty well
by itself, and so I think it's 100%

154
00:08:57.962 --> 00:09:03.632
viable to ship client-side React without
even having a concept of Next.js.

155
00:09:03.632 --> 00:09:06.727
I'm not at all disparaging Next.js,
or Remix, or any of those.

156
00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:08.829
I also think they're extremely
valuable for what they do.

157
00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:10.735
But if you don't have
those shape of problems,

158
00:09:10.735 --> 00:09:12.461
then you shouldn't use that shape of tool.

159
00:09:12.461 --> 00:09:16.373
I always get a lot of questions about,
hey, Brian, what theme is this, or

160
00:09:16.373 --> 00:09:17.627
how did you set this up?

161
00:09:17.627 --> 00:09:20.498
And so I just have a little section
to get that all out of the way.

162
00:09:20.498 --> 00:09:23.820
Believe me, this isn't for
me, so not for you.

163
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.086
[LAUGH] Cuz otherwise I'll get
endless questions like, hey, Brian,

164
00:09:27.086 --> 00:09:28.537
what theme are you using this?

165
00:09:28.537 --> 00:09:31.584
It's I just use the default dark plus,
it's not really that interesting.

166
00:09:31.584 --> 00:09:37.299
Anyway, so please, I wrote the course,
I think it's actually 20.15,

167
00:09:37.299 --> 00:09:40.708
it might be 20.16, I can't remember it.

168
00:09:40.708 --> 00:09:46.841
But anyway, 20.6 as long as you are Node
20.6 or above, you should be good.

169
00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:50.533
I did try to run this with a Bun,
and it did work.

170
00:09:50.533 --> 00:09:53.676
I'm not gonna say anything after that.

171
00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:54.448
I didn't try it with Deno.

172
00:09:54.448 --> 00:09:58.173
So if you've tried it with Deno,
good luck.

173
00:09:58.173 --> 00:10:01.675
But it did work with Bun
the one time I tried it.

174
00:10:01.675 --> 00:10:06.020
So you might try that if you are very
set that you want to use Bun, but

175
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:11.160
please probably just use Node.js,
cuz you'll probably have a better time.

176
00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.964
My tools, Visual Studio Code,
I used to work on it so

177
00:10:15.964 --> 00:10:20.349
I'm now obligated by
blood oath to use VSCode.

178
00:10:20.349 --> 00:10:24.709
Firefox, I just like that there's more
than one competitor in the browser field,

179
00:10:24.709 --> 00:10:26.964
so I've used Firefox for a very long time.

180
00:10:26.964 --> 00:10:33.310
And then I use Terminal.app,
just the one that ships with MacOS.

181
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:34.855
This course does work on Linux.

182
00:10:34.855 --> 00:10:36.869
It does work on Windows.

183
00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:39.619
I'm not gonna speak too
much to those workflows.

184
00:10:39.619 --> 00:10:42.343
If you're in Linux, I assume you know
what you're doing more than I do.

185
00:10:42.343 --> 00:10:46.306
And if you're in Windows,
probably just use WSL2,

186
00:10:46.306 --> 00:10:48.869
that will simplify a lot of stuff.

187
00:10:50.805 --> 00:10:56.670
Dark plus theme, I use the MonoLisa
font with ligatures installed.

188
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.631
I left a bunch of notes there if
you wanna follow along with that.

189
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:03.135
MonoLisa is not free, but
I look at a font all day, so

190
00:11:03.135 --> 00:11:05.455
I figured I was okay paying for it.

191
00:11:05.455 --> 00:11:09.919
If you want a free one, I like
the Cascadia Code one from Microsoft

192
00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.362
that also has ligatures involved.

193
00:11:12.362 --> 00:11:14.989
I use the VS Code icons extension.

194
00:11:14.989 --> 00:11:17.169
For the terminal, I use zhs.

195
00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:21.149
I use the Dracula theme,
starship prompt, and

196
00:11:21.149 --> 00:11:26.636
the CaskaydiaCove if you wanna
see what I'm talking about here.

197
00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:34.363
This prompt here comes from starship,
and the fact that can say Node.js and

198
00:11:34.363 --> 00:11:38.708
stuff like that, that all comes
from the CaskaydiaCove nerd font.

199
00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:41.729
So I left you all of the links if
you're interested in following

200
00:11:41.729 --> 00:11:43.271
along with the way that I did it.

201
00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:43.951
But again,

202
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:48.311
it's such a common question that I just
feel the need to go through it first.
