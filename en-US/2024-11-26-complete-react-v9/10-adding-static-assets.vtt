00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.340
Let's just go test this out briefly,
and then we'll be good.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.420
So first of all, make sure your
API server is still running.

3
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.841
I still have mine running
here in the background, so

4
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.490
you can see all these requests
coming through just fine.

5
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.694
Let's go to inside pizza.

6
00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:28.384
We're going inside pizza,
inside the div, under the paragraph.

7
00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:33.264
So here we're gonna put

8
00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:39.613
an image src = {props.image}.

9
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.155
And the alt is just gonna be {props.name},

10
00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:50.400
and then self-close that.

11
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.016
So now we'll start having an image, and
then we have to go provide that to it.

12
00:00:57.544 --> 00:01:01.890
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is the line here,
line six is what I added.

13
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.105
Now go to App.jsx.

14
00:01:07.084 --> 00:01:10.804
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And for all of these,
we're just gonna go add an image.

15
00:01:12.954 --> 00:01:16.236
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let me do the fun thing
where you can do multiple cursors at once.

16
00:01:16.236 --> 00:01:18.864
image=

17
00:01:18.864 --> 00:01:28.864
/public/pizzas/pepperoni.webp.

18
00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:38.268
And then we'll just change this for
the Hawaiian, we'll put Hawaiian.

19
00:01:38.268 --> 00:01:42.773
And for the Americano I don't have
a picture of that, thank God,

20
00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:45.076
I didn't wanna scare anybody.

21
00:01:45.076 --> 00:01:47.987
So we'll just put big_meat cuz that's
what I did, I do have that one.

22
00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:53.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, you'll see that
eventually the lines get too long,

23
00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:56.090
it'll start putting all
these on their own lines.

24
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.171
I think it actually makes
it pretty readable but,

25
00:02:04.952 --> 00:02:05.912
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So image,

26
00:02:05.912 --> 00:02:10.834
that's the one there that we
put in those three lines.

27
00:02:16.224 --> 00:02:19.525
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The reason why this
works now is that we have public

28
00:02:19.525 --> 00:02:20.708
available to us.

29
00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:23.649
And again,
if we go back to our GitHub here,

30
00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.760
in the public directory
you see we have style.

31
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.900
We have a nice svg there,
we have a font that we can use later, and

32
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.820
then we have a bunch of these images.

33
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.357
Webp, if you're not familiar
with it is just a file format

34
00:02:37.357 --> 00:02:42.125
from Google that's more efficient
than JPEG or PNG or some of those.

35
00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:45.315
It's also what ChatGPT generates,
and these are all from ChatGPT.

36
00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:54.445
So if they look strangely unappetizing,
that looks terrible.

37
00:02:54.445 --> 00:03:01.487
I think those are supposed to be sardines,
[LAUGH] fantastic.

38
00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:05.128
I'm glad I picked the disgusting one,
not all of them are that bad [LAUGH].

39
00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:12.627
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so you can see
now we have pictures showing up here

40
00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:17.946
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And pretty cool,

41
00:03:17.946 --> 00:03:24.488
one more thing that I want you to go add,
go to your index.html.

42
00:03:24.488 --> 00:03:29.790
We're gonna put a link title here,
a link:css,

43
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.253
and that is just going to go to /public/,
is it style or is it styles?

44
00:03:37.253 --> 00:03:39.980
I can never remember, what did I do here?

45
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.331
Style, okay, /public/style,
right there in your index.html.

46
00:03:52.954 --> 00:03:57.509
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and you should
end up with something like this.

47
00:03:57.509 --> 00:04:02.020
Now we're at 03-jsx,
so if you're behind or

48
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.861
something didn't work and
you wanna go take a look,

49
00:04:06.861 --> 00:04:11.274
just go pop into 03-jsx,
which is this one.

50
00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:15.473
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That is where we are.

51
00:04:20.031 --> 00:04:23.257
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And again,
just to make sure that it's clear,

52
00:04:23.257 --> 00:04:26.653
you need to run two npm
processes at the same time.

53
00:04:26.653 --> 00:04:30.140
You have to be running your API server,
so you have to go into the API,

54
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.046
npm run dev or run start.

55
00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:34.806
You also need Vite
running at the same time.

56
00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:38.083
So in a different terminal,
so open a new terminal, or

57
00:04:38.083 --> 00:04:42.213
if you're in VS code like me,
you can click this little + sign here,

58
00:04:42.213 --> 00:04:47.557
that'll make something, or you can
click the Split, that works as well.

59
00:04:47.557 --> 00:04:51.616
Just a second terminal, however you
choose to manifest it, do that, and

60
00:04:51.616 --> 00:04:55.324
then you'll run npm run dev
inside of your project as well.

61
00:04:55.324 --> 00:04:58.784
So you have both the API server running,
just leave that running.

62
00:04:58.784 --> 00:05:02.964
We don't have to stop that again, and then
your Vite server will be running as well.
