00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.611
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One thing
to keep in mind here,

2
00:00:01.611 --> 00:00:03.698
see that it has some of
these labeled browser,

3
00:00:03.698 --> 00:00:07.189
these ones are ones that actually occur
in the browser and the happy DOM ones.

4
00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.781
You can run those, but it's actually
not occurring in the browser.

5
00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:12.431
It's still occurring in node, and

6
00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:15.022
it's just reporting on stuff
that's coming out of it.

7
00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:17.447
Someone asked earlier about coverage,
which is a good point.

8
00:00:17.447 --> 00:00:20.786
I don't have those in my notes,
but I'm like, Yolo let's check.

9
00:00:20.786 --> 00:00:21.717
I think this should work.

10
00:00:21.717 --> 00:00:25.467
We can just say in here as well
the same coverage stuff we said.

11
00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:31.161
So coverage, text, json, and html,

12
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:36.003
I think, are the three, right?

13
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.741
I'm gonna put those in both.

14
00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:45.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we should get the test
coverage information out of this as well.

15
00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:51.853
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Just run rerun all.

16
00:00:56.334 --> 00:00:59.904
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I don't think the test
coverage stuff necessarily shows up in here.

17
00:00:59.904 --> 00:01:01.740
Yeah, look,
we have our checkout here as well.

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.687
It's kind of cool,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: But in our browser as well,

19
00:01:06.687 --> 00:01:10.853
we can still run our npm run coverage,
and it should still work.

20
00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:12.800
That was my API.

21
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.004
Npm run start there we go, and here,

22
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:21.218
npm run coverage should still work.

23
00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:27.924
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It might not work
with the browser stuff still yeah so

24
00:01:27.924 --> 00:01:32.445
this is kind of the vitest coverage
does not work with Playwright.

25
00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:39.350
So you have to use Istanbul for this one
or just ignore it on your browser tests.

26
00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:45.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's just gonna be
mad at me all the time for it.

27
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:46.865
That's annoying.

28
00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:51.577
Okay, so it looks like if we wanted to,
we would have to switch to Istanbul

29
00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:54.553
totally to keep our
coverage stuff up as well.

30
00:01:54.553 --> 00:02:03.837
So not that that's very hard to,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I mean,

31
00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:06.189
in for a penny, in for a pound, right?

32
00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:19.288
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: vitest coverage,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: v8,

33
00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:25.250
so we'll uninstall that one,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And istanbul.

34
00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.697
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
now Yolo, see what happens.

35
00:02:49.097 --> 00:02:52.105
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
you have to switch to coverage, or

36
00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:56.716
this sub requires chromium as well,
which is kind of fun.

37
00:02:56.716 --> 00:03:00.978
We'll set this to chromium anyway cuz
it'll start up chromium instead of

38
00:03:00.978 --> 00:03:01.604
Firefox.

39
00:03:01.604 --> 00:03:06.874
And then coverage provider,
this has to be,

40
00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:12.158
yeah, that's right, coverage provider,

41
00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:16.972
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Istanbul.

42
00:03:21.097 --> 00:03:23.739
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And, reporter,
is that what it is?

43
00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.433
And this has to be text json html.

44
00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:33.383
And we'll do the exact
same thing over here.

45
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.548
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And try one more time.

46
00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:45.050
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sure.

47
00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:50.929
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
I guess you need both of them to do.

48
00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:52.397
So run it again.

49
00:03:55.534 --> 00:03:56.542
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

50
00:03:56.542 --> 00:04:00.040
Now we're getting full coverage and
all of our tests are working.

51
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.156
And it just required like nine
dependencies, God bless node.

52
00:04:06.156 --> 00:04:09.035
But one cool thing, notice that this is
no longer a nightly, this is on Chromium,

53
00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:10.138
which is pretty cool, right?

54
00:04:10.138 --> 00:04:15.654
And same thing, I think it's pretty
easy for us to just go ahead and

55
00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:21.385
throw, so you can see all my cover
stuff is coming out okay as well..

56
00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:27.405
So I think this does limit us
now to be in Chromium world,

57
00:04:27.405 --> 00:04:34.975
but I think if you wanted to,
you can say webkid, and this will pop up.

58
00:04:34.975 --> 00:04:38.381
It should pop up.

59
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:41.378
Yeah, it's gonna complain
about coverage now, but

60
00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:45.787
if we didn't have all the coverage stuff
in here, it would pop up Safari, right?

61
00:04:45.787 --> 00:04:47.493
You could run all of your tests
in Safari as well, right?

62
00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.473
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right, so
we'll leave it on Chromium and Istanbul,

63
00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:55.666
since we want everything to work together.

64
00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:58.207
So I wanted to say one more thing here.

65
00:04:58.207 --> 00:05:01.182
There's a bit more complicated
browser test case.

66
00:05:01.182 --> 00:05:04.954
If you want to go check it out here,
it goes over things like test ID and

67
00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:05.945
stuff like that.

68
00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:07.353
We're gonna go ahead and
just keep going here.

69
00:05:07.353 --> 00:05:10.269
But if you want to play around
with another test example,

70
00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:11.859
this is what you would look at.

71
00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:16.020
It tests the header in the browser,
which is kind of cool.

72
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.175
So feel free to have a look
at that if you're interested.

73
00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:21.849
And you can also just go ahead and

74
00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.376
download 14-testing because that is all
the testing that we're gonna talk about.
