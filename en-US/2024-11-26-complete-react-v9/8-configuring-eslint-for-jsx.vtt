WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.913
So, I'm gonna say npm
install -D eslint-plugin-react.

2
00:00:09.425 --> 00:00:13.103
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There's just several things
that we kinda want eslint to guard against

3
00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:15.750
with React,
there's just some common patterns.

4
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.243
It's funny, I can't even really tell you
what they are anymore, because eslint has

5
00:00:21.243 --> 00:00:24.278
bloodied me over the years that I've
forgotten how to do the bad things,

6
00:00:24.278 --> 00:00:25.704
which is probably what you want.

7
00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:29.798
Submission by error.

8
00:00:32.673 --> 00:00:36.294
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, that's what we're
gonna go fix right now, yeah, Marc.

9
00:00:36.294 --> 00:00:38.926
&gt;&gt; Marc: Apart from class and className,

10
00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:44.389
are there any gotchas when it comes
to JSX that we should be aware of?

11
00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:47.798
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The other big one
that comes to mind is "for", right,

12
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:50.033
thinking about labels, right?

13
00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:53.190
Label for this input, right?

14
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.520
"For" is also a reserved word in
JavaScript for for loops, right?

15
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.770
So you have to do, instead of, let's
say we had, I don't know, a label here.

16
00:01:07.638 --> 00:01:10.866
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see it
generates it for you, htmlFor, right?

17
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:15.622
And that's just to disambiguate
it from for loops.

18
00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:18.964
That's the other one that comes to mind
that I actually remember off the top

19
00:01:18.964 --> 00:01:19.502
of my head.

20
00:01:19.502 --> 00:01:25.682
I think there are a couple more, but
they're much more rare than those two.

21
00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:34.987
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Other than that,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, there is another one.

22
00:01:34.987 --> 00:01:41.017
If you do input, this is valid HTML,

23
00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:44.717
it is not valid at JSX.

24
00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:47.506
You have to put
the self-closing tag on there,

25
00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:51.440
it's just how JSX is sure to
keep track of things, right?

26
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.278
JSX is designed to not be
as forgiving as a browser,

27
00:01:54.278 --> 00:01:56.857
which I think is generally a benefit,
right?

28
00:01:56.857 --> 00:02:01.746
So anything that's self-closing just
make sure that you put that last

29
00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:05.819
slash in there,
even though that it's valid JavaScript,

30
00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.192
it's not technically valid JSX.

31
00:02:08.192 --> 00:02:12.610
Okay, so we installed npm
eslint-plugin-react@7.37.1 there.

32
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.796
Please open your eslint.config.

33
00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:24.100
We're going to import a eslint, or
sorry, what do we call it here?

34
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.878
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: reactPlugin from

35
00:02:28.878 --> 00:02:36.206
eslint-plugin-react.

36
00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:44.715
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
we're gonna add one more,

37
00:02:44.715 --> 00:02:50.764
let's get rid of this,
one more config object under this.

38
00:02:58.427 --> 00:03:00.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that needs a comma,

39
00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:04.522
and we're gonna add our
react config into this.

40
00:03:04.522 --> 00:03:09.167
So we're gonna say,

41
00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:13.677
...reactPlugin.configs.flat.recommended.

42
00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:20.166
Again, spread operator, this is just
saying merge these two objects together,

43
00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:24.083
give me the union of the two, but we're
going to overwrite the settings of it.

44
00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:29.021
And we're gonna say

45
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:36.071
react:version,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: detect,

46
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:40.155
this one kind of annoys me,
it is necessary,

47
00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:44.027
I don't know why this isn't the default.

48
00:03:44.027 --> 00:03:47.715
The eslint plugin wants to know the
version of React that you're working with,

49
00:03:47.715 --> 00:03:48.770
that tracks, right?

50
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.774
It makes sense that you would want to be
linting for version 19 versus version 16,

51
00:03:52.774 --> 00:03:54.510
they're quite different, right?

52
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.405
There's some difference there, and
they have a really cool feature.

53
00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:04.203
It's like, hey, look at my
package.json and use that, okay?

54
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:07.589
Just always do that, right,
that's always what I want you to do,

55
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:11.164
there's never not the time that I
don't want you to do that, anyway.

56
00:04:11.164 --> 00:04:15.465
Thank you for writing free and open-source
software that I get to use, but

57
00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:19.435
I'm cranky and I don't wanna do
that every single time, but you do.

58
00:04:19.435 --> 00:04:21.327
Anyway, this is what you have
to do every single time.

59
00:04:24.777 --> 00:04:29.650
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So [COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep,

60
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.564
and we need one more here underneath that,

61
00:04:34.564 --> 00:04:39.344
we need a reactPlugin.configs.flat,

62
00:04:39.344 --> 00:04:42.495
one called jsx-runtime.

63
00:04:47.323 --> 00:04:52.084
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This one is the one
that will fix the error around not

64
00:04:52.084 --> 00:04:54.639
importing React, right?

65
00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.528
Cuz otherwise, it's gonna be like,
I expect React and React is not here.

66
00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:00.794
Make sure you added jsx here
if you did not previously,

67
00:05:00.794 --> 00:05:05.198
otherwise it will not lint your jsx files,
which is kinda the damn point.

68
00:05:07.518 --> 00:05:13.335
And then, after language options here,

69
00:05:13.335 --> 00:05:16.666
let's add some rules.

70
00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:19.114
Oops, yeah, rules.

71
00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.093
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: The reason we put rules
here and not in one of these other two,

72
00:05:29.093 --> 00:05:32.513
otherwise, you'll overwrite
their rules configs.

73
00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:37.284
These new eslint configurations
are tricky, right?

74
00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:41.428
So, anyway,
the order becomes extremely important.

75
00:05:41.428 --> 00:05:47.197
So, react has two really
annoying default rules,

76
00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:54.725
and we're just gonna turn them off
cuz I don't wanna deal with it.

77
00:05:54.725 --> 00:05:57.301
No unescaped-entities.

78
00:06:01.542 --> 00:06:05.829
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
it forces you to do weird, it wants you to

79
00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:10.776
directly escape hyphens and
ampersands in your code.

80
00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:13.684
I don't wanna do that,
I want my tools to do that for me.

81
00:06:13.684 --> 00:06:18.368
So I turn that off always and
then react/prop-types.

82
00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:21.878
I don't know why this one still exists,
there used to be a thing called

83
00:06:21.878 --> 00:06:24.796
prop-types, that as soon as
TypeScript became a thing,

84
00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:27.256
just instantly went away
as being useful at all.

85
00:06:27.256 --> 00:06:30.660
But it's still the default that it's on,
I don't get that either.

86
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.208
So, just to drive home,
if you don't have this, you can't write

87
00:06:35.208 --> 00:06:40.014
single quotes inside of your strings,
you have to write, what is it?

88
00:06:40.014 --> 00:06:43.585
And apos, right?

89
00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:46.515
You have to write that
instead of writing that.

90
00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:50.226
And after doing that twice,
I was like, yeah, this shit's for

91
00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:52.388
the birds, I'm not doing it [LAUGH].

92
00:06:52.388 --> 00:06:54.028
So, that's why we're turning that one off.

93
00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:02.965
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, I think we can
leave eslint alone for a while now.

94
00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:05.962
Yea, if you're wondering about flat,

95
00:07:05.962 --> 00:07:10.025
that's the new style of configuration for
eslint 9.

96
00:07:10.025 --> 00:07:13.345
These are flat configs,
which is where that flat word comes from.

97
00:07:15.715 --> 00:07:20.113
Okay, let's go convert app.js now.

98
00:07:20.113 --> 00:07:26.318
So first thing,
rename this file to app.jsx.

99
00:07:27.984 --> 00:07:33.031
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, we're gonna delete
the react import cuz we talked about that.

100
00:07:33.031 --> 00:07:38.253
Import pizza from pizza, we did that and

101
00:07:38.253 --> 00:07:44.405
let's make this a bit
more nice-looking app.

102
00:07:47.649 --> 00:07:55.064
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, return,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: div,

103
00:07:56.921 --> 00:07:58.070
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: <h1>,

104
00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.289
we're gonna call that Padre Gino's - Order Now,

105
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.727
I could just do that in
normal and so it doesn't highlight it.

106
00:08:12.476 --> 00:08:15.063
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then we're gonna do a pizza component,

107
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.282
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like this,

108
00:08:20.282 --> 00:08:26.070
name=Pepperoni.

109
00:08:28.652 --> 00:08:36.359
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Description=,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pep,

110
00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:42.239
cheese, stuff, again, self-closing.

111
00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:49.654
So one thing to call out here,
notice that this is h1, lowercase, h1.

112
00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.989
Notice this is P, Pizza.

113
00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:58.621
I don't do this just by convention,
it's actually required in JSX and React.

114
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:03.218
The lowercase means this is literally
a DOM tag that I would like you to

115
00:09:03.218 --> 00:09:05.368
render just like this, right?

116
00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:08.990
So if I have x-my-webcomponent,

117
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:15.656
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This

118
00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:19.356
means it's gonna expect to actually
render that because this is lowercase.

119
00:09:21.963 --> 00:09:22.913
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Whereas the P,

120
00:09:22.913 --> 00:09:28.111
let's this knows like this is actually
a synthetic one that I've created, right?

121
00:09:28.111 --> 00:09:31.459
And so, you have to name these uppercase.

122
00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:35.196
So, one is both useful just from
like at a glance to be able to tell

123
00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:39.780
what's a DOM component versus what's
a React component that I've created.

124
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:40.965
And it's required by the tools.

125
00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:48.230
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You can see, just like
you give this, like a class name or

126
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:50.653
something like that, right?

127
00:09:50.653 --> 00:09:54.854
You can pass in properties, just like
as if they were like DOM properties.

128
00:09:54.854 --> 00:09:59.906
It's meant to mimic kind of
the same kind of way of doing it.

129
00:10:01.048 --> 00:10:03.411
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
let's make a few more of this,

130
00:10:06.561 --> 00:10:07.530
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Hawaiian,

131
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:15.034
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: ham, pineapple.

132
00:10:20.058 --> 00:10:27.084
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this was,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: french fries.

133
00:10:31.292 --> 00:10:32.257
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

134
00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:37.664
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then this one down here,
instead of having

135
00:10:37.664 --> 00:10:43.931
React.createElement(app), we're
just gonna do App, like that, okay?

136
00:10:43.931 --> 00:10:50.171
Save that, one more thing to do,
go look in your index.html and

137
00:10:50.171 --> 00:10:56.311
we renamed the file, so
we have to put the "x" there, right?

138
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:03.187
See if you're gonna run our project now,
npm run dev, have this open Padre Gino's.

139
00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:11.088
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This was wrong,
so 5173, and

140
00:11:11.088 --> 00:11:15.840
you can see, everything still works.

141
00:11:17.602 --> 00:11:18.603
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pretty cool, right?
