00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I've had a broken
layout here for a little bit.

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.659
If you've been following along, the layout
actually probably was correct, but

3
00:00:07.659 --> 00:00:09.101
I messed some of my divs up.

4
00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:13.540
So let's just go ahead and fix where
some of these actually ended up going.

5
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.092
So one, the order of pizza is actually
supposed to be inside of this,

6
00:00:19.092 --> 00:00:20.447
as is the price.

7
00:00:20.447 --> 00:00:25.319
So we'll just move both of these
inside of the if statement.

8
00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:26.909
That's good.

9
00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:32.509
And then I think down here at the bottom,
I'm closing the div down here.

10
00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.836
That's not actually where it gets closed.

11
00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:42.641
This should be closed right before
the Submit button, I think.

12
00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:46.189
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
it's supposed to be closed here.

13
00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:52.247
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And that should bring
you more to something like this.

14
00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:55.826
I imagine this is what most of
you have been seeing for a while.

15
00:00:55.826 --> 00:01:01.198
And the last thing that I did break,
if you go to App.jsx,

16
00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:05.475
and you just give this
h1 a class name of logo,

17
00:01:05.475 --> 00:01:08.888
you should get a nice Padre Gino's.

18
00:01:08.888 --> 00:01:13.789
One more kind of fun thing that we can do
with hooks here and use PizzaOfTheDay,

19
00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:17.518
we're gonna use one more hook
here called useDebugValue.

20
00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:21.805
I'll be honest, sparingly use this, but
I'm gonna show you cuz it can be useful,

21
00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:24.133
particularly if you have
a large codebase and

22
00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.578
you're maintaining a set of hooks
that a bunch of developers use.

23
00:01:28.868 --> 00:01:33.621
Let's say that we wanna be able to see
at a glance in the React DevTools, what

24
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:39.140
the value of our hook is, because it's not
immediately visible in the component view.

25
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.394
You can kind of give it hints.

26
00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:42.832
So that's what we're gonna do here.

27
00:01:42.832 --> 00:01:45.337
So we're gonna say useDebugValue.

28
00:01:46.747 --> 00:01:52.743
And if we have a PizzaOfTheDay, then
we're just gonna say something like this.

29
00:01:52.743 --> 00:02:00.367
I'm gonna use a template string of,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: pizzaOfTheDay.name.

30
00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:03.595
You can put whatever else
here that you want to,

31
00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:07.965
like maybe,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't

32
00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:13.148
know
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Description.

33
00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:13.940
We'll put description.

34
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.571
I don't know what else here
you would ever wanna see.

35
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.580
Or maybe let's do id.

36
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.379
That's a good one.

37
00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:27.652
Let's do name here, we'll do id first, and
then we'll just put a colon between them.

38
00:02:27.652 --> 00:02:29.293
And then you need a ternary there.

39
00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:36.245
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And if nothing's there,
then you just wanna display loading,

40
00:02:36.245 --> 00:02:36.787
right?

41
00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.181
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So it doesn't return
anything, this is purely for developments.

42
00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:46.198
This is purely for the DevTools.

43
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.840
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: When this is in production
mode, this won't get logged out,

44
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.663
I don't think.

45
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:58.597
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So now,
if we look in the React DevTools and

46
00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:03.097
our components, and
I look at my PizzaOfTheDay,

47
00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:06.484
you can see here,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Tells me my hooks.

48
00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:11.510
And notice this nice-looking
string next to it.

49
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.231
This is the debug value
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Which is kinda nice, right?

50
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.655
So imagine if you have 30
custom hooks in there.

51
00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:26.310
It has nice values for your,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: For

52
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.381
your custom hooks there.

53
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.157
I think you can only use debug value once.

54
00:03:31.157 --> 00:03:34.378
I think if I try and use it again,
it just doesn't do anything, or

55
00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:35.621
maybe it overwrites it.

56
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.291
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, it actually
does give you an array of things.

57
00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:48.766
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Interesting,
didn't used to do that.

58
00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:51.727
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Kinda useful.

59
00:03:55.553 --> 00:03:57.622
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And there's nothing
to stop you from just fully,

60
00:03:57.622 --> 00:03:59.652
just throwing the whole thing on there,
right?

61
00:03:59.652 --> 00:04:02.453
You don't necessarily need
to do that because it will

62
00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:04.940
be inside of your hook, right?

63
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.750
So mostly, it's just something
that you wanna be able to

64
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.150
tell at a glance the difference
between all of them.

65
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.802
In reality, if this really was me,
I probably would just put

66
00:04:11.802 --> 00:04:19.127
the id,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cuz

67
00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:23.805
this is very readable at a glance,
right, the green garden ID, right?

68
00:04:28.548 --> 00:04:33.450
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that is specifically
the very niche use case for useDebugValue,

69
00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.238
is for custom hooks,
identifying them at a glance.
