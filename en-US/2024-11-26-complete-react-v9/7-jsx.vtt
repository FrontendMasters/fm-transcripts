1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.742
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: JSX, and
we're on to core React concepts now.

2
00:00:06.314 --> 00:00:10.164
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So again,
I remember I watched Pete Hunt's talk,

3
00:00:10.164 --> 00:00:14.640
I just don't even remember
which conference was that, but

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.147
this would have been 2014, no 2013.

5
00:00:18.147 --> 00:00:23.212
I would have watched this in 2013, I was
working at Reddit, and he showed this off.

6
00:00:23.212 --> 00:00:24.552
And I was like,
this seems like pretty cool.

7
00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:28.550
And then he started writing his HTML and
his JavaScript, I was like, I'm out,

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.425
I don't like this,
I don't want anything to do with it.

9
00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:36.089
Take your demon magic and go away, right,
[COUGH] it didn't make any sense to me.

10
00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.221
And I was reading the story of
how they ended up creating JSX,

11
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:42.600
is they had created React, and
they think this is a good idea, but

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.563
they had to convince a bunch
of hack developers to use it.

13
00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:50.431
Hack is a flavor of PHP, or
that might be not quite totally true,

14
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:52.788
but it's very similar to PHP.

15
00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:56.576
And so, they hacked together this
last-minute JSX thing to try and

16
00:00:56.576 --> 00:01:01.375
convince them, and that's like, the PHP
developers were like, this is cool.

17
00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:02.971
We can use this, right?

18
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:05.788
And then it turned out to be really
popular back with the JavaScript

19
00:01:05.788 --> 00:01:06.706
developers as well.

20
00:01:06.706 --> 00:01:08.690
And so that's how JSX ended up taking off.

21
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.630
It was never intended to be the core use
case for React, and yet it still is.

22
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.702
And now not only does react use it,
but solid JS uses it, you can use it

23
00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:24.582
with like Vite or with View and some other
things as well, so it really took off.

24
00:01:24.582 --> 00:01:28.880
So let me tell you about why I came back
around when someone reframed this for me.

25
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.679
Again, I'm old enough to
remember JavaScript in our HTML.

26
00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.600
Where you click like an on click handler,
and all the JavaScript was just shoved

27
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.994
into the HTML, and it was gross,
it was hard to debug.

28
00:01:41.994 --> 00:01:45.122
It was like trying to debug minified code.

29
00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:47.678
It was like landmines
throughout all of your HTML.

30
00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:49.199
And it was just the worst.

31
00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:53.149
And I spent a good part of my first job
ripping JavaScript out of HTML, and so

32
00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:55.174
the inverse sounded just as bad to me.

33
00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:58.571
Is like,
I don't want HTML in my JavaScript, right?

34
00:01:58.571 --> 00:02:03.579
The reframing that finally
got me to accept JSX, or

35
00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:10.227
at least try it out for a longer time,
is we just wrote this, right?

36
00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:15.129
React.createElement("h1", { id:
"main-title" }, "My Website").

37
00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.175
What is this supposed to
end up translating to?

38
00:02:19.175 --> 00:02:21.765
It's supposed to be this, right?

39
00:02:21.765 --> 00:02:27.383
We're literally writing
code that mimics HTML.

40
00:02:27.383 --> 00:02:30.389
Shouldn't we just write the HTML, right?

41
00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.164
Instead of trying to mimic it.

42
00:02:32.164 --> 00:02:34.475
And when I kind of had that reframe,
I was like, okay,

43
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:36.064
that actually makes a lot of sense to me.

44
00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:40.291
And when I understood how JSX is just
a very, very thin layer on top of

45
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:45.057
JavaScript, it's not really adding
barely any semantics to JavaScript.

46
00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:48.205
I was like, okay,
I think I can tolerate this, and

47
00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:51.217
I have to have a build step anyway,
so who cares?

48
00:02:51.217 --> 00:02:57.372
So this is what our pizza
ends up looking like.

49
00:02:57.372 --> 00:02:58.987
In fact, let's just go write that.

50
00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:01.345
So open your App.js.

51
00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:06.395
Let's actually just create a new
file here and call it Pizza.js,

52
00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:10.914
and then we're gonna add just
one more character here, x.

53
00:03:14.358 --> 00:03:17.384
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna make our pizza component,

54
00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:21.242
we're gonna move that out
of App.js into Pizza.jsx.

55
00:03:21.242 --> 00:03:24.312
Now, if you've watched previous
versions of this course,

56
00:03:24.312 --> 00:03:26.299
you'll notice that I have gone back and

57
00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.171
forth several 100 times from using JSX
as the extension to just using JS.

58
00:03:30.171 --> 00:03:35.539
And let me explain to you why, initially,
we had to call it JSX because the tools

59
00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:40.290
required it, or else it wouldn't
transfile from JSX to JavaScript.

60
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.087
And then famously,
Dan Abramov, who's a well-known

61
00:03:45.087 --> 00:03:49.577
JavaScript engineer that was at Reddit,
or sorry,

62
00:03:49.577 --> 00:03:55.205
he was at Facebook, he created Redux,
and now he's at Bluesky.

63
00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:58.779
He tweeted one time,
why is everyone calling this JSX?

64
00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.123
It's just JavaScript.

65
00:04:00.123 --> 00:04:05.034
And that caused a massive swing in
the JavaScript community to go back

66
00:04:05.034 --> 00:04:07.924
to the other way of just calling it .js.

67
00:04:07.924 --> 00:04:11.964
And so again, I try and just follow
the sea trends but this particular course

68
00:04:11.964 --> 00:04:16.591
of what you'll normally see in the wild,
if you're a professional React developer.

69
00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:22.338
The reason why is we're back on JSX now
for this course, is Vite requires it.

70
00:04:22.338 --> 00:04:26.850
Vite will not run the JSX
transformation unless you call it .jsx.

71
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.386
I don't even know if you can configure
that away, I didn't really try.

72
00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:36.504
So we're back on JSX now, but I hope my
point to you is that it doesn't matter.

73
00:04:36.504 --> 00:04:37.348
Who cares, right?

74
00:04:37.348 --> 00:04:39.506
Like, it's like the dumbest
thing to argue about.

75
00:04:39.506 --> 00:04:45.365
Just do whatever your tools require, and
don't think much more about it than that.

76
00:04:45.365 --> 00:04:48.301
Okay, so go ahead and copy and paste.

77
00:04:48.301 --> 00:04:54.441
I'm gonna just cut this out of here, and
I'm gonna put this in my Pizza file.

78
00:04:54.441 --> 00:04:58.042
I'm gonna put an export
default Pizza at the bottom.

79
00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:05.406
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
we're gonna just comment this, and

80
00:05:05.406 --> 00:05:09.190
I'm just gonna re implement it with JSX.

81
00:05:14.115 --> 00:05:21.783
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, const Pizza = (props).

82
00:05:25.764 --> 00:05:30.374
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you're gonna return,
I'm gonna suggest here that you

83
00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:35.086
put an opening parenthesis,
I'll tell you why in a second.

84
00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:38.713
And you're just gonna start
writing your HTML, div.

85
00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:46.203
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We didn't give this a class
before, but we're gonna give one now.

86
00:05:46.203 --> 00:05:49.694
But notice we're gonna call it class name,
I think they've gone back and

87
00:05:49.694 --> 00:05:51.622
forth if they're gonna get rid of this.

88
00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:55.638
Anyway, the reason why they have
you call this class name and

89
00:05:55.638 --> 00:06:00.286
not class is technically,
the word class in JavaScript is reserved,

90
00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:02.596
right, for JavaScript classes.

91
00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:07.072
And so they didn't want to collide with
that, so they called it class name.

92
00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:10.252
Which is actually, I mean,

93
00:06:10.252 --> 00:06:15.420
if you have a x = document.getElementById,

94
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:19.006
blah, you don't have to copy.

95
00:06:19.006 --> 00:06:21.472
I'm just proving a point.

96
00:06:21.472 --> 00:06:26.547
The way that you would get the class
name of x would be class names.

97
00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:29.449
They went with the actual
name of the JavaScript API,

98
00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:31.394
that's just where that came from.

99
00:06:31.394 --> 00:06:32.985
They didn't make it up, right?

100
00:06:32.985 --> 00:06:37.718
Anyway, you'll get used to it, but you
do have to call it class name instead of

101
00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:42.700
class, and your tools will catch that for
you, so don't worry too much about it.

102
00:06:44.703 --> 00:06:47.704
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
then we're gonna have an h1.

103
00:06:47.704 --> 00:06:53.066
Now, I could put props.name here,
but what would happen?

104
00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:56.754
It would literally display the text,
props.name.

105
00:06:56.754 --> 00:06:59.184
But if I surround it with curly braces,

106
00:06:59.184 --> 00:07:02.141
you can put in here any
JavaScript expression.

107
00:07:02.141 --> 00:07:05.677
And so, your question might be,
what is a JavaScript expression?

108
00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:09.098
It's anything that can go on
the right side of an equal sign.

109
00:07:09.098 --> 00:07:15.847
So, I could put,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Right,

110
00:07:15.847 --> 00:07:21.320
this right half of it would
be an expression, right?

111
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:27.381
So I can put props.name.toLocaleUppercase,
and that'll work, right?

112
00:07:31.332 --> 00:07:36.501
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
same thing with our paragraph here,

113
00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:39.300
props.description.

114
00:07:41.248 --> 00:07:43.297
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And there you go.

115
00:07:43.297 --> 00:07:44.813
That is JSX.

116
00:07:49.694 --> 00:07:52.743
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Pretty straightforward,
I think, right?

117
00:07:52.743 --> 00:08:00.190
I think it's simpler,
compare this with this.

118
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:06.734
I'm gonna say, almost certainly, unless
your brain is broken, [LAUGH] like mine,

119
00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:12.190
which is frequently broken,
this is just way easier to read, right?

120
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.686
This is actually what you mean, right?

121
00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:17.195
This is the markup you intend to generate.

122
00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:20.396
This is mimicking markup
that you intend to generate.

123
00:08:20.396 --> 00:08:22.372
Okay, any questions about this?

124
00:08:25.382 --> 00:08:29.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm a bit curious
about the use of the default.

125
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.291
It probably doesn't have a meaningful
distinction with a simple app like this,

126
00:08:34.291 --> 00:08:37.505
but can you give an example
of when you might not want it

127
00:08:37.505 --> 00:08:39.161
to be your default export?

128
00:08:39.161 --> 00:08:41.853
I know it's related to
the module that you're exposed,

129
00:08:41.853 --> 00:08:44.104
I kind of don't understand
the concept there.

130
00:08:44.104 --> 00:08:48.556
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, so
I have down here, export default Pizza.

131
00:08:48.556 --> 00:08:54.188
And if we go over here, we need to
import this from the other file, right?

132
00:08:54.188 --> 00:08:59.921
So we're gonna say,
import Pizza from .Pizza, right?

133
00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:03.424
The fact that this has no curly braces
around it means that it is the default

134
00:09:03.424 --> 00:09:05.416
export of this particular file, right?

135
00:09:05.416 --> 00:09:10.646
So because I said default, you import
it over here with no curly braces.

136
00:09:10.646 --> 00:09:14.395
Now, if I wanted to do it differently,

137
00:09:14.395 --> 00:09:18.496
you could say export const Pizza = Pizza.

138
00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:28.611
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I forgot exactly what the
syntax is because I never do it this way,

139
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:30.828
but you would do something like this.

140
00:09:39.114 --> 00:09:44.191
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
now this is a named export here.

141
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.233
And so now over here you
would import this like this.

142
00:09:50.479 --> 00:09:53.306
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, why would you ever
wanna do it one way versus the other?

143
00:09:53.306 --> 00:09:56.159
When you have named exports,
now I can do multiple exports here.

144
00:09:56.159 --> 00:10:03.660
I can do export const blah equals, right?

145
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:08.561
And now I can import two things over here,
blah.

146
00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:12.449
People have very strong opinions about
how you're supposed to do this or

147
00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:13.796
not supposed to do this.

148
00:10:13.796 --> 00:10:17.933
Some people are like, named exports all
the time, default is an anti-pattern, and

149
00:10:17.933 --> 00:10:19.781
to those people I say, I don't care.

150
00:10:19.781 --> 00:10:25.752
[LAUGH] I just don't care,
it's the dumbest thing to argue about.

151
00:10:25.752 --> 00:10:28.851
I'm generally of an opinion that one file,

152
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:33.558
one component, so therefore,
default exports make sense to me.

153
00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:37.075
It's kind of a reliable pattern for me.

154
00:10:37.075 --> 00:10:42.118
Sometimes I'll do something where
you can have both, by the way.

155
00:10:42.118 --> 00:10:43.999
Which would look like this.

156
00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:47.786
Some of them would be inside of
the curly braces, some wouldn't be.

157
00:10:47.786 --> 00:10:52.575
And I will do this from time to time,
it actually will look more like this.

158
00:10:52.575 --> 00:10:56.880
So I'll have the Pizza one from this,
and then I'll have like,

159
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.746
testPizza, where I'll have to have
a little like additional logic to be

160
00:11:01.746 --> 00:11:04.164
able to test it correctly, right?

161
00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:08.700
And I'll have it do something like that,
right?

162
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:13.019
But generally speaking, I'm a one file,
one component kind of person, and

163
00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:14.756
this makes a lot of sense to me.

164
00:11:14.756 --> 00:11:18.267
One thing I'm gonna call out here is,

165
00:11:18.267 --> 00:11:23.665
notice that you used to have
to do import React from react.

166
00:11:23.665 --> 00:11:28.538
We don't have to do this anymore.

167
00:11:28.538 --> 00:11:33.314
So, remember how this gets transpiled
to React.createElement, right?

168
00:11:33.314 --> 00:11:35.976
So anywhere that you were doing React,

169
00:11:35.976 --> 00:11:40.582
you had to import React even though
you weren't directly using it.

170
00:11:40.582 --> 00:11:44.504
Luckily the tools got smart enough to say,
okay, if we see JSX,

171
00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:46.696
we're gonna import React for you.

172
00:11:46.696 --> 00:11:50.610
So, not required anymore,
but it used to be required.

173
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.843
But you might see that in older
codebases that haven't updated

174
00:11:53.843 --> 00:11:55.435
their build configurations.
