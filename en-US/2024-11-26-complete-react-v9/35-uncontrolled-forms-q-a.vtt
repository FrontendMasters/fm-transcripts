00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.485
I guess I just had a thought, I kind of
answered it for myself here, but we put in

2
00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:08.771
those DevTools, we put in the React and
the TanStack DevTools, and I was curious.

3
00:00:08.771 --> 00:00:12.816
My question to myself was, hey,
can I inspect that call just there?

4
00:00:12.816 --> 00:00:17.188
And I absolutely can, but I'm wondering
if, I guess maybe this is general for

5
00:00:17.188 --> 00:00:21.096
now or later, if there are any common
uses you have of those DevTools,

6
00:00:21.096 --> 00:00:25.697
kind of think that we put them in there,
and I haven't really touched them since.

7
00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:29.716
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, to get point here
you can click the TanStack Query,

8
00:00:29.716 --> 00:00:34.323
DevTools down here, you see both
quarries and mutation up here,

9
00:00:34.323 --> 00:00:37.620
you can see our query,
mutation right there.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.970
This is just helpful for me to see,
did it happen and what data got sent?

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.490
That's 95% of my question.

12
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.403
The other thing I could definitely
just look at the network tab right?

13
00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:52.257
And see what happened there but
it's nice that it's here.

14
00:00:52.257 --> 00:00:56.451
I can see everything,
what happened, what came back,

15
00:00:56.451 --> 00:01:01.816
how many things are subscribed to it,
what kind of event triggered it?

16
00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:03.039
All that kind of stuff.

17
00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.783
So do I need to see,
is it cancelable all the time?

18
00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:13.471
No, probably not or probably never is
probably closer to what I would say,

19
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:16.016
but it's cool that it's there.

20
00:01:16.016 --> 00:01:17.880
&gt;&gt; Male Student 2: When
there are input validations,

21
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.997
should we be using uncontrolled forms?

22
00:01:19.997 --> 00:01:24.851
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Not necessarily it
depends on how you wanna do it.

23
00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:30.801
So, first of all, the browser
already has some built into it.

24
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:36.778
So if I just do this, it's gonna say,
please enter an email address.

25
00:01:36.778 --> 00:01:38.440
That's from Firefox, right?

26
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.922
That's not from anything.

27
00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:43.457
That's just from Firefox saying
this isn't at least remotely

28
00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.533
approaching a valid email address.

29
00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:46.853
It's pretty loose, right?

30
00:01:46.853 --> 00:01:49.898
So it will still allow some
pretty weird things through.

31
00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:52.953
It probably will let that go,
it did, right?

32
00:01:52.953 --> 00:01:57.373
And that's not about,
obviously not a valid email address.

33
00:01:57.373 --> 00:02:00.746
But if you were trying to do
a valid date of birth, right?

34
00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:04.930
And you wanna make sure that it's
within the past 150 years, or

35
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.357
something like that.

36
00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:11.901
I still probably would do
that on submit and why?

37
00:02:11.901 --> 00:02:15.606
It's a huge pet peeve of mine.

38
00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:20.216
If I started typing my birthday,
which is 05 and then it turns red and

39
00:02:20.216 --> 00:02:22.260
it's enter a valid birthday.

40
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.752
It's I'm not done yet.

41
00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:27.758
[LAUGH] Stop telling me that I don't
have a valid, I'm working on it.

42
00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:31.311
And so that's why I don't like using
a controlled input because it would

43
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:34.064
immediately show you that
something is wrong, right?

44
00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:36.356
When in reality,
you wanna show them at the end.

45
00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:42.190
It's no, actually, you have to be
born within past 150 years for

46
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.244
this to be valid, you would do that
on submit, not on key down, right?

47
00:02:48.244 --> 00:02:53.362
So still I would do uncontrolled for
that and

48
00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:59.183
then just do it on the submit
where I would do that.

49
00:03:00.634 --> 00:03:02.824
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know,
there's probably other reasons as well.

50
00:03:02.824 --> 00:03:03.575
&gt;&gt; Male Student 3: In my page,

51
00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:08.925
it has fields which has dependencies on
other fields for instance, state and city.

52
00:03:08.925 --> 00:03:10.920
For that, should we use controlled forms?

53
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.592
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
that's a really good place to do it.

54
00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:17.808
So let's say you put zip code, right?

55
00:03:17.808 --> 00:03:20.717
And for example,
in my old zip code in the Seattle,

56
00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:23.357
you could see this that
you live in Seattle, or

57
00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:27.576
you could say you live in Greenwood,
both are technically valid places.

58
00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:31.214
And you would show that,
probably in a drop down.

59
00:03:31.214 --> 00:03:35.982
And you would do that based on zip
code which wouldn't be populated until

60
00:03:35.982 --> 00:03:40.768
they put their zip code in that you
would use a controlled input for that.

61
00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:45.996
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm not
telling you do great,

62
00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:49.769
terrible things to avoid
using controlled inputs.

63
00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.531
But just mostly that they're not necessary
for things of this nature, right?

64
00:03:55.531 --> 00:04:01.079
Where this is pretty extremely
normal-looking form, right?

65
00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.038
And therefore, it's very valid to just not
have to do anything controlled about it.

66
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:16.095
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, again,
we didn't hit any errors, but

67
00:04:16.095 --> 00:04:22.750
let's say that we hit a 500 or
was it 437 I am a teapot error, right?

68
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.997
Something like that but inside of
postContact, if this response was

69
00:04:27.997 --> 00:04:33.433
not okay, which is basically
anything that's under 400, right?

70
00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:37.628
It would throw the error here.

71
00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:41.647
And then inside of contact,

72
00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:46.838
we would get a flag here from TanStack

73
00:04:46.838 --> 00:04:52.028
query and you could do something if,

74
00:04:52.028 --> 00:04:56.728
where's a mutation.isError.

75
00:04:56.728 --> 00:05:02.654
And you can see there's a bunch of them,
isPending, isPaused, isIdle, isSuccess,

76
00:05:02.654 --> 00:05:07.708
blah, blah, but if error,
you can just, return something again,

77
00:05:07.708 --> 00:05:12.792
very customer friendly,
lol no, something like that, right?

78
00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:17.861
And that's how you'd handle
errors in their posts, yeah Marc?

79
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:22.222
&gt;&gt; Marc: Is there a case where you
use both uncontrolled forms, but

80
00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:23.828
a controlled input?

81
00:05:23.828 --> 00:05:32.447
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, I mean, you can
kind of see that I do that in order.

82
00:05:36.772 --> 00:05:39.990
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you look here,
we have this whole form.

83
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.819
But I'm handling all of
the data on submit, and

84
00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.513
then where am I taking that data?

85
00:05:46.513 --> 00:05:48.296
So this is setCard.

86
00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:52.857
So I guess I'm just doing this directly
with the things that I have set in state.

87
00:05:52.857 --> 00:05:57.000
But there's no reason that
I couldn't have just done

88
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.429
something like const
formData = new FormData, right?

89
00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:05.196
And done it the exact same way.

90
00:06:05.196 --> 00:06:08.547
Both are fine, at this point, you're kind
of splitting hairs of what's controlled

91
00:06:08.547 --> 00:06:12.054
and what's uncontrolled, and really the
answer is it doesn't really matter, right?

92
00:06:12.054 --> 00:06:14.943
Just write the code that looks the best.

93
00:06:14.943 --> 00:06:16.398
But sure, yeah,

94
00:06:16.398 --> 00:06:22.222
you're gonna have things where some
of the inputs will be controlled.

95
00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:24.610
Some of them will not be controlled, and

96
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.344
you'll get it all off the form
data that would make sense to me.

97
00:06:28.344 --> 00:06:32.835
It's not a binary thing, where either
it's all controlled or all uncontrolled.

98
00:06:32.835 --> 00:06:33.821
You can do both.
