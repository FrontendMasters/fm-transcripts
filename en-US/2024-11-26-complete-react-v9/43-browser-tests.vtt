1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.408
Let's do some experimental stuff,

2
00:00:02.408 --> 00:00:07.546
experimental browser stuff that's
actually probably even more dangerous.

3
00:00:07.546 --> 00:00:12.424
So everything that I just taught you,
100% of it, applicable today, go forth to

4
00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:16.516
your companies and use everything
that I just taught you about vitest.

5
00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.583
This is all tried and true science so far,

6
00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.076
I'm gonna show you what's
what's coming next.

7
00:00:21.076 --> 00:00:24.841
And I almost taught this to you as
the way to go, no matter what, but

8
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:29.108
it's just not stable enough for
me to recommend yet, so I'm not going to.

9
00:00:29.108 --> 00:00:33.837
But it's soon, the answer is, soon this
will be stable enough for you to do, so

10
00:00:33.837 --> 00:00:35.470
I want you to know about it.

11
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.849
So, come into your project and
we're gonna do nmp

12
00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:46.617
install-D at vitest/browser at 2.1.3 we're

13
00:00:46.617 --> 00:00:52.395
gonna need playwright,
which is a Microsoft thing.

14
00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:57.994
If you've heard of Puppeteer, this is kind
of the spiritual successor to Puppeteer,

15
00:00:57.994 --> 00:01:00.766
it's literally the same person, Pavel.

16
00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:05.688
He created Puppeteer at Google, and then
Microsoft stole them, and then he created

17
00:01:05.688 --> 00:01:10.284
playwright at Microsoft, so he was just
kinda continuing on the line of work.

18
00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:17.034
The test-browser-react, and
you can see how experimental this is,

19
00:01:17.034 --> 00:01:22.446
it's 0.0, 0.1,
experimental and not done yet.

20
00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:25.731
So I'll also say like,
this one is, in particular,

21
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:30.549
liable to be broken by the time that you
run this because they'll probably have

22
00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.079
changed this several times, so
you might need to debug this a little bit.

23
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
we have that, we now have to go and

24
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.600
create a vitest.config file.

25
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.548
So we're gonna create a new file,

26
00:01:51.548 --> 00:01:56.588
we're gonna call it vitest.config.js,

27
00:01:56.588 --> 00:02:01.490
we're gonna import, define workspace,

28
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.820
define workspace from vitest.config.js.

29
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.577
We're kinda hacking around
a little bit there,

30
00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:15.535
you can leave the .js,
it doesn't have to be there either way.

31
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:19.717
Workspaces is actually for
monorepos, so if you have like,

32
00:02:19.717 --> 00:02:24.965
seven packages in one repo, you can
define different vitest workspaces for

33
00:02:24.965 --> 00:02:28.987
each one of them,
that's the point of define workspace.

34
00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:32.757
But we're gonna use it to define
a happy-dom environment for

35
00:02:32.757 --> 00:02:37.540
our old tests and a playwright environment
for our new tests cuz I don't want to

36
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.899
rewrite our old tests if
there's still good, right?

37
00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:46.001
And I just want to write new
test in our browser way,

38
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:53.728
so we're gonna export default define
workspace and it's gonna be an array.

39
00:02:53.728 --> 00:02:57.386
And you're basically,

40
00:02:57.386 --> 00:03:02.437
two different config files here,

41
00:03:02.437 --> 00:03:08.532
so the first one we're gonna make sure you

42
00:03:08.532 --> 00:03:16.042
have extends ./vitet.config.js, and test.

43
00:03:16.042 --> 00:03:20.571
So basically, this is saying bring
everything in from this file here,

44
00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:25.023
my vite file, and I'm going to just
overwrite the test part of it, and

45
00:03:25.023 --> 00:03:30.976
we're gonna say include,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We

46
00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:39.390
only wanna test files that have,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: .node.test.js or

47
00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.607
jsx, let's see the one of those, okay?

48
00:03:44.607 --> 00:03:48.399
These ones are all going to be
run in the happy-dom environment.

49
00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:55.796
So we're gonna say name,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Call them happy-dom,

50
00:03:55.796 --> 00:04:01.078
and environment,
we're going to set to be happy-dom.

51
00:04:03.265 --> 00:04:07.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So basically, all of our
existing tests we wanna run in happy-dom,

52
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.518
and we're gonna have to go rename all
of them to have .node in the title.

53
00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:16.695
That's why I said later that the name
of this one's gonna get even more

54
00:04:16.695 --> 00:04:22.250
ridiculous cuz it's gonna have to
be contact.lazy.node.test .jsx.

55
00:04:25.043 --> 00:04:29.061
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's both absurd, but I
also, I can't really do anything about it,

56
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:30.977
It does have to kinda be that way.

57
00:04:30.977 --> 00:04:36.944
So that's fine, and
then we're gonna have a new one,

58
00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:41.226
we're gonna write new tests with, and

59
00:04:41.226 --> 00:04:47.842
that is going to be extends I
guess we don't need the quotes,

60
00:04:47.842 --> 00:04:54.092
extends, same thing,
vite config.js, test, okay?

61
00:04:54.092 --> 00:04:56.931
And this one has a little
bit more involved setup,

62
00:04:56.931 --> 00:04:58.966
it's gonna have some setup files.

63
00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.447
This is just things that get run
before your test get run and

64
00:05:02.447 --> 00:05:04.876
we're gonna put vitest browser react.

65
00:05:04.876 --> 00:05:09.152
we're gonna make sure that that
gets run before our test get run,

66
00:05:09.152 --> 00:05:13.757
we're going to include anything that
we include browser in the test.

67
00:05:13.757 --> 00:05:17.696
So, the other thing
instead of doing .node or

68
00:05:17.696 --> 00:05:22.948
.browser we could have just put
them in separate directories

69
00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:28.201
that would have been fine as well,
that's totally up to you.

70
00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:31.176
I think this just made me laugh,
and so I kept doing it,

71
00:05:31.176 --> 00:05:35.532
chaos driven development, if you will,
name we're gonna call this browser.

72
00:05:35.532 --> 00:05:38.777
The reason why we're putting the name here
is so that when we're looking at our test,

73
00:05:38.777 --> 00:05:40.627
it'll it'll actually
give you a little label,

74
00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:41.999
it says this was run in the browser.

75
00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:48.419
This was run in happy-dom, and
it makes it easy to tell at a glance,

76
00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:53.615
browser, and
we're gonna say provider, provider.

77
00:05:53.615 --> 00:05:59.330
And your two choices are playwright,
which I strongly suggest you go with,

78
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.524
I think you can also use web driver,
which is Selenium, same thing.

79
00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:12.655
Enabled true and name, here you can put
what browser you would like to test in.

80
00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:17.540
I'm gonna test in Firefox but
feel free to put

81
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.207
Chromium can go there or
WebKit if you're on Mac OS.

82
00:06:23.207 --> 00:06:28.583
But if you want to test in Chrome,
you put Chromium here,

83
00:06:28.583 --> 00:06:32.283
I think you can put Edge there, maybe?

84
00:06:32.283 --> 00:06:36.133
Don't quote me on that one, anyway,
Firefox, that's what I'm putting there,

85
00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:36.687
all right?

86
00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:40.887
So let's go rename these so

87
00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:47.648
that they have node .node contact.node,

88
00:06:47.648 --> 00:06:50.579
nope, not there.

89
00:06:50.579 --> 00:06:55.541
It sucks, but unfortunately,
the order is important, node, so

90
00:06:55.541 --> 00:06:58.385
contact.lazy.node.test.jsx.

91
00:07:04.042 --> 00:07:07.853
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And pizza of the day,
I'm gonna put this.

92
00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.374
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
those are all of our node tests.

93
00:07:17.077 --> 00:07:20.234
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
if I remember correctly, yeah, so

94
00:07:20.234 --> 00:07:25.210
cart one this actually,
that can be run in the browser because

95
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.867
playwright already does snapshot testing.

96
00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:31.094
So, this actually will run
in either one of them,

97
00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:34.183
and so we might as well just throw
this into our browser environment.

98
00:07:34.183 --> 00:07:38.530
So rather than cart.node,
we're gonna do cart.browser,

99
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:43.629
these other ones actually depend on
the fact that we're in happy-dom,

100
00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.406
and they could be rewritten
to work with the browser.

101
00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:51.889
I just don't want to make you do that
because I don't think that's a useful

102
00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.607
exercise for you right now.

103
00:07:53.607 --> 00:07:58.510
But we are gonna create another pizza
test, so we're gonna create pizza.browser.

104
00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:03.618
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna do that.

105
00:08:08.844 --> 00:08:13.024
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, all right,
let's go write our test, so

106
00:08:13.024 --> 00:08:18.197
in pizza.browser.test.jsx,
import render from,

107
00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:23.370
and we're gonna get it
from vitest-browser-react,

108
00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.789
so this library aims to
mimic testing library.

109
00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:33.425
So we actually don't need testing library
at all in the browser-based environment,

110
00:08:33.425 --> 00:08:37.904
because vitest-browser-react does
all of the things that testing

111
00:08:37.904 --> 00:08:41.857
library would do for us,
it aims to be mostly API compliant.

112
00:08:41.857 --> 00:08:46.780
So, if you have questions about it,
just go look at the testing library docs,

113
00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.182
it's usually the same thing, okay?

114
00:08:49.182 --> 00:08:54.397
Expect and test from vitest,

115
00:08:54.397 --> 00:09:00.863
import Pizza from src/Pizza,

116
00:09:00.863 --> 00:09:04.415
capital P, Pizza.

117
00:09:04.415 --> 00:09:09.239
Okay, we're gonna test alt
text renders on image, and so

118
00:09:09.239 --> 00:09:16.623
we're gonna test the same thing, but we're
gonna do in a browser-based environment,

119
00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:20.673
the test is gonna end up
looking pretty similar.

120
00:09:20.673 --> 00:09:26.737
Const name = My favorite pizza,

121
00:09:26.737 --> 00:09:31.933
const src = our nice looking

122
00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:39.729
picture there pick some photo/200 and

123
00:09:39.729 --> 00:09:44.288
const screen = render.

124
00:09:44.288 --> 00:09:48.142
Pizza name = name,

125
00:09:48.142 --> 00:09:53.048
src = src,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

126
00:09:53.048 --> 00:09:56.028
it's not src, it's image, sorry.

127
00:09:56.028 --> 00:09:58.984
Image = source and

128
00:09:58.984 --> 00:10:04.721
description = cool browser stuff.

129
00:10:04.721 --> 00:10:09.916
Close your tag there, and we're gonna

130
00:10:09.916 --> 00:10:16.063
say const image = await
screen.get by role.

131
00:10:20.447 --> 00:10:23.627
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And the matches end up
looking a little bit different we have to

132
00:10:23.627 --> 00:10:25.292
use this expect element thing.

133
00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:30.347
Or say const or await, expect

134
00:10:30.347 --> 00:10:36.625
element image to be in the document.

135
00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:43.131
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we expect it to
render an image at all, right?

136
00:10:43.131 --> 00:10:47.211
Let's just make two of these here,

137
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:50.892
I'm gonna say to have attribute

138
00:10:53.005 --> 00:10:58.745
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Src, src and to have

139
00:10:58.745 --> 00:11:04.828
attribute alt name.

140
00:11:04.828 --> 00:11:08.687
So, if you're looking at this, its like,
this looks pretty similar, right?

141
00:11:08.687 --> 00:11:14.160
And not totally the same, just to put
them side by side, just for a second.

142
00:11:21.256 --> 00:11:23.845
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: See the screen here,
screen here, and

143
00:11:23.845 --> 00:11:28.645
this one you're just able to just
do these synchronous checks, right?

144
00:11:28.645 --> 00:11:32.551
Cuz it's just really reading text out of
a document, this is the whole browser,

145
00:11:32.551 --> 00:11:36.179
this is actually going into Firefox,
grabbing this out of the downloads.

146
00:11:36.179 --> 00:11:40.081
We have to await stuff, cuz it is,
it's truly asynchronous,

147
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:41.785
it's really in a browser.

148
00:11:41.785 --> 00:11:45.481
I think you're gonna have to do something
like NPX playwright install if you've

149
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:49.359
never run playwright before, let's just,
I'm gonna run it and see what happens.

150
00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:54.169
I've done this before, so it might, yeah,
I think it's just gonna exit for me,

151
00:11:54.169 --> 00:11:57.237
for the rest of you,
it's probably gonna say like,

152
00:11:57.237 --> 00:12:02.305
do you wanna install 300 megs of stuff,
is that working for people, okay, cool.

153
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.696
That was from memory, so

154
00:12:03.696 --> 00:12:06.684
I just was worried I was
giving you the wrong command.

155
00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:10.895
What it's doing, it's gonna actually
install mini versions of Firefox,

156
00:12:10.895 --> 00:12:13.997
mini versions of Chromium and
a mini version of WebKit.

157
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.984
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so now you should
be able to run npm run test and

158
00:12:20.984 --> 00:12:25.179
it should pop up a browser or
it should fail miserably.

159
00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.188
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Fail to load config.

160
00:12:29.188 --> 00:12:32.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right, I have one
question that we maybe skipped a step

161
00:12:32.618 --> 00:12:37.598
a little bit earlier, but there was a step
to remove things from the v.config.js.

162
00:12:37.598 --> 00:12:39.075
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,
you're absolutely right.

163
00:12:39.075 --> 00:12:40.369
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I tried
messing around with that, but

164
00:12:40.369 --> 00:12:42.723
I'm still getting that error,
personally right now, so I don't.

165
00:12:42.723 --> 00:12:46.685
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, no, you're right, you
do have to delete this stuff out of your

166
00:12:46.685 --> 00:12:49.452
configure because we put
it in our vitest stuff.

167
00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:53.142
So, I had called this
vitest.config.workspace,

168
00:12:53.142 --> 00:12:56.340
which technically is
a valid thing to call it,

169
00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:00.691
but it's only for one project I
was explaining to you earlier.

170
00:13:00.691 --> 00:13:05.086
We're technically abusing a tool to
make define it for multiple projects, so

171
00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:09.694
we can take care of a browser-based
environment and a node-based environment.

172
00:13:09.694 --> 00:13:13.615
And in the docs, they recognize like,
we already have that for workspaces, so

173
00:13:13.615 --> 00:13:14.841
we're doing it that way.

174
00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:21.283
But the big thing here is make
sure it's vitest.workspace.js,

175
00:13:21.283 --> 00:13:24.741
and that'll fix our problem here.

176
00:13:27.026 --> 00:13:30.537
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's kinda silly to me
that that's not the same thing, but

177
00:13:30.537 --> 00:13:34.483
I don't know, I'm not the one
writing the open source software.

178
00:13:34.483 --> 00:13:38.112
All right, so you do all this,
and notice that I'm popped up,

179
00:13:38.112 --> 00:13:40.647
I have another window here from Nightly,
so

180
00:13:40.647 --> 00:13:44.572
this is actually downloading
Firefox Nightly to run this, right?

181
00:13:44.572 --> 00:13:46.194
That's why it's called Nightly.

182
00:13:46.194 --> 00:13:51.018
I have an error here in my test,
but let's go figure out what's

183
00:13:51.018 --> 00:13:55.583
going on with that,
failed to resolve report src/pizza.

184
00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:59.058
So I'm in pizza.browser.test.jsx,

185
00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:04.317
pizza from src/pizza,
it seems like that should be correct,

186
00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:08.602
so yes, that dot slash,
that was no source there.

187
00:14:08.602 --> 00:14:14.059
And now we have a test running in our
browser, which is kind of cool, right?

188
00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:19.558
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
this should be able to refresh and

189
00:14:19.558 --> 00:14:22.848
notice this should feel familiar,
right, the same UI, right?

190
00:14:22.848 --> 00:14:26.582
But there's actually something
kind of cool about this,

191
00:14:26.582 --> 00:14:31.610
if you come into your browser tests,
I will say that this breaks constantly and

192
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:36.658
it's like, it will freeze, and so
it's just a good refresh usually does it.

193
00:14:36.658 --> 00:14:37.896
Yeah, so stuff like this, so

194
00:14:37.896 --> 00:14:40.526
you can actually see the component
being rendered on the page,

195
00:14:40.526 --> 00:14:43.565
you're gonna include the CSS and
all stuff and make it look really nice.

196
00:14:43.565 --> 00:14:48.935
We're not doing that stuff, and I'm not
super worried about it at the moment,

197
00:14:48.935 --> 00:14:52.301
that's too bad that the image
is not working, but

198
00:14:52.301 --> 00:14:54.806
the image should work there as well.

199
00:14:54.806 --> 00:15:00.615
Pizza.jsx, did I misspell it?

200
00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:10.968
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Photos, picsum.photos.

201
00:15:13.209 --> 00:15:16.729
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then now if we go
back to our UI here, or this one,

202
00:15:16.729 --> 00:15:21.698
yeah, and then you can see that it
actually renders out the image as well.

203
00:15:21.698 --> 00:15:25.023
Kinda ends up being like a little bit of
a storybook, kinda thing where you can

204
00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:28.606
kinda like show off all of your components
in an individual kind of way using tests,

205
00:15:28.606 --> 00:15:29.857
which is kinda cool as well.
