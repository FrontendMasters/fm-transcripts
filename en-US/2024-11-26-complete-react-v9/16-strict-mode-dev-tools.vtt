WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.448
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So this is just kind of a
brief overview on some helper things that

2
00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:06.530
you can do with React just to kind
of make it easier to work with.

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.640
So one of them is, we're using vite.

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.460
So vite will take care of NODE_ENV for
you automatically.

5
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.334
But NODE_ENV,
if you're not familiar with it,

6
00:00:15.334 --> 00:00:17.967
it's just basically telling the tools
that you're working with is,

7
00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:20.215
am I in development mode,
or am I in production mode?

8
00:00:20.215 --> 00:00:22.757
And usually it's assumed that
you're in production mode, and

9
00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:25.875
then you only set it to development mode
when you're actually doing dev work.

10
00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:29.136
This used to be a thing that you
had to set it explicitly, and

11
00:00:29.136 --> 00:00:30.385
that's why I still mention it here.

12
00:00:30.385 --> 00:00:32.023
So, if you're doing Webpack,

13
00:00:32.023 --> 00:00:36.545
you might still have to set it
explicitly of I'm in dev mode right now.

14
00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:40.370
This is important to React because
React has a lot of helpers and

15
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.862
better error messages and all that
kind of stuff when you're in dev mode.

16
00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:50.164
But the actual executable of React is
a lot slower and it's four times bigger.

17
00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:54.102
Or at least that's what it was, I haven't
checked recently how big it is, but

18
00:00:54.102 --> 00:00:55.009
it was quite big.

19
00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:00.199
So if you're using Vite, if you're following along with me,
if you're using Next,

20
00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.980
if you're using Remix, they all set
NODE_ENV for you automatically.

21
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.074
If you're using something
like Webpack directly,

22
00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:07.460
you might have to set it yourself.

23
00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:12.836
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One of the reasons I bring
this up is that make sure this gets set to

24
00:01:12.836 --> 00:01:17.749
production, when you actually do go out
to production, that becomes important.

25
00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:22.257
Famously Slack shipped, React in
dev mode for a very, very long time and

26
00:01:22.257 --> 00:01:26.004
they actually saw a massive
increase in performance in Slack.

27
00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:29.944
Because all they had to do was switch
NODE_ENV to production, right?

28
00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:34.492
Which is a very dumb reason to waste a lot
of people's time and resources, right?

29
00:01:34.492 --> 00:01:41.402
So that's one. Strict mode,
let's go do that, right now.

30
00:01:43.238 --> 00:01:50.363
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So strict mode is a kind
of react mode you can set things in.

31
00:01:50.363 --> 00:01:55.462
So we're just gonna go to app.jsx,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

32
00:01:55.462 --> 00:02:02.688
we're gonna say at the top
import StrictMode

33
00:02:02.688 --> 00:02:10.291
from React, and we're just gonna wrap
our entire app in it. Strict mode.

34
00:02:13.976 --> 00:02:15.220
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So what is strict mode?

35
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.855
It's just like an extra set of checks that
React will do things for you normally.

36
00:02:20.855 --> 00:02:25.693
But in strict mode it'll say hey,
you're executing in strict mode,

37
00:02:25.693 --> 00:02:27.994
I'm not going to let you do this.

38
00:02:27.994 --> 00:02:32.372
Usually what it is, is if you're using
things that are about to be removed

39
00:02:32.372 --> 00:02:34.995
from React, it'll give you a big warning.

40
00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:35.939
It's like, hey,

41
00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.045
this has been warned that this is gonna be
removed from a future version of React.

42
00:02:40.045 --> 00:02:42.883
Am not going to let you use this
because you're in strict mode.

43
00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:43.683
So they do that so

44
00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:47.353
that people know in advance that
stuff's gonna be removed from React.

45
00:02:47.353 --> 00:02:49.083
So that's what strict mode is.

46
00:02:50.263 --> 00:02:52.423
Yeah, continually to double renders
your components, just to

47
00:02:52.423 --> 00:02:54.303
make sure that all the effects
are run twice, right?

48
00:02:56.183 --> 00:02:57.179
It can catch subtle bugs,

49
00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:59.807
of sometimes you have effects that
are doing something one time, and

50
00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:03.134
working differently another time, that's
kind of what they're supposed to catch.

51
00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:07.295
If you're asking me, how many times
has that caught something for me?

52
00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:12.919
The answer is not really, cuz once
you're in the mindset of how effects and

53
00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:19.001
state is supposed to work, it's pretty
rare that you would get outside of that.

54
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:22.734
Last thing here,
we're going to install the DevTools.

55
00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:27.322
So I have a link down here for you, this
should take you to the React docs, and

56
00:03:27.322 --> 00:03:32.154
they have dev tools available for
Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

57
00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:35.365
They used to have it for Safari, but

58
00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:39.864
I guess no one uses Safari,
so they took it away.

59
00:03:39.864 --> 00:03:45.040
No one uses Firefox, but
I'm happy they still maintain that one.

60
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.770
So yeah, let me go show you Firefox.

61
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.758
So you should just be able to click in
here and say add, I've already installed

62
00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:54.310
it so mine's gonna stay there,
it's the same thing with Chrome.

63
00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.731
And then what's cool about this,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let

64
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:04.579
me make my devtools a little bit smaller.

65
00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.872
You should see down here at the end,
components and profiler.

66
00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.757
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you get two little
things that you get added by the React dev

67
00:04:15.757 --> 00:04:16.273
tools.

68
00:04:16.273 --> 00:04:19.442
And so let's just go look at Components.

69
00:04:19.442 --> 00:04:24.380
You can see here I have an App component,
Order, Pizza, this is kind of

70
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.349
the expected order of components
that we have inside of our app here.

71
00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.175
If I click on Order,
I can also see all the hooks that happen,

72
00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:33.629
which is pretty cool, right?

73
00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:38.399
I can see everything coming in from,
these are the pizza types, right?

74
00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:42.717
You can see I have a pepperoni, medium.

75
00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:47.397
Here's something kind of fun you can do,
you can actually edit this directly.

76
00:04:47.397 --> 00:04:53.460
So if I hit this to I think it's something
like that, I break it, that's cool.

77
00:04:57.678 --> 00:04:58.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: There we go.

78
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.627
All right, so notice,
this is barbecue chicken.

79
00:05:00.627 --> 00:05:03.294
I can actually edit this
directly to be pepperoni.

80
00:05:03.294 --> 00:05:07.596
And notice when I hit Enter,
this is gonna become pepperoni, right?

81
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:11.985
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Sometimes
that can be useful, right?

82
00:05:11.985 --> 00:05:14.234
I can edit this to be small.

83
00:05:14.234 --> 00:05:18.051
It can be useful for
debugging just to see,

84
00:05:18.051 --> 00:05:21.876
if I change this to be this, what happens?

85
00:05:24.105 --> 00:05:27.518
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah again, here, you can
see all the props that come into this one.

86
00:05:27.518 --> 00:05:34.038
It does let you edit props, that used
to not be true, how cool is that?

87
00:05:40.646 --> 00:05:42.938
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's that.

88
00:05:42.938 --> 00:05:46.036
I'll show you one other trick
that I find pretty useful.

89
00:05:46.036 --> 00:05:51.354
All right, so, let's say I wanna
investigate this radio buttons,

90
00:05:51.354 --> 00:05:54.024
I can click Inspect here, right?

91
00:05:54.024 --> 00:05:55.804
So I click Inspect.

92
00:05:55.804 --> 00:05:59.638
Obviously that takes me into
the inspector, it doesn't take me

93
00:05:59.638 --> 00:06:03.763
into the React dev tools, but
if I just go over to the React dev tools.

94
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.258
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Usually it'll take you
directly to that that component, but

95
00:06:10.258 --> 00:06:15.858
it's probably because it's in the
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Larger component.

96
00:06:15.858 --> 00:06:20.698
Yeah, this time it did, okay so that time
it took me over to the pizza, right?

97
00:06:20.698 --> 00:06:22.606
Right now we only have three components.

98
00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:27.188
By the end of this course, we'll probably
have 50-ish, just because it'll introduce

99
00:06:27.188 --> 00:06:29.879
things like the router that
have a lot of layers to it.

100
00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:34.711
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That can
be super useful for

101
00:06:34.711 --> 00:06:37.816
finding a component
deeply buried in a tree.

102
00:06:37.816 --> 00:06:43.898
The last thing that I'll show you is that
we have that and now I can hit $ + R.

103
00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:52.136
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is the component that
I have selected in the React components,

104
00:06:52.136 --> 00:06:52.866
right?

105
00:06:52.866 --> 00:06:57.444
So you can see this is
actually the pepperoni pizza,

106
00:06:57.444 --> 00:07:03.073
it's the last thing that I selected
in the component tree here.

107
00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:07.330
Which is more of a party trick than
it is useful to be honest with you.

108
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.512
I don't find myself wanting
to programmatically interact

109
00:07:11.512 --> 00:07:15.619
with it very much, but
it is there, which is pretty cool.

110
00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:18.339
This is totally unrelated to React, but

111
00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:21.862
I don't know if you click on this and
you hit $ + 0.

112
00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:25.573
You'll get the last thing you
selected in the inspector,

113
00:07:25.573 --> 00:07:28.235
I find myself doing that quite a bit more.

114
00:07:32.692 --> 00:07:36.225
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I introduce those now to
just so that for the rest of the course,

115
00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:40.613
if you have any questions or concerns,
you can reference them, kind of as we go.

116
00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:46.733
There is the profiler as well,
we're gonna talk less about that,

117
00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:52.981
but let's say if I just start recording
and do a bunch of stuff here.

118
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:55.482
Sorry, don't do that right now.

119
00:07:57.923 --> 00:08:05.305
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right so
blah blah and I click Stop.

120
00:08:07.323 --> 00:08:09.446
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Our flame graph
isn't super interesting right now,

121
00:08:09.446 --> 00:08:10.588
neither is the ranked view.

122
00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:13.772
But this is gonna show you kind of the
performance profile with the flame graph.

123
00:08:13.772 --> 00:08:18.447
If you have a big React app, and
you wanna see what is going slow and

124
00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:24.335
what's broken down, this is designed to
help you with that, specific to React.

125
00:08:27.184 --> 00:08:29.973
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: These are kinda cool,
I hadn't seen these before.

126
00:08:29.973 --> 00:08:32.589
So the way that React works
is it has commits, right?

127
00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:36.059
So they're basically packets
of things that have changed.

128
00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.733
You can see what caused the update,
how long it took, what the priority was.

129
00:08:40.733 --> 00:08:43.293
Cuz you can have deferred and
immediate updates.

130
00:08:43.293 --> 00:08:45.073
There's all sorts of fun stuff you can do.

131
00:08:45.073 --> 00:08:48.923
We're not talking about performance so
much in this particular course.

132
00:08:48.923 --> 00:08:51.166
We might touch on that
more in intermediate or

133
00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:53.591
maybe in a different
React performance course.

134
00:08:55.849 --> 00:08:59.992
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: One thing,
just kind of as a general note with React,

135
00:08:59.992 --> 00:09:02.397
it's generally fast enough.

136
00:09:02.397 --> 00:09:04.935
And when I say that,
you kind of get to write React and

137
00:09:04.935 --> 00:09:07.881
be fairly naive in terms of not
worrying about performance,

138
00:09:07.881 --> 00:09:11.737
not worrying about commits or
updates or anything like that.

139
00:09:11.737 --> 00:09:15.907
My advice to you is just continue writing
React that way for the most part.

140
00:09:15.907 --> 00:09:19.337
Only introduce the performance
enhancements when you have a problem.

141
00:09:19.337 --> 00:09:21.326
So, stated differently
solve problems you have,

142
00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:23.606
don't try to anticipate
problems that you might have,

143
00:09:23.606 --> 00:09:26.775
because you usually are wrong about
what the problems you're about to have.

144
00:09:30.585 --> 00:09:34.782
And while the performance enhancements for
React work,

145
00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:40.035
they work great, they make the code
harder to read and harder to debug.

146
00:09:41.566 --> 00:09:45.757
And that's why I say don't do the performance
enhancements until you need them,

147
00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:48.437
because it becomes harder
to work with your code.
