1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.075
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's do form actions.

2
00:00:06.028 --> 00:00:10.740
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're actually going to go implement this.

3
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.841
So, this is a future disclaimer
to people watching this course.

4
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.623
If you're watching today with me,
just follow along with me.

5
00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:20.466
But if you're watching the course,

6
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:24.336
I need you to do something to make sure
that you get the right version of React.

7
00:00:24.336 --> 00:00:28.261
So go to wherever your server
is running or your testing.

8
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.170
I'm gonna cancel my testing here.

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.676
And I need you to do npm info react, and

10
00:00:33.676 --> 00:00:39.055
you'll see here what the tag is for,
what the current is.

11
00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:44.770
You can see the current
as of today is 18.13.1.

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.140
If this says 19, then just do npm
install react@19 and you are good to go.

13
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.030
So npm install react@19,
and react-dom@19 and

14
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.046
you should be good to go here, right?

15
00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:04.696
If you're following and
it does not say that,

16
00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:08.822
it says 18 still,
just take a look down here at rc.

17
00:01:08.822 --> 00:01:11.681
And so mine is here,
you can see mine's 19.0.

18
00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:13.551
So that's what I'm gonna do today.

19
00:01:13.551 --> 00:01:19.669
So I'm gonna do npm install react@rc and
react-dom@rc.

20
00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:28.583
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you might even
have to force it or did mine go okay?

21
00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:33.266
It gives you a ton of warnings
because react query a bunch of

22
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:37.767
these things are like,
I only support react 18.

23
00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:41.683
They take a lot of care to not break
stuff, so our stuff should work,

24
00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:45.946
but just be aware that you're into kind
of dangerous waters now by being on

25
00:01:45.946 --> 00:01:48.930
a release candidate instead
of something stable.

26
00:01:52.406 --> 00:01:54.630
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so
just be extra cautious here, or

27
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.524
if you don't wanna mess with it,
just feel free to follow along with me.

28
00:01:58.524 --> 00:02:05.473
So most of web development, in my opinion,
is a form, or revolves around a form.

29
00:02:05.473 --> 00:02:07.354
It's mostly just taking user data and

30
00:02:07.354 --> 00:02:10.009
doing something within kind
of being reactive to it.

31
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.999
Or, in other words,

32
00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.250
you really can't get away from doing
a lot of forms as a web developer.

33
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.853
So the React team kinda took that
to heart, and they're like, okay,

34
00:02:18.853 --> 00:02:21.988
let's make forms extra
easy with react-dom.

35
00:02:21.988 --> 00:02:27.797
So, let's just make our
mutation function inside

36
00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:33.077
of contact.lazy.jsx a little bit simpler.

37
00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:40.069
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So right now, we have to
do this stuff with prevent default and

38
00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.623
create the form data, and
then we can do all this kinda stuff.

39
00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:46.431
But let's make this a little bit simpler.

40
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:49.581
Go to your form down here,

41
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:54.307
where I have this onSubmit function and

42
00:02:54.307 --> 00:02:58.327
you wanna change this to action.

43
00:03:02.922 --> 00:03:03.991
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

44
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.731
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then this is gonna do
all of this funny stuff here for you.

45
00:03:10.731 --> 00:03:15.605
So you can just delete these top two
lines and turn this "e" into formData.

46
00:03:19.847 --> 00:03:20.476
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: No, I'm just kidding.

47
00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:22.823
Obviously, it's a pretty simple thing.

48
00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:25.257
But it's just a nice little nicety.

49
00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:30.808
However, we're doing this inside of
React query, so we wouldn't do this.

50
00:03:30.808 --> 00:03:32.501
But then you get into a function body and

51
00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:34.721
you can start doing things
like "use server" in here.

52
00:03:34.721 --> 00:03:39.585
And then you can just kind of implicitly
handle all the data on the server,

53
00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:43.665
and that ends up being a really
nice interface to accept data,

54
00:03:43.665 --> 00:03:48.153
send to the server, the server
then saves to the database, right?

55
00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:54.877
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's really quite it.

56
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.072
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, that's it for contact.

57
00:04:03.072 --> 00:04:07.181
Let's go do this for order as well.

58
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:08.993
So this is a form as well.

59
00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:14.206
So we're gonna go down to our form and
have all this stuff here.

60
00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:19.429
I think we really only need to
grab the setCart out of here.

61
00:04:19.429 --> 00:04:21.320
So I'm just gonna grab that and

62
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.773
I'm gonna make another function
here called function addToCart().

63
00:04:28.346 --> 00:04:30.988
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Put that setCart in here,
and

64
00:04:30.988 --> 00:04:36.068
then this is just gonna
be action={addToCart()}.

65
00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:42.149
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,
it just got a little simpler, right?

66
00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:47.648
A little bit easier to read,
reads a little bit better,

67
00:04:47.648 --> 00:04:50.812
so yeah, I'm a big fan of this.

68
00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:55.080
Yeah, and
to give you a better example of this,

69
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.366
imagine I came in here and
I had done "use server".

70
00:04:59.366 --> 00:05:05.932
And now I can do something like
sql INSERT INTO cart, blah, blah,

71
00:05:05.932 --> 00:05:13.214
blah, and do all of my stuff on the server
that inserts into the database.

72
00:05:13.214 --> 00:05:15.894
I remember when next, kind of first
started talking about this, and

73
00:05:15.894 --> 00:05:18.678
people started raging, is like,
why are you doing SQL in the browser?

74
00:05:18.678 --> 00:05:20.778
I was like, we're not, right?

75
00:05:20.778 --> 00:05:23.077
It's okay,
this is all happening on the server.

76
00:05:23.077 --> 00:05:27.489
But seeing React components together with
SQL really just set some people off.

77
00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:30.976
It's not just, like, making this
a little bit simpler to read,

78
00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:35.379
they also do some other stuff that make it
a little bit easier to work with as well.

79
00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:36.764
So I'm gonna show you one of them.

80
00:05:36.764 --> 00:05:41.010
So I want you to head over to contact and

81
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.872
we're gonna import at the top here.

82
00:05:46.648 --> 00:05:50.884
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: { useFormStatus }
from 'react-dom', not React,

83
00:05:50.884 --> 00:05:55.208
make sure that you're putting
the dash dom there because

84
00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:59.100
this is gonna... Forms are particular to the DOM,
right?

85
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.034
They're not necessarily gonna be in
React Native, or React-three, or

86
00:06:02.034 --> 00:06:02.944
something like that.

87
00:06:02.944 --> 00:06:05.420
So that's why this comes from react-dom.

88
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:10.848
And what's cool about this is
we have some sort of child

89
00:06:10.848 --> 00:06:15.930
component here like this
function ContactInput.

90
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.600
And we're gonna say return just input.

91
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.352
This is kind of a contrived example,
but you could see.

92
00:06:23.352 --> 00:06:28.069
Imagine you have a input that's
a part of your design system and

93
00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.676
has a bunch of CSS around it and
has complex errors and complex validation,

94
00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:38.320
you would have some sort of
component that does this, right?

95
00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:44.216
Using form status, we can actually check
to see if the form submitting is pending,

96
00:06:44.216 --> 00:06:46.585
which is useful, or submitted.

97
00:06:46.585 --> 00:06:51.366
So we're gonna say disabled={pending}, and

98
00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:55.020
we'll get that from our form status.

99
00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.594
We have name={props.name}.

100
00:07:00.594 --> 00:07:03.262
Let's get props coming in here as well.

101
00:07:03.262 --> 00:07:07.790
Type={props.type} and

102
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:14.773
placeholder={props.placeholder}.

103
00:07:19.374 --> 00:07:23.874
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and now we
would need this pending thing, and

104
00:07:23.874 --> 00:07:30.455
it's really cool all we have to do is
say const {pending} = useFormStatus().

105
00:07:30.455 --> 00:07:34.419
It doesn't have to have any really
concept of where the form is coming from.

106
00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:36.941
It can be super buried component,
component,

107
00:07:36.941 --> 00:07:40.165
component way down in there
because React knows where it is.

108
00:07:40.165 --> 00:07:44.809
It's gonna say, you're in a form and
this form is pending,

109
00:07:44.809 --> 00:07:46.929
so you are disabled, right?

110
00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:48.991
And now we just have to put this up here.

111
00:07:48.991 --> 00:07:54.138
I think you can literally just change this

112
00:07:54.138 --> 00:07:59.294
to be ContactInput and type="text".

113
00:07:59.294 --> 00:08:04.101
And this one I think I can just
literally just say ContactInput,

114
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:05.709
and it's good to go.

115
00:08:05.709 --> 00:08:08.096
This will work, right?

116
00:08:08.096 --> 00:08:12.530
Cuz now whenever I submit this form,
imagine this takes a long time,

117
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.667
we don't want people to be typing
in there while it's pending.

118
00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:19.462
Anyway, suffice to say,
this still makes sense and

119
00:08:19.462 --> 00:08:21.886
it's still kinda cool
that useFormStatus.

120
00:08:21.886 --> 00:08:22.866
You can pull that in,

121
00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:26.312
despite the fact that this has no
concept of where it's being rendered in.

122
00:08:26.312 --> 00:08:28.756
That's kinda the point of
useFormStatus.
