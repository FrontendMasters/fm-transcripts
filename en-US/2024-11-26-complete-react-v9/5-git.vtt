00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.902
Mostly I want you to do a gitignore
at this point in the course, so

2
00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:08.894
Git is obviously our source tracking for
our project,

3
00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:13.390
and mostly I just want you to
make a gitignore file for stuff.

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.402
This will really help out VS code to
be faster for just a bunch of stuff,

5
00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:21.278
because VS code relies heavily on
your gitignore being useful, and

6
00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:24.022
I just want you to like, it's good.

7
00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:27.011
All of my projects,
even if they're not making it to GitHub,

8
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:30.762
I still have a habit of committing, and
tracking, and all that kinda stuff.

9
00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:35.972
And most stuff ends up on Git, I have so
much private garbage on GitHub anyway.

10
00:00:35.972 --> 00:00:41.399
So anyway, the first thing that you always
ignore in your gitignore, especially

11
00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.489
if you're under Mac and especially if
you're not on a Mac, is DS_ Store.

12
00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.890
This shows up in so
many projects, it's hilarious,

13
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.739
it's a file that's auto-generated by
Mac OS and it's all as far as I know.

14
00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.266
So if you like,
just like drag a file here,

15
00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:03.070
it's the positioning in the Mac OS Window,
and that's why it's in DS_ Store.

16
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.890
It might be other stuff too, but anyway,

17
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.870
that's why DS_ Store
ends up in every file.

18
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.260
Node_ modules that should also be one
that you immediately ignore, right?

19
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.132
Because this is stuff that
you don't wanna check in,

20
00:01:15.132 --> 00:01:17.180
you just wanna NPM install
it every single time.

21
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.470
Do we have a dist in this?

22
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.291
I can't remember, but we'll just copy, be
what I have in here, dist, do we have dot,

23
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:27.540
I don't remember either, but .env files,
you always wanna ignore those.

24
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.000
Coverage, we will have one of those,
you can ignore the .vscode or not.

25
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.332
That's up to you, I tend to ignore it,
so the .vscode directory is like if you

26
00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:40.695
wanna make configurations specifically for
your project.

27
00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:44.567
When you when you open it, it'll generate
this .vscode directory, it's up to you,

28
00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:46.275
if you want to check that in or not.

29
00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:49.895
If you think that's useful to share
with your coworkers, then check it in.

30
00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:54.873
Sometimes it is, I can think of an example
like it's a Python project, you want

31
00:01:54.873 --> 00:01:59.135
to make sure that everyone's using Pylance
with your dot, with your project, right?

32
00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:03.934
You would have a .DScode directory
that would tell their projects,

33
00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:07.335
please install Pylands for
them right up to you.

34
00:02:10.677 --> 00:02:13.421
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yep, and
if you need more instruction on this,

35
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:16.358
Primeagen definitely has a course, right?

36
00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:17.788
Yep, everything you know about Git.

37
00:02:19.078 --> 00:02:20.369
&gt;&gt; Student: And also Nino's.

38
00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.966
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Ninas is also great too,
yeah, I hired Nina at Reddit, we have

39
00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:26.569
worked together for a long time, and then
we worked together again at Microsoft.

40
00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:33.789
The last thing we'll do is run, git init,
it might yell at you, no, it's fine.

41
00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.479
Okay, so
this will initiate an empty git project,

42
00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:44.602
even though I'm inside of my Git project,
it's kind of an onion.

43
00:02:44.602 --> 00:02:48.544
It goes to the nearest git project
in there, and you can see here,

44
00:02:48.544 --> 00:02:50.672
I have a .git directory.

45
00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:52.419
So, that's kind of up to you,

46
00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:56.272
if you wanna just track it as part
of my repo that you were in, right?

47
00:02:58.142 --> 00:03:02.758
Because I'm just in the, complete and
short of reaction, v9 projects, right?

48
00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:04.214
And I have Padre Genos in here, or

49
00:03:04.214 --> 00:03:07.023
if you want to have your own separate
this is my repo that I built,

50
00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:09.808
you can get in it in there, and
you can track it as part of that.

51
00:03:09.808 --> 00:03:11.324
That's totally up to you.
