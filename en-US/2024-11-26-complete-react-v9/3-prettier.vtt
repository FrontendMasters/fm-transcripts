00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.626
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I take a little bit
of a break from writing React, and

2
00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:06.284
we're going to talk about tools,
which seem to bother everyone but me.

3
00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:08.940
I love tools, that's why I've worked
in Dev Tools for a very long time.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.933
I've shown you enough
vanilla JavaScript React for

5
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:17.569
you to know exactly what's
happening underneath the hood.

6
00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:21.571
From here, we're going to move into JSX,
which was a huge barrier to adoption for

7
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:24.306
a lot of people,
especially early in the life of React.

8
00:00:24.306 --> 00:00:29.231
Where they're like, hey we don't
really want to write this compiled to

9
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:31.986
JavaScript language, it feels weird.

10
00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:36.609
But we'll get there in just a second, for
now we're gonna set up all the tools so

11
00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:37.784
that we can do that.

12
00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:41.818
So the first thing is we're gonna use npm,
I'm gonna use npm for

13
00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:44.805
the life of this course,
feel free to use Yarn,

14
00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:48.407
previous versions of this
course have used Yarn before.

15
00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:51.891
pnpm, you can see I have a call
out to that one as well,

16
00:00:51.891 --> 00:00:55.224
I think that's getting more and
more popular, but

17
00:00:55.224 --> 00:00:58.886
it's kind of hard to go wrong
with just straight up npm.

18
00:00:58.886 --> 00:01:03.618
If you're not familiar with npm, it does
not not stand for node package manager,

19
00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:07.610
but it kind of stands for
node package manager that's what they say.

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.553
They say it doesn't stand for that, and
then they just finish the sentence and

21
00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:12.531
don't say anything else,
it's kind of annoying.

22
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:16.723
Anyway, it is the package manager for node
js, and it allows you to install these

23
00:01:16.723 --> 00:01:20.569
things directly off of the MPM registry,
which is now owned by GitHub.

24
00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:25.189
Which is in turn by owned by Microsoft.

25
00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.594
It allows you to do things like npm run or
npm install react and things like that.

26
00:01:29.594 --> 00:01:33.555
So in our project,
let's go do the first thing here,

27
00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:38.396
you can go ahead and stop serve,
we won't be using that anymore,

28
00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.728
that's control c if you're
not familiar with the Linux.

29
00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:48.156
All right, so I'm gonna do npm init
dash y, the dash y just says I don't

30
00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:53.514
wanna answer any of your dumb questions,
just generate a file for me.

31
00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:57.081
But if you wanna answer the questions,
just leave off the dash y and

32
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.152
you'll see that you'll get
out of here a packaged JSON.

33
00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:04.390
Here, and this allows you to start
saving things to your project,

34
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.024
the reason why this is useful to us is
that we can say, npm install react.

35
00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.670
It'll go and solve React for us, and

36
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.716
it'll store the version of React
that we're using in the project.

37
00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:17.940
So that when I share this with you later,
you can go install it and you'll get

38
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.242
the same version of React or a compatible
version of React, that I'm using.

39
00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:27.410
But I don't have to save React in my repo,
so we don't have to ever have a trillion

40
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.983
copies of React floating out on GitHub
right, we get one copy of React.

41
00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:35.904
And if React has a critical vulnerability,
stuff like that happens,

42
00:02:35.904 --> 00:02:39.427
they're able to patch it so
that next time you go to install it,

43
00:02:39.427 --> 00:02:42.631
you'll get the patch version
not the insecure version.

44
00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.124
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay
hopefully that worked for

45
00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:51.872
you if not you'll probably have
to go to the node.js page.

46
00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:56.305
And install node however you
choose to do that but again and

47
00:02:56.305 --> 00:03:00.388
make sure you end up on node 20.6 or
above please.

48
00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:07.232
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Feel free to use pnpm,
it does relatively the same thing,

49
00:03:07.232 --> 00:03:10.692
I'd be very confident that it
would work just as well Yarn,

50
00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:13.824
less so these days I haven't
used Yarn in a long time.

51
00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:23.188
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You might have noticed
when I've been writing code here,

52
00:03:23.188 --> 00:03:28.938
that if I do something like this,
let's close this come on.

53
00:03:28.938 --> 00:03:34.341
So if I do like this and I put a bunch
of space and then whenever I hit save,

54
00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:40.198
Slash [INAUDIBLE] Thank you it just fixes
all my spacing for me automatically,

55
00:03:40.198 --> 00:03:44.636
I cannot be bothered to handle
spacing anymore like that.

56
00:03:44.636 --> 00:03:48.497
That process in my brain that thinks about
code formatting has just been shut down

57
00:03:48.497 --> 00:03:51.808
and at this point it's been shut down for
so long, it's attribute.

58
00:03:51.808 --> 00:03:56.701
So I literally cannot fathom how to write
well formatted code anymore because

59
00:03:56.701 --> 00:04:00.852
prettier just doesn't for
me automatically every single time.

60
00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:05.968
So, Prettier is a code formatter,
it takes in unformatted code and

61
00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:11.553
it spits out formatted code,
it's my favorite tool in JavaScript ever.

62
00:04:11.553 --> 00:04:16.371
It's literally changed
the way that I write code and

63
00:04:16.371 --> 00:04:19.445
blessed be to the Prettier gods.

64
00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:25.434
So, let's go ahead and
start this project for Prettier,

65
00:04:25.434 --> 00:04:31.180
all you have to do is create
a file called .prettierrc,

66
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.796
and then I put the very controversial
empty object as my config.

67
00:04:37.796 --> 00:04:40.191
Which is just saying use all the defaults.

68
00:04:42.938 --> 00:04:48.765
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: My least favorite thing is
a bike shedding about code formatting,

69
00:04:48.765 --> 00:04:49.708
I hate it.

70
00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:53.647
I have been in so
many meetings over the years of like,

71
00:04:53.647 --> 00:04:57.940
we should be using tabs versus spaces or
commas at the end or

72
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.126
automated semicolon insertion or
not, all those different things.

73
00:05:03.126 --> 00:05:08.066
And my message to you is I
can't fathom any caring for

74
00:05:08.066 --> 00:05:12.793
it, it's my least favorite
thing to talk about.

75
00:05:12.793 --> 00:05:16.434
So that's why I put this empty object here
is whatever someone else chooses for me,

76
00:05:16.434 --> 00:05:19.674
I don't care as long as it gets formatted
in a uniform way, I don't care.

77
00:05:19.674 --> 00:05:20.645
So that's what that is.

78
00:05:20.645 --> 00:05:24.948
I have a VS Code extension here so
if you're following along in

79
00:05:24.948 --> 00:05:29.937
VS Code I'm going to suggest you
install the Prettier code formatter.

80
00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:34.492
There's several so make sure you get the
one that's officially from Prettier and

81
00:05:34.492 --> 00:05:36.349
then go into one of your JS files.

82
00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:42.024
You can hit it's either
shift command p on a Mac or

83
00:05:42.024 --> 00:05:46.177
ctrl shift p on Linux and Windows and

84
00:05:46.177 --> 00:05:49.792
then choose Format Document.

85
00:05:49.792 --> 00:05:53.179
If this is your first time doing it,
it's gonna say,

86
00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:57.096
hey you need to choose a formatter and
just choose Prettier and

87
00:05:57.096 --> 00:06:00.808
then that'll set that up so
that formats your documents.

88
00:06:00.808 --> 00:06:05.118
And then if you hit command comma or
control comma, and

89
00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:11.129
then you wanna do format on save and
just make sure that that one's checked.

90
00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.020
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Then you're ready to roll.

91
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.806
And then you'll get exactly the same
thing, so you can just mess up formatting,

92
00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:21.704
make it terrible.

93
00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:25.121
Let's de-indent everything
because that just, it makes

94
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:29.580
everyone ill to look at that code and
you just save it and it just fixes itself.

95
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:35.780
I know I want everyone to use VS Code, but
I also used to work with the Primeagen,

96
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.797
so [LAUGH] not everyone's gonna
use VS Code, turns out, right?

97
00:06:40.797 --> 00:06:44.877
So you need to set up all of your
projects to work with anyone's tools,

98
00:06:44.877 --> 00:06:46.268
not just your own tool.

99
00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:52.196
So let's go ahead and
set up Prettier to work with everybody,

100
00:06:52.196 --> 00:06:57.441
npm install --save-dev or
if you're lazy like me,

101
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.643
npm i -D is the exact same thing.

102
00:07:00.643 --> 00:07:02.240
And we're gonna put Prettier.

103
00:07:08.374 --> 00:07:11.524
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And you can see here
we have a devDependency right, so

104
00:07:11.524 --> 00:07:15.654
this only needs to be installed in
development environments, not for

105
00:07:15.654 --> 00:07:17.342
protection environments.

106
00:07:17.342 --> 00:07:19.854
That's what the devDependency means.

107
00:07:19.854 --> 00:07:25.694
And then, under scripts,
we're going to do this,

108
00:07:25.694 --> 00:07:30.871
I'm going to set format and
you're going to do

109
00:07:30.871 --> 00:07:37.245
prettier dash--write, and
we're just going to say,

110
00:07:37.245 --> 00:07:41.797
do everything in the source directory.

111
00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:53.641
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
then you need to do js, jsx, ts, tsx,

112
00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:58.453
whatever file formats
you wanted to look at.

113
00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:03.130
That's probably a pretty good list,
we're not going to have any

114
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.892
TypeScript in this, so
you could leave the TypeScript stuff out,

115
00:08:07.892 --> 00:08:11.824
but js, jsx, css,
you could put HTML in here as well.

116
00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:16.043
Preview doesn't work with everything, but
they're actually expanding it to a lot of

117
00:08:16.043 --> 00:08:19.243
other languages now, make sure you
need a comma there at the end.

118
00:08:23.193 --> 00:08:27.095
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now we should
be able to run npm run format,

119
00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:30.006
that's what the scripts are for.

120
00:08:30.006 --> 00:08:34.581
It's basically, please remember these
bash commands for me so later so

121
00:08:34.581 --> 00:08:37.364
I don't have to remember
how to write this.

122
00:08:37.364 --> 00:08:41.056
You can just say npm run format and
it'll run that for you, and

123
00:08:41.056 --> 00:08:42.907
I needed a closing quote here.

124
00:08:42.907 --> 00:08:47.816
Make sure you have the quotes here,
the backslash is just an escape character,

125
00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:48.337
right?

126
00:08:48.337 --> 00:08:51.427
The reason why you want the quotes here
is that you don't want your shell to do

127
00:08:51.427 --> 00:08:52.306
the file expansion.

128
00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:57.108
You want the actual, you want that passed
in literally as a string to Prettier so

129
00:08:57.108 --> 00:09:00.347
that it can go do all the finding
of the correct files.

130
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.148
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now, mine's already running
right, because every time I save the file,

131
00:09:06.148 --> 00:09:08.720
it's running, but you can see so
it says unchanged here, but

132
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.816
if I had something to change there,
it would say.
