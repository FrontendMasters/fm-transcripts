WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.292
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's make
another component up here.

2
00:00:01.292 --> 00:00:02.885
We're gonna call it pizza.

3
00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:12.910
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
this is gonna be another component,

4
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.579
and we're gonna say, return.

5
00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.637
Yeah, we have to do
react.createElement.return.

6
00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:24.899
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This can be a div.

7
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.310
It's gonna be empty object here.

8
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.157
We're gonna give it an array just for
fun because we

9
00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:37.241
want to return multiple top
level React components.

10
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:39.755
And that's how you do it,
you do it with an array.

11
00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:45.693
React.createElement("h1", {}),

12
00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:51.634
and this is gonna be the pepperoni pizza.

13
00:00:51.634 --> 00:00:55.018
Feel free to put in
here whatever you want,

14
00:00:55.018 --> 00:00:58.026
if you like a pineapple on your pizza.

15
00:00:58.026 --> 00:00:58.675
No judgment here.

16
00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.589
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right, so
we've now made this pizza component.

17
00:01:07.589 --> 00:01:08.911
You see this is returning an array.

18
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:14.665
This is the way that you return two
siblings as a top-level component here.

19
00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:17.740
The other way that this could work,

20
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.171
you can actually delete this and
have it just to be like multiple

21
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:27.798
parameters to the React.createElement
function.

22
00:01:27.798 --> 00:01:32.800
Honestly, it doesn't really matter
because once we start getting into JSX,

23
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.162
it's irrelevant of how it happens.

24
00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:39.323
But just so under the hood,
JSX will convert this to an array,

25
00:01:39.323 --> 00:01:43.646
which occasionally can be useful or
it's at least good to know or

26
00:01:43.646 --> 00:01:45.668
irrelevant, I don't know.

27
00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.384
You might forget it and who cares?

28
00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:51.692
Anyway, an array, so
now we have this array and

29
00:01:51.692 --> 00:01:57.211
we want to render a bunch of
pizzas inside of our app, right?

30
00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:03.103
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're also gonna turn this into an array.

31
00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:06.967
I'm gonna move this createElement
inside of it as the first thing.

32
00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:12.637
And then I'm just gonna
create a bunch of pizzas,

33
00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:17.100
React.createElement(Pizza), okay?

34
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.804
And I'm just gonna make a couple of those.

35
00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.046
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So something you might
be gathering here, if it's a string,

36
00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:35.809
it's going to literally output that string
to the DOM as like a DOM node, right?

37
00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:41.328
And if it's a function or
a React component of some variety, right?

38
00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:44.878
It's going to try and
render that function.

39
00:02:44.878 --> 00:02:47.295
But the cool thing about React is you
kind of get to treat them the same.

40
00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:53.312
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Now you
might be asking well,

41
00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:57.643
what happened to this stuff, right?

42
00:02:57.643 --> 00:02:58.699
You can put it in there.

43
00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.983
So this will pass down
properties into pizza.

44
00:03:00.983 --> 00:03:02.793
And we'll talk about
that in just a second.

45
00:03:02.793 --> 00:03:05.555
And you can give pizza
children elements as well,

46
00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:07.606
which we'll also talk about later.

47
00:03:07.606 --> 00:03:09.791
But just so it's the same function.

48
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:13.503
It works exactly the same way because we
have nothing to give it as children

49
00:03:13.503 --> 00:03:15.538
because we have no properties to give it.

50
00:03:15.538 --> 00:03:19.756
We can just omit all of it,
which is what we're doing here, okay?

51
00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:25.430
So again, my favorite thing to do,
what do we expect to happen here?

52
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.205
And I like to work at the top of the tree,
which is app, and then work my way down.

53
00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:32.422
All right, so
we're gonna render into route app.

54
00:03:32.422 --> 00:03:36.436
So we're gonna render this,
then we're gonna have a div, and

55
00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:40.450
inside of that div,
we're gonna have an h1 with Padre Ginos,

56
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.118
which is what we had before,
but then we have pizza here.

57
00:03:44.118 --> 00:03:49.140
Okay, so this is gonna go into pizza and
it's gonna render an h1

58
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.010
with pepperoni pizza and a p with
mozzarella cheese and pepperoni, okay?

59
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.685
It does it once and
then it's gonna do it again.

60
00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:05.002
Another h1, another p, and it does so
five different times, right?

61
00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:07.325
So far, so good makes sense?

62
00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:09.574
So how many h1s do you expect?

63
00:04:09.574 --> 00:04:12.050
It's kind of mildly a trick question.

64
00:04:16.083 --> 00:04:17.440
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Six, right?

65
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.733
Cuz you're gonna have five from the pizza
and then one from Padre Gino's, right?

66
00:04:20.733 --> 00:04:23.162
That's why it says
mildly a trick question.

67
00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.748
And then how many p's do you expect?

68
00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:29.311
Five, all right, let's take a look.

69
00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:38.210
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A lot of pepperoni pizza.

70
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.189
Pretty cool though, right?

71
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.994
You might get React yelling at you.

72
00:04:42.994 --> 00:04:43.868
Is this about keys?

73
00:04:43.868 --> 00:04:46.491
Yeah, just go ahead and
straight up ignore React.

74
00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:49.165
Doesn't know what it's talking about.

75
00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:50.929
Well, [LAUGH] talk about that.

76
00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:53.147
But for now, just ignore React.

77
00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:54.336
What you're doing is fine.

78
00:04:54.336 --> 00:04:56.998
Now I want to have
multiple types of Pizza.

79
00:04:56.998 --> 00:04:58.867
I am a connoisseur of pizza.

80
00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:02.185
You might call me, you might not.

81
00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:03.745
So how do we do that?

82
00:05:03.745 --> 00:05:08.353
What's cool is pizza can accept
what these things called props,

83
00:05:08.353 --> 00:05:12.135
stands for properties,
in case you're wondering.

84
00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:13.919
It probably was illuminating to no one.

85
00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.611
You probably got that right away.

86
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:21.240
That's fine, it made me feel smart to say
it, and we're gonna say here on props,

87
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.845
we can pull things off of it
that we pass down into it.

88
00:05:24.845 --> 00:05:28.323
So we wanna give it whatever
the name of the pizza is, and

89
00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:31.143
then we wanna give it a description,
right?

90
00:05:31.143 --> 00:05:34.745
So we're gonna say props.,
did I call it description? I did.

91
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.897
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So cool,
now it's a bit more flexible.

92
00:05:39.897 --> 00:05:42.183
It can accept a name,
it can accept a description.

93
00:05:42.183 --> 00:05:47.284
Let's go ahead and
add these to our pizzas.

94
00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:52.124
So this is where this object
is gonna come in handy.

95
00:05:52.124 --> 00:05:55.108
Now we can come in here and say object and

96
00:05:55.108 --> 00:05:58.640
we're gonna give it a name and
we'll give it.

97
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.848
But this one can be the pepperoni
pizza and the description can be,

98
00:06:03.848 --> 00:06:07.475
I have like nice looking
descriptions here and

99
00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:12.036
I'm not gonna do that cause I
don't wanna type that much.

100
00:06:12.036 --> 00:06:15.188
So some dope pizza, right?

101
00:06:15.188 --> 00:06:15.737
Something like that.

102
00:06:15.737 --> 00:06:16.497
Whatever you wanna put there.

103
00:06:16.497 --> 00:06:22.814
I'm not your mom. Name,
we're gonna put the Americano

104
00:06:22.814 --> 00:06:27.909
in here because I was
just talking about it.

105
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:30.817
And I want you to sit there and
think about French fries on your pizza.

106
00:06:30.817 --> 00:06:33.549
That's really what I want from this.

107
00:06:33.549 --> 00:06:38.958
French fries and hot dogs.

108
00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:40.793
What the WTF Italy.

109
00:06:40.793 --> 00:06:44.753
All right, there we go.

110
00:06:44.753 --> 00:06:47.292
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Name,
just to continue with the theme,

111
00:06:47.292 --> 00:06:49.464
we'll do the Hawaiian here next.

112
00:06:51.874 --> 00:06:56.570
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Description, pineapple and

113
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.769
ham, WTF America.

114
00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.968
All right, there we go.

115
00:07:04.053 --> 00:07:09.301
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And now we have
the world's worst pizza menu [LAUGH].

116
00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:15.256
All right, outside of indicting many
cultures with their pizza attitudes,

117
00:07:15.256 --> 00:07:19.012
what is interesting and
useful here, is now,

118
00:07:19.012 --> 00:07:23.795
this pizza component,
became far more useful to us, right?

119
00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:25.115
We get to create this,

120
00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:29.703
like encapsulated bit of logic that
handles everything about having a pizza.

121
00:07:29.703 --> 00:07:34.263
So if you imagine working with our
Padre Geno's website that we're about to

122
00:07:34.263 --> 00:07:34.903
go build,

123
00:07:34.903 --> 00:07:39.981
you imagine that we have to display Pizza
in various different parts of the website.

124
00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:42.929
On the pizza of the day,
we have to show it.

125
00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:45.217
On the orders page, we have to show it.

126
00:07:45.217 --> 00:07:48.107
On the past orders page,
we have to show it.

127
00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:52.295
And now we just get like one
pizza component that we just,

128
00:07:52.295 --> 00:07:57.530
if you give it the right information,
it's going to display nicely and

129
00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:01.566
encapsulate all the logic for
making a pizza, right?

130
00:08:01.566 --> 00:08:04.249
It's kind of interesting to look
at the history of React and

131
00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:05.439
why it's built this way.

132
00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:10.820
When React was created,
the really big things on the market

133
00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:17.167
were model view controllers or
model view view models of frameworks,

134
00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:21.699
which was like backbone
an old Angular knockout.

135
00:08:21.699 --> 00:08:24.935
They all had these kind of like they were
copying basically what Rails was doing on

136
00:08:24.935 --> 00:08:27.761
the back end, and they were trying
to ship that logic to the front end.

137
00:08:27.761 --> 00:08:30.677
I wrote lots of it,
pretty good code bases.

138
00:08:30.677 --> 00:08:35.953
I mean, I'm not actually gonna
really talk down too much to it,

139
00:08:35.953 --> 00:08:39.471
but React kinda had this epiphany is like,

140
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:44.770
it's actually really easy to
write websites with PHP, right?

141
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.314
The page model really
appealed to them were like,

142
00:08:47.314 --> 00:08:50.958
you have everything kind of mashed
together for small things, right?

143
00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:54.345
So instead of trying to separate, here's
my model that talks to the database,

144
00:08:54.345 --> 00:08:56.123
here's my view of what people look at it.

145
00:08:56.123 --> 00:08:59.044
And here's the view model
which connects the two things,

146
00:08:59.044 --> 00:09:03.227
they were let's take the model, the view
and the view model and shove it together.

147
00:09:03.227 --> 00:09:08.669
So you have these components that contain
everything for very small pieces of code.

148
00:09:08.669 --> 00:09:12.803
That was kind of the PHP way
unintentionally at the time, but

149
00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:15.896
I'll say that my first
job was I was a PHP dev.

150
00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:17.667
I was very productive, right?

151
00:09:17.667 --> 00:09:21.099
I shipped a lot of code very quickly,
so that is the story of React of how we

152
00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:25.042
got this idea of like, we're gonna take
everything for these small components and

153
00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:26.868
we're going to shove them together.

154
00:09:26.868 --> 00:09:31.853
So that you have everything for
one concern in one place.

155
00:09:31.853 --> 00:09:33.251
And it turns out for

156
00:09:33.251 --> 00:09:38.503
UIs that's extremely useful because
now we can have this Pizza logic.

157
00:09:38.503 --> 00:09:41.051
And instead of having to
connect everything together,

158
00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:43.990
we have to connect the view model
to all these different places.

159
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.127
We just say, here's a pizza, and all the
logic for pizza is contained in one space.

160
00:09:48.127 --> 00:09:52.148
It's great I obviously have been doing
it for a decade, so I stuck with it.

161
00:09:52.148 --> 00:09:53.876
So it's a really nice way
of writing interfaces.

162
00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:57.350
You'll see this like little
checkered flag here,

163
00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:02.373
if you click this should take you to
the directory that we were in, right?

164
00:10:02.373 --> 00:10:05.372
So this is the no frills React one.

165
00:10:05.372 --> 00:10:06.466
You'll click in there.

166
00:10:06.466 --> 00:10:09.521
You'll see that we have our app.js.

167
00:10:09.521 --> 00:10:17.043
This is a much more culturally sensitive
version of what we were writing.

168
00:10:17.043 --> 00:10:20.774
Yeah, so if you got stuck, feel free
to go grab this code or take a look.

169
00:10:20.774 --> 00:10:24.142
And you can diff between the two and
say what's different, what worked,

170
00:10:24.142 --> 00:10:28.015
what didn't work, and just look for those
checkered flags throughout the course.
