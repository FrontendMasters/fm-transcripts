00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.610
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
let's talk about key really quick.

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.240
Key is here, it seems kind of strange.

3
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.970
Let's just delete it here for a second.

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.760
Is this actually, yeah.

5
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.490
Good for you, react, for
remembering to tell me that.

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.790
But it's gonna yell at you
here in the console as well.

7
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.330
It says that each thing should
have a unique key prop.

8
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.965
You've probably seen that several
times throughout the course.

9
00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:22.965
What is this all about?

10
00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:28.345
Alright, imagine you have extremely
complicated components, right?

11
00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:32.235
And they render a bunch of images and
text and stuff like that.

12
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:36.825
And then the user refilters, and
it just swaps two components.

13
00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:40.747
What was here is now down here,
and what is here is now up here.

14
00:00:40.747 --> 00:00:44.091
React doesn't have a concept of,
what was here and what was where, and

15
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:47.046
so what it's gonna do is,
it's gonna tear down everything and

16
00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.247
rebuild everything from
the ground up again.

17
00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:54.627
Sometimes that's okay,
sometimes it's not okay.

18
00:00:55.647 --> 00:00:59.274
What key does when you're doing these
kind of map sort of things like we're

19
00:00:59.274 --> 00:00:59.965
doing here and

20
00:00:59.965 --> 00:01:03.782
there's a lot of peer components next
to each other that could be rearranged.

21
00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:08.019
We don't rearrange these,
but in theory, we could.

22
00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:11.762
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: What key does is saying,

23
00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:15.432
here is a unique thing
that's tied to this object.

24
00:01:16.762 --> 00:01:20.067
So, what's unique to a pizza,
its ID, right?

25
00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:23.663
And so that way, if we swap two things,
it's you had this here,

26
00:01:23.663 --> 00:01:25.833
and now you have it here, cuz I have this,

27
00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:30.227
like identifier that I can look at
to see this, move from here to here.

28
00:01:30.227 --> 00:01:33.630
I'm just gonna swap the components,
as opposed to tearing everything down and

29
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.707
rebuilding it, right?

30
00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:35.567
Does that make sense?

31
00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:38.997
So that's why it just
yells at you constantly.

32
00:01:38.997 --> 00:01:40.529
Please put a key on here.

33
00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:42.859
It is just a habit you want to get into.

34
00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.879
I would say here is a very
common misstep here.

35
00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.660
What happens if I grab the index?

36
00:01:53.348 --> 00:01:55.559
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Why is this not okay?

37
00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.109
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's not stable.

38
00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.192
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's not
height of the object,

39
00:02:00.192 --> 00:02:02.056
which I think is what you're getting at,
right?

40
00:02:02.056 --> 00:02:06.611
So if I move pepperoni from
index zero to index five,

41
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:10.346
pepperoni and zero weren't associated.

42
00:02:10.346 --> 00:02:15.906
So it's gonna think that it's okay,
five stayed in the same place.

43
00:02:15.906 --> 00:02:19.789
So I'm not gonna change anything and
it actually did change, right?

44
00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:24.747
So that's why you can't do it that way,
because the index and the object are not

45
00:02:24.747 --> 00:02:28.899
tied to each other there's no
relation between those two things.

46
00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.653
That being said, there's sometimes
there's just not a key to associate

47
00:02:33.653 --> 00:02:38.129
with something like sometimes it just
doesn't matter if it gets reorganized.

48
00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.280
So you'll find me doing this sometimes
where I just Want the linter to shut up

49
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.934
and get out of my way, right?

50
00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:46.629
You can do this this way and
put the index there.
