00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.278
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk about Vite.

2
00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:07.796
And I did check it is pronounced that way,
you can call it Vite, but

3
00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:12.168
it's supposed to be French for
quick, that's what I'm told.

4
00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:13.325
I don't speak French.

5
00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:20.220
So Vite, a pretty cool project
from the creator of Vue.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.060
What I found kind of interesting about
Vite, it's not actually the bundler,

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.052
the bundler is Rollup, right?

8
00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:31.319
And it has been since the beginning,
I think.

9
00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:36.765
They just put a lot of much better
developer experience around Rollup,

10
00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:41.871
cuz Rollup is a difficult thing
to tune and get working correctly.

11
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:45.784
Rollup is great, especially for bundling
modules and things that you're gonna

12
00:00:45.784 --> 00:00:50.599
publish, but it's not made for developer
experience, it's made for performance.

13
00:00:50.599 --> 00:00:54.285
It's why I taught Parcel for so
long as part of this course,

14
00:00:54.285 --> 00:00:57.919
I still like Parcel,
you're very welcome to use Parcel.

15
00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:00.702
But Vite has kinda just won at this point,
right?

16
00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:02.771
Everyone tends to use just Vite.

17
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:04.146
There's not really a lot of questions,

18
00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:07.077
the tooling around it just keeps
getting better and better.

19
00:01:07.077 --> 00:01:09.712
You'll see when we get to
the testing part of it.

20
00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:16.046
Vite makes Vitest very easy to use,
and they're just making it better.

21
00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:19.744
They started a company around it now, and

22
00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:24.288
they're going to change
from Rollup to Rolldown,

23
00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:30.115
as their bundler, which is a rust
based bundler for JavaScript.

24
00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:33.277
Kinda cool.

25
00:01:33.277 --> 00:01:35.593
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
it's gonna do a bunch of stuff for us.

26
00:01:35.593 --> 00:01:41.303
Right now, we have one file being imported
into one index.html directory, and that

27
00:01:41.303 --> 00:01:46.631
works with no build step, but now what
happens if we wanna have multiple files?

28
00:01:46.631 --> 00:01:48.466
Right?
And we wanna import in and

29
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.678
we wanna pull in different libraries and

30
00:01:50.678 --> 00:01:54.401
stuff like that, the complexity
just ratchets up exponentially.

31
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:58.799
And so Vite kinda helps us tame that down
to, you can just kind of read and write

32
00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.142
files as if they were already present,
which ends up being really helpful.

33
00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:07.346
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It makes pulling
things from NPM very easy and

34
00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:11.833
it'll handle everything like minifying our
code, all the other optimizing techniques

35
00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:14.343
that you don't really
wanna have to think about,

36
00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:18.563
they've already thought about that for
you, so you don't have to worry about it.

37
00:02:18.563 --> 00:02:24.122
So yeah previous versions we used Parcel,
awesome projects.

38
00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:27.478
They also might use.

39
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.810
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Rollup, no, I think they
actually wrote their own bundler, so

40
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.914
anyway, Parcel is cool, and
the old mainstay webpack,

41
00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:38.131
which has been around forever, right?

42
00:02:41.463 --> 00:02:45.865
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So, we're gonna do this
though, we're gonna get vite@5.4.2 and

43
00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.645
vite.js/plugin-react.

44
00:02:47.645 --> 00:02:52.583
These are kind of our two minimum
requirements to get started with Vite.

45
00:02:54.184 --> 00:02:55.528
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
we're just gonna copy and

46
00:02:55.528 --> 00:03:01.344
paste that in here
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And

47
00:03:01.344 --> 00:03:03.919
that should install our stuff for us.

48
00:03:06.534 --> 00:03:11.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and then what we're
gonna do here is we're gonna go to

49
00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.236
index.html, close this for a second.

50
00:03:14.236 --> 00:03:18.178
We wanna get rid of these two script tags.

51
00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.979
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then from here
you have to do one more thing.

52
00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.955
You're gonna have to say type="module",

53
00:03:30.955 --> 00:03:38.365
you need to let Vite know that you're
gonna be working with modules.

54
00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:40.566
And actually, I don't think it
even works with common JS anymore.

55
00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.982
They basically just said, look,
if you wanna be using Vite,

56
00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:44.054
you got to be on ES modules.

57
00:03:44.054 --> 00:03:46.934
That's what we've been talking
about this entire time.

58
00:03:48.014 --> 00:03:50.725
That's so, shouldn't be a big deal.

59
00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:53.597
But yeah, make sure you add that
type=module or it's gonna yell at you.

60
00:03:55.954 --> 00:04:03.575
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay,
now make a vite.config.js files.

61
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:14.291
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we are going to do
import, defineConfig, not from Rollup.

62
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.236
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From Vite.

63
00:04:19.438 --> 00:04:24.365
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: We're going to import,
react from

64
00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:29.298
@vitejs/plugin-react, cool.

65
00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:35.066
And then we're going to
export default defineConfig.

66
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.864
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna have
plugins, I just love this autocompletion.

67
00:04:44.976 --> 00:04:46.309
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And it's gonna be an array.

68
00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:49.294
We're gonna give it react, which is
a function that you have to invoke.

69
00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:52.914
And you should end up
with something like this.

70
00:04:53.954 --> 00:04:57.528
So at its most basic, Vite handles
most of this stuff out of the box so

71
00:04:57.528 --> 00:05:00.186
you don't really have to
configure it very much.

72
00:05:00.186 --> 00:05:03.930
The only thing that we have to say is,
this is a React project,

73
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.614
you're gonna have to do React type things,
and that's it.

74
00:05:13.662 --> 00:05:14.432
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

75
00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:18.676
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's go
back to our terminal.

76
00:05:22.236 --> 00:05:26.083
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And we're gonna do npm i,
or install whatever you want, but

77
00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:31.591
not the dash capital D because we're going
to install some production dependencies,

78
00:05:31.591 --> 00:05:33.109
not dev dependencies.

79
00:05:33.109 --> 00:05:37.663
As a total side note, it really doesn't
matter very much cuz you're always gonna

80
00:05:37.663 --> 00:05:40.644
build your project before
it goes out to production.

81
00:05:40.644 --> 00:05:46.877
So whether it's the dev dependency or not,
everything gets installed every time,

82
00:05:46.877 --> 00:05:51.456
but some people find that
distinction extremely important.

83
00:05:51.456 --> 00:05:54.994
So npm install react,

84
00:05:54.994 --> 00:06:00.583
we're gonna do @18.3.1 and

85
00:06:00.583 --> 00:06:05.434
react-dom@18.3.1.

86
00:06:05.434 --> 00:06:09.634
Now, people are asking me,
why are we not doing 19?

87
00:06:09.634 --> 00:06:13.272
19 still is not officially stable yet,
it's in release candidate,

88
00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:16.861
it's stable-ish, and we'll talk
about it at the end of the course.

89
00:06:16.861 --> 00:06:19.963
But once react 19 is stable,
then we will come back and

90
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:22.352
we'll do a complete intro to React v10.

91
00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.272
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Will this
course work with 19?

92
00:06:26.272 --> 00:06:30.104
Almost certainly, they're not changing
very much they're not taking very much

93
00:06:30.104 --> 00:06:33.508
out, everything that I am teaching
you today applies 100% to 19.

94
00:06:33.508 --> 00:06:36.132
They've already told us all
the stuff they're taking out,

95
00:06:36.132 --> 00:06:37.889
I'm not teaching you any of that stuff.

96
00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:43.962
It's just that, so, extremely likely that
if 19 is out by the time that you're

97
00:06:43.962 --> 00:06:49.699
watching this course, you could
just use 19, but if you do 18.3.1.

98
00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:53.774
I can guarantee you everything
I tested with 18 and

99
00:06:53.774 --> 00:07:00.457
also everything applies to 19, so have no
fear of taking this even with react 18.

100
00:07:06.448 --> 00:07:12.616
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Interesting, what's- says
that there's a security vulnerability.

101
00:07:12.616 --> 00:07:14.983
By the way,
by the time that you watch this course,

102
00:07:14.983 --> 00:07:17.805
there will certainly be lots
of security vulnerabilities.

103
00:07:17.805 --> 00:07:23.675
That's very normal, I'm not telling you to
install a Bitcoin miner on your computer,

104
00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:26.467
just mine, not anyone else's, right?

105
00:07:26.467 --> 00:07:27.983
So don't worry too much about that.

106
00:07:27.983 --> 00:07:31.096
If you want to,
you can see if npm audit fix will work.

107
00:07:31.096 --> 00:07:35.826
Sometimes it doesn't, look, we did, I did
it, we fixed it, I fixed the Internet.

108
00:07:35.826 --> 00:07:36.349
All right.

109
00:07:38.821 --> 00:07:40.759
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All this does is
it goes and finds a package, sees

110
00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:43.957
if there's a patch version that's
available that just fixes the problem.

111
00:07:43.957 --> 00:07:46.402
If it does, then it installs that,
that's all it does.

112
00:07:46.402 --> 00:07:49.108
Okay, let's go use Vite.

113
00:07:50.718 --> 00:07:54.616
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So we're gonna
go to our source directory, and

114
00:07:54.616 --> 00:08:01.242
the first thing I wanna do here is we have
deleted these script tags from our html,

115
00:08:01.242 --> 00:08:07.104
so that means React is no longer
available in our project, right?

116
00:08:07.104 --> 00:08:12.547
So in app.js we're going to go import
'react' so that we can use it.

117
00:08:12.547 --> 00:08:17.568
We're gonna say import React from

118
00:08:17.568 --> 00:08:22.767
react and import {createRoot}.

119
00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:30.724
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: From 'react-dom'.

120
00:08:30.724 --> 00:08:35.758
And then down here, I think we'll
have to go delete the ReactDOM.

121
00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:42.617
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, so Vite will take
care of plugging in React here so

122
00:08:42.617 --> 00:08:47.582
that all these React references
will now work, right?

123
00:08:47.582 --> 00:08:50.816
And when you have no curly braces here,

124
00:08:50.816 --> 00:08:56.798
this means import the entire library
as one top-level object, right?

125
00:08:56.798 --> 00:09:01.308
Or maybe a different way of saying
is import whatever the library

126
00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:06.000
author has designated as the default
export of whatever React is.

127
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.524
And I will say that's normally all
of the things as one giant object,

128
00:09:10.524 --> 00:09:12.322
but it doesn't have to be.

129
00:09:12.322 --> 00:09:15.514
And then this is called a named import,

130
00:09:15.514 --> 00:09:19.673
where you're saying go to
the ReactDOM library and

131
00:09:19.673 --> 00:09:24.525
only get the createRoot function
in this particular case.

132
00:09:24.525 --> 00:09:27.271
That's what those curly braces mean.

133
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:29.592
This is a default export,
this is a named export.

134
00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:34.088
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay?

135
00:09:34.088 --> 00:09:37.368
First of all, one of the cool things is,
I think we fixed lint.

136
00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:39.169
I think if you say npm run lint,

137
00:09:39.169 --> 00:09:43.273
you should get no errors now because
now there's no globals, right?

138
00:09:43.273 --> 00:09:44.988
We know where everything is coming from.

139
00:09:46.846 --> 00:09:47.784
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So that's pretty cool.

140
00:09:51.869 --> 00:09:53.834
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
now let's go and make it so

141
00:09:53.834 --> 00:09:57.616
that we can actually run Vite
to actually run our server.

142
00:09:59.486 --> 00:10:01.850
So I want you to go to your package.json,
and

143
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.786
we're gonna add a couple more
things into our scripts.

144
00:10:07.533 --> 00:10:12.333
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I don't know why I have
a habit of keeping these alphabetized, but

145
00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:16.891
it just became a compulsion one day and
I just never stopped it.

146
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:20.519
So build, vite build.

147
00:10:21.739 --> 00:10:26.014
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Dev, vite and

148
00:10:26.014 --> 00:10:34.896
preview is vite,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Preview.

149
00:10:41.942 --> 00:10:44.261
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Some people might say,
well, this looks better like this,

150
00:10:44.261 --> 00:10:44.859
I don't know.

151
00:10:44.859 --> 00:10:46.921
Honestly, it doesn't really
matter what the order here,

152
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:48.249
whatever you wanna do is fine with me.

153
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:51.983
So let's talk about these
commands we put in here.

154
00:10:51.983 --> 00:10:55.174
Nine times out of ten, when you come
to your local development environment,

155
00:10:55.174 --> 00:10:57.825
you're just gonna say Vite and
you're just gonna get going, so

156
00:10:57.825 --> 00:10:59.713
you can do npm run dev and
start your project.

157
00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:04.427
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I have such strong
muscle memory to go do npm run dev for

158
00:11:04.427 --> 00:11:08.018
any project I get into that I make sure
that that's always the command that I

159
00:11:08.018 --> 00:11:08.592
wanna run.

160
00:11:08.592 --> 00:11:12.848
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Build, this is something

161
00:11:12.848 --> 00:11:17.897
that you would run in a GitHub action
that would actually build the project

162
00:11:17.897 --> 00:11:23.029
into static assets and such, that then
you could ship off to Vercel or AWS or

163
00:11:23.029 --> 00:11:28.339
Netlify or Fly or something like that,
and you could serve those from there.

164
00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:30.816
And then preview is kind
of an interesting one.

165
00:11:30.816 --> 00:11:34.520
I don't know if you've ever had a bug that
only seemed to manifest whenever you built

166
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.811
the project,
as opposed to run it on the dev server,

167
00:11:36.811 --> 00:11:38.239
preview aims to help with that.

168
00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.552
It's like, I'm gonna build this for
production, and then I'm gonna serve it

169
00:11:41.552 --> 00:11:44.782
to as if this was a production box to
help you kinda figure out those problems.

170
00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:50.361
So I almost never use it, but when I
do need to use it, I'm glad it's there.

171
00:11:57.669 --> 00:12:04.218
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then one more thing,
make sure you add a "type": "module".

172
00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:08.909
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again,
the order here is not important.

173
00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:14.547
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is just telling
any tool that uses your project,

174
00:12:14.547 --> 00:12:20.259
this uses ES modules, as opposed to using
common JS, which is the "require" style.

175
00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:23.702
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
that can be helpful as well.

176
00:12:31.673 --> 00:12:36.373
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: All right,
so, now in theory,

177
00:12:36.373 --> 00:12:41.072
npm run dev, she gets something

178
00:12:41.072 --> 00:12:46.132
that looks somewhat akin to this.

179
00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:55.736
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So
you might be wondering, why 5173?

180
00:12:55.736 --> 00:13:01.842
I did two, that's why I went looked it up,
what's five in roman numerals?

181
00:13:01.842 --> 00:13:02.524
V.

182
00:13:02.524 --> 00:13:05.515
V, do you get it now?

183
00:13:05.515 --> 00:13:10.662
[LAUGH] V-I-T-E.

184
00:13:10.662 --> 00:13:12.136
Roman numerals and lead speak.

185
00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:15.183
Yeah, I was like,
that's a stretch for sure, guys.

186
00:13:15.183 --> 00:13:16.239
[LAUGH] Yeah, but

187
00:13:16.239 --> 00:13:20.914
you can see now this all still works
exactly the way that it was before, but

188
00:13:20.914 --> 00:13:26.516
now we're using imports from for our React
stuff, and it's being served on 5173.

189
00:13:26.516 --> 00:13:28.535
So go back to app.js.

190
00:13:31.339 --> 00:13:35.078
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And I fixed it here
already, but you see react-dom,

191
00:13:35.078 --> 00:13:38.856
this is originally what I had in here,
the ReactDOM.

192
00:13:38.856 --> 00:13:40.710
You just need to put react-dom/client.

193
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.576
This is the old way of writing it, this
is the way that people used to write it,

194
00:13:44.576 --> 00:13:47.748
which is why it's still
kind of burned in my brain.

195
00:13:47.748 --> 00:13:52.125
And I think it'll work through React 18,
but they might break it in React 19 or

196
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:54.037
React 20 or something like that.

197
00:13:54.037 --> 00:13:58.139
So just put react-dom/client and
everything should work.
