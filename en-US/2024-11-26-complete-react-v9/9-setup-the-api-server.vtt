00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.562
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Let's talk just a tiny
tiny moment about the API server for

2
00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:10.848
the rest of this project, so
let's just open it in GitHub,

3
00:00:10.848 --> 00:00:15.120
so in the project that I
had you clone earlier.

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.896
There is an API directory, I wrote a
little API for the rest of your project so

5
00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:23.511
that we can do some get requests and
post requests and all that kind of stuff.

6
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:26.259
It's just a little Fastify Node.js App,

7
00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.913
I'm not even gonna purport that it's
any good, but it does work [LAUGH],

8
00:00:30.913 --> 00:00:36.111
I don't need you to edit it at all for
the entire remainder of the course.

9
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:40.771
You just got to run it,
so let's just look at it,

10
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:46.001
if we go to our GitHub here,
it's this API directory,

11
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:50.096
you can see it's a little package.json,

12
00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:54.219
it's got Fastify, and that's about it.

13
00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:58.250
It has a SQLite database, and

14
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.269
I think it's got all of our
static assets in there as well,

15
00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.287
so it has the CSS,
all of the pizza images and all of the CSS,

16
00:01:08.287 --> 00:01:13.537
yeah, all that stuff I didn't
want you to have to deal with.

17
00:01:15.697 --> 00:01:18.906
So, and
then you can see here in the server.js,

18
00:01:18.906 --> 00:01:24.074
it's just a Fastify project, and
doesn't really do any much more than this,

19
00:01:24.074 --> 00:01:27.308
but not stuff that you have
to worry about at all.

20
00:01:30.218 --> 00:01:34.687
Okay, so
in whatever terminal that you're in,

21
00:01:34.687 --> 00:01:40.464
navigate to your API directory,
so you can see I'm in Complete

22
00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:46.584
Intro to React V9 project /api,
two things, npm install.

23
00:01:51.199 --> 00:01:56.152
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again, vulnerabilities
doesn't matter, it's okay, and

24
00:01:56.152 --> 00:02:00.544
then npm,
let's do run dev cuz that'll be just fine.

25
00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:07.076
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Okay, and
you should see something like this.

26
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:13.790
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So if you go to localhost,

27
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.071
3000 just gonna give you some sort of
404 error, or something like this.

28
00:02:20.353 --> 00:02:23.572
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think it's API/pizzas,
yeah,

29
00:02:23.572 --> 00:02:30.008
if you go to API/pizzas on port 3000,
you should get 31 pizzas,

30
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:34.941
I think is how many I had in there,
or 32 actually, so

31
00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:39.366
what we wanna do is we wanna
use Vite as the proxy.

32
00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:43.713
And again, this doesn't you don't really
need to understand this too in depth but

33
00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:47.891
essentially we wanna run our front end and
our back end on the same port, right.

34
00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:52.862
So we want everything running
through port 5173 so that we don't

35
00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:57.919
have to worry about CORS what that is bless you,

36
00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.965
if you do know what it is
you've been where I am, right?

37
00:03:01.965 --> 00:03:06.689
So we're gonna run everything through
Vite, luckily, Vite makes this very easy

38
00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.318
to accomplish, so
I want you to open your vite.config.js and

39
00:03:10.318 --> 00:03:12.934
we're just gonna add
one little thing here.

40
00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:18.963
We're gonna add server, and
we're gonna put a comma there and

41
00:03:18.963 --> 00:03:25.148
we're gonna add a proxy,
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And so you add

42
00:03:25.148 --> 00:03:30.367
basically things that you wanna be proxied
through this, and so for /api.

43
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:36.334
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: You want to
run that through target.

44
00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:40.900
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: http://localhost.

45
00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.985
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: 3,000, if you have not
stopped your server from earlier in

46
00:03:47.985 --> 00:03:52.694
the course, please do that now or else
this will interfere with this, by the way.

47
00:03:54.485 --> 00:03:58.996
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And then you wanna
add a change origin as well 3,000,

48
00:03:58.996 --> 00:04:03.691
change, origin to be true and
we're gonna do that as well for

49
00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:08.958
public almost actually literally
the exact same thing for public.

50
00:04:17.372 --> 00:04:20.843
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's it, so I added this.

51
00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:28.308
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: This is going to
proxy all of the requests from

52
00:04:28.308 --> 00:04:35.231
localhost:5173 on /api and
/public to localhost:3000,

53
00:04:35.231 --> 00:04:42.548
so just to prove my point here,
I'm running my Vite server here,

54
00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:46.826
I'm gonna open this in my local host.

55
00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:50.601
And if I do /API/pizzas like
we were just looking at,

56
00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:55.277
notice it still goes to that same API,
so notice that this and this,

57
00:04:55.277 --> 00:05:00.385
despite the fact that they're on
different ports, same thing, right.

58
00:05:02.752 --> 00:05:06.766
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: That's all that does for
you, it makes local dev much easier,

59
00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:10.552
you used to have to do some black
magic and some seances to get

60
00:05:10.552 --> 00:05:14.601
this to work correctly, now,
Vite makes it very easy, yeah.

61
00:05:14.601 --> 00:05:18.013
Would that work for
any local host number, then,

62
00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:21.598
it's just specifically looking for
anything API.

63
00:05:21.598 --> 00:05:24.434
Yep, so
it's only processing things after the API,

64
00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:27.144
and it doesn't even have to be local host,
right,

65
00:05:27.144 --> 00:05:30.504
you can proxy it to like your
database in the the cloud, right?

66
00:05:30.504 --> 00:05:34.150
Because you're just saying what the target
is, the target can be anything, right?

67
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.113
We're just doing it now in local host,
but this could be your lambdas on AWS, or

68
00:05:39.113 --> 00:05:40.532
something like that.

69
00:05:43.398 --> 00:05:45.174
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's a pretty cool feature,
I think it's,

70
00:05:45.174 --> 00:05:48.539
even if this doesn't make total sense, as
long as this is working, you don't have to

71
00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:51.280
think about it anymore, which is
probably half the benefit as well.
