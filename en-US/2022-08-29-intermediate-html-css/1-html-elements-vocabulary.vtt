WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.870
This is where we usually start on day one,

2
00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.830
minute number one of a standard
Boot Camp type of course.

3
00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.104
HTML, what does it stand for?

4
00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:09.950
And you say the hypertext markup language.

5
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.736
And we go great, here's div,
here's span and we move on, but

6
00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:16.530
this is what I want you
to be sure that you know.

7
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.514
It's identifying
the elements of the webpage.

8
00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:26.955
It is not responsible for the display of
the webpage and a lot of people do this.

9
00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:31.347
In fact just last week, I was watching
a video from a front end Boot Camp full

10
00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:36.045
stack Boot Camp, where somebody was
talking about HTML and changing the HTML.

11
00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:40.770
And then saying look,
see how it impacts the look of the page.

12
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.980
Nothing could be more incorrect.

13
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.008
You don't think of HTML as
a way to style the page.

14
00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:49.664
We can override anything in CSS.

15
00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:53.157
And again, that's the whole focus of
what we're gonna talk about today.

16
00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:57.199
HTML comes with all kinds of hidden
treasures for accessibility,

17
00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.892
search engine optimization, artificial
intelligence I think is something

18
00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:03.997
we ought to start thinking about.

19
00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:05.829
As you mark up a page semantically,

20
00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.891
artificial intelligence will
be better able to digest it.

21
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.487
And this is the moment that we
pivot from content to code.

22
00:01:12.487 --> 00:01:14.434
There's an annual report that comes out.

23
00:01:14.434 --> 00:01:17.755
This is the HTTP Archive
2021 State of the Web.

24
00:01:17.755 --> 00:01:23.446
And they tell us that there
are 112 HTML elements.

25
00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:26.823
But 50% of web pages are using 31 or
fewer.

26
00:01:26.823 --> 00:01:29.381
Protip, five of those
are just in the header

27
00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:32.400
of the document when you
start a new VS code.

28
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.411
HTML document is gonna be HTML body,
head, meta and title,

29
00:01:37.411 --> 00:01:43.330
those five elements are already there
on the page for you of those 31.

30
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.220
So we're using 28% of our vocabulary.

31
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.680
It's like we're toddlers,
little toddlers running around.

32
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.757
We don't know the entire English language.

33
00:01:53.757 --> 00:01:56.067
So we can do better than this, how?

34
00:01:56.067 --> 00:01:59.846
If we take a look at how these
elements have changed over time,

35
00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:01.306
they really haven't.

36
00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:06.601
Especially in the last three years,
the top elements we like to use are div,

37
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:09.687
span a, li, image, script, paragraph.

38
00:02:09.687 --> 00:02:12.619
And then down towards the bottom,
you start to see a little bit of a trend.

39
00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:17.229
Notice that the i element
has fallen off a little bit.

40
00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.895
I which does not mean icon but

41
00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:23.220
Font Awesome would like you
to believe that that is true.

42
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.580
And so Font Awesome is dropping
off probably in favor of SVG.

43
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.115
So from the font that is normally there.

44
00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:32.918
And option is dropping off the list
probably because it's hard to style.

45
00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:37.167
Meta is a little bit on the rise
probably because of social media images.

46
00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:39.641
So we have a vocabulary crisis in HTML.

47
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:43.389
This has always been my
assumption that people don't

48
00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:49.040
use these HTML elements because
they don't know that they exist.

49
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.166
If you knew that they existed, maybe you
would be more inclined to use them rather

50
00:02:53.166 --> 00:02:56.578
than writing all of the workarounds
that we do with divs and spans.

51
00:02:56.578 --> 00:02:59.476
So that is part of the focus for today.

52
00:02:59.476 --> 00:03:04.266
Because people don't know HTML,
you wind up seeing like this.

53
00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:07.144
This is from HTMHell, great website.

54
00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:12.744
Shows you how here's somebody who is
retroengineered a list with paragraphs and

55
00:03:12.744 --> 00:03:17.860
line breaks as opposed to the unordered
list which comes for free in HTML.

56
00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.865
Here's another guy, Mark Steadman put out
this post last week or a week or two ago.

57
00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:31.123
And on the right hand side here we
have an unordered list with HTML.

58
00:03:31.123 --> 00:03:35.770
And on the left hand side,
here is how you would have to code that

59
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.767
using just divs and spans with all
of the various Aria and roles and so

60
00:03:40.767 --> 00:03:43.587
forth in order to make it accessible.

61
00:03:43.587 --> 00:03:46.190
And this has always bothered me.

62
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.970
Why would you go and
recode what HTML gives you for free?

63
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.120
You wouldn't do that in JavaScript.

64
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.129
You wouldn't go and

65
00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.460
recode one of the functions that
come natively with JavaScript.

66
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.770
You would just use it because
it's there and it works.

67
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.700
So why do we feel any do this with HTML?

68
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.700
It's all there for you for free.

69
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.442
So when you use semantic HTML,

70
00:04:08.442 --> 00:04:11.864
you're gonna be able to access
interesting CSS selectors.

71
00:04:11.864 --> 00:04:16.383
You don't have to apply 25 different
classes to a given HTML element to get

72
00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:18.220
what you want.

73
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.150
Remember that this is all about styling
on patterns and not on exceptions.

74
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.320
So if we had to think
about HTML as a model,

75
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.640
it would probably be close to
something like a regular expression.

76
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.110
We're looking for
a pattern somewhere inside of our HTML.

77
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.359
When that pattern is found,
we apply a certain kind of styling.

78
00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.552
In the background on top of that, we have
a whole series of if statements that

79
00:04:40.552 --> 00:04:45.020
are talking about what is going to
take priority over what along the way.

80
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.552
And those are not necessarily written
down in a way that's easy to understand,

81
00:04:48.552 --> 00:04:51.500
which is what leads to a lot
of confusion along the way.

82
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.870
So the HTML references here,
this is a great webpage to take a look at.

83
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.210
We take a look at the HTML page reference.

84
00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.572
Let me just run through this really,
really fast and

85
00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:03.975
show you what's on this page.

86
00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:06.393
It's gonna show you that
our root is called HTML.

87
00:05:06.393 --> 00:05:10.211
It's gonna show us elements that
appear in the head of the document

88
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.991
which are document metadata.

89
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:16.764
There's probably a few in here you haven't
heard of before like base which can

90
00:05:16.764 --> 00:05:20.970
identify the base URL to use for
the all the relative URLs in the site.

91
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.400
Then we have our body element.

92
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.201
Then we have all these elements that
are here for content sectioning.

93
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:32.071
We're gonna talk about these later
on today including articles and

94
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:35.667
aside and nav and section and
all the rest of that.

95
00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:40.160
The content ones for text are really
interesting and a lot of fun.

96
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.400
You'll find all kinds of
interesting things in here.

97
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:46.420
We're gonna talk about several of
these today, not quite all of them.

98
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.496
There's also inline elements
that are useful for

99
00:05:50.496 --> 00:05:55.833
identifying parts of code,
including things like cite, code,

100
00:05:55.833 --> 00:06:01.767
definition, keyboard, mark,
various stamp or s for strikethrough.

101
00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:03.393
So you can read through all of those.

102
00:06:03.393 --> 00:06:05.202
And then we have images and multimedia.

103
00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:09.500
Down here, these are ones that will help
you display audio and video on a webpage.

104
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.077
Some of these are a little
bit older like area and

105
00:06:12.077 --> 00:06:14.470
map which have to do
with clickable images.

106
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.135
Back in the old days when we
used to do a lot of layouts,

107
00:06:17.135 --> 00:06:18.680
we had a great big huge image.

108
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.590
It had clickable areas.

109
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.600
And we programed that in Dreamweaver.

110
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.670
Unfortunately, that
technology is not responsive.

111
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.124
You'd have to pair it with JavaScript in
order to make the clickable area respond

112
00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:32.140
with screen size.

113
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.149
Back in the old days we didn't
have to worry about that.

114
00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:37.491
So that's what those are for.

115
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:40.183
We also have a few that are here for

116
00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:46.250
embedded content including things like
iframes and objects and so forth.

117
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.671
There's a few for SVG and MathML.

118
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:50.959
So SVG, you're probably familiar with.

119
00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:54.360
Scalable vector graphics, we're gonna do
a little bit with those later on today.

120
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.190
MathML is the math markup language.

121
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.620
It's a whole separate language.

122
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.746
If you wanna put math online and
mark it up,

123
00:07:01.746 --> 00:07:04.180
that's a whole separate
thing to take a look at.

124
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.040
We have a few for scripting that are here.

125
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.210
We have a few for editing.

126
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.490
We have all our tables.

127
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.760
We have all our forms.

128
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.257
We have interactive elements like details,

129
00:07:15.257 --> 00:07:18.022
everybody's excited about
details in summary.

130
00:07:18.022 --> 00:07:22.177
And dialogue,
notice it's a very small part of the HTML.

131
00:07:22.177 --> 00:07:25.760
And a few that are here for
web components like slot and template.

132
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.386
Then there's a few that are deprecated.

133
00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:30.229
So I just wanted to point
this out to you that look,

134
00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.564
there's a huge page here that
just puts it all in summary.

135
00:07:33.564 --> 00:07:35.305
You can just scroll through this thing.

136
00:07:35.305 --> 00:07:40.049
It's very straightforward to take a quick
peek at what is available in terms of HTML

137
00:07:40.049 --> 00:07:40.744
elements.

138
00:07:40.744 --> 00:07:44.387
Maybe you can learn one every day or
every week if that's too much.
