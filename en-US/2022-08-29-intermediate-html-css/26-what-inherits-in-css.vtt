00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.437
We will be talking about three
very related CSS topics today,

2
00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:07.775
inheritance, specificity and the cascade.

3
00:00:07.775 --> 00:00:14.345
And I am gonna rip off will sentences
title he does JavaScript the hard parts.

4
00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:17.385
We would consider this to
be CSS the hard parts,

5
00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:22.490
these are concepts that you encounter
every single time that you work with CSS.

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.684
But you've probably never
studied them in detail,

7
00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.806
you've never had anyone
explain them in detail and

8
00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:33.027
this is where a lot of the confusion
comes from when working with CSS.

9
00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:37.251
So let's take a quick overview of
what all of the three parts are and

10
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:41.484
then we're going to go into talking
about inheritance in detail.

11
00:00:41.484 --> 00:00:46.489
So the big C and CSS it's right in
the name is off is the cascade and

12
00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.957
it encompasses all three of
these particular concepts.

13
00:00:50.957 --> 00:00:54.807
The Cascade will govern
exactly how inheritance and

14
00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:59.281
specificity factor into what's
happening in the cascade.

15
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.722
But which is why becomes the C and
CSS, but

16
00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:06.664
all three of these are worth
studying in depth.

17
00:01:06.664 --> 00:01:09.169
So first of all we have inheritance.

18
00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.555
Inheritance says that styling
is applying to an element,

19
00:01:12.555 --> 00:01:15.122
is going to apply to
all of its descendants.

20
00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:19.597
So if we say for example the body is
gonna have a font family of Ariel all of

21
00:01:19.597 --> 00:01:24.224
the descendants of the body and there
are basically all of them are going to

22
00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:27.528
have that same font family
in that particular case.

23
00:01:27.528 --> 00:01:31.078
We're gonna look at that
in detail In a moment.

24
00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:35.951
Specificity has to do with the relevance
of a given style to a selected

25
00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:37.470
portion of the page.

26
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.740
We need to take a look at all of the
styles we've written, we need to figure

27
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.436
out which one of those is going to quote
win, specificity is a part of that step.

28
00:01:48.436 --> 00:01:51.907
And then finally we have
the cascade which is,

29
00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:57.875
given that we have styles coming from
our user agent, the browser style sheet.

30
00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:02.567
From the user sometimes people write their
own style sheets because perhaps because

31
00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:06.861
of visual issues, they might prefer to
have say a black background with white

32
00:02:06.861 --> 00:02:11.244
writing on every site that they visit
the user can write their own style sheet.

33
00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:14.244
And then we have the style
sheets that we write,

34
00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:16.721
those are called author style sheets.

35
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:20.691
The author style sheets may be coming
from the external style sheet,

36
00:02:20.691 --> 00:02:23.571
the separate style sheet
that we normally write.

37
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:27.714
They may be coming from the head of
the document called an embedded or

38
00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:32.016
an internal style sheet, or
they may be coming from an inline source.

39
00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:36.591
The other thing we'll factor in here
is the importance of those styles,

40
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.174
most styles are normal.

41
00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:43.115
And then of course we have our old friend
being important which we'll find out

42
00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:46.537
should be used very very
sparingly way more sparingly

43
00:02:46.537 --> 00:02:50.281
than a lot of us are using it
in web development these days.

44
00:02:50.281 --> 00:02:54.300
So that is the arc of what
we're going to be covering.

45
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.369
Let's get started then with Inheritance.

46
00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.572
Inheritance is exactly
what it sounds like.

47
00:03:00.572 --> 00:03:05.326
If you think about the people who
come up to you on the street and

48
00:03:05.326 --> 00:03:08.719
say you have your grandmother's smile.

49
00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.573
It is exactly the same kind
of thing here in inheritance.

50
00:03:13.573 --> 00:03:18.978
There are certain types of CSS properties,
that are passed on to their

51
00:03:18.978 --> 00:03:24.761
descendants and there are predictable
as to which ones of these there are.

52
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:28.122
So, I'll give you some hints for
how to take a look at that.

53
00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:30.723
If you're a programmer,
a way to think about this is as follows.

54
00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:34.243
So, here I have a tiny little bit of HTML.

55
00:03:34.243 --> 00:03:37.168
We're just going to have an h 1 and
a paragraph.

56
00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:42.141
And over here I say that the body
color is going to be red.

57
00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:43.165
What is going to be red?

58
00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:47.653
If we were to drop this into code pen and
look at it, the h 1 and

59
00:03:47.653 --> 00:03:52.415
the P would both be red Because
they are descendants of the body.

60
00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:57.216
If I add F to this a paragraph and
say that the color is blue and

61
00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:01.632
we were to take a look at this,
our h 1 would still be red

62
00:04:01.632 --> 00:04:05.975
it's still inheriting that
red color from the body.

63
00:04:05.975 --> 00:04:08.750
But the paragraph would be blue because,

64
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.031
we have a more targeted style that
is going to get to the paragraph

65
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:17.729
specifically in other words that
paragraph is overriding that body.

66
00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:23.733
Some of that is cascade ordering you may
think, because the paragraph comes later.

67
00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:28.950
But if we were to actually rearrange these
and put the paragraph style first and

68
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.912
the body style second,
the paragraph would still be blue.

69
00:04:32.912 --> 00:04:36.844
And I'm gonna demonstrate a little
bit more of that in just a moment.

70
00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:40.844
Another way to think about this for
those of you who do a lot of programming,

71
00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:43.652
is to think about global styling and
local styling.

72
00:04:43.652 --> 00:04:47.025
We don't really have these
concepts of global and

73
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:51.457
local inside of CSS the way you
do in many programming languages.

74
00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:54.757
But if you think about the body is
where we can set global styling,

75
00:04:54.757 --> 00:04:58.962
generally speaking, this is where we're
gonna put the styling for our Document.

76
00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:03.674
And then later we'll override
it on a case by case basis,

77
00:05:03.674 --> 00:05:07.909
that you could think of
that as your local styling.

78
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.995
Let's talk about what types of
properties yo're gonna inherit and

79
00:05:10.995 --> 00:05:12.029
what don't inherit.

80
00:05:12.029 --> 00:05:15.775
Fortunately it's not really
all that hard to remember,

81
00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:19.532
basically the things that
inherit have to do with fonts.

82
00:05:19.532 --> 00:05:23.856
So, all of the font properties
like font family or font style or

83
00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.823
color all of those inherit.

84
00:05:25.823 --> 00:05:30.422
The lists inherit as we
have seen previously.

85
00:05:30.422 --> 00:05:36.098
The types of markers that are there
can be inherited by the children.

86
00:05:36.098 --> 00:05:40.141
We have text that can be inherited,
like text transform,

87
00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:44.522
which take makes your letters
go from lowercase to uppercase.

88
00:05:44.522 --> 00:05:49.656
For example, Text alignment left right,
Text Indent indenting things.

89
00:05:49.656 --> 00:05:53.267
We have the space properties,
whether it is letter space,

90
00:05:53.267 --> 00:05:57.615
line, space, word space, line height,
all of those are inherited.

91
00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:00.177
And then finally,
there's a couple of odd ones,

92
00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:03.359
we'll take a look at visibility
in detail a little bit later.

93
00:06:03.359 --> 00:06:07.959
Widows and orphans, often used in print
styling, where we want to be sure that we

94
00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:12.645
don't have one word hanging out on a line
by itself, that's widows and orphans.

95
00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:15.548
And border-collapse,
which is using tables,

96
00:06:15.548 --> 00:06:18.662
where we can collapse
the border between the cells so

97
00:06:18.662 --> 00:06:23.006
we don't have a little bit of gap in
between all of the cells in our table.

98
00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:28.054
The things that don't inherit,
basically have to do with the box model.

99
00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:32.316
So, margins, padding, borders,
none of those inherit.

100
00:06:32.316 --> 00:06:35.026
The display property doesn't inherit.

101
00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:38.716
So, if you think about that,
that does not inherit.

102
00:06:38.716 --> 00:06:43.902
Positioning so absolute relative fixed,
positioning all that does not inherit.

103
00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:47.581
Floats do not inherit,
backgrounds, background colors,

104
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:50.690
background images,
those do not inherit either.

105
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:56.130
Things that are separate and then their
own special world, grid and Flex box.

106
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:01.658
Because remember I have a whole course
that's devoted to grid and Flex box, we

107
00:07:01.658 --> 00:07:07.463
have a declaration on the parent, that's
where we display flex or display grid.

108
00:07:07.463 --> 00:07:12.394
And the children of that parent have
very specific properties that go with it

109
00:07:12.394 --> 00:07:14.636
that are not passed on after that.

110
00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:16.612
So that's kind of unique in the world.

111
00:07:16.612 --> 00:07:21.532
Either it inherits and and
inherits forever, or it doesn't inherit,

112
00:07:21.532 --> 00:07:22.852
and that's that.

113
00:07:22.852 --> 00:07:26.266
Those can be controlled,
we're gonna look at this as well.

114
00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:30.116
There are properties and
values that can control inheritance and

115
00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:33.415
we're gonna take a look at
that in detail momentarily.

116
00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:37.374
The best place to go if you're
wondering if something inherits is MDN.

117
00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:41.688
So if you go to MDN under their formal
definition which you'll find for

118
00:07:41.688 --> 00:07:45.270
most properties in CSS,
you'll see this little table and

119
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:48.283
you just wanna look for
where it says inherited.

120
00:07:48.283 --> 00:07:50.570
It's yes or its no.

121
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:54.297
And that will tell you whether
something is inherited or not.

122
00:07:54.297 --> 00:07:58.774
Direct declarations are going
to win over inherited styles.

123
00:07:58.774 --> 00:08:02.564
Now I'm gonna say this to you now and
you're gonna go.

124
00:08:02.564 --> 00:08:08.184
Okay, that sounds great but as we're
gonna demonstrate here momentarily,

125
00:08:08.184 --> 00:08:13.200
even if you have an incredibly
specific selector that is full of IDs,

126
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.939
it's full of classes.

127
00:08:14.939 --> 00:08:18.947
It can still be beaten by
a single little type selector,

128
00:08:18.947 --> 00:08:23.826
If those are not pointing to the actual
text that needs to be styled.

129
00:08:23.826 --> 00:08:27.586
So we're going to go through
a big demo on that and

130
00:08:27.586 --> 00:08:31.184
this is one of the most
confusing parts of CSS.

131
00:08:31.184 --> 00:08:37.211
That is why that we need to think about
inheritance and specificity often together

132
00:08:37.211 --> 00:08:42.469
and this is where I think the root of
a lot of confusion in CSS comes from.

133
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:45.668
Because people don't understand,
I'm throwing ideas at it,

134
00:08:45.668 --> 00:08:47.513
I'm throwing bang important at it.

135
00:08:47.513 --> 00:08:51.454
And my paragraph is still
not styling the way I want.

136
00:08:51.454 --> 00:08:55.005
And so we're gonna re address that
particular issue here today as well.

137
00:08:55.005 --> 00:09:01.080
So, let's start Coding then with
a demonstration of how inheritance works.
