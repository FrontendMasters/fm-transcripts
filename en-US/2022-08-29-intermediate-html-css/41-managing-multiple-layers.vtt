1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.446
So we continue to have this stubborn
problem with the separate style sheets,

2
00:00:05.446 --> 00:00:09.719
where we have our standard style
sheet of unlayered styles,

3
00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.681
we have layered styles inside
of the addme style sheet.

4
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:18.626
Even if I were to do something like put
all of these styles that are here inside

5
00:00:18.626 --> 00:00:23.725
of my style.css, put them in a layered
style, we are still not gonna be able to

6
00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:28.856
get that addme style to come through as
long as it's in a separate style sheet.

7
00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:34.105
So what I'm going to do now is,
I'm gonna copy the addme.css,

8
00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:36.925
just highlight all of it and copy,

9
00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:42.003
make sure that that being important
is off of the color white.

10
00:00:42.003 --> 00:00:44.897
And we had added at one
point along the way.

11
00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:50.988
And I'm going to go scroll to the bottom
of my standard style sheet here.

12
00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:54.589
And I'm going to put in @layer addme,

13
00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:00.701
it's gonna still be the name,
we'll put in the double brackets,

14
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:05.631
and then I'll paste all of
my styles inside of addme.

15
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:09.560
And you'll notice that my errors here
in VSCode are gonna continue to add up.

16
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.853
These are all related to layers once
again, and VSCode doesn't know about them,

17
00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:18.316
that's why it's giving me
all these errors, okay.

18
00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:22.230
So now I have a layer inside of
the style sheet called addme.

19
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.273
What about all of these
styles that are unlayered?

20
00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:28.071
They are still gonna trump
anything inside of addme,

21
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:31.936
even though addme comes later in this
document according to the cascade.

22
00:01:31.936 --> 00:01:33.840
So what I'm going to do instead,

23
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.859
I'm going to get rid of this first
line of code here with the @import.

24
00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.564
I don't need it anymore because
I've just added those styles

25
00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:43.210
to the end of the document.

26
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.604
And I'm going to put in an @layer,
and I'm just gonna call this standard.

27
00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:53.940
These are my standard styles,
they're the ones that I started with.

28
00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.913
And I am going to wrap those curly
brackets around all the styles that I

29
00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:00.211
had previously.

30
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:03.071
So everything down to the layer of addme.

31
00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:05.762
So I've flattened the cascade in a sense,

32
00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:09.220
we no longer have unlayered
styles in this document.

33
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.386
Everything is inside of a layer,
we have a standard layer, and

34
00:02:12.386 --> 00:02:13.594
we have an addme layer.

35
00:02:13.594 --> 00:02:16.804
Right now,
because the addme styles come later,

36
00:02:16.804 --> 00:02:21.861
they are going to take priority, just
like they would inside of CSS normally.

37
00:02:21.861 --> 00:02:25.146
And if we open this up
in a default browser,

38
00:02:25.146 --> 00:02:30.918
you'll see that our text is white, so
that is another possible solution.

39
00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:36.071
But, we could also, what happens if,
for example, there are other things

40
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:40.983
in here that are conflicting with what
we have in our standard style and so

41
00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:44.950
we decide to put this addme
style earlier in the document.

42
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.781
So I put it before my standard styles,
and I drop it here, and save again.

43
00:02:51.781 --> 00:02:53.579
What color is that text?

44
00:02:55.826 --> 00:03:00.016
The pink declaration is gonna
come later in the document, so

45
00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:02.325
this is gonna show up pink again.

46
00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:04.459
All right, this is the last part of this.

47
00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.078
We can specify what layers we want to
have in the order we want them evaluated.

48
00:03:10.078 --> 00:03:13.173
So, now at the very top of the document,

49
00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:19.020
according to the spec this is where you
have to put it, we can say, @layer.

50
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.639
And then I can say, standard, addme;.

51
00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:30.588
So that is an indication to the browser
to evaluate the standard styles first and

52
00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:37.347
the addme styles second, even though
addme is coming first in the document.

53
00:03:37.347 --> 00:03:43.919
And so now when we save this and
we take a look at our web browser,

54
00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:49.760
and we refresh our page,
our style will be white again.

55
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.952
So I've just showed you a whole bunch of
different ways to solve these conflicts.

56
00:03:53.952 --> 00:03:59.708
Just to summarize once again, we have the
use of bang important, which I don't like.

57
00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:04.294
We can copy over one of our layered
styles into our unlayered style so

58
00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:05.831
that it takes effect.

59
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:08.102
And there's probably downsides to that.

60
00:04:08.102 --> 00:04:13.573
The other possible solution is to include
all of our styles in some kind of layer,

61
00:04:13.573 --> 00:04:16.880
and then indicate
the ordering of those layers.

62
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.295
If we needed to, now I had only kept
all of my addme styles together

63
00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:28.996
in a single layer, we could pull out that
one style and give it its own layer name.

64
00:04:28.996 --> 00:04:32.524
And I'll show you that
here just real quick.

65
00:04:32.524 --> 00:04:37.489
Let's just say that that color
white is the thing that's

66
00:04:37.489 --> 00:04:42.764
driving us bananas,
we could add a layer called difficult,

67
00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:48.160
because these are the styles
that are being difficult for us.

68
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.370
And we could then say we just
want figure a: any-link.

69
00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:01.681
And it's gonna have that color of white.

70
00:05:04.422 --> 00:05:07.241
So now it's broken out into
its own special layer.

71
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:12.259
We can then say that we addme first,
then we want our

72
00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.769
standard layer, and
then we want our difficult layer.

73
00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:22.718
So we can sort these in
whatever order you want.

74
00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:25.893
And if you wanna put the difficult
layer first before addme,

75
00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:27.395
you can totally do that too.

76
00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:31.356
This is the order in which
they will be evaluated.

77
00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:34.491
So now when I save my
style sheet again and

78
00:05:34.491 --> 00:05:39.854
I take a look at this inside of my
web browser, my text is still white.

79
00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:44.506
And that's because I have pulled out
that white color into its own layer.

80
00:05:44.506 --> 00:05:46.231
And I have the cascade set up so

81
00:05:46.231 --> 00:05:50.096
that that is coming last in my
document in a functional sort of way.

82
00:05:50.096 --> 00:05:54.767
So there's many possible solutions
now with layers that give us

83
00:05:54.767 --> 00:05:59.967
the flexibility of bringing in styles
from lots of different sources.

84
00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:03.601
Rewriting our CSS in a whole bunch
of different ways to make sure that

85
00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:06.740
the styling that we want is
applied in the way that we want.

86
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.002
While our brand is still preserved,
even though we're bringing in all kinds of

87
00:06:11.002 --> 00:06:14.132
different styles from all
kinds of different locations.

88
00:06:14.132 --> 00:06:17.521
Layers are really crazy,
they are brand new technology.

89
00:06:17.521 --> 00:06:20.959
I think we're gonna see people
start to explore these,

90
00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:25.429
we'll see more possibilities emerge
as people explore these further.

91
00:06:25.429 --> 00:06:27.211
So watch for blog posts and

92
00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:32.888
such that are gonna be coming out talking
more about this new layer specification.
