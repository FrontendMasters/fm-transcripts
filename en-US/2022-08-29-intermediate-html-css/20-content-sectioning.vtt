00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.730
In our website, we are in chapter 3,
which is hearts of the webpage.

2
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.146
And we just went through the slides
here on the page, and so

3
00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:13.124
now we are at part 1,
the content sectioning demo.

4
00:00:13.124 --> 00:00:16.107
So let's open up that beginning code pen.

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.810
And let's take a look at what's
going on here here, all right.

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.654
So first of all, since I don't have
any other use for the JavaScript box,

7
00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:29.382
down here in the JavaScript
box is one long comment,

8
00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:33.412
which has all of those elements and you
can refer to these as we think about what

9
00:00:33.412 --> 00:00:36.460
elements we should be putting
where on our page, okay?

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.850
So that is down there
in the JavaScript box.

11
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.130
We have some basic CSS styling, just so
we don't have to look at Times New Roman.

12
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.188
And now we are ready to mark up this page.

13
00:00:46.188 --> 00:00:51.240
So let us go through this.

14
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.413
So the first thing I always recommend
people to do is they start doing their

15
00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:59.040
markup, is to take a look at this and
do a quick read through.

16
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.110
And you can for the most part,
probably skim it.

17
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.707
So we can see here we have my Iceland
website, probably a title of the website,

18
00:01:06.707 --> 00:01:12.020
we have something that kind of looks like
a Navbar, that's probably what that is.

19
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.327
This is probably a subheading,
about Iceland, right?

20
00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:20.170
Then we have some information,
blah blah blah, we have some facts.

21
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.120
Kinda looks like Keys and properties
are keys and values, doesn't it?

22
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.280
Then we have some additional information,
Geography, Geology and Climate.

23
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.680
I will look at that, these
are spelled out in separate sections.

24
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.280
We have Geography, and then we have
Geology, and then we have Climate.

25
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.970
That might tell you something about
headings and that they're ordering their.

26
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.108
And then we have some information about
where this information came from,

27
00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:56.081
and then we have information about
this weird person Jen Kramer who might

28
00:01:56.081 --> 00:02:00.402
have compiled this information,
and we also have C also list,

29
00:02:00.402 --> 00:02:03.990
here's some other things
we might think about, and

30
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.660
here's some other information about
this being a demo for front end masters.

31
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.844
And here's their contact information
down here at the bottom.

32
00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:18.419
So a good way to start doing this is
just start by thinking about the kind of

33
00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:23.380
content that we have and let's play some
really big elements here on the page.

34
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.839
Shall we?

35
00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:25.789
Okay.

36
00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:30.153
So my Iceland website what
element might we assign that?

37
00:02:30.153 --> 00:02:31.852
&gt;&gt; H1.

38
00:02:31.852 --> 00:02:36.743
&gt;&gt; That's probably the H1 isn't it?

39
00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:37.243
Okay.

40
00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.069
Right?

41
00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.618
Straightforward enough,
what is the home about in contact?

42
00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:46.570
&gt;&gt; Nav?

43
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.440
&gt;&gt; Probably a Navbar.

44
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.679
So, as I tell people,
that starts with Nav,

45
00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:58.370
it ends with slash Nav but
it's an unordered list of links and

46
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.755
so another hill I will die on is that it
should be marked up as an unordered list.

47
00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:11.160
I know the trend is not to do that but
I am going to do it.

48
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.557
One of the great things about Navbar is I
could do an entire course here on Navbars

49
00:03:15.557 --> 00:03:17.050
and Navbar styling.

50
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.690
When you have this semantic markup,
you have all kinds of interesting elements

51
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.760
that you can grab on to for
styling your Navbar.

52
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.484
So a lot of people were like well it's
just extra markup but I'm here to tell you

53
00:03:30.484 --> 00:03:36.327
you can make use of that extra markup as
you style, so it's a good thing to have.

54
00:03:36.327 --> 00:03:38.318
So we have these allies.

55
00:03:43.538 --> 00:03:47.780
Okay, so there that is.

56
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.640
Now what are these two things
together H1 and the Navbar?

57
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.390
What might that be?

58
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.240
&gt;&gt; Header?

59
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.060
&gt;&gt; It's probably some kind of header for
the webpage right?

60
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.423
So we can put in I head around this.

61
00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:10.520
Okay, so
that's the first section of our webpage.

62
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.133
We have the name of the site,
and we have the navigation bar.

63
00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:18.805
Now we go down here underneath of this,
and

64
00:04:18.805 --> 00:04:24.130
we have a article here looks like right,
some kind of information about Iceland.

65
00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.070
And then we have all these facts and
we have background and geography and

66
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.930
geology and climate, so
it looks like some kind of article, right?

67
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.721
This is information that could
potentially stand alone.

68
00:04:36.834 --> 00:04:42.036
So we'll mark it up as such,
it is an article.

69
00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:45.527
It starts about there at about Iceland.

70
00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:49.220
And as we scroll down the page.

71
00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:55.101
Geology, Climate that we have
this information here about where

72
00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:56.809
the information came from,

73
00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:01.020
we have information about who compiled
it we also have related links.

74
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.817
Okay, so potentially our

75
00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:12.100
article is ending here right?

76
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.175
Because this part down here at
the bottom where it has the address and

77
00:05:16.175 --> 00:05:20.984
the links that are down here in the bottom
for social media, what might that be?

78
00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:22.419
&gt;&gt; Footer?

79
00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.215
&gt;&gt; This might be a footer, right?

80
00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:30.579
This might be a web page footer.

81
00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:36.848
Okay?

82
00:05:36.848 --> 00:05:42.500
And so let's think a little bit more about
the detail here inside of this footer.

83
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.560
We have this contact information here.

84
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.462
How might we mark that up?

85
00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:50.522
&gt;&gt; An address element.

86
00:05:50.522 --> 00:05:52.988
&gt;&gt; This might be an address element here,
right?

87
00:05:55.138 --> 00:05:56.740
So make this a little bit bigger.

88
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.709
So this might be an address element.

89
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:06.464
This is contact information for
Frontend Masters.

90
00:06:06.464 --> 00:06:12.033
Now, This brings

91
00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:16.640
to mind another element, that is a perfect
place to use this particular element.

92
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.946
The BR element line breaks,

93
00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:24.630
one of the most misunderstood
elements that are out there in HTML.

94
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.154
So, currently the way
the page is displaying,

95
00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:33.678
is like these,
its just fronting master yellow

96
00:06:33.678 --> 00:06:39.236
c60z63sweet3625, its all in one line,
right?

97
00:06:39.236 --> 00:06:41.995
And no mater what country you are in,

98
00:06:41.995 --> 00:06:46.001
postal addresses have some
kind of fixed formating.

99
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:51.024
When the formating content is critical
addresses are a great example,

100
00:06:51.024 --> 00:06:55.030
a poem is another really
good example of that.

101
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.490
The BR element is absolutely appropriate.

102
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.130
If you're putting in the BR just to
make things show up on one line or

103
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.510
single spacing, then that's not
the right reason to use it.

104
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.660
You got to be using CSS to do that.

105
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.053
But here we need to communicate
the meaning that front end masters has

106
00:07:11.053 --> 00:07:15.000
a postal address in the United States and
this is the way we format it.

107
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.770
So in this case we will use BR.

108
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.919
So I'm gonna put it after the name
of the company, after their street,

109
00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.530
after their suite, after the city state.

110
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.150
After the email, which you're welcome
to mark up as a link if you wish.

111
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:37.563
After their Twitter,
maybe not after their Facebook,

112
00:07:37.563 --> 00:07:42.010
all of that is going to be our address.

113
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.962
And when we're done there, it should
look more like an address, right?

114
00:07:46.962 --> 00:07:52.251
A little bit more like an address down
at the bottom of the page, make sense?

115
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:55.061
Okay.

116
00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:58.556
All right, so let's go back up
to the top of our article again

117
00:08:03.227 --> 00:08:05.020
About Iceland, what would that be?

118
00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:07.643
&gt;&gt; H2?

119
00:08:07.643 --> 00:08:09.810
&gt;&gt; Probably an H2, right?

120
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.652
Only there's some controversy about it
multiple H1's on a page Google will

121
00:08:14.652 --> 00:08:18.076
tell you that you can have
more than one H1 on the page,

122
00:08:18.076 --> 00:08:21.615
because Google is used to
consuming really crappy HTL.

123
00:08:21.615 --> 00:08:23.792
[LAUGH], okay?

124
00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:26.980
But that doesn't mean that we should
do it for that particular reason.

125
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.792
So generally speaking people put
one H1 per page which would mean

126
00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:33.727
that this must be our H2.

127
00:08:33.727 --> 00:08:38.034
We never want to skip levels,
do not use your headings for

128
00:08:38.034 --> 00:08:41.102
sizing the text that is why you have CSS.

129
00:08:41.102 --> 00:08:44.347
So CSS can make that
whatever size you want.

130
00:08:44.347 --> 00:08:48.670
But H2 is what we want
to convey semantically.

131
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.358
Okay.
Then we have probably what amounts to

132
00:08:51.358 --> 00:08:55.240
a paragraph of information,
blah, blah, about Iceland.

133
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.920
And I have a note here don't
forget the superscript.

134
00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.970
Yeah, square kilometers.

135
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.210
So there is a element for this too.

136
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.443
Sup, Because KM2

137
00:09:10.443 --> 00:09:14.319
is very different than KM squared yes?

138
00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:18.699
Yes, so again that's a meeting
you're trying to convey and so

139
00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:24.310
exponents in this case those are great
things for using with superscripts.

140
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:29.198
There's also I'm sure you're
shocked to know and SUB, right?

141
00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:32.945
For subscript in which
case that will go down.

142
00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:36.040
Useful for chemical formulas and such.

143
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:42.019
Okay, but in this case we want
superscript for this one.

144
00:09:44.186 --> 00:09:46.540
All right,
then we go on to our Iceland facts.

145
00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.370
What is this?

146
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.470
How should we mark this up?

147
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:51.210
&gt;&gt; That's it.

148
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.310
Derrick M, deal.

149
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.510
&gt;&gt; Could be a deal?

150
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.490
Yeah.

151
00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:00.756
What is the purpose of Iceland
facts here we're reading along,

152
00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:04.320
we go about Iceland,
we learn about Iceland.

153
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.840
Then we have these facts that sort of
appear here, they're kind of related but

154
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.111
and then we go on to the Etymology here.

155
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:16.554
Is that necessarily what you would expect
to be reading as we go down the page,

156
00:10:16.554 --> 00:10:17.660
as an article?

157
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.480
&gt;&gt; Either an H2 or
an H3 as a new content header.

158
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.458
&gt;&gt; It could certainly be an H3 for
the content header, sure.

159
00:10:31.037 --> 00:10:34.337
It could probably be a deal, right?

160
00:10:34.337 --> 00:10:37.590
Description list for this whole thing.

161
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:44.965
And, as you can pretty much guess,
we're gonna have DT's right?

162
00:10:44.965 --> 00:10:52.600
Around coordinates, and we'll have a DD
around the actual coordinates, right?

163
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.990
And I'm not going to put all of these and
just to in the interest of time.

164
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:00.215
So you have a bunch of those for
the anthem the capital and

165
00:11:00.215 --> 00:11:04.970
largest sitting in the official language,
but that whole unit of content.

166
00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:08.730
Is that a thing that belongs
right there on the page?

167
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.650
&gt;&gt; Someone suggested sidebar.

168
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.410
&gt;&gt; It is kind of a sidebar, isn't it?

169
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.120
Functionally speaking,
it's a kind of sidebar.

170
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:23.853
And so the appropriate element
here would be a side, okay?

171
00:11:23.853 --> 00:11:28.884
So aside is used when the information
is tangentially related

172
00:11:28.884 --> 00:11:34.781
to what's going on here on the page,
but it is not the focus of the page and

173
00:11:34.781 --> 00:11:38.937
it doesn't have to be read
in a certain order, so,

174
00:11:38.937 --> 00:11:43.310
pretty much the definition of a sidebar.

175
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.836
We could lose this aside and
still have a perfect meaning and

176
00:11:46.836 --> 00:11:51.500
understanding of this whole webpage,
so that is what the aside is for.

177
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:56.630
Functionally often we style these
sidebars, but we don't have to do that.

178
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.294
They could be styled right here in
line with the rest of the article,

179
00:11:59.294 --> 00:12:00.660
depending on what we did, right?

180
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:05.930
Okay.
So then we'll go on to etymology.

181
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:08.350
Is this more of the article probably.

182
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.475
Yeah?
So this is probably another H3.

183
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:19.150
Okay, then we have our
description of the etymology.

184
00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:21.990
Then we have this
interesting type of thing.

185
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:27.370
We have a Geography, Geology and
Climate, followed by geography.

186
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:33.326
How might we mark those two things up?,
&gt;&gt; Sounds

187
00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:35.740
like they want a list of
the sections beneath that.

188
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:37.960
So does that all become a giant list?

189
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:43.230
&gt;&gt; It kind of does sound like
a kind of that sort of thing.

190
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.815
I'm not sure I would mark it up as a list,
but

191
00:12:46.815 --> 00:12:49.994
I would definitely do something
like this is an H3, right?

192
00:12:49.994 --> 00:12:54.124
So we're gonna go into a whole big
thing where these things might be

193
00:12:54.124 --> 00:12:58.181
related Geography, Geology and
Climate, and then Geography,

194
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:00.630
you would wind up being an H4, right?

195
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:05.661
Because this is a subsection of that H3.

196
00:13:05.661 --> 00:13:09.600
And depending on you might even
put a section around this.

197
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.880
I could go either way on that.

198
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:17.917
It just sort of depends on
your philosophy I guess.

199
00:13:17.917 --> 00:13:21.129
I used to teach academically if
I had a student who did this I

200
00:13:21.129 --> 00:13:22.580
wouldn't mark them off.

201
00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.895
So if you wanted to do that and say
this is all related, remember related or

202
00:13:27.895 --> 00:13:32.698
syndicated this is just related
it's not syndicated you could put

203
00:13:32.698 --> 00:13:37.843
a section around that whole thing Okay, so

204
00:13:37.843 --> 00:13:44.744
there's our geography blah blah,
we have geology, what would this be?

205
00:13:44.744 --> 00:13:51.842
&gt;&gt; H4.
&gt;&gt; H4 Okay,

206
00:13:51.842 --> 00:13:55.563
and then we have climate, that's an H4.

207
00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:00.407
Great.

208
00:14:00.407 --> 00:14:07.510
Okay, let's come back to, under geology
we have this image that is here

209
00:14:12.152 --> 00:14:18.583
Okay, so we have our image There it is.

210
00:14:18.583 --> 00:14:20.077
It's a geyser.

211
00:14:20.077 --> 00:14:23.850
There's a sense here that there's
a caption that goes underneath of it.

212
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.140
&gt;&gt; Anybody is this a good way?

213
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.530
Should we just leave it like this?

214
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:28.770
Is there a better way to mark this up?

215
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:36.112
And if there's a better way to mark it up,
does anybody have a suggestion?

216
00:14:36.112 --> 00:14:38.860
&gt;&gt; There's that fig caption
people were using earlier.

217
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:44.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, maybe that fig caption thing,
maybe it's a figure right?

218
00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:44.910
Okay.

219
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.758
Basically anytime you have an image and
texts that are related to each other,

220
00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:52.380
you can make use of the figure tag, okay?

221
00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.352
So text that goes underneath the image
they're related to each other.

222
00:14:56.352 --> 00:14:59.217
And I want you to know,
before I put the code in,

223
00:14:59.217 --> 00:15:02.093
I want you to note
the treatment of the alt text.

224
00:15:02.093 --> 00:15:06.678
When we have a caption with it, one of
the things we tend to do as developers is

225
00:15:06.678 --> 00:15:10.416
we just say I have a caption
great that's the alt text done.

226
00:15:10.416 --> 00:15:15.054
But that is probably not the best way to
go about doing this, so the caption says

227
00:15:15.054 --> 00:15:19.780
this is the erupting geyser in this valley
the oldest known geyser in the world.

228
00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:24.428
The alt text says the photo
features blue sky with clouds and

229
00:15:24.428 --> 00:15:29.137
a rocky landscape with a geyser erupting
straight into the air in the middle.

230
00:15:29.137 --> 00:15:33.424
So the alt text should contain
the information that you as sighted users

231
00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:38.282
would get just by looking at that picture
all that stuff is kind of obvious to you,

232
00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:41.300
you probably don't even
like think those words.

233
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:45.451
The caption gives you additional
information about where this geyser is

234
00:15:45.451 --> 00:15:47.060
located.

235
00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.572
So for our non sighted friends, what we
wanna do then is we want to provide alt

236
00:15:51.572 --> 00:15:56.227
texts that will give the information that
the sighted user would take from that

237
00:15:56.227 --> 00:15:57.941
picture, is that helpful?

238
00:15:57.941 --> 00:16:02.646
That's how you would go about thinking
about those two things they're different.

239
00:16:02.646 --> 00:16:08.392
Okay.
So, we'll put figure around this.

240
00:16:11.827 --> 00:16:14.800
Just like that,
that groups those two things together.

241
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.467
The figure element is really versatile,
someone started to do something

242
00:16:18.467 --> 00:16:21.009
earlier where they had
a quote instead of an image,

243
00:16:21.009 --> 00:16:23.700
that is a legit thing to
do with figures as well.

244
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.870
I love it that somebody was doing that.

245
00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:29.380
But this is the most common way to
make use of the figure element,

246
00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.760
we have figure, the image, and
then we have the fig caption.

247
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.581
And fig caption, if you wish if you
had more to say here you could put in

248
00:16:39.581 --> 00:16:44.447
multiple paragraphs, or any other
markup that you want inside of that

249
00:16:44.447 --> 00:16:49.232
fig caption element if you have
a really really long caption that goes

250
00:16:49.232 --> 00:16:53.049
on forever like sometimes
you see in research papers.

251
00:16:53.049 --> 00:16:55.160
&gt;&gt; Can we see how that turned out?

252
00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:55.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

253
00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:02.986
How did that turn out, so
this is just our raw unstyled html, okay?

254
00:17:02.986 --> 00:17:07.864
So by default your figure will be indented
slightly off the edge of the page.

255
00:17:07.864 --> 00:17:12.438
It puts a little bit of I forgot
whether it's margin or padding,

256
00:17:12.438 --> 00:17:16.349
what are those two are on
the edge of the figure, okay?

257
00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:18.268
Obviously you can change that with CSS.

258
00:17:22.967 --> 00:17:28.436
Okay, so then going on here,
for figure and so forth.

259
00:17:28.436 --> 00:17:33.296
And then down here at the bottom
we have our citation, and

260
00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:38.775
we have this information is compiled
by and we also have a C also.

261
00:17:38.775 --> 00:17:42.435
So maybe it's appropriate to put
all of this inside of a footer.

262
00:17:45.018 --> 00:17:50.045
So this is the article footer,
as opposed to the footer for the webpage.

263
00:17:54.227 --> 00:17:55.047
Okay?

264
00:17:57.839 --> 00:18:02.339
So that footer element would go all
the way around all of our citations,

265
00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:06.772
the compiled by and the C also,
C also is probably just a paragraph.,

266
00:18:10.689 --> 00:18:14.096
Actually as I look at that maybe
that's actually a list, right?

267
00:18:14.096 --> 00:18:16.462
C also here's a list of links,

268
00:18:18.609 --> 00:18:24.119
URL/UL, and some LI's.

269
00:18:37.083 --> 00:18:37.953
Okay.

270
00:18:40.401 --> 00:18:43.866
This information here compiled by,

271
00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:48.229
might be my contact information
&gt;&gt; So address?

272
00:18:48.229 --> 00:18:49.311
&gt;&gt; Address.

273
00:18:54.459 --> 00:18:59.215
Notice that I don't include the words
compiled by inside of the address tag,

274
00:18:59.215 --> 00:19:02.801
the reason why is that address
should be strictly a contact

275
00:19:02.801 --> 00:19:06.315
information compiled by as
not contact information, so

276
00:19:06.315 --> 00:19:10.885
that's why we leave it outside of it
we can separate these by line breaks.

277
00:19:10.885 --> 00:19:15.261
Or if you wanted to do something else
you could do that also probably, but

278
00:19:15.261 --> 00:19:16.640
something like that.

279
00:19:18.947 --> 00:19:23.010
Okay, I think I've got most
everything here in place.

280
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:27.790
So you see that now I've got my
web page completely sectioned.

281
00:19:27.790 --> 00:19:31.370
I'm very clear on what it is
that I'm trying to communicate.

282
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.732
I have headings that make sense,
we start at the top,

283
00:19:34.732 --> 00:19:38.864
they get smaller in number to help
people navigate this webpage.

284
00:19:38.864 --> 00:19:43.680
We've got footers for the article,
we've got footers for the web page,

285
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.087
we've got a header for the web page,

286
00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:50.611
and we're ready to get out to go
forward and put CSS styling in place.
