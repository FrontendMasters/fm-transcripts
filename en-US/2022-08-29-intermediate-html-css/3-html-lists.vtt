1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.643
So let's move on here.

2
00:00:01.643 --> 00:00:04.946
We're gonna start out by
talking about the humble list.

3
00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:10.282
Last week on Twitter I asked people how
many kinds of lists there are in HTML.

4
00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:14.368
So I will ask you all here again,
how many kinds of HTML?

5
00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:17.941
We don't mean how many kinds
of tags like LI as a tag,

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:20.144
we mean how many kinds of lists.

7
00:00:20.144 --> 00:00:21.690
Anyone wanna take a guess at that?

8
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.359
Online or here in person, it's a number.

9
00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.742
How many, pardon?

10
00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:27.495
&gt;&gt; Two.

11
00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:29.497
&gt;&gt; Two.
&gt;&gt; Ordered list, unordered list.

12
00:00:29.497 --> 00:00:34.743
&gt;&gt; We have one vote for two, other votes?

13
00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:39.140
Concurrence, concurrence,
concurrence, okay.

14
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.710
Everybody in the class here is saying two.

15
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.015
How about online, how many kinds
of lists are we saying online?

16
00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:49.735
&gt;&gt; Three, three, two,
three, two three, two.

17
00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:55.015
&gt;&gt; There are four [LAUGH] there're four
in HTML that are content oriented,

18
00:00:55.015 --> 00:00:58.630
there're two that
are oriented towards forms.

19
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.984
And so briefly for
the ones that are oriented towards forms,

20
00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:04.098
there's one select element, okay?

21
00:01:04.098 --> 00:01:09.800
Write that drop down that comes down, it's
really ugly, that is technically a list.

22
00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.140
Also there's another one,
data list that you might be familiar with.

23
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.927
You associate data list with a blank
on the page like a text input and

24
00:01:18.927 --> 00:01:24.720
when you start typing, it'll match to
whatever is in that data list, okay?

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.136
So those are two on forums,
I'm not gonna talk about it at all but for

26
00:01:29.136 --> 00:01:34.344
the purpose of content four kinds of lists
and we're gonna go through them all.

27
00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:36.373
So the four kinds of lists are as follows.

28
00:01:36.373 --> 00:01:40.245
We have bulleted lists and
the number lists, ordered and

29
00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:45.420
unordered kinds of lists and those
are the ones you're most familiar with.

30
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.450
That's why you all said two
cuz you kinda know those two.

31
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.207
Description lists which are formally
called definition lists are for

32
00:01:53.207 --> 00:01:58.780
key value pairs, one of my favorite
HTML elements that are out there.

33
00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.320
Be willing to associate two pieces
of data together, super fun.

34
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.352
And then menus are so
called interactive lists.

35
00:02:06.352 --> 00:02:10.817
So if you are making a button bar,
button the element and

36
00:02:10.817 --> 00:02:13.763
you have a series of buttons on that.

37
00:02:13.763 --> 00:02:18.519
Maybe cut, copy and paste or maybe reply,
reply all, forward like an email

38
00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.147
kind of button group, this is the way
to mark it up is with the menu, okay?

39
00:02:23.147 --> 00:02:27.594
So not oriented towards text links but
oriented towards JavaScript buttons and

40
00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:30.976
we're gonna talk about all of
these in a little bit detail and

41
00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:33.180
we'll learn selectors along the way.

42
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.288
So with that let's code.

43
00:02:37.288 --> 00:02:42.148
If you're following along on the website,
this is semantics-selectors.css.education,

44
00:02:42.148 --> 00:02:45.850
this is the website that goes with
what we'll be covering today.

45
00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.460
If you wanna scroll on down here,
we have just finished chapter 1.

46
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.760
This is our overview and prerequisites.

47
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.899
We took a look at some slides and here's
just some background about what you're

48
00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.020
gonna need in order to take this course.

49
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.650
You can read on that on your own and test
to make sure that you have the right level

50
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.555
of HTML and CSS background and the kinds
of technologies that we'll be using today,

51
00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:07.210
that's all that's covered here.

52
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.828
All right, so let's go through them for
our lists and selectors,

53
00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:17.170
let us take a look at what
we have been missing.

54
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.967
So we're going to start with our
ordered and our unordered lists and

55
00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.130
we'll start here with our code pen.

56
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.652
So just briefly because I'm sure that
a lot of you remember this although hell,

57
00:03:29.652 --> 00:03:32.486
based on what I see from
Markup I don't know guys,

58
00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:34.798
that's why we're going through this.

59
00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:38.698
Unordered lists are just
designed to be a list of things.

60
00:03:38.698 --> 00:03:43.067
They can go in any order, you can do them
in any order, you can visit them in any

61
00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:46.983
order, there's no ranking implied,
it's just a group of things.

62
00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:50.101
And the way you mark those
up pretty straightforward.

63
00:03:50.101 --> 00:03:53.671
You start with ul for the unordered list,

64
00:03:53.671 --> 00:03:58.780
you end with slash ul and
there's a bunch of LIs in between.

65
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.546
All that stuff about list roles and
all of that happy thing,

66
00:04:01.546 --> 00:04:04.874
all that stuff is baked into this so
use it when you have a list of things.

67
00:04:04.874 --> 00:04:08.470
The next one is the ordered list.

68
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.430
Now the ordered list is kind of fun
because it has a few additions that

69
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.590
the unordered list does not have.

70
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.750
So here's a few attributes
you probably aren't aware of.

71
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.558
So ordered list of course implies
that you do this thing first and

72
00:04:20.558 --> 00:04:22.701
then you do this thing and
then you do this thing.

73
00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:26.680
So it's a list that goes
in a very specific order.

74
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.919
You start with number one, then you go to
number two or it could be like a ranking

75
00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.530
kind of thing, this is the first place,
this is the second place.

76
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.488
Because those numbers are significant
there are some attributes that

77
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:44.690
are associated with this that may
also be of a significance for you.

78
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:52.119
So one of these is if we said reversed,
okay?

79
00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:57.889
We said reversed, notice we can
just flip our numbers right around.

80
00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.271
So that's 3, 2 and 1 instead of 1,2 and 3.

81
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:06.707
Again, this applies when you put it in
your HTML as opposed to putting it in your

82
00:05:06.707 --> 00:05:07.528
CSS, right?

83
00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:11.715
Because of course you could do something
with reverse numbers, maybe in CSS or

84
00:05:11.715 --> 00:05:12.420
something.

85
00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.285
Here you're implying
that there is a reason,

86
00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:19.187
you're trying to communicate
something with these numbers.

87
00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:20.823
It's not just to look cool,

88
00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:24.855
it is you're actually communicating
meaning behind these numbers.

89
00:05:24.855 --> 00:05:27.649
So here we're putting the third
place finisher first,

90
00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:32.075
followed by the second place finisher,
followed by the first place finisher.

91
00:05:32.075 --> 00:05:34.865
That is the purpose of
the reversed attribute.

92
00:05:34.865 --> 00:05:36.275
How many people knew about that one?

93
00:05:37.915 --> 00:05:41.585
Nope, cool, super fun.

94
00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:48.676
Then we have start =, some number.

95
00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:51.712
So let's say we wanna
start at number 6 and.

96
00:05:55.828 --> 00:05:59.970
Then it will start numbering from
number 6 right there on the page.

97
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.452
So that is what that HTML looks like,
the start attribute and

98
00:06:03.452 --> 00:06:05.649
then you can put a number inside of it.

99
00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:07.946
It'll start numbering from there.

100
00:06:07.946 --> 00:06:11.491
I haven't tried to combine
that with reversed.

101
00:06:11.491 --> 00:06:16.323
Combine those, does that do a thing?

102
00:06:16.323 --> 00:06:19.407
Yeah, 6, 5, 4.

103
00:06:19.407 --> 00:06:23.755
So you can combine those two
attributes in order to start at some

104
00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:25.570
numbering go backwards.

105
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.790
And then the last one has to do with type.

106
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:38.373
type = something like this and
a would be for lower case letters.

107
00:06:38.373 --> 00:06:41.050
Oops, I got rid of my
closing bracket there.

108
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.191
That's why that first bullet didn't work,
okay?

109
00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:47.790
So a,b, c, right?

110
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:54.273
There's also the ability to do
Roman numerals, lowercase i.

111
00:06:57.748 --> 00:06:59.570
So we have i, ii, iii.

112
00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.190
So this type of numbering where it matters
whether these are Arabic numerals or

113
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.250
Roman numerals or letters,
that is important and things like law and

114
00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.170
government where you're referring
to certain sections of code,

115
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.990
this becomes a really
useful way of doing that.

116
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:19.984
And again, we're communicating
meaning because we're doing it through

117
00:07:19.984 --> 00:07:21.892
our HTML not our CSS, okay?

118
00:07:21.892 --> 00:07:25.570
And as it says right here in the note,
unless the type of the list number matters

119
00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:29.642
like legal or technical documents where
you're referencing their number or letter,

120
00:07:29.642 --> 00:07:31.612
use the CSS list style property instead.

121
00:07:31.612 --> 00:07:35.952
So that's how we differentiate those two,
doing it in the HTML doing it in the CSS,

122
00:07:35.952 --> 00:07:36.572
all right?

123
00:07:36.572 --> 00:07:41.451
And then the last one is the nested lists
and I'm sure that you all know this

124
00:07:41.451 --> 00:07:46.182
one also but the number one mistake
that I see is when I teach beginners.

125
00:07:46.182 --> 00:07:51.167
This is the first thing that I asked
them after we talk about lists

126
00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:55.409
is notice here on line 41 we
do not have an LI after this

127
00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:59.931
particular item because we
have list nested inside of it,

128
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:04.490
see how we have ol, li, li,
slash ol, and then slash li.

129
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:09.465
So the nested list needs to
be inside of a list item.

130
00:08:09.465 --> 00:08:16.976
Doing this thing where we say /li, and
then close our lists like this may or

131
00:08:16.976 --> 00:08:21.166
may not lead to the results that you want.

132
00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:25.882
It may render just fine but it may wind
up being weird things particularly

133
00:08:25.882 --> 00:08:29.225
when we get to styling with selectors and
so forth.

134
00:08:29.225 --> 00:08:32.196
And may lead to other weird
things happening again,

135
00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:35.639
when you get to mostly to advanced
styling types of things and

136
00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:40.316
who knows what every browser is going to
do when you markup your HTML incorrectly.

137
00:08:40.316 --> 00:08:42.413
So that's a few little tips there.

138
00:08:42.413 --> 00:08:46.170
You can always come back to this code
pattern if you want it here for reference

139
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.120
or fork it to your account even better and
then you'll have it to refer to later.
