00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.573
Continuing on here,
I'm just gonna comment out

2
00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:09.490
this particular style just so
it's not confusing.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.382
So the next thing I wanna talk about
is styling these individual list item

4
00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:15.110
markers.

5
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.449
So by default, as you know, when
you're working with an unordered list,

6
00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.251
you get bullets.

7
00:00:19.251 --> 00:00:24.017
When you're working with an ordered list
you, get Arabic numerals in order unless

8
00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:27.840
you apply some of those HTML
attributes that I discussed earlier.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.569
So it is possible, however,
to override all of those bullets.

10
00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:38.323
Some of these values are built into CSS,
some of them you can add to them.

11
00:00:38.323 --> 00:00:42.773
And so
let us set up our unordered list, and

12
00:00:42.773 --> 00:00:46.976
these are all inherited properties, so

13
00:00:46.976 --> 00:00:52.793
we can display a lot of things
here by this point in time.

14
00:00:52.793 --> 00:00:59.066
So I'm gonna say, let's put a border
on this 1px pixel solid red.

15
00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.480
That'll put a nice border around it so
you know what we're talking about.

16
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.758
We can put some padding on the top, 1rem,

17
00:01:07.758 --> 00:01:12.898
we can put padding on the bottom, 1rem.

18
00:01:12.898 --> 00:01:16.300
Okay, so that just gives us
a little bit of room there.

19
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.120
That is what we're looking at,
that first list at the top.

20
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.970
And then we go to list-style-type.

21
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.961
And there's a number of values for
this, one of which would be square.

22
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.870
That'll give you little squares.

23
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.804
Isn't that cute?

24
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.707
Also, there's a circle.

25
00:01:37.707 --> 00:01:40.218
Let's see.

26
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.944
Circle and a bunch of other
various types of colors here.

27
00:01:47.944 --> 00:01:51.183
As we saw earlier,
if we put a color on this,

28
00:01:51.183 --> 00:01:55.486
the list style will also take
on that color as well, okay?

29
00:01:55.486 --> 00:01:57.738
So those are the ones that are built-in.

30
00:01:57.738 --> 00:01:59.917
What if you wanted to
do something different?

31
00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:01.726
You absolutely can.

32
00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:07.919
For example,

33
00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:16.358
Mac people if you hit Ctrl or
Cmd+Ctrl+Space,

34
00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:20.659
you'll get your emoji
palette that comes up here.

35
00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.750
I am not sure how to do this on Windows.

36
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.044
Does anybody know how to pull
up an emoji palette on Windows?

37
00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:26.663
&gt;&gt; Windows+period.

38
00:02:26.663 --> 00:02:30.699
&gt;&gt; Windows+period pulls up
your palette on Windows.

39
00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:35.159
And let's say I want these
fantastic unicorns in

40
00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.435
front of all of my list style items.

41
00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:41.608
So you pick out any of your emojis,
and there they are.

42
00:02:44.462 --> 00:02:46.092
That's so awesome, isn't it?

43
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.895
Okay, so what would happen if
I started to combine these

44
00:02:53.895 --> 00:03:01.143
with other various types of the nth-child
selectors that we saw earlier?

45
00:03:01.143 --> 00:03:06.255
So add and I could say, for example,

46
00:03:06.255 --> 00:03:11.165
Maybe that's my default style type,

47
00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:15.614
and then I could say something like

48
00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:20.841
.unordered li:nth-child(3n).

49
00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:26.450
So every third one,
maybe I want my list-style-type,

50
00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:35.836
To be a rainbow.

51
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.262
So now, we have unicorns and
we have rainbows,

52
00:03:46.262 --> 00:03:50.648
and then we could then say .unordered

53
00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:55.096
li:nth-child, What?

54
00:03:55.096 --> 00:04:01.500
3n+2, exactly what we just said, right?

55
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.400
List-style-type would be something else.

56
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.060
Does anybody have a suggestion?

57
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.014
Maybe happy hearts.

58
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:17.298
Okay, so there we go.
Now,

59
00:04:17.298 --> 00:04:21.256
we have a list that is alternating
between unicorns, rainbows, and hearts.

60
00:04:24.201 --> 00:04:25.487
That's kind of fun.

61
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.486
And it's a pattern, right?

62
00:04:29.486 --> 00:04:32.091
So once again,
I haven't specifically assigned

63
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:35.882
each list item to have a specific emoji,
I've just assigned a pattern.

64
00:04:35.882 --> 00:04:39.432
And I've done that by,
we have the unordered style there,

65
00:04:39.432 --> 00:04:42.701
where the list-style-type
is a unicorn by default.

66
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:44.593
The other ones they come later and

67
00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:48.457
also have higher specificity in
addition to working with cascade.

68
00:04:48.457 --> 00:04:52.628
They have list-style-types
of different emoji, and

69
00:04:52.628 --> 00:04:59.025
they are utilizing the nth-child selector
here to do a slightly different pattern.

70
00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:02.962
So now, we've offset these so that we get,
in this case, unicorn, heart,

71
00:05:02.962 --> 00:05:06.550
rainbow, unicorn, heart, rainbow,
unicorn, heart, rainbow.

72
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.150
All right, so let's go to the last
unordered list that I have here.

73
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.855
And for this one, I wanna do
something a little bit different.

74
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:20.478
I wanna use some SVGs for
my list numbers here.

75
00:05:20.478 --> 00:05:23.330
And so to do that,

76
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.235
I'm gonna go to fontawesome.com.

77
00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:32.383
Because this is where there's some SVGs,
and

78
00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:36.512
we don't really care a lot about
where these SVGs come from.

79
00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:41.120
So Font Awesome is just a great
place to go get an SVG.

80
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.955
For trying something out,
we're gonna use the free ones.

81
00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:47.925
And then from here,
you can pick something that you enjoy.

82
00:05:47.925 --> 00:05:50.033
Let's say we want a shrimp.

83
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.826
Because when else are you gonna
get to use a shrimp icon, right?

84
00:05:55.826 --> 00:05:59.490
Never are you gonna use a shrimp
SVG anywhere in your work.

85
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.180
So let's say we wanna use this one here.

86
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.272
And if you roll your mouse over the icon
that looks like a little HTML guy here,

87
00:06:08.272 --> 00:06:10.350
it'll say Copy SVG code.

88
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.656
Let's copy that so
that you've got that on your clipboard.

89
00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:18.498
So the way we're gonna set this one up.

90
00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.086
So notice that in our last list here,
we have some ordered bullet points here.

91
00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:31.347
We don't wanna select those,
those are ordered bullet points,

92
00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:33.836
we really want those numbers to show.

93
00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:37.726
So I just wanna select
the unordered list items.

94
00:06:37.726 --> 00:06:39.985
So I'm going to say from my selector,
what?

95
00:06:39.985 --> 00:06:43.125
We're gonna say .nested.

96
00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:44.038
And then what?

97
00:06:47.444 --> 00:06:49.545
&gt;&gt; Unordered list items ul li.

98
00:06:49.545 --> 00:06:55.312
&gt;&gt; Right,
nested the direct children of nested.

99
00:06:55.312 --> 00:07:00.365
So that we will get just the li's that are
associated with the unordered bullets but

100
00:07:00.365 --> 00:07:02.470
not the ordered bullets, right?

101
00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.784
And then I'm gonna introduce
you to a new sort of element,

102
00:07:06.784 --> 00:07:10.580
which is called marker,
and marker is super cool.

103
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:16.392
Marker is designed for, once again,
selecting specific list items and

104
00:07:16.392 --> 00:07:21.740
changing the marker, which is
the bullet that comes before them.

105
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.933
So here, we can do something
very cool with SVGs then.

106
00:07:25.933 --> 00:07:32.273
And what we're going
to say is content:url.

107
00:07:34.593 --> 00:07:39.644
And then inside of this,
we're gonna paste in that

108
00:07:39.644 --> 00:07:44.351
whole thing here that
comes from Font Awesome,

109
00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:50.940
Along with, I had some other

110
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.747
things that came before that
SVG tag here in my notes.

111
00:07:55.747 --> 00:08:01.042
What comes before that in my notes here is

112
00:08:01.042 --> 00:08:10.306
data:image/svg+xml; Charset =,

113
00:08:13.587 --> 00:08:19.683
UTF-8, Comma.

114
00:08:19.683 --> 00:08:22.006
And then our SVG, that fills in here.

115
00:08:22.006 --> 00:08:26.902
And you'll see that we have
a viewBox associated with that.

116
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.317
But there's a couple of other
properties that we can put in here for

117
00:08:33.317 --> 00:08:35.290
our SVG that will make it show.

118
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:39.040
So you can see here that we have
now gotten rid of those bullets.

119
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.761
So we've selected the right thing,
but our SVG isn't showing,

120
00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:44.190
how can we get it to show?

121
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.990
We're going to add a couple
of additional properties.

122
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.407
So what I'm going to
add to this is a width,

123
00:08:54.769 --> 00:08:59.178
Of, 30.

124
00:08:59.178 --> 00:09:03.359
By the way, pro tip, you need to make sure
you're managing your single quotes and

125
00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:04.459
your double quotes.

126
00:09:04.459 --> 00:09:07.180
You probably know this from
other areas of programming.

127
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:12.300
But just make sure that that is in place
because otherwise this will not work well.

128
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:14.385
So just by putting in the width of 30,

129
00:09:14.385 --> 00:09:17.435
you wind up getting your little
shrimpies in place here.

130
00:09:17.435 --> 00:09:23.038
We can, if you wish,
also set a height, Of,

131
00:09:23.038 --> 00:09:29.358
I don't know, let's say 20, Okay,
if you want them a little bit smaller.

132
00:09:29.358 --> 00:09:34.395
And then you can also set your
fill of something like hotpink.

133
00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.160
And now, you have little pink
shrimpies in front of all of [LAUGH]

134
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.480
your bulleted items, okay?

135
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.069
Maybe that's something that
you wanna do with shrimp, but

136
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:49.511
maybe you have your company logo that
you'd like to put in front of list items.

137
00:09:49.511 --> 00:09:53.225
Maybe you have a whole bunch of PDFs.

138
00:09:53.225 --> 00:09:57.700
You can put your PDF icon in front
of all those particular list items.

139
00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.341
Anything that is an SVG,

140
00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:04.357
you can wind up getting it to work this
way using this list marker technique.
