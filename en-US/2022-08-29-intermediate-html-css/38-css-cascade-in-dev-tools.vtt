00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.621
Your browser's dev tools
are incredibly useful for

2
00:00:03.621 --> 00:00:07.082
visualizing how exactly
the cascade is working.

3
00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:11.473
So I know you have experience with
dev tools, you've used them before.

4
00:00:11.473 --> 00:00:15.691
But you may not realize what you're
looking at when you track down

5
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:17.307
styling with dev tools.

6
00:00:17.307 --> 00:00:21.954
So what I'd like to show you now is how
this winds up working when you were

7
00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:25.370
looking at, in this case,
somebody else's code.

8
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.419
We put it into dev tools and
we can see the cascade in action.

9
00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.140
Where we're going to focus
is on this purple line here,

10
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.827
which says a tree needs to be your
friend if you're going to paint him.

11
00:00:37.827 --> 00:00:41.544
And of course,
you can refer to the HTML and

12
00:00:41.544 --> 00:00:46.198
CSS here,
these are the files that come from GitHub.

13
00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:52.891
And you can see that on line 25 in
the HTML, we have a strong element.

14
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.831
It has a class of tree,
it has an inline style associated with it.

15
00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:02.091
There's also styles over here in
the external style sheet that are also

16
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:04.156
affecting this particular item.

17
00:01:04.156 --> 00:01:08.130
And while we can read the CSS and
eventually figure out what's going on,

18
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.689
dev tools are much faster and
way more visual.

19
00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.743
So let's dig into that now.

20
00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:18.005
I am using Firefox, you are welcome to
use Chrome or any of the other browsers

21
00:01:18.005 --> 00:01:22.015
with their browser tools,
you'll find similar types of tools there.

22
00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:25.368
So I am going to visualize this.

23
00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:30.048
I'm gonna to visualize this here in
Firefox by going to Tools &gt; Browser Tools

24
00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:31.564
&gt; Web Developer Tools.

25
00:01:31.564 --> 00:01:37.471
I have my developer tools configured to
show up on the left side of the screen.

26
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:41.571
You may have your own developer tools
configured to show up somewhere else.

27
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:47.647
And I am just gonna make them
a little bit bigger here.

28
00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:51.169
So we're gonna track down,
first of all, through the HTML,

29
00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:53.490
the target that we want to investigate.

30
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.685
So here in our developer tools,
it's gonna be inside of the body.

31
00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.493
Of course, the blue shading helps
you figure out where you are.

32
00:02:01.493 --> 00:02:06.817
It's not the h1, not the paragraph, not
the paragraph, it's the third paragraph.

33
00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:08.931
And then we wanna take a look at the tree.

34
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.187
And I'm going to click on that.

35
00:02:11.187 --> 00:02:15.532
And when I click on that
particular HTML element,

36
00:02:15.532 --> 00:02:21.222
you will see in your CSS window that
we have a whole series of styles

37
00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:27.032
that start all the way down here
from the very bottom of the screen.

38
00:02:27.032 --> 00:02:31.716
The very bottom of the screen is
our root declaration, that is,

39
00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:37.555
our colors that we have that we may be
using inside of this particular document.

40
00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:42.257
And as you see here, it says that
those are inherited from HTML.

41
00:02:42.257 --> 00:02:46.387
HTML is the root element
in an HTML document, and so

42
00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:50.627
that is what root is selecting
here in this context.

43
00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:55.928
Then we have inherited from body,
and you'll see here that the body

44
00:02:55.928 --> 00:03:00.860
is set to be trebuchet with
the line-height and a font-size.

45
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.712
But our font family has a line going
through it, which indicates that

46
00:03:05.712 --> 00:03:10.994
somewhere later in our document,
we have overwritten this along the way.

47
00:03:10.994 --> 00:03:17.129
So while our line-height and our font-size
are continuing to inherit from the body,

48
00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.502
we've overwritten that
font family later on.

49
00:03:20.502 --> 00:03:25.702
Then we're going to go through,
all of the next group of styles here

50
00:03:25.702 --> 00:03:30.733
are all coming from somewhere
inside of the author environment.

51
00:03:30.733 --> 00:03:35.060
And so these are sorted in order of
specificity as you can see here.

52
00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.112
We start with our border-box declaration,

53
00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:42.931
which has the universal selector,
has no specificity, and before and

54
00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:48.007
after, which are pseudo elements,
so they have a specificity of 001.

55
00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:52.611
We then go to our strong element,
just a plain old element 001.

56
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:55.558
It had a color of pink, but
that's been overwritten.

57
00:03:55.558 --> 00:03:56.564
As you can see,

58
00:03:56.564 --> 00:04:01.376
it was overwritten by tree, tree,
which has a higher specificity here.

59
00:04:01.376 --> 00:04:08.025
To this, we have added display block and
we are displaying it in purple.

60
00:04:08.025 --> 00:04:15.271
Then we're going on to a very specific
selector, p:nth-of-type(3) strong.

61
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:18.165
We've told it to display as normal.

62
00:04:18.165 --> 00:04:22.391
But then, inside of the element
that comes the last part here,

63
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:26.479
as you see over on the side,
it indicates that we are in line.

64
00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.541
This is an inline style.

65
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:32.854
Inline styles are gonna beat anything
that's coming from the external style

66
00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:34.388
sheet or what is embedded.

67
00:04:34.388 --> 00:04:40.968
And so there are p:nth-of-type(3)
strong with a font weight of normal.

68
00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:44.881
It's beaten then by an inline style,
which, in this case,

69
00:04:44.881 --> 00:04:46.659
says bold bang important.

70
00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:51.545
So it's going to override that, and
the font family is also located here.

71
00:04:51.545 --> 00:04:56.315
So that is why a tree needs to be your
friend if you're going to paint him.

72
00:04:56.315 --> 00:05:01.842
It's in fact, Georgia, it's bold, it's
display blocks, so it's on its own line.

73
00:05:01.842 --> 00:05:06.841
It has a color of purple, and
it's displaying as a border-box

74
00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:11.764
with a line-height of 1.5 and
a font-size of 1.2rem.

75
00:05:11.764 --> 00:05:16.425
Basically, we have to go through
this document and we have to add up

76
00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:21.188
all of those styles distributed
over all of those different rules.

77
00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:25.971
To finally come up with and
create the style that

78
00:05:25.971 --> 00:05:30.525
is displayed here inside
of the web browser.

79
00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:34.165
This is a relatively straightforward
example of how this works.

80
00:05:34.165 --> 00:05:37.027
The more external style sheets you have,

81
00:05:37.027 --> 00:05:41.769
the more inline styles you have,
the more embedded styles you have,

82
00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:45.467
the more complicated this
process may wind up being.

83
00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:48.741
But your browser is showing you here,

84
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:52.539
inside of your CSS window,
all of its work.

85
00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.972
It's showing you all of
the math that it's doing and

86
00:05:55.972 --> 00:05:59.888
it is showing you why what is
winning happens to be winning.

87
00:05:59.888 --> 00:06:04.690
And it's not necessarily a single
style rule by itself that wins,

88
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.494
it's parts of many different style
rules that add together to give

89
00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.430
you this final look here on the webpage.
