00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.588
So I've talked for
long enough, it is time now for

2
00:00:02.588 --> 00:00:05.734
you to put to use all of the things
that we've just talked about.

3
00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:11.470
We've talked about our unordered, ordered,
and description lists as well as menus.

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.283
We've also talked about all kinds of
different selectors, and so now I'm going

5
00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:20.910
to give you a page and invite you to mark
it up, and do a little styling with it.

6
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.515
So if you take it look at
the end of chapter two, and

7
00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:25.203
then you try it list challenge.

8
00:00:25.203 --> 00:00:29.298
We're gonna start here at
the beginning code pen, and

9
00:00:29.298 --> 00:00:32.155
here is how you should approach this.

10
00:00:32.155 --> 00:00:35.414
So, I have given you here a recipe for

11
00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:40.473
ice cream that comes from a book
from a hundred years ago.

12
00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:44.538
And you'll see here you'll
have to read the content and

13
00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:48.770
think about what kind of
markup would go with this.

14
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.522
And we have an image that's here in place,
where we have preparation instructions,

15
00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:56.360
we have instructions for
freezing, and so forth.

16
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.090
And then down at the bottom we have
a citation for where we got the recipe and

17
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.632
where we got the image.

18
00:01:02.632 --> 00:01:08.000
So this is two steps, here's how
you approach this kinda problems.

19
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.657
So the first thing I want you to do,
is to run through and then mark it up

20
00:01:11.657 --> 00:01:17.000
as semantically as you can, don't worry
about how it looks, just doesn't matter.

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.599
Think about what you wanna convey for
that meaning and

22
00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:23.189
assume that there's an h1 elsewhere
on the page for your site identity.

23
00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.142
In other words you're gonna start
your headings numbering from h2,

24
00:01:27.142 --> 00:01:30.560
because usually the h1 is gonna
be located somewhere else.

25
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.197
Once you've got your markup in place and
you're happy with it, okay, so

26
00:01:34.197 --> 00:01:36.954
in other words you have to
read that content, you have to

27
00:01:36.954 --> 00:01:40.670
think hard about the markup, then
you're gonna go on to your CSS styling.

28
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.338
And what I recommend is,
if you take that image and

29
00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:49.297
you put it through a site like
Adobe Color, and if you go to that

30
00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:53.830
URL there in the comment,
it'll give you some colors to work with.

31
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.822
So if you are color challenged as I am,

32
00:01:55.822 --> 00:02:00.480
usually if you start from a great image
it'll generate a color palette for you.

33
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.823
And then you can choose some Google fonts
or use standard fonts, and style up

34
00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:11.350
the rest of the page to make it look
attractive by whatever your definition is.

35
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.050
I'm gonna leave it very open-ended,
and not ask you to recreate something.

36
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.192
Let's break it into two parts.

37
00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:20.508
Let's give you 15 minutes,
to work on the markup, okay?

38
00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:23.822
So just focus on the markup for
this first 15 minutes.

39
00:02:23.822 --> 00:02:26.914
And then I'll come back and
we'll go through the markup answer.

40
00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:30.931
And then I'll give you a little bit more
time to work on some styling, sound good?
