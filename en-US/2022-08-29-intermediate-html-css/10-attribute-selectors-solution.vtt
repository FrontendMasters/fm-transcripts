00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.964
How'd you guys deal with that?

2
00:00:01.964 --> 00:00:09.031
Good, somebody wanna tell me what do you
did, tell me what I should type in here.

3
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:10.729
&gt;&gt; So I did href.

4
00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:11.984
&gt;&gt; Okay, so href.

5
00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:16.851
&gt;&gt; Yep and
the dollar sign $= string of ".pdf".

6
00:00:16.851 --> 00:00:18.864
&gt;&gt; ".pdf".

7
00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:25.680
&gt;&gt; To select all the links that end in
a pdf, and then I did the ::after, okay?

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.376
And did an attribute of content
with space pdf, as a string.

9
00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.706
&gt;&gt; Yeah, kind of like that?

10
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.959
Yeah, did it work?

11
00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:52.487
Yeah it did, totally did,
here it is right here, terms and

12
00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:57.141
conditions PDF,
privacy policy, PDF, right?

13
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.738
If you didn't get that far,
you could always do.

14
00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:09.302
By the way for your CSS debugging
purposes, I thoroughly encourage

15
00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:14.538
you can start with href,
something like *=, ".pdf".

16
00:01:14.538 --> 00:01:17.994
There's a PDF in there somewhere, right?

17
00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:24.054
And then you could say something
like color: pink, Okay?

18
00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:29.445
Let's make it totally not readable
very accessible, so there we go.

19
00:01:29.445 --> 00:01:33.071
Now you at least know that you're
on the right track okay so yes,

20
00:01:33.071 --> 00:01:34.898
my attribute selector worked.

21
00:01:34.898 --> 00:01:39.300
I'm selecting something that selects
links that have the PDF on it.

22
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.654
Then you can always up to another level,

23
00:01:41.654 --> 00:01:44.570
so here we've put in
the double colon ::after.

24
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.466
That's a pseudo-element that
says after that element,

25
00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:51.495
we're gonna add this
content string of PDF.

26
00:01:51.495 --> 00:01:53.227
Other things you can do here,

27
00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:56.358
I'm gonna point out some
stuff a little bit later on.

28
00:01:56.358 --> 00:02:01.260
As we get into formatting list items, you
might be able to do something with an SVG.

29
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.769
If you really want the little PDF icon,
maybe you have an SVG of it,

30
00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:07.290
that would be something
you could put in there.

31
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.850
Or you can put in a background image.

32
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.929
So you can put in a little
bit of padding and

33
00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.553
then have a background image
appear down at the end.

34
00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:16.715
It's the way we used to
do it in the old days.

35
00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:21.370
So, this is a great way
particularly if you're working in

36
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.551
government universities
who just love their PDFs.

37
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:27.018
Just put this in the code, and

38
00:02:27.018 --> 00:02:31.620
then they won't have to worry about
putting in those PDFs ever again, PDF.

39
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.176
So, notice that Dan had the dollar sign

40
00:02:36.176 --> 00:02:40.741
the ending substring, totally cool.

41
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:45.487
I just use my usual star equals for
mine because I can never remember

42
00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:49.824
[LAUGH] whether it's the beginning or
the ending substring.

43
00:02:49.824 --> 00:02:54.228
So you can be as particular
as you want on those.
