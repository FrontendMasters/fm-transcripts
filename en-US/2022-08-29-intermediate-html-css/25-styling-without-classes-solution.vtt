00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.392
I hope you all had fun with that,
does anyone have a code pin they wanna

2
00:00:05.392 --> 00:00:10.999
share to see could you manage to get
the styling done without any classes?

3
00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.093
If you do go ahead and
drop it in that window here and

4
00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:17.932
I will go through what I have done.

5
00:00:17.932 --> 00:00:22.490
So I was so excited to find out
there was a Trex and a gecko emoji.

6
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.183
So I threw those in here in my code bin
they're right there inside of my h1 and

7
00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:35.230
I think that those were the major
additions that I have here.

8
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.933
What I did do was I put the hours as its
own little thing here on the side and

9
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.450
I put it next to about the cafe.

10
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.486
And so
to make that happen I had to put a div, so

11
00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:52.056
put a div around after main but
before article, and

12
00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:59.940
that would include then the article
about the cafe, all of that information.

13
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.775
And it includes the section
here that I have for hours and

14
00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:08.588
potentially that could also be an aside
that might be a better choice of

15
00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:12.160
item because these are all
next to each other.

16
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.254
I think I just laid this out with
Flexbox if I remember correctly,

17
00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:17.676
well maybe I didn't.

18
00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:23.270
&gt;&gt; Read grid section just above there, so
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

19
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.850
&gt;&gt; Grid template columns.

20
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Grid.

21
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there it is.

22
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.950
Yeah, so I did it with grid.

23
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.820
Yeah, thank you.

24
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.320
So, the article is slightly bigger
than this hours over here on the side.

25
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.823
And then, down here in the menu, so,

26
00:01:41.823 --> 00:01:47.000
what the menu being sort of
the main attraction of all this.

27
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.958
I've got some stuff going on here
that's similar to that trick

28
00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:57.006
that I just showed you with
the unordered list and columns here,

29
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:02.360
I'm doing it with dt, so if there
is at least a fourth, nth of type.

30
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.690
Which would mean that
let's find that HTML here.

31
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.870
So we're looking for the fourth dt,

32
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.050
so here in this definition list
that's inside of the article.

33
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.930
Here's one, and then here's two,
here's three, and here's four.

34
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.690
So once you get to that, then I want
you to make two columns for me.

35
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.830
And went ahead and did that and
assign them accordingly like this.

36
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.513
If you're wondering about how I separated
the title of the menu item from the price,

37
00:02:37.513 --> 00:02:42.250
the way I wound up doing that,
right here is the big salad on line 70.

38
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.872
So I use span tags around these,
okay, so that's all inside of the dt,

39
00:02:47.872 --> 00:02:52.990
but I put span tags around,
in this case, big salad and $12.

40
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.392
And then you can use the article dt
becomes displaying as Flexbox, right?

41
00:02:59.392 --> 00:03:04.001
And put all the space in between that
which sends those two elements to either

42
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.730
side here.

43
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.930
And then you can assign the the other
various kinds of styling to this and

44
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.349
then put a border bottom on
the whole thing to sort of visually

45
00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.570
connect the name of
the item with the price.

46
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.362
So that's that little line
that goes underneath of that.

47
00:03:20.362 --> 00:03:24.726
So that's how I made that cute
little trick there happen,

48
00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:29.625
I think everything else more or
less is pretty straightforward in

49
00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:34.630
terms of the styling that was sort
of the big trick that I did there.

50
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.619
If anybody has any questions or

51
00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.943
want me to talk through any of the CSS
that's here on the page, let me know.

52
00:03:43.697 --> 00:03:50.092
Okay, Ben has got some styles
here to show us, thank you, Ben.

53
00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:55.340
He copied and
pasted a few things from earlier, [LAUGH].

54
00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.010
Setting the bar low, so
he liked the menu that we made earlier for

55
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.138
the navbar so he stole that styling there.

56
00:04:03.138 --> 00:04:08.154
He just hasn't taking out the bullets and
making it go horizontal yet

57
00:04:08.154 --> 00:04:13.990
so they sort of overlap each other but
he's got at least part of it there.

58
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.420
He's got the hours here
next to each other, right?

59
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.078
All the hours are next to each other, and
he did a different formatting here for

60
00:04:23.078 --> 00:04:24.740
his menu, I think this is great.

61
00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.628
So here, we've got the Kaji burger
$15 with the description next to it,

62
00:04:28.628 --> 00:04:30.040
that's totally awesome.

63
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.233
What a wonderful way to go about
formatting your menu down in a list

64
00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:35.004
like that.

65
00:04:35.004 --> 00:04:39.494
He could then add to this the concept
of those columns right, put those

66
00:04:39.494 --> 00:04:44.440
two things side by side using the hash
selector that we talked about earlier,

67
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.950
that would be a fun thing to do.

68
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.929
And you could probably use the hash
selector conditionally there also to

69
00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:54.730
say it's the last one on the column.

70
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.926
Maybe there's some way that we could write
some CSS to do that if it's the last one

71
00:04:57.926 --> 00:04:59.990
on the column not have the border there.

72
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.969
I'd have to give that one some thought but

73
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:05.716
that might be something that you might
think about seeing if you could do that.

74
00:05:07.828 --> 00:05:12.048
Yeah, the only disadvantage here
is this little snag right here, so

75
00:05:12.048 --> 00:05:14.249
we have the chocolate cake is $8.

76
00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.718
We have a description and then we
have the with the ice cream is $12,

77
00:05:19.718 --> 00:05:25.852
I don't know I guess I've seen menus
formatted this way before that's okay.

78
00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:28.552
If you wanted it show up over here
you'd have to do something a little bit

79
00:05:28.552 --> 00:05:30.267
different in order to
make make that happen.

80
00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:35.010
So didn't quite get through all of it but
I think you've got the great bones there

81
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.755
nicely done you concentrated on layout
problems and so I think that's awesome,

82
00:05:39.755 --> 00:05:40.262
good job
