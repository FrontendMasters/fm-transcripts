00:00:00.378 --> 00:00:02.221
So if we shorten this up a little bit,

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:06.322
it's going to look like this first of all
think about the relevance because most of

3
00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:10.259
your stylesheet isn't going to apply
to the thing you're trying to analyze.

4
00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.373
Then we want to look at origin and
importance.

5
00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:14.665
Where's it coming from?

6
00:00:14.665 --> 00:00:17.351
Does it have a bank important after it?

7
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:21.071
We want to take a look at the specificity
and analyze that, that would be

8
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:25.481
calculating those numbers that's going to
help tell us which one is most specific.

9
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:29.793
And then, the last one is the order
of appearance that applies when

10
00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:31.567
the specificity is equal.

11
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:38.932
Okay, so here's a few little odd
wrinkles as we think about this,

12
00:00:38.932 --> 00:00:45.098
the cascade algorithm is applied,
but for the specificity algorithm.

13
00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:48.962
So if we look at early in
the process of the cascade, and

14
00:00:48.962 --> 00:00:52.574
we have two styles here,
the Browser stylesheet,

15
00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:56.949
let's say it has root,
which of course is a pseudo class h1.

16
00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:03.195
And the Author stylesheet says h1 and
we have two different styles here for

17
00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:07.175
the border,
which one of these is going to win?

18
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:12.574
Well, even though the browser stylesheet
has a more specific selector,

19
00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:16.840
the author style sheet wins
because in terms of the Cascade

20
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.386
the browser style sheet comes
before the author style sheet.

21
00:01:21.386 --> 00:01:24.214
At a normal level of importance, so

22
00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:29.794
all that probably looks odd to you but
it is the way that this will work.

23
00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:35.590
So if we ignore layers for the moment and
I, We'll be coming back to those,

24
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.011
let's look at exactly how this
cascade is going to work.

25
00:01:40.011 --> 00:01:43.452
So the least important
things show up at the top.

26
00:01:43.452 --> 00:01:45.767
The most important ones
show at the bottom.

27
00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:50.660
We start with the styles that come
from the user agent or the browser.

28
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.020
Those styles that come with
your browser are applied first,

29
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.562
the user may override those
styles with their own stylesheet.

30
00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:05.962
And you as the author or the developer
will override the user styles.

31
00:02:05.962 --> 00:02:08.251
That sounds a little bit odd.

32
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:09.860
But wait until we get to the end.

33
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.430
So we as the author will override
anything that the user wants.

34
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.813
The next thing that happens are,
animations in CSS,

35
00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:20.681
that have @key frame associated with them.

36
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:23.006
So this is the true kinds of animation,

37
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.040
not transitions which
are analyzed differently.

38
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.655
Why would we be putting
our animations here?

39
00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:30.582
Is a great question.

40
00:02:30.582 --> 00:02:35.208
The reason why is, we don't want
the cascade specificity and so

41
00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:40.778
forth get in the way of an animation that
is executing as things are changing,

42
00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:43.282
and then animation is happening.

43
00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:47.897
We wanna be sure that, that animation
is gonna beat anything else that

44
00:02:47.897 --> 00:02:50.948
might be there in
the author stylesheet that,

45
00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:54.411
that encounters as it moves
through space and time.

46
00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.526
Then we have the Mirror Universe.

47
00:02:56.526 --> 00:03:01.457
Okay, so we have all of our
regular normal importance ones,

48
00:03:01.457 --> 00:03:04.950
the important ones go the opposite order.

49
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.213
So, the author styles even
though in normal importance,

50
00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:12.265
they are almost the most important ones.

51
00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:14.428
They are the least important ones.

52
00:03:14.428 --> 00:03:17.252
When we start putting
bang important on things.

53
00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:22.164
The user can override the author styles if
they start putting bang important on it.

54
00:03:22.164 --> 00:03:25.366
So when you take a look
at a user stylesheet for

55
00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:27.737
somebody who has visual issues.

56
00:03:27.737 --> 00:03:32.458
You will find that it is full of Bang
important, because they wanna override

57
00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:36.296
things that are coming from
the web developers stylesheets,

58
00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:39.415
even if they have been
important on them already.

59
00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:44.847
Notice that close to the bottom here,
the most important one is the user agent,

60
00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:47.780
the browser with an important style on it.

61
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.357
So if that browser stylesheet
has a bank important on it,

62
00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:54.573
you will find it next to
impossible to override it.

63
00:03:54.573 --> 00:03:58.756
The only thing that overrides all
of those are CSS transitions,

64
00:03:58.756 --> 00:04:03.559
you may be familiar with the CSS
transition property that does things like

65
00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.523
rotating things moves in space and
so forth.

66
00:04:06.523 --> 00:04:09.079
And those are the most important again for

67
00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.682
the same reason as the animations as
we move things through time and space,

68
00:04:13.682 --> 00:04:17.574
we wanna be sure that we don't
see weird artifacts happening.

69
00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:20.713
As the transition or
the animation is executed, and so

70
00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:24.001
that's why these get higher importance,
and cascade.

71
00:04:28.085 --> 00:04:32.193
Okay, so in summary then as you
look at that great big huge table,

72
00:04:32.193 --> 00:04:34.444
here's what you need to remember.

73
00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:40.246
The animations have more importance to
them than anything with a normal value,

74
00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:44.316
whether that's a user,
author, or user agent style,

75
00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:48.149
animations will beat
anything with normal values.

76
00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:51.752
Bang important beats the animations.

77
00:04:51.752 --> 00:04:55.967
And transitions beat bang important.

78
00:04:55.967 --> 00:05:00.067
That's kind of that summary in a nukshell,
if you can remember those things

79
00:05:00.067 --> 00:05:04.371
you'll probably remember most of the way
that, that cascade happens to work.
