00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.852
So one of the questions that people
had here in the room were the some of

2
00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:06.852
the terminology behind CSS.

3
00:00:06.852 --> 00:00:10.523
So I thought we'd just take
a look at a declaration here,

4
00:00:10.523 --> 00:00:15.660
actually technically a rule, and
we'd go through some of these definitions.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.350
So one of these things here
on the page just like this,

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.328
this is called the CSS rule.

7
00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:24.935
All of the bits and
parts together, that is a rule.

8
00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:26.814
A rule is broken into two parts.

9
00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:28.502
One part is the selector.

10
00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:33.832
In this case, it's everything you see
here in line 1, that's technically

11
00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:39.090
three different selectors, separated
by commas in this particular case.

12
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.994
You could have, of course,
several of those.

13
00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:46.070
They might be descendant selectors,
they might be group selectors like this.

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.290
There's all kinds of
different possibilities.

15
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.345
But anything outside of those curly
brackets, those are selectors.

16
00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:55.277
Then you have inside of that
between the curly brackets,

17
00:00:55.277 --> 00:00:57.305
this is called the declaration block.

18
00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:01.855
Each individual line is a declaration.

19
00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:04.440
So color red, that's a declaration.

20
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.190
Font family, Arial, Sans Serif,
that's a declaration.

21
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.622
And then the declarations
are broken into two parts.

22
00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:16.885
One part is a property,
that's the left side of the colon.

23
00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:20.958
The other part on the right side
of the colon is a value [LAUGH].

24
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:25.240
We talk about property value pairs,
they're everywhere.

25
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.610
So yes, those are properties and values.

26
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.820
So those are the words that
are normally talked about with CSS.

27
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.634
So we'll talk a lot about selectors,

28
00:01:34.634 --> 00:01:37.025
that's the stuff outside
of the curly brackets.

29
00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:40.147
Way less emphasis on what's inside
of the curly brackets today.

30
00:01:40.147 --> 00:01:42.980
We're gonna talk about properties and
values, lots and

31
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.580
lots of properties and values.
