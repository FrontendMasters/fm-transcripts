00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.719
Let's take a look at a demo
of how specificity can work.

2
00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.535
And to make this demo work
really particularly well,

3
00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:09.798
we're gonna work from the bottom
of the stylesheet going up.

4
00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:14.527
To show you that this is not a matter of
what comes later in the stylesheet is what

5
00:00:14.527 --> 00:00:15.324
is applied.

6
00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.524
I'm actually gonna start at the bottom
of the stylesheet and go backwards.

7
00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:22.895
So that you can see that the cascade
isn't in effect at all in these

8
00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:25.960
particular demo that I'm showing you.

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.151
This demo comes from Manuel MatuzoviÄ‡,
who is from HTMLHell,

10
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.330
a great website, I totally recommend it.

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.006
He wrote this demo originally
with just a colored square,

12
00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:41.958
I've rewritten it with colors and fonts so
that you can see the big differences

13
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.110
between what happens as
we change selectors.

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.279
So we start here with
the words Frontend Masters,

15
00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:53.460
they are taking on the style from
the browser style sheet, so it's black.

16
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.796
It is Times New Roman, and you'll see
here, I've added a font size of 3rem,

17
00:00:57.796 --> 00:01:02.480
just to make it bigger on the screen so
you can see what's going on.

18
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.059
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
uncommon these styles one at a time and

19
00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:13.225
show you how they take
effect here on the screen.

20
00:01:14.295 --> 00:01:21.085
So the first style that I have here, which
is almost the last one in the style sheet,

21
00:01:21.085 --> 00:01:25.165
the last one being the font size,
is where(p).

22
00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:28.520
What is the specificity of that?

23
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.041
Remember where has no specificity
at all including what's inside of

24
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:33.420
the parentheses.

25
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.086
And so I have made it the color of
blue and the font family of Barrio,

26
00:01:37.086 --> 00:01:40.180
you can see that it's changed
kind of radically there.

27
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.135
We can override that simply
by using our paragraph.

28
00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:52.854
And so now I'm changing this to red, and a
font family called covered By Your Grace.

29
00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:56.310
So that has a specificity of 001.

30
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.000
It is just a type selector, it's going to
take priority over where(p) even though

31
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.458
where(p) comes later in the style sheet.

32
00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.266
Now, we can take advantage of classes,

33
00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:12.541
you'll notice here in our
HTML we do have a class.

34
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.832
So I've used that here, I've changed
the color to medium orchid, and

35
00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:18.699
the font family of Faster One.

36
00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.814
And you can see that the class
is beating the paragraph,

37
00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:24.790
probably something you
would expect to happen.

38
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.858
We're changing that again, but
adding paragraph dot, the class name

39
00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:35.900
that indicates a paragraph with the class
of in this case femClass together.

40
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.482
And we are using the color green and
the font family of Joan.

41
00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:48.093
Now, one of the tricks that you can do if
you need to increase your specificity but

42
00:02:48.093 --> 00:02:52.237
you don't have access to the HTML,
is you can double up on classes.

43
00:02:52.237 --> 00:02:56.467
So here we've put in femClass,
femClass, dot, dot,

44
00:02:56.467 --> 00:03:00.337
next to each other to
indicate that we've declared

45
00:03:00.337 --> 00:03:05.029
that class twice even though it
only appears once in the HTML.

46
00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.733
By putting it in twice,
we have bumped up our specificity, so

47
00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:10.600
the specificity here is what?

48
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.421
0-2-0 as opposed to earlier here on

49
00:03:15.421 --> 00:03:20.098
the page where we had it as 0-1-1 or

50
00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:24.820
even earlier where we had 0-1-0.

51
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.593
So by doubling up on those class names,

52
00:03:27.593 --> 00:03:31.972
you can raise the specificity and
that is sometimes helpful.

53
00:03:34.554 --> 00:03:37.268
We'll make it even stronger for

54
00:03:37.268 --> 00:03:42.202
the specificity here is styling via ID,
so this is femID.

55
00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:47.779
We've made the color brown, and we've made
the font family now Major Mono Display.

56
00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:52.072
So of course,
the specificity there is 1,0,0.

57
00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:56.218
Raise this specificity again
by putting a p in front of it.

58
00:03:56.218 --> 00:04:01.341
p with the ID means that
the specificity is 1,0,1.

59
00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:05.543
And now,
we have a different color and font.

60
00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.051
We can also of course,
combine our ID and our class.

61
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:15.848
Now, our specificity's up to 1,1,0,
so we have our class and

62
00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:18.556
ID together to change the font again.

63
00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:26.444
We can double up on our ID to
raise our specificity to 2,0,0 and

64
00:04:26.444 --> 00:04:29.175
change the font another time.

65
00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:41.847
And here we are using is, so
in this particular selector,

66
00:04:41.847 --> 00:04:46.208
we're saying the ID, femID,
is either the femID or

67
00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:51.584
it's invalid, invalid, so
basically, we're doing a test.

68
00:04:51.584 --> 00:04:54.829
So if the element with an ID of femID,

69
00:04:54.829 --> 00:04:59.857
happens to also have an ID of femID,
little redundant but

70
00:04:59.857 --> 00:05:05.010
it works, or something invalid,
then style it this way.

71
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.169
So the first item is true, the second
item is not, is applies in this case.

72
00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:12.523
What is the specificity?

73
00:05:12.523 --> 00:05:17.885
We would count the most specific selector
here inside of is, which would be invalid

74
00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:23.266
invalid, so that counts for two, plus
the one outside of it so this is 3,0,0.

75
00:05:23.266 --> 00:05:26.200
Now, comes the one that sort
of blows people's minds.

76
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.893
I'm back to a specificity
of just the p again, okay?

77
00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:35.510
But I am changing the color
of the font via animation.

78
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.214
This is a little preview for what we're
gonna look at when we look at the cascade.

79
00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:43.006
Anything having to do with the animation
will actually take priority,

80
00:05:43.006 --> 00:05:46.450
even over the most specific
selectors that are out there.

81
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.524
And in this case,
as you can see it's not really moving,

82
00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:55.988
so the animation is pretty
quick at zero seconds.

83
00:05:55.988 --> 00:06:00.242
But it's enough to change the font
family here to a different color and

84
00:06:00.242 --> 00:06:01.549
to a different font.

85
00:06:01.549 --> 00:06:07.097
And then finally, just to show you
the impact of important on all of this,

86
00:06:07.097 --> 00:06:12.927
the most specific one of all is when we
start throwing in our bang importance.

87
00:06:12.927 --> 00:06:15.875
So here I've put a bang
important by the color,

88
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:19.708
a bang important by the font name,
and that will take priority

89
00:06:19.708 --> 00:06:23.777
over everything even though it
occurs earliest in the document.

90
00:06:23.777 --> 00:06:26.958
So these last two styles
that I've applied here,

91
00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:31.048
these last two rules for
the importance and with the animation,

92
00:06:31.048 --> 00:06:35.002
are actually the cascade taking
priority over specificity.

93
00:06:35.002 --> 00:06:37.765
It's sort of a sneak preview
as to what comes next.

94
00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:43.735
But prior to that, from our crazy is
selector and going further down the page,

95
00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:49.361
that is all specificity that's there
in action in this particular demo.

96
00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:53.144
&gt;&gt; There's been like thanks, great, wow,

97
00:06:53.144 --> 00:06:54.567
interesting-
&gt;&gt; Okay.

98
00:06:54.567 --> 00:06:57.129
&gt;&gt; Through the day so far.

99
00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:02.931
But as Sanjana, I don't know,
sorry if I butchered your name,

100
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:06.766
says beautiful demo by the way.

101
00:07:06.766 --> 00:07:14.294
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so all the thanks here to Manuel,
appreciate it.

102
00:07:14.294 --> 00:07:21.803
He does great work, his blog at HTMHell,
fantastic, encourage you to read it.

103
00:07:21.803 --> 00:07:24.588
&gt;&gt; What do you think about
the use of important?

104
00:07:24.588 --> 00:07:26.119
Do you think it's overused-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

105
00:07:26.119 --> 00:07:27.673
&gt;&gt; And should be avoided?

106
00:07:27.673 --> 00:07:32.639
&gt;&gt; Yes, we're gonna talk about that though
in a couple of little segments here.

107
00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.572
We will talk about important.

108
00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:37.420
&gt;&gt; And then they're asking
if you could share the demo?

109
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.280
&gt;&gt; Share the demo?

110
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.022
&gt;&gt; It's on the course.

111
00:07:41.022 --> 00:07:46.580
&gt;&gt; Yes, the course website if
you didn't join us yesterday,

112
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.483
this is semantics-selectors.css.education.

113
00:07:51.483 --> 00:07:54.342
I think Mark is gonna put
it in the chat for you.

114
00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:57.864
And we are currently on chapter five,
specificity,

115
00:07:57.864 --> 00:08:02.027
and we we're just looking at part one,
the specificity demo.

116
00:08:02.027 --> 00:08:05.651
And in my comments here,
I've referenced the original demo, and

117
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.253
then of course,
I made some adjustments to it.
