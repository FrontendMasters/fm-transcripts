00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.022
Now that we understand how inheritance
works, now that we understand

2
00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:08.674
how specificity work, let's put these
two together and see how they interact.

3
00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:14.812
So I am taking the look now at chapter
three inside of the course website and

4
00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:19.665
we are looking at specificity and
inheritance together.

5
00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:22.497
And I am looking at the code
pen that we have here.

6
00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.028
All right, so the first thing to do
anytime you start working in CSS is always

7
00:00:30.028 --> 00:00:34.074
to look at your HTML first and
understand what's going on with that.

8
00:00:34.074 --> 00:00:37.765
So we'll start with, we have an article.

9
00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:41.806
It has an id of coffee and
it has a class of Joe, followed by an h1,

10
00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:44.539
we have a paragraph with
a link inside of it.

11
00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:47.086
We have a paragraph with subscripts.

12
00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:50.744
This is the formula for caffeine.

13
00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:52.755
And in chemistry,
those would wind up being subscripts.

14
00:00:52.755 --> 00:00:57.896
So that's why we have all those
little sub tags that are in there.

15
00:00:57.896 --> 00:01:01.922
The next paragraph we have some
superscripts inside of it,

16
00:01:01.922 --> 00:01:04.671
those are footnotes and a 10th place.

17
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:08.732
So those typically go up a little bit,
so we are using superscript for

18
00:01:08.732 --> 00:01:11.051
that same thing in the next paragraph.

19
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:12.336
And then we have a footer.

20
00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.071
The footer contains some references.

21
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:18.033
We have an h2 for our references,
we have an unordered list, and

22
00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:20.274
there's some links inside of that.

23
00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:24.099
So that is what's going on here.

24
00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:28.850
Now let's just say that I want to
style some of these superscripts.

25
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.976
Those are the ones that go up.

26
00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:33.813
There's a number of them that
are inside of the second paragraph, and

27
00:01:33.813 --> 00:01:36.554
I guess we have one inside
of the third paragraph.

28
00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:41.228
There's a few different ways that I could
wind up writing selectors for this.

29
00:01:41.228 --> 00:01:43.650
So let's write some of these.

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.895
I could say article has the color red.

31
00:01:48.895 --> 00:01:54.087
So that is going to turn almost
everything here on this page red.

32
00:01:54.087 --> 00:01:56.967
Why are the links not red?

33
00:01:56.967 --> 00:02:00.964
If the links are not red because they have
a more specific selector that's coming

34
00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:02.687
from the browser's style sheet.

35
00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:04.552
They are targeted towards those links.

36
00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:08.672
They wind up being blue and
underlined when they are not visited.

37
00:02:08.672 --> 00:02:11.779
So that is why that looks the way it does.

38
00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:17.699
After this, we can add to this the p,
with a color blue.

39
00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.835
Now, the way we have this right now, the
paragraph comes later, you may be thinking

40
00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:25.171
to yourself, okay, it's later in
the style sheet, so that wins.

41
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:30.031
But even if I was to take this paragraph,
with the color of blue, and

42
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:36.003
put it before the article, you would find
out that we still have blue paragraphs and

43
00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.507
that is inheritance at work here.

44
00:02:38.507 --> 00:02:43.445
Inheritance is saying that we are closer
to some element that we might be

45
00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:44.362
targeting.

46
00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:49.855
In this case we're going towards the sub,
the superscripts.

47
00:02:49.855 --> 00:02:54.203
And the paragraphs are a little closer
now everything is is blue here.

48
00:02:54.203 --> 00:02:59.313
And then the last one we can add then,
of course is to target sub itself.

49
00:02:59.313 --> 00:03:03.550
And we'll say something
like color brown or

50
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.139
possibly even let's just
make it black again.

51
00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.136
We make them black.

52
00:03:10.136 --> 00:03:13.672
No that didn't really work,
let's do brown.

53
00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:16.571
They'll be a little bit.

54
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.794
Stand out a little bit and
we'll add to that a font

55
00:03:20.794 --> 00:03:25.738
weight of bold to try to get
them to stand out a little bit.

56
00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:29.774
So as we get close and
closer to the targeted elements,

57
00:03:29.774 --> 00:03:34.602
we have now three styles that
would all impact our superscripts,

58
00:03:34.602 --> 00:03:37.961
they all have exactly
the same specificity.

59
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:39.524
So supstyle come last.

60
00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:44.526
We could put it earlier in the cascade
here, earlier on the page.

61
00:03:44.526 --> 00:03:45.950
It still takes effect.

62
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.357
This is because of inheritance and

63
00:03:48.357 --> 00:03:53.589
we are trying to target those superscripts
and this is the closest to that.

64
00:03:56.344 --> 00:03:58.424
Now, we could, of course,

65
00:03:58.424 --> 00:04:03.466
make our article a little bit more
effective on those superscripts.

66
00:04:03.466 --> 00:04:04.997
You might be thinking about this.

67
00:04:04.997 --> 00:04:07.387
We might just wanna add a class to it.

68
00:04:07.387 --> 00:04:11.361
We do have that class
here inside of our HTML.

69
00:04:11.361 --> 00:04:13.776
We have an ID of coffee and
a class of Joe.

70
00:04:13.776 --> 00:04:15.271
Let's add all of those.

71
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:20.367
So if I said article of coffee.joe.

72
00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:27.892
So now I've got the ID and the class and
the type selector all together there.

73
00:04:27.892 --> 00:04:31.852
The text hasn't changed,
it is still just red.

74
00:04:31.852 --> 00:04:36.990
The little lowly paragraph that comes
later with way lower specificity

75
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.311
that first one there article coffee
Joe that has a specificity of 111.

76
00:04:42.311 --> 00:04:45.218
The paragraph that comes later and 001.

77
00:04:45.218 --> 00:04:48.954
Why is that one winning,
that is Inheritance.

78
00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:53.687
Inheritance is saying that the color
blue is an inherited color it's

79
00:04:53.687 --> 00:04:57.043
close to the paragraph we
wind up with blue text.

80
00:04:57.043 --> 00:05:02.602
So how could we make In this article
style actually apply to the superscript.

81
00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:07.185
The way we'd have to do that is
add an sup, it's up on the end.

82
00:05:07.185 --> 00:05:09.030
Once we've done that,

83
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.199
then we are in fact targeting our
superscripts which are now red and

84
00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:20.123
maybe we can set a background color of
black to make them stand out even more.

85
00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:22.250
There they are, on the page.

86
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.967
And that wins over the brown that we
had previously because now this is

87
00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:34.291
got a very specific selector that is
in fact targeting those superscripts.

88
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:39.934
So now the specificity is winning out
over just the straight inheritance.

89
00:05:39.934 --> 00:05:44.212
So the next time you are puzzled
as to why some type of elements,

90
00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:48.331
just plain old element,
a type selector is winning over your

91
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:53.117
super specific bang important type
of style, this is the reason why.

92
00:05:53.117 --> 00:05:57.607
Inheritance is going to take priority
in some situations over specificity.
