00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.250
Now it's time for you to do your own
work with specificity and inheritance.

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.185
And, I have an exercise here for

3
00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:10.870
you you're actually not going
to write any code at all.

4
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.123
What I would like for

5
00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:16.640
you to do this is the same HTML that
we just worked with previously.

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.850
What I'd like for you to do is to
look at the CSS and do the following.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.737
First of all I'd like you to calculate
the specificity of each of the selectors

8
00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:28.120
that you see here in the list.

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.992
And then the second thing I'd like for
you to do,

10
00:00:30.992 --> 00:00:33.940
is to explain why the page
looks the way it does.

11
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.285
So for example if we start with a footer,
I would say that the specificity is 001,

12
00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:44.027
and that the color is pink because if you
take a look at the footer down here at

13
00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:50.130
the bottom, you'll see that references,
the bullets, and the numbers are all pink.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.331
From that style, but the links are still
taking on the styling that comes from

15
00:00:55.331 --> 00:01:01.110
the default browser stylesheet that colors
unvisited links in blue and underlined.

16
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.640
And of course the font is
coming from the body element.

17
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.943
So, that is what I would like for
you to do now, and

18
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:12.433
when you come back I will
explain all of these to you.
