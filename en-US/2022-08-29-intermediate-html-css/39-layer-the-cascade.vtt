00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.281
So last thing that I'd like to talk
about are this new structure in CSS that

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:06.619
are called layers.

3
00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:12.694
And it's another @rule like @media or
@supports this one is @layer.

4
00:00:12.694 --> 00:00:17.428
And the, @layer CSS rule is used
to declare a cascade layer and

5
00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:22.517
can also be used to define the order
of precedence in case of multiple

6
00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:27.240
cascade layers, which is really,
really complicated.

7
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.180
But let's try to interpret.

8
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.675
I think a lot of people are thinking about
this as a way of bundling their styles for

9
00:00:33.675 --> 00:00:35.200
distribution purposes.

10
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.414
So in other words, I can bundle
my JavaScript into a component.

11
00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:43.312
I'm gonna bundle my CSS into a layer and
then when you incorporate this into

12
00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:46.655
your own document that
somehow magically whatever

13
00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:51.490
is in that layer will be associated
with that particular JavaScript.

14
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.729
And I'm afraid to tell you that
that isn't necessarily true, but

15
00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.880
a layer may help you depending on how
you configure the rest of your CSS.

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.830
So let's dig into this
a little bit further.

17
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.080
This is now the chart for how author style
sheets are going to work with layers.

18
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.478
So this is a blow up of
all of the other cascades.

19
00:01:17.478 --> 00:01:22.288
So everything that has to do with user
agent, style sheets, user style sheets,

20
00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:25.116
all of that is all still
part of our cascade, but

21
00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:29.410
now let's just focus on what goes
on in the author stylesheet.

22
00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.073
So, what is gonna happen is
that are layered styles, so

23
00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:39.430
you can just think of this as
a grouping of styles that is a layer,

24
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.420
they are going to be
the least specific styles.

25
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.676
And you can indicate exactly what order
you want your layers to appear even if

26
00:01:47.676 --> 00:01:51.068
they are not appearing in that
order within the style sheet,

27
00:01:51.068 --> 00:01:56.090
you can spell out exactly, I want this
layer first, I want this next one second.

28
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.975
Even though there may be distributed all
over your style sheet all over several

29
00:02:00.975 --> 00:02:03.429
style sheets, you can indicate that.

30
00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.231
Whatever order you have, the very first
layer is the least specific the last

31
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:10.857
layer is the most specific but note that,

32
00:02:10.857 --> 00:02:17.050
unlayered styles are gonna take precedence
over anything that are inside of layer.

33
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.562
So if you're not using layers
in your CSS right now, and

34
00:02:20.562 --> 00:02:23.255
you import somebody else's layered CSS,

35
00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:28.070
their styles will not take priority
over yours given the same specificity.

36
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.658
So after that comes our inline styles,
so all of the unlayered styles,

37
00:02:35.658 --> 00:02:40.333
or inline styles, or
animations are still the highest priority,

38
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.020
then we go to the mirror universe.

39
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.137
So we start adding on being important,

40
00:02:45.137 --> 00:02:49.840
the unlayered styles are the least
specific where they're being important.

41
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.477
The layered styles with being important
wind up being more specific, and

42
00:02:54.477 --> 00:02:59.339
the unlayered styles with the being
important wide up being the most specific

43
00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.210
until we get to transitions.

44
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.630
So, I am afraid that we
might wind up seeing for

45
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.060
people who think that layers are gonna
to be this useful thing for exporting.

46
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.734
Their styles that are bundled with their
JavaScript are gonna wind up littering

47
00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:21.338
them with bang importance, because then
their styles will take priority over

48
00:03:21.338 --> 00:03:25.120
anything that comes from
your particular environment.

49
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.822
Bear in mind that the goal is, I wanna
import somebody's JavaScript widget

50
00:03:29.822 --> 00:03:35.290
into my document, and I want it to look
like it belongs in the page that I'm on.

51
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.353
So if you litter up your layer with all
the bang important styles, that is not

52
00:03:39.353 --> 00:03:43.291
gonna happen, it'll take on your
styling for your JavaScript widget but

53
00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:46.700
it may not match the branding for
the rest of the webpage.

54
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.823
So, try to avoid the urge of putting
bang importance all over your layers.

55
00:03:51.823 --> 00:03:54.495
The layer syntax,
we could talk about that.

56
00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:57.751
There's a lot of different ways
to call layers in the document,

57
00:03:57.751 --> 00:04:01.625
they are called named layers,
nested layers and anonymous layers.

58
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:08.118
And so let's just take a quick
peek at the Mozilla web page here,

59
00:04:08.118 --> 00:04:15.831
MDN, and this is gonna show you a bunch
of different ways to include layers.

60
00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:24.433
So here inside of the syntax box, let's
just talk through all of these very very

61
00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:28.500
quickly, the first line there in
that syntax box shows you @layer.

62
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.720
So it tells you we're
gonna talk about a layer.

63
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.190
Then we have a name for that layer.

64
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.910
So you can assign it
whatever name you want.

65
00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.240
Obviously, you should make it relatable
to whatever's inside of the layer.

66
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.700
And then you put in your rules.

67
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.050
You can just lift them right after that.

68
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.580
You can also declare
a layer with just a name.

69
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.240
You don't have to put any
styles inside of that layer.

70
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.980
You can simply say that it exists.

71
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.776
The third example is something that you
might put at the top of your CSS style

72
00:04:56.776 --> 00:04:57.790
sheet.

73
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.215
This is going to indicate all of the
layers that you're going to include inside

74
00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:07.210
of this particular style sheet and the
order in which they should be considered.

75
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.063
So if I had layers here let's say that
their names were a, b and c, but yet

76
00:05:12.063 --> 00:05:15.883
in my overall style sheet they
appeared in the order of c,

77
00:05:15.883 --> 00:05:20.578
a, b, they would still be considered
by the cascade in the order that I

78
00:05:20.578 --> 00:05:25.470
list them here in this first line
of code I would say @layer abc.

79
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.160
So abc would be the order in
which they were considered.

80
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.730
And then finally,
you can have an anonymous layer.

81
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:36.088
As with all things anonymous in
programming that indicates that there is

82
00:05:36.088 --> 00:05:38.150
no name associated with the layer.

83
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.320
So you could just declare an @layer and
put rules inside of it.

84
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.950
But bear in mind that when there's
no name, it can also be manipulated.

85
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.833
So, with a named layer, you can add
rules to it later by calling out

86
00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:54.640
that name layer and
adding on more styles to it.

87
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.740
When you work with an anonymous layer,
you wouldn't be able to do that.

88
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.533
So all of the usual caveats that
are associated with anonymous

89
00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:05.000
apply here to CSS as well.

90
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.120
So I would recommend that
you name your layers.

91
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.624
Now that you have a sense of what
layers are, how the syntax works,

92
00:06:11.624 --> 00:06:14.930
let's dig into this inside
of our GitHub files.

93
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.918
We'll be working in VS Code, and

94
00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:20.683
we're gonna work with somebody
has distributed a component,

95
00:06:20.683 --> 00:06:26.025
it's called add me, and we're going to try
incorporating that into our main document.
