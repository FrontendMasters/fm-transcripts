1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.274
What I'd like to do next is, we're
continuing work in the same index.html and

2
00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:08.992
style.css that we have been
working with here in VS code.

3
00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:12.891
We've now been given a separate HTML and

4
00:00:12.891 --> 00:00:17.140
CSS file from our other developer friends.

5
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.717
Maybe this was something we
downloaded from online or

6
00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:23.410
maybe it is something that somebody
else on the team was working on.

7
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:29.380
And we've been asked to integrate this
HTML and CSS into our document here.

8
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.134
So if you take a look at your file
structure here inside of your folders,

9
00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:38.050
you will find that there is
a file called addme.html.

10
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.350
We're going to be working with that.

11
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.507
And we have a CSS file that's
called addme.css and so

12
00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:54.082
that is the HTML and CSS that we're gonna
be working with here in this example.

13
00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:00.934
And I always put on the word wrap.

14
00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:09.744
The first thing that you probably wanna do
is, see what these people have given you.

15
00:01:09.744 --> 00:01:14.330
So let's just take a quick peek at
what's going on, if we just open up

16
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.249
addme.html in a browser, you'll see
here that it's basically a card.

17
00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:23.792
So we've been given a painting,
it has some additional information

18
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:27.239
underneath of it about that
particular painting and

19
00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.940
it has a button that is going
to take you somewhere else.

20
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.378
This is not an HTML button, this is a link
that has been styled as a button because

21
00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:39.502
when you click this you're gonna
visit the two inch brush.com website.

22
00:01:39.502 --> 00:01:41.608
So that's what we have here and

23
00:01:41.608 --> 00:01:46.874
we're being asked to incorporate it
into the index.html page that we have.

24
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.720
So how would we go about doing this?

25
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.224
Well, first of all,

26
00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:57.832
we're going to start by grabbing
the HTML that is relevant to us.

27
00:01:57.832 --> 00:02:01.051
And if you just take a quick
look at what is here,

28
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.120
you'll see that there's nothing special.

29
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.400
It just has a stylesheet
associated with it.

30
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.710
And the content is simply
a figure in HTML figure element.

31
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.825
So let us grab that HTML figure element,
I'm going to simply copy it.

32
00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:23.623
And then you can close addme.html,
we won't need it anymore.

33
00:02:23.623 --> 00:02:28.861
Here inside of my document,
I need to place this somewhere, let's say,

34
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.772
we're gonna place it inside of
the article right here after the h1.

35
00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:38.898
So I'm just gonna copy and
paste, so there it is, great,

36
00:02:38.898 --> 00:02:45.610
let's Save it and let's look at
index.html inside of our browser window.

37
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.039
We look at that,

38
00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:52.976
you'll see that we have our webpage
that we've been working with all along.

39
00:02:52.976 --> 00:02:56.175
You'll see that we have a card here,
but of course,

40
00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.960
it's lost some of its
styling along the way.

41
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.722
We had an inline style for
the figure element.

42
00:03:01.722 --> 00:03:04.220
It said that the max width was 450 pixels,

43
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.665
happens to match the width
of that picture.

44
00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:11.219
Which is why it is this narrower width
if we didn't have that there then

45
00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:13.379
we would copy and paste this in and

46
00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.024
it would stretch all the way
across our browser window.

47
00:03:17.024 --> 00:03:22.727
So that's cool, but of course,
didn't bring in any of the styling.

48
00:03:22.727 --> 00:03:27.147
And since we haven't integrated the style
sheet, none of that is a surprise.

49
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.676
When integrating my addme.css file
into my main style sheet style.css,

50
00:03:33.676 --> 00:03:38.920
there's a bunch of different ways
we could go about doing this.

51
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.504
Clearly, we could copy and paste
the styles from one end to the other and

52
00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:46.534
try to integrate them manually or we
could keep these as separate stylesheets.

53
00:03:46.534 --> 00:03:48.411
I'm gonna walk you through this,

54
00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:52.552
keeping this as separate style sheets
because I suspect that many of you will

55
00:03:52.552 --> 00:03:56.840
probably do something similar when
working in your own environments.

56
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.148
And to do that, then I'm gonna
switch over to style.css, and

57
00:04:03.148 --> 00:04:10.064
at the very top of style.css even
before the root declaration here.

58
00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:16.949
What we're gonna do is,
we are going to add the following code.

59
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.799
We're going to add
an add import statement,

60
00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.080
we're gonna import from our own file and
we're gonna import what?

61
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.028
We're gonna import addme.css.

62
00:04:30.028 --> 00:04:34.912
So that of course is going to import
the style sheet that's right there in our

63
00:04:34.912 --> 00:04:36.985
file structure, addme.css.

64
00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:41.871
And we are going to declare it as
a layer with the name of addme because

65
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:46.040
I'm super creative that way and
reuse all my names.

66
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.000
So we've now created a layer called
add me inside of this style sheet.

67
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.589
And it will include this
styles basically the styles

68
00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:59.620
from the addme.css inside of it.

69
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.001
Now as of this recording,

70
00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:08.340
I am working with the most recent
version of VS code for Mac.

71
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.210
However, you'll see that
VS code is very upset with

72
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.080
me it does not like the code
that I have just written.

73
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.893
And that is because, VS code has
not been programmed to know about

74
00:05:19.893 --> 00:05:24.543
the layer specification yet or
the code that I have put in here.

75
00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:29.414
It does in fact work but it'll look
like I have written bad code and so

76
00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:34.798
you'll just have to ignore that error,
hopefully in a month or a few months

77
00:05:34.798 --> 00:05:39.960
when VS code pushes out another update
that will no longer be an issue.

78
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.816
It is good code, but
it is cutting edge CSS, and so

79
00:05:42.816 --> 00:05:44.795
that is what we see here right now.

80
00:05:48.387 --> 00:05:51.800
Okay, so let's save that.

81
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.839
And let's take a look at how
our webpage is progressing

82
00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:01.287
I open up my HTML in
my default browser and

83
00:06:01.287 --> 00:06:06.770
now what I have going on is,
it looks a little bit maybe.

84
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.611
Better be button style is in fact present,
but

85
00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:14.723
the text is pink, not white.

86
00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:18.583
No, I didn't write a button to look
that way, that looks awful, but

87
00:06:18.583 --> 00:06:21.460
it was originally a purple
button with white text.

88
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.829
And you'll see here, the hover state works
but the text inside of it is hot pink.

89
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.423
And now I have an interesting button
looking thing down here at the bottom,

90
00:06:32.423 --> 00:06:34.130
in the footer.

91
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:38.516
So there are styles here as well that
are causing this link to be formatted like

92
00:06:38.516 --> 00:06:40.290
a gigantic button.

93
00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.740
So now we have to figure out
what is going on with this.

94
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.430
Also that is of course not
the purple that I started with.

95
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.109
So what is happening?

96
00:06:53.764 --> 00:07:00.210
If we take a look at our CSS,
I'm in my main stylesheet style.css here.

97
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:03.710
We have declared purple
to be medium slate blue.

98
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.711
That is our purple here and in my CSS
that I got distributed, I now have

99
00:07:09.711 --> 00:07:16.520
a purple that has a variable here that
has a different shade of purple in it.

100
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.621
So these kinds of conflicts certainly
arise if you have good developers

101
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:26.903
who do better with prefacing these
with some kind of prefix or something.

102
00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:29.686
Then maybe you won't run into
these kinds of conflicts, but so

103
00:07:29.686 --> 00:07:32.140
somehow we're gonna have
to fix this problem.

104
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.180
The simplest thing to do here most
likely is just to rename this variable.

105
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.070
Let's call it DK purple.

106
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.570
So I've changed the name
of my variable here.

107
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.266
Now I need to make sure that I've changed
the instances of it here inside of this

108
00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:46.280
stylesheet.

109
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:49.600
So let us find where
that purple is called.

110
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.693
It's called here on the link, we need to
change the name from purple to DK purple.

111
00:07:56.685 --> 00:08:01.075
Okay, so if I save that now and
I go back to my,

112
00:08:03.985 --> 00:08:09.480
Web browser here and I refresh,
now I am using that dark purple

113
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:14.930
that I originally had inside
of my add this style sheet.

114
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:18.420
And so that little problem is resolved.

115
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:20.241
So that was straightforward enough to do.

116
00:08:23.377 --> 00:08:27.479
The text color though
comes from style.css, so

117
00:08:27.479 --> 00:08:31.090
let's take a look at that really quickly.

118
00:08:34.154 --> 00:08:39.332
So here inside of style.css,
you'll see that we have a, any link

119
00:08:39.332 --> 00:08:44.983
is set to have this hot pink color that
you see and use for all of the links.

120
00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:48.859
And since this style is not
inside of a layer itself and

121
00:08:48.859 --> 00:08:50.841
since it is more specific,

122
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:56.119
it is overwriting the white color that
I have here inside of these links.

123
00:08:56.119 --> 00:09:00.033
So that is something that
we're going to wanna fix.

124
00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:04.760
The other thing that we have
going on is that in our webpage,

125
00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:13.505
You will see that in the card
we have aerial as our font and

126
00:09:13.505 --> 00:09:16.320
outside of the card we have trebuchet.

127
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.958
So how are we going to
resolve that as well?

128
00:09:20.085 --> 00:09:25.284
Okay, So

129
00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:30.080
way that we can go about fixing this then,
are probably as follows.

130
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.898
Part of the reason that I put in a font
in here is to remind you that when you're

131
00:09:33.898 --> 00:09:38.016
distributing your code and you call out
things like fonts and colors and so forth,

132
00:09:38.016 --> 00:09:40.880
they might not match
somebody else's branding.

133
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.600
So these are things that you
might want to get rid of.

134
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.650
If we got rid of our root with
the variable of font here and

135
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:53.594
in our stylesheet,
maybe we have that same font here or

136
00:09:53.594 --> 00:09:57.474
maybe it will just call
from our body here.

137
00:09:57.474 --> 00:10:01.002
We can just use inheritance
to inherit that font here.

138
00:10:01.002 --> 00:10:04.749
If that's the case we're
gonna go with inheritance,

139
00:10:04.749 --> 00:10:09.889
then we should remove that call to that
font here which is here on line 11.

140
00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:13.878
We can just get rid of that, save that.

141
00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:20.902
And refresh and
now we're back to the correct fonts, but

142
00:10:20.902 --> 00:10:24.243
the problem with this white
text is gonna remain.

143
00:10:24.243 --> 00:10:28.888
So here in addme.css,
we could make this more specific.

144
00:10:28.888 --> 00:10:32.903
We could add a colon any link,
any hyphen link.

145
00:10:32.903 --> 00:10:35.044
That could definitely be a thing.

146
00:10:35.044 --> 00:10:39.677
We could certainly make it
more specific by adding

147
00:10:39.677 --> 00:10:43.539
additional selectors here to the style,

148
00:10:43.539 --> 00:10:48.640
like putting figure in front of it,
figure.

149
00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.049
And that might help some.

150
00:10:56.966 --> 00:10:59.560
For some things, but
it's not gonna help for all of them.

151
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:03.019
So fortunately,
by adding that figure in front of it,

152
00:11:03.019 --> 00:11:06.550
we managed to turn off the styling for
the footer.

153
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:11.325
We made it more specific to orient to the
links that are inside of the figure, but

154
00:11:11.325 --> 00:11:13.270
the figure color is still pink.

155
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.193
And that is because remember that our
layered styles are not gonna take

156
00:11:18.193 --> 00:11:23.460
priority over the unlearned styles and
that's what we have going on here.

157
00:11:23.460 --> 00:11:28.842
We have an unlearned style that is hot
pink, but our layered style is white.

158
00:11:28.842 --> 00:11:31.853
So this is just not a problem
that we're gonna be able to

159
00:11:31.853 --> 00:11:34.935
resolve using the little
tweaks that I've used so far.
