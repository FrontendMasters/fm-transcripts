00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.602
Hopefully you did really
well with that exercise and

2
00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:04.233
you don't have many questions.

3
00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:09.646
But if you do I'm gonna explain all of
these selectors to you now at this point.

4
00:00:09.646 --> 00:00:12.492
So just previously in the example
to show you how to do the exercise.

5
00:00:12.492 --> 00:00:17.280
And just explain the footer to you, so
I'm gonna start here with article-joe.

6
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.811
And the specificity for this one is 0-1-1,
we have one class, the class of joe.

7
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:27.800
We have one element, that's the article,
and the text will be brown.

8
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.351
Notice here on the page that,
the article is for the most part brown,

9
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:36.209
although you'll see here that
we have some blue going on.

10
00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:40.206
Kind of weird, maybe not sure
where that is coming from yet, but

11
00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:41.610
not from this style.

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.306
Probably there's some inheritance
that comes in later on, or

13
00:00:45.306 --> 00:00:48.943
perhaps a more specific selector
depending on what happens.

14
00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:52.771
The next one is p::first-of-type + p,

15
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:57.017
so we have to figure out
where this is happening.

16
00:00:57.017 --> 00:01:04.726
If we look at our HTML, notice that
the first child of this article is an h1.

17
00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:09.956
So paragraph as a first child,
would not be effective

18
00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:15.199
as a selector here,
we have to use first-of-type.

19
00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:21.810
So the first-of-type is this item
here this paragraph by Erica Lee.

20
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.380
So the paragraph that is the adjacent
sibling in other words the next

21
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.842
sibling right next to this one,
is here on line 6.

22
00:01:29.842 --> 00:01:31.780
So this line that starts Coffee,

23
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.999
this is the one that will be
affected by that particular style.

24
00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:40.904
And that is the text-transform: uppercase,
and

25
00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:44.790
as you can see here that whole
paragraph is indeed in uppercase.

26
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.104
The other paragraphs are not
affected because they are not

27
00:01:48.104 --> 00:01:52.306
an immediate adjacent sibling to that
first paragraph there on the page.

28
00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:57.578
Notice that our specificity is
set to 0-1-2, that is because

29
00:01:57.578 --> 00:02:03.523
first-of-type is a pseudo-class, and
our two Ps those count as types.

30
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:08.196
So we have 0-1-2 no IDs,
the next one is p:nth-of-type subscripts.

31
00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:12.572
And so we have to first determine
which is nth-of-type number (2).

32
00:02:12.572 --> 00:02:18.336
That is the paragraph that is all in
uppercase, that's our second paragraph.

33
00:02:18.336 --> 00:02:22.224
We're looking at the subscripts, right
here next to that chemical formula for

34
00:02:22.224 --> 00:02:22.812
caffeine.

35
00:02:22.812 --> 00:02:26.800
There should be some subscripts
they're not currently there.

36
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.220
We are using visibility: hidden to hide
those subscripts I have no idea why.

37
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.378
A chemist would not be pleased with me,
but that is,

38
00:02:36.378 --> 00:02:40.842
where that style is applying,
and why it is applying here.

39
00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:45.488
Notice that the selectors,
specificity is 0-1-2,

40
00:02:45.488 --> 00:02:50.713
nth-of-type is a pseudo-class,
sub and p are HTML elements.

41
00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:55.629
The next one is p::first-line so
first-line, is a pseudo element,

42
00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:00.153
p is also a type so
together it's 0-0-2 for our specificity.

43
00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:04.786
This is affecting the first
line of every paragraph, and

44
00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:09.333
notice that the byline here by Erika Lee,
is also blue.

45
00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.012
It may be a very short line,

46
00:03:11.012 --> 00:03:15.030
it may be the only line in the paragraph
it is still the first line.

47
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.792
And so therefore it is blue in addition
to the first line of all of these other

48
00:03:19.792 --> 00:03:20.706
paragraphs.

49
00:03:20.706 --> 00:03:23.398
And notice that,
first line is really adaptable so

50
00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:26.101
even as you change your screen size,
CSS keeps up.

51
00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:30.088
And however many or few words you have
on that line, they will remain blue.

52
00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:39.217
The next one is h1::after and h1::before,
after and before are also pseudo-elements.

53
00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:44.422
So the specificity of each of those
selectors is the same it's 0-0-2.

54
00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:48.862
We are gonna add some content,
in this case a coffee cup before and

55
00:03:48.862 --> 00:03:53.406
after I need coffee, and
that is what's going on here on the page.

56
00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:55.255
So, that is the way that one shakes out.
