00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.100
Okay, so let's go to our selector review.

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.730
So this is part one here.

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.584
We're going to,
I'm gonna open the ending code pen,

4
00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:09.517
you all open the beginning code pen.

5
00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:11.710
At the moment, they're the same and

6
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.624
because I'm gonna code
this live here in class.

7
00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:22.166
All right, so the reason we've got
this here as a giant unordered list

8
00:00:22.166 --> 00:00:26.700
which is a total mess because we
are going to go through a whole bunch of

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.415
kinds of selectors, lists are a great
way to start introducing those.

10
00:00:31.415 --> 00:00:32.671
So just as always,

11
00:00:32.671 --> 00:00:36.910
a quick peek at the HTML before
we start working with selectors.

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.530
You have to know the patterns in
your HTML before you write your CSS

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.975
selectors based on those
patterns in your HTML.

14
00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:50.145
So take a look at that there,
we have h1 at the top of the page.

15
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.736
We have a link.

16
00:00:51.736 --> 00:00:53.147
It has a title in it.

17
00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:58.013
We have a couple of classes along the way,
not as many classes as you would think.

18
00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:01.078
And we have links that go off site,

19
00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:06.277
we have links that stay on the site,
we have links to PDFs.

20
00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:10.775
And we have ordered and
unordered lists nested here.

21
00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:14.927
So the HTML should be pretty familiar
to you at this point in time.

22
00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:19.918
But the CSS, maybe not so much.

23
00:01:19.918 --> 00:01:23.570
All right, so
let's start by writing some styles then.

24
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.108
All right, at the very top of our
CSS here, we have a declaration.

25
00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:33.007
And you've probably seen this declaration
before, certainly, in my teaching, but

26
00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:36.715
maybe you've also seen this
declaration in other places in CSS.

27
00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:40.445
Does anybody here in the class
know what that means at the top,

28
00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:42.473
that crazy thing here at the top?

29
00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:44.783
Okay, no one in the class
knows what this means.

30
00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:47.650
All right, so star means what?

31
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.161
&gt;&gt; Select anything [INAUDIBLE].

32
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.912
&gt;&gt; Select everything in the universe,
right?

33
00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:56.116
What does star before mean, star after?

34
00:01:56.116 --> 00:02:00.540
&gt;&gt; The before or
after pseudo selectors on any element.

35
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.834
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're pseudo elements.

36
00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:05.994
We're gonna select the entire universe and
everything that comes before it and

37
00:02:05.994 --> 00:02:06.559
after it.

38
00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:07.865
[LAUGH] That's a lot.

39
00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:09.555
And we're going to apply what?

40
00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:13.130
We're going to apply this thing
called box styling border box.

41
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.230
So what is border box?

42
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.950
Okay, so the default is the content box.

43
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.091
The content box is when we start to do
math and we figure out how big things are.

44
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:24.580
We're going to add together
the width of our border,

45
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.195
we're gonna add together the width of
our padding, the width of our margin.

46
00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:35.031
And all of that together plus the content
winds up being the width of our box, okay?

47
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:38.651
When we say border box,
we're gonna lump a bunch of that together,

48
00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:42.478
we're gonna lump together the border and
the padding and the content.

49
00:02:42.478 --> 00:02:46.738
So if I said width is 500 pixels,
in a content box model,

50
00:02:46.738 --> 00:02:51.013
that would literally be just
the content is 500 pixels.

51
00:02:51.013 --> 00:02:55.157
We'd have to add to that the padding,
the border, and the margin.

52
00:02:55.157 --> 00:02:59.884
That is why when you say width of 500 and
then it still blows out your page and

53
00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:03.743
it's actually 600 pixels wide and
you're wondering why,

54
00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:06.385
that is where that comes from, all right.

55
00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:09.793
So border box says we're gonna lump
together the width of the border,

56
00:03:09.793 --> 00:03:11.366
the padding, and the content.

57
00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:15.832
So now when I say, 500 pixels,
even if my border is 2 pixels wide,

58
00:03:15.832 --> 00:03:21.209
even if my padding is 10 pixels wide,
all of that is included in the 500 pixels,

59
00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.905
and the content will scale accordingly.

60
00:03:23.905 --> 00:03:28.020
So we work with a constant 500 pixels,
make sense?

61
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.539
So the reason that I like to include this
here is because one of the things that

62
00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:39.593
I have told you a million times,
they're gonna put it on my gravestone.

63
00:03:39.593 --> 00:03:43.243
If you can't see it, you can't style it.

64
00:03:43.243 --> 00:03:47.245
So the biggest piece of advice,
if you take away nothing else today,

65
00:03:47.245 --> 00:03:50.777
put a border on it if you are trying
to debug something in CSS.

66
00:03:50.777 --> 00:03:53.627
Put a border on it,
that is your debugging tool.

67
00:03:53.627 --> 00:03:55.483
And by using our border box here,

68
00:03:55.483 --> 00:04:00.190
we are going to prevent bugs from showing
up on the page, particularly layout bugs,

69
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.327
where things slide underneath each
other when you're not expecting it.

70
00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:08.290
Sometimes that tiny little bit of
border is enough to bump things down.

71
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.165
And then after that, we just have
styling here on the body element.

72
00:04:12.165 --> 00:04:14.026
We're gonna leverage inheritance for this.

73
00:04:14.026 --> 00:04:17.060
We're gonna talk much more about
inheritance later on today.

74
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.650
But here on our body element,
we've applied our font family of Arial so

75
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.393
it's not so honking ugly, and we've
put in a slightly larger text size so

76
00:04:26.393 --> 00:04:27.714
that we can read it.

77
00:04:27.714 --> 00:04:32.674
&gt;&gt; So making a border or using a border
box, is that common practice for

78
00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:38.085
most, is that, I guess, best practices
when you start to develop then?

79
00:04:38.085 --> 00:04:39.182
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; On the front end?

80
00:04:39.182 --> 00:04:41.352
&gt;&gt; Yes, well, Bootstrap does it.

81
00:04:41.352 --> 00:04:42.725
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; If Bootstrap does it,

82
00:04:42.725 --> 00:04:44.503
it's probably right, right?

83
00:04:44.503 --> 00:04:49.613
&gt;&gt; I was just curious because
even with CSS in general,

84
00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:54.295
why they have it not
default to the most common?

85
00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:56.980
&gt;&gt; Gosh, isn't that a great question?

86
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.960
Why wouldn't they default to
what the most common one is?

87
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.530
Because we didn't used to
have border box the old days,

88
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.290
we always had the content box.

89
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.067
Border box came along later and
I think that's the reason why.

90
00:05:08.067 --> 00:05:12.119
Yeah, I think we're at the point where we
really should be defaulting to it, but

91
00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:14.334
I don't write the browser specs, so yeah.

92
00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:16.194
In my world, it would, [LAUGH] yes.

93
00:05:16.194 --> 00:05:21.480
&gt;&gt; I would just add to that pretty
much every CSS reset that kind of-

94
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.014
&gt;&gt; Yes.

95
00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:24.522
&gt;&gt; Include to start a project with-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

96
00:05:24.522 --> 00:05:26.238
&gt;&gt; Includes this line of code or

97
00:05:26.238 --> 00:05:29.815
this snippet of code to change
the box sizing to border box.

98
00:05:29.815 --> 00:05:32.694
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's just much more straightforward

99
00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:34.260
mental model.

100
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.547
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, yeah, normalized.css
&gt;&gt; Does Tailwind have it?

101
00:05:37.547 --> 00:05:39.479
Does anyone know?

102
00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.858
&gt;&gt; I'm sure if you look up any CSS reset,
it's always the top.

103
00:05:43.858 --> 00:05:45.600
&gt;&gt; Always at the top, and
this is the reason why.

104
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.451
So that's why it is what it is.

105
00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:52.375
And by the way the before, well,
as you know, there's a node, right?

106
00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:56.234
And using JavaScript terms, we have the
HTML element and that before and after,

107
00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:57.948
we have to select all those things.

108
00:05:57.948 --> 00:06:00.401
That's why it looks that crazy way,

109
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:04.130
because we wanna be sure to get before and
after as well.

110
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.349
&gt;&gt; Okay, everybody online okay?

111
00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:11.407
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

112
00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:14.090
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We're just kind of reiterating

113
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.723
the border box is including padding and
merging into the total width [INAUDIBLE].

114
00:06:19.723 --> 00:06:21.082
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.

115
00:06:21.082 --> 00:06:24.730
&gt;&gt; And then also echoing that, yeah.

116
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:31.850
It's this border box reset is in Tailwind
and essentially every framework.

117
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.846
&gt;&gt; Right, yeah.

118
00:06:32.846 --> 00:06:35.834
It adds in the border and the padding.

119
00:06:35.834 --> 00:06:40.850
The margin is always treated separate,
okay, just to clarify.

120
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.509
Yeah, you have a question, Ben.

121
00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.071
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just gonna say, I know I
guess I started thinking about it more,

122
00:06:46.071 --> 00:06:48.922
and is there a reason why
we only do the before and

123
00:06:48.922 --> 00:06:52.802
after pseudo selectors and not,
I mean, I know there are more.

124
00:06:52.802 --> 00:06:56.110
But it's not clear to me why
we only need before and after.

125
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.838
&gt;&gt; Mostly,
it has to do with the node in HTML.

126
00:06:59.838 --> 00:07:03.798
So you have the actual element itself,
and you have before and after the node.

127
00:07:03.798 --> 00:07:07.588
You can select those in JavaScript,
and we have them in CSS, too.

128
00:07:07.588 --> 00:07:09.820
That's why we're just using before and
after.

129
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.657
&gt;&gt; Okay, you kinda said that,
so I needed that.

130
00:07:11.657 --> 00:07:13.154
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

131
00:07:13.154 --> 00:07:14.372
Not a problem to repeat.
