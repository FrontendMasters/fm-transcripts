00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.110
The next concept I'd like to move
on to is talking about the Cascade.

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.609
And you're gonna find some of this
information to be a little bit surprising

3
00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.162
and a little bit unpredictable,
that's why we talked about inheritance and

4
00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:13.370
specificity first.

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.754
Inheritance and specificity are subsets
parts of the Cascade parts of figuring out

6
00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:26.960
how we are going to assign specific styles
to a given selector within our document.

7
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.033
And the interplay between these and the
Cascade is more in depth than you would

8
00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:37.200
expect in terms of just what is the order
that things are being presented.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.430
So let's get into that a little bit.

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.455
If you look up the cascade on MDN,

11
00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:45.980
they are going to describe
it in the following way.

12
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.732
So we'll go through this in a little bit
of detail and then I'll shorten it up for

13
00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:52.530
you so it's a little easier to remember.

14
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.470
So first of all, the very first thing that
you wanna do is go through and identify

15
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.090
all of the possible styles that will apply
to whatever it is that you're analyzing.

16
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.731
You need to look in media queries,
you need to look in at supports statements

17
00:01:07.731 --> 00:01:11.640
those are the ones that will
if it supports a given.

18
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.181
Structure and
CSS then execute these styles,

19
00:01:14.181 --> 00:01:18.150
you need to look at those you need
to look at something called layers.

20
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.040
Layers are brand new in CSS, I'm going
to talk about them extensively here in

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.503
a moment but you may have
layers inside of your CSS, and

22
00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:30.055
we need to take a look inside of those for
styles as well.

23
00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:35.949
Then what we're going to do is identify
the origins of all the styles that apply

24
00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:40.521
to that particular selection, we have to
look at their levels of importance and

25
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:42.584
we need to order them accordingly.

26
00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:46.714
So that would include things like
where are our browser style sheets,

27
00:01:46.714 --> 00:01:49.864
usually on our world that's
browser style sheets but

28
00:01:49.864 --> 00:01:54.560
it could be user agents we wanna take a
look at user style sheets remember again.

29
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.337
We may have some users that want to assign
their own style sheets to webpages to help

30
00:01:59.337 --> 00:02:01.980
them make them more readable.

31
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.945
We have author style sheets,
those come from multiple places.

32
00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.383
External style sheets,

33
00:02:06.383 --> 00:02:11.260
those are the separate documents we
typically work with in web development.

34
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.023
We may also have styles that appear
in the head of the document,

35
00:02:15.023 --> 00:02:16.600
those are extra sorry.

36
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.236
Those are embedded or
their internal documents and

37
00:02:20.236 --> 00:02:25.659
then we also have inline Styles as well
and we'll take a look at all of those.

38
00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:30.395
Then we need to sort those styles
again and to clear who wins based on

39
00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:34.719
specificity or remember inherited
plays into that as well.

40
00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.795
And then finally,
if the styles are of equal specificity,

41
00:02:38.795 --> 00:02:41.730
then the one that comes later wins.

42
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.425
So usually, when we think of the cascade,
we only think of that last one.

43
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:48.350
[LAUGH], the one that comes later wins,
as you can see,

44
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.540
there's actually a whole lot
more that comes before that.

45
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.650
And again, this leads to some of those
bugs that you're trying to debug,

46
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.255
and you cannot understand
why it doesn't work
