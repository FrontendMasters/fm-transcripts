00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.046
So you're ready for
one of my all time favorite tricks.

2
00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:06.120
This is where this comes in super handy so

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.967
again let's say that you live in
the world of content management systems.

4
00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:12.635
That's my deep background
I come from in Joomla,

5
00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:15.312
originally I do work with WordPress and
so forth.

6
00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:20.349
So, one of the things that happens
is your styling and maybe for

7
00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.635
accessibility purposes, you need to
flag every time somebody links to a PDF.

8
00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:30.306
Now exactly how likely it is
that your client is typing away.

9
00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:32.567
They're in their little editing window.

10
00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:36.831
That they're gonna stick a parenthesis
PDF after every link that has a PDF

11
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:37.736
on it, right.

12
00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:40.770
Yeah, zero it's just never gonna happen.

13
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.554
Wouldn't it be great if
we could program that?

14
00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:49.449
We can, using the arbitrary selectors.

15
00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:56.905
So, with that hint in mind,
how about I give you like three minutes.

16
00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:01.290
Think about how could you, so

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.202
using the attribute selectors,

18
00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:10.412
I don't tell you which one,

19
00:01:10.412 --> 00:01:16.036
you can pick select all links to PDFs.

20
00:01:16.036 --> 00:01:24.583
On the page and
put a PDF in parentheses after it.

21
00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:29.671
Okay, take three minutes and
see if you can write the selector.
