00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.712
So here on my div instead of
making this with a Flexbox,

2
00:00:06.712 --> 00:00:11.834
let's set this instead to display grid and

3
00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:18.108
we're gonna give this grid
template columns 2fr,

4
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:28.915
2fr, 3fr, so they give us
a little bit more space there,

5
00:00:28.915 --> 00:00:35.058
we can give this a little
bit of margin 1rem,

6
00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:40.733
Flex flow row wrap that's gonna go away,

7
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.586
We've got our border on the bottom,
we've got some padding, it's looking good.

8
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.714
Okay, so now I have grid going on here.

9
00:00:52.714 --> 00:00:56.930
And what I wanna have is all of
my dts to wind up on the left.

10
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.620
I want all of my dts to
wind up over on the right.

11
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.410
How might we go about doing that?

12
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.390
You may have any grid experts here.

13
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.720
How might we go about doing that?

14
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.660
Putting all of the dts on the left and
the dds over on the right.

15
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.487
So one of the things that we could
do here, Were reset my dd to auto.

16
00:01:19.487 --> 00:01:25.103
And for my dt, what I'm going to do is,

17
00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:31.076
set this to grid-column-start of one.

18
00:01:31.076 --> 00:01:37.544
So all of the dts will start
on the left hand side and

19
00:01:37.544 --> 00:01:44.330
then for
my dds will say grid-column-start what.

20
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.770
Two, right, that pushes everybody
over to the second column.

21
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.768
How cool is that?

22
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.126
And if you're not sure what's going on,
you can't see it.

23
00:02:03.126 --> 00:02:06.047
You can't style it,
you can always put a border on it.

24
00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:13.350
One pixel solid red on the dd.

25
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.930
One pixel border,
one pixel dotted blue on the dt and

26
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.080
that will help you better
visualize what's going on, right?

27
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.259
So if you wanna go back
to the Demo CodePen here,

28
00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.930
it's probably the easiest thing to do.

29
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.160
We can now test the rest of this list.

30
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.847
So if you go back to our disgusting,
revolting,

31
00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:42.025
inedible lima beans,
not that I have an opinion on them.

32
00:02:42.025 --> 00:02:46.310
Or yummy more please avocado, green grown,

33
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.383
garden grown tomatoes, sugar snap peas.

34
00:02:50.383 --> 00:02:55.050
We can copy all those divs and
we can drop them

35
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.719
into the list that we're
working on here and

36
00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.900
you see that now we have new issues right

37
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.060
It worked great for
our first two where we had a one to one

38
00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.527
relationship work great where
we had 1dt too many dds.

39
00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:22.849
But what's happening when we get too
many dts, but not necessarily many dds.

40
00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.865
Or they're mismatched in
terms of their numbers.

41
00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:29.384
Anyone have any ideas of what we
could do here, or what is happening?

42
00:03:29.384 --> 00:03:30.635
Why is this happening?

43
00:03:30.635 --> 00:03:32.255
Anyone have any idea
why this is happening?

44
00:03:35.753 --> 00:03:39.250
&gt;&gt; The dds are aligning to the last dt.

45
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.440
&gt;&gt; Correct the the dds
are aligning to the last dt.

46
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.420
&gt;&gt; Why is that?

47
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.620
No idea.

48
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.302
Okay, so
what's going on here is this is grid,

49
00:03:51.302 --> 00:03:54.804
grid tries really hard to guess
what you have in mind, right?

50
00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:58.383
So grid knows that it's gonna put
all the details over on the left, so

51
00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:00.245
there it is chunk, chunk, chunk.

52
00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:03.407
Puts up on the left,
we get to the last one and it goes, okay,

53
00:04:03.407 --> 00:04:06.569
now we have a dd I'm gonna put it
right next to that last one and

54
00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.310
then keep stacking them in on the dds.

55
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.140
So how can we push that back up to
the top, which is what we really want?

56
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.660
Any ideas?

57
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.320
&gt;&gt; With grid rows perhaps.

58
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.590
&gt;&gt; With grid rows, what a great idea.

59
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.760
So yeah, that is the answer.

60
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.190
&gt;&gt; And here is the trick to this.

61
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:34.658
If we put this on the dd, right,
and I said, grid hyphen row,

62
00:04:34.658 --> 00:04:40.126
hyphen start of 1, what's gonna happen?

63
00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:42.493
No, it did exactly what we told it to do.

64
00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:45.114
Dang it, I hate when that happens.

65
00:04:45.114 --> 00:04:49.166
Okay, so here we have told every
gd to start at the first row,

66
00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:54.496
which is exactly what it will do because
grid will allow for overlapping cells.

67
00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:58.157
So now we've just stacked all of
our text on top of each other.

68
00:04:58.157 --> 00:05:00.257
So that's not really what we want,

69
00:05:00.257 --> 00:05:05.090
we need to be a little bit more
specific about what we really want.

70
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.720
What would make this work?

71
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.720
We need something like dd first-child,
right?

72
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.260
Something like that,
problem is that doesn't work either.

73
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.450
Now why doesn't that work?

74
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.590
Any ideas online?

75
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.406
&gt;&gt; We're targeting the children of
the dd but we want to target the dd.

76
00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:32.980
&gt;&gt; You're getting close, we've said
dd first child, but it doesn't work.

77
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.890
Where is the first child dd in this HTML?

78
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.930
There isn't one because the first
child would have to be here, right?

79
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.730
This would have to be our first child.

80
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.070
That is a first child.

81
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.680
We don't have that, what we have instead
is, we have a dd it's down here.

82
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.850
It is called a first of type.

83
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.910
Okay, first of type.

84
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.230
And that will make this work.

85
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.160
So that is the difference
between first child and

86
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.738
child last child all those happy things.

87
00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:13.726
And the of-types,
which by the way all of those exist.

88
00:06:13.726 --> 00:06:17.429
First-of-type, last-of-type, only-of-type,

89
00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:22.573
end-of-type with all of the caveats and
last-of-type, all of those exist.

90
00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:27.956
They're either children or they're of
types and they work exactly the same way.

91
00:06:27.956 --> 00:06:32.875
This is the difference, it's not the first
child it's the first of its type.

92
00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:37.632
And once we do that, then we set our
first dd to show up there at the top of

93
00:06:37.632 --> 00:06:42.780
the column and all of the other
dds will fill in here underneath.

94
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.003
So we wind up with what
exactly we're looking for, and

95
00:06:46.003 --> 00:06:49.170
it looks way prettier if you
get rid of their borders.

96
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.730
I know you'll be shocked.

97
00:06:53.378 --> 00:06:55.900
Those are not attractive.

98
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.176
Although they are very useful.

99
00:07:03.697 --> 00:07:08.245
Okay, kind of nice?

100
00:07:08.245 --> 00:07:10.070
We could tighten that
up a little bit more.

101
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.904
We could push it a little further
with design, we can do all kinds of

102
00:07:13.904 --> 00:07:18.378
crazy things whereas one of the things
we could do we could stripe it, right?

103
00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:23.941
Div:nth-child(even),

104
00:07:27.037 --> 00:07:31.814
Background-color, light gray

105
00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:37.620
doesn't quite line up with our border.

106
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.290
I think I've got a margin in there
somewhere, or a padding or something.

107
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:48.550
We'll see, I've got a margin on my,
I've got a margin on my dev,

108
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:54.099
if I change that to a padding
Then that will tighten up nicely.

109
00:07:56.332 --> 00:08:00.060
&gt;&gt; On chat people saying
dropping knowledge bombs.

110
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.570
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Mind exploding emoji.

111
00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:06.830
&gt;&gt; Awesome, that's what I like to hear.

112
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.680
This is so much fun, isn't it?

113
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.870
Anytime you have these parents and
children and these relationships you can

114
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:17.270
apply Flexbox, you can apply grid, you
can do cool kinds of styling like this.

115
00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.661
And we do it because we have
the semantic HTML to work with.

116
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:25.354
We could do this with 27 layers of divs,
it just gets way more complicated than we

117
00:08:25.354 --> 00:08:28.290
have to drop in all the classes
that go with it here.

118
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.610
We're just working with
the patterns that we have.

119
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:31.487
This is a very cool trick.

120
00:08:31.487 --> 00:08:35.970
So yeah, feel free to use
that on your next website.

121
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:39.183
Now you're gonna look for
excuses to use description lists, and

122
00:08:39.183 --> 00:08:40.710
that would make me very happy.
