1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
All right, so let's take a look at
the HTML markup for our recipe.

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.047
Mark, did anyone share
a CodePen in the chat?

3
00:00:10.047 --> 00:00:14.493
So here we got John's markup here, and

4
00:00:14.493 --> 00:00:20.981
he has got the h1 on the title
of the page, which is fine.

5
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:24.011
I said that you could start
with h2 if you wanted,

6
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.762
he started with h1, that's totally cool.

7
00:00:26.762 --> 00:00:30.134
We've got our description
lists going on here.

8
00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:35.328
He's put a div to start that and
a /u here.

9
00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:38.690
That looks like maybe
a little bit of an error.

10
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.448
All right, moving on, and then we've got
our image, we've got our ingredients,

11
00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:46.139
he's done that with an unordered list,
okay?

12
00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:53.535
So in other words, we're saying that those
have to go in a certain order on the page.

13
00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:56.898
The preparation also has an ordered list.

14
00:00:56.898 --> 00:01:00.722
And then it looks like you probably
just ran out of time there.

15
00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:05.631
Yeah, okay, so
what was your reason that you marked

16
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:09.214
up ingredients with an ordered list?

17
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.450
&gt;&gt; Just looking now,
it could it be unordered.

18
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.110
&gt;&gt; It could be unordered, right?

19
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.756
Yeah, it's probably unordered,
because that's a list of ingredients.

20
00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:24.944
We may include them in that order.

21
00:01:24.944 --> 00:01:27.377
Often recipes write them in that order,
but

22
00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:30.155
they don't have to go
necessarily in that order.

23
00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.066
But the preparation is an ordered list,
totally agree with that.

24
00:01:33.066 --> 00:01:38.047
And by the way, I love the fact that
you did your description list up here

25
00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:41.701
at the top, where we've got serve,
6 people, and

26
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:45.626
the category is Philadelphia ice cream,
and so forth.

27
00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:48.785
I think that that's fantastic, okay?

28
00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.891
So nicely done.

29
00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:54.838
Here we've got Bogdan.

30
00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.281
Okay, so Bogdan, he started with
the h2 for the ice cream there.

31
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:05.907
And then he's got his
description list also,

32
00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:09.346
he's marked that up with the div,

33
00:02:09.346 --> 00:02:14.460
probably with an eye to
a little bit styling later.

34
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.369
And then there are ingredients are in h3,
we have our unordered list of ingredients.

35
00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:25.592
We have our preparation as an h3,
exactly how we're

36
00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:30.709
gonna go about preparing
that is in an ordered list.

37
00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.520
And then we get down to our
instructions for freezing.

38
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.494
So he marked that as an h3 and
then the needed equipment

39
00:02:38.494 --> 00:02:42.507
as an h4 with an unordered
list after that.

40
00:02:42.507 --> 00:02:46.868
That would be one way of doing this for
sure.

41
00:02:46.868 --> 00:02:51.576
Then we have, okay,
figure with a blockquote, which is,

42
00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:57.142
by the way, I love figure with blockquote,
I think that's awesome.

43
00:02:57.142 --> 00:03:00.857
But I'm not quite sure
why you put that there,

44
00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:06.773
possibly because you're quoting
the instructions from the book maybe.

45
00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:11.997
I would probably think of this as
an ordered list as well, because this

46
00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:18.030
is going to be a series of steps of how we
go about to freeze this particular thing.

47
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.363
And then, I see what you were doing,

48
00:03:20.363 --> 00:03:23.650
you were thinking of the citation
down here at the bottom.

49
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.925
So we've got our citation for
the name of the book,

50
00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:32.612
the cite element goes around that.

51
00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:40.189
And then we've got a photo down here
on the bottom with its caption as well.

52
00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:46.662
Okay, so that's a really fantastic job,
nice job there, Bogdan.

53
00:03:46.662 --> 00:03:49.526
And we've got Carolina.

54
00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:56.120
This is the last one here, let's just
take a quick peek at what she did.

55
00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.923
So Carolina here also started
with a description list.

56
00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:04.203
Once you start looking for
those description lists, man,

57
00:04:04.203 --> 00:04:05.945
they show up everywhere, it's just great.

58
00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.929
So she's got her h2,
she's got her description list.

59
00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:13.092
You missed the dl on the outside of that,
not a big deal, but

60
00:04:13.092 --> 00:04:18.026
you need a dl to start that particular
list, so that is missing there.

61
00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:21.409
Then we have our unordered
list of ingredients,

62
00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.809
our ordered list of preparation.

63
00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:28.811
And she also did an h4 plus the unordered
list for the equipment that

64
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:33.660
you're gonna need and then an ordered
list for the way to do this.

65
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.991
Okay, and, Yeah,

66
00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:42.934
this isn't quite what I had in mind for
the citation, but

67
00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:45.740
we'll go through that in just a moment.

68
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.267
So there's never really
always one right answer for

69
00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:53.370
how you mark things up, but
this is how I went about doing it.

70
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.351
So first of all,

71
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:58.837
I put this all in an article element,
because this is standalone content and

72
00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:02.572
this is a preview into the next
section that we're going into.

73
00:05:02.572 --> 00:05:05.320
This is a standalone content, we could
pull this out, put it on an index card,

74
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.250
and hand it around, and
people won't know what it is.

75
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.032
So it's syndicateable, so
you could consider this to be an article.

76
00:05:12.032 --> 00:05:16.462
Then we have our ice cream,
I have a div around this, that's for

77
00:05:16.462 --> 00:05:20.827
styling a little bit later, and
we have our description list.

78
00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:25.491
And then we have our h3,
I have an unordered list of ingredients,

79
00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:29.759
an h3 for preparation with
an ordered list of ingredients.

80
00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.908
So most people got those.

81
00:05:31.908 --> 00:05:37.037
And then for the instructions for
freezing, I actually took a different

82
00:05:37.037 --> 00:05:42.432
approach here, I think the h4 with
the unordered list is one possibility.

83
00:05:42.432 --> 00:05:45.373
I did it this way with
the description list again,

84
00:05:45.373 --> 00:05:50.002
where the needed equipment is the term,
and the equipment is the definition.

85
00:05:50.002 --> 00:05:54.072
So they kinda go together, right,
cuz here's the equipment that you need and

86
00:05:54.072 --> 00:05:55.684
here is the list of equipment.

87
00:05:55.684 --> 00:05:58.110
So they kinda go together that way.

88
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.576
And then an ordered list of instructions,
and

89
00:06:02.576 --> 00:06:07.622
then the citation markup
can be a little bit tricky.

90
00:06:07.622 --> 00:06:10.980
So again, we're previewing a little
bit into what we're going into next,

91
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.720
which are the big parts of the webpage.

92
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.662
You can put a footer at the bottom of
the article, so that's what I did here for

93
00:06:16.662 --> 00:06:17.460
the citation.

94
00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.478
And then put a paragraph
around the whole thing,

95
00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:25.261
and the cite element will go around the
name of the book where this comes from,

96
00:06:25.261 --> 00:06:30.140
which is the ice creams, water ices,
frozen puddings, blah, blah, blah.

97
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.032
That is where that goes, but
not including the name of the author.

98
00:06:35.032 --> 00:06:39.540
And then we've also credited Ahmed for
his picture down here on the bottom.

99
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.018
So that is how I marked it up, and
that's my justification for that.

100
00:06:45.018 --> 00:06:49.010
But again, I have a benefit of knowing
where we're headed in this course.

101
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.359
So I've thrown in a few elements
here you might not be familiar with,

102
00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:54.400
we will be getting to those momentarily.

103
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.892
All right, so we're ready for
the next part, which is,

104
00:06:58.892 --> 00:07:04.133
now that you've got your markup,
if you don't have your markup,

105
00:07:04.133 --> 00:07:09.580
I will put this CodePen in the collection,
which is on your website.

106
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.855
If you go to the website and
you go up here at the top where it says

107
00:07:13.855 --> 00:07:20.127
CodePen Collection, I am gonna put this in
right now, I'm gonna say list-markup only.

108
00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:27.298
Save that and
I will add that to the collection here.

109
00:07:27.298 --> 00:07:31.435
And you can take a quick peek at that.

110
00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:35.832
And so now, I wanna give you, let's say,
what, another 15 minutes or so

111
00:07:35.832 --> 00:07:38.804
to give you a crack at some of the CSS,
sounds good?

112
00:07:38.804 --> 00:07:43.637
Okay, so I'll show you mine while
people are thinking about whether

113
00:07:43.637 --> 00:07:46.399
they wanna share their CodePen or not.

114
00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:50.710
So we'll flip out over here
to my finished CodePen.

115
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:55.548
So a few things, basically the way
that I approach this type of process

116
00:07:55.548 --> 00:07:58.670
is exactly what we just
walked through here.

117
00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.846
So we start with our content and
we mark it up as semantically as possible.

118
00:08:03.846 --> 00:08:08.817
And then now, as we go into CSS,
now is when we might add additional div

119
00:08:08.817 --> 00:08:12.209
elements or
span elements if they're needed.

120
00:08:12.209 --> 00:08:17.621
Because those are really designed to
hold classes or JavaScript or whatever,

121
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:22.300
they're not really there to convey
any meaning about the webpage.

122
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.283
So if you've to through one passes to mark
it up, then the next passes to go through

123
00:08:26.283 --> 00:08:29.830
and think about the styling,
then you wind up with something like this.

124
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.642
So what I've got going on here is I've
added a div just to sort of show you

125
00:08:34.642 --> 00:08:38.593
where they are around
the description list and the image.

126
00:08:38.593 --> 00:08:41.720
And the idea here is,
I wanna put them side by side.

127
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.838
So I'm gonna do that with Flexbox or
Grid or something like that.

128
00:08:44.838 --> 00:08:48.518
And to be able to wrangle
those things in place,

129
00:08:48.518 --> 00:08:51.931
we need to have a div
around the whole thing.

130
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:55.783
So we have a div with the description
list, we have a div with the image, and

131
00:08:55.783 --> 00:08:58.839
then that gives me the parent,
the div, and the children,

132
00:08:58.839 --> 00:09:01.490
which would be the description list and
the image.

133
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.672
And now, I can put them side by side.

134
00:09:04.672 --> 00:09:09.234
For the ingredients, as you see here,
I put in a lovely little ice cream cone,

135
00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:13.061
because, that is just so cute,
right, for the unordered list.

136
00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:19.735
For the ordered list, I used some of those
emojis that have the numbers on them and

137
00:09:19.735 --> 00:09:23.774
I swapped those in for
the various ordered list.

138
00:09:23.774 --> 00:09:27.531
And then I put a color down there
in the footer at the bottom.

139
00:09:27.531 --> 00:09:29.304
So you can, of course,

140
00:09:29.304 --> 00:09:33.928
see my CodePen in the course
website if you take a look at that.

141
00:09:33.928 --> 00:09:37.846
And you can see exactly how
I went about styling this.

142
00:09:37.846 --> 00:09:41.680
I don't think there's anything in here
that's a curveball based on what I've gone

143
00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.090
through with you here before.

144
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:48.065
This is all pretty standard stuff, we went
through the trek, like the marker for

145
00:09:48.065 --> 00:09:49.762
the little ice cream cone.

146
00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:53.193
We went through the tricks
about the individual emoji,

147
00:09:53.193 --> 00:09:56.262
although it is worth showing
you how I set that up.

148
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.378
There's the freezing instructions.

149
00:09:58.378 --> 00:10:02.733
So we did the first child and child two
and child three and child four, right,

150
00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:07.095
because each of those need to have
a specific emoji associated with each one.

151
00:10:07.095 --> 00:10:10.009
So that's the way I've set that up, and

152
00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:13.967
I think those are pretty much
the high points of my CSS.

153
00:10:13.967 --> 00:10:19.495
But feel free to take a look at it, and
if you have questions, let us know.

154
00:10:19.495 --> 00:10:25.447
Anybody else have a CodePen that they'd
like to share for a look of the page?

155
00:10:25.447 --> 00:10:27.158
How to get the emoji?

156
00:10:27.158 --> 00:10:30.530
If you're talking about
how to pull them up,

157
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.008
I've got on my Mac, it's Cmd, Ctrl +pace.

158
00:10:34.008 --> 00:10:36.480
It brings up my emoji window here.

159
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.084
And if I clicked here in my CodePen, and

160
00:10:40.084 --> 00:10:45.452
then I click on the emoji,
it'll show up there in my code.

161
00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:48.156
But Windows people told me it was
something else, what was that again,

162
00:10:48.156 --> 00:10:50.413
John, for-
&gt;&gt; The Wiindows button and then period.

163
00:10:50.413 --> 00:10:51.613
&gt;&gt; The Windows button,

164
00:10:51.613 --> 00:10:55.419
plus the period in order to open up
the same emoji window in Windows.
