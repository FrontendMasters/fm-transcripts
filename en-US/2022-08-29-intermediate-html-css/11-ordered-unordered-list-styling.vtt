1
00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.273
Now we are moving on to that list
bullet styling that I just mentioned.

2
00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:08.925
So, we are on to part 2 here, ordered
an unordered list styling with pseudo

3
00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:12.140
classes and
you guys open up the beginning code pen.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.658
So, just as always, it's always good to
start anytime you take a look at any of

5
00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:18.789
these learning CSS types of things.

6
00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.351
You always want to take
a look at your HTML first and

7
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.885
get familiar with what it is.

8
00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:26.223
I've used really super simple
HTML structures today,

9
00:00:26.223 --> 00:00:31.134
so that you can easily carry them in your
head and then just concentrate on the CSS.

10
00:00:31.134 --> 00:00:34.913
So here we have an unordered
list with a class of an ordered.

11
00:00:34.913 --> 00:00:38.217
We have an ordered list
with a class of ordered and

12
00:00:38.217 --> 00:00:42.018
we have a nested list with
a class of nested spiffy cool.

13
00:00:42.018 --> 00:00:45.939
All right, so that way we can
work on three different things.

14
00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:50.281
The first thing I wanna work on are-

15
00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:58.752
The various types of children.

16
00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:02.218
So previously we had talked
about siblings and how we could

17
00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:06.758
select whether siblings are next to
each other or just generally siblings.

18
00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:10.116
But there are more specific ways
we can go about selecting these.

19
00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:13.625
And these are with the so-called
nth child classes.

20
00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:17.659
So there's a first child, there's last
child and there's an nth child, right?

21
00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.165
There's the oldest of the family,
there's the youngest of the family and

22
00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:21.449
then there's everybody in between.

23
00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:23.135
They're just n.

24
00:01:23.135 --> 00:01:27.038
[LAUGH] We don't really discriminate
between the ones in the middle.

25
00:01:27.038 --> 00:01:29.876
So let's go through how those might work.

26
00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:33.166
So I'm going to start all of
these off with unordered,

27
00:01:33.166 --> 00:01:37.397
because we're gonna use this first
list as the one to talk about this.

28
00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:42.049
So unordered li, first hyphen child.

29
00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.367
Any guess what this selector might select
before I put anything in his value?

30
00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.471
&gt;&gt; First element in the first
list in the third list.

31
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.131
&gt;&gt; Okay?

32
00:01:53.131 --> 00:01:57.180
So it's going to select
which one of these, Ben.

33
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.973
&gt;&gt; Here's the thing, the first ally.

34
00:01:58.973 --> 00:02:00.250
&gt;&gt; There's very first thing here.

35
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.183
Here's the thing, okay?

36
00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:08.486
Sure enough if we said color red,
it will select that first bullet item.

37
00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:13.808
Shockingly, right?

38
00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:15.822
Guess what happens if I said last child.

39
00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.928
&gt;&gt; A Lincoln nothing turns red,
&gt;&gt; A Lincoln a thing turns red.

40
00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:24.305
&gt;&gt; The second one I should say.

41
00:02:31.537 --> 00:02:33.328
&gt;&gt; Oops, what happened?

42
00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:35.641
Can you explain that?

43
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:39.068
&gt;&gt; The a element, so the UL or sorry,

44
00:02:39.068 --> 00:02:43.451
the Li element is
inheriting the color red.

45
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:47.810
However, the, A element that actually
makes up the content has its own color.

46
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.471
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; Is this is what we're saying.

47
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:51.949
&gt;&gt; Exactly, exactly what's going on.

48
00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:57.337
So Maybe you can just see there the dot is
red, but the link itself stayed blue and

49
00:02:57.337 --> 00:03:02.748
that's because that blue styling comes
from our default browser style sheet.

50
00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:06.168
We haven't overridden that yet
that has to do with inheritance,

51
00:03:06.168 --> 00:03:08.291
we will get there later on today, okay?

52
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:11.523
So that's first child,
that's last child, and in fact,

53
00:03:11.523 --> 00:03:14.250
we can just to prove to you
that this in fact works.

54
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.273
We could say ordered li last child and
the last child there would show up.

55
00:03:20.273 --> 00:03:23.406
Okay, so
that's first child that's last child.

56
00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:30.125
Those are pretty easy to understand,
then we have nth child.

57
00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:35.995
Nth child, okay, so
nth child starts off pretty simple.

58
00:03:35.995 --> 00:03:41.430
So we can put in any number
directly inside of nth child,

59
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.320
so I can say, nth child six and

60
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.191
that will select the six list item and
make it red.

61
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:52.898
This may seem completely useless
that's what people usually tell me at

62
00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:56.676
this moment in time, Jen this is
the most useless trick I've ever seen.

63
00:03:56.676 --> 00:04:00.399
Why would I want to make
the sixth child red?

64
00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.918
And I agree with you in this context but

65
00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:06.708
there is a very cool trick
associated with the selector.

66
00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:09.697
I'm going to show you a little
bit later on today, but

67
00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:11.301
that is one thing you can do.

68
00:04:11.301 --> 00:04:15.999
So just put in a number whatever number,
if that number exists,

69
00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:17.919
then it will be selected.

70
00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.678
We count like humans in CSS, so we start
with one not with zero, [LAUGH] okay?

71
00:04:23.678 --> 00:04:29.974
And so if I said nth-child 1, that would
be the same thing as saying first child.

72
00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:34.855
All right, so that's the easy one.

73
00:04:34.855 --> 00:04:37.097
Then we have the next
one that's really easy.

74
00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:39.401
We can say odd or even.

75
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.164
I'm getting bored with that,
let's make it a background color.

76
00:04:48.164 --> 00:04:52.063
Odd or even, so
odd we'll start with the first child,.

77
00:04:52.063 --> 00:04:56.751
In this case, number one and then count
by odd numbers, one, three, five,

78
00:04:56.751 --> 00:04:59.291
seven, nine, etc until the end of time.

79
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:01.676
This seems much more useful, yes?

80
00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:06.088
Imagined in table structures
this is a way you can

81
00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:10.079
stripe your table rows very easily, okay?

82
00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:15.473
Guess, what else I can
use as a key word here?

83
00:05:15.473 --> 00:05:18.126
&gt;&gt; Prime.

84
00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:20.918
&gt;&gt; Not prime, even.

85
00:05:20.918 --> 00:05:25.980
[LAUGH] And shockingly,
that will do the opposite,

86
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.290
okay/ So
now we select the even number guys, right?

87
00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.166
Very useful, very useful, you'll see
I didn't even use it all the time.

88
00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:41.111
Then we get to the last
one which is just weird.

89
00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:44.139
Let's say, if I said this, 3n.

90
00:05:47.116 --> 00:05:52.066
3n, this starts to look like algebra,
okay?

91
00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:55.400
So 3n is doing what?

92
00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.648
&gt;&gt; Every third element.

93
00:05:56.648 --> 00:06:03.158
&gt;&gt; Every third element, so one,
two, three, four, five, six.

94
00:06:03.158 --> 00:06:07.040
And then I don't have a nine, so
that's as far as it gets, all right?

95
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.609
So three n that is what that can do and
of course,

96
00:06:10.609 --> 00:06:14.110
we can then make it four n or
whatever, right?

97
00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.002
We can continue on with that pattern.

98
00:06:20.141 --> 00:06:22.953
Then the weird part comes and

99
00:06:22.953 --> 00:06:28.471
the weird part is when we say
something like, plus two.

100
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.926
I'm pologize to all of you who
are flashing back to algebra, but

101
00:06:32.926 --> 00:06:35.330
I promise you this is not algebra.

102
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.211
So what is this saying?

103
00:06:37.211 --> 00:06:42.989
Anyone have a guess what 3n+2 would mean?

104
00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:49.637
&gt;&gt; So the value of n is what spot in the
list we're in, and then so we'll add 2.

105
00:06:49.637 --> 00:06:53.953
So, the second element is
highlighted because n is 0, and so

106
00:06:53.953 --> 00:06:58.767
therefore that second one gets selected
and then we have the fifth and

107
00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:01.923
the eighth, which are valid for
n equals 2.

108
00:07:01.923 --> 00:07:04.626
&gt;&gt; Very cool, very cool and very close.

109
00:07:04.626 --> 00:07:07.180
The end doesn't really mean
anything I don't think.

110
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.845
[LAUGH] Can't think of this as algebra.

111
00:07:10.845 --> 00:07:16.426
So with the plus sign the plus two means
we're going to start with the second one.

112
00:07:16.426 --> 00:07:21.496
So notice that we started there with
number two and then we're going to follow

113
00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:26.258
the pattern of every third one starting
with the second item on the list.

114
00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:30.433
Every third element starting with
the second one on the list, so

115
00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:34.080
Dan I know you were saying this
was new for you last week.

116
00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.778
&gt;&gt; So isn't this still algebra?

117
00:07:36.778 --> 00:07:38.481
&gt;&gt; No, there is no algebra.

118
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:41.865
It looks like algebra I know,
don't try to solve it,

119
00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:44.210
don't try to think of it as algebra.

120
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.937
I don't know why they chose
to write it this way, but

121
00:07:47.937 --> 00:07:53.531
that last number there after the plus
sign tells you which child to start with,

122
00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:58.873
in this case, the second child and then-
&gt;&gt; It'd be putting each value of,

123
00:07:58.873 --> 00:08:04.729
like zero into n, 1, n 2 n and then 2 and
n and you'd get each number correct.

124
00:08:04.729 --> 00:08:09.384
If you put n equals zero, you get two,
n equals one, you get five and

125
00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:11.855
you're getting each one of those.

126
00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:13.623
I can't stop thinking of it that way.

127
00:08:13.623 --> 00:08:14.667
&gt;&gt; Okay.

128
00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:20.886
If the math works, then then that's great,
but I think of it as the last number and

129
00:08:20.886 --> 00:08:26.851
number two is where you start and then
the three n just indicates every third n.

130
00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:33.462
&gt;&gt; Then is there a reason
it's not zero indexed?

131
00:08:33.462 --> 00:08:35.799
&gt;&gt; As in why don't they start with zero?

132
00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:36.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

133
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.922
&gt;&gt; Because it's CSS and
it's for designers and

134
00:08:39.922 --> 00:08:43.723
they kind of like humans
[LAUGH] Like engineers.

135
00:08:43.723 --> 00:08:48.750
All right, so with that part of info
child understood, a single number odd and

136
00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.323
even keywords or the weird algebra
looking thing that's not algebra,

137
00:08:53.323 --> 00:08:54.941
stop thinking that way.

138
00:08:54.941 --> 00:09:00.485
The reverse is also true here,
we can also say nth- last- child and

139
00:09:00.485 --> 00:09:06.149
last child this counts up from
the last child and assigns the styles.

140
00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:10.399
So now we're counting from the bottom,
this is the second one and

141
00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:13.343
then every third one from the bottom,
okay?

142
00:09:13.343 --> 00:09:15.816
Likewise, we can do add in
even from the bottom up.

143
00:09:15.816 --> 00:09:20.326
We can also do a regular old
number from the bottom up.

144
00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:23.558
This would select the second
one from the bottom.

145
00:09:23.558 --> 00:09:27.438
Make sense?

146
00:09:27.438 --> 00:09:31.847
Okay, some of these feel a little bit
esoteric, and a lot of ways I think

147
00:09:31.847 --> 00:09:36.126
nth child is the one that pretty
much everybody uses in programming.

148
00:09:36.126 --> 00:09:41.104
But if for whatever reason counting from
the bottom is simpler this is possible.

149
00:09:41.104 --> 00:09:44.608
What would happen if I put in
a minus sign here instead?

150
00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:50.109
So if I go back to my nth child and
I put in a minus sign between 3n- 2.

151
00:09:50.109 --> 00:09:51.151
What does that mean?

152
00:09:55.197 --> 00:10:00.444
&gt;&gt; I'd assume it would move
the starting position, quote, unquote,

153
00:10:00.444 --> 00:10:04.972
back, in determining which
items to actually highlight.

154
00:10:04.972 --> 00:10:07.506
&gt;&gt; Okay, move the starting position back.

155
00:10:09.614 --> 00:10:10.381
So, yeah.

156
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.083
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

157
00:10:11.083 --> 00:10:12.829
&gt;&gt; Yeap, that's pretty much it.
