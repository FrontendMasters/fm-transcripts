00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.270
Thanks so much for watching this course.

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.582
And I just wanted to
do a quick summary for

3
00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:09.600
you of all of the things that you've
learned over this entire course.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.894
So first of all, semantic HTML is gonna
help with search engine optimization,

5
00:00:14.894 --> 00:00:19.637
helps with accessibility, and
it allows for interesting selectors,

6
00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:23.440
broadening that CSS range for
fine-tune styling.

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.710
You don't have to use 15
different classes on something.

8
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.169
You don't have to worry about if somebody
reorders the buttons that are all

9
00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:32.746
in a row.

10
00:00:32.746 --> 00:00:35.629
If they're still gonna be styled
in the way that you want.

11
00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.953
If you're writing robust selectors
that are based on your HTML,

12
00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:43.647
then you're going to wind up
with flexible styling that

13
00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:48.149
is gonna stay in place even as users
wind up changing your document.

14
00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.724
Remember that CSS selectors are broad,

15
00:00:50.724 --> 00:00:53.610
classes don't have to
be your first choice.

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.550
In fact,
classes should be your last choice.

17
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.150
Classes are the exceptions to the rule.

18
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.843
Classes give you an easy way of selecting
something to make it an exception to

19
00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:03.600
the rule.

20
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.049
You have so
many other tools in your tool chest for

21
00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.270
getting things to style
the way you want it.

22
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.624
CSS is about pattern matching.

23
00:01:12.624 --> 00:01:17.610
And I would encourage you to have this as
one of the big takeaways from this course,

24
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.885
when you're matching patterns of
your HTML, that's what CSS does.

25
00:01:21.885 --> 00:01:27.219
It's gonna look for those patterns in your
HTML and apply the styles accordingly.

26
00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.908
When you use classes,
you kinda disrupt that process.

27
00:01:29.908 --> 00:01:33.450
You're adding a little
pointer that says right here,

28
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.880
this thing right here,
that is where I want my style.

29
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.254
Sometimes that is exactly what you need,
but

30
00:01:40.254 --> 00:01:43.500
it doesn't necessarily have
to be that way all the time.

31
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.266
So remember that you can pattern match,
and

32
00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:50.989
pattern matching may lead to a more
robust solution to what you're doing.

33
00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:55.403
Inheritance, is gonna cause, more weird
things to happen than you'd expect.

34
00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:59.708
So, as you think about things that you
kind of know about CSS and the cascade,

35
00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:03.831
you think about the order of styles,
you think about their specificity.

36
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:06.474
Inheritance tends to be
the one that is forgotten.

37
00:02:06.474 --> 00:02:08.497
And inheritance is very powerful and

38
00:02:08.497 --> 00:02:11.180
it can lead to some of
those unexpected results.

39
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.926
So, if you can remember that the inherited
styles typically apply to text in

40
00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:17.272
some way or another.

41
00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:20.616
The font styles,
the text styles and so forth,

42
00:02:20.616 --> 00:02:25.894
those are the ones you need to watch out
for when you are debugging your CSS.

43
00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:28.850
Specificity and
the Cascade are predictable.

44
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.060
They are not simple, they are not
without rules but they are predictable.

45
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.350
Once you truly understand what's going
on with specificity in the cascade,

46
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.550
you know exactly what's going to
happen to your styles along the way.

47
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.144
And of course, you can visualize
that inside of your developer tools.

48
00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:52.745
And finally you can explain everything
that is happening in CSS with

49
00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:55.177
enough time studying these rules.

50
00:02:55.177 --> 00:02:59.393
I gave you an exercise along the way that
helps you explain what's happening with

51
00:02:59.393 --> 00:03:00.511
the styling and why.

52
00:03:00.511 --> 00:03:04.700
I would encourage you to continue that
process, to sharpen these skills.

53
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.941
The next time you are working with CSS,
take a look at something and

54
00:03:08.941 --> 00:03:14.020
see if you can explain why it looks
the way it looks inside of your document.

55
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.920
It'll help cement these
rules inside your mind.

56
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.454
And it will encourage you and
increase your confidence so

57
00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:24.470
that you're gonna be better
at these rules in the future.

58
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.323
Thanks again so much for watching you,

59
00:03:26.323 --> 00:03:28.976
it's been a lot of fun
presenting this material to you.

60
00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:34.070
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; We should ask.
