1
00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:04.706
Okay, so
our last kind of list is the menu list.

2
00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:09.993
And I am going to open this
up in a new tab for you.

3
00:00:09.993 --> 00:00:17.529
And so menu lists are designed to be
used where you have a series of buttons.

4
00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.714
And this leads into a discussion
about buttons versus links.

5
00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:25.562
So let's talk about that first
before we get into the styling.

6
00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:34.372
So the menu link or the, I'm sorry,
the menu element is designed for

7
00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:39.444
interactive elements,
like the HTML button element.

8
00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:45.682
In other words, anytime that clickable
things in HTML, there's two of them,

9
00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:51.284
there's A, as in Ahref, and
there are buttons, as in button, okay?

10
00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:56.975
And the difference here is that A, Ahref,
when you click that, you go somewhere.

11
00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:00.013
You go within the page,
you go to another page on the site,

12
00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:01.320
you go to a page off site.

13
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.264
It's a traveling kind of thing.

14
00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.920
We're going somewhere with links.

15
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.843
When you click a button, HTML button,
we are interested in executing something.

16
00:01:12.843 --> 00:01:14.026
So generally speaking,

17
00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:17.586
there's gonna be some kind of JavaScript
associated with those buttons.

18
00:01:17.586 --> 00:01:20.638
In whatever way you wanna do it,
I'm not suggesting, here,

19
00:01:20.638 --> 00:01:23.761
we're trying to suggest that
onclick is the way to do a button.

20
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:25.381
I am not a JavaScript person.

21
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.337
Don't pay any attention
to me in that regard.

22
00:01:28.337 --> 00:01:32.938
I actually copied this off of
the MDN site as their example.

23
00:01:32.938 --> 00:01:37.408
But however it is that you're making
these buttons, do their button thing,

24
00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:42.113
that is something that would wind up being
marked up as specifically as a button.

25
00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:47.367
So here's an example of perhaps a button
group, where we would be cut, copy, paste.

26
00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:51.854
As I said earlier, an email,
set of buttons where we had reply,

27
00:01:51.854 --> 00:01:54.845
reply all, forward, that kind of thing,

28
00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:59.853
that those groups of buttons are a great
place to use this menu element.

29
00:01:59.853 --> 00:02:03.745
So that is the difference between A and
button.

30
00:02:03.745 --> 00:02:06.394
And that is what menu is for.

31
00:02:06.394 --> 00:02:11.356
I'll mention down here that those of
you who are thinking about navigation,

32
00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:13.660
navigation is different, right?

33
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.148
Navigation is an unordered list of
links that goes somewhere else,

34
00:02:18.148 --> 00:02:21.453
usually on the same website,
but occasionally,

35
00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:25.799
you might have one that goes off
to social media or whatever else.

36
00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.571
Those are specifically going somewhere,
when you click it,

37
00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.825
you're traveling to another page.

38
00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:36.929
And so that type of navigation will
be marked up with an unordered list,

39
00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:38.472
not with a menu list.

40
00:02:38.472 --> 00:02:40.854
Even though we call this a menu,

41
00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:44.657
that is not menu in the HTML
definition of the term.

42
00:02:44.657 --> 00:02:45.710
Does that help?

43
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.596
Sort of draw some bright lines between
menu and navigation and buttons and links.

44
00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:53.259
Sound good?

45
00:02:55.827 --> 00:03:00.504
Okay, so one of the popular things
in frameworks like Bootstrap is

46
00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:05.348
styling a button group, right,
where you have a cool looking little

47
00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:10.207
bar that's got all your buttons and
it's got all your hover states.

48
00:03:10.207 --> 00:03:14.551
So let's go through how we
might doing exactly that.

49
00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:18.910
And I'm gonna do it here using
this menu with the class of group.

50
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.246
Let's go through how we can
write our own styling for

51
00:03:21.246 --> 00:03:23.332
that without having to
leverage a framework.

52
00:03:27.215 --> 00:03:32.495
Okay, so
we'll start with our class of group,

53
00:03:32.495 --> 00:03:38.310
which is also the menu,
that's the top level list.

54
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.943
And, Here we go.

55
00:03:44.943 --> 00:03:45.918
We're gonna set this up.

56
00:03:45.918 --> 00:03:52.420
So we can say list-style-type: none,
right?

57
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.363
That's usually the first thing that you're
gonna wanna do, turn off the bullets.

58
00:03:56.363 --> 00:04:01.245
If you're not using a reset stylesheet,
like normalize,

59
00:04:01.245 --> 00:04:05.834
etc., you're gonna say margin: 0,
padding: 0,

60
00:04:05.834 --> 00:04:12.493
because you don't know what browsers are
gonna do with that from place to place.

61
00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:16.574
Then you can say something
like display: flex.

62
00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:22.324
Of course, you could do grid with
this too, that would be totally fine.

63
00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:26.042
But considering we have
one row of buttons here,

64
00:04:26.042 --> 00:04:30.038
Flexbox is a perfectly
reasonable choice for this.

65
00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:33.322
So display: flex, flex-flow: row wrap.

66
00:04:33.322 --> 00:04:39.545
And then we can justify-content in the
center, because that's prettier, right?

67
00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:46.480
Okay, so that sort of gets
our buttons all together.

68
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.469
The bones of the structure that we're
looking for in terms of a button group.

69
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:52.494
Then we can add styling to that.

70
00:04:55.316 --> 00:04:58.334
So within our menu group,
we have a button, and

71
00:04:58.334 --> 00:05:02.494
that button probably needs some
styling in order to look decent.

72
00:05:02.494 --> 00:05:07.314
So let's do that, button-color,

73
00:05:07.314 --> 00:05:12.446
oops, background-color:purple.

74
00:05:15.445 --> 00:05:17.605
Color: white.

75
00:05:17.605 --> 00:05:22.594
So we have good contrast and
we can read what's on there.

76
00:05:26.744 --> 00:05:30.838
Font-weight: bold,
make it a little easier to see.

77
00:05:30.838 --> 00:05:36.899
We might juice up the font-size:1.2rem,
okay?

78
00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:42.043
Those ugly little gray lines that
go around those, that's our border.

79
00:05:42.043 --> 00:05:46.467
So we can say border: none.

80
00:05:46.467 --> 00:05:50.644
Remember a lot of the stuff, the styling
was established back in the 90s when we

81
00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:53.232
were really into those
beveled looking buttons.

82
00:05:53.232 --> 00:05:56.686
A lot of that done with borders,
so you can just kill that.

83
00:05:56.686 --> 00:06:03.127
Padding is 0.5rem,
give it a little breathable space.

84
00:06:03.127 --> 00:06:11.637
And we can give it a margin, Of 1rem 0.

85
00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:16.535
So that'll just give us a little bit of
room to get us off the edges of the box

86
00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:17.957
that goes around it.

87
00:06:17.957 --> 00:06:25.547
Okay, Now,

88
00:06:25.547 --> 00:06:28.268
now comes the fun part.

89
00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:31.888
We love our rounded corners, don't we?

90
00:06:31.888 --> 00:06:33.920
And in a button group like this,

91
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.528
we probably wanna round the corners
of the outside buttons, don't we?

92
00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:42.809
Yeah, [LAUGH] that's exactly what
they were just thinking over here.

93
00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:46.359
Okay, that's awesome, but we would
like some rounded corners, please.

94
00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:51.608
Well, you can leverage your old friends,
last-child and first-child.

95
00:06:51.608 --> 00:06:55.565
And that's a great application here
to put those right on these buttons.

96
00:06:55.565 --> 00:06:59.983
So let's take a look at that.

97
00:06:59.983 --> 00:07:05.932
We can say .group li:first-child button,
right?

98
00:07:05.932 --> 00:07:08.769
The first list item and the button.

99
00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:12.311
Why didn't I just say button:first-child?

100
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.241
Why didn't I just say button:first-child?

101
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:26.413
Cuz it is the first-child, right?

102
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:43.792
No, So
if I just said button:first-child and

103
00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:46.946
we'll set the background color to be blue,
all of the buttons are blue.

104
00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:49.515
How can they all be first-children?

105
00:07:49.515 --> 00:07:50.948
Anybody have an answer to that?

106
00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:59.213
&gt;&gt; Because all the buttons are first
children of the list of items.

107
00:07:59.213 --> 00:08:01.255
&gt;&gt; All the buttons are first children.

108
00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:06.127
They are children of the list item, and
they're, in fact, only-child, last-child,

109
00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:08.740
or first-child will match those,
[LAUGH] okay?

110
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.033
So that's what's going on there,

111
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:15.550
that's why you can't necessarily
just say button:first-child.

112
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:21.896
You're gonna wanna say li:first-child
to select the first list item,

113
00:08:21.896 --> 00:08:26.205
as you can see there, and
then we want the button.

114
00:08:26.205 --> 00:08:31.380
And as always, feel free to throw in
the background-color or something to make

115
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:36.568
sure you're selecting the right one
before you add additional styles to that.

116
00:08:36.568 --> 00:08:41.922
So now, what I can say is, now that I
know I've got the right one, I could say

117
00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:47.640
padding on the left would be 1rem, give
you a little bit more space on that side.

118
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.502
And then we can say our
border-radius will be something like

119
00:08:51.502 --> 00:08:55.750
whatever makes you happy,
you probably have a variable for this.

120
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.636
Hopefully, you have a variable for this,

121
00:08:58.636 --> 00:09:04.328
because if you're rounding corners here,
you're rounding corners everywhere,

122
00:09:04.328 --> 00:09:09.234
and they all have to be the same,
that kind of lends itself to a variable.

123
00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:15.461
But in any case, we wanna round just
the top left and the top bottom, right?

124
00:09:15.461 --> 00:09:20.591
So by doing it this way, we have
given us a little bit of extra room.

125
00:09:20.591 --> 00:09:25.983
We've rounded that, and
then of course, as you can imagine,

126
00:09:25.983 --> 00:09:30.583
the last one is gonna look
very much the same, right?

127
00:09:30.583 --> 00:09:32.623
Except what am I gonna change here?

128
00:09:32.623 --> 00:09:34.552
Anybody have any ideas?

129
00:09:34.552 --> 00:09:35.593
&gt;&gt; Li:last-child.

130
00:09:35.593 --> 00:09:39.441
&gt;&gt; It's gonna be the last-child now,
right?

131
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:41.572
Then what?

132
00:09:41.572 --> 00:09:45.781
&gt;&gt; Invert the border-radius to 0770.

133
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:48.173
&gt;&gt; Okay, change the border-radius, so

134
00:09:48.173 --> 00:09:52.673
it's 0770 because it's the opposite
corners that we want rounded.

135
00:09:52.673 --> 00:09:54.297
Anything else?

136
00:09:54.297 --> 00:09:57.427
&gt;&gt; You did padding-left, so padding-right.

137
00:09:57.427 --> 00:09:58.037
&gt;&gt; Padding-right.

138
00:09:58.037 --> 00:10:01.167
There we go.

139
00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.612
Very pretty, okay?

140
00:10:03.612 --> 00:10:05.767
And now, here's the advantage.

141
00:10:05.767 --> 00:10:11.236
So when I decide that I wanna put
in more buttons here, I don't know.

142
00:10:15.626 --> 00:10:19.115
The boss had me add it, [LAUGH] okay?

143
00:10:19.115 --> 00:10:24.364
So when you have to add
more buttons to your menu,

144
00:10:24.364 --> 00:10:30.527
look, they're automatically styled,
aren't they?

145
00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:35.092
So even if I grab my paste,
oops, grab my paste button here,

146
00:10:37.013 --> 00:10:42.093
And I want the boss had me style it,
that's now my outside button.

147
00:10:42.093 --> 00:10:44.735
See how I don't have to mess
around with any classes.

148
00:10:47.362 --> 00:10:50.059
Very nice, right?
Makes your maintenance much, much easier,

149
00:10:50.059 --> 00:10:52.580
especially if you have other users who,
well,

150
00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.565
I'm not sure that other users are gonna
be adding buttons to your menu bar.

151
00:10:56.565 --> 00:11:00.720
But who knows, maybe the UX person has
to wind up having to add something or

152
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.676
whatever and they're not quite sure
exactly what you have going on for

153
00:11:04.676 --> 00:11:05.766
the programming.

154
00:11:05.766 --> 00:11:09.680
So this becomes very robust
styling that just applies.

155
00:11:12.128 --> 00:11:15.199
How're you doing so far, okay?

156
00:11:15.199 --> 00:11:19.710
Okay, now,
just to show you the difference here.

157
00:11:23.438 --> 00:11:26.046
I forgot to add a hover state, didn't I?

158
00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:31.618
I didn't add a hover state to my buttons.

159
00:11:31.618 --> 00:11:37.376
So we can add that, .group button:hover,

160
00:11:37.376 --> 00:11:43.750
and that would be
background-color: thistle.

161
00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:47.330
And I think I had a color there too.

162
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:52.075
Yep, color: purple.

163
00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:52.708
So there we go.
Now,

164
00:11:52.708 --> 00:11:56.503
you have your hover state
there on the buttons too.

165
00:11:56.503 --> 00:11:57.003
So fantastic.

166
00:12:00.866 --> 00:12:03.048
Now, here's the amazing thing.

167
00:12:03.048 --> 00:12:04.709
You just turned that into a button group.

168
00:12:04.709 --> 00:12:09.212
That's a pretty common pattern that
you have for JavaScript based buttons.

169
00:12:09.212 --> 00:12:13.834
You can actually use this exact
same CSS to apply to your navbar.

170
00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.939
You just need different selectors.

171
00:12:15.939 --> 00:12:20.071
This is one of
the interesting things here.

172
00:12:20.071 --> 00:12:26.044
So up here at the top, where we
start with group, if we said nav ul,

173
00:12:26.044 --> 00:12:31.296
it applies all of those styles
to our navigation, right?

174
00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:37.650
Be sure to look at your HTML if
you're lost along the way here.

175
00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:42.207
We can then say for our group button,

176
00:12:42.207 --> 00:12:46.179
that's analogous to our nav a.

177
00:12:46.179 --> 00:12:46.679
There they are.

178
00:12:52.038 --> 00:12:57.882
Nav a, yep, and
we have a nav a hover down here.

179
00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:05.204
So we can hover over those buttons.

180
00:13:05.204 --> 00:13:06.705
And we have a,

181
00:13:12.355 --> 00:13:19.518
What would be the selector here, For
our group li:first-child button?

182
00:13:19.518 --> 00:13:26.802
What would be the analog here in
the navbar, For that selector?

183
00:13:26.802 --> 00:13:28.836
So, I'm gonna write a similar selector.

184
00:13:28.836 --> 00:13:31.038
What's it gonna look like?

185
00:13:31.038 --> 00:13:37.749
Look something like nav li:first-child a,
right?

186
00:13:42.338 --> 00:13:45.397
Nav li:last-child.

187
00:13:54.407 --> 00:13:58.474
So then the only things that were missing
here that you have to worry about with

188
00:13:58.474 --> 00:14:00.917
a navigation bar,
an actual navigation bar,

189
00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:03.564
as opposed to a button
group is those underlines.

190
00:14:03.564 --> 00:14:09.083
So we could also say, nav a,
a couple of two things,

191
00:14:09.083 --> 00:14:12.981
text-decoration: none; right?

192
00:14:12.981 --> 00:14:15.967
We don't want those unsightly underlines.

193
00:14:15.967 --> 00:14:21.827
And then the other very,
very important thing is to display: block.

194
00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:22.888
Why do we do that?

195
00:14:22.888 --> 00:14:26.814
Not only because it fits
much nicer in its container,

196
00:14:26.814 --> 00:14:32.234
which is a side benefit, but because
we wind up with big clickable areas.

197
00:14:32.234 --> 00:14:38.046
See how I can just hit the edge of my
button there, and I've selected it, okay?

198
00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:43.185
Without display: block on that a,
a is inline.

199
00:14:43.185 --> 00:14:50.029
So therefore, I have to be over the text
itself in order for it to be seen.

200
00:14:50.029 --> 00:14:54.687
So that is the benefit of
adding display block on the A.

201
00:14:54.687 --> 00:14:58.533
&gt;&gt; What's the difference between
list-style-type: none and

202
00:14:58.533 --> 00:14:59.918
list-style: none?

203
00:14:59.918 --> 00:15:03.194
&gt;&gt; There is no difference between
list-style-type of none and

204
00:15:03.194 --> 00:15:04.394
list-style: none.

205
00:15:04.394 --> 00:15:08.751
Originally, list-style was shorthand for
a couple of image properties,

206
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.861
I think it's list-style-type and

207
00:15:10.861 --> 00:15:15.642
list-style-image and a couple of other
things that you could stack up together.

208
00:15:15.642 --> 00:15:20.555
Kind of the font property you can stack
up inside of the single line of CSS,

209
00:15:20.555 --> 00:15:25.005
you can stack up a size and a color and
font family and a line height.

210
00:15:25.005 --> 00:15:27.811
You can put all that in the font family,

211
00:15:27.811 --> 00:15:31.228
list-style used to be
that same kind of thing.

212
00:15:31.228 --> 00:15:34.978
But list-style-type
are pretty interchangeable.

213
00:15:34.978 --> 00:15:40.048
&gt;&gt; Why do we have menu li
instead of menu ul or li?

214
00:15:40.048 --> 00:15:41.978
&gt;&gt; Okay, because that's a great question.

215
00:15:41.978 --> 00:15:42.580
I'm glad you asked that.

216
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:48.709
That's because menu is
the actual type of list.

217
00:15:48.709 --> 00:15:52.010
This is a new kind of list, the menu list.

218
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:59.406
And so it's not a wrapper that
you put around your ul's,

219
00:15:59.406 --> 00:16:04.040
it's like ul, ol, dl, and menu.

220
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:06.370
Those are the analogous elements.

221
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:10.889
&gt;&gt; Could you please repeat the portion
on why not to use the menu with

222
00:16:10.889 --> 00:16:12.405
a navigation links?

223
00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:17.263
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so menu, semantically speaking,
is designed for interactive lists.

224
00:16:17.263 --> 00:16:21.455
So in other words,
a list it's gonna contain a bunch of

225
00:16:21.455 --> 00:16:26.293
things when you click a,
we are not going to go somewhere else.

226
00:16:26.293 --> 00:16:31.031
Okay, so a link A, the link tag
is designed to go somewhere else,

227
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:35.697
whether that's within the page
on your site or page off-site.

228
00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:37.993
That's what that is all about.

229
00:16:37.993 --> 00:16:41.218
So we mark those up with
an unordered list and with links.

230
00:16:41.218 --> 00:16:43.343
Menu, we use with buttons, and

231
00:16:43.343 --> 00:16:47.062
we are going to program those
buttons with JavaScript.

232
00:16:47.062 --> 00:16:50.444
So that's the difference,
we have a list of JavaScript functions or

233
00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:52.148
we have a list of basic HTML links.
