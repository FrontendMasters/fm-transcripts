1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.346
Let's start coding now.

2
00:00:01.346 --> 00:00:05.819
And at this point, what you'll need to
do in order to follow along with me,

3
00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.026
there's not gonna be any code pens.

4
00:00:08.026 --> 00:00:09.227
Because of course,

5
00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:13.687
code pen will only allow us to type in
that little CSS window that's there.

6
00:00:13.687 --> 00:00:17.379
So what we're going to do instead
is we're gonna switch to VSCode.

7
00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:20.843
Inside of the website for
the course, you will find a link to

8
00:00:20.843 --> 00:00:25.557
the GitHub repo where you can download the
files that we're about to work with and

9
00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:27.589
I'm gonna work on them in VSCode.

10
00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.490
You are welcome to use any editor
that you want, but by using VSCode,

11
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.807
we'll have access to more ways of
including styles inside of our document.

12
00:00:35.807 --> 00:00:41.689
Now that you have a sense of how
the cascade works, let's do a demo and

13
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.964
see how we can get it to
work here inside of VSCode.

14
00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:50.907
So if you open up the two files that we'll
be working with, which are index.html and

15
00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:55.499
take a look at style.css, there's a couple
of other files that are in there,

16
00:00:55.499 --> 00:00:57.610
you can ignore those for right now.

17
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.826
We're just gonna look at index.html and
style.css.

18
00:01:00.826 --> 00:01:04.403
You can see that these
are linked together and

19
00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:08.181
I am going to just scroll
to the bottom of my CSS.

20
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:12.499
And I'm going to start here,
in this particular demo.

21
00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:16.251
Let's say that I have a paragraph, and

22
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:20.914
I want to put a border
around these paragraphs and

23
00:01:20.914 --> 00:01:24.113
we'll say it's 2px solid red.

24
00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:29.278
Save my style sheet, and if I take a look
at this inside of my browser window,

25
00:01:29.278 --> 00:01:34.043
shockingly, I will wind up with
borders around all of my paragraphs,

26
00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:35.439
nothing new there.

27
00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.761
Let us take a look at other
ways though that we can

28
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:44.530
include this same type of
styling inside of our CSS.

29
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.708
Remember, border of course,
is a property that does not inherit,

30
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.301
that's why we're gonna work with that
here, in this particular example.

31
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:54.029
So this is the external style sheet.

32
00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:58.236
And if you take a look at the head
of this document right now,

33
00:01:58.236 --> 00:02:02.191
we have our style sheet is
linked here on line number 8,

34
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:05.492
that's our link to our
external style sheet.

35
00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:10.990
After that, we have an embedded style or
also called an internal style.

36
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.676
What goes in between the style tax?

37
00:02:13.676 --> 00:02:18.404
So if I were to go here and say paragraph,

38
00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:25.081
border 2px dotted blue,
what color would the borders be

39
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:30.940
around my paragraph at this
point in time and why?

40
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.805
Blue blue blue,
everybody thinks blue, okay.

41
00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:37.316
And if we refresh the page,

42
00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:41.673
sure enough you're all right dotted
blue borders around all the paragraphs.

43
00:02:41.673 --> 00:02:45.512
Why?
They have exactly the same specificity,

44
00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:49.733
right, we have just
the type selector here and

45
00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:55.700
it happens to be that my embedded
style comes after my link style.

46
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.850
What would happen if I took this
line 8 with my link style and

47
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.456
I move it after this embedded style here?

48
00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:06.439
What color are my borders now?

49
00:03:08.812 --> 00:03:10.350
Red or blue?

50
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.271
&gt;&gt; Dotted blue?

51
00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:12.311
&gt;&gt; Dotted blue?

52
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:14.624
Okay, dotted blue.

53
00:03:14.624 --> 00:03:15.720
&gt;&gt; One person said red.

54
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.514
&gt;&gt; One person said red,
one person said dotted blue.

55
00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:22.277
They are going to be red, okay?

56
00:03:22.277 --> 00:03:26.525
And this is because my
linked style comes later in

57
00:03:26.525 --> 00:03:29.850
the document than my embedded style.

58
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.748
I believe it was an older
rule a long time ago,

59
00:03:32.748 --> 00:03:37.266
where the embedded styles always
took priority over the link styles.

60
00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:42.738
But the way it works now is that whatever
comes later is the one that wins,

61
00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:45.443
where the specificity is the same.

62
00:03:45.443 --> 00:03:49.246
Of course, we can always amp up
the specificity along the way.

63
00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:54.225
So now that my link style is
coming after my embedded style,

64
00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:57.525
do I have a paragraph with a class on it?

65
00:03:57.525 --> 00:03:58.429
I don't.

66
00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:02.190
So let's just say I wanna
take this first paragraph and

67
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.250
put a different border on it.

68
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.417
We can do that here,
inside of my linked style sheet.

69
00:04:08.417 --> 00:04:15.348
We could put this even earlier,
let's say, it's p:first-of-type.

70
00:04:15.348 --> 00:04:20.980
And let's say it has
a border of 4px dashed,

71
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.568
double, one of my favorite border types,
double black.

72
00:04:27.568 --> 00:04:32.734
In fact, we'll make it a little bit
bigger so you can appreciate the beauty.

73
00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:38.739
So the first paragraph, the first-of-type
will have a 10px double border,

74
00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:43.773
whereas all the rest of the paragraphs
may have either a red border or

75
00:04:43.773 --> 00:04:47.946
a blue border depending on
what the order happens to be.

76
00:04:47.946 --> 00:04:51.603
So if we save this,
how is our first paragraph going to look?

77
00:04:57.813 --> 00:05:04.550
If we refresh the page, we have something
interesting going on here, and why?

78
00:05:06.536 --> 00:05:11.131
They actually have two paragraphs,
looks like the first and

79
00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:15.831
the last paragraph wind up with
the double black border on it.

80
00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:21.563
And that may be a little bit confusing,
until you take a look at your HTML.

81
00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:24.106
In the footer, we have a paragraph and

82
00:05:24.106 --> 00:05:27.695
it is also the first-of-type
inside of the footer.

83
00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:31.276
We haven't been specific and
said, article p:first-of-type,

84
00:05:31.276 --> 00:05:34.435
we just said all paragraphs that
are the first of their type.

85
00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:37.650
And so therefore, we've selected
the paragraph in the footer.

86
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:44.004
In addition to selecting the paragraph,
that's the first one in the article.

87
00:05:44.004 --> 00:05:47.126
It will override the red border and
so forth and

88
00:05:47.126 --> 00:05:50.659
that is because its specificity is higher,
right?

89
00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:56.831
First-of-type is a pseudo class,
paragraph is an HTML element.

90
00:05:56.831 --> 00:06:00.795
So our specificity for
this selector is 011,

91
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:05.056
whereas the paragraph has
a specificity of 001.

92
00:06:05.056 --> 00:06:10.572
And so even though it's coming earlier
in our external style sheet, the greater

93
00:06:10.572 --> 00:06:15.612
specificity is going to win out over
some of these styles that come later.

94
00:06:15.612 --> 00:06:18.991
And that is why the paragraph
border looks different here.

95
00:06:18.991 --> 00:06:24.934
Now, what if we start to get even crazier?

96
00:06:24.934 --> 00:06:31.672
So here in line in our paragraph,
I add to this, a style,

97
00:06:35.286 --> 00:06:40.153
Border, in fact, let's

98
00:06:40.153 --> 00:06:45.243
just do the border-bottom

99
00:06:45.243 --> 00:06:49.677
of 3px dashed orange.

100
00:06:49.677 --> 00:06:54.159
So now, I have an inline style here for
my first paragraph,

101
00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:58.028
how is that paragraph's
border going to look now?

102
00:07:01.134 --> 00:07:02.389
Think about that for a moment.

103
00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:14.232
When we refresh the page, you'll see
that we have a dotted orange border

104
00:07:14.232 --> 00:07:19.722
on the bottom, whereas the rest of
the border is that black double border.

105
00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:20.604
Why is that?

106
00:07:20.604 --> 00:07:25.695
Well, remember the border, the property
border by itself is shorthand.

107
00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:31.459
It includes all four sides of the box,
whatever box you're working with.

108
00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:36.076
As you spell out in your values,
it includes the size and

109
00:07:36.076 --> 00:07:40.309
the color and
the style of that particular border.

110
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:45.303
So we have overwritten just the bottom
border with what we put in line.

111
00:07:45.303 --> 00:07:50.607
Because in line, it's going to be anything
that comes elsewhere in the document

112
00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:56.075
even if the specificity, we're just got
it right there in the paragraph is lower.

113
00:07:56.075 --> 00:08:00.468
But the left, right, and top portions
of that border are still gonna

114
00:08:00.468 --> 00:08:03.819
take their styling from
that p:first-of-type.

115
00:08:03.819 --> 00:08:07.333
And of course,
this only affects the first paragraph,

116
00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:09.887
because that's where we put it in line.

117
00:08:09.887 --> 00:08:13.707
And so now, we have that dashed
border there underneath.

118
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.799
Okay, and then of course,

119
00:08:17.799 --> 00:08:21.459
the last part of this is starting
to throw in your bang important.

120
00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:25.485
And my sense about bang important has
always been, people put these in,

121
00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:29.124
because they don't understand
what's going on in the cascade.

122
00:08:29.124 --> 00:08:32.168
They don't understand what's
going on with specificity,

123
00:08:32.168 --> 00:08:35.223
they don't understand what's
going on with inheritance.

124
00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:40.110
Someone told them somewhere along the way,
just throw in a bang important and

125
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:41.547
maybe that will help.

126
00:08:41.547 --> 00:08:44.773
And they've done it a couple of times and
it helps sometimes.

127
00:08:44.773 --> 00:08:48.774
And then it quote doesn't work
other times and they just get very,

128
00:08:48.774 --> 00:08:50.069
very confused by it.

129
00:08:50.069 --> 00:08:54.402
So my recommendation to you is as follows.

130
00:08:54.402 --> 00:08:57.840
I strongly recommend not using it,
just don't use it,

131
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.020
because then you wind up with styles
that are far more predictable.

132
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:05.590
We don't go to the mirror
universe of the important styles,

133
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.162
we're gonna stay right where
we are with the normal styles.

134
00:09:09.162 --> 00:09:13.662
And you usually have enough depth
that you don't need bang important to

135
00:09:13.662 --> 00:09:14.865
override things.

136
00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:19.489
I think in my career, I've only had to
use bang important a handful of times.

137
00:09:19.489 --> 00:09:24.285
It was inevitably in a situation where I
was working with really crappy code that

138
00:09:24.285 --> 00:09:27.803
came from a WordPress developer
somewhere along the way.

139
00:09:27.803 --> 00:09:31.424
And they've already put bang
important somewhere and so

140
00:09:31.424 --> 00:09:35.355
this was the only way that I could
override what they had done.

141
00:09:35.355 --> 00:09:39.718
So let's take a look at how
this might wind up working out.

142
00:09:39.718 --> 00:09:43.518
So we're now in this
style up here at the top,

143
00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:49.719
we have an inline style that says
the border bottom is 3px dashed orange.

144
00:09:49.719 --> 00:09:53.689
What I'm gonna do now is
after my p:first-of-type,

145
00:09:53.689 --> 00:09:56.059
I'm gonna add a bang important.

146
00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:05.226
Okay, so now that p:first-of-type is

147
00:10:05.226 --> 00:10:10.066
going to have a four sided
black double border,

148
00:10:10.066 --> 00:10:14.785
but in line,
we have an orange dashed border.

149
00:10:14.785 --> 00:10:19.681
What is the border going to look like
around that first paragraph that's

150
00:10:19.681 --> 00:10:20.971
there on the page?

151
00:10:20.971 --> 00:10:24.827
Is it going to have a black
double border on all four sides?

152
00:10:24.827 --> 00:10:28.765
Or is it gonna have a black
double border on three sides and

153
00:10:28.765 --> 00:10:31.483
an orange dashed border on the fourth?

154
00:10:31.483 --> 00:10:34.737
And then we can take a look and
see what happens.

155
00:10:34.737 --> 00:10:39.133
And when we refresh,
you'll see that that bang important in

156
00:10:39.133 --> 00:10:44.232
the external style sheet is overriding
the inline style that we have.

157
00:10:44.232 --> 00:10:47.384
So this is one of the useful
things that you can do,

158
00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:50.763
if you are working in
an environment like WordPress,

159
00:10:50.763 --> 00:10:54.834
Squarespace, Wix,
some of these other various site editors.

160
00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:59.698
Where you may have that big box that
just says Custom CSS here, but you don't

161
00:10:59.698 --> 00:11:04.656
have access to the HTML, you have to have
access to HTML to do an inline style.

162
00:11:04.656 --> 00:11:10.116
But when you have an external style sheet,
and you're trying to override an inline

163
00:11:10.116 --> 00:11:15.266
style, bang important is the way that
you're gonna wind up having to do that.

164
00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:17.810
So that would be the use case for that.

165
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:21.256
If you are custom coding
your applications,

166
00:11:21.256 --> 00:11:24.711
you have access to all of the HTML and
the CSS.

167
00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:30.937
Honestly, there truly is no reason
to be using bang important, okay?

168
00:11:30.937 --> 00:11:34.846
It winds up being a useful thing only if
you're working with other people's code

169
00:11:34.846 --> 00:11:36.696
and you don't have full access to it.

170
00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.675
That is my opinion for
how bang important should be used.
