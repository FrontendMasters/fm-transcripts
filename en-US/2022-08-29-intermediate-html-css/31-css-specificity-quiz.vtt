00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.893
Now we're gonna have a quiz.

2
00:00:01.893 --> 00:00:04.273
I know that you're very
excited about this, but

3
00:00:04.273 --> 00:00:06.778
you can do this at your own pace and
at your own time.

4
00:00:06.778 --> 00:00:11.692
Once again, Estelle Weil has put
together a fantastic little quiz

5
00:00:11.692 --> 00:00:15.477
that has to do with
the speciFISHity of selectors.

6
00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:18.329
And she, of course is the one
who wrote about specificity,

7
00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:21.366
the cheat sheet with the plankton,
the fish, and the sharks.

8
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.899
So here are a whole series of selectors.

9
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:27.776
You can do this on your own and
it will grade it for you.

10
00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:32.918
So for example,
if I say this one here with the class

11
00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:38.790
of important is 001,
which is incorrect, by the way.

12
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.313
I can check my answers, and
she'll say, well, you got the 0 right,

13
00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:46.629
[LAUGH] but
you didn't get the other numbers right.

14
00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.800
So I can switch that around
to what it should be.

15
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.230
And check my answers again.

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.250
And it will go ahead and
do that check for you.

17
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.102
So, what I would encourage you
to do is to take some time

18
00:01:02.102 --> 00:01:04.639
to go through her quiz here.

19
00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.663
They get progressive more difficult
as you get down the bottom.

20
00:01:07.663 --> 00:01:11.383
And see how you can generate
this three digit numbers.

21
00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:16.261
The greater the specificity of these
numbers, the more likely they are to

22
00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:21.531
apply in the absence of inheritance in
the cascade, which are the extra special

23
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:26.827
source that sometimes make things work
not the way quite what you would expect.

24
00:01:26.827 --> 00:01:30.585
So feel free to to get some
practice calculating these numbers,

25
00:01:30.585 --> 00:01:33.659
it's a really great exercise and
well worth doing.
