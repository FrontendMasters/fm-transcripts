00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.549
The next thing I'd like to talk about
are the various parts of the webpage.

2
00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.409
Now these are probably HTML elements that
you're really very familiar with but

3
00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.155
you may not necessarily know the right
context in which to use each of get these

4
00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:15.585
elements, and so, therefore,
you don't use them at all.

5
00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.848
So what I'd like to do now is to go
through to elements like article, and

6
00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:25.665
section, and, div and headings, and
proper order of headings, and all of that.

7
00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.455
Let's talk about that now and
then we'll apply that in some code points.

8
00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:34.469
All right, so the content sectioning
elements, if you take a look at MDN,

9
00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.482
it will show you these types of elements
that are here, and some of these may

10
00:00:39.482 --> 00:00:44.610
be used on a regular basis, some of
these you may need to be reminded of.

11
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.974
So, let me just point out so the very
first one there has to do with address,

12
00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:51.580
another one of my favorite elements.

13
00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.700
Address of course, you might think
a postal address on a website.

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.965
That may be part of it, but it's basically
any way that you might contact somebody,

15
00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:05.081
so it could include social media,
email, phone,

16
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:10.290
it may even include geographic
coordinates if that's what's relevant.

17
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.154
So that is the address element, it can
be associated with an article in which

18
00:01:15.154 --> 00:01:18.422
case it's the author's
contact information, or

19
00:01:18.422 --> 00:01:22.754
if it's associated in the footer
at the very bottom of the webpage,

20
00:01:22.754 --> 00:01:27.855
It is the website's contact information,
so you can think about that as well.

21
00:01:27.855 --> 00:01:32.550
I'm gonna talk more about article,
and section, and div momentarily,

22
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.530
more about main momentarily.

23
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.898
Header and footer you're probably
familiar with of course the head,

24
00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.944
the top of the document,
footer for the bottom.

25
00:01:41.944 --> 00:01:46.304
Remember that you can have those for
the full web page, you probably

26
00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:50.968
are already doing that, the header for
the full web page, the footer for

27
00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:56.197
the full web page, but you can also have
headers or footers for articles as well.

28
00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:59.769
Okay, so that's just a few
little bit of some of those.

29
00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:04.682
Remember that div doesn't mean anything
at all, div means nothing some people

30
00:02:04.682 --> 00:02:08.714
say well that means it's a division,
it is short for division but

31
00:02:08.714 --> 00:02:13.406
it doesn't mean anything,
it's not a sectioning element, it doesn't,

32
00:02:13.406 --> 00:02:18.762
it's not responsible for anything in terms
of communicating meaning on the webpage,

33
00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:21.670
its whole purpose is to hold classes and
IDs.

34
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.151
That's it or groups other
elements together on a page so

35
00:02:25.151 --> 00:02:29.160
we can do things like layouts and
other types of tricks.

36
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.098
Very useful for CSS styling and JavaScript
programming as you already know, and

37
00:02:34.098 --> 00:02:36.430
span would be the inline equivalent.

38
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.970
So div by default is
a block-level element.

39
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.990
Span is an inline element.

40
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.930
That is the difference between those two.

41
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.670
So div should be your
element of last resort.

42
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.482
In other words, as you think about web
pages and communicating meaning of

43
00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:57.061
on web pages, you should try to use
any other element until you get to,

44
00:02:57.061 --> 00:03:01.404
I just need to group these things
together to make my Flexbox work,

45
00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:03.289
that is the time to use a div.

46
00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:08.410
So let's talk about when you might use
article section or div specifically.

47
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.250
And I always asks people,
is it related, or is it syndicated?

48
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.000
If it's related content, then we're
gonna talk about it as a section.

49
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.512
That's a section of the webpage,
in other words,

50
00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:23.021
this information is kind of related,
it's kind of grouped together,

51
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:26.340
maybe it doesn't stand alone,
but it is indeed related.

52
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.120
An article is syndicated.

53
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.527
I can take that piece of information,
I can put it anywhere and

54
00:03:32.527 --> 00:03:35.710
you would get meaning out of it,
so it stands alone.

55
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.360
Things like blog posts would
be an example of that.

56
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.860
Recipes would be an example of that.

57
00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.450
Many kinds of news articles
would be an example of that.

58
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.047
You probably want those things
associated with their branding, but

59
00:03:49.047 --> 00:03:51.910
they could be understood
by themselves in isolation.

60
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.991
And then div is that last thing,
there's no story, nothing's related,

61
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:03.180
you just need a box to group elements that
would be the one of your last resort.

62
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.940
So that's it.

63
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.450
Think about related Syndicated.

64
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.770
Main, however,
is not the same as all of those elements.

65
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.330
So main has to do with a marker
on the page, as it says here,

66
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.771
the main content area consists of
content that's directly related to or

67
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:22.502
expands upon central topic of the
document, or the central functionality of

68
00:04:22.502 --> 00:04:27.159
the application, there's one per page,
you can't have multiple mains,

69
00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.840
only one per page, and
this would be the focus of your page.

70
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.063
So your application and

71
00:04:32.063 --> 00:04:35.660
your writing in javaScript would
be inside of the main area.

72
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.045
Maybe you have additional information that
goes around it, the header, the footer,

73
00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:43.708
maybe you have some advertising that
goes on a sidebar or something, but

74
00:04:43.708 --> 00:04:46.649
the main focus of the page is
what goes in the main element,

75
00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:49.940
more on main because it's a really
interesting kind of thing.

76
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.814
So whatever is inside
of that main element,

77
00:04:52.814 --> 00:04:55.930
should be unique to this
particular document.

78
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.910
In other words, it's not stuff we're
gonna repeat over and over again.

79
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.077
You're gonna have the same
navbar on every page,

80
00:05:01.077 --> 00:05:03.914
you're gonna have the same logo
on every page, same social media

81
00:05:03.914 --> 00:05:06.929
contact information, that is not
appropriate to the main element.

82
00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:12.472
Main is strictly informative, so it's not
a sectioning element, it is useful for

83
00:05:12.472 --> 00:05:17.680
screen readers and such to know that
this is the main focus of the page.

84
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.764
So you might have a main in
addition to articles or sections,

85
00:05:21.764 --> 00:05:25.330
that would be what you would be doing.

86
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.620
It's a landmark, is better to use main
than the role equals pain for javaScript,

87
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.080
you can add an ID attribute to it and then
it's the target of a skip navigation link.

88
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.393
So if you know that technique where in the
upper corner usually upper left corner of

89
00:05:41.393 --> 00:05:47.420
the page, you might hide a link that says
skip navigation or skip to main content.

90
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.891
You can have them skip right to
the main element that is the portion of

91
00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:54.770
the page makes total sense.

92
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.480
And then this last point is what
is really interesting to me.

93
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.768
So browser read mode functionality looks
for the presence of the main element,

94
00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:03.112
as well as the heading and

95
00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:07.180
content sectioning elements when
converting content into Reader View.

96
00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.620
So if you've made use of Firefox as Reader
View, which is available by default,

97
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.926
Chrome has it with a flag, it will strip
out just like if you're on a news site,

98
00:06:15.926 --> 00:06:20.563
for example, it would just show you the
news article, strips out all the branding,

99
00:06:20.563 --> 00:06:23.088
strips out all the advertising and
so forth.

100
00:06:23.088 --> 00:06:27.736
Sometimes it will get you around password
protection, some of those new sites where

101
00:06:27.736 --> 00:06:30.877
they show you you can only see
the first five sentences and

102
00:06:30.877 --> 00:06:32.960
then you're blocked out.

103
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.640
Sometimes that will get you past that so
you can read the whole article.

104
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.070
So that is another use for main.

105
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.588
Any questions on that?

106
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:46.789
Okay, so let's do some more code then.

107
00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.596
&gt;&gt; Was a question.

108
00:06:48.596 --> 00:06:49.430
&gt;&gt; Okay.

109
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.660
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you saw it?

110
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.433
&gt;&gt; I did not.

111
00:06:51.433 --> 00:06:55.186
&gt;&gt; Can we use the address tag for
street address too?

112
00:06:55.186 --> 00:06:57.229
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Or be strictly used for

113
00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.659
what context is like sites and links?

114
00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:04.360
&gt;&gt; Yes, you can use it for
your postal address as well.

115
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.671
For the address element,
that would be just fine,

116
00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:09.907
which is might be what you expect.

117
00:07:09.907 --> 00:07:13.998
&gt;&gt; Why is there even a div and
a span when HTML is not meant for styling,

118
00:07:13.998 --> 00:07:18.560
it's only meant for semantics but
these things have no meaning at all?

119
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:23.477
&gt;&gt; Right, because sometimes you need
to group your HTML elements together in

120
00:07:23.477 --> 00:07:25.670
order to complete your styling.

121
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.879
So in other words we're not trying to
communicate anything with div or span but

122
00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:33.702
for example, in that code pen that I
just showed you with the ice cream,

123
00:07:33.702 --> 00:07:37.270
I had a description list and
an image and I wanted them side by side,

124
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.901
the only way to do that is to have
a parent for both of those elements,

125
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:45.300
we've marked it up semantically,
it's definitely a description list.

126
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:49.510
It's definitely an image,
they will stack vertically by default.

127
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:54.215
I need a parent around those so that I can
assign that parent like display flex or

128
00:07:54.215 --> 00:07:55.356
display grid, and

129
00:07:55.356 --> 00:08:00.710
then the additional properties that I need
to put those two things side by side.

130
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.413
So div in that case is not styling
anything for me, it's simply gonna

131
00:08:05.413 --> 00:08:10.378
hold a class where I can assign those
particular properties to that div.
