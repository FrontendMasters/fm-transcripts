WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.785
We've covered ordered lists, we've covered
unordered lists, we've covered a bunch of

2
00:00:04.785 --> 00:00:08.987
different kinds of selectors, the ones
who are familiar with grouping selectors,

3
00:00:08.987 --> 00:00:13.130
descendant selectors,
attribute selectors, all the ins child's.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.820
And that sort of brings
us up to a baseline here.

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.673
Those are tend to be the things that
people work with a lot inside of html and

6
00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.020
css going forward.

7
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.981
Now we get into some interesting wild and
crazy stuff that we can

8
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:33.050
also do with semantic html and
with different kinds of styling.

9
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.730
So the next thing we're going to
explore are our description lists.

10
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.970
You may also know these
as definition lists.

11
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.880
That's what they used to be called,
definition lists.

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.620
Now they're called description lists cuz
they're not just for definitions anymore.

13
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.260
So we're here and chapter two,
we're at part three.

14
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.700
And there's a link here
to this demo code pen.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.428
So if you wanna open that up,

16
00:00:55.428 --> 00:01:00.940
this is just gonna go through how we would
go about marking up a description list.

17
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.660
So I've got my html up over
here on the left hand side.

18
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.663
So the way you started to description list
is with the dl tag for description list,

19
00:01:11.663 --> 00:01:17.220
and of course you ended with slash dl,
as you probably could guess.

20
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.450
But since this is the list that is for
key value pairs,

21
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.690
there are two list items that
wind up here in the list.

22
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.870
So dt is for the term dd is for
the description.

23
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.181
So dt is the key, dd is the description,
and those terms and

24
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:41.190
descriptions can be organized as follows.

25
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.463
So over here in the display side you can
see we can have a one to one relationship,

26
00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:48.390
one dt, one dd.

27
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.778
We could have a one to many
relationship one dt, many dd.

28
00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:57.182
You can also have a many
to one relationship,

29
00:01:57.182 --> 00:02:03.550
many different dts with one dd or we can
have many to many, many dts to many dds.

30
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.430
All of those are all absolutely
legal in a description list.

31
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.551
So, here I have talked about various
types of fruits and vegetables and

32
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:19.855
we are just pairing them up here so
that we have all four of those

33
00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:25.587
types of key value pair possibilities
are all represented there.

34
00:02:25.587 --> 00:02:30.668
Now so that is just the raw styling for
that particular kind of list.

35
00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:34.798
One of the things that would make
this more useful is if we could group

36
00:02:34.798 --> 00:02:38.855
these elements, right, so
that we can do interesting layouts and

37
00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:41.690
we are limited in what we
can do in that regard.

38
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.338
One of the things that is
legal is to use the div

39
00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:49.915
element to group each
set of key value pairs.

40
00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:54.695
You can't just group put that div anywhere
you want in the description list.

41
00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:59.115
You have to put it around
the relevant key value pairs.

42
00:02:59.115 --> 00:03:03.620
So we have in this case of course
fruit and Apple those go together.

43
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.715
That's an additive,
vegetables which are broccoli spinach and

44
00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:10.960
squash that goes inside of a div and
so forth.

45
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.633
So those are all we can do
here in terms of our html and

46
00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:18.070
putting together this kind of list.

47
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.372
In terms of the kinds of content because
you're probably not making lists so

48
00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:23.500
what fruits and vegetables.

49
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.191
Anybody have any suggestions for
what kinds of content,

50
00:03:26.191 --> 00:03:28.330
might go together well
with a key value pair.

51
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.000
&gt;&gt; That some types of pets are.

52
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so a category and
members of that category, right?

53
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.776
So we can talk about dogs, we can talk
about breeds of dogs, breeds tats,

54
00:03:38.776 --> 00:03:40.960
we have breeds of cats, right?

55
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.600
What else?

56
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.852
How about frequently asked questions,
where we have a series of questions,

57
00:03:46.852 --> 00:03:51.110
right, and then answers that go with
those, that would be something like that.

58
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.003
So any type of those things where you
have a relationship between two items,

59
00:03:57.003 --> 00:04:00.665
and you wanna be sure that
relationship is represented,

60
00:04:00.665 --> 00:04:02.893
this is a great way to do it, okay.

61
00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:06.309
And we'll do more with description lists
as we go on because it's one of my

62
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:07.530
favorite things of html.

63
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.640
Any questions about a description list and
how its marked up?

64
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.599
&gt;&gt; Is it valid to use only a dt and
no dds corresponding to it?

65
00:04:20.657 --> 00:04:22.830
&gt;&gt; I am not sure of the answer to that.

66
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.730
I believe the answer to that is no that
you can't have just a dt with no dd.

67
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.285
But I'm not entirely sure on that I would
refer you to MDN to double check that.

68
00:04:32.285 --> 00:04:36.396
&gt;&gt; I was kind of curious about the nature
of it since we kind of have implied

69
00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:41.080
groups that are highlighted with these
divs that we have our dts and dds father.

70
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.074
If I thought about the example that that
question laid out, it just seems like

71
00:04:46.074 --> 00:04:49.570
well, then your dt would be associated
with ever dd is beneath it.

72
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.500
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Unless they suggested it was an empty

73
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.650
list, just one dt,
which would not be much of a list.

74
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.162
&gt;&gt; I think that's the second
one is what their question,

75
00:04:59.162 --> 00:05:01.020
that's what I was referring to.

76
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.790
Yeah, it's really targeted
at key value pair.

77
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.734
So one, one possible approach would
be to just put in a dd with no value

78
00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:12.940
that might be one possible answer.

79
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.275
Other questions?

80
00:05:14.275 --> 00:05:18.195
&gt;&gt; Only the dl is required and
then one element inside of it.

81
00:05:18.195 --> 00:05:19.890
&gt;&gt; Okay.

82
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.290
&gt;&gt; So dt or dd.

83
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.870
&gt;&gt; Well we can always
take a look at mdn dl.

84
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.540
So let's see what it does mdn tells us.

85
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.612
It doesn't necessarily say
here on this page either,

86
00:05:32.612 --> 00:05:37.020
I'm not gonna spend a huge amount
of time reading documentation.

87
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.580
So that is how a description list works.

88
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.290
Let's do a little bit of coding for that.

89
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.215
So if you wanna take a look at your
beginning code pen in part four,

90
00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:52.678
this is chapter two, part four we
have layouts with description lists,

91
00:05:52.678 --> 00:05:55.383
and this is where it gets super fun.

92
00:05:55.383 --> 00:05:58.680
So let's take a look at those layouts.

93
00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.782
By the way, questions that came up over
the break, and I am remiss in mentioning

94
00:06:03.782 --> 00:06:09.430
it if you're not accustomed to using code
pen, feel free to make a code pen account.

95
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.330
There's a button up here in the corner.

96
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.340
If you're logged in,
you'll see these settings.

97
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.571
If you're not logged in,
you can make an account, and

98
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:22.279
then down at the bottom of the page there
is a button to fork these ,so you can fork

99
00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:26.308
them to your account and save your
work if that is of interest to you.

100
00:06:26.308 --> 00:06:29.780
Obviously you can just code right here in
the screen if you're not wanting to save

101
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:30.300
your work.

102
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.463
All right, so
let's look at these description lists and

103
00:06:35.463 --> 00:06:39.450
let's talk about interesting
ways to name them out.

104
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.372
So what I'm starting with
here is I have a portion of

105
00:06:43.372 --> 00:06:46.211
that list that we just talked about.

106
00:06:46.211 --> 00:06:51.048
So right now I just have a series
of one to one relationships

107
00:06:51.048 --> 00:06:54.110
between the dt and the dd.

108
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.520
What might be one thing that I
could do to start to lay these out?

109
00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.240
Anybody have any ideas?

110
00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.250
&gt;&gt; Give a border to the dts.

111
00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.167
&gt;&gt; We could give them a border,
absolutely.

112
00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:11.927
Might we wanna put these things side
by side, maybe a column of information,

113
00:07:11.927 --> 00:07:14.284
that would be kind of a fun thing to do.

114
00:07:14.284 --> 00:07:19.345
All right, so
let's say that we're going to have a div,

115
00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:23.561
we're gonna put a div
around our fruit apple and

116
00:07:23.561 --> 00:07:28.642
we'll put another div around
our vegetables broccoli.

117
00:07:32.793 --> 00:07:38.430
Slash div and clean that up.

118
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:39.171
Okay, so

119
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:44.910
now what I have is I have divs that
are grouping together those dd and dt.

120
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:49.750
So anytime you see that, this case
this div is the parent the dt and

121
00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.603
the dd are the children.

122
00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:55.238
Now we have a relationship
between parents and children and

123
00:07:55.238 --> 00:08:00.070
we can start to think about things
like flexbox or grid, right.

124
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.373
So let's start applying some of those.

125
00:08:02.373 --> 00:08:06.666
So what I'm going to say we don't even
actually even need a class in this

126
00:08:06.666 --> 00:08:09.110
particular situation for these divs.

127
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:13.990
In real life you might have a class
on those divs for obvious reasons.

128
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.690
But just for fun,
let's just go with it here.

129
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:23.690
So we'll have our div,
will say display flex,

130
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:29.660
we could say flex flow row wrap, right.

131
00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:33.429
So now we've got them at
least on separate lines true.

132
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.550
If you can't see,
see if you can't style it.

133
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:42.561
So let's take a look at our
individual elements as well,

134
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:45.200
we have dt and we have dd.

135
00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:51.740
Now that dd as you saw previously,
it's indented slightly.

136
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.640
So there is a, I forget whether its
margin or padding that's put on it,

137
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.880
I think it's margin.

138
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.110
So if I said zero,
yeah it's a margin [LAUGH] so

139
00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:07.850
if we put a margin on that we can get
rid of that slight indent, right.

140
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:12.603
Maybe what I wanna do is set
a max width on this div.

141
00:09:15.193 --> 00:09:17.370
Let's say like 400 pixels.

142
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:24.140
And we can put a border on that
always one pixels solid red,

143
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.370
so we can see where the list is, okay.

144
00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:33.020
And now for our children for
our dds and our dts,

145
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.130
we could think about making
these the same whip.

146
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:40.728
So one way we could do that,
if you wanna talk

147
00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:45.680
about funky selectors we could
say div star just like this.

148
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:51.960
All of the children have div,
then we could say flex basis is 50%.

149
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.489
So now they're of equal width, right?

150
00:09:59.582 --> 00:10:02.580
I'm gonna give you a second
there to catch up.

151
00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:08.330
So in summary, we've got a max
width set on our list to only 400.

152
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.580
We don't have a huge amount of stuff.

153
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.310
We don't want it spilling
all over the page.

154
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.880
Clearly, you could apply
responsive design here.

155
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.460
We have a border going around each of our
divs so that we can see where they are.

156
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.646
We set that up to display as flexbox and
in a row, so

157
00:10:23.646 --> 00:10:28.550
now we have our dt and our dd,
they're next to each other.

158
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:34.265
Then I've said all of the children of
the divs which will be all the dts and

159
00:10:34.265 --> 00:10:39.140
all the dds, we've just doing it in
a very efficient sort of manner here, and

160
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.316
we've set that to be 50% wide.

161
00:10:44.733 --> 00:10:49.259
We do anything else that we
wanted here we could say for

162
00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:53.498
the dt, we could say font weight,
bold, right?

163
00:10:53.498 --> 00:10:55.940
That would be something we could do.

164
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.480
We could put a little
bit of padding on these.

165
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.160
Maybe we want to say padding on our divs.

166
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.100
Maybe we wanna do, I don't know,

167
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:12.576
one rim gives us a little
bit of space around those.

168
00:11:17.969 --> 00:11:20.829
And if you wanted this
to actually look pretty,

169
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:23.487
we could say something like border bottom.

170
00:11:23.487 --> 00:11:26.810
One pixel solid, maybe a nice dark grey.

171
00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:33.946
Whoop poof kind of nice looking, right?

172
00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:43.966
What if I did not want that border to show
up after the last item there on the list?

173
00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:45.220
Anyone have any ideas?

174
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:57.813
&gt;&gt; Do you have not last child?

175
00:11:57.813 --> 00:12:01.817
&gt;&gt; We're close [CROSSTALK]
there is the last child, right?

176
00:12:01.817 --> 00:12:04.229
&gt;&gt; So you can select that and
tell it no border?

177
00:12:04.229 --> 00:12:05.471
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

178
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:09.918
Yeah, so
we could say div colon last child.

179
00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:17.060
Border none, Hey that's awesome.

180
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.990
So now we don't have that spare
border hanging out in space, great.

181
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.340
All right, so well, that was easy.

182
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:31.980
That's just single values was single
pairs here, right one to one.

183
00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:35.360
Very, very easy,
we just did this with flexbox.

184
00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.660
What happens if we add a few more items?

185
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:44.319
So we had broccoli here
in our HTML on line 12,

186
00:12:44.319 --> 00:12:51.351
I'm gonna add some spinach And

187
00:12:51.351 --> 00:12:56.803
some squash.

188
00:13:00.783 --> 00:13:03.759
Okay, anybody tell me
what's going on here?

189
00:13:06.787 --> 00:13:11.131
&gt;&gt; Flexbox is filling up the things
cuz they have a width of 50%,

190
00:13:11.131 --> 00:13:13.150
whatever the width thing is.

191
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:15.019
And so it's jumping to the next row,

192
00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:18.480
because two of the 50s have
filled up 100% of the width.

193
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:23.033
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly, so flex box,
the children here for

194
00:13:23.033 --> 00:13:27.440
the dds and the dts, they're 50% wide.

195
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.680
So in that first row with vegetables
in broccoli, we have 50% and 50%,

196
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.866
that's a 100%.

197
00:13:32.866 --> 00:13:34.700
So that row is full.

198
00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.264
It takes our than our spinach and
our squash and those are 50% wide also and

199
00:13:39.264 --> 00:13:44.339
it winds up forming another row, so our
layouts kind of falling apart here, right.

200
00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:49.163
What would be one way that we
could fix this even though we're

201
00:13:49.163 --> 00:13:50.969
still using Flexbox?

202
00:13:50.969 --> 00:13:58.170
&gt;&gt; You can make dts take up 100% of
the width and then stay on their own line.

203
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.241
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so one thing you could do
would be to make the dts take up 100%

204
00:14:02.241 --> 00:14:06.420
of the width, and then the dds
they could do something different.

205
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:09.910
That is one possible solution,
but what is marketing gonna say?

206
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.176
Marketing's gonna say no,
it's gonna look exactly like this, right,

207
00:14:15.176 --> 00:14:17.210
marketing graphic design all those people.

208
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.081
Okay, so how are we gonna
fix this here with Flexbox?

209
00:14:24.707 --> 00:14:29.071
If we want all the dts to
always be on the left, and

210
00:14:29.071 --> 00:14:33.340
the dds are always gonna be on the right,
true.

211
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.052
Yeah, one thing we could
do then is instead of

212
00:14:38.052 --> 00:14:42.643
saying our margin is zero on the dt or
the dd.

213
00:14:42.643 --> 00:14:44.680
Let me write out four zeros here, right.

214
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:52.150
And just as a reminder, TRBL, right?

215
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.690
I always I don't know about the rest of
you, I always have to say this in my head.

216
00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.132
Remember to TRBL it keeps
you out of trouble,

217
00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:06.280
top right bottom left that's the order and
in for these numbers, right?

218
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:12.325
So what we want here is we actually want
no margin except on the right hand side.

219
00:15:12.325 --> 00:15:16.065
So that would be the second digit
here we gonna set that to auto.

220
00:15:16.065 --> 00:15:19.404
Okay, well anyway it breaks and this
is the whole point of the whole thing,

221
00:15:19.404 --> 00:15:22.805
it breaks, there's only so
far you can take this with flex box.

222
00:15:22.805 --> 00:15:27.652
So let's just redo this, and now what
we wanna do is if we think about this

223
00:15:27.652 --> 00:15:32.428
with grid instead this is actually
gonna be a better approach overall.
