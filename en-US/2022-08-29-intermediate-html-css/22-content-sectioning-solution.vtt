1
00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:03.755
So, welcome back, I hope you did well
with that exercise for the markup.

2
00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:06.318
We have a couple of
CodePens here from class.

3
00:00:06.318 --> 00:00:13.092
We'll start with Ben's CodePen here,
which I've got up in CodePen right here.

4
00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:18.095
And he has started with h1,
always a good place to start.

5
00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:22.308
There's the kaiju cafe we have the
navigation that follows right after that.

6
00:00:22.308 --> 00:00:26.109
So it's marked up with
an unordered list totally awesome,

7
00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.302
we might consider putting
a header around that but

8
00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:33.195
other than that looks awesome,
then we have about the cafe.

9
00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:37.541
We have the definition
here of Kaiju as an aside,

10
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:40.832
definitely a possibility for this.

11
00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:45.819
It's not really the focus of the webpage,
but it's kinda an interesting little

12
00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:50.585
thing you could eat at the Kaiju cafe
without knowing what a Kaiju was this, so

13
00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:51.626
there was that.

14
00:00:51.626 --> 00:00:56.946
We have some paragraphs of information,
we have our hours and

15
00:00:56.946 --> 00:01:03.207
our hours are description list and
we've got Sunday closed, perfect.

16
00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:04.416
We have our menu and

17
00:01:04.416 --> 00:01:09.340
here we've put the name of the food
product in this case because your burger.

18
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.139
With the price all inside of a DT,
definitely a great way to go on that.

19
00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:19.860
We've got the series of DDs after it that
are the descriptions of those menu items.

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.792
And it looks like you're missing a closing
description list there, no worries.

21
00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:30.424
And then down here at the bottom he's
Looked up how to mark up a quote

22
00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.502
really well using figure which is awesome.

23
00:01:33.502 --> 00:01:36.828
So we've got a figure,
we've got the blockquote inside of it and

24
00:01:36.828 --> 00:01:39.623
then we've got the caption for
the person who said it.

25
00:01:39.623 --> 00:01:44.717
And he's put site around
the link to that whole quote,

26
00:01:44.717 --> 00:01:49.933
which is almost correct almost so
fantastic well done.

27
00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:54.521
And then we've got our address here,
here's the name of the cafe we've got line

28
00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:58.744
breaks separating those particular items
&gt;&gt; The contact information and

29
00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:03.335
then down here at the bottom, we have
a little disclaimer and small type.

30
00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:08.794
So small used to be an element that was no
no we were not supposed to use it anymore

31
00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:13.789
because in the battle days in the 90s
small actually made small text.

32
00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:18.737
And that's why we had it, you have CSS for
that, but the new meaning of it's small

33
00:02:18.737 --> 00:02:22.784
and HTML-5 is that this is the fine print,
this is the legalese.

34
00:02:22.784 --> 00:02:24.335
This is the terms and conditions.

35
00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:26.766
This is, in this case, the disclaimer.

36
00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:30.124
So small is a great choice for
the bottom of the page here.

37
00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:34.833
So well done, Ben, great job.

38
00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:40.056
So Tyrone here also shared his code pen,
so thank you for that, Tyrone.

39
00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:44.004
And if we take a look at this,
he's got a header around his h1 and

40
00:02:44.004 --> 00:02:46.434
his navigation, which is fantastic.

41
00:02:46.434 --> 00:02:49.198
We have our article for the cafe.

42
00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:52.269
And he looked up how to use
the definition tag here.

43
00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.502
So Kaiju is the word that's
being defined that's why it's

44
00:02:56.502 --> 00:02:58.628
got the definition tag here.

45
00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:03.282
Since this isn't a paragraph, that
paragraph is the actual definition of that

46
00:03:03.282 --> 00:03:07.252
term or it's assumed that definition
is somewhere inside of that.

47
00:03:07.252 --> 00:03:11.795
So that is definitely
a good way to do that.

48
00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:14.598
So we've got our description list here.

49
00:03:14.598 --> 00:03:16.468
So you've got hours, and

50
00:03:16.468 --> 00:03:20.891
then you've got all of the individual
hours over on the side.

51
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:22.953
Maybe that might be one way of doing it.

52
00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:25.657
I like Ben's methodology better but again,

53
00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:28.582
it all depends on what
you're trying to convey.

54
00:03:28.582 --> 00:03:34.053
Then we have our menu and
he's done this with H4's and paragraphs.

55
00:03:34.053 --> 00:03:38.855
So that is certainly another way to mark
this up again depending on what it is

56
00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:43.297
that you wanna convey, that is
certainly a possible answer as well.

57
00:03:43.297 --> 00:03:45.570
I prefer the description list but

58
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.452
again that might be my own personal bias,
and he said he ran out of time.

59
00:03:50.452 --> 00:03:55.481
So, Tyrone, this looks fantastic
15 minutes first pass through,

60
00:03:55.481 --> 00:03:57.709
totally awesome, great job.

61
00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.301
So let me show you what my answer
looks like for this, all right, so

62
00:04:02.301 --> 00:04:05.172
the way I've marked mine up is like this.

63
00:04:05.172 --> 00:04:09.251
So once again, there's your
header with the h1 and the nav.

64
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:13.357
It put a name around the whole article, we
might have multiple articles on this page.

65
00:04:13.357 --> 00:04:18.095
In this case, we only have one, but
this is the main focus of the page, so

66
00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:19.115
there is that.

67
00:04:19.115 --> 00:04:24.876
I put figure around our definition,
so here we have our term.

68
00:04:24.876 --> 00:04:29.660
And if you give it that ID of kaiju
later when you reference that

69
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.714
particular word, and
I'll just scroll down here.

70
00:04:33.714 --> 00:04:37.315
These are all little things that I just
don't have time to go through with you

71
00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:40.028
individually but
I'm just demonstrating for you here.

72
00:04:40.028 --> 00:04:44.158
We could always link to it here when if
you're wondering what a Kaiju burger is.

73
00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:47.378
So, I don't know you're sitting in the
kaiju cafe you probably know what it means

74
00:04:47.378 --> 00:04:47.995
by that point.

75
00:04:47.995 --> 00:04:49.845
But hey,
maybe by the time you get down here,

76
00:04:49.845 --> 00:04:51.710
you're wondering what this kaiju thing is.

77
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.326
You could make a link that would go back
up to that definition, which is kind of

78
00:04:56.326 --> 00:05:00.032
a cool use of the definition
element in that particular case.

79
00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:04.285
So, that is the definition as
the focus of our figure and

80
00:05:04.285 --> 00:05:08.730
then here's our caption to
give us the citation for that.

81
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.440
And that is the link here and
the source, wordsense.

82
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.522
So this is just yet

83
00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:17.637
another way that you might go about
marking up something like this,

84
00:05:17.637 --> 00:05:22.777
cuz we're associating the definition with
who gave us the definition, all right.

85
00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:23.924
We've got a couple paragraphs.

86
00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:30.406
We've got a section I did my
hours as a description list and

87
00:05:30.406 --> 00:05:39.150
we've got, I did my menu as a description
list as well in a similar sort of way.

88
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.359
And then we have our block quote this is
that block quote figure caption thing

89
00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:45.408
that I had mentioned to you earlier.

90
00:05:45.408 --> 00:05:50.114
So here's our figure We have a block
quote that contains the thing that

91
00:05:50.114 --> 00:05:51.322
the person said.

92
00:05:51.322 --> 00:05:54.943
You can put the citation as
an attribute for the block quote,

93
00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:58.282
this all gets kinda hairy as
you do this kind of reading.

94
00:05:58.282 --> 00:06:01.032
The whole citation thing
is just mind blowing.

95
00:06:01.032 --> 00:06:04.068
That's why I haven't spent
a whole lot of time on it.

96
00:06:04.068 --> 00:06:06.461
Here is the text that goes with that.

97
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:11.007
We end the block quote, and
then the caption, we can say who said it.

98
00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:13.867
The person who said the thing does

99
00:06:13.867 --> 00:06:18.779
not get the citation according
to the MDN and to the W3C.

100
00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:24.180
So that is why there is no citation
down there in the figure caption.

101
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.996
Then we have the bottom of the webpage,
we have our contact address down here

102
00:06:28.996 --> 00:06:33.076
at the bottom, and we have our
disclaimer in small text, okay?

103
00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:35.638
So that was how I marked it up.

104
00:06:35.638 --> 00:06:38.084
And as I said,
there is no one right answer,

105
00:06:38.084 --> 00:06:40.810
it all depends on what
you're trying to convey.

106
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.393
And in some cases here,

107
00:06:42.393 --> 00:06:46.826
I am trying to show you some
additional ways you can mark things up,

108
00:06:46.826 --> 00:06:51.595
hoping that you will go to places like
MDN and look up why I did what I did.

109
00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:54.122
And read a little bit more about it.

110
00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.755
Could we have the price
as a DD tag potentially?

111
00:06:57.755 --> 00:07:00.220
When we get to the styling part of this,

112
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:05.100
I'm gonna show you how you could deal
with what I think you wanna do with that.

113
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.644
But really the description of that
menu item,is probably the DD element,

114
00:07:10.644 --> 00:07:14.606
the DT is probably the name and
the price of the product
