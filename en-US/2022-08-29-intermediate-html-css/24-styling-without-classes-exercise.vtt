00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.487
Okay, well,
I wanna give you a chance to apply these,

2
00:00:04.487 --> 00:00:08.110
so we are at chapter three,
part number four.

3
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.844
And we are looking at styling
without classes and so

4
00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:18.237
once again, I have given you
your starting mark up here for

5
00:00:18.237 --> 00:00:23.080
the Kaiju Cafe based on what I did for
my markup.

6
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.850
You can use this one if you wish, or you
can use the one that you created earlier.

7
00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.853
And what I'd like for you to do now,

8
00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:36.177
your challenge is I want you to
style this page with no classes.

9
00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:41.215
Based on all of the selectors that you
know so far, style it with no classes so

10
00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:46.047
you can add divs, you can add spans but
you can't give them the classes.

11
00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:50.254
And you probably don't need to
change the markup otherwise other

12
00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:53.096
than maybe adding a couple of divs or
spans.

13
00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:57.524
And then I want you to style it up
as best you can, I've given you some

14
00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:02.365
suggestions here if you're looking for
our color palette or some fonts.

15
00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:07.259
I've picked the Creepster font from
Google Fonts which looks exactly as you

16
00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.939
would expect and if you wanna change
those you're more than welcome to.

17
00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.639
If you don't like my color palette
feel free to change that but

18
00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.919
see what you can do about styling this
page and never make use of a class.
