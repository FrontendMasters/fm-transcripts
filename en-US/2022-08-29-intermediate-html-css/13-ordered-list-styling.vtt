00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.002
The last thing I wanna do is let's just
take a quick look at ordered lists.

2
00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:08.024
So we talked about ordered lists earlier,
we talked about some attributes that can

3
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:11.540
be used to restyle the actual numbers
that are there on the ordered list.

4
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.470
You can do similar things here.

5
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:21.852
So, for example,
Down here into my ordered list,

6
00:00:21.852 --> 00:00:27.230
.ordered, we can say list-style-type.

7
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.480
So there are some values that go
specifically with the ordered lists.

8
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.280
Then we could say, upper-roman.

9
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.952
That'll give us roman numerals, right?

10
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.791
We could also do other
various things here if we

11
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:51.712
wanted to once again with nth child,
so we could say,

12
00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:56.725
ordered li:nth-child, let's say, 1.

13
00:00:56.725 --> 00:00:59.413
Here's a case for
actually using real numbers.

14
00:01:04.382 --> 00:01:09.359
List- style-type:.

15
00:01:12.646 --> 00:01:17.626
Once again, we can go to our our emoji and
we can choose the emoji guys here.

16
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.608
Right, so now my first child,

17
00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:27.453
I could also have said li:first-child,
that would work also.

18
00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:32.140
That will always put the emoji number
one next to my first thing on the list.

19
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.730
And then we could set up a whole series
of these so that we can have two, three,

20
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.412
four, five, and all of the other emoji
numbers that are there, makes sense?

21
00:01:41.412 --> 00:01:44.822
Okay, it's just some ideas for

22
00:01:44.822 --> 00:01:49.124
how you can switch up those list styles.

23
00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:52.129
By the way,
you can always also still do, and

24
00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:55.073
I'll just put it in here
as a separate item,

25
00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:04.072
Let's do unordered li:last-child.

26
00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:11.063
You could always do this,
list-style-type: none.

27
00:02:16.888 --> 00:02:17.814
There we go.

28
00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:22.700
So you could always make them disappear,
too, if you don't want them, right?

29
00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.625
list-style-type of none
makes them all go away.

30
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:30.190
They will still be indented because
your list has either margin or

31
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.590
padding, which it inherits from
the browser's style sheet.

32
00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.380
So if you want it to be all
the way over to the side here,

33
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.244
I would recommend you set your
padding to 0 and your margin to 0.

34
00:02:45.244 --> 00:02:50.491
And we probably have to put that,

35
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:55.400
On the unordered list itself in order for
it to work.

36
00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:02.261
That pushes those icons off the page,

37
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.300
because now we've gotten rid of
the margin and the padding, right?

38
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.741
Some browsers do it with padding,
some browsers do it with margin.

39
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.407
This is one of the reasons that you
would use a normalized style sheet or

40
00:03:12.407 --> 00:03:13.536
a reset style sheet.

41
00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:16.885
Because then all the browsers are using
whatever that styles heet calls for,

42
00:03:16.885 --> 00:03:18.390
whether it's margin or padding.
