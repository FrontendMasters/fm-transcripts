00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.390
Fantastic, we're on to part two,
your turn.

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.463
So now your time to practice,
I have given you, once again,

3
00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:17.840
the JavaScript window has got
some cheat sheet here for

4
00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.804
your content sectioning pleasure.

5
00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.039
Don't worry about the CSS,
all I want you to do is mark this up and

6
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.915
mark it up as semantically as possible,
don't worry about the styling.

7
00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:33.270
Don't worry about the interactivity,
and there are many right answers.

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.620
It all depends on what you're
trying to communicate.

9
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.710
Yes, Mark?

10
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.783
&gt;&gt; I know you only have
one h1 inside a page?

11
00:00:42.783 --> 00:00:44.590
&gt;&gt; It depends on who you talk to.

12
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.740
The SEO people will tell you,
you can only have one h1 per page.

13
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.549
Generally speaking,
the h1 is the site identity.

14
00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.659
If you talk to Google they'll tell you
that sure you can have more than one h1,

15
00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.273
you might have one h1 for the site
identity, you might have an h1 for

16
00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:00.607
an article for example.

17
00:01:00.607 --> 00:01:03.792
And in some cases you may even have an h1
in a section depending on what you're

18
00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:04.825
trying to communicate.

19
00:01:04.825 --> 00:01:08.823
I think, the industry is
coalescing around one h1 per page.

20
00:01:08.823 --> 00:01:12.512
But technically speaking,
either will validate, and

21
00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:14.952
Google is fine with either of those.

22
00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:19.799
So you're gonna work on
the Kaiju cafe here, and

23
00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.187
you just gotta do exactly
just as I just did.

24
00:01:24.187 --> 00:01:28.084
I've had a few hints in here,
I talked about the definition element,

25
00:01:28.084 --> 00:01:32.261
it might be one that you wanna look up,
it might be one you could make use of.

26
00:01:32.261 --> 00:01:37.482
You can read through here,
we've got ours, we've got a menu, and

27
00:01:37.482 --> 00:01:44.094
we've got a quote, we have an address, we
have a disclaimer down here at the bottom.

28
00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:46.870
So let's give you a 15 minutes or

29
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.771
so to get through some of this anyway and
try marking this up.

30
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:56.050
And I'll go through with you with what
my answer is at that point in time
