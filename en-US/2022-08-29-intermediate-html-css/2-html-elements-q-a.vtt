1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.552
How does one remember
all of these elements?

2
00:00:02.552 --> 00:00:04.975
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
how does one remember all these elements?

3
00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:06.279
It's a great question.

4
00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.805
And of course,
practice is the best way to use it.

5
00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.471
Just like when you learn a new vocabulary
word in English, or your native language,

6
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:16.953
then you have to start using it in
a sentence and using it more and

7
00:00:16.953 --> 00:00:18.617
more in order to remember it.

8
00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:23.278
So it's the ones that we tend to
remember that are the ones that we use.

9
00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:27.631
So that is why I encourage you to do
something like in your weekly staff

10
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:31.472
meeting, or your weekly standup,
rotate around the room.

11
00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:36.298
Have somebody different every
time present a new element.

12
00:00:36.298 --> 00:00:40.956
And it can be literally a two-minute
presentation, this is the element, this is

13
00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:45.627
what it does, here's how, some sample
content where we might use this element.

14
00:00:45.627 --> 00:00:48.241
And maybe periodically, maybe every month,

15
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.870
you could start reviewing those
particular types of elements.

16
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.871
You could make a little code pen.

17
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:56.319
You could write yourself references for

18
00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.490
quick lookup inside of
your development team.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.570
So really, it's just a matter of
making a little bit of effort.

20
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.137
Once you get into the habit of thinking
about what is the right element

21
00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:12.941
to markup this content, you'll find
that it starts to come naturally,

22
00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:16.426
just like anything else
that you do in programming.

23
00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:17.732
Yeah, Mark?

24
00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:21.822
&gt;&gt; Will you talk about the meta elements
that we include in our webpage,

25
00:01:21.822 --> 00:01:25.360
specifically the use of the Open Graph,
OG meta elements?

26
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.236
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I wasn't gonna talk
about the meta elements today,

27
00:01:29.236 --> 00:01:32.579
mostly because I have
an enormous amount to cover.

28
00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.562
But if you take a look at Facebook as
a page for this, it's ogp.me, I believe.

29
00:01:39.562 --> 00:01:40.971
It's opengraphprotocol.me is the website.

30
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:45.167
And it has a reference for
all of those meta elements,

31
00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:49.923
and how you would use the various
kinds of Open Graph protocol

32
00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:54.136
markup with the meta elements for
that kind of thing.

33
00:01:54.136 --> 00:01:55.826
So have a look there.

34
00:01:55.826 --> 00:01:58.988
&gt;&gt; Why were semantic tags introduced, and

35
00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:03.551
how do browsers decipher
the semantic meaning of any tag?

36
00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:08.557
&gt;&gt; Okay, so if we go back to 1990,
right, the whole purpose of

37
00:02:08.557 --> 00:02:14.242
the Internet at that point in time,
we had the Iron Curtain up in Europe.

38
00:02:14.242 --> 00:02:19.561
We had a CERN, the Institute for
Physics there in Switzerland,

39
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:26.074
wanted to share their scientific papers
with Soviet scientists and so forth.

40
00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:29.454
This is a cause near and dear to my heart.

41
00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:32.239
I worked in a science lab in 1992, and

42
00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.741
I wound up pulling paper
copies of research papers,

43
00:02:35.741 --> 00:02:41.007
putting them in envelopes and mailing
them to researchers all over the world.

44
00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:44.241
That's how we did it before the Internet.

45
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:48.855
And so one of the big problems that
the web was designed to solve was to allow

46
00:02:48.855 --> 00:02:51.396
scientists to share their work online.

47
00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:54.357
And as a result, they needed a way.

48
00:02:54.357 --> 00:02:57.217
Long before things like
CSS were conceived of,

49
00:02:57.217 --> 00:03:00.232
we needed a way to make
a scientific paper online.

50
00:03:00.232 --> 00:03:02.691
So what are the kinds of things
that we would need to do that?

51
00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:05.643
We need some headings, make things big.

52
00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:06.499
This is the title, right?

53
00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.800
We need some paragraphs.

54
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.882
We need some tables to share data.

55
00:03:09.882 --> 00:03:14.098
We need a way to put in Images into
the page to share our various graphs, and

56
00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:16.823
photos, and so
forth from a scientific paper.

57
00:03:16.823 --> 00:03:21.485
And so that was the original source
of those elements, when, basically,

58
00:03:21.485 --> 00:03:26.221
when HTML had the display associated
with it in the bad old days in the 90s.

59
00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:29.787
Later, we split off the whole look
of it once the web started to

60
00:03:29.787 --> 00:03:31.365
get more commercialized,

61
00:03:31.365 --> 00:03:35.836
and people were concerned about how it
looked, cuz it was really not pretty.

62
00:03:35.836 --> 00:03:40.250
And so then that's where we
went down the road for the CSS.

63
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.196
But semantic HTML continues to be
important, because the browser, for

64
00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:50.727
example, the user agent, will have some
styles associated with it by default.

65
00:03:50.727 --> 00:03:53.975
They may help you in styling the page.

66
00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:58.632
And you may also, by building in
those particular semantic elements,

67
00:03:58.632 --> 00:04:02.991
you will be able to do more with
accessibility right out of the box.

68
00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:06.059
There's so
much less you have to retro engineer.

69
00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:11.265
And of course, accessibility is
becoming increasingly important.

70
00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:14.427
&gt;&gt; How do you know which accessibility
properties to use in your HTML?

71
00:04:14.427 --> 00:04:18.305
&gt;&gt; How do you know which accessibility
properties to use in your HTML?

72
00:04:18.305 --> 00:04:21.017
It depends on what
you're trying to convey.

73
00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:24.422
It depends on what your
screen readers are doing, and

74
00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:29.125
it depends what your accessibility
professionals are going to tell you.

75
00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:33.316
If you start with semantic markup,
you're gonna get a lot of the way there.

76
00:04:33.316 --> 00:04:37.149
And then on top of that,
you can add whatever additional roles, and

77
00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:42.320
ARIA elements, and anything else that's
required for accessibility purposes.

78
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.820
So Frontend Masters has
a course on accessibility.

79
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.767
I would encourage you to check it out.

80
00:04:46.767 --> 00:04:50.845
Jon Kuperman's accessibility version
two right here at Frontend Masters,

81
00:04:50.845 --> 00:04:52.672
it's part of your subscription.

82
00:04:52.672 --> 00:04:55.508
So take a look at that, and that will
drill into that into much more detail.

83
00:04:55.508 --> 00:04:57.930
I am not an accessibility professional,
and

84
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.936
so I know broadly speaking
what needs to be done on that.

85
00:05:00.936 --> 00:05:05.960
But I'm not an expert in that area, I'm
not an expert in how screen readers work.

86
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.242
&gt;&gt; Will learning how to use
these HTML elements, and

87
00:05:11.242 --> 00:05:17.671
possibly making things more
dynamic reduce my JavaScript?

88
00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:19.612
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Amount of JavaScript?

89
00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:23.306
&gt;&gt; Yeah, how can this help reduce
your amount of JavaScript?

90
00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:28.670
Let's just leave that as it will,
and that is what today is all about.

91
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.893
So you're gonna see how we can really
start to reduce amounts of code with good

92
00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:32.991
markup and with good CSS.
