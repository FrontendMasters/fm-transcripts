00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.656
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So that's just
a super basic example of GraphQL.

2
00:00:03.656 --> 00:00:06.351
I'm sure you guys have a lot of
questions about what's going on,

3
00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:09.928
and that's the whole point of this course,
is we're gonna dive through all the things

4
00:00:09.928 --> 00:00:13.309
that I just did plus more in more detail
to figure out what's actually happening.

5
00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.909
But in the meantime, what I want you to do
is take what I did and add some more types

6
00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.632
to your cat or whatever you did,
or maybe even add another type.

7
00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:26.355
And see if you can make some more queries,
or maybe add some more fields to this cat,

8
00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:30.356
and don't forget to update your
resolvers to take advantage of that.

9
00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:35.928
For instance, if I was gonna add
another field on cat called age,

10
00:00:35.928 --> 00:00:41.721
and it's a number or integer,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And

11
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:44.868
if I save this, let the server rebuild,

12
00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:49.876
just to show you what will happen
if I don't update my resolver.

13
00:00:49.876 --> 00:00:53.798
And I come back here, I'll refresh this so
I get some nice autocomplete, and now,

14
00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:55.379
you can see that I can type an age.

15
00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.352
But because I didn't update my
resolver to send back an age,

16
00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:01.637
actually this will be fine,
cuz I didn't put a requirement on it.

17
00:01:01.637 --> 00:01:03.796
Yeah, let me put a requirement on it.

18
00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:12.842
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so now if I go
back and I try to execute this I'll get

19
00:01:12.842 --> 00:01:16.666
an error, because I didn't update my
resolver to send back an age, and

20
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:18.424
age is supposed to be required.

21
00:01:18.424 --> 00:01:21.559
So as you can see,
it starts to get very complicated.

22
00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:22.871
But just play around with it.

23
00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:24.214
I didn't tell you about any of the types,
so

24
00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:25.495
you can just use strings for everything.

25
00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:27.585
You saw that I used something called int,
you can try that.

26
00:01:27.585 --> 00:01:29.929
But just see if you can add some fields,

27
00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:32.710
add some more stuff to
the resolver down here,
