&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And I have a schema cheat
sheet here that you can look at that's

2
00:00:04.865 --> 00:00:10.090
got a lot more stuff when it comes
to GraphQL Schema and stuff.

3
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:11.730
So it's a really good cheat sheet.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.594
Shows you pretty much every single thing
you need when it comes to creating

5
00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:20.522
a GraphQL using the SDL,
the schema definition language.

6
00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:23.450
I talked about those scholars and
other stuff.

7
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.220
There's lots that we didn't talk
about that we'll be getting to.

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.645
But it's a really good reference to
understanding how to create schemas and

9
00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.321
the different parts inside
the schemas that exist in GraphQL.

10
00:00:34.321 --> 00:00:36.503
That link is in the slides.

11
00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:40.210
Really good, I highly recommend having
this pulled up as you start going through

12
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.620
this next exercise cuz it
will definitely help you.
