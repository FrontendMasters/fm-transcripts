1
00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:01.953
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So,
these are all things that could matter.

2
00:00:01.953 --> 00:00:03.930
Here we go people, let's get building.

3
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.014
We've got to explore the nature
of the data, know your data and

4
00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:09.259
how to convert it.

5
00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.518
One, select sample of
historic refund requests.

6
00:00:12.518 --> 00:00:16.156
Each has data on, there's a whole database
of it, background of the request.

7
00:00:16.156 --> 00:00:19.048
Account history,
request size, IP patterns,

8
00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:21.520
we saw a list of things that might matter.

9
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.940
And then it has a corollary data set.

10
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.400
It has,what would be the word,
like a associated data set.

11
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.506
It has a parallel data
set of the decision to

12
00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:36.965
whether the request was refunded,
yes or no.

13
00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:37.704
Got it?

14
00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:40.751
Okay, pick the background
info that matters.

15
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:41.781
There's a bunch of it.

16
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.097
Let's pick some that we
think really matters.

17
00:00:44.097 --> 00:00:46.922
We'll go into in deploying this model.

18
00:00:46.922 --> 00:00:50.604
Shouldn't say the name of it yet,
but deploying this in time,

19
00:00:50.604 --> 00:00:54.158
we'll decide exactly which,
what do we call these things?

20
00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:56.404
Anyone know what these inputs are called?

21
00:00:56.404 --> 00:00:59.110
Anyone know they're called features?

22
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.629
So we'll decide which of these features
we want to actually use in making

23
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.239
our prediction, in making our converter,
sorry, making our converter

24
00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:15.416
that will be used for making our decision,
making our prediction.

25
00:01:15.416 --> 00:01:17.935
Okay, so let's get to it, people.

26
00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:22.420
I'm going to, on this side,
it wouldn't be a session of hard parts.

27
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.382
If we were not to have a good
delineation on our board.

28
00:01:28.382 --> 00:01:35.894
This side here, people, we are going
to go about creating our converter.

29
00:01:35.894 --> 00:01:39.472
All right, up here we're gonna
go about creating our converter.

30
00:01:39.472 --> 00:01:45.112
Here it is, create converter.

31
00:01:45.112 --> 00:01:48.827
Excellent, and
let's start with good old Ben.

32
00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:52.085
Ben is a very noble customer.

33
00:01:52.085 --> 00:01:53.541
Actually, we've got to pick our features,
haven't we?

34
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:55.567
So let's pick our features.

35
00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:58.261
I don't know,
amount feels pretty important, right?

36
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.830
Shout out to Maria for that one.

37
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.363
I think account length feels pretty
important and what a surprise

38
00:02:07.363 --> 00:02:13.209
the other one I suggested would get
chosen accounts on IP there we go.

39
00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.976
So Ben's a very good customer Ben
how long have you had do you think

40
00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:20.670
your door dash or Uber Eats account?

41
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.363
&gt;&gt; Ben: Four years.

42
00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:23.461
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Four years,
sounds good to me.

43
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:28.221
And your refund request was?

44
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:29.127
&gt;&gt; Ben: What?
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: What do you think?

45
00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:32.226
You're like, don't get it wrong, yeah, no.

46
00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.475
&gt;&gt; Ben: They didn't
send me my Indian food,

47
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:35.846
I don't know what-
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So

48
00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:39.400
maybe you had a big meal,
it's like a, I don't know, $80.

49
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.464
How about that?

50
00:02:40.464 --> 00:02:42.164
That's not that big,
I guess, on DoorDash, right?

51
00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:46.725
And how many accounts on your IP address
you've got, you and your partner maybe, or

52
00:02:46.725 --> 00:02:47.378
whatever.

53
00:02:47.378 --> 00:02:49.953
So two, okay, good.

54
00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:55.639
The refund we know by the customer
service rep was given one, excellent.

55
00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:56.761
People gonna drag this out.

56
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:59.614
Next up, Joe.

57
00:02:59.614 --> 00:03:04.163
Joe, Joe, bad actor.

58
00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:09.121
How long have you had your
DoorDash account, Joe?

59
00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:09.747
&gt;&gt; Joe: Six years.

60
00:03:09.747 --> 00:03:11.391
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No,
Joe, you're a bad actor.

61
00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.033
&gt;&gt; Ben: How long have you
had your DoorDash account?

62
00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.725
&gt;&gt; Joe: Six weeks.

63
00:03:16.725 --> 00:03:19.418
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: I get the feeling
it's more like six hours.

64
00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:23.588
So I think we're gonna go for 0.01 years.

65
00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:26.682
And how much are you trying to refund,
Joe?

66
00:03:26.682 --> 00:03:27.988
&gt;&gt; Joe: $25.

67
00:03:27.988 --> 00:03:31.399
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Joe, you are a really,
really bad criminal, [LAUGH].

68
00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:32.743
&gt;&gt; Joe: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Joe is trying

69
00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:34.025
to refund 500.

70
00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:35.761
I love how pure you are, Joe.

71
00:03:35.761 --> 00:03:39.361
Even though, you know you can't
even cosplay as criminal.

72
00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:43.667
And you've got not that many accounts
on the IP, but you're trying it,

73
00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.298
you've got seven, okay?

74
00:03:45.298 --> 00:03:50.195
And this led the customer service
rep to determine no refund, refund,

75
00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.815
minus one, because honestly, Joe.

76
00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:56.489
The examples you gave otherwise,
would be like a very unpleasant,

77
00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.689
customer service rep who didn't give
you a refund for your six year account.

78
00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.852
A $25 request like that was quite harsh.

79
00:04:03.852 --> 00:04:06.235
So, Joe, you're a bad actor.

80
00:04:06.235 --> 00:04:11.979
All right, let's have Kayla.

81
00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:15.027
Kayla's, just very reasonable.

82
00:04:15.027 --> 00:04:16.430
Kayla, maybe, what do you think?

83
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.856
How many years?

84
00:04:19.856 --> 00:04:20.376
&gt;&gt; Kayla: Five years.

85
00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:22.694
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Five years, sure.

86
00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:25.911
Maybe you're just refunding 45 bucks and
I don't know,

87
00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:28.563
you've got one account on your IP,
no problem.

88
00:04:28.563 --> 00:04:32.552
And so no problem,
Kayla got their refund back.

89
00:04:32.552 --> 00:04:38.117
Maria has, let's say, I think, a year and

90
00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:44.135
then Maria maybe was
trying to refund 200 and

91
00:04:44.135 --> 00:04:48.799
let's say two IP accounting IP, and

92
00:04:48.799 --> 00:04:52.117
they gave Maria a refund.

93
00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:53.432
Because why wouldn't they?

94
00:04:53.432 --> 00:04:54.636
Very reasonable.

95
00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:56.886
Maria seems fab.

96
00:04:56.886 --> 00:04:57.666
And so there we go.

97
00:04:57.666 --> 00:05:01.604
We have our sample with
the background features things,

98
00:05:01.604 --> 00:05:05.386
that we think matter,
features being the fancy word.

99
00:05:05.386 --> 00:05:09.604
Background info that we think matter,
select your features.

100
00:05:09.604 --> 00:05:16.238
Now, people, we have to, and
blue is going to be my creation process.

101
00:05:16.238 --> 00:05:20.914
We have to somehow develop.

102
00:05:20.914 --> 00:05:27.242
Some set of rules,
I'm gonna call it a converter,

103
00:05:27.242 --> 00:05:32.982
some set of rules that
successfully convert,

104
00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:37.556
really, 482 into the number 1.

105
00:05:37.556 --> 00:05:39.742
Different numbers, 0.01, right?

106
00:05:39.742 --> 00:05:45.049
Joe, 507 into what output?

107
00:05:45.049 --> 00:05:45.906
What's our target here?

108
00:05:45.906 --> 00:05:49.670
Joe, what do we wanna make
sure these kind of we make

109
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.239
sure our rules know to take these
numbers into getting a what?

110
00:05:54.239 --> 00:05:56.086
&gt;&gt; Joe: Neg.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Negative one exactly.

111
00:05:56.086 --> 00:05:59.187
Kayla, these numbers, 5, 45, 1,

112
00:05:59.187 --> 00:06:03.631
we want to be able to convert
them into what number, Kayla?

113
00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:05.387
&gt;&gt; Kayla: One.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: One, exactly.

114
00:06:05.387 --> 00:06:07.941
And Maria, your numbers into what number?

115
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:10.330
&gt;&gt; Maria: One.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: One, exactly.

116
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.520
So that's our target output.

117
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.299
The target output we want to achieve
with our converter is respectively 1,

118
00:06:21.299 --> 00:06:22.845
-1, 1, and 1.

119
00:06:22.845 --> 00:06:28.373
Because if we can work out the rules
to convert these numbers into 1,

120
00:06:28.373 --> 00:06:32.584
these into minus 1,
these into 1, these into 1.

121
00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:37.600
Then for Paul, whatever Paul's numbers
are, we can apply those rules to and

122
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.933
generate out a 1 or a- 1,
and make a prediction.

123
00:06:40.933 --> 00:06:45.865
For whether Paul should get a refund or
not based on the core assumption

124
00:06:45.865 --> 00:06:50.388
that this sample is representative
of the overall population.

125
00:06:50.388 --> 00:06:54.902
Okay, so what rules might we have?

126
00:06:54.902 --> 00:06:57.136
Let's turn to Nick.

127
00:06:57.136 --> 00:07:02.545
Nick, Ruff, actually, everybody make
it really hard for the editing.

128
00:07:02.545 --> 00:07:06.487
What do we think we want our let's say,

129
00:07:06.487 --> 00:07:12.223
years to be greater than if we
are to be greater than this,

130
00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:15.100
we will have an output of 1?

131
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.434
That is to say, we'll give a refund.

132
00:07:16.434 --> 00:07:21.389
What roughly Nick would you say might
be some a good boundary for our years?

133
00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:26.142
You gonna be too good, that's a problem.

134
00:07:26.142 --> 00:07:29.192
Okay, what might be a good boundary for
our years?

135
00:07:29.192 --> 00:07:33.231
Everyone shout out a number, cuz I need
one of them to be the one that we choose.

136
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:34.453
What
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1?

137
00:07:34.453 --> 00:07:35.356
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: What 1?

138
00:07:35.356 --> 00:07:38.627
Yes, years greater than
one feels very good.

139
00:07:38.627 --> 00:07:39.813
Watch out.

140
00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:41.809
[LAUGH] Good stuff, exactly.

141
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:43.693
Well done, Ben.

142
00:07:43.693 --> 00:07:45.378
I feel a bit bad for Maria, potentially.

143
00:07:45.378 --> 00:07:47.374
But what about dollars?

144
00:07:47.374 --> 00:07:52.992
Spend less than what, Kayla, do you think,
to be able to give a refund?

145
00:07:52.992 --> 00:07:54.667
Maybe $200?

146
00:07:54.667 --> 00:07:55.592
Why do I keep talking over?

147
00:07:55.592 --> 00:07:57.437
I'm so sorry, Kayla, less than what?

148
00:07:57.437 --> 00:07:58.460
&gt;&gt; Kayla: $200.

149
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.318
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: $200, nice one, Kayla.

150
00:08:00.318 --> 00:08:04.131
And then accounts on IP,

151
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:09.768
let's say, less than what people?

152
00:08:09.768 --> 00:08:11.446
We don't want Joe's to pass, do we?

153
00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:12.835
So what do we think, people?

154
00:08:12.835 --> 00:08:13.669
Less than what?

155
00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:14.270
&gt;&gt; Ben: 3.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 3,

156
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:16.254
sounds good to me, amazing.

157
00:08:16.254 --> 00:08:18.768
All right,
there's our set of rules, people.

158
00:08:18.768 --> 00:08:24.034
Let's apply them to each
person starting with Ben,

159
00:08:24.034 --> 00:08:27.871
you got an account longer than a year?

160
00:08:27.871 --> 00:08:28.530
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yep,

161
00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.026
dollars less than 200
in your refund request?

162
00:08:31.026 --> 00:08:33.459
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Accounts less than three

163
00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:34.395
on your IP?

164
00:08:34.395 --> 00:08:35.321
Therefore, what?
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1.

165
00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:39.370
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Therefore,1, so

166
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:45.091
our converted output is 1.

167
00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:47.935
And people,
this may all seem like aha, I got it.

168
00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:52.713
But this is gonna be the foundation of
a building out by the end of the workshop

169
00:08:52.713 --> 00:08:55.336
neural networks with gradient descent.

170
00:08:55.336 --> 00:09:00.603
And all is gonna be an extension
of even this fraud detection tool.

171
00:09:00.603 --> 00:09:05.214
So Joe, years greater than 1 for
your accounts.

172
00:09:05.214 --> 00:09:06.677
&gt;&gt; Joe: No.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: I'm so sorry, Joe.

173
00:09:06.677 --> 00:09:09.009
Yes, no, exactly.

174
00:09:09.009 --> 00:09:11.343
Dollars less than 200, Joe?

175
00:09:11.343 --> 00:09:12.094
&gt;&gt; Joe: No.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No,

176
00:09:12.094 --> 00:09:14.332
accounts on IP less than 3?

177
00:09:14.332 --> 00:09:14.894
&gt;&gt; Joe: Nope.

178
00:09:14.894 --> 00:09:21.173
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No,
therefore, we will say else -1.

179
00:09:21.173 --> 00:09:22.983
There is, okay, it's looking good.

180
00:09:22.983 --> 00:09:26.528
Looking good, our converter's doing
really well for our sample so far.

181
00:09:26.528 --> 00:09:31.028
If it works for our sample, the
assumption, hopefully with a larger sample

182
00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:35.335
than four, the assumption is it will
work for our population as a whole.

183
00:09:35.335 --> 00:09:37.794
Okay, Kayla, you're up.

184
00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:40.623
Years greater than 1?

185
00:09:40.623 --> 00:09:41.549
&gt;&gt; Kayla: Yes.

186
00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:43.582
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Dollars less
than 200 in your refund request?

187
00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:44.626
&gt;&gt; Kayla: Yes.

188
00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.559
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yes,
accounts less than three?

189
00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:47.461
&gt;&gt; Kayla: Yes.

190
00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:52.056
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So
do we have our converter, output?

191
00:09:52.056 --> 00:09:53.863
A one or a minus one for Kayla?

192
00:09:53.863 --> 00:09:56.748
&gt;&gt; Kayla: One.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: One, well done.

193
00:09:56.748 --> 00:10:02.768
Okay, Maria, years greater than 1?

194
00:10:02.768 --> 00:10:03.835
&gt;&gt; Maria: No.

195
00:10:03.835 --> 00:10:05.932
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No, okay, okay.

196
00:10:05.932 --> 00:10:08.087
Dollars less than 200?

197
00:10:08.087 --> 00:10:11.446
&gt;&gt; Maria: No.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No, council IP, yeah.

198
00:10:11.446 --> 00:10:13.294
&gt;&gt; Maria: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So we know that this was

199
00:10:13.294 --> 00:10:14.038
meant to or

200
00:10:14.038 --> 00:10:19.770
should because the door dash customer
service rep historically gave refund one.

201
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.728
We know that this converter should
return out one for our sample.

202
00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:27.194
Right now,
it's returning out what for Maria?

203
00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:30.153
&gt;&gt; Maria: Negative one.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Negative one, exactly.

204
00:10:30.153 --> 00:10:34.979
It has been an adjustment for
me, people, doing this workshop,

205
00:10:34.979 --> 00:10:37.104
realizing that in America.

206
00:10:37.104 --> 00:10:42.368
I love that even years later I discover
new things that I didn't know that it's

207
00:10:42.368 --> 00:10:47.901
not minus 1 but negative 1 there you go
there's a there's a lesson for all of us.

208
00:10:47.901 --> 00:10:56.606
So our accuracy is right now
out of four what is it Maria?

209
00:10:56.606 --> 00:10:58.287
What's our accuracy out of 4 right now?

210
00:10:58.287 --> 00:10:59.890
This one is correct.

211
00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:01.180
This one is what, Maria?

212
00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.524
Yeah, well done, exactly.

213
00:11:02.524 --> 00:11:05.311
Well done Maria, 3 out of 4.

214
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:07.623
That's not good enough for
this tiny sample.

215
00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:09.671
In this sample,
we can definitely get 4 out of 4.

216
00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:10.636
So what do we do?

217
00:11:10.636 --> 00:11:12.361
We tweak our converter.

218
00:11:12.361 --> 00:11:14.879
Maria, convert this.

219
00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:17.934
Let's assume we'll keep it at greater
than, not like go to greater than, or

220
00:11:17.934 --> 00:11:19.706
equal to, what could we tweak this to?

221
00:11:19.706 --> 00:11:20.588
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.5.

222
00:11:20.588 --> 00:11:21.868
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0.5, sure, yeah or

223
00:11:21.868 --> 00:11:24.372
if you just wanna just
make it work what I mean?

224
00:11:24.372 --> 00:11:28.453
Just make it work,
we could tweak it to 0.9, right?

225
00:11:28.453 --> 00:11:30.437
Yeah, but just make it work.

226
00:11:30.437 --> 00:11:31.312
Yeah, brilliant.

227
00:11:31.312 --> 00:11:38.278
So now Maria is passing here, 200 rather
than, I'm gonna be a bit cheeky here.

228
00:11:38.278 --> 00:11:40.099
I'm gonna say it doesn't matter,
you don't pass that one.

229
00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:46.733
Let's add another rule, we'll learn
the name of these rules in a second,

230
00:11:46.733 --> 00:11:51.174
but add another rule,
maybe 2 of 3 must be true.

231
00:11:51.174 --> 00:11:54.162
So if one of them isn't true,
still give out a one.

232
00:11:54.162 --> 00:12:01.532
So now Maria, account greater than
0.9 years, dollars less than 200.

233
00:12:01.532 --> 00:12:06.681
No accounts less than 3,
yes, 2 out of 3, true, yes.

234
00:12:06.681 --> 00:12:09.890
So now Maria is outputs 1, and

235
00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:15.082
we have successful conversion and
our accuracy.

236
00:12:15.082 --> 00:12:17.691
Maria is now?

237
00:12:17.691 --> 00:12:20.966
&gt;&gt; Maria: 4.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yay, [LAUGH] good stuff.

238
00:12:20.966 --> 00:12:21.547
Let's give Maria a hand.

239
00:12:21.547 --> 00:12:22.501
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Well done, Maria.

240
00:12:22.501 --> 00:12:23.575
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].

241
00:12:23.575 --> 00:12:27.119
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Maria's
helped fix our converter.

242
00:12:27.119 --> 00:12:31.942
We've identified the rules,
the boundaries, the max or min values for

243
00:12:31.942 --> 00:12:33.453
our background data.

244
00:12:33.453 --> 00:12:37.564
This background information on each
request that convert as many of the sample

245
00:12:37.564 --> 00:12:39.694
correctly as possible to their labels.

246
00:12:39.694 --> 00:12:47.259
1 or -1 a best fit, we fitted this
set of this converter for our sample.
