00:00:00.143 --> 00:00:05.425
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Figuring out or
learning the multipliers for

2
00:00:05.425 --> 00:00:09.737
all the pixels with a larger sample.

3
00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:12.485
There's our familiar smile at the top.

4
00:00:16.178 --> 00:00:18.780
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Someone in this
room doubted that that was a smile,

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:19.756
no doubt anymore.

6
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:25.360
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Someone who
should not be named doubted.

7
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.974
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: There's a familiar,
not smile.

8
00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:34.376
There's that image we were using as
validation originally, not smile,

9
00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:35.513
or the flat mouth.

10
00:00:35.513 --> 00:00:38.368
That's gonna now be a new
image in our training,

11
00:00:38.368 --> 00:00:42.210
in a sample that we're gonna use
to come up with our multipliers.

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.111
That's not a smile.

13
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:49.617
And then we've got another very cheery
smile, also undoubtedly, just squint.

14
00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:50.995
And I promise, you're gonna see.

15
00:00:53.218 --> 00:00:54.889
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: That's a smile.

16
00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.748
All right, excellent,
smile not, not smile.

17
00:00:58.748 --> 00:00:59.843
There's our new data set.

18
00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:04.911
We need a process to figure out
the multipliers that convert as many

19
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:10.615
of these pixels in the sample to match
their associated label as possible,

20
00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:13.162
once our sample is too big to see.

21
00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:16.591
Maybe you can look at these four and
figure out the multipliers that work, but

22
00:01:16.591 --> 00:01:19.040
honestly already,
I'm pretty impressed if you can.

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.372
And go any bigger than this?

24
00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:21.455
You definitely can't.

25
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:25.666
We need a technique, and
we can't brute force all the multipliers,

26
00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.778
try every possible combination.

27
00:01:27.778 --> 00:01:32.742
Because, suppose we only had
the chars that have -1, 0, and 1,

28
00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:34.552
and then there's 12.

29
00:01:34.552 --> 00:01:36.286
That's actually not impossibly large.

30
00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:37.296
What's the math for that?

31
00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:40.031
How many combinations are there for that?

32
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:41.265
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 1,000.

33
00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:41.846
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Is it?

34
00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:45.741
That was for 0s and 1s,
you've got an extra bit here.

35
00:01:45.741 --> 00:01:46.934
So it's already bigger than that.

36
00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:49.512
Yeah, so it's 3 to the power of 12,

37
00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:54.373
if anyone wants to tell me what that is,
but it's not that massively big.

38
00:01:54.373 --> 00:01:56.356
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 530,000-ish.

39
00:01:56.356 --> 00:02:01.227
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: That's half
a million combinations of -1, 0 and

40
00:02:01.227 --> 00:02:03.118
1 for our weights.

41
00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:04.552
Already that size.

42
00:02:04.552 --> 00:02:08.904
And you can therefore see, and
we've got to then apply every

43
00:02:08.904 --> 00:02:14.192
combination of that to all the pixels
to see, to all the samples, sorry,

44
00:02:14.192 --> 00:02:19.596
to see whether x combination converts
more or less of them to their target.

45
00:02:19.596 --> 00:02:21.374
Let's have thumbs on that idea.

46
00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:25.125
I don't get what you're saying,
I'm clear clarifications on.

47
00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:27.385
I need to have a set of multipliers here.

48
00:02:27.385 --> 00:02:30.289
We've got these two together,
it's worked for sample of two.

49
00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:35.010
We have a sample of four,
we're gonna need to try in theory,

50
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.212
every brute force, every single
combination, -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0,

51
00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:46.607
-1 -1 0 0 0 0, -1 -1 -1 0 0 0 0,
every combination.

52
00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:53.504
There's actually half a million for just
the value of -1, 0, or 1 across these 12.

53
00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:55.702
There's half a million permutations.

54
00:02:55.702 --> 00:03:01.953
Thumbs on whether, and we'd have to apply
every one of those to our sample to see,

55
00:03:01.953 --> 00:03:06.209
does it convert to 1, -1,
and then for our next two,

56
00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.123
which we're gonna do in a second,
respectively, -1 and 1.

57
00:03:11.123 --> 00:03:13.642
And you might be like, well,
I can quickly figure it out, sure.

58
00:03:13.642 --> 00:03:17.106
But in theory, we could brute force,
try every single one and

59
00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:18.714
find which ones do convert.

60
00:03:18.714 --> 00:03:20.754
Let's add our two extra sample elements.

61
00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:22.007
Help me out.

62
00:03:22.007 --> 00:03:23.469
No, maybe, I'll just write that up.

63
00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.647
I don't wanna make you all
shout out one and zero again.

64
00:03:25.647 --> 00:03:31.042
1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1,

65
00:03:31.042 --> 00:03:33.947
is this, Nick,

66
00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:39.147
a smiley face or a -1, not?

67
00:03:39.147 --> 00:03:40.249
&gt;&gt; Nick: -1, not.

68
00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:43.119
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, -1, it's not.

69
00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:44.519
Exactly, -1.

70
00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.018
We can see that when we draw
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: On

71
00:03:50.018 --> 00:03:53.032
it's not, there we go.

72
00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.569
It's like a frog.

73
00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.681
And then our final one

74
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:04.793
we will have 1 0 1 0

75
00:04:04.793 --> 00:04:09.905
0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0,

76
00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:13.887
look how happy.

77
00:04:13.887 --> 00:04:16.907
That's the happiest face I've ever seen.

78
00:04:16.907 --> 00:04:20.502
So is this Smile, Nick, 1 or -1?

79
00:04:20.502 --> 00:04:21.023
&gt;&gt; Nick: 1.

80
00:04:21.023 --> 00:04:21.855
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, this is a smile.

81
00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:26.638
Okay, we now need to figure out how
to convert another set of 12 pixels,

82
00:04:26.638 --> 00:04:29.879
and their position,
it's not just 12 pixels,

83
00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.843
it's 12 pixels in their position,
pixel is number in position, right?

84
00:04:34.843 --> 00:04:37.155
It's not just numbers,
it's numbers in a position.

85
00:04:37.155 --> 00:04:41.315
This pixel matters,
the number is 1 here, not here.

86
00:04:41.315 --> 00:04:43.209
And then the same thing for this one.

87
00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:45.577
We know multipliers now do work for
all four.

88
00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:51.513
Our target output is respectively,
1 -1, -1, 1.

89
00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:54.434
Our accuracy, Maria, is out of what now?

90
00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:56.186
Our accuracy is out of what?

91
00:04:56.186 --> 00:04:57.882
&gt;&gt; Maria: 4.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 4, what on?

92
00:04:57.882 --> 00:04:59.873
Sweet, brilliant.

93
00:04:59.873 --> 00:05:03.446
Okay, so, how the heck are we
gonna come up with the weights?

94
00:05:03.446 --> 00:05:07.019
I know we came up with them well for
here, but it's not gonna work.

95
00:05:07.019 --> 00:05:08.809
I can't eyeball this even before.

96
00:05:08.809 --> 00:05:12.988
Maybe you can, certainly not for a sample
of a hundred thousand or even a million.

97
00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:16.853
Well, we don't have a million images here,
3 by 4, it's only got an option of 4,096.

98
00:05:16.853 --> 00:05:20.958
But any bigger set of images,
any bigger pixel set,

99
00:05:20.958 --> 00:05:24.327
10 by 10, and you got a lot of samples.

100
00:05:24.327 --> 00:05:26.445
So what do we do?

101
00:05:26.445 --> 00:05:27.643
Here's what we do.

102
00:05:27.643 --> 00:05:34.007
We start with 0s for
all 12 multipliers, all 12 weights.

103
00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:36.360
We start with 0s.

104
00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.103
It's pretty clever how this,
we're gonna see.

105
00:05:39.103 --> 00:05:43.208
Start with 0s for all of them in
our matrix and our grid of numbers.

106
00:05:43.208 --> 00:05:50.072
And then we, one by one, compute for
each multiplier, each weight.

107
00:05:50.072 --> 00:05:53.452
Is it better to tweak it up slightly or

108
00:05:53.452 --> 00:05:58.794
down slightly to convert in doing so
more of our images to,

109
00:05:58.794 --> 00:06:03.277
that's the 12 pixels,
to our correct label?

110
00:06:06.487 --> 00:06:11.245
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And
then something wild is gonna allow us to

111
00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:14.026
change them all at once.

112
00:06:14.026 --> 00:06:19.398
And hopefully get closer to more of our,
or all of our sample eventually,

113
00:06:19.398 --> 00:06:24.699
being converted correctly between
the 12 pixel values and the label.

114
00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:27.076
The larger the sample,
the more conversion we get,

115
00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:30.166
the better it's gonna work on
the rest of our population, we hope.

116
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:34.644
Not 2 out of 4,096, but
maybe hundreds out of 4,096.

117
00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:39.436
Not two out of, let's say,
a million sample, for

118
00:06:39.436 --> 00:06:44.911
larger images, but maybe 100,
000 in our sample.

119
00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:49.906
That's the only way we're gonna be able
to do that, is if we can find a shortcut,

120
00:06:49.906 --> 00:06:54.828
an optimization to figuring out the best
set of multipliers that convert as many

121
00:06:54.828 --> 00:06:58.512
of this to this, this to this,
this to this, this to this.

122
00:06:58.512 --> 00:07:02.113
So right now,
our maximum could be four out of four.

123
00:07:02.113 --> 00:07:06.154
But for any large sample,
it could be 80,000 out of 100,000.

124
00:07:06.154 --> 00:07:11.156
And we're gonna run these 12
numbers on all 100,000 images and

125
00:07:11.156 --> 00:07:15.175
see how many of them,
the total comes to the total we want.

126
00:07:15.175 --> 00:07:20.466
We wanna have 80%, maybe 90% of
them coming to the total we want.

127
00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:25.964
For our sample of four,
we want probably four out of four.

128
00:07:25.964 --> 00:07:28.432
Four out of four would be good,
for our sample of four.

129
00:07:28.432 --> 00:07:30.700
But for a larger sample, 90% maybe.

130
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.463
Okay, so let's do it.

131
00:07:32.463 --> 00:07:37.073
So multipliers of 0, what's our converted
output for the first image here, Kayla?

132
00:07:37.073 --> 00:07:41.471
All the multipliers are 0, so what's our
total for our converted output, Kayla?

133
00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:43.910
&gt;&gt; Kayla: 0.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, but the next one,

134
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:48.132
what's our converted output for
the next one, Kayla?

135
00:07:48.132 --> 00:07:49.002
&gt;&gt; Kayla: 0.

136
00:07:49.002 --> 00:07:50.004
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay, yeah.

137
00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:51.536
All right, and the next one?

138
00:07:51.536 --> 00:07:53.475
&gt;&gt; Kayla: 0.

139
00:07:53.475 --> 00:07:55.910
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Smiley face.

140
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.062
But the next one?

141
00:07:57.062 --> 00:07:58.404
&gt;&gt; Kayla: [LAUGH] 0.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay, all right, so

142
00:07:58.404 --> 00:07:59.292
it's all right.

143
00:07:59.292 --> 00:08:02.992
So our accuracy currently is, out of four?

144
00:08:02.992 --> 00:08:04.912
&gt;&gt; Kayla: 0.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, beautiful.

145
00:08:04.912 --> 00:08:05.912
&gt;&gt; Kayla: I was trained.

146
00:08:05.912 --> 00:08:07.486
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: [LAUGH] Thank you,
exactly well.

147
00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:12.374
Nice machine learning, pun,
machine learning joke, there.

148
00:08:12.374 --> 00:08:15.722
Okay, now, very good.

149
00:08:15.722 --> 00:08:18.967
Now, accuracy's here out of four.

150
00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:21.308
We've got to start somewhere.

151
00:08:21.308 --> 00:08:22.967
We start with 0s, okay?

152
00:08:22.967 --> 00:08:28.902
Now, let's try jolting this one up.

153
00:08:28.902 --> 00:08:31.401
Let's try going up with this one to a 1.

154
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:35.888
I don't think we're gonna need to now do
our calculations on the board in full, and

155
00:08:35.888 --> 00:08:38.337
say, 00, but rather, we can have a look.

156
00:08:38.337 --> 00:08:39.312
Let's go around.

157
00:08:39.312 --> 00:08:43.281
Jamie, can you tell me what the output of,
with a 1 here,

158
00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:48.233
we had 0 for all 0s, what's the output
of the first image gonna be now?

159
00:08:48.233 --> 00:08:48.863
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 1.

160
00:08:48.863 --> 00:08:50.291
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, spot on, exactly.

161
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:51.034
Thank you.

162
00:08:51.034 --> 00:08:54.899
1, so that's an improvement.

163
00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:58.822
That's better than it was conversion.

164
00:08:58.822 --> 00:09:03.337
And for this one,
the output's gonna still be 0.

165
00:09:03.337 --> 00:09:05.374
So that's no change, no better.

166
00:09:05.374 --> 00:09:08.033
For this one?

167
00:09:08.033 --> 00:09:09.400
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 1.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1,

168
00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.592
that's actually worse, right?

169
00:09:12.592 --> 00:09:15.534
It's got further away from the target,
which was -1.

170
00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:16.718
It got worse.

171
00:09:16.718 --> 00:09:20.430
This one, the output, Jamie, is gonna be?

172
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.748
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 1.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, which is better.

173
00:09:22.748 --> 00:09:28.775
So, that's kind of fun,
tweaking up the lower

174
00:09:28.775 --> 00:09:33.908
middle is going to make how many better?

175
00:09:33.908 --> 00:09:35.378
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 2.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 2, how many worse?

176
00:09:35.378 --> 00:09:35.994
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 1.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And

177
00:09:35.994 --> 00:09:36.991
how many no different?

178
00:09:36.991 --> 00:09:37.959
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 1.

179
00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:41.237
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So accuracy,
I would say, roughly, has got?

180
00:09:41.237 --> 00:09:43.005
Better.
Better, overall, exactly.

181
00:09:43.005 --> 00:09:46.551
Our accuracy has gone up
across the full sample.

182
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:49.003
So, I think we can confidently say,

183
00:09:49.003 --> 00:09:53.275
if we increase the value of
the multiplier in the bottom middle,

184
00:09:53.275 --> 00:09:58.354
which we also remember, right, it was
a 1 when we did it for our other side.

185
00:09:58.354 --> 00:10:01.291
So we are not surprised by this, per say.

186
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:04.248
Then we know the direction
to go on that multiplier.

187
00:10:04.248 --> 00:10:07.656
Okay, now we get rid of it all.

188
00:10:07.656 --> 00:10:08.768
Forget it ever happened.

189
00:10:08.768 --> 00:10:13.037
Forget it ever happened and
we do it all over again.

190
00:10:13.037 --> 00:10:18.706
We forget it ever happened, and that's
crucial people, we do it all over again.

191
00:10:18.706 --> 00:10:21.833
But now, 4,

192
00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:26.795
that's now 0 again.

193
00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:28.880
To our totals again, now,
everybody, are what?

194
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:37.303
0, 0, 0, 0, and now let's try
tweaking this bottom right up again.

195
00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.224
Well, let's try it again.

196
00:10:39.224 --> 00:10:42.110
Okay, top one, Ben.

197
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.401
Output is gonna be with
this new all 0s and 1s.

198
00:10:45.401 --> 00:10:48.022
Just this one is gonna be 1, 1 on.

199
00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:50.047
Okay, better, better.

200
00:10:50.047 --> 00:10:51.582
There goes my American accent.

201
00:10:51.582 --> 00:10:53.870
This one here, output's gonna be?

202
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.496
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1.

203
00:10:54.496 --> 00:10:57.132
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, uh-oh.

204
00:10:57.132 --> 00:10:58.329
Better or worse, Ben?

205
00:10:58.329 --> 00:10:59.542
&gt;&gt; Ben: Worse.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Worse,

206
00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:03.151
output of this one gonna be 1 1.

207
00:11:03.151 --> 00:11:04.920
1, better or worse, everybody?

208
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.923
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Worse.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Worse, well done.

209
00:11:07.923 --> 00:11:13.146
Output of this one,
still gonna be 0, so no change.

210
00:11:13.146 --> 00:11:18.581
Okay, have we improved
our overall accuracy?

211
00:11:18.581 --> 00:11:22.606
Is it better overall or worse overall with
our tweaking up the bottom right one?

212
00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:23.469
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Worse.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Worse,

213
00:11:23.469 --> 00:11:24.521
well done, people.

214
00:11:24.521 --> 00:11:28.843
So going up, worse, going down, better.

215
00:11:28.843 --> 00:11:33.185
We can show it, but going down, better.

216
00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:35.374
If we went to, I suppose we could do it,
couldn't for a second.

217
00:11:35.374 --> 00:11:39.927
We'd have a -1 here, we'd have a -1 here,
we'd have a -1 here, -1 here,

218
00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:41.701
0 here, and this one be worse.

219
00:11:41.701 --> 00:11:43.682
We'd have two better, one worse.

220
00:11:43.682 --> 00:11:47.383
So going down here, better.

221
00:11:47.383 --> 00:11:52.043
And then we get rid of it all again, and

222
00:11:52.043 --> 00:11:55.547
go back to 0 all over again.

223
00:11:55.547 --> 00:11:56.441
Anyone wanna do it again?

224
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:58.334
Okay, let me show-
&gt;&gt; Jamie: So

225
00:11:58.334 --> 00:12:03.793
we can deduce the bottom left
corner is also better, down?

226
00:12:03.793 --> 00:12:06.231
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yes.
Yes, is Jamie right, everyone?

227
00:12:06.231 --> 00:12:06.893
Yeah, well done.

228
00:12:06.893 --> 00:12:08.342
Good deduction.

229
00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:12.502
And then, actually, this one's better,
down, this one's better, up,

230
00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:14.042
this one's better, down.

231
00:12:14.042 --> 00:12:17.973
And then these ones, roughly, no change.

232
00:12:17.973 --> 00:12:20.449
So, Jamie was spot on there.

233
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:24.002
When we could have kept going and checked
this one as well, if you wanna do that.

234
00:12:24.002 --> 00:12:29.538
[LAUGH] But if you check each of them,
but remember each time, get back to 0.

235
00:12:29.538 --> 00:12:32.652
It starts all over again.

236
00:12:32.652 --> 00:12:34.644
Forget you ever did the other ones.

237
00:12:34.644 --> 00:12:37.354
Start all over again, go from 0.

238
00:12:37.354 --> 00:12:39.891
In this case,
go from what it is right now.
