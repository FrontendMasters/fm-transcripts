WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.615
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay, let's double
check, and then we're gonna start to

2
00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:08.955
learn some of the fancy terms for
all these pieces.z But

3
00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:13.681
let's double check our converter
on some more sample data.

4
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:19.601
So actually, from our sample where we
know both the background information.

5
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:24.569
And the label, let's get a bit we
didn't actually use to come up

6
00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:29.448
with the converter to check
whether the converter is working.

7
00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:35.489
Because this is going to be a crucial
part of developing our converters,

8
00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.642
making sure we don't get the converter
to work perfectly for our sample.

9
00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.493
We literally tweaked it.

10
00:00:43.493 --> 00:00:47.288
We watched Maria go, shoot,
it didn't quite work.

11
00:00:47.288 --> 00:00:48.583
Let's change it.

12
00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:53.445
Now, that might be capturing
the underlying pattern of the overall

13
00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:58.993
population, the underlying rules
implicitly of the overall population for

14
00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:04.282
converting background info into refund
decision or it might be getting it

15
00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:10.450
perfect for the sample, but then doesn't
work very well for the rest of population.

16
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.111
So we wanna check that we didn't use our
sample only to get perfect conversion for

17
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:17.777
our sample, but not for

18
00:01:17.777 --> 00:01:22.538
our overall population that may
not be exact what it shouldn't be.

19
00:01:22.538 --> 00:01:26.286
If we only have 100%
conversion on our sample,

20
00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:31.080
then unless our population is
100% identical to our sample,

21
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.330
it is not going to necessarily be
a great converter for our population.

22
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.071
We'll see more of this to come,
but let's then for

23
00:01:41.071 --> 00:01:45.371
now, double check it on
a new refund request,

24
00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:50.682
the way we do know what
the customer service rep decided.

25
00:01:50.682 --> 00:01:53.493
So I think we're gonna have me.

26
00:01:53.493 --> 00:01:55.765
Yay.

27
00:01:55.765 --> 00:02:02.143
Me and unlike Joe.

28
00:02:02.143 --> 00:02:05.047
I did get my refund request.

29
00:02:05.047 --> 00:02:06.956
How very classes of me.

30
00:02:06.956 --> 00:02:08.449
I'm very sorry, Joe.

31
00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.329
I certainly should have
been the one who didn't.

32
00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.195
But there it is, refund one.

33
00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:19.370
Let's now go ahead and
validate our converter.

34
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.468
Validation.

35
00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:27.180
Let's put in, well, let's say I
had two years, small refund and

36
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.896
only one account on the IP and
therefore the customer service rep,

37
00:02:32.896 --> 00:02:37.812
well, for maybe many reasons
we don't know, said one.

38
00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:41.188
Let's apply our conversion tool.

39
00:02:41.188 --> 00:02:44.029
Let's apply our converter.

40
00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:47.240
I'll just use this little blue.

41
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.193
This is our converter we're applying.

42
00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:56.010
Nick, account longer than 0.9 years for
Will?

43
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.554
Yes.
Dollars less than 200.

44
00:02:58.554 --> 00:02:59.882
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yes.

45
00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:01.824
Account for IP less than three
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yes

46
00:03:01.824 --> 00:03:03.300
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yes.

47
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.074
Do I get a refund?

48
00:03:05.074 --> 00:03:06.630
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yes,
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yes, and

49
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.818
we know the customer service rep said so
too.

50
00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:18.285
And so the accuracy on our
validation data is one out of one.

51
00:03:18.285 --> 00:03:23.689
So for our converter trying to
capture the patterns the data

52
00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:29.202
that is associated with giving a refund or
not in our sample,

53
00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:33.635
we are doing rather nicely
with our validation,

54
00:03:33.635 --> 00:03:39.470
with our checking of that on a new
piece of data, a new instance,

55
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.765
fancy word for bit, in this case,
request of our sample,

56
00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:48.911
which we did not use to
come up with the rules.

57
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.482
And we check it, and it does nicely.

58
00:03:51.482 --> 00:03:57.007
Now, in practice, people,
we have 100,000 elements in our sample.

59
00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:03.277
We'd put 80,000 of them towards coming
up with the right conversion values and

60
00:04:03.277 --> 00:04:06.771
maybe 20,000, 20% in the checking.

61
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:11.650
Now, people, we can apply our
converter to new refund requests where

62
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.219
we do not have the customer
service reps decision.

63
00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:18.475
We do have a label and
we can make a prediction.

64
00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:20.074
All right, let's do it.

65
00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:22.209
Let's do It.

66
00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:24.190
Who are we doing?

67
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.477
We're doing Paul.

68
00:04:26.477 --> 00:04:27.697
Okay, pool.

69
00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:30.442
Paul is rather clever.

70
00:04:30.442 --> 00:04:34.862
Paul has their account for one year.

71
00:04:34.862 --> 00:04:36.844
Okay, looks good.

72
00:04:36.844 --> 00:04:40.213
How much are they spending?

73
00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:45.997
Refunding just to keep
it under the threshold,

74
00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:49.042
Paul, what do we think?

75
00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:50.327
1.99.

76
00:04:50.327 --> 00:04:56.140
1.99, Paul thinks like a true criminal.

77
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.933
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: How many accounts on

78
00:04:58.933 --> 00:05:00.253
Paul's IP?

79
00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:02.120
I mean, too many to count.

80
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.506
Paul's running a full-on bot farm for
refunds but

81
00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:10.897
we don't know whether to give a refund or
not here.

82
00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:14.658
We're going to use our automated decision.

83
00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:19.905
Each year goes by, my crouching
on the whiteboard gets harder.

84
00:05:19.905 --> 00:05:24.226
All right, what decision will we get?

85
00:05:24.226 --> 00:05:30.401
Paul, greater than 0.9
years account history?

86
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.327
You bet.

87
00:05:31.327 --> 00:05:33.025
Under 200?

88
00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:33.951
You bet.

89
00:05:33.951 --> 00:05:37.344
Accounts on IP less than three?

90
00:05:37.344 --> 00:05:39.372
Absolutely not.

91
00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:46.377
But with our converter two out of three
is true, do we give poorly refund?

92
00:05:46.377 --> 00:05:47.673
You bet we do.

93
00:05:47.673 --> 00:05:55.048
And this is the 150th refund
Paul's got that day of a $199.

94
00:05:55.048 --> 00:06:00.672
Dear, we're experiencing here
immediately a key challenge with any,

95
00:06:00.672 --> 00:06:05.278
we'll see the fancy name for
our converter in a moment, but

96
00:06:05.278 --> 00:06:10.644
a key challenge with any of these,
which is something called drift.

97
00:06:10.644 --> 00:06:15.772
The notion of drift, our sample that
we use to get a perfect conversion,

98
00:06:15.772 --> 00:06:20.325
perfectly captured the nature of our,
so we even validated it.

99
00:06:20.325 --> 00:06:25.616
I know there are only four elements, and
of course, in practice we'd use many

100
00:06:25.616 --> 00:06:30.988
many more and hopefully catch the nature
of Paul's behavior, but we didn't,

101
00:06:30.988 --> 00:06:36.064
and so along comes Paul and our population
is not reflective of our sample.

102
00:06:36.064 --> 00:06:37.534
Paul's character,

103
00:06:37.534 --> 00:06:43.339
Paul's pattern of behavior has drifted
away from our sample's characteristics.

104
00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:48.125
And actually this is a key part of
deploying a model in production is

105
00:06:48.125 --> 00:06:52.399
maintaining or
minimizing what's called concept drift,

106
00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:58.039
a movement away of the definition of
the problem you're even looking at here or

107
00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.920
certainly a moving away,

108
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.071
in this case of the characteristics
of the population from the sample.

109
00:07:05.071 --> 00:07:08.629
Or you could just say our
sample is way too small and

110
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:12.966
doesn't capture but definitionally,
this is our sample.

111
00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:14.290
It is a match.

112
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.247
Something is up Paul's.

113
00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:21.251
And by the way, this is a big
part of fraud detection models.

114
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:27.801
If you have people like Paul, who decide
my goal is to work out almost pen test,

115
00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:32.568
penetration test,
what these boundaries might be that I

116
00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:37.434
can get away with coming back
again to vote manipulation,

117
00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:43.193
then you'll be looking for what
are the maximums you can get to before

118
00:07:43.193 --> 00:07:48.989
you get shadow banned on Twitter or
wherever, on X or whatever it is.

119
00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:53.953
Okay, so people,
we're gonna have thumbs on this because

120
00:07:53.953 --> 00:07:57.131
in a moment we're gonna go through and

121
00:07:57.131 --> 00:08:01.717
start to give the fancy names for
each of these pieces.

122
00:08:01.717 --> 00:08:07.960
And then talk about how this plays into
the discipline of machine learning.

123
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.703
Wait, thumbs on taking our sample
with our matching data for

124
00:08:12.703 --> 00:08:16.609
each instance, each person,
each request, and

125
00:08:16.609 --> 00:08:20.980
identifying the rules to do
the matching in our sample,

126
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:27.124
then checking that that matching is a good
set of rules on our validation data.

127
00:08:27.124 --> 00:08:30.850
In fact, we check it on
20,000 we checked on one, and

128
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:35.035
then being able to use it on a new
future refund request of Paul's.

129
00:08:35.035 --> 00:08:38.587
And I know it's kind of lame
that it then didn't work.

130
00:08:38.587 --> 00:08:39.313
It did work.

131
00:08:39.313 --> 00:08:40.685
It made a prediction.

132
00:08:40.685 --> 00:08:41.691
Is it a good one?

133
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:44.577
No, but it did make a prediction,
very bad one.

134
00:08:44.577 --> 00:08:47.863
Perhaps because Paul is brilliant and
pushed and

135
00:08:47.863 --> 00:08:50.436
drifted away the population nature.

136
00:08:50.436 --> 00:08:55.161
And actually, by the way, it's a huge
part of production engineering for

137
00:08:55.161 --> 00:08:59.886
this space, because maintaining
the similarity even just going from this

138
00:08:59.886 --> 00:09:04.536
being done with the customer service
rep to this being automated is a shift

139
00:09:04.536 --> 00:09:09.111
in the nature of a refund request from
I have to chat with someone to do it to

140
00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:11.078
I can press a button and get it.

141
00:09:11.078 --> 00:09:15.032
That immediately leads half of
the population to drift apart.

142
00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:20.088
But let's have thumbs on you lost me,
I'm clear, I want clarifications,

143
00:09:20.088 --> 00:09:24.670
woo-woo, no clarifications,
people are Paul, Nick, go ahead,

144
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.358
Nick, please give us a clarification.

145
00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:30.393
&gt;&gt; Ben: Is this always, like, a yes or no?

146
00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:33.482
Like, is there, like, weighted averages or
anything applied to this kind of stuff?

147
00:09:33.482 --> 00:09:35.826
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, absolutely.

148
00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:40.342
We can definitely, and we'll see,
especially when we implement

149
00:09:40.342 --> 00:09:45.501
alternative models or alternative we'll
see the name for them in a moment,

150
00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:50.420
alternative converters that we
absolutely can get to some distribution

151
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:55.440
of probabilities, some threshold amount,
some levels of confidence.

152
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.780
Absolutely, we'll see that
play out in a moment.

153
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.396
Okay, how do we identify the boundaries?

154
00:10:01.396 --> 00:10:04.396
We actually already started
pointing this with Ben.

155
00:10:04.396 --> 00:10:08.696
Ben, how did we go about identifying
these boundaries with which part of your,

156
00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:11.021
actually, this is not a classy question.

157
00:10:11.021 --> 00:10:12.625
With which part of your face.

158
00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:13.881
Okay, that's not good.

159
00:10:13.881 --> 00:10:17.368
How did you go about identifying
these boundaries, Ben?

160
00:10:17.368 --> 00:10:19.432
&gt;&gt; Ben: Just looking at the lowest value.

161
00:10:19.432 --> 00:10:20.300
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, okay.

162
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.379
&gt;&gt; Ben: That was accepted.

163
00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:27.984
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, sorry to talk
over you yeah, that's exactly right.

164
00:10:27.984 --> 00:10:33.612
Like looking at with one's eyes,
with our eyes,

165
00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:40.314
that's possible for
example four with well, four rules.

166
00:10:40.314 --> 00:10:44.895
Is that possible for
100,000 in the sample,

167
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:51.676
we might have 100,000 data values
attached to every single request?

168
00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:56.948
What if I have a time series that's
data over a period of time for

169
00:10:56.948 --> 00:11:00.142
every dollar spent by that customer.

170
00:11:00.142 --> 00:11:04.010
What if I have detailed
information on their interaction

171
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:07.643
with the app in the moments
leading up to the request?

172
00:11:07.643 --> 00:11:12.448
These are all profoundly large data
sets where every single one of them

173
00:11:12.448 --> 00:11:17.335
might have a boundary that is pertinent,
might have a boundary where if

174
00:11:17.335 --> 00:11:21.570
they've spent this much money
yesterday on the day before for

175
00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.254
this much less,
that might be the important factor.

176
00:11:25.254 --> 00:11:29.981
If they took these sorts of pattern of
actions before they made the refund

177
00:11:29.981 --> 00:11:33.090
request, that might be
the important factor.

178
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.432
There's no way we can eyeball that.

179
00:11:35.432 --> 00:11:38.296
We're gonna need some techniques to do so.
