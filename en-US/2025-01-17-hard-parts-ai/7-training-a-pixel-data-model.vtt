00:00:00.023 --> 00:00:05.511
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Now our job,
can we possibly build,

2
00:00:05.511 --> 00:00:11.891
just as before, can we build a converter?

3
00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:15.638
Can we create our converter?

4
00:00:15.638 --> 00:00:20.598
Everyone, what's the real name of
the converter that's converting these

5
00:00:20.598 --> 00:00:22.000
pixels into a value?

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.192
What do we call converters?

7
00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:24.766
Not converters, we call them?

8
00:00:24.766 --> 00:00:25.497
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Models.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Models,

9
00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:27.672
well done, people,
that was a risk, wasn't it?

10
00:00:27.672 --> 00:00:29.233
Good job, models.

11
00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:33.807
And we're gonna use our sample for
our training stage.

12
00:00:33.807 --> 00:00:35.648
You see, it's exactly the same.

13
00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:38.008
Okay, let's get our sample in place.

14
00:00:38.008 --> 00:00:44.583
So we have 1 0 1, 0 0 0, 1 1 1, 1 1 0.

15
00:00:44.583 --> 00:00:52.416
And that's our
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Smile 1, beautiful.

16
00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:57.159
Then we have another element of
our sample, it's a tiny sample,

17
00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:00.705
but allows us to visualize
it on the blackboard.

18
00:01:00.705 --> 00:01:04.397
And unfortunately I've never used a
computer, so I don't know how to do that.

19
00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.949
[LAUGH] There you go, Smile -1.

20
00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:13.742
So, we have 12 numbers, that's all it is.

21
00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:15.165
That's how an image is represented.

22
00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:16.734
That's what it's under the hood.

23
00:01:16.734 --> 00:01:18.338
I know to us it looks like a face.

24
00:01:18.338 --> 00:01:21.280
And this of course,
looks exactly like a face.

25
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.800
But under the hood is with pixels, dark
and light and or, you could say bright and

26
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.410
dim, whichever way you
wanna think about it.

27
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.365
And then a value attached to it,
Smile 1 or Smile -1,

28
00:01:32.365 --> 00:01:34.900
just like Refund 1, Refund -1.

29
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.608
Okay, and then we have to
develop some way to convert

30
00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:45.929
these 12 numbers and
their positions into 1,

31
00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.718
and these 12 numbers into -1.

32
00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:57.337
If we can work out that converter,
then we can apply it to this image and

33
00:01:57.337 --> 00:02:01.222
identify 1 or -1, smile or not.

34
00:02:01.222 --> 00:02:02.686
Pretty cool.

35
00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:04.245
How do we do it?

36
00:02:04.245 --> 00:02:07.755
Well, neural networks.

37
00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:11.341
For images, and really for
much other labeled data,

38
00:02:11.341 --> 00:02:16.614
that is data with associated label,
the game was changed by neural networks.

39
00:02:16.614 --> 00:02:20.704
Introduced decades and decades ago,
but took off in the last twenty years.

40
00:02:20.704 --> 00:02:25.155
And really transformed in the last five,
a little pun there,

41
00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:28.580
as we'll see under large language models,
but

42
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.299
also many different models where
transformers are a vital part.

43
00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:38.320
They can interpret images and much data
better than really, anything else.

44
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.655
To the point that data sets that have
previously been used to test out how

45
00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:44.180
good is your converter.

46
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.532
And you go and download a data set off the
Internet to check how good your converter

47
00:02:49.532 --> 00:02:55.374
is, like one called MNIST, MNIST, National
Institute of Standards and Technology.

48
00:02:55.374 --> 00:03:00.408
Developed in the 80s with USPS to

49
00:03:00.408 --> 00:03:05.268
help better classify, or sort,

50
00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:10.822
their mail parcels by having a big data

51
00:03:10.822 --> 00:03:15.872
set of hand drawn, messy digits.

52
00:03:15.872 --> 00:03:19.789
And then the label for
them of 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8,

53
00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:25.021
to be able to interpret zip codes
potentially automatically, recognize,

54
00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:29.544
look at an image of a hand-drawn 7,
and then spot, is that a 7?

55
00:03:29.544 --> 00:03:31.317
A hand-drawn 8, is that an 8?

56
00:03:31.317 --> 00:03:32.938
Hand-drawn 2, is that a 2?

57
00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:36.557
That MNIST dataset, I mean,
I'm not saying completely redundant now.

58
00:03:36.557 --> 00:03:39.561
But neural networks,
modern neural networks are so

59
00:03:39.561 --> 00:03:43.043
good at capturing and
classifying those images that you need

60
00:03:43.043 --> 00:03:45.785
harder bench-marking
data sets to work with.

61
00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:51.376
And that only really was achieved in
the last 10, 12, 15, and a push years.

62
00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:55.559
So there's a huge leveling
up in the toolkit we have.

63
00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:00.153
As again, I was sort of
commenting there about OpenAI,

64
00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:06.138
what everyone thinks, as Sam Altman
said in an essay he wrote recently.

65
00:04:06.138 --> 00:04:12.292
We got lucky to have discovered
the algorithm, the model, the converter,

66
00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:17.488
that somehow, better than we
ever perhaps imagined possible,

67
00:04:17.488 --> 00:04:22.707
captures vastly complex,
underlying distributions of data.

68
00:04:22.707 --> 00:04:24.503
That's patterns of data.

69
00:04:24.503 --> 00:04:30.034
The pattern here might be what numbers and
where are typically associated with

70
00:04:30.034 --> 00:04:35.246
not smile, what numbers and
where are typically associated with smile.

71
00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:40.245
The underlying patterns in data,
we found an algorithm, a model,

72
00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:45.244
a set of instructions that is better
than we could ever have imagined

73
00:04:45.244 --> 00:04:49.120
at identifying those patterns and
distributions.

74
00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.882
And that is the neural networks,
and particularly, transformers.

75
00:04:52.882 --> 00:04:55.098
And that is quite extraordinary.

76
00:04:55.098 --> 00:04:58.952
So, how does it work?

77
00:04:58.952 --> 00:05:00.284
Here it is.

78
00:05:00.284 --> 00:05:03.207
It's probably gonna be best for
us to just give it a go.

79
00:05:03.207 --> 00:05:08.023
Convert pixels, 12,
how many pixels are here, Kayla?

80
00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:10.289
&gt;&gt; Kayla: 12.

81
00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.656
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yep, into output label,
what are our options here, Ben?

82
00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:17.514
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1 or a -1.

83
00:05:17.514 --> 00:05:20.293
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Spot on.

84
00:05:20.293 --> 00:05:24.373
Multiply each pixel number
by a different number.

85
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.479
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: By a different number.

86
00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.253
Multiply each pixel by a different number.

87
00:05:32.253 --> 00:05:36.107
So we will go,
this one by whatever this number is.

88
00:05:36.107 --> 00:05:37.471
This one by whatever this number is.

89
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:38.900
This one by whatever this number is.

90
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.832
This one by whatever this number is.

91
00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:43.484
But every number, and
then add up the total.

92
00:05:43.484 --> 00:05:47.548
So multiply by a a grid of numbers and
add up the total.

93
00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:54.662
Compare the total to the actual target
output label value, Smile 1 or -1.

94
00:05:54.662 --> 00:06:00.842
Adjust the numbers we multiply by until
the group of pixels labeled Smile 1,

95
00:06:00.842 --> 00:06:04.550
the multiplied pixels add up to number 1,
and

96
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.508
the ones labeled -1,
the multiplied pixels add up to -1.

97
00:06:09.508 --> 00:06:12.642
And that gives us a grid of multipliers.

98
00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:14.731
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: That's gonna be it.

99
00:06:14.731 --> 00:06:17.381
[LAUGH] That is it, we're gonna see.

100
00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:18.143
That is it.

101
00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:23.243
So we have our, as before, target output.

102
00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:24.870
There we go.

103
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.674
Now we have our

104
00:06:28.674 --> 00:06:34.067
converted output.

105
00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:38.923
All right, Joe, target output for
our first set of 12 pixels,

106
00:06:38.923 --> 00:06:41.938
1s and 0s, the target output is what?

107
00:06:41.938 --> 00:06:42.482
&gt;&gt; Joe: 1.

108
00:06:42.482 --> 00:06:44.777
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, spot on, Joe,
target output, the other one?

109
00:06:44.777 --> 00:06:45.670
&gt;&gt; Joe: -1.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1,

110
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.513
I'm still getting used to
the negative 1 versus minus one.

111
00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:51.599
-1, exactly.

112
00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:55.651
We're gonna multiply each pixel by
a different number, and the total, and

113
00:06:55.651 --> 00:06:59.956
then we're gonna compare the total to
the actual output label that was given by,

114
00:06:59.956 --> 00:07:03.586
I don't know, someone working at
Scale AI or just us looking at it.

115
00:07:03.586 --> 00:07:08.473
And then adjust the numbers we multiplied
until the pixels labeled Smile 1,

116
00:07:08.473 --> 00:07:12.682
when multiplied, add up to give 1,
and the pixels labeled -1,

117
00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:15.186
when multiplied, add up to give -1.

118
00:07:15.186 --> 00:07:16.604
I've got a little clue here,

119
00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:20.235
we can ignore the pixels where the numbers
are the same in both of the images,

120
00:07:20.235 --> 00:07:23.957
both the one that's labeled Smile 1 and
the one that's labeled Smile -1.

121
00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:28.362
Because they're not gonna have any effect,
I wanna try and

122
00:07:28.362 --> 00:07:32.073
have the multiplied numbers
add up to 1 and -1.

123
00:07:32.073 --> 00:07:34.284
So if the numbers are the same in these,

124
00:07:34.284 --> 00:07:37.376
it's not gonna have any effect
what we multiply it by.

125
00:07:37.376 --> 00:07:42.552
So we might as well just
have those multiplied by 0.

126
00:07:42.552 --> 00:07:45.000
So let's do it.

127
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.773
We've got our multipliers, here they are.

128
00:07:49.773 --> 00:07:54.404
If we know that for 1 0 1, is that the
same in the top row of the both images?

129
00:07:54.404 --> 00:07:55.845
Ben, are they the same?

130
00:07:55.845 --> 00:07:57.175
Yeah, next row?

131
00:07:57.175 --> 00:07:59.537
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yes, next row?

132
00:07:59.537 --> 00:08:00.080
Not quite.

133
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.877
We got the, these ones are the same.

134
00:08:02.877 --> 00:08:06.476
So let's put zeros wherever it's the same.

135
00:08:06.476 --> 00:08:09.722
So 0, 0, Ben, what's next?

136
00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:10.598
&gt;&gt; Ben: 0
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0

137
00:08:10.598 --> 00:08:11.098
&gt;&gt; Ben: 0

138
00:08:11.098 --> 00:08:11.598
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0

139
00:08:11.598 --> 00:08:12.098
&gt;&gt; Ben: 0.

140
00:08:12.098 --> 00:08:13.335
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Everyone together.

141
00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:15.168
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 0, 0, 0-

142
00:08:15.168 --> 00:08:16.860
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: I wanna hear everybody.

143
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.702
&gt;&gt; Ben: 0,

144
00:08:18.702 --> 00:08:20.824
1-
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No,

145
00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:25.004
[LAUGH] that's also not gonna be, so
we don't know this one yet, do we?

146
00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.337
We don't know this one yet

147
00:08:26.337 --> 00:08:29.619
because we need to work out what
these multipliers are gonna be.

148
00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:33.164
We know confidently that if the pixels

149
00:08:33.164 --> 00:08:38.261
are exactly the same,
there's no difference between

150
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:42.689
the pixels but for
a label of an image Smile 1 and

151
00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:47.614
-1, then we can just put 0.
So 0 here, what about this one here,

152
00:08:47.614 --> 00:08:48.852
everybody?
&gt;&gt; Ben: 0.

153
00:08:48.852 --> 00:08:50.056
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, what about this one

154
00:08:50.056 --> 00:08:51.232
here, Kayla?
&gt;&gt; Kayla: 0.

155
00:08:51.232 --> 00:08:52.461
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, but

156
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:54.906
these are different.

157
00:08:54.906 --> 00:08:59.125
Okay, so we won't put 0 on those.

158
00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:02.215
Our goal,
multiply all these numbers by all these,

159
00:09:02.215 --> 00:09:04.682
multiply all these numbers by all these.

160
00:09:04.682 --> 00:09:11.575
So we're gonna multiply all these
numbers by my little grid of numbers,

161
00:09:11.575 --> 00:09:15.757
and then all of these
by my same little grid.

162
00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:21.016
I'm just, [LAUGH] these numbers,
there they are.

163
00:09:21.016 --> 00:09:26.616
And then I'm going to
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Add them up.

164
00:09:26.616 --> 00:09:29.333
So let's go.

165
00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:33.086
Maria, 1 multiplied by 0 equals what?

166
00:09:33.086 --> 00:09:34.231
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

167
00:09:34.231 --> 00:09:37.795
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Excellent, Maria, you
got us started, you keep us going, 0 by 0?

168
00:09:37.795 --> 00:09:39.068
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

169
00:09:39.068 --> 00:09:39.883
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1 by 0?

170
00:09:39.883 --> 00:09:42.244
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

171
00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:43.094
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0 by 0?

172
00:09:43.094 --> 00:09:47.082
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0, 0, 0.

173
00:09:47.082 --> 00:09:48.091
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1 by 0?

174
00:09:48.091 --> 00:09:49.452
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

175
00:09:49.452 --> 00:09:51.572
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: We don't know
this one yet, we'll hold on it.

176
00:09:51.572 --> 00:09:52.867
1 by 0, Maria?

177
00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:54.947
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

178
00:09:54.947 --> 00:09:55.768
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1 by 0?

179
00:09:55.768 --> 00:09:57.382
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

180
00:09:57.382 --> 00:09:59.453
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: We don't
know the next one, 1 by 0?

181
00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:00.131
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

182
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:01.592
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And
it all sums up to what?

183
00:10:01.592 --> 00:10:02.283
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

184
00:10:02.283 --> 00:10:07.470
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, okay,
let's make sure we're tracking

185
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.928
as before how accurate is
our set of multipliers

186
00:10:12.928 --> 00:10:17.295
converting our pixels to our output,

187
00:10:17.295 --> 00:10:21.396
Smile 1 or Smile -1, is 0, 1.

188
00:10:21.396 --> 00:10:24.999
&gt;&gt; Maria: No.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No, no, so out of two so

189
00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:27.799
far, not accurate.

190
00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:34.717
Let's give Maria a hand for saying zero so
many times without stopping me.

191
00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:41.957
All right, let's get converting our next
image's pixels with our multipliers.

192
00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:44.061
Who's gonna be the lucky person?

193
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:47.073
Jamie, you're up, 1 by 0?

194
00:10:47.073 --> 00:10:51.269
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 0 0 0, 0 0 0.

195
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:53.698
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 0, unknown, 0.

196
00:10:53.698 --> 00:10:55.183
0, unknown, 0.

197
00:10:55.183 --> 00:10:56.908
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Beautiful, comes to?

198
00:10:56.908 --> 00:10:57.673
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 0.

199
00:10:57.673 --> 00:10:59.413
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Is 0 equal to -1?

200
00:10:59.413 --> 00:11:02.844
We want this converter, this model,

201
00:11:02.844 --> 00:11:07.671
to successfully convert our
pixels into this label so

202
00:11:07.671 --> 00:11:12.712
that we know that if the population
mirrors the sample of

203
00:11:12.712 --> 00:11:17.661
what makes a smile 1 and
what makes a smile -1, not.

204
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:23.761
Then we can apply that same converter
to convert these pixels into 1 or -1.

205
00:11:26.337 --> 00:11:27.948
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: How's it doing so
far, Jamie?

206
00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:30.036
Is 0 equal to -1?

207
00:11:30.036 --> 00:11:31.634
It's definitely not.

208
00:11:31.634 --> 00:11:33.388
So what's our accuracy?

209
00:11:33.388 --> 00:11:33.915
&gt;&gt; Jamie: 0.

210
00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:38.204
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0 out of 2, okay.

211
00:11:38.204 --> 00:11:41.837
Raise your hand if you can already spot
what our multipliers need to be here

212
00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:43.196
to get it to fully convert?

213
00:11:43.196 --> 00:11:47.057
Well, good, I will say this,
it's not easy, because you gotta kinda,

214
00:11:47.057 --> 00:11:48.318
it's a little puzzle.

215
00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:49.230
Well, let's try and do it.

216
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.953
We know that this one here,
we want it to be what, Ben?

217
00:11:52.953 --> 00:11:54.567
We want this to sum to what?

218
00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:55.097
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1.

219
00:11:55.097 --> 00:11:56.423
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, cuz if it does,

220
00:11:56.423 --> 00:12:00.794
then we've successfully converted
these pixels into number 1.

221
00:12:00.794 --> 00:12:02.758
And we want this one, Ben, to sum to what?

222
00:12:02.758 --> 00:12:03.293
&gt;&gt; Ben: -1.

223
00:12:03.293 --> 00:12:07.511
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1, if you want this one
to sum to 1, Ben, we know that we've got

224
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:12.191
a 0 here, so what's this only ever
gonna be this value, the multiplier?

225
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:13.380
&gt;&gt; Ben: There will only ever be 0.

226
00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.690
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, whenever we
have as a multiplier for it, what's,

227
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:18.253
it multiplied by 0, Ben?

228
00:12:18.253 --> 00:12:24.825
0, 1, if we want this to 1, what do we
need our multiplied pixel to be here?

229
00:12:24.825 --> 00:12:25.458
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1.

230
00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:27.293
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, beautiful.

231
00:12:27.293 --> 00:12:33.552
Which means our multiplier
is going to need to be what?

232
00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:35.167
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, and we might be like,

233
00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:36.845
is that gonna break the other one?

234
00:12:36.845 --> 00:12:38.366
Why is it not gonna break the other one,
Ben?

235
00:12:38.366 --> 00:12:39.208
&gt;&gt; Ben: Because the value is 0.

236
00:12:39.208 --> 00:12:43.574
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Multiplied by 0,
it's not gonna matter either.

237
00:12:43.574 --> 00:12:45.923
Some of all this now is what, Ben?

238
00:12:45.923 --> 00:12:47.314
&gt;&gt; Ben: 1.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, does that equal our

239
00:12:47.314 --> 00:12:48.681
total our target output?

240
00:12:48.681 --> 00:12:54.057
It does, yay, yay!

241
00:12:54.057 --> 00:12:55.388
What's our accuracy now, Ben?

242
00:12:55.388 --> 00:12:56.624
&gt;&gt; Ben: Half.

243
00:12:56.624 --> 00:12:59.592
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Half, fine, 1,
exactly, 1 out of 2, beautiful.

244
00:12:59.592 --> 00:13:07.435
Okay, the converter's getting better,
people.

245
00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:08.911
Okay fine, yay!

246
00:13:08.911 --> 00:13:09.642
Well done Ben!

247
00:13:09.642 --> 00:13:10.368
Well done Ben!

248
00:13:10.368 --> 00:13:11.629
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Convert's getting

249
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:12.169
better.

250
00:13:12.169 --> 00:13:16.517
Now, a bit harder, let's have Paul.

251
00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:21.910
Paul, we want this one to sum to -1, what
are we gonna need the value here to be?

252
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.384
The multiplied pixel up
here on this set of pixels.

253
00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:28.573
&gt;&gt; Paul: -1.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1, spot on.

254
00:13:28.573 --> 00:13:32.436
What's that implied for
our multiplier there, Paul?

255
00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:33.140
&gt;&gt; Paul: The same.

256
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.651
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: The same,
it's gonna need to be -1,

257
00:13:37.651 --> 00:13:41.769
1 multiplied by -1 equals -1.

258
00:13:41.769 --> 00:13:43.329
So, Kayla, what's our sum now for

259
00:13:43.329 --> 00:13:45.723
this set of multiplied pixels,
for the second image?

260
00:13:45.723 --> 00:13:46.333
&gt;&gt; Kayla: -1.

261
00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:48.559
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1, amazing.

262
00:13:48.559 --> 00:13:52.719
Is -1, Kayla, equal to -1?

263
00:13:52.719 --> 00:13:54.323
You bet it is.

264
00:13:54.323 --> 00:13:59.898
Have we successfully converted this set of
12 pixels into our target of -1, Kayla?

265
00:13:59.898 --> 00:14:02.265
&gt;&gt; Kayla: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: You bet, we have.

266
00:14:02.265 --> 00:14:03.695
What's our accuracy, Kayla?

267
00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:04.748
&gt;&gt; Kayla: 2 out of 2.

268
00:14:04.748 --> 00:14:08.110
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: How do I maintain
this enthusiasm about this basic math?

269
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.180
[LAUGH] Do we get 2 out of 2?

270
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.480
You bet we did, exactly,
a woot is in order.

271
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.778
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Well done, well done,

272
00:14:16.778 --> 00:14:19.016
well done, well done.

273
00:14:19.016 --> 00:14:21.667
We have successfully produced
a set of multipliers now.

274
00:14:21.667 --> 00:14:26.884
Ben, you were saying you probably spotted
it was -1 and 1 immediately, right?

275
00:14:26.884 --> 00:14:27.436
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah,

276
00:14:27.436 --> 00:14:30.907
there's a little puzzle, but it's like,
here's the thing, we'll see in a moment.

277
00:14:30.907 --> 00:14:34.106
Hooray, what on Ben,
while on all of us, but

278
00:14:34.106 --> 00:14:38.907
I'm gonna be pretty sure that if we
have to have more multipliers and

279
00:14:38.907 --> 00:14:44.152
anything more than two sample images
is gonna be pretty damn impossible.

280
00:14:44.152 --> 00:14:45.768
Even harder than a decision tree.

281
00:14:45.768 --> 00:14:48.708
Good, well, we'll see what these
numbers might mean in a second, but

282
00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:50.284
it's a lot more obscure, isn't it?

283
00:14:50.284 --> 00:14:54.113
So we multiplied each pixel
by a different number.

284
00:14:54.113 --> 00:14:57.665
We then added up the total,
I should have written, sum.

285
00:14:57.665 --> 00:15:00.164
What's our favorite symbol for all?

286
00:15:00.164 --> 00:15:02.771
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Upside down A.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Upside down A, sum all.

287
00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:07.344
And then compare the total to
the actual output label value, 1 or -1.

288
00:15:07.344 --> 00:15:10.504
The actual being labeled
by a person in the sample,

289
00:15:10.504 --> 00:15:12.720
by Scale AI or someone, like that.

290
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.677
Adjusting the numbers, we multiply each
pixel by, we kind of implicitly had 0 and

291
00:15:16.677 --> 00:15:17.762
0 here, didn't we?

292
00:15:17.762 --> 00:15:20.986
If it was adding to 0,
we had kind of implicitly, 0 and 0.

293
00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:27.108
We then adjusted to 1 and -1 to ensure
that the pixels labeled Smile 1,

294
00:15:27.108 --> 00:15:31.554
those 12,
when multiplied by those multipliers,

295
00:15:31.554 --> 00:15:35.728
added up, gave a total of 1,
matching Smile 1.

296
00:15:35.728 --> 00:15:39.634
And the pixels labeled -1,
when multiplied,

297
00:15:39.634 --> 00:15:43.736
these pixels, and add it up,
gave a total of -1.

298
00:15:43.736 --> 00:15:47.578
Meaning we can now,
give us a grid of multipliers.

299
00:15:47.578 --> 00:15:50.963
What's a grid of numbers called,
people, in math?

300
00:15:50.963 --> 00:15:53.986
&gt;&gt; Ben: Matrix.
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Matrix, exactly.

301
00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:58.458
Matrix, what's it called when
we multiply matrices together?

302
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:02.039
We were multiplying a grid of numbers by
another, what's that type of math called?

303
00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:02.663
&gt;&gt; Paul: Linear algebra.

304
00:16:02.663 --> 00:16:04.619
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Linear algebra,
that's the one from Paul.

305
00:16:04.619 --> 00:16:05.979
Linear algebra.

306
00:16:05.979 --> 00:16:10.978
It's the math of the rules
associated with multiplying grids

307
00:16:10.978 --> 00:16:14.062
of numbers by other grids of numbers.

308
00:16:14.062 --> 00:16:17.341
Things like,
they better be the same dimension,

309
00:16:17.341 --> 00:16:20.554
I can't multiply a 4 by4
grid by a 3 by 4 grid.

310
00:16:20.554 --> 00:16:25.479
And there are lots of effective
ways to multiply matrices.

311
00:16:25.479 --> 00:16:27.518
It's at the core of neural networks.

312
00:16:27.518 --> 00:16:32.106
It's why, actually,
some of the chip design for,

313
00:16:32.106 --> 00:16:37.322
as we'll see in a moment,
working out the best multipliers

314
00:16:37.322 --> 00:16:42.332
are designed specifically to
be perfectly optimized for

315
00:16:42.332 --> 00:16:45.596
handling matrix multiplications.

316
00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:50.655
Because at the core of, we'll see
training, a, whatever this is in a second,

317
00:16:50.655 --> 00:16:55.125
we'll say, this model is matrix
multiplication or linear algebra.
