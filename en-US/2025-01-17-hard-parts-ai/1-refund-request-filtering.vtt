1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So in this workshop,
we'll build out the full mental models of

2
00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:08.573
prediction, model development, deployment,
so that you can be part of it.

3
00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:13.885
But folk, it all starts with
predicting whether our DoorDash

4
00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:18.992
refund request is legit or not,
so that we can automate that

5
00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:25.039
decision rather than back and
forth chat with a customer service rep.

6
00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.492
You've seen this maybe in your DoorDash or
in your Upwork, no, well,

7
00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:30.058
[LAUGH] that's my favorite app.

8
00:00:30.058 --> 00:00:35.102
Your DoorDash or your Uber Eats,
where you can no longer go and

9
00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:39.467
have a chat with a customer
service rep and say, hey,

10
00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:42.779
my food did not show, can I get a refund?

11
00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:49.163
But instead you can say my food did not
show and automatically you get a refund.

12
00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:52.590
They ain't giving that to everybody,
there's something about

13
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.840
the characteristics of your
request that's enabling that.

14
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.755
How is that automation happening?

15
00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.820
To automate that decision rather
than back and forth chat, how?

16
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.334
By using a sample.

17
00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:10.779
Now folk, [LAUGH] it wouldn't be [LAUGH]
a workshop without whiteboarding so

18
00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:14.796
here we are back on our blackboard here,

19
00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:19.994
back to our familiar blackboard,
and we are going to

20
00:01:19.994 --> 00:01:25.216
get building a sample of
historic refund requests.

21
00:01:25.216 --> 00:01:33.266
So that is previous refund requests made
that are gonna each have two sets of data.

22
00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:36.604
One, a bunch of background
info on each request.

23
00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:38.807
What sort of things might that be?

24
00:01:38.807 --> 00:01:44.081
We're gonna see a bunch, some sort
of details about the request, maybe,

25
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:49.622
Kayla give me one right now, detail on
the request that might be interesting.

26
00:01:49.622 --> 00:01:51.418
How many dollars?

27
00:01:51.418 --> 00:01:54.679
Excellent from Kayla, exactly.

28
00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.465
The background info on
the refund request and

29
00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:02.450
an associated data set,
absolutely crucial,

30
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.435
the decision from the customer service rep
whether or not to have given the refund.

31
00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:14.138
That's gonna be our historic data,
that's gonna be our sample.

32
00:02:14.138 --> 00:02:17.869
Let's see, let's start here,
folks, here we go.

33
00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:21.788
We're gonna have a sample, yay.

34
00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:27.591
Of some refund requests, some historic,

35
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:32.910
refund requests that are themselves,

36
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.691
a subset that means some of,
a total population.

37
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:44.535
Population doesn't mean people, it means
all possible of this type of thing,

38
00:02:44.535 --> 00:02:46.571
in this case, refund requests.

39
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:51.704
Population of, this is one of only
two fancy symbols we're gonna have

40
00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:56.750
in all of this otherwise very math
heavy domain of machine learning,

41
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.936
and that is the upside down A.

42
00:02:58.936 --> 00:03:02.170
Raise your hand if you've
seen this symbol before.

43
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.203
Hey, it just means all.

44
00:03:04.203 --> 00:03:07.810
So [LAUGH] it's just a shorthand for
all, but

45
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.234
start using this in your slack messages.

46
00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:16.395
That's right, hi, all,
people are gonna love you for that.

47
00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:19.430
You're gonna love the person
who uses that symbol.

48
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.118
You'll be so popular, you will say,

49
00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:26.410
wow, down to earth,
what a down to earth member of our team.

50
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.976
All possible refund requests,

51
00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:35.546
including future ones, okay?

52
00:03:35.546 --> 00:03:41.993
In our sample though, because that's gonna
hopefully provide us the background,

53
00:03:41.993 --> 00:03:47.712
the material to maybe predict or
generalize to the rest of our population,

54
00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:50.553
including future refund requests.

55
00:03:50.553 --> 00:03:52.494
But we have to start with a sample.

56
00:03:52.494 --> 00:03:55.195
So who should we start with?

57
00:03:55.195 --> 00:03:56.309
We will start with.

58
00:03:59.018 --> 00:04:00.165
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: I don't
know who I can get.

59
00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:02.169
Ben, here we go, Ben.

60
00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.696
Ben, when did you do your refund request?

61
00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:06.421
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yesterday.

62
00:04:06.421 --> 00:04:10.523
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay,
November 24th, great.

63
00:04:10.523 --> 00:04:14.284
And we know Ben is a very good,

64
00:04:14.284 --> 00:04:20.524
noble DoorDash user, so
did Ben get a refund?

65
00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:21.814
You bet Ben did.

66
00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:26.362
Absolutely, Ben got a refund,
we'll say, yes, one.

67
00:04:26.362 --> 00:04:32.418
I feel bad [LAUGH] now, [LAUGH] given
that I've- Okay, what about Joe?

68
00:04:32.418 --> 00:04:34.962
What do we think of Joe?

69
00:04:34.962 --> 00:04:39.871
Joe's great, but, Joe,
when did you make your refund request?

70
00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:42.409
&gt;&gt; Joe: November 28th.

71
00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.979
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No, this is 2024, sorry,
November 28, is that in the future.

72
00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:47.872
&gt;&gt; Joe: November 18.

73
00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:48.893
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: That's in the future.

74
00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:53.610
[LAUGH Okay, so, Joe made their
refund request in october 24,

75
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.527
there we go, that'll do.

76
00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:59.002
And Joe, what do they call this month?

77
00:04:59.002 --> 00:05:01.790
They call this the month of fraud.

78
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.924
Joe [LAUGH].

79
00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:06.204
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: DoorDash has your face

80
00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:10.208
on that- you know where they print
out your face at the Bodega?

81
00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:11.689
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Joe: Yeah.

82
00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.680
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: DoorDash has,
so Joe, did you get a refund?

83
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.383
&gt;&gt; Joe: No, I did not.

84
00:05:17.383 --> 00:05:22.653
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Not a chance,
[LAUGH] -1, no refund,

85
00:05:22.653 --> 00:05:26.338
absolutely, there we go.

86
00:05:26.338 --> 00:05:29.735
Ben, refund, yes, Joe, refund, no.

87
00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:36.672
This is our sample of all
possible refund requests.

88
00:05:36.672 --> 00:05:41.869
In reality,
maybe we have 100,000 in our sample,

89
00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:44.633
but for now, just Ben and Joe.

90
00:05:44.633 --> 00:05:48.341
Here's the goal, if we can figure out,

91
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:53.251
there's a bunch of background
information on Ben's

92
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:58.160
refund request,
the size of the refund request, but

93
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.069
maybe even thousands of
different pieces of detail,

94
00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:08.414
pieces of data, thousands of it,
I'll do a little symbol

95
00:06:08.414 --> 00:06:13.133
of the database,
they got a whole database on Ben.

96
00:06:13.133 --> 00:06:17.365
Joe, [LAUGH] they got
a whole database on Joe.

97
00:06:17.365 --> 00:06:21.504
There's all the background
info on Joe's refund request.

98
00:06:21.504 --> 00:06:26.589
If we can work out some rules,
some instructions,

99
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:31.084
some boundaries, maybe maximums or min-,

100
00:06:31.084 --> 00:06:35.580
some way of converting
the background info on

101
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.431
Ben's refund request to
the decision refund one

102
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:45.162
on that historic refund from Ben,
and Joe's,

103
00:06:45.162 --> 00:06:50.487
the background Joe's refund
request to the decision

104
00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:55.690
refund minus one,
no refund if we can work that out,

105
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.936
we can potentially create
some sort of set of rules.

106
00:07:00.936 --> 00:07:04.429
Some way to convert,
let's call it a converter,

107
00:07:04.429 --> 00:07:09.851
which I know can be spelled with an Or,
I checked, with an OR or an [LAUGH].

108
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:14.163
Some sort of converter,
then we can potentially use

109
00:07:14.163 --> 00:07:19.161
that converter on the rest of
the population, meaning, and

110
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:23.963
by population, I don't mean people,
though, per say,

111
00:07:23.963 --> 00:07:28.767
in the way it is here, but
the rest of the refund requests.

112
00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:34.104
Meaning that when Paul in December of 24,

113
00:07:34.104 --> 00:07:39.154
we're talking next month, the future,

114
00:07:39.154 --> 00:07:44.637
makes a refund request,
we have a whole bunch

115
00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:51.275
of background info on Paul and
their refund request and

116
00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:56.181
we can potentially use that converter to

117
00:07:56.181 --> 00:08:01.695
automate the decision
to make a prediction.

118
00:08:01.695 --> 00:08:06.306
If the sample is representative,
has the same sort of patterns in it,

119
00:08:06.306 --> 00:08:09.982
of what is associated with
a refund in background data,

120
00:08:09.982 --> 00:08:14.833
what's associated with we shouldn't
give a refund in background data,

121
00:08:14.833 --> 00:08:19.994
if we can find those patterns and apply
them also to convert the background data

122
00:08:19.994 --> 00:08:25.264
on Paul to a decision of what would it be,
what would be the decision here Kayla?

123
00:08:25.264 --> 00:08:28.508
We got a refund of what
two choices do we have?

124
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:29.490
&gt;&gt; Kayla: One or negative one.

125
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.542
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: One or negative one,
right, yes or no, then perhaps we can

126
00:08:34.542 --> 00:08:39.695
make a prediction of one or
negative one, that is to say yes or

127
00:08:39.695 --> 00:08:45.174
no on giving the refund to Paul,
and we can do it automatically.

128
00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:49.434
No customer service rep required.

129
00:08:49.434 --> 00:08:52.404
People, that is it, that is it.

130
00:08:52.404 --> 00:08:57.132
If we can work out a way, a set of rules,
instructions to convert the info on

131
00:08:57.132 --> 00:09:01.954
each of the requests into yes or no,
one or minus one, that we have, right?

132
00:09:01.954 --> 00:09:04.430
We've got two parallel data sets here,
a bunch of info on Ben,

133
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:05.332
a bunch of info on Joe.

134
00:09:05.332 --> 00:09:10.024
And in parallel,
sort of corollary data sets, contiguous,

135
00:09:10.024 --> 00:09:15.542
I don't know what these words mean,
[LAUGH] I think I know what they mean.

136
00:09:15.542 --> 00:09:20.372
Refund, one, refund, minus one, what
the customer service rep gave, then for

137
00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:25.342
our population, all possible, including
future refund requests, as long as that

138
00:09:25.342 --> 00:09:29.822
sample mirrors the population, as long
as that sample is representative of

139
00:09:29.822 --> 00:09:34.302
the population of all future refund
requests, the associated data of Ben,

140
00:09:34.302 --> 00:09:38.152
typically with a refund one, Joe,
typically with a minus one and

141
00:09:38.152 --> 00:09:43.192
100,000 of those, maybe then for Paul,
we can apply that same conversion and

142
00:09:43.192 --> 00:09:46.701
make a prediction,
the right decision, one or minus one.

143
00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:48.631
Maria, then I'm gonna come to you,

144
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:51.260
what info on each request
might actually matter?

145
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.350
And I realize I'm a spit
squished down here,

146
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.275
but I'm gonna put a few of them down here.

147
00:09:55.275 --> 00:09:58.748
&gt;&gt; Maria: So the name of the person, the-
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, and

148
00:09:58.748 --> 00:10:04.093
I don't know if we should be inferring
too much from name, but we could.

149
00:10:04.093 --> 00:10:06.293
&gt;&gt; Maria: To pick up the background data,
right?

150
00:10:06.293 --> 00:10:09.506
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, absolutely, yes.

151
00:10:09.506 --> 00:10:12.549
I thought, what things might be
important to determine whether or

152
00:10:12.549 --> 00:10:16.459
not to give a refund, the name might allow
us to find all the background information,

153
00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:17.130
definitely.

154
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:21.311
I don't know if we want to use
the name to make our prediction.

155
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:24.911
Those Marias, don't get me started.

156
00:10:24.911 --> 00:10:29.575
Let's put this then,
I think for now, here.

157
00:10:29.575 --> 00:10:32.082
So we have,
let's put it in because it's good to

158
00:10:32.082 --> 00:10:34.836
know that this could be
something we could consider,

159
00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:38.585
let's have name, What other things
about the request might be useful?

160
00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:42.978
I understand Maria's- yeah,
absolutely, date of the request.

161
00:10:42.978 --> 00:10:45.002
What other things?

162
00:10:45.002 --> 00:10:45.599
&gt;&gt; Maria: Amount.

163
00:10:45.599 --> 00:10:50.284
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Amount, absolutely, that
feels more fair than name, [LAUGH] but

164
00:10:50.284 --> 00:10:55.393
I understand absolutely that Maria
was suggesting name, as in to go and

165
00:10:55.393 --> 00:11:01.377
get the information on their profile,
absolutely, yeah, anyway, excellent.

166
00:11:01.377 --> 00:11:04.671
Really good stuff from Maria there,
any more you wanna add?

167
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:06.505
&gt;&gt; Maria: Maybe items.

168
00:11:06.505 --> 00:11:09.008
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, absolutely,
maybe the types of items.

169
00:11:09.008 --> 00:11:12.250
Yeah, actually that's a really good one.

170
00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:15.384
I've not heard that one before, and
that's a spot on one, isn't it?

171
00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:19.621
Types of items, excellent from Maria,
let's have, yeah, please Joe.

172
00:11:19.621 --> 00:11:22.001
&gt;&gt; Joe: What about description
of the refund request?

173
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:23.473
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, exactly,

174
00:11:23.473 --> 00:11:27.897
the text string of the refund
request spot on, yeah.

175
00:11:27.897 --> 00:11:28.659
Nick, sorry Nick.

176
00:11:28.659 --> 00:11:30.217
&gt;&gt; Nick: Frequency of refunds, like-
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yes,

177
00:11:30.217 --> 00:11:34.893
absolutely frequency of refunds,
yes absolutely, Ben?

178
00:11:34.893 --> 00:11:37.613
&gt;&gt; Ben: And
if he has any historical refund?

179
00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:41.693
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Historical refund, maybe
historical spend, absolute daily spend,

180
00:11:41.693 --> 00:11:42.987
yeah, please Jamie.

181
00:11:42.987 --> 00:11:46.844
&gt;&gt; Jamie: How about time
since the original purchase.

182
00:11:46.844 --> 00:11:52.154
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: People who've
actually worked in fraud detection,

183
00:11:52.154 --> 00:11:57.936
always bring this one,
I'm not saying maybe Jamie has but

184
00:11:57.936 --> 00:12:05.606
that is absolutely such a great predictor
that doesn't always come to mind,

185
00:12:05.606 --> 00:12:11.275
which is time since event,
time since it's happening.

186
00:12:11.275 --> 00:12:14.517
Other things, Kayla,
anyone's come to mind?

187
00:12:14.517 --> 00:12:15.775
&gt;&gt; Kayla: Which restaurant?

188
00:12:15.775 --> 00:12:18.459
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah,
maybe delivery driver, so yeah,

189
00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:20.230
these are all really good.

190
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.990
Yeah, these are all really good people.

191
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.850
There's so many great options on there.

192
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:26.748
What else we got?

193
00:12:26.748 --> 00:12:30.588
We got amount, account length,
how long you've been a member, right?

194
00:12:30.588 --> 00:12:34.957
How long you've used, so
let's say account length.

195
00:12:34.957 --> 00:12:38.776
I always got another one in mind actually,
so I could be in years perhaps.

196
00:12:38.776 --> 00:12:46.791
I always got another one in mind which is
number of accounts on that given IP, okay?

197
00:12:46.791 --> 00:12:50.025
Accounts on IP, let's see, accounts on IP.

198
00:12:50.025 --> 00:12:57.406
If you're trying to vote manipulate on,
if any of you have tried that,

199
00:12:57.406 --> 00:13:03.433
[LAUGH] if any of you are trying
to boost any of your content,

200
00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:08.986
you'll know that's a key
one that gets you spotted.
