00:00:00.058 --> 00:00:04.078
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, question was,
any learning materials that I recommend?

2
00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:09.068
Well, of course, I have to say,
if you want to explore one of the most

3
00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:14.060
interesting parts of deep learning,
deep learning being, lots and

4
00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.817
lots of layers of weights,
neural networks with lots of layers.

5
00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:20.913
But in extension, machine learning.

6
00:00:20.913 --> 00:00:25.378
And particularly a groundbreaking part
of it that's used a lot in things like

7
00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:27.448
autonomous vehicle development.

8
00:00:27.448 --> 00:00:29.416
And as I say,
if you haven't been in a Waymo yet,

9
00:00:29.416 --> 00:00:31.148
raise your hand if you've been in a Waymo.

10
00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:33.620
Yeah, it's great fun.

11
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.969
And after two rides with no driver,
you get very used to it.

12
00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.894
But initially, anyway,
that uses a technique,

13
00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:46.130
deep reinforcement learning,
that is, actually there's a book

14
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.095
on it by the co-founder of Codesmith,
Alex Zai from Manning.

15
00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:56.087
That of course, I have to recommend,
practical applications of it.

16
00:00:56.087 --> 00:01:00.515
But if you're looking to explore from
more foundational first principles,

17
00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:03.921
it's a very practical application
approach, that book So

18
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:08.641
that's also a serious recommendation,
as a plug for co-founder of Codesmith.

19
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:13.362
But if you're looking instead for
actually, I think, the best tools to build

20
00:01:13.362 --> 00:01:17.510
out the mental models that would
empower you as software engineers,

21
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.031
I always recommend the Grokking series.

22
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.597
I believe, also from Manning,
they are phenomenal.

23
00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:27.806
I absolutely love them,
I'd love to write one myself one day.

24
00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:30.244
They're not all perfect, but

25
00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:35.508
they're about building out mental
models of many of these areas.

26
00:01:35.508 --> 00:01:39.706
I think I read the neural networks
one about seven years ago, and

27
00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:43.671
those mental models still, or
it was the deep learning one,

28
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:47.435
those models still sit with
me with great clarity today.

29
00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:51.114
And so, I absolutely love, they have
one for algorithms, they have one for

30
00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:54.624
machine learning, they have one for
neural networks or deep learning,

31
00:01:54.624 --> 00:01:56.773
I can't remember which one they called it.

32
00:01:56.773 --> 00:02:01.065
But for this, for neural networks,
the one for machine learning,

33
00:02:01.065 --> 00:02:05.811
which is anything from decision trees
to other techniques, regression,

34
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:08.464
gradient boosting, other techniques.

35
00:02:08.464 --> 00:02:10.599
And as I said, they have one for
neural networks.

36
00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.570
I can't remember if it's called
neural networks or deep learning, but

37
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.292
it's a grokking series.

38
00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:18.720
Without a shadow of the doubt,
my favorite set of books.

39
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.392
And also,
always good is 3Blue1Brown on YouTube.

40
00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:27.327
The brilliant Stanford math grad,
or Caltech math grad,

41
00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:32.264
brilliant communicator,
incredible visualizations,

42
00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:39.633
always have complex algorithms, has a lot
of fun visualizations of neural networks.

43
00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:41.895
Definitely more on the math heavy side,

44
00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:46.496
tends to assume you're pretty confident
with calculus and with linear algebra.

45
00:02:46.496 --> 00:02:50.324
Maybe more calculus and
linear algebra, but still,

46
00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:53.397
nevertheless, relatively accessible.

47
00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:55.836
Where to go next with all of this?

48
00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:57.161
Where to go next with all of this?

49
00:02:57.161 --> 00:03:02.282
Get building with code and
now with models.

50
00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:07.249
Prediction, machine learning AI models
in software engineering has changed

51
00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.140
what we can tackle with code.

52
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.076
When I spoke to the Global Head
of AI at a 5,000-person law firm,

53
00:03:14.076 --> 00:03:18.091
their words were,
we will not be hiring as many lawyers,

54
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:22.798
we have a new, lawyers have a very
post-college standard route.

55
00:03:22.798 --> 00:03:25.738
They said,
we have a new version of that for

56
00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:29.754
our technologists, for
our lawyer software engineers.

57
00:03:29.754 --> 00:03:34.651
At Codesmith, we've had multiple people go
off and become legal software engineers.

58
00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:38.080
Where the job description said,
must have JD,

59
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.032
must have done law degree,
and be software engineer.

60
00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:47.002
This is the burgeoning space, whole new
domains where previously you could build

61
00:03:47.002 --> 00:03:51.194
a tool for a law firm, but it was
not gonna be providing legal advice.

62
00:03:51.194 --> 00:03:59.151
Because you couldn't make predictions
about complex data, like human language.

63
00:03:59.151 --> 00:04:01.989
Now you can, it does not mean
it's always gonna be easy,

64
00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.655
and that's why you want the right
leaders doing it, but it's emerging,

65
00:04:05.655 --> 00:04:08.573
health, climate, all these areas,
climate modeling.

66
00:04:08.573 --> 00:04:12.536
Software engineers,
with the help of our collaborators,

67
00:04:12.536 --> 00:04:17.449
data scientists, ML engineers,
are at the heart of turning these models

68
00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.271
into products that actually
solve people's problems.

69
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:24.586
So recognize what makes you
great at building with code.

70
00:04:24.586 --> 00:04:27.813
It's your flexibility and
your underlying capacities.

71
00:04:27.813 --> 00:04:31.756
That means, integrate what in the end,
are these core mental models.

72
00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:38.268
It doesn't go really beyond that core idea
of sample to population via generalization

73
00:04:38.268 --> 00:04:43.546
using model, but the incredible
complexity with it is fascinating.

74
00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:49.168
But remember, we're about to have
a whole bunch of new domains be,

75
00:04:49.168 --> 00:04:53.228
I don't know,
have software enter their core.

76
00:04:53.228 --> 00:04:57.938
That makes you even more important,
where you send to your problem-solving

77
00:04:57.938 --> 00:05:02.437
ability to flexibly figure out how to
get there, whatever the tools are.

78
00:05:02.437 --> 00:05:07.489
And your technical communication, ability
to bring others along with you, including

79
00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:12.347
folk who are suddenly going, shoot, I'm
giving legal advice via a software tool.

80
00:05:12.347 --> 00:05:16.682
This matters that you do this the right
way, especially your flexibility,

81
00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:18.790
because the tools are gonna change.

82
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.782
It may be LangChain this year,
to integrate in production

83
00:05:21.782 --> 00:05:24.964
some of these models, but
it definitely may not be next year.

84
00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:27.018
And that's gonna be the rapid
change of the years ahead.

85
00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:31.193
So remember your edge is your
flexibility to problem-solve and

86
00:05:31.193 --> 00:05:33.524
communicate these complex ideas.

87
00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:36.172
Next steps, investigate the development of

88
00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:40.222
machine learning models as we've
done here from first principles.

89
00:05:40.222 --> 00:05:43.925
Building out a neural network from
scratch, building out decision trees from

90
00:05:43.925 --> 00:05:47.753
scratch, investigating from first
principles of sample and generalization.

91
00:05:47.753 --> 00:05:52.684
That's data exploration, understanding
the nature of it, standardizing it,

92
00:05:52.684 --> 00:05:54.549
and then prototyping models.

93
00:05:54.549 --> 00:05:55.086
And then,

94
00:05:55.086 --> 00:05:59.583
experiment with deploying those models in
production, very engineering-oriented.

95
00:05:59.583 --> 00:06:03.245
And the tools that
are available to scale that and

96
00:06:03.245 --> 00:06:08.079
integrate with your builds in
your engineering careers ahead.

97
00:06:08.079 --> 00:06:11.263
It has been wonderful having you here,
great job everybody.

98
00:06:11.263 --> 00:06:13.646
Thank you, and good night.

99
00:06:13.646 --> 00:06:18.510
