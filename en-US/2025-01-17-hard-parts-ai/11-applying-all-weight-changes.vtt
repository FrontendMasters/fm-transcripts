WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:07.105
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And that tells us our
first, well, let's see what it

2
00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:13.274
says, then make all of those changes up or
down, let's

3
00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:19.736
say step of 1, step of 1, which is what we
did to test it.

4
00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:24.020
Make all those changes at once.

5
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.323
And you might be like, wait, wait, wait,
and then start

6
00:00:26.323 --> 00:00:29.339
again with a new round of independent
weight checks, independent checks.

7
00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.192
So let's make all those changes at once.

8
00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:35.232
And then you might be like, excuse me, how
am I possibly allowed to

9
00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:40.228
do that when I tested the impact of the
direction by resetting everything to zero?

10
00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:43.201
And now I'm gonna do them all at once?

11
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:46.856
That feels like I'm gonna be missing
something.

12
00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:50.471
There's gonna be some interaction, like if
I raise this

13
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:55.685
one without changing the others, that's
very different, surely, isn't it?

14
00:00:55.685 --> 00:01:00.184
To raising this one, lowering this one,
raising this one, how can I

15
00:01:00.184 --> 00:01:05.474
possibly be sure that doing all together,
it's still better to raise this one?

16
00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:06.504
Well, we'll come to it in a second.

17
00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:06.554
[INAUDIBLE]

18
00:01:06.554 --> 00:01:08.667
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Maybe it's not, maybe
it's not.

19
00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:09.688
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: Test it and see.

20
00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:11.124
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Let's have a look.

21
00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:17.678
So, let's update all of our weights, then
the top ones we said didn't change.

22
00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:20.804
Let's update all of our weights with these
directions.

23
00:01:20.804 --> 00:01:24.273
So this one would go from 0 to 1.

24
00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:24.925
What's this one, Nick?

25
00:01:24.925 --> 00:01:25.480
&gt;&gt; Nick: 1.

26
00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.090
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1.

27
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.698
&gt;&gt; Nick: -1.

28
00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:27.441
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1.

29
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:27.996
&gt;&gt; Nick: 1.

30
00:01:27.996 --> 00:01:28.692
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1.

31
00:01:28.692 --> 00:01:29.301
&gt;&gt; Nick: -1.

32
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:29.862
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1.

33
00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:30.285
&gt;&gt; Nick: 1.

34
00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:30.845
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1.

35
00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.266
&gt;&gt; Nick: -1.

36
00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:37.898
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Beautiful, now, our hope
is we have managed to find a technique

37
00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:43.969
that didn't require us trying all possible
combinations of these.

38
00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.696
But instead, just checked each of them
individually to see if it overall improved

39
00:01:49.696 --> 00:01:52.684
the number that we're converting for just

40
00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:55.923
that tweak, leaving all at zero, forget
it.

41
00:01:55.923 --> 00:01:57.888
Change this, get them all back to 0.

42
00:01:57.888 --> 00:01:59.440
Try this one up or down.

43
00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.652
Forget everything else, try this one.

44
00:02:03.652 --> 00:02:05.521
And then we could do it all at once,

45
00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.357
even though that was surely not possible,
because I

46
00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:10.290
know that it was the right move when I

47
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.916
held everything else constant at 0, it
made everything better.

48
00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:20.475
But surely it's not the right move if I'm
also changing a bunch of other stuff.

49
00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:25.918
Let's test this out and see what we get to
as our new sums.

50
00:02:25.918 --> 00:02:29.521
Okay, now, people, we get to do some real
good old arithmetic.

51
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:31.116
And I need some help.

52
00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:33.509
I need some help here, people.

53
00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:35.283
I need some help.

54
00:02:35.283 --> 00:02:40.225
I need some help cuz this is, okay, so
these were our first steps.

55
00:02:40.225 --> 00:02:44.634
So we've done this now, we've used this.

56
00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:48.682
But some of the weighted pixels, the
multipliers applied

57
00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:51.994
to our pixels, the top ones are all 0,
right?

58
00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:53.683
Then this one here, 1 by 1 is?

59
00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:54.306
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: 1.

60
00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:55.717
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0 by -1 is?

61
00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:56.457
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: 0.

62
00:02:56.457 --> 00:02:58.664
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, so what's our running
total right now?

63
00:02:58.664 --> 00:02:59.315
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: 1.

64
00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:01.286
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, plus 1 by 1 is?

65
00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:02.549
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: 2.

66
00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.841
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Right, so our running
total is?

67
00:03:03.841 --> 00:03:03.924
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: 2.

68
00:03:03.924 --> 00:03:04.147
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 2.

69
00:03:04.147 --> 00:03:05.148
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Yes, sir.

70
00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:08.077
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, running total
after the bottom left 1 where it's

71
00:03:08.077 --> 00:03:10.652
-1 by 1 is, so -1, now our running total
is?

72
00:03:10.652 --> 00:03:10.763
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Back to 1.

73
00:03:10.763 --> 00:03:13.293
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, then our running
total is?

74
00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:13.945
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Up to 2.

75
00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:16.401
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 2, and now our running
total is back down to?

76
00:03:16.401 --> 00:03:17.016
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 2: Back to 1.

77
00:03:17.016 --> 00:03:17.670
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 1, amazing.

78
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.195
So our output is 1.

79
00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:22.934
Okay, yep.

80
00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:24.654
Next one, anyone got ahead of this and
worked it out?

81
00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:29.676
We've got three negatives and two
positives, right?

82
00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:30.447
So our total is?

83
00:03:30.447 --> 00:03:31.949
-1, excellent.

84
00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:34.398
-1, does that equal -1?

85
00:03:34.398 --> 00:03:34.862
Yes, and for our next one, we have all of

86
00:03:34.862 --> 00:03:35.750
these accounts, sorry, we're doing, this
was our getting there.

87
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:45.697
I almost wanna delete this.

88
00:03:45.697 --> 00:03:51.160
No, I can leave it there, but these were
the steps we took to get to this.

89
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.280
These were the steps we took, we worked
out which way to go independently for each

90
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.070
of them, and then we're doing it all

91
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.673
together in one go and seeing how many
convert.

92
00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:08.923
So let's take this third smile, or third 3
by 4 pixel image in.

93
00:04:08.923 --> 00:04:12.191
Kayla, what's our total?

94
00:04:12.191 --> 00:04:16.894
We've got two negatives and a positive, so
what's our total?

95
00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:17.687
&gt;&gt; Kayla: One.

96
00:04:17.687 --> 00:04:21.329
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So we've got two
negatives, -1 by 1 is?

97
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.839
&gt;&gt; Kayla: -1.

98
00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:25.181
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: Plus 1 takes us back up
to?

99
00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:25.924
[INAUDIBLE]

100
00:04:25.924 --> 00:04:28.403
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, +1 1 by -1 takes us
to?

101
00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:29.102
&gt;&gt; Kayla: -1.

102
00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:30.598
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1, so our total is?

103
00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:31.297
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: -1.

104
00:04:31.297 --> 00:04:33.325
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: -1, does that equal -1,
Kayla?

105
00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:34.071
&gt;&gt; Kayla: Yep.

106
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:35.942
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: You bet it does.

107
00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:42.888
Okay, so our first round of tweaks,
otherwise known as iteration,

108
00:04:42.888 --> 00:04:49.371
doing of, repeated doing of, iteration of
gradient descent.

109
00:04:49.371 --> 00:04:55.408
We'll see iteration of training, getting
our multipliers to be better.

110
00:04:55.408 --> 00:04:58.263
Our first round is doing bloody well so
far.

111
00:04:58.263 --> 00:05:06.382
3 out of 4, accuracy, but shoot, that's
where it ends.

112
00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:08.086
What's our total here?

113
00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:16.151
All 0s, all 0s, +1 by 1, yeah, the -1s are
all 0s, aren't they?

114
00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:20.082
So we get one, well, anyone tell me what
the output is?

115
00:05:20.082 --> 00:05:20.740
&gt;&gt; Male Speaker 1: 3.

116
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.967
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, Maria, well,
everyone said it, so.

117
00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:25.840
1 by 1, Maria, is?

118
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.018
&gt;&gt; Maria: 1.

119
00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:29.126
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Plus 0 by -1 is still?

120
00:05:29.126 --> 00:05:29.735
&gt;&gt; Maria: 1.

121
00:05:29.735 --> 00:05:31.641
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Plus 1 by 1 is?

122
00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:34.450
&gt;&gt; Maria: 2
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Plus?

123
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.711
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

124
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:36.983
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 0, thank you, plus?

125
00:05:36.983 --> 00:05:38.536
&gt;&gt; Maria: 1, so 3.

126
00:05:38.536 --> 00:05:39.609
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: 3 plus?

127
00:05:39.609 --> 00:05:40.219
&gt;&gt; Maria: 0.

128
00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:41.481
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Beautiful, 3.

129
00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:44.385
Perfect, is 3, Maria, 1.

130
00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:44.944
&gt;&gt; Maria: No.

131
00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:46.540
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: No, it is not.
