WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
We've kind of talked about
different devices folks use.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.395
We've talked about screen readers as
a separate concept, and all the different

3
00:00:08.395 --> 00:00:12.790
things that come with that and
we've talked about accessible HTML.

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.746
Writing either semantic HTML or
how to use ARIA to update it.

5
00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:19.655
And we talked about roles and
state and stuff.

6
00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:23.623
So kind of wanted to get into a little
bit more advanced stuff now where we're

7
00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:27.033
thinking about, okay,
like we know what devices folks use, and

8
00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:29.965
we know what considerations we have for
those devices.

9
00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:34.000
How do we really start thinking about
building great accessible experiences?

10
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.527
So the first section on that is
just all about focus management.

11
00:00:38.527 --> 00:00:41.371
So this comes with a few
things like focus management.

12
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:46.383
And it's kind of highest level is like for
keyboard only users like if I just

13
00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:51.411
start hitting tab on the site, do I
have some idea of where I'm at, right?

14
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:53.918
So like for
example do I have that blue focus ring,

15
00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:57.092
which comes default on links and
buttons and things like that.

16
00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:59.685
Do I have some way of knowing where I am?

17
00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:03.020
So back to the webAIM thing for
to be compliant.

18
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.210
Whenever an element receives focus,
it can't change the page dramatically.

19
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.103
So that's like one thing that I've seen
before is like an unfocused animation or

20
00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:13.600
something like that.

21
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.967
But remember that focus is not just
something you're calling in JavaScript it

22
00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:20.689
also can be called when
a user tabs to an element.

23
00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.766
And when you input information or
interact with a control,

24
00:01:23.766 --> 00:01:25.810
it also doesn't change the page.

25
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.939
So that's like one thing we're looking for
is, we need a visual or

26
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.087
some kind of screen reader safe
indicator that the item has focus.

27
00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:36.472
So HTML has like a dot focus property, and

28
00:01:36.472 --> 00:01:40.302
a lot of focus of all elements come
with a blue ring, which is nice.

29
00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:42.823
But also be careful that
you don't change too much.

30
00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:46.199
You don't want to have like a pop
up only come when focus is hit or

31
00:01:46.199 --> 00:01:47.430
something like that.

32
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.840
Because remember, focus is not just
an APIU call it's also something that

33
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.733
the keyboard will call itself.

34
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:54.442
Does that make sense?

35
00:01:54.442 --> 00:01:57.100
It's kind of how to think about focus,
we need an indicator but

36
00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.408
it needs to not be too big because we got
to remember that people are just gonna be

37
00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:03.037
focusing around on different
things as they digest the page.

38
00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:07.796
Awesome.

39
00:02:07.796 --> 00:02:11.950
So one of my favorite things building
with accessibility is keyboard shortcuts.

40
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.916
So, like learning how to be a dev,
I was like a really big vim user, right.?

41
00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:20.917
And then I started getting really into
like keyboard shortcuts on my Mac and

42
00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:25.170
in Chrome and I download a plugin for
Chrome, it's really fun to me when I don't

43
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.860
have to reach over and
use my mouse or my trackpad.

44
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.745
And keyboard shortcuts going back
to the first lesson we talked

45
00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:36.377
about these devices and
a lot of these assistive technologies,

46
00:02:36.377 --> 00:02:39.819
ultimately result in a lot of
effort per keystroke, right?

47
00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.236
Like if you're using the single switch or
using a head one, each character is just

48
00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:49.050
more effort to type than it would be if
you were using your hands at a keyboard.

49
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.328
So one cool thing that people
do on sites like Twitter and

50
00:02:52.328 --> 00:02:56.740
Facebook is they offer keyboard
shortcuts for so many different actions.

51
00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.233
So if you go to twitter.com, and
you hit the question mark button,

52
00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.962
you'll get this pop up, right?

53
00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:06.317
And this pop up will show you that you can
do just about anything like you can use

54
00:03:06.317 --> 00:03:07.389
J and K to move up and

55
00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:11.550
down in your timeline, you can use
space to go one page down at a time.

56
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.255
You can use period to load in New Tweets.

57
00:03:14.255 --> 00:03:15.741
You can make a New Tweet with N.

58
00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:18.896
You can send it with command enter
is like really, really robots.

59
00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:22.986
You can basically do anything that
you need to do on Twitter with two

60
00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:25.478
keystrokes at most one a lot of the time.

61
00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:26.900
So this can be really fun.

62
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.895
I made a library like a long time ago,
it still works great.

63
00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:36.859
But if you go to my github.com/j coupe,
and then on my main page,

64
00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.630
there's this keyboard shortcut library.

65
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.383
So this is like super generic events
that just will trigger on like J, K and

66
00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:48.308
O question mark,
all these kinds of things.

67
00:03:48.308 --> 00:03:51.860
So if you're looking for a place to
get started, this could be a cool one.

68
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.785
Feel free to use any other
library that's out there.

69
00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:57.818
But this is just one that I made that, he
didn't get to see how old it is cuz it has

70
00:03:57.818 --> 00:04:01.917
Bower for an installation instruction but
you can just take the .js library and

71
00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:04.792
it works great for
kind of like setting up a framework for

72
00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:08.130
keyboard shortcuts if you wanna
build them on your own app.

73
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.371
Facebook has very similar.

74
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:13.499
You're able to move through all
the news items, you're able to search,

75
00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:16.981
you're able to go into a full screen or
not full screen, you're able to go through

76
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:20.220
pictures, all sorts of really cool
things with keyboard shortcuts alone.

77
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.016
So yeah, so I would recommend
like they're fun to build.

78
00:04:25.016 --> 00:04:27.322
They're really helpful for folks.

79
00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:28.618
There's a lot of prior art on them.

80
00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:31.389
So I'd probably if I were building it for
a new app,

81
00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.640
I would just go to one of these sites that
already has them and use a lot of the same

82
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.183
shortcuts that they use cuz I think
folks will come to a new site and

83
00:04:39.183 --> 00:04:42.171
just try J and K, for example,
for next and previous.

84
00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:44.640
But yeah, they're a lot of fun and
they can be really helpful for people.

85
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.026
They're definitely more advanced, right?

86
00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:49.307
This is not just adding
roles to HTML elements.

87
00:04:49.307 --> 00:04:50.834
This would be event listeners for

88
00:04:50.834 --> 00:04:54.168
JavaScript that actually trigger
things in your app when they're hit.

89
00:04:54.168 --> 00:04:57.700
But yeah, they're a lot of fun to
build and they can be really helpful.
