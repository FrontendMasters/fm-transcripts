1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.388
Accessibility is an interesting one
because unlike some of the other subjects,

2
00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:05.720
it's a little bit vague.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.202
And I think sometimes people don't have
a very clear understanding of what

4
00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:10.580
accessibility is.

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.428
So I think one of the main takeaways I
want to get out of this course is that

6
00:00:14.428 --> 00:00:17.508
when people talk about mobile app or
web accessibility,

7
00:00:17.508 --> 00:00:22.570
they're talking about making those apps
usable for people with disabilities.

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.886
I really liked this kind
of quote from the web aim,

9
00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:28.170
which is a nonprofit that we'll
talk about in a little bit.

10
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.887
It says when websites and
web tools are properly designed and coded,

11
00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:34.480
people with disabilities can use them.

12
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.439
However, currently, many sites and tools
are developed with accessibility barriers

13
00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:41.280
that make them difficult or
impossible for some of us.

14
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.430
Making the web accessible benefits
individuals, businesses, and society.

15
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.850
So I liked a lot of that, I liked that.

16
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.534
When we do things right, folks across
a wide spectrum of different disabilities

17
00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:57.580
can get the most out of our site, can
completely use it easily and productively.

18
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.277
However, a lot of sites that exist today
have major accessibility issues that

19
00:01:01.277 --> 00:01:03.210
prevent folks from using them.

20
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.364
And then I really liked at
the end that it's like,

21
00:01:05.364 --> 00:01:07.740
making the websites accessible
benefits everybody.

22
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.151
I mean, it benefits your company,
it benefits people with disabilities,

23
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:12.340
it benefits power users.

24
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.061
It benefits your regular majority users,

25
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.250
everybody benefits from
making accessible websites.

26
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.316
I think some other reason that folks
get a little bit confused is because

27
00:01:23.316 --> 00:01:28.510
accessibility reaches into a lot of other
fields, or shares a lot of similarities.

28
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.441
So when I give talks on accessibility,

29
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.140
I often get questions about
these three other fields.

30
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.366
So I kind of wanted to cover
them really quick, and

31
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.290
talk about where they share things,
and then where they differ.

32
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.590
So the first one is web performance.

33
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.440
And specifically, web performance is when
you think about making your mobile web

34
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.094
app or your mobile native app
really small and really fast, so

35
00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:52.650
that folks all over the world can use it.

36
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.221
So making an app that's very easily
usable by folks on slower connections, or

37
00:01:57.221 --> 00:02:00.840
with slower devices is really
similar to accessibility.

38
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.957
But again, accessibility is
about people with disability, so

39
00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.880
it's not exactly the same thing.

40
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.750
Although it's a great thing to learn,
a great thing to be doing.

41
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.920
Another one is internationalization.

42
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.059
So that's the process of
making your app translated and

43
00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.610
then usable in people's native languages.

44
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.448
So if you have like a language switcher,
or if you detect the system language and

45
00:02:20.448 --> 00:02:23.330
then automatically switch the content for
users.

46
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.893
Again, this is like really great,
and it's important, and

47
00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:29.710
it helps a wider range of
folks use your website.

48
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.290
But it's, again, not exactly what
we're gonna be covering today.

49
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.840
And then the third one is UI design.

50
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.800
And specifically,
UI design is when we talk about making

51
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.080
your app really intuitive,
easy to use, easy to understand.

52
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.746
Things like that are really helpful,
again, increasing your audience,

53
00:02:44.746 --> 00:02:47.980
increasing your user base,
all those things are great.

54
00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.020
But again,
it's not exactly what we're into today.

55
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.500
So for today, web accessibility means
people with disabilities can use the web.

56
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.238
I also really liked this quote,
because for

57
00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:00.900
me the web is like a really special place.

58
00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.902
It's not a walled garden,
it's very easy for folks to contribute, or

59
00:03:04.902 --> 00:03:08.140
carve out their own spaces,
or create content.

60
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.484
So this quote really stood out to
me where it says more specifically,

61
00:03:11.484 --> 00:03:14.946
web accessibility means that people
with disabilities can perceive,

62
00:03:14.946 --> 00:03:17.440
understand, navigate and
interact with the web.

63
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.990
And then this part, and
that they can contribute to the web.

64
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.292
And I think it's important to keep in
mind as we go through this workshop,

65
00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:26.760
that we're not just trying
to meet some bare minimum.

66
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.460
We're not saying like, hey,
we'll have this really robust app.

67
00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.034
And then we'll detect if a user
has a disability, and if so,

68
00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:34.670
we'll give them a quick summary or
a short version.

69
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.498
We're really trying to make robust apps
that people with disabilities can get

70
00:03:38.498 --> 00:03:39.780
the absolute most out of.

71
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.155
So being able to contribute,
being able to upload their own media,

72
00:03:44.155 --> 00:03:46.010
being able to add comments.

73
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.791
Being able to make edits
anything that anyone else can do,

74
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.040
everyone should be able to do, and
that's really important to me.

75
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.234
Another thing I find really interesting is
when we start talking about the wide range

76
00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:59.960
of disabilities that we're
going to cover in this course.

77
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.627
Just kind of the magnitude of it, so

78
00:04:01.627 --> 00:04:04.530
I had some statistics that have
always really stood out to me.

79
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.978
So in the United States, one in four, or

80
00:04:06.978 --> 00:04:11.390
a little bit over 26% of adults
have some type of disability.

81
00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.570
And then as folks get older, it goes up.

82
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.709
So it goes from one and four to two and
five by the time you're 65 years of age.

83
00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.267
20% of people in the US report
some type of hearing loss,

84
00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:24.770
and 29 million of them could
benefit from hearing aids.

85
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.035
So I want to as we go through this course,

86
00:04:27.035 --> 00:04:30.180
start thinking about
different disabilities.

87
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.808
Internalizing them, and thinking about
how that might affect the experience of

88
00:04:33.808 --> 00:04:36.470
browsing your application,
or the web in general.

89
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.550
And then learning about really cool and
easy ways that we can make that experience

90
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.103
way better, that's sort of the cycle
of this course is going to take.

91
00:04:44.103 --> 00:04:50.190
2.3% have visual disability, and 1 million
people in the US alone are legally blind.

92
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.530
So we're thinking about folks, a large
amount of folks with some disability.

93
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.970
A lot of folks that report
some kind of hearing loss,

94
00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.830
a lot of folks that report
some kind of visual loss.

95
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.280
And then 16% of people in the US have
difficulties with their physical function.

96
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.011
So again, we start thinking about, okay,
if folks have some kind of physical

97
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:12.210
functioning disability, what can we do
to make our sights better for them?

98
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.634
And then around 8 million people in
the US have an intellectual disability,

99
00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:18.150
including a really large
amount of children.

100
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.270
So again, we're kinda like looking
at this empathizing with folks and

101
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.950
thinking, okay, well,
what can we do to make this a lot better?

102
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.285
And again, kind of thinking of all
the different types of disabilities, and

103
00:05:28.285 --> 00:05:30.300
how those would affect
people using your app.

104
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.404
So mobile and
physical disabilities versus cognitive and

105
00:05:33.404 --> 00:05:37.583
neurological disabilities, folks with
some kind of hearing disability, or

106
00:05:37.583 --> 00:05:40.100
some kind of visual disability.

107
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.836
And again, we're going to
cover all of these in detail,

108
00:05:42.836 --> 00:05:45.914
just trying to get folks like kind
of a high level idea of, yeah,

109
00:05:45.914 --> 00:05:49.800
we're talking about how to think about it,
things like that.

110
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.662
One other interesting thing is that, I
always do this like my kind of sales pitch

111
00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:58.890
for folks is that,
the web by itself is extremely accessible.

112
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:03.010
So I'm not sure how much folks know about,
kind of how the web came to be.

113
00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.886
The standard's body is that
work on things like the W3, but

114
00:06:06.886 --> 00:06:09.740
a lot of thought goes into this stuff.

115
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.470
And so
I always use this kind of fun example, so

116
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.060
this is what is considered by some
to be the very first website.

117
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.607
So it's on the CERN web address right now,
and

118
00:06:19.607 --> 00:06:23.140
it's like this introduction to
the World Wide Web called W3.

119
00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.741
A hypermedia information retrieval
initiative was kind of funny,

120
00:06:26.741 --> 00:06:30.730
like a blast from the past, but
if you look at this site, it's very basic.

121
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.590
It's just HTML, there's no CSS or
JavaScript or anything.

122
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.904
But if we start thinking about things,

123
00:06:35.904 --> 00:06:40.470
this site performance is very well
against an accessibility audit, right?

124
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.810
So the links you can move around
to with your keyboard only.

125
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.476
If we open a screen reader,
which we'll go into later,

126
00:06:46.476 --> 00:06:50.020
it'll read all the links are labeled and
are well reasoned about.

127
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.175
And so I think kind of the point that I
want to drive home is if you're making

128
00:06:54.175 --> 00:06:58.560
a web app, and you were to just use HTML,
it would be fairly accessible.

129
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.622
Where we get into issues is when folks
start adding a lot of CSS and a lot of

130
00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:07.260
JavaScript to provide this robustness,
it becomes inaccessible in some ways.

131
00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:11.059
And so I think one thing to kind of keep
in mind is that we're not spending extra

132
00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:12.696
work making the web accessible,

133
00:07:12.696 --> 00:07:16.000
it's like we spent extra work
making it a little inaccessible.

134
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.647
And so this class is about kind of
teaching you all how to counter that, and

135
00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:19.640
make it accessible again.

136
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.073
Because there's some really cool tools
out there, you can have very complex

137
00:07:24.073 --> 00:07:28.040
workflows that are very accessible,
which is very exciting for me.

138
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.496
I always do this too as part
of my selling point, so

139
00:07:30.496 --> 00:07:33.310
reasons developers should
learn accessibility.

140
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.540
Well, it's fun.

141
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.141
I truly believe that not
trying to be cheesy,

142
00:07:37.141 --> 00:07:39.270
I think that it's like really cool.

143
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.090
You start kind of empathizing with a lot
of folks, you start using tools that you

144
00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.180
maybe haven't used before,
such as a screen reader.

145
00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.480
And it's really fun,
it's fun to check out your website,

146
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.308
learn a lot more about how it's
structured and how it functions, and

147
00:07:53.308 --> 00:07:57.350
then make small precise corrections
that make it a lot better.

148
00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:00.233
I don't know how many of you
all have ever tried something,

149
00:08:00.233 --> 00:08:04.280
I remember the first time I used the Lynx
browser, a text only web browser, right?

150
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.990
So it doesn't render anything visual.

151
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.243
And I started looking at all my websites,
and it just dumps them out in this pure

152
00:08:09.243 --> 00:08:12.180
structure of headings, and
links, and things like that.

153
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.670
And it really blew my mind, I was like,
I really have to redo a lot of this stuff.

154
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:19.220
Cuz you'll do something like,
I don't want to use heading tags,

155
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.650
I'll just use paragraphs.

156
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.850
We'll give them a CSS class and then I'll
make them large, or something like that.

157
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.910
And then over time you open it
up in a text only browser, and

158
00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:28.600
it's really difficult to use.

159
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.292
I find that experience a lot
with accessibility as well,

160
00:08:31.292 --> 00:08:33.210
where I'll kind of do all these things.

161
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:36.721
These little hacks, or little tricks, or
whatever, just to kind of get through, and

162
00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:39.380
then I'll open it up in a screen
reader and it's very difficult.

163
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.443
So I have a lot of fun kind of doing that,
and it's really important to remember that

164
00:08:43.443 --> 00:08:46.070
a lot of these accessibility
issues are caused by us.

165
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:50.719
As developers, we make an experience with
JavaScript and CSS that's inaccessible,

166
00:08:50.719 --> 00:08:52.830
and so we're kind of taking that back.

167
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.190
Another thing is the human rights angle.

168
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:58.776
One, I'm just a really big proponent
of making things accessible for

169
00:08:58.776 --> 00:09:00.190
folks with disabilities.

170
00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.709
They absolutely deserve to be able to use
the web in the same way that folks without

171
00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:04.550
disabilities do.

172
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.208
The other thing is I've had a lot
of really great experiences over

173
00:09:09.208 --> 00:09:13.004
the years meeting folks that
are either accessibility developers, or

174
00:09:13.004 --> 00:09:16.360
using the web as power users
with some sort of disability.

175
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.477
And kind of getting to know them,
getting to know their stories, and

176
00:09:19.477 --> 00:09:22.670
just working together to find really
cool ways to make things happen.

177
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.880
It's also a legal issue.

178
00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.212
It's becoming more and more so common
place that you can get into some legal

179
00:09:29.212 --> 00:09:32.250
trouble for
not having an accessible web presence.

180
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:36.272
We've seen a few lawsuits recently, mostly
on government sites and things like that.

181
00:09:36.272 --> 00:09:40.644
But I do think the future, much like we
have accessibility guidelines for brick

182
00:09:40.644 --> 00:09:45.160
and mortar buildings, we'll have the same
thing for web and mobile apps as well.

183
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.780
There's also some selfish reasons,
like you can reach away larger audience.

184
00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.660
We're talking about in many cases
like 25% of the world population.

185
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:57.377
So being able to make your site
a little bit easier to use for

186
00:09:57.377 --> 00:10:01.380
people with disabilities could open you up
to a lot more customers, a lot more users.

187
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.660
It's really impactful too.

188
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.628
So even a more selfish reason maybe is,
I think it's a really cool thing,

189
00:10:07.628 --> 00:10:09.870
this kinda goes with the last one.

190
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.074
When you get a job as a developer,
especially as you become more of

191
00:10:13.074 --> 00:10:16.630
a senior developer, I think that
specializing is really important.

192
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.986
Not that you have to do it all the time,
but that you're kind of known maybe on

193
00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:22.990
your team or in your org for
being really good at something.

194
00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.899
I think that accessibility is
a great thing to specialize in,

195
00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:28.560
it's really impactful.

196
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.866
It means a lot to a lot of folks, and
so taking some time to learn about

197
00:10:31.866 --> 00:10:34.780
accessibility and
then kind of going into your work.

198
00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.854
For example, I know larger
companies like Twitter and Adobe,

199
00:10:37.854 --> 00:10:40.240
they have whole
accessibility organisations.

200
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.558
Where they want someone in each org to
be like an accessibility shepherd, or

201
00:10:44.558 --> 00:10:47.060
the go to person for accessibility issues.

202
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.163
So I think becoming that person can be
really impactful on your career, and yeah,

203
00:10:51.163 --> 00:10:52.241
and really helpful.
