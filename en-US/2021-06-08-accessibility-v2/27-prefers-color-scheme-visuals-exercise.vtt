00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.790
Another one that's very cool.

2
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.861
And again, another curb cut effect because
I think it's very cool from a design

3
00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:08.690
standpoint too is prefers color scheme.

4
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.502
So a lot of operating systems these
days including Apple allow you to

5
00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:15.620
set your color scheme.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.371
And so I think if I go to Preferences
whereas it's maybe like Appearance,

7
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:27.330
and then I can select light mode,
I can select dark mode, things like that.

8
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.440
So at an operating system level,
I've chosen dark mode.

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.190
Well, now we have this ability
to read into that setting and

10
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.620
change things accordingly,
which is really cool.

11
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.370
I do this on my personal site,
and we do this on Twitter, and

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.570
we did it on some Adobe sites as well.

13
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.389
So again, think about your HTML and

14
00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:45.370
you've got your main wrapper
class inside the body tags.

15
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.634
So you give it a class of wrapper and then
you do these prefers colour schemes again.

16
00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:52.395
So you do okay media query if
they prefer dark then we set

17
00:00:52.395 --> 00:00:55.413
wrappers background to be black,
the whole page is black.

18
00:00:55.413 --> 00:00:59.354
I guess I should probably add colour,
you know, white or something for contrast.

19
00:00:59.354 --> 00:01:01.841
Otherwise, if they prefer
the color scheme light,

20
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:04.830
we set the wrapper background
to be white instead.

21
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.223
And so now you can have this site that's
like very dynamic, where as soon as

22
00:01:09.223 --> 00:01:13.269
they load the page, whatever your
operating system level is set to,

23
00:01:13.269 --> 00:01:16.670
you can go ahead and
just set your page to that.

24
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.904
This one's really interesting too though,
because if you think about it, it's very

25
00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:25.090
trendy these days for websites to include
their own manual dark mode toggle, right?

26
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.690
So if you go to a blog and it has, for
an example I have one on my site, right?

27
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.722
So I have this little like day night
thing, and you click it and it goes dark,

28
00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:36.055
and then you click it again,
it goes light.

29
00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:38.790
So now we're like, okay,
we have this toggle, right?

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.160
And we have the prefers color
scheme from the system design.

31
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.749
And then we also probably to make a really
good experience, if I set this to light

32
00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:52.990
and I refresh the page, I don't want it to
be dark because they already chose light.

33
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.160
So it's probably locally cached too.

34
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.261
So you kind of end up in a little
bit of a complicated space, right?

35
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:01.635
Where you're like, okay, maybe the first
thing you that you do is you check

36
00:02:01.635 --> 00:02:04.799
the user's cache to see if you've
manually saved their preference for

37
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.710
your site, they prefer light.

38
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.552
And if that's not there,
then maybe as a second thought,

39
00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:13.265
you check their preferences and you see
if they prefer a lighter dark seem and

40
00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.740
that's added to that.

41
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.700
And if that's not there,

42
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.490
then maybe you have a total default
based on the toggle or whatever.

43
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.600
So it's a little bit interesting.

44
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.960
I think that like the reduced
motion is very simple.

45
00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.250
They prefer reduce motion.

46
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.880
So don't do animations.

47
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.901
The light mode, dark mode can get
tricky if you offer light mode

48
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:31.880
dark mode as a clickable experience
in your existing web app.

49
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.210
You can get a little bit tricky there, but
I think, I still think it's really great.

50
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.797
Any questions about that for
moving to the exercise?

51
00:02:39.797 --> 00:02:41.290
Yeah, that's a great question.

52
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.300
So yeah, it's like are there also
JavaScript API's for these things?

53
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.327
And the example is like if you have
some JavaScript animated thing, and

54
00:02:48.327 --> 00:02:50.940
you know that they prefer reduce motion,
can you do it?

55
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.870
So I think I also like, can you do
it without media queries, right?

56
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.730
If you're not in CSS, but
in JavaScript, is that fair?

57
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.380
Okay, yeah, so there is an API for,
trying remember the name of it.

58
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.280
There's an API where you can
get media query information.

59
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.130
And the name of it is, yes.

60
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.500
So you can do it this way.

61
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.040
Let me link this in the,
I'm not logged into the chat, but.

62
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.127
So you can do window dot match media and
then you can pass in any type of

63
00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:22.920
query selector that CSS takes and
it'll return true or false for you.

64
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.390
So this would be same with like Mac
screen size, anything like that.

65
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.460
But yeah, so you could do if window
match media prefers colour scheme.

66
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.660
So it won't be true or false.

67
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.810
For this one, it'll be lighter dark for
this one based on what you've set.

68
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.970
So then you could do something like if
window match media prefers color scheme

69
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.750
equals light.

70
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.110
Do this.
Otherwise do that.

71
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.140
It's a great question.

72
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.460
All right, last exercise.

73
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.087
So I'll take 10 to do this and
then I will be on the automation tooling,

74
00:03:46.087 --> 00:03:49.670
all sorts of other cool stuff but
no more exercises.

75
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.889
So for this exercise, read the user's
dark light mode preference and

76
00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.730
set the background to like a dark color or
light color.

77
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.034
And then if you want,
if you're a JavaScript person for

78
00:04:01.034 --> 00:04:05.830
extra credit, [LAUGH] you can also enable
the checkbox to override that setting.

79
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.327
So, I think the first thing what we should
be able to see is here, as I pick light,

80
00:04:10.327 --> 00:04:14.610
this page should go white and
as I pick dark, this page should go black.

81
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.787
And if you wanted to get fancy way that
you could also allow the checkbox to

82
00:04:17.787 --> 00:04:18.996
override those settings.
