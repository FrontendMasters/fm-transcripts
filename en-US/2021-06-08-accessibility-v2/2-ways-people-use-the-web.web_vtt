WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.764
So yeah, let's next look into all the
different amazing ways people use the web.

2
00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:07.401
And I wanna kind of go over these and
then maybe we could stop and

3
00:00:07.401 --> 00:00:09.732
have a little discussion on
what the impact of that is or

4
00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:13.480
what you think about when you
think about these different ways.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.690
So the first way that people
use the web is keyboard only.

6
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.254
This can be a lot of different folks,
folks that struggle to use a mouse for

7
00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:22.010
numerous different reasons.

8
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.204
It also can just be oftentimes power users
that are just trying to get keyboard

9
00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:30.650
shortcuts to move faster through
their their day-to-day jobs.

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.683
So when we think about
keyboard-only users,

11
00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:35.140
we think about folks that
aren't able to use the mouse.

12
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.457
So I wanna think about is everything on
your website accessible keyboard only?

13
00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:42.213
I'm not sure.

14
00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:45.237
Are there things that you can only
click on but you can't maybe tab to or

15
00:00:45.237 --> 00:00:46.910
something like that?

16
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.886
I also wanna think about things that
are very quick to do in a mouse.

17
00:00:50.886 --> 00:00:54.394
For example, scrolling to the bottom
of a page and clicking on a form.

18
00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:58.263
That might take forever to do on
a keyboard if you're just tab,

19
00:00:58.263 --> 00:01:00.676
tab, tab tabbing all the way through.

20
00:01:00.676 --> 00:01:04.360
Other folks use these really great
assistive technologies like a head wand.

21
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.593
So for that you can basically think
about a user having a keyboard and

22
00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:09.475
accessing it with a wand on their head.

23
00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:13.985
So again, the things we talked about
before become even more important,

24
00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:16.598
like how many keystrokes does
it take to do something?

25
00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:20.701
And is everything doable
via keyboard only?

26
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:23.704
Other folks use a mouth stick,
these are popular with tablets,

27
00:01:23.704 --> 00:01:26.645
as you can see in the picture,
same idea as a head wand.

28
00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:29.521
So again,
we're kind of thinking about these things.

29
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.896
One of my favorite pieces of
technology is a single switch.

30
00:01:33.896 --> 00:01:36.960
And folks use this that aren't
able to use a keyboard.

31
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.229
And so it literally is just one button.

32
00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.612
So if you imagine one of those, like
a virtual keyboard that you can bring up,

33
00:01:44.612 --> 00:01:46.442
the accessibility keyboards.

34
00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:48.272
So you hit the single switch once and

35
00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:52.540
it starts going row by row down
the virtual keyboard highlighting the row.

36
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.250
And then you hit it again and
then takes that row and saves it and

37
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.040
starts going column by column through.

38
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.640
So you could think about
it like the tilde row.

39
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.336
I'm just looking at my laptop, the Q row,
A, and then you hit the switch again and

40
00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:06.050
it goes into A, S, D, F.

41
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.230
Then you hit it again and it sends an F.

42
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.282
And so again, you can imagine that folks
using the keyboard like this would

43
00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:15.946
really benefit from anything you can
do to make it less keystrokes to

44
00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:19.182
get to the piece of content
that they're looking to get to.

45
00:02:19.182 --> 00:02:22.170
And then the last one that I wanna
cover for now is a screen reader.

46
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.770
And so a screen reader can be a completely
nonvisual way of interacting with the web.

47
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.569
So it's software that works on your
laptop, your phone, your iPad, whatever.

48
00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.667
And it will read out in an audio format,

49
00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:37.030
it'll read out all the content
that you're accessing.

50
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.220
And then users will input
just using their keyboard.

51
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.499
So it'll say, hey, this is a form,
please enter your first name.

52
00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.228
And then the user will, using a keyboard,
type their first name and hit next Next.

53
00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.030
And then it'll say, okay, hey,
this is a form, enter your password.

54
00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.780
So you kinda have this dialogue
going with the screen reader.

55
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.355
Does anybody have any questions about
those kind of formats or how they work or

56
00:02:57.355 --> 00:02:59.090
what people would use them for?

57
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.578
The question was, we have ways with
browsers of sniffing out things like is

58
00:03:03.578 --> 00:03:05.296
the user on a mobile device?

59
00:03:05.296 --> 00:03:08.555
Is there a way to sniff out things like
is the user using a screen reader?

60
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.528
Or is the user using assistive technology?

61
00:03:11.528 --> 00:03:13.720
At a very high level, the answer is no.

62
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.263
There's no API that says if a screen
reader or something like that.

63
00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:21.424
But there are really clever ways that
we can speak directly to assitive

64
00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:22.900
technologies.

65
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.984
So I do have some examples
coming up of that.

66
00:03:24.984 --> 00:03:29.521
But one thing that you could think about
is, if you could put a piece of content at

67
00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:34.126
the very top of your screen and hide it
with CSS, but it's still there with HTML,

68
00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:36.428
and you say, hey, screen reader user,

69
00:03:36.428 --> 00:03:40.338
check out this link for
keyboard shortcuts or something like that.

70
00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:43.144
Which is something we do when
I was working at twitter.com.

71
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.600
Visually, you will not
be able to see that.

72
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.899
But as the screen reader
starts reading all the HTML,

73
00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:50.698
the very first thing it'll read is that.

74
00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:51.980
And so we'll cover how to do that.

75
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.040
But yeah, the kinda big answer is no,
there's not a guaranteed way of doing it.

76
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.588
But there are some really cool
tricks that we can do to speak

77
00:03:59.588 --> 00:04:01.990
directly to users using
assistive technologies.

78
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.970
That's a great question too.

79
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.240
So just to repeat is thinking
about all these different devices,

80
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.926
does it mean that kinda anything that
you're doing is gonna benefit all of

81
00:04:09.926 --> 00:04:12.000
the users using those devices?

82
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.210
The short answer is absolutely yes.

83
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.353
I think that we really see
these very clear trends.

84
00:04:17.353 --> 00:04:20.004
Which is, for example,
right now we're looking at,

85
00:04:20.004 --> 00:04:22.130
can you do everything via keyboard?

86
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.356
And how much time are you willing to put
into neat ways of making it take less

87
00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:28.553
keystrokes to do that thing, right?

88
00:04:28.553 --> 00:04:31.486
And so we have a section later on
power user keyboard shortcuts and

89
00:04:31.486 --> 00:04:32.350
things like that.

90
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.770
But yeah, absolutely,
we're really looking at the same thing,

91
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.490
despite a wide array of devices.

92
00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.624
We're just looking at ways of making
a keyboard only, making it read really

93
00:04:41.624 --> 00:04:45.710
nicely to a screen reader, and
making it take fewer number of keystrokes.
