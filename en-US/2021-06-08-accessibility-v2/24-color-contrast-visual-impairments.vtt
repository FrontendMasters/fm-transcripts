00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.072
For this next section we're gonna
talk about a lot of different visual

2
00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:06.836
considerations, different things around
color and how people perceive websites.

3
00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:11.698
And then we'll get into some really
cool modern DOME API's that let us read

4
00:00:11.698 --> 00:00:16.111
a lot of user settings and
control our app experience accordingly.

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.480
So one of the first things I want
to talk about is color contrast.

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.321
And color contrast comes up in a number
of ways, mostly that there are a lot of

7
00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:26.819
different impairments that affect
people's ability to see color.

8
00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.242
And that makes it really difficult to
predict what colors will contrast well

9
00:00:31.242 --> 00:00:34.226
together and
which ones will blur into each other.

10
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:37.066
It also can make it really
difficult sometimes to signify like

11
00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.534
the difference between an error and
a success state.

12
00:00:39.534 --> 00:00:44.185
If you don't have some additional helpers,
which we'll get into in a little bit.

13
00:00:44.185 --> 00:00:49.124
But ultimately, it's really difficult to
tell just by looking at colors if they're

14
00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:51.603
going to have high enough contrast or not.

15
00:00:51.603 --> 00:00:55.201
Unless you're going with something
very stark like black on white or

16
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:56.078
white on black.

17
00:00:56.078 --> 00:00:59.553
So there are all sorts of cool
tools that can help you with it.

18
00:00:59.553 --> 00:01:03.166
One tool that you can just do is the
Lighthouse audit will actually look at all

19
00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.506
the content on your page and
tell you if there are any contrast issues.

20
00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:08.945
But if you're in the design phase,

21
00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:12.699
another really cool tool in
this web contrast bicker.

22
00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:17.312
And so the idea here is that you pick
a foreground color and a background color.

23
00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:21.010
And they will tell you the contrast ratio,
but more importantly,

24
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.787
they'll tell you if they pass or
fail on a couple of different axes.

25
00:01:24.787 --> 00:01:29.556
They'll tell you if they pass or fail for
small text if they pass or fail for large

26
00:01:29.556 --> 00:01:34.255
text and if they pass or fail for text
differentiated from some kind of border or

27
00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:36.983
interface like this here, this text input.

28
00:01:36.983 --> 00:01:38.821
And so what's really neat about it,

29
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.844
the other axes sorry,
is that they'll tell you if you pass or

30
00:01:41.844 --> 00:01:45.780
fail for AA compliance like we were
talking about with WCAG or AAA compliance.

31
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.052
So, if you have something really stark,
again, like just black foreground,

32
00:01:50.052 --> 00:01:53.497
white background, that's got
a really high contrast ratio and

33
00:01:53.497 --> 00:01:55.053
it passes across the board.

34
00:01:55.053 --> 00:01:58.189
As you start getting into
a little bit more iffy territory,

35
00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.513
like if you had a light gray
foreground and a white background,

36
00:02:01.513 --> 00:02:04.981
it's got a very low contrast ratio and
it fails across the board.

37
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.607
But what's really interesting to me is
that a lot of times you'll end up with

38
00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:09.238
something.

39
00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:11.708
Let's see if I can find one
like this in the middle,

40
00:02:11.708 --> 00:02:14.193
where you've got a reasonably
dark gray on white.

41
00:02:14.193 --> 00:02:19.464
It's got a reasonable contrast ratio, but
it fails except in certain circumstances.

42
00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:25.903
So for example, this 808080 against fff,
it's saying not good for normal size text.

43
00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:31.047
It's okay for large text if you only wanna
be AA compliant and it is acceptable for

44
00:02:31.047 --> 00:02:36.283
graphic interfaces like a grey border
around black text with a white background.

45
00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:40.978
So it's kind of interesting for a number
of reasons because you start realizing

46
00:02:40.978 --> 00:02:43.581
that color contrast is
a much bigger topic.

47
00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:47.529
At least for me than I once thought it was
where I thought things were either too

48
00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.982
similar or
different enough to be contrasted.

49
00:02:49.982 --> 00:02:53.245
But it turns out that there's actually
a lot more to it where it depends

50
00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:55.567
on the size,
it depends on the surroundings, and

51
00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:57.918
it depends on how compliant
you're trying to be.

52
00:02:57.918 --> 00:02:59.310
So this is a great tool.

53
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.905
I use it all the time in the design stage.

54
00:03:00.905 --> 00:03:04.179
A lot of design tools will also give
you accessibility warnings, but

55
00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:05.821
I just find this tool is very easy.

56
00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:09.999
You can paste taxes in and
instantly get some info.

57
00:03:09.999 --> 00:03:13.936
That's a really cool tool, chrome Dev
Tools, which I also teach a workshop on.

58
00:03:13.936 --> 00:03:15.882
I'm a big, big fan of the Dev Tools.

59
00:03:15.882 --> 00:03:19.028
They have a built in accessibility
color checker, which looks like this.

60
00:03:19.028 --> 00:03:20.750
It's very neat.

61
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.368
It's showing you as you're in the color
picker, if the content that you're on

62
00:03:24.368 --> 00:03:26.589
is accessible or
not in the same format, right?

63
00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:31.690
Well CAG, its AA or AAA compliant,
what's the contrast ratio is.

64
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.570
The issue with this is that in order for
it to work, it requires that you

65
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.642
have a parent element with a background
and a child element with a color.

66
00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:45.105
And if you don't have those, like for
example, if you just had a body tag with

67
00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:48.060
both background and color,
it won't be able to pick up on those.

68
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.110
But so for here as an example,

69
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.236
if I open the Dev Tools,
I made a Dev that's here.

70
00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:59.299
So if we take a look at it,
there's a Dev called dark.

71
00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.125
And this Dev has a background of black and

72
00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.577
then there's a paragraph inside called
light and that has a color of white.

73
00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.816
And so from here since we meet
the criteria, if we go ahead and

74
00:04:07.816 --> 00:04:10.177
we click on the little
box inside the color.

75
00:04:10.177 --> 00:04:14.914
It'll open up the color picker and we can
see that the contrast ratio information is

76
00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:17.223
here it's AA and triple AAA compliant.

77
00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:21.058
And then you can actually kind of drag
it around in real time and see, okay, so

78
00:04:21.058 --> 00:04:24.303
this against black would be bad but
as we get lighter and lighter,

79
00:04:24.303 --> 00:04:27.331
okay, that's double a compliant
with all the way to white.

80
00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:28.831
Okay, that's AAA compliant.

81
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:31.047
So this might not work for
all of your use cases.

82
00:04:31.047 --> 00:04:33.469
Again, if you just have one
element with both they won't work.

83
00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:37.865
But, in certain situations when you're
designing a child element inside a parent

84
00:04:37.865 --> 00:04:39.510
which has a background color.

85
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.890
These can be really handy as well and

86
00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.919
they're all getting the same
information though.

87
00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.678
What the contrast ratio is,
is it AA compliant, is it AAA compliant.

88
00:04:49.186 --> 00:04:51.380
The last thing I'll say
on color contrast and

89
00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.264
this is a big one I see when I
do consulting work especially,

90
00:04:54.264 --> 00:04:57.460
this is like one of the biggest
ones that make it into production.

91
00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.256
Is that oftentimes we'll do
front end validation on forms.

92
00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:05.875
So before you submit the form, it'll check
to see, did all the fields get filled out?

93
00:05:05.875 --> 00:05:08.480
Does the email look like an email
all of these things right?

94
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.877
And if they fail,
they will often make the border red.

95
00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:15.139
And if they pass,
they'll make the border green.

96
00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.115
And then it'll say something like, please
correct your mistakes and submit again.

97
00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:23.474
But the difficulty here is that those
colors might not be distinguishable for

98
00:05:23.474 --> 00:05:26.036
certain people with certain disabilities.

99
00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:28.636
And then they will have no idea
which fields are failing or

100
00:05:28.636 --> 00:05:29.944
which ones are succeeding.

101
00:05:29.944 --> 00:05:35.003
So that's why color itself and I like
this WebAIM word and color is not used

102
00:05:35.003 --> 00:05:40.326
as the sole method of conveying content or
distinguishing visual elements.

103
00:05:40.326 --> 00:05:43.981
Meaning it's totally fine to use red for
error and green for success.

104
00:05:43.981 --> 00:05:47.928
But you should put some text in there or
a label or an icon or some way for

105
00:05:47.928 --> 00:05:50.530
folks to know an asterisk
next to the errors.

106
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.746
Some way for folks to know
without just relying on color,

107
00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:56.696
where they need to interact and
which ones are done.

108
00:05:58.515 --> 00:06:02.543
Any questions on color,
color contrast using those tools, or

109
00:06:02.543 --> 00:06:04.901
the basic ideas behind those tools?

110
00:06:08.606 --> 00:06:13.363
Awesome, yeah, again, just calling
them out as I see like ones that I've

111
00:06:13.363 --> 00:06:17.967
seen a lot color on forums is like a big
one that I've run into many times,

112
00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:20.028
that has been caught in audits.

113
00:06:20.028 --> 00:06:25.020
Another one is just the world of visual
impairments is a lot bigger than I once

114
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.118
thought it was.

115
00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:29.491
There's this really neat
extension called no coffee,

116
00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:32.370
which simulates various
visual impairments.

117
00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.755
Unfortunately, they used to
have a chrome version, but

118
00:06:34.755 --> 00:06:36.604
the chrome version has been discontinued.

119
00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:40.293
So if you want to use it now,
you'll have to use it for Firefox.

120
00:06:40.293 --> 00:06:41.647
But it's really neat and

121
00:06:41.647 --> 00:06:46.045
it can really kind of help you understand
how different people see your website.

122
00:06:46.045 --> 00:06:49.453
So I'm going to switch
over to Firefox here,

123
00:06:49.453 --> 00:06:54.128
where I installed the plugin and
I'm just going to open it up.

124
00:06:54.128 --> 00:06:55.911
And so it does a lot of cool things.

125
00:06:55.911 --> 00:07:00.324
You can mess with certain
things directly like ghosting.

126
00:07:00.324 --> 00:07:02.158
So let me set this back to normal and

127
00:07:02.158 --> 00:07:06.020
you can mess with something like take
ghosting and start expanding it and

128
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.712
you'll see that the letters kind
of start shifting from each other.

129
00:07:09.712 --> 00:07:14.464
You can also kind of simulate
certain blockages that people have.

130
00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:18.458
So like what, a glaucoma.

131
00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:21.430
Sorry, make that a little
better central blockage or

132
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.934
a corner blockage all these different
things so you can kind of simulate things.

133
00:07:25.934 --> 00:07:32.247
I always really like this because it helps
see how like some nuanced things like for

134
00:07:32.247 --> 00:07:36.732
an example I think like looking
at some of these ones with,

135
00:07:36.732 --> 00:07:41.232
okay here we go with like floaters or
something like that.

136
00:07:41.232 --> 00:07:43.910
It can help me really
understand that certain

137
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.366
chaotic designs can be very
distracting for some people.

138
00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:52.014
The other thing that's really important
is for folks that have a limited range of

139
00:07:52.014 --> 00:07:54.964
view that you keep like
content next to each other.

140
00:07:54.964 --> 00:07:59.386
I have this really interesting anecdote
again from a conference that I spoke at

141
00:07:59.386 --> 00:08:03.741
where one where one of the other speakers
that talked on accessibility had low

142
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:04.278
vision.

143
00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:05.579
So she wasn't blind, but

144
00:08:05.579 --> 00:08:08.845
she did need assistive technologies
to help with a lot of things.

145
00:08:08.845 --> 00:08:13.280
And she was talking about how she had
recently been learning how to code using

146
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.673
a popular coding site.

147
00:08:14.673 --> 00:08:19.760
And the issues simply was that as she
would type in things, the feedback loop so

148
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.329
like errors, compilation errors,
on the other side of her monitor.

149
00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:28.359
And she has a limited field of vision,
so for her she's looking at this it he,

150
00:08:28.359 --> 00:08:32.281
she's typing stuff, he's hitting run,
she's seeing nothing change.

151
00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:33.932
Surgeons have given up on the platform.

152
00:08:33.932 --> 00:08:37.132
It's only weeks later that she's
complaining to a friend that they realize

153
00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:39.732
what's going on,
which is just that the related information

154
00:08:39.732 --> 00:08:41.884
was just actually physical
distance too far away.

155
00:08:41.884 --> 00:08:43.778
She wasn't able to see that feedback loop.

156
00:08:43.778 --> 00:08:47.551
So it's kind of interesting thinking
about some of your UX structure.

157
00:08:47.551 --> 00:08:51.134
And for folks with limited field of view,
and I also think it comes back

158
00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:55.085
into this thing of we're not just dealing
with people with perfect vision and

159
00:08:55.085 --> 00:08:56.328
people with no vision.

160
00:08:56.328 --> 00:08:58.573
We're dealing with this really wide range,

161
00:08:58.573 --> 00:09:02.603
this like ever growing population of folks
with some sort of visual impairment.

162
00:09:02.603 --> 00:09:06.273
And so these things like using big font,
good color contrast,

163
00:09:06.273 --> 00:09:09.957
keeping like things near each other,
can be a really big help.

164
00:09:09.957 --> 00:09:14.035
I know this one is a little bit more on
the design side than the development side

165
00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:15.305
but it's really good.

166
00:09:15.305 --> 00:09:18.856
And I think as an accessibility developer,
it's really good to be able to give your

167
00:09:18.856 --> 00:09:20.953
design and
product folks that kind of feedback.

168
00:09:20.953 --> 00:09:25.616
Say hey, I'm a little bit worried that
these things are a little far away or

169
00:09:25.616 --> 00:09:29.482
the fonts too small or
the colors are not contrasting enough.

170
00:09:29.482 --> 00:09:33.342
And yeah, this kind of the proximity
notifications that I was talking about

171
00:09:33.342 --> 00:09:36.069
before where keeping like
things together can help.

172
00:09:36.069 --> 00:09:40.150
This is also like, like I was mentioning
that this helps folks who have low vision

173
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:42.987
it also helps people with
neurological disabilities.

174
00:09:42.987 --> 00:09:44.937
It honestly helps everyone for
the most part,

175
00:09:44.937 --> 00:09:46.645
I think keeping things close together.

176
00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:50.204
I think is another great curb cut example
back to the first slide where you do these

177
00:09:50.204 --> 00:09:52.925
things to make things easier for
people with disabilities and

178
00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.776
it ends up making it easier for everyone.

179
00:09:54.776 --> 00:09:56.695
So kind of a big giant win.

180
00:09:58.427 --> 00:10:00.529
Any questions on those kind
of visual impairments?

181
00:10:00.529 --> 00:10:05.398
I know it's a lot more of a gray area
of the sense of it's hard to it's not

182
00:10:05.398 --> 00:10:07.518
a simple set of rules, right?

183
00:10:07.518 --> 00:10:11.326
I'm not like this needs to be this and the
sort of color contrast is a set of rules.

184
00:10:11.326 --> 00:10:13.712
The rest of the stuff I think
is just good food for thought.

185
00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:14.850
Just something nice to think about.
