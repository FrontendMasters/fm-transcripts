1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.650
I often find that for folks that don't
know a ton about accessibility but

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.528
are just getting started, that alt text is
one of the most popular things people hear

3
00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:09.623
about when they think about accessibility.

4
00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:14.177
And we talked about it a little bit
before, but the idea here being that when

5
00:00:14.177 --> 00:00:18.877
a screen reader encounters an image by
default, if you just have image source

6
00:00:18.877 --> 00:00:23.610
food.jpg, it'll read the file's name
to the user, trying to be helpful.

7
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.349
So this is kind of nice sometimes
if you name your images properly.

8
00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.918
if you have one that's cutepuppy.jpeg,
then it'll read that out loud.

9
00:00:31.918 --> 00:00:34.597
But it gets really tricky
with websites that allow

10
00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:36.909
users to upload their own images, right?

11
00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:38.556
So if you run a web app like that,

12
00:00:38.556 --> 00:00:42.520
you always have to come up with unique
names so there's not collisions.

13
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.760
So you end up doing things
like hashing these images.

14
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.941
So I pulled some examples from Flicker,
Facebook and

15
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.130
Twitter that can show how
bad things can get, right?

16
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.392
So these are all of course understandable,

17
00:00:53.392 --> 00:00:57.133
that they would give these unique
number and string names to the images.

18
00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.469
But just imagine being on a screen
reader and you're tabbing through or

19
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.192
something like that and it says image of
17242890, just starts reading this stuff.

20
00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:13.880
Or even worse like this Facebook one which
is a PHP file with a bunch of stuff at it.

21
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.950
So it's an important
thing to keep in mind.

22
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.971
So adding an alt attribute to these
will cause the screen reader to read

23
00:01:19.971 --> 00:01:23.255
whatever you put in the alt
text instead of the file name.

24
00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:28.609
So here's an example here of an image with
a really long kind of hashed file name,

25
00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.597
but we say a puppy in the park.

26
00:01:30.597 --> 00:01:34.060
When the screen reader hits that,
it'll just say a puppy in the park.

27
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.030
It won't read that name.

28
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.238
And then the other thing to keep in mind,
so if you have an image and you made that

29
00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:44.820
image, you're uploading it, add alt
text yourself something descriptive.

30
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.220
Remember, you don't need to say a picture
of because the screen reader will do that.

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.160
It'll tell you it's an image.

32
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.610
So just say what's in it.

33
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.372
However, back to the users
uploading stuff,

34
00:01:53.372 --> 00:01:56.444
there's gonna be a lot of times building
web apps where you don't know what's in

35
00:01:56.444 --> 00:01:58.420
the picture when you're coding, right?

36
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.496
So if a user can upload
a picture to Facebook,

37
00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:03.190
Facebook doesn't know what
that picture's going to be.

38
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.640
And so those times,
if you don't know what the picture is,

39
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.520
you have kind of two options.

40
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.015
One, you can put something in, something
generic, user uploaded content or

41
00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:14.850
something like that.

42
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.890
Or two, you can put in an empty alt text.

43
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.930
So, this is different than no alt text.

44
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.875
So alt with an empty string will cause the
screen reader to skip over it not reading

45
00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:24.408
it at all.

46
00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:28.454
This is also really valuable if you
have images that are decorative.

47
00:02:28.454 --> 00:02:31.142
Say you're making a website
with some really nice

48
00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:35.090
rounded corners that are pictures,
PNGs or something like that.

49
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.241
Putting an empty alt on those will make
sure screen readers just totally ignore

50
00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.209
them and
know that they're decorative images.

51
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.521
And then the last thing with alt text,

52
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.780
which we talked about
a little bit before is SEO.

53
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.699
So search engine engineers also really
want in on that alt text because search

54
00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:54.635
engines crawl that alt text and
use it to help rank your site for

55
00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:57.294
whatever keywords you're looking for.

56
00:02:57.294 --> 00:03:02.830
And so for years SEO shops have
been stuffing keywords into that.

57
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.713
So again, you'll upload a picture
of a family at the beach.

58
00:03:05.713 --> 00:03:10.190
But your blog post is about
saving money on car insurance.

59
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.220
And so the whole alt text will say,

60
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.560
hey, save money on car insurance
instead of a family at the beach.

61
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.767
And just a little bit helpful for
your SEO but really difficult for

62
00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:21.460
accessible screen reader users.

63
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.240
So I would really encourage folks,
I know Google has devalued the ranking of

64
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.110
this alt text over the years, to still
do the appropriate alternative text.

65
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.691
I also think that there's ways
that you can kinda settle both.

66
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:37.879
I'm often thinking when I'm writing blogs,
like a marketing blog or whatever,

67
00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.561
it's like well I needed to be descriptive,
right?

68
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:42.440
It has to work for screen reader users.

69
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.818
But I think you can also kind
of move the words around,

70
00:03:45.818 --> 00:03:50.570
just maybe a family at the beach having
just saved money on car insurance.

71
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.510
I don't know, something like that right,
that you can do for everybody.

72
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.561
But I would say the big priority would
be making sure that it reads well for

73
00:03:56.561 --> 00:03:57.480
screen readers.

74
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.200
But this is one area where there might be
a little bit of bumpiness at your company.

75
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.475
Again, looking at the webAIM
recommendation from the last section,

76
00:04:05.475 --> 00:04:08.310
just covering what we've
just covered here.

77
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.722
So there's only one conformance level.

78
00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:14.730
It says images form image buttons and
image maps need alt text.

79
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.550
Images that don't convey content should
have an empty alt text like we covered.

80
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.590
And equivalent alternatives to complex
images are provided in text which we

81
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.793
didn't really cover.

82
00:04:24.793 --> 00:04:28.699
But if you have something that you need,
that's very vital for

83
00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.278
the blog post or the page that you're on,

84
00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:36.230
one solution that you can do is you
can have the image, empty alt text.

85
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.830
So that is hidden from screen readers but
visible to sighted users, right?

86
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.019
And then right underneath it, you can
have a DIV with some content in it, but

87
00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:46.470
make it visually hidden.

88
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.189
So that is visible to the screen reader,
but hidden from vision users.

89
00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.000
I'm going to pause that one,
make sure it makes sense.

90
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.076
So you can basically do
the opposite approaches.

91
00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:58.663
You can have an image that you
hide from screen readers and

92
00:04:58.663 --> 00:05:02.186
then some text that you hide
from non-screen readers.

93
00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:04.484
Hope that makes sense, and
we can kind of cover and

94
00:05:04.484 --> 00:05:06.243
approach on that in the next section.

95
00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:12.705
Awesome, and then the last thing,

96
00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:18.780
in the same vein of images need
alternative text, audio needs captions.

97
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.540
So remembering that not all
content on the web is visual.

98
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.450
If you have video content,
be sure that you have captions for them.

99
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.850
Some places like YouTube provide
auto captioning, which is awesome.

100
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.106
Other folks, like I run a JavaScript
conference, and we just pay for

101
00:05:32.106 --> 00:05:33.238
a captioning service.

102
00:05:33.238 --> 00:05:35.380
They're really great.
They're affordable.

103
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.950
They listen to the talk in
real time as they're going and

104
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.310
then they just caption them
put that up on a screen.

105
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.687
So there's something to keep in
mind if you're doing events,

106
00:05:43.687 --> 00:05:47.790
if you're doing videos,
if you're doing any kind of audio content.

107
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.574
Some type of transcript,
some type of captioning service.

108
00:05:50.574 --> 00:05:52.930
And this one which we covered already.

109
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.407
This one actually does have
a few different levels,

110
00:05:55.407 --> 00:05:56.767
as we saw on the webAIM site.

111
00:05:56.767 --> 00:06:01.290
But just for level A,
a transcript of content is provided.

112
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.050
You could do synchronized captions for
non-live video.

113
00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.527
So if it's not streaming live,

114
00:06:05.527 --> 00:06:08.670
it should have captions already
there like YouTube does.

115
00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.780
That's all for that,
that's all for screeners.
