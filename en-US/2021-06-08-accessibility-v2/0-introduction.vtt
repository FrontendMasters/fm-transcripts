00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.371
Hey everybody, welcome to my
introduction to accessibility workshop.

2
00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:05.499
Before we get into it,
I just want to do a little housekeeping.

3
00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:10.617
This workshop can be found on my GitHub,

4
00:00:10.617 --> 00:00:16.792
which is github.com/jkup/learn-a11y So

5
00:00:16.792 --> 00:00:19.659
here learn-a11y.

6
00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:27.145
And it can also be found online
at learn-a11y.netlify.app.

7
00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:28.628
And so you can do it either way.

8
00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:32.004
We're gonna have a bunch of exercises
later on, so you might wanna go ahead and

9
00:00:32.004 --> 00:00:32.681
grab the code.

10
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:35.577
But otherwise, if you just wanna
follow along on the amplify app,

11
00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.985
you can feel free to do that too.

12
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:41.364
For the code itself, there's no server or
build tool or anything like that required.

13
00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:45.720
So you go ahead and either get clone it or
you can just download it as like a zip and

14
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.637
unzip it and it's just HTML file.

15
00:00:47.637 --> 00:00:49.350
So it should be pretty easy
to get set up and going.

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.489
A little bit about me.

17
00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.003
My name is john Cooperman.

18
00:00:52.003 --> 00:00:54.570
I've been doing software engineering for

19
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.571
the last 12 years or so
mostly web development.

20
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:01.224
And during the last, I don't know,
five or six years I've started

21
00:01:01.224 --> 00:01:04.573
to really specialize in web
performance and accessibility.

22
00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:06.504
So I love teaching about that stuff.

23
00:01:06.504 --> 00:01:07.831
That's what I do a lot during my day job.

24
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:10.991
Yeah, I have a lot of fun just
taking the things as I learned them,

25
00:01:10.991 --> 00:01:13.360
putting them together and
doing these workshops
