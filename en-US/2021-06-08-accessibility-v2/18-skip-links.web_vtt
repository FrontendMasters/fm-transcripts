00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.425
Next thing that we can do, it's a kind of
an advanced technique that can really help

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.300
people, are called skip links.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.776
And so the idea here being that
if you think about most sites,

4
00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:14.345
the way they're structured, there's
a really large navigation that remains

5
00:00:14.345 --> 00:00:17.296
ultimately the same on every single page,
right?

6
00:00:17.296 --> 00:00:20.097
Home, About, this, that,
the other thing, and

7
00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.000
then you have your
actual content under it.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.979
And so, when we're thinking about keyboard
only users, we can start thinking about,

9
00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:30.524
that's gonna get a little bit old if,
let's say, so you have 20 nav items,

10
00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:31.739
like you're a news site.

11
00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.555
Every single page they hit, they'll have
to hit Tab 21 times before there'll be

12
00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:37.720
able to get to the real content.

13
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.443
And so we do this kind of fun
technique called a skip link and

14
00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:42.290
I've got a couple of pictures of them.

15
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.002
So if you go to github.com and you hit
Tab, you'll get this blue button that

16
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:49.280
appears kinda out of nowhere and
says skip to content.

17
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.359
Similarly, on the newyorktimes.com,
if you hit Tab,

18
00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.410
you'll get this button that appears and
says skip to content.

19
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.531
And so the basic idea with a skip link is,
you make an anchor and

20
00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:01.430
you put skip to content or whatever
you want in the body of that anchor.

21
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.125
You prepend it to the body of your
websites, you stick it at the very,

22
00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:08.250
very beginning,
you can either do that with JavaScript or

23
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.343
just put it in the HTML if you
have a vanilla HTML website.

24
00:01:11.343 --> 00:01:15.030
You make it visually hidden like
we did in the second lesson.

25
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.937
And then with CSS,

26
00:01:15.937 --> 00:01:19.930
you give it a focused state that
makes it visually not hidden anymore.

27
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.598
And so, since it's an anchor,
it's tabbable,

28
00:01:22.598 --> 00:01:26.380
sighted users will not see it
because it's visually hidden.

29
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.680
When you hit Tab,
it is at the beginning of your website, so

30
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.260
it's the very first
thing that gets focused.

31
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.676
And then the very last thing is you want
the target of that anchor to be the main

32
00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:37.560
content.

33
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.288
And the way that you do that is you
just give the main content an id and

34
00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:46.940
then in your anchor you give it
a pound and then whatever the id is.

35
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.781
This is a common technique used for

36
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:53.270
single-page websites where you wanna be
able to scroll to places on the page.

37
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.839
So you'd have anchor and it'd be anchor
href, it'd be like pound Hello, and

38
00:01:57.839 --> 00:02:00.747
then under that you'd have
like h1 id Hello, and

39
00:02:00.747 --> 00:02:04.620
then the anchor that automatically
will link to each other.

40
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.785
We'll go through an example of it, but
that's the basic idea for a skip link.

41
00:02:07.785 --> 00:02:11.890
There's libraries out there that do it,
but they're easy to make on your own.

42
00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.065
And again, the kinda web aim stuff
here is that says, to be compliant,

43
00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:18.849
you should have a link to
skip the navigation and

44
00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.270
any other page elements that
are repeated across all pages, right?

45
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.054
So again, it's not every site but
most sites have a nav,

46
00:02:26.054 --> 00:02:30.650
you should have something at the beginning
that lets people skip right through it.

47
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.800
There's also some other stuff around here,

48
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.481
which is that page titles should be
descriptive, and the navigation of links

49
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:40.580
should be logical, but for right now we're
just focusing on skip links as a concept.
