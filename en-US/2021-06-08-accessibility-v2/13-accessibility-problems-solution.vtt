00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.710
Welcome back from exercise two.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.793
So I got some good feedback
during the break, though,

3
00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:06.440
kind of wanted to share
a couple of things.

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.024
First of all folks being a little
overwhelmed by the voice over or

5
00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:15.880
the screen reader utility, which I
completely understand it's system level.

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.328
So if you start doing something like
changing tabs or opening a new app,

7
00:00:19.328 --> 00:00:22.330
it just reads and reads and
reads at a very fast pace.

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.216
One thing to keep in mind for

9
00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:29.440
the Mac voiceover users that command
f5 will toggle voiceover on and off.

10
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.970
So if you need it off really quick,
you can do that.

11
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.492
You can also wear the gray boxes
reading the text, you can at any time,

12
00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:39.090
just click the X in the top left,
and that'll also turn voiceover off.

13
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.054
Another question about wanting to use
voiceover with just the visual and

14
00:00:45.054 --> 00:00:46.350
not the audio.

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.110
I'm not sure if there's a setting for it.

16
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.187
But one thing that I often do
since the visual is enough for

17
00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:53.697
me to test is I just turn
the sound off on my Mac.

18
00:00:53.697 --> 00:00:57.630
So I'm not listening to it, and
then just use the text to test things.

19
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.005
There are also settings where
you can change the voice and

20
00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:01.450
you can slow it down or speed it up.

21
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.169
So if you're doing heavy testing
with it and you're new to it.

22
00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:08.673
I would really recommend slowing the voice
down because it feels very overwhelming

23
00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:11.960
having someone talk at you very quickly
while you're trying to do stuff.

24
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.564
Cool, so for this exercise, I think the
way that I would normally just start it is

25
00:01:15.564 --> 00:01:18.108
by turning on my screen reader
just to kind of get a feel for

26
00:01:18.108 --> 00:01:19.129
what the site is like.

27
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.910
So, I'll use Command F5 to turn the screen
reader on, I use voiceover here.

28
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.176
And then I'll just kind of start
tabbing through a little bit,

29
00:01:27.176 --> 00:01:28.680
see what the interactive elements are.

30
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.880
So, I can kind of tap through and I see,
okay, we've got a link to this repo.

31
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.160
Then we've got some of these
dangerous form fields again,

32
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.670
like we had before they just say
Edit Text blank on them, Edit Text blank.

33
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.926
And then it just sort of moves on, so

34
00:01:43.926 --> 00:01:47.250
not super useful for
screenreader users right now.

35
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.440
So kind of with that information,
I'll hop over into the HTML.

36
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.310
So I'm gonna move over
into my text editor.

37
00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.260
And I'm just gonna close this and open to
the HTML here in the exercises folder.

38
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.610
So that's exercises 2 dot html.

39
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.370
And basically I just wanted to kind of
show the experience of the stuff that we

40
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.770
had looked at before.

41
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.656
So this sort of anti pattern of using
non labels to label your form fields.

42
00:02:12.656 --> 00:02:14.722
This anti pattern of using divs for

43
00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:18.550
buttons because they won't
be focused by the keyboard.

44
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.605
And this anti pattern of using
an image with no alt text so

45
00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:25.300
the screen reader doesn't
know what to do with it.

46
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.022
So yeah, for this one,
you can kind of do either the explicit or

47
00:02:29.022 --> 00:02:31.880
the implicit labels that I showed before.

48
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.080
So I like the implicit where you
just kind of wrap the input in it.

49
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.517
So I'll do like this and move it over,
and then provide a closing label tag.

50
00:02:40.517 --> 00:02:44.010
And I'll do the same thing for this one.

51
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.770
So label move this over and
then a closing label tag here.

52
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.670
For the class of button,
I will just get rid of this.

53
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.550
Use a button if possible.

54
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.358
And remember if you need to, you can feel
totally free to style buttons like you

55
00:03:00.358 --> 00:03:04.080
do not need to keep them gray with
their border or anything like that.

56
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.472
So you could easily do like a button
with a class of like my custom button,

57
00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:09.985
anything you want here.

58
00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:14.038
And you can reset all of those things
Porter, zero background inherit or

59
00:03:14.038 --> 00:03:16.040
whatever you can do all that stuff.

60
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.907
That's no problem at all but the button
is, what's gonna get you the focus and

61
00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:24.544
the key down and the tab index,
all those kinds of things.

62
00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:28.910
And then for this alt text here,
go ahead and add kitten.

63
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.020
I'll go ahead and save that.

64
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.570
Come back and refresh here.

65
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.180
And then just kind of F5
again to start screen reader.

66
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.231
And then just make sure that I got
these things kind of correct or

67
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.070
I've got everything that I
can just mess with here.

68
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.570
The question is like for the link, would
that be a good place to use an aria label?

69
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:49.860
And it's really interesting.

70
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.211
So, you've kind of have like two different
ways that screen reader users will

71
00:03:53.211 --> 00:03:54.930
interact with your site.

72
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.727
One way is that they'll just
load up the screen reader and

73
00:03:57.727 --> 00:04:00.090
let it just read the whole web page,
right.

74
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.942
And so when they're reading the web page,

75
00:04:01.942 --> 00:04:06.080
they'll get the same context that we'll
get like download the code for this repo.

76
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.892
But as you mentioned,
which I think is great,

77
00:04:08.892 --> 00:04:11.640
like these links will often do that,
right?

78
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.510
A link will text off and be click here,
and no context at all to it.

79
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.870
So, if you're tabbing through or if you
use that rotor that I showed earlier to

80
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.251
view all links on the site,
it's not super useful, right?

81
00:04:23.251 --> 00:04:25.180
It'll be like, click here,
click here, click here.

82
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.290
Those are the three links on the page.

83
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.067
So yeah, I do think that if you
wanted to go the extra mile,

84
00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.299
it would be great to add
labels to those links.

85
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.640
Just say aria label,
I got a mail, even do it now.

86
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.290
So we've got this here and
then we could just add

87
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.950
an aria label and
we could do I guess it is a link.

88
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:53.290
So it would be, get hub page for
repository or something like that.

89
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.950
Just so that it's got more context
to it than what the link is.

90
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:00.557
Another tool that we'll learn
about in another section is.

91
00:05:00.557 --> 00:05:04.442
Instead of labelling and describing,
aria also offers an API for

92
00:05:04.442 --> 00:05:07.770
describing which is more
like supplementary content.

93
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.930
So it's, hey, this thing is a button but
what it does is it takes you to this.

94
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.900
So it might be a good example for
describe as well.

95
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.515
But I think that's a really good point
that, we talked about images and

96
00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:20.246
form fields.

97
00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:22.712
But even links like if
the context isn't there,

98
00:05:22.712 --> 00:05:26.300
I think that's a great opportunity
to label them for sure.

99
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.162
So if you use a div with a role of
button and you do all the things,

100
00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.620
does it have a negative impact?

101
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.395
I would say no, but

102
00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:37.170
with a caveat that you have to make
sure you do all the things right.

103
00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.886
So, it's like the roll the tab
index the mouse down, and

104
00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:43.680
the key down sniffing for enter and space.

105
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.190
Make sure you do all of those things,
and then it'll perform the same way.

106
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.345
So, that's the cool thing is like Aria,

107
00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:51.881
which we're going to get
into the next section.

108
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:55.857
It really does let you control things
with the roles and with the labels and

109
00:05:55.857 --> 00:05:59.530
things like that it really can alter
the screen of your experience.

110
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.318
So yeah, you can definitely do it as long
as you're committed to making sure that

111
00:06:03.318 --> 00:06:05.338
you cover 100% of the functionality.

112
00:06:05.338 --> 00:06:08.460
Because sometimes things will
have just sneaky functionality,

113
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.970
like I didn't know about enter on
buttons for a really long time.

114
00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.440
I just like to click on.

115
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.747
So things like that can be missed,
but no as long as you commit to it,

116
00:06:15.747 --> 00:06:17.590
I think that's totally fine.

117
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.473
So these days is it better to use the nav
tag with anchors versus the old school

118
00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:25.920
style of using an unordered
list with our eyes.

119
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.385
Great question nav did you
know the nav does provide some

120
00:06:30.385 --> 00:06:32.670
semantic meaning for sure.

121
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.501
The important thing for sure is that the
things themselves are always wrapped in

122
00:06:38.501 --> 00:06:42.090
anchors like anything that takes
you to a new page is an anchor.

123
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:43.410
That's like the vital thing.

124
00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.959
I think for these tags that
provide semantic meaning, but

125
00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:52.660
don't provide functionality like nav, for
example, I don't think it's important.

126
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.820
I think it's fine to use an unordered list
but I would lean towards using these tags.

127
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.896
They have a lot of benefits in just
like search engines in general structure

128
00:07:02.896 --> 00:07:04.590
the page and things like that.

129
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.680
So I would prefer to use a nav.

130
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.211
But I think the only important thing,

131
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:12.790
I see a lot of confusion
between buttons and links.

132
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.286
So if you had buttons that
took you to different pages,

133
00:07:15.286 --> 00:07:19.470
that would be bad because buttons are
supposed to be interactivity on a page.

134
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.419
So as long as their anchor tags I
think it's fine either way, but yeah,

135
00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.190
it's a great question.

136
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:28.279
Are there differences between what we're
doing today, which is just vanilla HTML,

137
00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:31.540
versus how would you do this with
a framework react or Angular view?

138
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.760
So for all intents and purposes, right?

139
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.620
All of these things are supported through
the frameworks in the exact same way.

140
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.410
Although we sort of know from other things
when we're using a framework that uses JSX

141
00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.630
as an example react.

142
00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:50.390
They don't support the data
properties in the same way.

143
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.037
So I would have to look it up, but

144
00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:55.990
I would assume some of the aria tags
might be camel cased instead of dashed.

145
00:07:55.990 --> 00:08:01.335
Similarly, a lot of other properties are.

146
00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:03.860
A lot of the dashes get turned
into camel case things in JSX.

147
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:07.729
So you might you would have to look up
specifically does Aria dash label work or

148
00:08:07.729 --> 00:08:10.299
would it be Aria label all
one word with a capital L.

149
00:08:10.299 --> 00:08:13.532
But as far as support goes,
they'll be the same they'll be the exact

150
00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:17.125
same in the sense that you'll just apply
them directly to the element that.

151
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:20.525
Even if it's a virtual DOM element,
but for sure if it's JSX,

152
00:08:20.525 --> 00:08:23.130
then there might be syntax difference.

153
00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:26.266
And so yeah, so we talked about
anchors being page to page,

154
00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:29.678
buttons being something on the page,
but what about examples?

155
00:08:29.678 --> 00:08:34.052
If you have a form and you have a submit
button, but when you submit the button,

156
00:08:34.052 --> 00:08:35.260
you get redirected.

157
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.020
Is there any way to tell the user hey,
you're going to get taken somewhere else?

158
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.590
So there absolutely is.

159
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.760
Within Aria, there are roles
that you can add to things.

160
00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.484
And you got a bunch of cool roles
like has transition or has pop up or

161
00:08:48.484 --> 00:08:49.518
has navigation.

162
00:08:49.518 --> 00:08:53.950
These different things where you can
let the user know, hey, It's a button.

163
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.560
It's what you think is a submit button.

164
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.470
But we're gonna do something here or
similarly, hey, it's a button.

165
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.530
The label of the button is register for
an account, but it has Aria has pop up.

166
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:08.410
So also know that when you click the
button, you'll be taken to a new modal.

167
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.810
So that's a great question.

168
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.880
I'll cover in the next section.

169
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.656
But yeah, Aria has these abilities to
let users know what the role is or

170
00:09:14.656 --> 00:09:16.710
what experience is going to happen.

171
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.710
So yeah, awesome question.
