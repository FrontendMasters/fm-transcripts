00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.157
Let's go through Exercise 1 together.

2
00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:07.427
So I'm on a Mac, so I already have voice
over installed and I'll use that for

3
00:00:07.427 --> 00:00:08.740
this demo.

4
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.724
I'm not gonna dim my screen
because I'm presenting, but

5
00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:19.940
we can use the bottom left gray area
to see kind of what I would be hearing.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.220
So I'll enable voice over, use voice over.

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.410
And so kinda here we are.

8
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.910
I'm in this Chrome tab.

9
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.350
And so
even without being able to visually see,

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.104
I can tab one since as basic commands.

11
00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:37.852
I'll link JAWS, I'll link NVDA,
I'll link Chrome Screen Reader,

12
00:00:37.852 --> 00:00:40.940
and then I get into this form and
it says favorite color.

13
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.740
I don't know, I'm gonna go purple.

14
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.720
And then it says first name,
John, last name, Kuperman.

15
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.173
Age, how old am I?

16
00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:53.380
33 maybe, and then submit button.

17
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.256
And so yeah, I just kind of wanted people
to get kind of a little bit of familiarity

18
00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:59.650
with, yeah,
what what that experience is like.

19
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.656
And like what it might be like filling
out a form or something like that, or

20
00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:08.210
navigating through some links with
just the screen reader alone.

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.988
I'm gonna go ahead and
turn off the screen reader for now, and

22
00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:12.760
we'll cover this in the next section.

23
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.228
But I did wanna just kinda bring up, so

24
00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:19.641
the reason that these work is because
they are labeled form fields.

25
00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:21.567
And that's something that we're gonna be
talking about in the very next section.

26
00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:25.834
But that's why the screen reader knows
exactly what content to tell you to put

27
00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:26.430
in there.
