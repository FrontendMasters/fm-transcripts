1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.167
So for our next exercise,

2
00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:06.320
this will be the first one messing
with the code a little bit.

3
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.380
Again, it's totally optional,
I have a link here to the repo.

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.597
We've got this file exercises2.html.

5
00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.879
And then we've got just a bunch of mark
up that's got some issues with it that we

6
00:00:17.879 --> 00:00:19.230
recently covered.

7
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.854
And so, if we could do just a little break
to kinda work through some of these things

8
00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:25.387
and then I'll come back and
work through them as a group.

9
00:00:25.387 --> 00:00:29.337
It also might be cool if you did set up
a screen reader from exercise 1 to use

10
00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:32.141
the screen reader on the content
as it is right now and

11
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:33.832
see how difficult it is to use.

12
00:00:33.832 --> 00:00:37.534
And then as you fix it, know that you're
fixing it well, by using a screen reader.

13
00:00:37.534 --> 00:00:39.420
That's what we'll do together
when we come back from them.
