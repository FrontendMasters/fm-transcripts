1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.109
I wanted to cover this thing called the
curb cut effect, which is something that

2
00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:07.612
I'm kinda fascinated with and
I hope I don't get the details wrong, but

3
00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:10.210
it's a kind of an anecdotal
story that I really like.

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.874
So it's back in Berkeley, California,
I think in the 1950s, and so

5
00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:19.615
a little bit before that, I think in
the 1940s, laws had started being

6
00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:24.660
passed throughout the United States saying
that buildings and a lot of parks and

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.010
recreation places needed to meet some
sort of accessibility standard, right.

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.962
They needed to have ramps and rails and
certain access for certain things.

9
00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:37.288
It'd become really great, but
at the time when you're out and

10
00:00:37.288 --> 00:00:41.010
about on the street and
the sidewalks, it didn't apply there.

11
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.619
And so pretty much across the entire
country at the time curbs

12
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:49.088
did not have ramps like we know them
to have today, they just had drop offs.

13
00:00:49.088 --> 00:00:51.104
I mean you still see that some places,

14
00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:54.132
a curb will just kind of end
instead of having a nice ramp.

15
00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:59.082
And so this disability rights advocate
in Berkeley, and I'm trying to remember

16
00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:03.737
exactly what he did, but I think he went
out on his wheelchair with cement and

17
00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:08.364
just dumped cement on a curb somewhere
in Berkeley so that it became a ramp.

18
00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:12.518
And it was this free speech, this
expressive movement where he was like,

19
00:01:12.518 --> 00:01:16.873
I'm just sick of not being able to use
this curb because people in a wheelchair

20
00:01:16.873 --> 00:01:21.550
can't just, or it's a giant jump down and
it's very difficult to get up.

21
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.084
So he does this thing and it gets all
this publicity, should he be arrested,

22
00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:27.253
was it illegal,
all these different things.

23
00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:31.065
And ends up spawning this movement of
more and more folks start doing this,

24
00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:34.999
kinda going out and adding these ramps
of some sort, either pouring cement or

25
00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:36.586
setting up a ramp or whatever.

26
00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:38.759
And this really interesting thing happens,

27
00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.018
it starts off as this very particular
disability rights movement,

28
00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:45.280
wheelchair users wanting ramps so
they can get around.

29
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.231
And what folks all over the country
started observing is how many people start

30
00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:50.620
using these ramps.

31
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.850
And so you're seeing all these
parents pushing strollers, bicyclists,

32
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.000
skateboarders, workers pushing
heavy equipment on wheels.

33
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.115
All these people start immensely
benefiting from this thing, and

34
00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:05.507
it spreads like wildfire, and
these ramps, these curb cutting ramps,

35
00:02:05.507 --> 00:02:09.540
take off all over the country and
eventually become the absolute standard.

36
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.877
And the kinda anecdote there, what the
curb cut effect is is that often times if

37
00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:18.411
not all the time, when you build something
to make your application, your site or

38
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:22.878
whatever you're working on, easier for
people with disabilities, you almost

39
00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:27.310
always end up making it a lot easier and
a lot more enjoyable for everyone to use.

40
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.670
We see this in the physical world,
we see this in the digital world.

41
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.396
These things that get put up for
folks with disabilities, ramps, railing,

42
00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:38.378
keyboard shortcuts,
better structured HTML,

43
00:02:38.378 --> 00:02:43.340
all of these things that start off one
way, end up really benefiting everybody.

44
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.080
So I think that's a very cool effect that
I've seen firsthand a lot of times where

45
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.985
I'll build something, an accessibility
feature, and then I'll often hear about

46
00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:54.920
folks that just are power users of
the website getting a big kick out of it.

47
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.454
At what point in the software
lifecycle should you be thinking about

48
00:02:58.454 --> 00:03:02.435
accessibility in individual design,
in development, things like that?

49
00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:06.327
That's great, I think the best case
scenario is thinking about different

50
00:03:06.327 --> 00:03:08.230
things at different points.

51
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.395
And so, for example, at Adobe I
would often during the design phase,

52
00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:15.710
there are certain things
that I would push back on.

53
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.022
Like, hey, this experience
is gonna be really tough for

54
00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:22.962
people with disabilities to use,
is it important, is it worth it?

55
00:03:22.962 --> 00:03:26.632
Is it worth the effort that's gonna
go into making it accessible or

56
00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:29.198
is it something that we
can kind of do without?

57
00:03:29.198 --> 00:03:32.773
Other things too, like making
sure the designs are well spaced,

58
00:03:32.773 --> 00:03:34.788
like buttons are well spaced apart so

59
00:03:34.788 --> 00:03:39.530
folks without perfect dexterity can
easily target them and things like that.

60
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.268
So there's some things for sure design
considerations, and if nothing else,

61
00:03:43.268 --> 00:03:46.336
trying to be aware of what will be
a development consideration and

62
00:03:46.336 --> 00:03:47.950
bringing that up early.

63
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.095
And then during the development stage,
I think, yeah, it's absolutely vital.

64
00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:53.743
I think maybe multiple passes.

65
00:03:53.743 --> 00:03:58.757
There's a lot of stuff that should just
be foundational that we'll cover today,

66
00:03:58.757 --> 00:04:02.099
like using the right HTML elements or
things to avoid or

67
00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.967
where you should add certain
ARIA labels which we'll get int.

68
00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:09.852
And then there's other things too, which
is maybe after you've built it you really

69
00:04:09.852 --> 00:04:13.320
wanna get in there and try it or
do some real user testing.

70
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.736
And so
I think maybe a three phased approach,

71
00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:18.789
bring up a lot of main concerns
during the design phase for

72
00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.008
during the initial development build,
build it with accessibility in mind.

73
00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:26.017
And then always have some time for
accessibility testing,

74
00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:28.241
much in the same way you
would do QA testing,

75
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.620
have some accessibility testing to make
sure that the things work as expected.

76
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.170
Does adding accessibility
information help with SEO?

77
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.784
It's really interesting,
so some things absolutely.

78
00:04:38.784 --> 00:04:43.485
So one thing that we're gonna cover in
the next section is using semantic HTML

79
00:04:43.485 --> 00:04:44.680
properly.

80
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.485
And things like that, a well structured
page with well structured headings and

81
00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:51.891
the proper tags, can absolutely
help your site vitals, your health,

82
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.510
things like that.

83
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.525
On the other hand,
there's one area where we fight,

84
00:04:56.525 --> 00:05:00.425
where accessibility engineers and
SEO engineers disagree.

85
00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:04.435
So that would be, and we'll cover this,
that would be image alternative text.

86
00:05:04.435 --> 00:05:08.946
So SEO users see the alternative text
as a great chance to keyword stuff for

87
00:05:08.946 --> 00:05:11.435
the keywords that they want to rank for.

88
00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:15.724
So cheap student loans or something like
that, regardless of what the picture is.

89
00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:18.532
The picture could be a cat or
a kid graduating college and

90
00:05:18.532 --> 00:05:20.339
they'll say cheap student loans.

91
00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:24.951
And accessibility engineers know that that
text is the only signal that non-sighted

92
00:05:24.951 --> 00:05:29.497
users will get from screen readers, and so
they really want it to be descriptive, so

93
00:05:29.497 --> 00:05:30.926
kid graduating college.

94
00:05:30.926 --> 00:05:33.663
So yes and no I guess is the answer.

95
00:05:33.663 --> 00:05:37.882
In some ways, absolutely aligned,
in one particular way,

96
00:05:37.882 --> 00:05:40.542
absolutely on kinda opposite sides.

97
00:05:40.542 --> 00:05:47.170
And that comes Google starting to crawl
images and look at that text for a signal.

98
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.880
And so then SEO folks kinda
jumping on that and being like,

99
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.490
let's jam all of our keywords into that
and hope that we rank higher for that.
