00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.346
The first exercise is just
installing a screen reader and

2
00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:05.865
getting comfortable navigating around.

3
00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.604
So, again, I put the links in chat for

4
00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:13.154
where the site is, I'm gonna
click on here just to show folks.

5
00:00:13.154 --> 00:00:18.026
So, the idea for the exercise is
we have this form down here, and

6
00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:24.268
what I would like folks to do if they're
interested is to install a screen reader.

7
00:00:24.268 --> 00:00:28.600
Turn it on, dim the brightness on
your monitor or look away, and

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.891
with just the audio cues
from the screen reader,

9
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:36.968
can you figure out what each field in
this form is and can you enter in there?

10
00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:40.933
So you can use tab to go through each one,
right, and when you tab through them

11
00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:44.898
with your screen reader on you should
get some context for what goes in there.

12
00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:46.946
So, yeah, let's take a break here,

13
00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.594
anybody have any questions before
we get started on the exercise and

14
00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:54.186
then we'll meet back up and
I'll do the exercise with everybody.

15
00:00:54.186 --> 00:01:00.051
Is it possible to analyze a user uploaded
image to make dynamic alternative text,

16
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:03.536
absolutely, it is, but
I think both Twitter and

17
00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:06.522
Facebook do this at least Facebook does.

18
00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:09.976
They use I actually don't know
how it works, but I think they

19
00:01:09.976 --> 00:01:14.269
have like some machine learning that
runs on the images as you upload them.

20
00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:18.159
And does that they even do things
like I noticed recently if you upload

21
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.984
an image with like hot button words
in it like Coronavirus vaccine,

22
00:01:21.984 --> 00:01:25.338
they will put their interstitial
warning that says, hey,

23
00:01:25.338 --> 00:01:28.654
check out the official docs,
even if it's just an image.

24
00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:33.017
So, yeah, a lot of the big companies will
automate automatically generate alt text

25
00:01:33.017 --> 00:01:34.991
dynamically, which is really cool.

26
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:37.321
But it's also worth
noting like on Twitter,

27
00:01:37.321 --> 00:01:40.770
you can enable the ability to
override that with your own alt text.

28
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.410
So, as you upload your image,
you can put alt text on it,

29
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.781
which is kind of cool, well, yeah,
but yeah, it's a great question.

30
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:51.032
So yeah, is it is it different a div with
a background image versus an image tag,

31
00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:52.052
it absolutely is.

32
00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:56.826
So, the screen readers will view the image
tag as content that needs to be read

33
00:01:56.826 --> 00:01:57.349
aloud.

34
00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:59.518
They will ignore CSS background images,
so,

35
00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:03.144
if you have a div with a background image,
it will not read on a screen reader.

36
00:02:03.144 --> 00:02:04.780
So yeah, it absolutely is a difference.
