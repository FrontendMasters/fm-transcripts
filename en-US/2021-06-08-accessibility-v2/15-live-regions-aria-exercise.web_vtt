00:00:00.304 --> 00:00:04.127
One of my favorite ones is live regions,
another part of the ARIA spec.

2
00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:05.553
So you can kind of imagine,

3
00:00:05.553 --> 00:00:08.660
a lot of the apps we're building
are very dynamic, right?

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.670
They're not just a flat page
with flat content on them.

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.497
And so for these cases,
it's a little bit tricky.

6
00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:18.712
So we've seen the screen reader just
kinda read the whole page aloud.

7
00:00:18.712 --> 00:00:21.521
And we've seen the screen reader
navigate through the page like,

8
00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.592
let me see all the links, let me see
all the headings, let me find a form.

9
00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:27.121
But what about applications
where something updates and

10
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:29.340
you kinda need to catch
the attention of the user?

11
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.161
For example, a sidebar loads in,
or you have a notification, or

12
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:36.854
somebody leaves a comment on your post or
something like that.

13
00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:39.152
Or the Uber app is a really good example,
right?

14
00:00:39.152 --> 00:00:42.638
So you're on the app and
there's a button that says book ride, and

15
00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:44.578
so the screen reader reads that out.

16
00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:47.078
You're like, okay, hit the button,
it looks the ride.

17
00:00:47.078 --> 00:00:50.968
So the status is waiting for a driver,
something like that, or waiting for

18
00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:52.223
a ride, I don't know.

19
00:00:52.223 --> 00:00:55.398
But at some amount of time,
totally undetermined,

20
00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:59.162
it'll change to driver en route,
ten minutes away, right?

21
00:00:59.162 --> 00:01:02.521
And if one of the users already passed it,
which they almost certainly will be,

22
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.330
how do you alert the user
that something's changed?

23
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.162
And so to do that,
we have ARIA live regions.

24
00:01:08.162 --> 00:01:10.574
They're, again, very easy to implement.

25
00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:13.100
You can just put ARIA live on something.

26
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.648
And then whenever the inside content
of that HTML element changes,

27
00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:20.059
it'll reread it aloud to the user.

28
00:01:20.059 --> 00:01:24.650
And we've got two choices when doing this.

29
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.870
This is one of my favorite
APIs in all of web.

30
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.299
The value for ARIA live is
called the politeness setting.

31
00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.086
I just really like the name of that.

32
00:01:34.086 --> 00:01:37.395
So you can either pass in assertive or
polite.

33
00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:40.500
You could pass in off, but
that's the same as just not adding it.

34
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.327
So assertive means no matter what
the screen reader is doing, stop it and

35
00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:46.659
announce that an update has happened here.

36
00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.079
Polite means let the screen reader finish,
and the next time it hits an idle cycle,

37
00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.420
announce it to the user.

38
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.650
So you can kinda use that
at your own judgment.

39
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.540
If your ride is here, that's probably
the most important thing, so go assertive.

40
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.484
If some content is loaded or
maybe they have a notification,

41
00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:03.226
I would probably make that polite.

42
00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:06.501
So they can finish reading the current
posts before they hear about

43
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:07.502
the notification.

44
00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:11.032
So these have a wide range of uses.

45
00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:14.194
Some folks go a little bit
overboard with them, cuz you gotta

46
00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:18.040
remember that this is an interruption,
for sure it's an interruption.

47
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.531
So I would say only use it when
an interruption is necessary, worthwhile,

48
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:23.683
that kinda thing.

49
00:02:23.683 --> 00:02:26.875
But I really like the polite setting
where you can just kind of think

50
00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:27.903
of it as a cue almost.

51
00:02:27.903 --> 00:02:31.196
And you're like, hey, next time,
the screen reader is done, let the user

52
00:02:31.196 --> 00:02:34.651
know they have a notification or they have
a new comment or something like that.

53
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:39.148
For any important things, you have
your ride is here or, I don't know,

54
00:02:39.148 --> 00:02:43.574
the shopper is checked out,
anything like that for these modern apps,

55
00:02:43.574 --> 00:02:45.525
assertive can be a lot better.

56
00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:50.584
So what I've done here for exercise
three is we've got this number here and

57
00:02:50.584 --> 00:02:54.539
it's incrementing at
a semi-random interval, right?

58
00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:58.380
Because it's basically like you've made a
viral post and it's getting very popular.

59
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.620
Endorphins should be going.

60
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.640
So this is in 3.html, and the exercise is,

61
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.400
can you use live regions
to control this area?

62
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.716
And then to turn your screen reader on and
listen to it as it comes in.

63
00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:15.047
And then if you would like, notice
how the difference between polite and

64
00:03:15.047 --> 00:03:17.020
assertive kinda changes the experience.

65
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.260
So yeah, so
we can take a quick break here.

66
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.458
And then when we come back,
we'll kinda go over it together and

67
00:03:22.458 --> 00:03:24.460
we'll play with the screen
reader to kinda listen to it.
