And so, if we could do just a little break to kinda work through some of these things and then I'll come back and work through them as a group. It also might be cool if you did set up a screen reader from exercise 1 to use the screen reader on the content as it is right now and see how difficult it is to use.

And then as you fix it, know that you're fixing it well, by using a screen reader. That's what we'll do together when we come back from them.
