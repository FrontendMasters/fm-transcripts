1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.753
And then, yeah,

2
00:00:00.753 --> 00:00:03.583
the last thing I just kinda wanted
to cover is where to go from here.

3
00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:06.954
Just I've compiled a list of
resources that I really like.

4
00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:11.340
&gt;&gt; The first two are just the things
that we linked to, so WCAG and WebAIM.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.186
Some companies just do
these awesome things.

6
00:00:13.186 --> 00:00:18.530
Microsoft has this inclusive design
page that I just absolutely love.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.774
So it talks about like their whole
methodology and all their principles,

8
00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:26.590
how they think about building
accessible experiences.

9
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.692
They have their own list of resources,
what they do at their company,

10
00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:34.666
what they do with AI, what they do
with design, it's so well done.

11
00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:41.936
And at the bottom somewhere they
have personas which I quite like.

12
00:00:41.936 --> 00:00:43.830
I'll have to find it,
it's buried in here somewhere.

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.060
But anyway, this homepage microsoft.com/
design/inclusive is so well written.

14
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.309
I've always just considered it a leader in
the space where they just talk about all

15
00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.412
their principles and things like that.

16
00:00:55.412 --> 00:01:00.804
Another one that's really cool is,
where is it?

17
00:01:00.804 --> 00:01:03.340
It's in 21 days and
we're coming up on this thing.

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.851
So there's Global Accessibility
Awareness Day, which is really cool.

19
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:10.330
So it's like a kinda conference thing,
it's completely free.

20
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.238
We see a lot of familiar names,
like WebAIM is in there presenting.

21
00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:16.410
It's so awesome.

22
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.166
So I think one of my favorite things too,
I should have put it on the list at

23
00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:24.180
the beginning, is that the accessibility
community is the best community.

24
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.744
People are just so nice,
everyone's kinda learning together.

25
00:01:27.744 --> 00:01:32.780
One thing I like about it is it's so
diverse where there's a lot of product

26
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.430
folks, a lot of designers,
a lot of developers, a lot of testers.

27
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.000
It's a lot of CSS folks,
a lot of JavaScript folks,

28
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.120
everybody's kind of working together
on this stuff so it's really cool.

29
00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.220
So yeah, definitely recommend checking out
this Global Accessibility Awareness Day.

30
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.626
Also got some cool courses
that teach things.

31
00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:56.532
There's a Frontend Master's course
by Marcy Sutton on accessibility in

32
00:01:56.532 --> 00:01:58.050
JavaScript applications.

33
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.557
So she dives into a lot more within
Javascript app stuff which is great.

34
00:02:02.557 --> 00:02:06.256
She's been a leader in the community for
a long time.

35
00:02:06.256 --> 00:02:09.305
And then there's some other links for
just some tips and tricks and

36
00:02:09.305 --> 00:02:12.301
how to get started with building
accessible web applications and

37
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.606
stuff like that, so
just some resources to have.
