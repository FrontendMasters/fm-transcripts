00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.209
ARIA live,
is there any way to have a sound play?

2
00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.230
I, there is I just don't think there's
anything that ARIA would do to help.

3
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.210
So I think that trying to think
of the best way to do it.

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.454
Like basically, I think you would just
have to do it with JavaScript and

5
00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:18.740
with some kind of Audio API.

6
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.496
So you could like Listen for a change
event on the container you can make

7
00:00:23.496 --> 00:00:27.940
a sound at that point which I
actually think would be really cool.

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.187
I'm pretty sure Facebook does that.

9
00:00:31.187 --> 00:00:34.192
I think if you have like your sound on and
you get a notification.

10
00:00:34.192 --> 00:00:37.693
I'm not sure if they do it, but for sure
like some chat applications do it where

11
00:00:37.693 --> 00:00:41.250
when something comes in,
you get a notification sound.

12
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.288
So yeah, you there definitely is you
could set up like a watcher on that.

13
00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:47.570
And then Trigger some kind of audio,
but not with the ARIA spec.

14
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.240
There's no way to do it with that.

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.750
Yeah, that's a really good question.

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.482
So yeah,
if you have an existing code base, yeah,

17
00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:55.400
like sort of how do you get started?

18
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.460
What's the best practice
to get started with things?

19
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.664
I do think that, there's a few different
approaches, like I think that one.

20
00:01:03.664 --> 00:01:08.113
And we'll get into tooling
in the next [COUGH] segment.

21
00:01:08.113 --> 00:01:11.336
But for example, Chrome Dev Tools,
inside lighthouse,

22
00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.920
there's an accessibility order.

23
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.533
So like one place I might get started is
just doing that order which will give you

24
00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:19.907
a very high level view of
some of the bigger things.

25
00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:22.390
And then turning those into tickets and
working on them.

26
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.711
For sure, like the question mentioned
a few specific things like looking for

27
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.750
ARIA tags or alt text,
or things like that.

28
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.720
For that I would recommend setting
up a linter for it if possible.

29
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.798
So like es lint has some
accessibility plugins and react, and

30
00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.980
angular both have accessibility plugins.

31
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.420
So have you set that up then in your
editor as you're working on new files,

32
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.650
it would just flag those.

33
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.511
And be like, hey,
this image doesn't have all text or like,

34
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:50.890
hey this modal doesn't have,
has popped up on it.

35
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.228
So maybe coming at it from both of
those approaches at a basic linter and

36
00:01:55.228 --> 00:01:58.930
then also maybe manually
do a lighthouse run and.

37
00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.390
Make some tickets out of that.

38
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.409
And then kind of as it evolved.

39
00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.847
I think with a lot of those things,
especially in big code bases,

40
00:02:04.847 --> 00:02:09.240
like it's just not feasible to do like a
gigantic refactor of your whole code base.

41
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.218
So with a thing like the linter, it's only
maybe going to flag on files changed,

42
00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:15.110
or whatever.

43
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.672
So kind of setting up a culture of like,
hey, when you're in a file,

44
00:02:17.672 --> 00:02:19.180
fix any things that are there.

45
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.870
I'm creating new components going
forward try to adhere to these rules.

46
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.560
So, yeah I think those would be two
kind of good approaches for it.

47
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.188
There's depending on your company and
their budget.

48
00:02:29.188 --> 00:02:33.028
There's like really nice resources that
I'll link to in a little bit that do

49
00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:35.040
accessibility audits for you.

50
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.982
They'll give you like a big spreadsheet of
all the things, but I think starting out

51
00:02:38.982 --> 00:02:41.810
the lighthouse running a linter
is really good first step.
