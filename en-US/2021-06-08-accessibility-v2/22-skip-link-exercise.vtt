00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.010
So on to the next exercise.

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.290
So this one we're gonna
be making a skip link.

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.037
So basically what we're doing
here is we want to make it so

4
00:00:08.037 --> 00:00:12.267
that as a user starts tabbing they
don't have to like right now.

5
00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:16.190
If I to start tabbing I got
the answers branch out.

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.931
If I start tabbing, I'll have to go
through this entire navigation before I

7
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:22.320
can get to the main content down here.

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.670
And so we wanna do is we wanna add
something like I have done here.

9
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.525
Where when you hit tab the first
time a button appears and

10
00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:30.380
lets you skip to main content.

11
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.910
So if I hit Enter on that it
immediately focuses me down here.

12
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.910
And let's not worry too much about
the visual styling or anything like that.

13
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.010
But we'll take 10 minutes and
we'll work on it.

14
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:46.285
I do have at a high level,
I have the idea for a skip link.

15
00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:48.330
Let me find my notes here, done out here.

16
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.662
And so basically just following this, but
in some HTML, so making the anchor and

17
00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:52.691
doing things like that.

18
00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:55.590
And then we'll come back and
I'll do it all together for us.
