1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.283
The last thing for this section that
I wanted to cover is the standard.

2
00:00:03.283 --> 00:00:07.961
So for folks that have done any digging
into CSS spec, JavaScript spec,

3
00:00:07.961 --> 00:00:11.170
HTML spec,
these things always have groups.

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.090
They're all part of the W3.

5
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.111
They have these working
groups where things have to

6
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.351
go through the process of committee,
get decided on.

7
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:23.660
All the major browsers weigh in,
all these very process heavy thing.

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.270
Accessibility is no different.

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.820
So they have the Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines or WCAG.

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.740
And so WCAG,
that's the entire spec, right?

11
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.193
That's gonna be like,
here are the requirements or

12
00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:37.210
here's what makes a good accessible app.

13
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.330
Here are different rule sets,
all these different things.

14
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.900
They also provide, which is maybe more
helpful, three conformance levels.

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.785
And this is something that we're
gonna see kind of as a theme

16
00:00:46.785 --> 00:00:47.660
throughout the workshop.

17
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.530
So there's A, AA, and AAA.

18
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.630
And so AAA is the absolute
highest compliance level.

19
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.186
That would be, if you think of an example,
say you have an app where you let users

20
00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:01.520
kinda draw with their mouse or
something like that.

21
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.154
Then maybe A would be just some
description around it saying, hey,

22
00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:08.040
this is an area for
mouse only users to be able to draw.

23
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.617
And maybe AA would be a description and
then the ability to do a little bit,

24
00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:15.387
like maybe tab through some of the options
and add things with your keyboard.

25
00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:18.726
And then AAA would be figuring out
maybe using the arrow keys for

26
00:01:18.726 --> 00:01:22.510
a fully robust way of doing the same
thing, but with the keyboard only.

27
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.657
And so we'll see this a lot with very
specific examples where we'll do

28
00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:31.810
an example on forms and we'll see well
what makes you A compliant, AA, and AAA.

29
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.815
And so when doing accessibility
work like contract work,

30
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.850
often clients will have their
requirement to be AA compliant.

31
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850
And you'll have to kinda know
how to look those things up.

32
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.970
So we'll go over that.

33
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.222
The problem with these specs is
they're really tough to parse, right?

34
00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:48.890
They're big, they're wordy.

35
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.818
They're very much designed by committee.

36
00:01:50.818 --> 00:01:52.980
They're a little bit hard to understand.

37
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.220
And so there's this really
cool group called WebAIM.

38
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.570
And WebAIM is an org that provides again,
not the official spec, but

39
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.820
they provide a really nice user-friendly
checklist with their recommendation.

40
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.518
So let me open this checklist just so
we can kind of get a feel for it.

41
00:02:10.518 --> 00:02:14.980
This is
webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist.

42
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.464
And so we'll kind of see,
if we scroll down a little bit,

43
00:02:18.464 --> 00:02:23.561
that they have these little sections like
text alternatives for non text content.

44
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:26.592
And then they'll say, images,
form image buttons and

45
00:02:26.592 --> 00:02:30.150
image map hot spots have
appropriate alternative text.

46
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.880
And then next to it over here, they'll
say what level of compliance that is.

47
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.262
So this is just level A compliance and
there is no AA or AAA,

48
00:02:37.262 --> 00:02:40.851
whereas we'll see for
some of these down here, we'll see for

49
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:44.090
an example here transcripts for
non-live audio.

50
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.450
There's a level A compliance, so
a transcript has to be there.

51
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.617
And then there's level AA,
synchronized captions are provided.

52
00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:55.116
And then there's AAA,
a sign language video is provided, so

53
00:02:55.116 --> 00:02:56.746
you can kind of understand.

54
00:02:56.746 --> 00:03:00.029
I hope that illustrates a good example of,

55
00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:05.270
okay, so WCAG specifies what you need for
audio and for video.

56
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.213
And then WCAG also specifies
the three conformance levels.

57
00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:13.434
And WebAIM tries to do a really nice job
of just kinda distilling that into easy to

58
00:03:13.434 --> 00:03:14.890
use, easy to read things.

59
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.364
And so a note on this course says
as we go through the things,

60
00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:22.195
I'll be using the WebAIM checklist for
each thing that we learn.

61
00:03:22.195 --> 00:03:26.248
So we'll learn about alternative text and
then we'll use the checklist to see, okay,

62
00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:28.350
what are the levels of conformance for
that?

63
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.610
&gt;&gt; What is UC?

64
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.170
&gt;&gt; It's a university.

65
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.620
I grabbed this quote because I really
liked it from University of California.

66
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.630
Sorry about that.

67
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.570
And then I think that was just
a little bit of an error on my part.

68
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.580
Yes, I grabbed this quote because I
really liked the explanation of ranges,

69
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.744
A, AA, and AAA.

70
00:03:51.744 --> 00:03:55.390
I think they're referencing themselves
in here as University of California.

71
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.700
Sorry about that.

72
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.751
&gt;&gt; What is Aria?

73
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:00.660
&gt;&gt; Aria, we have a full section on it.

74
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.910
But that's a great question.

75
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.930
What is Aria?

76
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.615
So HTML provides a fair amount of
things to make things accessible but

77
00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:11.650
there are limitations,
which we'll hit later.

78
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.010
ARIA is a W3 spec as well.

79
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.120
It's in the same kinda group that do HTML,
CSS and JavaScript.

80
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.060
And they are accessible
ability focused helpers.

81
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.620
So for example, an image would have
a source and an alt attribute.

82
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.910
But if you needed to do something like
label it, you could use aria-label.

83
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.190
And we'll cover examples of that.

84
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.220
But basically they're additive to the HTML
spec, and they work in all browsers.

85
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.841
And they're things that help
specifically with accessibility.

86
00:04:41.841 --> 00:04:45.137
So labeling,
telling what the role of something is,

87
00:04:45.137 --> 00:04:50.000
like if we're using a div as a button
is a common accessibility example.

88
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.811
There's a role attribute, which is part
of Aria to say, hey, screen readers,

89
00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:55.110
this is actually a button.

90
00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.130
So it's a big suite of helpers that are
all in HTML to help with accessibility.

91
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.765
And it's Accessible Rich Internet
Applications, but yeah, it's a spec for

92
00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:06.960
accessibility helping.
