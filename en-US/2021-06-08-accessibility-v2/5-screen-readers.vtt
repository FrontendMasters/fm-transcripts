1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.830
And then our next section
is on screen readers.

2
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.050
And what we're kind of trying to cover
here is an understanding of what they are.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.426
I had to read about screen readers quite
a lot when I was starting my experience,

4
00:00:11.426 --> 00:00:15.820
being a developer, and I literally for
years had no idea what they really were.

5
00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.827
I remember like reading CSS tricks,
articles about screen readers, and

6
00:00:18.827 --> 00:00:21.543
thinking that They were like a type
of iPad or something like that,

7
00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:22.870
that I just didn't know about.

8
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.730
I didn't have or whatever.

9
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.290
So yeah, I think the goal of this section
is to learn what screen readers are.

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.558
Look at the diversity of screen readers
because there are a lot of different ones

11
00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:33.180
and that provides a few issues.

12
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.572
And then for anybody interested getting
you set up with a screen reader on your

13
00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:39.962
computer, and just to mess around with it
a little bit to get a better idea more

14
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:42.660
empathy of what that experience is like.

15
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.339
So what are screen readers?

16
00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:49.160
There are software that convert
digital text into synthesized speech.

17
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.196
So again, it's software that you would
open that will read aloud the content of

18
00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:57.410
your web browser, your mobile app,
a desktop app, anything like that.

19
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.512
So they're often built in either
into the operating system or

20
00:01:00.512 --> 00:01:03.460
software that runs on
an operating system level.

21
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.100
And they help folks that are blind,
be able to parse and process and

22
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.990
understand these apps.

23
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.121
One thing that's really interesting about
them as we get started is I often find

24
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:16.574
when I was getting started that I
had to really slow the voice down so

25
00:01:16.574 --> 00:01:20.519
I could kind of understand what was going
on and If you ever get a chance to meet

26
00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:25.021
a user who uses a screen reader full time,
it's amazingly impressive how quickly they

27
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.783
listen to the audio cues, they're very
much able to use the mobile app or

28
00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:32.361
desktop app at really blazing fast
speeds because they've gotten so

29
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:35.240
used to using the screen
reader at a really fast level.

30
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.153
So the simplest form,
there's something that you hit a web page,

31
00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:41.260
they'll read all the content to you.

32
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.996
They also provide some other cool things
that like some other cool features,

33
00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:48.860
which is you can listen to the website
instead of all the text being read.

34
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.119
You can have it read a list of all
the links that are on the page or

35
00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.465
all the headings and
then you can drill into a certain heading.

36
00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:58.110
So they make it browsing
the web a lot easier for big,

37
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.070
long pages like a Wikipedia entry or
something like that.

38
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.539
You could just check all the links,
check all the headings,

39
00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.370
find the one that you want dive into it.

40
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.290
We're really getting on par with
a mouse user at that point.

41
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.652
The one of the bummers for developers is
there are quite a few screen readers as

42
00:02:14.652 --> 00:02:17.240
we can kinda see a breakdown here.

43
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.410
Different ones work on
different operating systems.

44
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.935
I will say for sure that I would say
like 90 to 95% of the experience

45
00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:28.400
is gonna be the same across
all of the screen readers.

46
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.214
So as long as you make
your site accessible for

47
00:02:31.214 --> 00:02:36.194
one, whichever one you're testing on,
It'll work very well for all of them.

48
00:02:36.194 --> 00:02:41.102
As you get into more popular apps, for
example, when I was doing accessibility

49
00:02:41.102 --> 00:02:44.836
on twitter.com,
which has hundreds of millions of users,

50
00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:48.940
we would occasionally run into
screen readers specific issues and

51
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.070
even version specific so I'm on
version 13 of jaws and this is broken.

52
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.931
One thing to keep in mind here again,
just kind of empathizing with folks,

53
00:02:57.931 --> 00:03:01.916
if you are blind and you use your screen
reader for everything on your laptop,

54
00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:06.910
right for all of your applications, folks
don't update screen readers so often.

55
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.380
One, they're kind of expensive.

56
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.300
A lot of the good ones are and
two, the stakes are really high.

57
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.724
If it messes things up, it can be very
difficult to onboard again and so

58
00:03:15.724 --> 00:03:18.914
you will often find If you work on
a very big app with a lot of users,

59
00:03:18.914 --> 00:03:22.686
you will often find that folks are often
on very old versions of screen readers

60
00:03:22.686 --> 00:03:26.390
because it's working well for
them and they don't wanna change it.

61
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.152
I don't wanna scare anyone away
from accessibility development.

62
00:03:29.152 --> 00:03:32.490
About 90 95% of it will just
get it working nice and easy.

63
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.330
It'll work for everybody.

64
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.210
If you do work on one of
those big massive apps,

65
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.588
you probably will eventually run into some
issue that's like a specific version of

66
00:03:39.588 --> 00:03:41.920
a specific screenwriter because
there are a lot of them.

67
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.394
And again, it's worth noting,
while there is a Wuchang spec and

68
00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:51.410
an HTML spec, there isn't a screen
reader spec in that sense.

69
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.870
So it's sort of up to the individual
companies, how they process that data,

70
00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:55.680
how they read it.

71
00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.245
So like an example bug that I've had years
ago was when we made nested replies on

72
00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:04.603
Twitter.com, right, so you'd have
like the tweet and then it would have

73
00:04:04.603 --> 00:04:09.170
little replies Certain older screen
readers, it would read the entire parent

74
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.942
tweet aloud before each reply, so if you
said like hello and somebody said, hey,

75
00:04:13.942 --> 00:04:18.760
somebody else said hey there it would be
like hello, hey, hello hey there hello.

76
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.230
It just keep reading that first one.

77
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.911
So sometimes you'll run into really like
kind of nitty gritty issues, but for

78
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:28.620
the most part building these apps, once we
get it working, it'll work for everybody.

79
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.471
Jaws and NVDA are those browsers specific
like specific Chrome or Firefox or

80
00:04:33.471 --> 00:04:37.032
are they system specific like Windows Mac,
lit Linux,

81
00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:41.065
there are systems specific so
they run on Windows NVDA is free.

82
00:04:41.065 --> 00:04:42.735
I think jaws is quite expensive.

83
00:04:42.735 --> 00:04:47.375
So yeah, all of these, for
the most part are gonna be system specific

84
00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:52.655
voiceover runs on Mac with the exception
that Chrome box is a browser one.

85
00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:56.620
So I think that might be the only one
that's browser, the restaurant system.

86
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.278
So moving into some specific screen
readers, just some recommendations for

87
00:05:00.278 --> 00:05:03.390
us to kind of get started today for
anyone that wants to.

88
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.080
Mac comes with a built in screen reader.

89
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.328
So if you want to enable it so
you can go to your system preferences,

90
00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:16.510
click accessibility, click voiceover and
then enable it here.

91
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.849
So I'm gonna go ahead and click use and
then it'll start working my sound is off

92
00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.382
but this this little gray area here
is what will be read aloud, and

93
00:05:25.382 --> 00:05:28.180
then you can click the X
at any time to turn it off.

94
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.880
So I'm gonna go ahead and
turn it off for now.

95
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.460
If you are not on Mac, you've got
a couple options you've got NVDA,

96
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.750
which is available for
Windows is totally free and can be here.

97
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.033
Otherwise, you can check out this
Chrome extension which I have here,

98
00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:44.170
which is chrome boxes, screen reader.

99
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.890
It got lower ratings,
maybe it's not as good as the system ones.

100
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.906
But if you're like on Linux, or
if you just don't want to go ahead and

101
00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:55.030
install something on Windows like
this is super good enough for today.

102
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.510
So you can just add it to Chrome, turn
it on, it'll do the same kind of thing.

103
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.724
So for our exercise, which will be coming
up in a minute, we'll take some time for

104
00:06:03.724 --> 00:06:06.123
anyone that's interested to get
set up on a screen reader and

105
00:06:06.123 --> 00:06:08.550
I'll answer any questions
if you run into them.

106
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.850
But before we get into that exercise,
I just kind of want to cover a few screen

107
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.290
readers, specific things for
us to be thinking about.
