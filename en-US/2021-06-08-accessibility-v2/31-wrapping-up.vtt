WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:03.238
If it was coming from the inside,
I would probably push for

2
00:00:03.238 --> 00:00:06.451
a linter as quick as possible,
just so we can get in there and

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:09.175
get some data obviously
coming from the outside.

4
00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:12.268
I don't have access to the code,
so instead of access to the code,

5
00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:13.769
I'll just start with an audit.

6
00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.731
So we'll just go ahead and we'll just do a
lighthouse audit just to get started with

7
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:19.384
it and see kind of what blows back.

8
00:00:21.873 --> 00:00:25.477
So again, just going to lighthouse,
selecting only accessibility for now and

9
00:00:25.477 --> 00:00:26.620
then running the audit.

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.700
Cool, so
the score looks pretty good 81 again,

11
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.879
lighthouse doesn't catch everything but
I think it's a really good starting place.

12
00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.484
So we can kind of see a lot of
stuff that we covered today,

13
00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:41.880
which I always think is cool.

14
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.290
So one thing is buttons that don't
have accessible names to them.

15
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.685
So if we go ahead and we kinda
click on this button And expand it.

16
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.101
Okay, so I've seen this a lot.

17
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:56.650
So, this is like, I actually should
probably add this to one of my talks.

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.980
So this is a super common pattern.

19
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.220
And let me go ahead and right click
here and scroll into view on this thing.

20
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.415
So you have a button,
which is the right element, and

21
00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:08.940
instead of text in there you have an icon.

22
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.303
And that works very, very well,
right in these situations for

23
00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:14.090
visual users that use the mouse.

24
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.430
So the only content inside
this button is this icon.

25
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.135
This is like very, very, very common.

26
00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:24.803
And so what it's complaining about though
is that since it has no content to

27
00:01:24.803 --> 00:01:27.366
be read by screen readers
when they hit this button,

28
00:01:27.366 --> 00:01:30.102
they'll have no idea what
the button is supposed to do,

29
00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:33.540
that it's supposed to tackle to
the left or right of something.

30
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.729
So you can kinda solve that with labeling
it or you could put visually hidden span

31
00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.092
in there with some previous item, next
item description, something like that.

32
00:01:44.092 --> 00:01:48.037
Yeah, that's actually a really great
example because that happens that's just

33
00:01:48.037 --> 00:01:51.710
like such a common web pattern is a button
with an eye tag in it and that's it.

34
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.024
Links do not have a discernible name,
I think this will be the same thing, so

35
00:01:57.024 --> 00:01:59.625
these are,
we can kinda see these nice screenshots.

36
00:01:59.625 --> 00:02:03.632
Let me click on this one here,
yeah, it's just the same thing,

37
00:02:03.632 --> 00:02:06.543
this is kind of really
wish I had covered this.

38
00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.510
Anchors and buttons that don't
have any text content in them.

39
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:10.979
It's just so popular right,

40
00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.583
like a link with a picture link with
a GIF file link with button with a GIF.

41
00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:16.080
These are all kind of the same thing.

42
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.313
So again for these your two options,
are you adding Aria label to it or

43
00:02:21.313 --> 00:02:26.832
adding a visually hidden little span
with a description of what they do.

44
00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:32.586
So we've got this one here, which shows
the scrolling view, cool this one's an ad.

45
00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:33.993
This is another good example.

46
00:02:33.993 --> 00:02:37.200
I think this is an ad, no, it's not.

47
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.290
Okay, it's your own get okay, cool.

48
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.301
Ads are really interesting though,
because that's another thing

49
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:45.060
that you'll find is that your
site will be super accessible.

50
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.781
And then you'll have to integrate with
some third party app and then you'll start

51
00:02:47.781 --> 00:02:50.320
getting errors in your lighthouse builds,
like that happens all the time.

52
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.835
And then it's like, now starting
a conversation with another company about

53
00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:57.146
their accessibility offering and
how you can maybe help them with that.

54
00:02:57.146 --> 00:02:59.951
But yeah, these are the same as
the other ones which is just,

55
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:03.070
give kind of label to it so
screen readers can know.

56
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.670
Looks like there's one contrast issue,
or maybe a couple.

57
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.725
See this one is so interesting, so
it's complaining about this button here,

58
00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:15.548
which to me with the font size like the
white on the red is very easy to discern

59
00:03:15.548 --> 00:03:20.929
the two of them, but it's saying that
they, let's see what score that they have.

60
00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:23.809
I don't know that it actually
gave a specific score, but

61
00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.449
I mean we could grab them and
do a color contrast, but

62
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:30.060
it is complaining about some of
these contrasts on these buttons.

63
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.202
They're so interesting though
cuz some of them just look

64
00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.310
It really just doesn't like the red,
it's like it seems to be red.

65
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.397
It seems to be an issue but so again,

66
00:03:42.397 --> 00:03:47.419
like we could maybe just play around with
the color I wonder if it's in, okay, cool.

67
00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:52.057
So this is interesting though
this says oops, okay, so

68
00:03:52.057 --> 00:03:56.980
here we can see that, so
lighthouse gave it an issue.

69
00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.930
However, we can see that it
actually is double A compliant.

70
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.752
Its contrast ratio is 3.4.

71
00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:05.751
So I think that if you're okay with that,
that's great.

72
00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:07.550
It's not triple A compliant.

73
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.519
Alternatively, you could even just sort
of like if you want to stay in the same

74
00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.695
family, you could just kinda drag
it down to like right here or

75
00:04:14.695 --> 00:04:16.246
somewhere in there, right.

76
00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:19.060
So it's a little darker now but
now it's triple A compliant.

77
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.893
You can mess with that if you wanted to,
but

78
00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:25.209
I think being doubly compliant is fine for
those.

79
00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:29.252
Cool, so kind of going through those, this
is where we go, we covered this one so

80
00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:32.640
it says headings are not in
a sequentially descending order.

81
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.305
So I think here we have some h4s
that are probably not inside h3.

82
00:04:37.305 --> 00:04:42.599
So again, if you need these to be smaller,
for some reason like these should be h3

83
00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:48.229
basically because they're inside or they
even maybe should be h2, so I'm not sure.

84
00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:48.871
But again,

85
00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:53.183
you only wanna use the next h when you're
inside of a current h section, right?

86
00:04:53.183 --> 00:04:54.800
So you start off with the h1.

87
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.694
So the rest of your page to be all h2s,

88
00:04:56.694 --> 00:05:00.500
when you do an h2 then if you have
something before the next h2, it goes 3.

89
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.139
And you can again feel super free to style
at however big you want with CSS like

90
00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.376
there's nothing wrong with making this
an h2 and keeping it 13 pixel font-size.

91
00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.287
But the header tag will make
it confusing when people

92
00:05:13.287 --> 00:05:16.207
use like the router to display
the list of all links.

93
00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:24.550
All right, list items are not
contained within ul or li.

94
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.017
So we looked at this a little
bit earlier that it was kind of

95
00:05:29.017 --> 00:05:33.871
interesting that markup parsing
was part of accessibility.

96
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:37.940
But here's a really good example of
why because lists have some meaning,

97
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.115
that they should be contained inside.

98
00:05:40.115 --> 00:05:42.270
That list items should be
contained inside a list.

99
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.120
And maybe screen readers or assistive
tech is not exactly sure what to do.

100
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.331
So this div class items here should
be either a ul for unordered or

101
00:05:51.331 --> 00:05:57.038
ol if you want it to be ordered,
we can go ahead and scroll it into view.

102
00:05:57.038 --> 00:05:58.350
Again, these are interesting.

103
00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.370
I see these a lot where it's like where
you've done your own design, right?

104
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.289
Like this is totally
your own custom design.

105
00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.923
So either make this a ul, which is totally
adequate, or these just don't need to be

106
00:06:10.923 --> 00:06:14.984
ul, they could be spans and then you
could design them that way too back.

107
00:06:14.984 --> 00:06:19.620
Yep awesome that's it.

108
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.520
Cool, yeah I mean it scores really well.

109
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.349
I'm so glad you pointed out these
examples of the buttons and

110
00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.133
the links cuz that's just so common.

111
00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:28.070
I see that a lot doing audits.

112
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.485
The rest of it,
yeah some color stuff, although,

113
00:06:30.485 --> 00:06:33.250
it seemed like a lot of the colors
were double A compliant.

114
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.155
Some headings which I think you can
keep the exact same styles just change

115
00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:38.830
the actual tag to an h2 or h3.

116
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.759
And then these just either
make the parent a list or

117
00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.793
make the children not list items.

118
00:06:43.793 --> 00:06:45.160
I like doing these, they're fun,

119
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.355
because I don't have to do all
the hard work of fixing it.

120
00:06:47.355 --> 00:06:49.672
I can just say, hey,
this is what's wrong, see here.

121
00:06:49.672 --> 00:06:53.971
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just had a question about

122
00:06:53.971 --> 00:06:57.915
internationalization, if you
can point to any resources?

123
00:06:57.915 --> 00:06:59.424
Just very quickly.

124
00:06:59.424 --> 00:07:01.875
&gt;&gt; Yeah it kind of depends a little bit.

125
00:07:01.875 --> 00:07:04.380
Usually they're a little
bit bound to the framework.

126
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:09.970
So like at my job, we use react and
so we use a react in all by Yahoo,

127
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.340
I think or somebody I can't remember.

128
00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.930
So usually finding the
internationalization if you're using a UI

129
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.639
framework.

130
00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:23.090
If you're not using a UI framework I wish
I had a better suggestion because they all

131
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.067
work in like the same way where you enter
the key to an object and then you have

132
00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:33.690
a million different files, one for each
language or that key maps to a string.

133
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.696
And then based on you know, they swap out
which file is being loaded, but I know for

134
00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:40.794
sure if you do, can you tell me
a little bit about the codebase?

135
00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:46.189
Is it using like, front end framework or
is it just raw HTML?

136
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:49.326
&gt;&gt; I was using it for
a small like Jekyll project.

137
00:07:49.326 --> 00:07:51.910
Gotcha, I want Jekyll might have one.

138
00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:56.951
So another way for static sites,
sometimes the way that they work is

139
00:07:56.951 --> 00:08:01.906
they'll generate pages like so
it'll be like your site comm slash

140
00:08:01.906 --> 00:08:07.450
language slash the link or
whatever yeah, so this is interesting.

141
00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:09.882
I wonder how,
this looks like they're doing a manual.

142
00:08:09.882 --> 00:08:13.007
So there's a lot to think about the
questions really good because there's so

143
00:08:13.007 --> 00:08:13.880
much to think about.

144
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.490
So like, one thing to think about is,
how are you going to get the translation.

145
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.043
So there's like free
apps that you could use,

146
00:08:20.043 --> 00:08:24.822
there's paid services that you could use,
and then there's like actually requiring

147
00:08:24.822 --> 00:08:27.579
that one to one touch of
a user creating your blog.

148
00:08:27.579 --> 00:08:32.339
So for example like, I think Dan Abrams,

149
00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:37.650
who works on react,
his blog is very popular.

150
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:41.028
So what happens is that,
he'll write like an article, and

151
00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:45.164
then readers will actually translate
it for him, which is really cool.

152
00:08:45.164 --> 00:08:48.846
And so what he does is if you
submit a manual translation to him,

153
00:08:48.846 --> 00:08:51.810
he'll build a new page
like in his Jekyll app.

154
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.317
That would be slash the language and
then slash the thing, right?

155
00:08:55.317 --> 00:08:56.972
And then this will be the translated one.

156
00:08:56.972 --> 00:08:59.790
So it depends a little bit on like how
you're getting the translations, right.

157
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.715
If you're getting the manually sent in,

158
00:09:01.715 --> 00:09:05.464
then it's probably fine to just manually
make a new folder and paste it in there.

159
00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:09.446
If you're using a service then you
definitely have to find something to help

160
00:09:09.446 --> 00:09:10.949
automate that a little bit.

161
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:12.443
I'm not sure about Jekyll,

162
00:09:12.443 --> 00:09:16.500
I really appreciate everybody coming
hanging out all your great question.

163
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.900
I truly feel like your questions made the
workshop a lot better than it would have

164
00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.570
been without.

165
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.474
So thank you very much for that and
fun being somewhat social,

166
00:09:24.474 --> 00:09:27.040
this counts as social for me these days.

167
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.032
This is like the most,

168
00:09:28.032 --> 00:09:31.071
most people I've seen,
even though it's digital in quite a while.

169
00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.560
So, thanks so much for spending the day.

170
00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.746
And like I said, I'm always online like
if you find me on Twitter or whatever and

171
00:09:37.746 --> 00:09:41.496
want to talk about something or open
a GitHub issue on the repo like I love

172
00:09:41.496 --> 00:09:45.580
engaging so if you have more questions or
find an error or anything like that.

173
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.289
I'd always be happy to talk
about accessibility stuff.
