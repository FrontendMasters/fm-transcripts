1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.380
All right, let's work through
the fourth exercise together.

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.010
So again, there's a lot of different ways
to do this, but I always wanna just focus

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.360
on the accessibility part so not to worry
too much about any JavaScript or CSS.

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.821
But so if we go over into our code editor,

5
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:23.820
I'm gonna close these tabs and
open 4.html.

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.564
So the idea is we've got
this navigation list here.

7
00:00:27.564 --> 00:00:32.759
So we know for sure, let's say at
the beginning here somewhere we want

8
00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.410
something like a link, and
we want it to say skip to main content.

9
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.800
I think if I save that and then I come
back over to this page, okay, cool.

10
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.945
So we've got this link.

11
00:00:44.888 --> 00:00:49.190
Sorry, I didn't realize I was
still in this answers branch.

12
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.224
Let me check out.

13
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:58.046
Cool, so we'll go ahead and just like we
did before, but on a different branch,

14
00:00:58.046 --> 00:01:01.053
so I will do a,
we're not sure where it goes yet.

15
00:01:01.053 --> 00:01:04.661
We wanna do skip to main content.

16
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:05.933
Cool, so we save that, great.

17
00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:09.499
So we've got this thing, and I mean,
that's good for screen reader users now,

18
00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:11.978
we're they'll hit Tab and
they'll have this option.

19
00:01:11.978 --> 00:01:14.910
But it's not great visually for
the rest of these links.

20
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.805
So basically, what we'll want to do
here is we'll wanna find a way to hide,

21
00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:22.490
so I'm just gonna do an inline style tag.

22
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.162
So we'll wanna take this anchor and
we'll give it an id of a skiplink or

23
00:01:28.162 --> 00:01:30.360
something like that.

24
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.705
And then, in CSS, so
we'll take skiplink, and

25
00:01:33.705 --> 00:01:38.369
then there's a lot of different
ways to move things off the screen.

26
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.410
But I think we can just position absolute
it, and then transform it off the screen.

27
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:50.600
So we can do any of these translates,
something like this.

28
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.510
And so now, if we refresh,
it should be gone, right?

29
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.680
So it's somewhere, where did I put it?

30
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.359
-100% y, somewhere off the screen,
and so that's great, too.

31
00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.195
So we can even see,
it's kind of interesting.

32
00:02:01.195 --> 00:02:05.523
I know it's very subtle, but if you're
following along, when we hit Tab for

33
00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:09.070
the first time, now we can see
a little focus ring up here.

34
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.800
So, it's like the browser's indicating
something's focused that's not

35
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.430
in view, right?

36
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.070
Cuz it's our link that's
just not in view right now.

37
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.931
And so the second to last piece of the
puzzle is that we'll also then need to do,

38
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.440
okay well,
when skiplink gets focused, right?

39
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.626
This is, again, like CSS and
HTML communicating with each other, so

40
00:02:26.626 --> 00:02:30.010
when you call .focus or
when you tab to something it gets focused.

41
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.272
And so then, we can do another
transform back, basically.

42
00:02:33.272 --> 00:02:36.470
So whatever we did, and
we'll just set it to 0%.

43
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.171
And so now, if we go back to
the website and we refresh again,

44
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:45.049
this still needs some cosmetic tweaks,
but when you hit it this thing appears.

45
00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.772
And so I think we'd give
it a background color and

46
00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:51.070
some stuff like that to make
sure that it really pops.

47
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.911
I think the New York Times does it cool
where they already have whitespace in

48
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:55.907
a certain area and
they fill that in with a skiplink.

49
00:02:55.907 --> 00:02:59.358
But I think it's always
fine to just give this,

50
00:02:59.358 --> 00:03:04.204
let's see if we just do background
orange or something like that.

51
00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:05.347
There we go, and then this thing.

52
00:03:05.347 --> 00:03:07.853
Again, we could add some padding,
we could make it nice looking, but

53
00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:08.753
the idea is still there.

54
00:03:08.753 --> 00:03:11.330
And if you hit Tab again,
it takes you to the Home thing.

55
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.063
So the very last thing we need
to do is we need to activate it.

56
00:03:14.063 --> 00:03:16.375
So what happens when
you click the skiplink?

57
00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:21.770
And again, that trick that I had mentioned
earlier where you can add ids to anything.

58
00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.907
So you could add an id of
foo to this button, and

59
00:03:24.907 --> 00:03:29.270
then in the a anchor up here,
we could send the href to foo.

60
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.720
And so now, if we refresh again,
we get the thing, we hit Enter on it, and

61
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.290
we can see that it focuses us down there.

62
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.569
So the parts again were
making an anchor at the top,

63
00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.470
which is great except it
ruins the visual aesthetic.

64
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.794
Hide the anchor, have a focus
selector that undoes whatever you did

65
00:03:43.794 --> 00:03:47.950
to hide the anchor, absolute position,
moving it off the screen, whatever.

66
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.662
And the last thing is give an id to where
you want people to be able to focus, and

67
00:03:52.662 --> 00:03:54.780
then in the anchor href to that id.

68
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:56.790
Any questions on that?

69
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.650
How are people feeling
about that in general?

70
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.370
Happy to talk it out or
go over the code again, whatever.

71
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.320
So yeah, if this is for visually impaired
users, why even have the orange button?

72
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.140
So for example, we could even
not have a focus state, right?

73
00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.290
We could just have a thing that's
hidden and it'll still show up.

74
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.450
That's a really good call.

75
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.889
I think my thing that I would say is
that it is always incredibly difficult

76
00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.610
to try to predict users because they're so
diverse and they're so varied.

77
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.770
And so, for an example,
there was this movement years ago where

78
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.646
websites would have their very feature
rich, robust, beautiful version.

79
00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:40.893
And then, you would click a button that
said I need the accessibility version, and

80
00:04:40.893 --> 00:04:44.470
it would be this nothing fun,
no colors, not at all pretty, black and

81
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.870
white content.

82
00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.202
And folks were really upset where they're
like I'm an artist, I love beautiful

83
00:04:49.202 --> 00:04:52.640
colors and beautiful design,
I just need these little bits of help.

84
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.865
So I think about it like that,
that's one answer,

85
00:04:55.865 --> 00:05:00.590
is whenever I'm building these things,
I try to just not, I don't know,

86
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.882
I guess not assume that it's going
to be fully non-sighted users.

87
00:05:04.882 --> 00:05:09.594
And another example would be that what
about just power users who just like

88
00:05:09.594 --> 00:05:11.429
using the keyboard around.

89
00:05:11.429 --> 00:05:15.024
Just the idea of people that do need to
see it cuz they don't have a screen reader

90
00:05:15.024 --> 00:05:15.580
turned on.

91
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.840
And so,
I think those would be my two answers.

92
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.164
You're not sure, some people are keyboard
only and don't use screen readers, so

93
00:05:21.164 --> 00:05:22.260
they need a way.

94
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.956
But then also that it's very difficult
to predict what's gonna happen.

95
00:05:28.956 --> 00:05:32.643
And I gave a conference talk
once on accessibility, and

96
00:05:32.643 --> 00:05:37.123
there was this guy Jennison,
he leads accessibility at LinkedIn.

97
00:05:37.123 --> 00:05:39.752
And he has all these great stories
about these kind of accessibility

98
00:05:39.752 --> 00:05:43.360
misses where people thought they were
kind of doing a good thing or whatever.

99
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.601
And he talks about working for this car
company, he wasn't working for it but

100
00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:51.140
somebody was working for
this car company that did car rentals.

101
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.194
And they had decided
kind of in their head,

102
00:05:53.194 --> 00:05:56.506
not trying to be mean, that well,
since blind people don't drive,

103
00:05:56.506 --> 00:05:59.841
then there would be no need to make
the car rental portal accessible.

104
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.580
Because they could just say, hey,
this is just for renting cars.

105
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.874
And they started getting all these
complaints from blind parents who

106
00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:09.616
are like, hey, I'm on your site, I'm
trying to rent a car for my daughter for

107
00:06:09.616 --> 00:06:11.511
the weekend and you just won't let me.

108
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:16.346
And so I always remember that story cuz it
really hit me as okay, just trying to make

109
00:06:16.346 --> 00:06:20.400
it as flexible as possible,
basically, cuz you just never know.

110
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.887
But it is a really good question,
for sure.

111
00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:24.895
If you're doing something for
screen reader only,

112
00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:26.226
you don't need to make it visual.

113
00:06:26.226 --> 00:06:29.500
But I would say for skiplinks,
since they're used by so many people,

114
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.897
to make it visual in some way.

115
00:06:30.897 --> 00:06:34.121
And even to go as far as to make
it fit in with your design brand,

116
00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:37.230
the right font and
the right placement, things like that.
