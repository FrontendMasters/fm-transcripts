00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.204
Let's work through this together.

2
00:00:03.204 --> 00:00:06.202
I think I'm just gonna do it in two parts.

3
00:00:06.202 --> 00:00:10.340
So I think the first thing is reading
the dark and light mode preferences.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.910
And then we'll talk about
the checkbox toggle separately.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.920
So I'll go into my code,
close these and open Exercise 5.

6
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.291
So we've got this stuff, so again,
I'm just gonna use an inline style tag.

7
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:32.325
So we've got this container
actually we kind of need, okay, so

8
00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:35.401
we've got body already has
a class on it of main.

9
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:39.107
So let's go back to the code example.

10
00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:43.390
And get these media queries that we need.

11
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.534
Here we go, so

12
00:00:46.534 --> 00:00:52.140
we can just kinda grab these to see
which color scheme the user prefers.

13
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.216
So if they prefer the dark scheme
then we'll set it to black, and

14
00:00:56.216 --> 00:01:00.841
if they prefer the light scheme then
we'll set the background to white.

15
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:05.070
The only differences in my example I used
wrapper whereas in this we used main.

16
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.994
And I think the other thing that
we'll just wanna do is set the color.

17
00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:12.273
So quite simply, if it's a dark
background we'll use a light color and

18
00:01:12.273 --> 00:01:16.850
if it's a light background for now we
use a dark color, so let's head over.

19
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.990
Okay, so I refresh and it's black.

20
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.340
And then if I go into my settings and
set them to white, okay, cool.

21
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.143
So this is working, so
if I change my operating system settings,

22
00:01:29.143 --> 00:01:31.472
the page itself changes.

23
00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:32.934
Yeah, so that's pretty good.

24
00:01:32.934 --> 00:01:37.033
And then there's a few different ways,
again, not wanting to get too into

25
00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:41.720
the JavaScript of it all, but we could
do this toggle in a few different ways.

26
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.263
So we wanna do something
like an unclick here, right?

27
00:01:46.263 --> 00:01:48.040
And we'll just call a toggle function.

28
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.520
And then we can do an inline script tag
here as well as we do function toggle.

29
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.432
And so, kind of think I had a way
earlier that I thought of for this,

30
00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:00.961
but maybe it's not the cleanest.

31
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:04.930
I sort of think maybe we can move a lot
more stuff to JavaScript if we wanted.

32
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.640
But I think for now I made,
what was I thinking?

33
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.300
I thought of you could have
an override light class.

34
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.166
Something like that that would force
the background to be white and

35
00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.628
the color, to be black.

36
00:02:19.628 --> 00:02:24.868
So regardless of what div you're in,
and then you could have

37
00:02:24.868 --> 00:02:29.920
an override dark as well,
background black color white.

38
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.339
In a front end framework, if I was using,

39
00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.184
I'd do something kind of
similar in a react app.

40
00:02:35.184 --> 00:02:41.140
But instead of doing this stuff with CSS
or whatever, I use the use state hook.

41
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.320
So as it updates it re renders that
section, so that works really well.

42
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.850
But in HTML,
I'm just gonna add some classes for now.

43
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.050
Okay, so toggle gets clicked,
I'll do just a quick console log.

44
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.434
Make sure I'm in here.

45
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.080
Console toggle, okay, that's working.

46
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.710
And then we can just do,
I had sent that, yeah this code here.

47
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.435
So we'll want to do something like this,
I think, for the toggle.

48
00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:17.647
So we'll be like, okay, if window
match media prefers color scheme,

49
00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:22.630
and then we'll want to do I
think like that equals light.

50
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.950
I think that the API for the first
color scheme is always with colons.

51
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.560
I think it's not a triple equal,
I think I got that wrong.

52
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.289
I think it's like window match media,

53
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:39.610
prefers-color-scheme dark,
something like that.

54
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.460
Yeah, okay, sorry, I got the syntax wrong.

55
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.411
So it's like if window.match media,
and then you're looking for

56
00:03:46.411 --> 00:03:49.490
a specific value, so
prefers-color-scheme is set to dark.

57
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.780
So then else here would
be light mode is set.

58
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.448
So I think you would want to do,
let's see.

59
00:04:01.448 --> 00:04:04.423
I'm trying not to get too like into
the code, but I was thinking about so

60
00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:07.900
we would want the prefers to figure out
what the default is gonna be, right?

61
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.866
So we can do something
like default theme equals.

62
00:04:12.866 --> 00:04:16.309
So if their default theme is dark,

63
00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:20.703
then we could do default
theme equals dark,

64
00:04:20.703 --> 00:04:25.280
else we could do default
theme equals light.

65
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.388
So this way we would know in JavaScript
what it would be default set to.

66
00:04:32.388 --> 00:04:37.580
And so then we could do,
grab that main class.

67
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.630
So main equals document,
query selector main.

68
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.600
So this is just grabbing that body
with the class of main there.

69
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.610
Okay, so we got the thing, I'm actually
gonna change this to current theme.

70
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.506
We initially set the current
theme to dark if it's in dark, or

71
00:04:57.506 --> 00:04:59.494
light if it's in light,

72
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:07.995
That's fine and
then after that then we'll do,

73
00:05:14.152 --> 00:05:16.876
Okay, I think we wanna do.

74
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.787
Just thinking this out.

75
00:05:24.787 --> 00:05:27.106
So we don't want to do it
in the toggle necessarily,

76
00:05:27.106 --> 00:05:28.750
grabbing those each time, so okay.

77
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.615
I wonder if we do currently light theme,
and

78
00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:37.221
that is set to this window
match media equals light.

79
00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:42.533
Okay, so do it kind of this way.

80
00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:47.277
So outside of the toggle class just in
JavaScript, we'll grab the main thing and

81
00:05:47.277 --> 00:05:50.820
then we'll set this to be
whether it's light or not.

82
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.308
And then inside the toggle,
we will just do, okay, if it's currently

83
00:05:56.308 --> 00:06:02.166
the light theme, then we'll set it to
currently light theme equals false.

84
00:06:02.166 --> 00:06:07.886
And if it's not, then we'll set currently,
like theme equals true.

85
00:06:07.886 --> 00:06:11.540
And I think the last thing that we'll need
to do is just grab the main that we have.

86
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.420
And we'll just set the class
to that override that we made.

87
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.780
There's probably some
different ways to do this.

88
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.262
I was just trying to think of something
that wasn't too JavaScript intensive.

89
00:06:24.262 --> 00:06:25.881
All right, let's give this a whirl.

90
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:27.375
So we load in and then okay.

91
00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:29.510
So yeah, so this is a little bit tricky.

92
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.018
So basically I was thinking the script
loads, we'll grab the body, that's great.

93
00:06:33.018 --> 00:06:36.220
We'll figure out if the default was
a light theme or a dark theme, right?

94
00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.940
Because we know that that default is
being set by this prefers color scheme.

95
00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:43.510
So we store that either light or
dark, so either true or false.

96
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.050
And then every time the toggle gets
clicked, we see is it true or is it false?

97
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.720
And if it's true, then we set it to light.

98
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.750
And if it's false, then we set it to
dark and then we flip it each time.

99
00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.880
So every time you click toggle,
it should just change from black to white.

100
00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.424
So yeah, those get a little tricky like I
said, and then unlike my personal site,

101
00:07:06.424 --> 00:07:08.890
I have a whole nother layer
of a local storage thing.

102
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.572
Cuz right now, if you set it to white and
then you refresh it,

103
00:07:11.572 --> 00:07:14.210
it'll go back to black because
it goes back to the default.

104
00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.200
So you even probably wanna
add another layer to it.

105
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.240
So this one gets a little confusing, but

106
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.420
as far as reading the prefers
color scheme part is very easy.

107
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.180
Other than that,
you do get into some local state and

108
00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.074
some JavaScript functionality and
things like that.

109
00:07:27.074 --> 00:07:28.952
But yeah, it is really cool though.

110
00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:30.389
I really like being able to set it.

111
00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:33.367
And I think it looks really slick when
you visit a site and it just instantly

112
00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:36.170
knows that you prefer dark mode or
light mode, something like that.

113
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.750
And also, for what it's worth, I'll push
all of these solutions up to GitHub repo.

114
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:45.518
So if anybody wants to see the code or
anything like that later,

115
00:07:45.518 --> 00:07:46.470
it'll all be there.
