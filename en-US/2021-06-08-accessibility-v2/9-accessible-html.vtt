00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.114
A lot of this stuff is just about using
the tools that HTML already gives us.

2
00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:10.054
So I think one thing that's kind
of cool about accessibility

3
00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:13.143
is that you can do a lot
just by using the proper or

4
00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:17.801
like semantic elements in HTML for
what you're trying to accomplish.

5
00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:22.885
So, one pattern that we see a lot
is that folks will just use,

6
00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.397
kind of divs for everything.

7
00:00:25.397 --> 00:00:28.482
I saw somebody on Twitter once,
call it div soup.

8
00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:31.118
And I kind of like that where it's
just like I don't know div is

9
00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:32.090
a perfectly good tag.

10
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.802
It's a block level element.

11
00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:38.940
It doesn't have any styles attached to
it and so they just use making a header

12
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.172
use a div making a button, use a div,
making anything, just use a div for it.

13
00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:48.499
But what's interesting about these HTML
elements is that while some of them

14
00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:53.700
provide purely semantic value, some of
them have a lot of functionality built in.

15
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.360
That maybe we don't know about, or
we just don't think about all that often.

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.166
So, for example, some that don't have
functionality, but they do have semantic,

17
00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.030
meaning our aside, footer and header.

18
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.356
And so those might help like your SEO
score, your website health score, but

19
00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:11.490
they don't really do anything.

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.456
They're not gonna add extra utility for
screen readers,

21
00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:16.705
they're not gonna add anything like that.

22
00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:22.185
But other ones such as button input and
text area provide a lot of functionality.

23
00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:24.708
So I think that like for
an example a text area,

24
00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:27.570
people just use text area
when they need it, right.

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.031
Like if you need a big form field,
you're just gonna use that.

26
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:33.976
But buttons are really tricky because they
come with a lot of styling that folks

27
00:01:33.976 --> 00:01:38.278
don't really like the look of and so often
I'll even see this in like design systems,

28
00:01:38.278 --> 00:01:41.203
people will just use a span or
a div with a class of button and

29
00:01:41.203 --> 00:01:43.610
then they'll style at themselves.

30
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.140
And I think one thing that's tricky is
understanding like how much goes into

31
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.255
these elements that maybe
we're not thinking of and

32
00:01:51.255 --> 00:01:54.609
the impact that it can have
on users with disabilities.

33
00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:58.554
So, before we get into examples,
kind of back to our web aim thing,

34
00:01:58.554 --> 00:02:00.330
the theme of the course.

35
00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.009
So for web aim compliance,
the important ones are like h1,

36
00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.592
h2, h3 are used for headings.

37
00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:11.920
And we'll see that later with the screen
readers, I can actually show it right now.

38
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.816
So if I go ahead and
I turn my screen reader on, and again,

39
00:02:16.816 --> 00:02:20.899
this is voiceover, and
then I go ahead and I do.

40
00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:25.400
It's like option control U will bring
up this thing in voiceover, but

41
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.688
I can do things like I can look at
all of the articles across the top.

42
00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:35.980
I can go to links and
it'll read all of the links on the page.

43
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.294
So if I wanted to like scan through
the links and I can go to headings and

44
00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:41.970
I can then arrow key
through all the headings.

45
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.805
So you could immediately see here how,
if for example, your design system used

46
00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:51.874
like divs and then you use class h1,
class h2, and you styled them differently.

47
00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:55.952
Or if you just made everything h1 or
everything h2, something like that,

48
00:02:55.952 --> 00:03:00.159
you can see how this would make it very
difficult on folks using these assistive

49
00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.310
technologies.

50
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.362
So properly nested use h1 at
the top of the screen only have

51
00:03:04.362 --> 00:03:07.602
one of them than anything under
that as a top level sections and

52
00:03:07.602 --> 00:03:09.490
h2, 3s inside things like that.

53
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.997
So again this is like something that's
relatively easy to accomplish just HTML,

54
00:03:13.997 --> 00:03:16.087
just making sure using the right tag,

55
00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:18.789
but can have a really
profound impact on people.

56
00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.928
And so again,
if you have style considerations,

57
00:03:21.928 --> 00:03:25.079
I would encourage you
always use the proper tags.

58
00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.265
So use an h3 and
make it bigger if you need to Again,

59
00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:31.620
anything you do in CSS won't
affect screen readers.

60
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.285
So if you really want a big label, but
it's technically the third nested heading,

61
00:03:36.285 --> 00:03:38.830
use the proper heading
then add a class to it.

62
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.368
Then do whatever you want in CSS
to make it look the way that you'd

63
00:03:41.368 --> 00:03:42.780
like it to look.

64
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.818
But don't just use different elements for
those styles and the same with a button,

65
00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:48.500
which we'll get into in a minute.

66
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.758
If you need a button, use a button don't
use a div and style as much better to

67
00:03:52.758 --> 00:03:56.084
use a button and then add a class and
then style that class.

68
00:03:56.084 --> 00:04:00.459
Yeah, the webAIM's Recommendations,
especially on the h1s, uls, ols,

69
00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.393
blockquotes, things like that.

70
00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:03.712
Those have meaning.

71
00:04:03.712 --> 00:04:05.999
They can be really helpful for

72
00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:09.669
accessibility assistive
device users to use.

73
00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.060
Text labels for form input elements,
we'll get into that in a minute.

74
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.561
But again, making sure that when
you're using a screen reader,

75
00:04:16.561 --> 00:04:20.204
it'll read aloud what the user is
supposed to do in that form field.

76
00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:21.353
And then the reading and

77
00:04:21.353 --> 00:04:24.986
navigation order to determine by
the code order is logical and intuitive.

78
00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:28.767
So again, just thinking about for
an example on this page like this is an h1

79
00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:31.990
because it's kind of like
the top level description.

80
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.742
Any high level elements
under that will be an h2.

81
00:04:34.742 --> 00:04:36.581
Then if I had a couple
sections under that,

82
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:38.840
that would be h3 is just
thinking about it that way.
