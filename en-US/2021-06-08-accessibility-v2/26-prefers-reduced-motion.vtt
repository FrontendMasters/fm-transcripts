00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.732
These are like some of my
absolute favorite API's.

2
00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:03.972
They're so cool.

3
00:00:03.972 --> 00:00:08.651
So at a very high-level rolling in
talk about two of them today, but

4
00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:12.920
there are all these APIs in webinar
that start with prefers and

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.773
what they're doing is they're giving you
access to specific system information.

6
00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:21.234
So operating system level information.

7
00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.834
So you have a disability,
you get a new laptop,

8
00:00:23.834 --> 00:00:25.914
then you set it up for accessibility.

9
00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:30.890
So you say, hey, in this example like
the question, I suffer from seizures.

10
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.759
I wanna make sure that I select
the reduced motion option inside

11
00:00:34.759 --> 00:00:35.856
accessibility.

12
00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:39.820
So that means that like a lot of
the cool Mac effects will just skip and

13
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.823
they'll just go either very slow or
just instant.

14
00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:44.220
So not a lot of flashing.

15
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.696
We've had that for
years in the system level.

16
00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:50.970
What we haven't had as any way to
engage with those API's on the web.

17
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.742
And so now, we have these ways
like this prefers reduced motion.

18
00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:57.270
I'll come back to this WebAIM,
but I just wanna show an example.

19
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.436
So let's say we start with a div and
we give it a class of animation, and

20
00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:02.005
we put the word animated box in it.

21
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:05.273
And then with CSS,
we do something like this.

22
00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:11.975
We say, okay, that class Should have
a pulsing animation every second.

23
00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.995
What you can now do as
a media query is you can say,

24
00:01:14.995 --> 00:01:19.570
if the user prefers reduced motion,
then instead of that fancy pulsating

25
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.680
animation just do a nice
simple dissolve animation.

26
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.070
And what this looks
like is this demo here.

27
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.756
So you see this box is like pulsating.

28
00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:33.663
I go into my preferences accessibility
display and I click reduce motion.

29
00:01:33.663 --> 00:01:35.211
That's where my whole system.

30
00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:38.512
And as soon as I click on reduce motion,
the web instantly updates.

31
00:01:38.512 --> 00:01:41.830
So we'll see I go into system [references,
accessibility,

32
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.401
display as soon as I click it.

33
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:47.410
The thing stops and switches over
to a nice dissolve animation.

34
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.561
So you can really build as many things as
you want with a nice animation as long as

35
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:57.712
you put a media query under it that says,
okay, if they prefer reduce motion do

36
00:01:57.712 --> 00:02:02.810
this instead whether it's nothing or
a lighter animation is totally great.

37
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.263
So this is a very, very cool and it allows
us to do things that normally would be

38
00:02:07.263 --> 00:02:10.910
rightfully criticized as being
even potentially dangerous.

39
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.231
Like the question mentioned,
what if people have seizures that we can

40
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:17.213
now do very comfortably,
because we know that anybody that has

41
00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:20.840
accessibility settings turned on we'll
get this much better experience.

42
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.390
So yeah, back to WebAIM on that one.

43
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.837
They say, no page content flashes more
than three times per second, unless it's

44
00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:33.718
really small and then they have
guidelines on what really small means.

45
00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:35.382
But to be a Triple A compliant,

46
00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:38.620
no page content flashes more
than three times per second.

47
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.473
So the only takeaways here would be three
times per second is a really good rule to

48
00:02:42.473 --> 00:02:44.613
just follow,
just not do it more than that.

49
00:02:44.613 --> 00:02:46.628
Even if you're slower than that and

50
00:02:46.628 --> 00:02:50.725
you have the time offering some kind
of prefers reduced motion even if you

51
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:54.300
just simply have no animation
can be a really nice experience.
