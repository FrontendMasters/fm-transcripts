>> Hey everybody, welcome to my introduction to accessibility workshop. Before we get into it, I just want to do a little housekeeping. This workshop can be found on my GitHub, which is github.com/jkup/learn-a11y So here learn-a11y. And it can also be found online at learn-a11y.netlify.app. And so you can do it either way.

We're gonna have a bunch of exercises later on, so you might wanna go ahead and grab the code. But otherwise, if you just wanna follow along on the amplify app, you can feel free to do that too. For the code itself, there's no server or build tool or anything like that required.

So you go ahead and either get clone it or you can just download it as like a zip and unzip it and it's just HTML file. So it should be pretty easy to get set up and going. A little bit about me. My name is john Cooperman. I've been doing software engineering for the last 12 years or so mostly web development.

[00:00:57]
And during the last, I don't know, five or six years I've started to really specialize in web performance and accessibility. So I love teaching about that stuff. That's what I do a lot during my day job. Yeah, I have a lot of fun just taking the things as I learned them, putting them together and doing these workshops
