1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.990
Okay, so here's the last one.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.442
We're gonna go to
the desktop version of this.

3
00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:13.977
This has an @media(min-width: 800 px).

4
00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:21.123
And if we look at that,
this is the crazy one.

5
00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:23.738
Remember where we have these columns,

6
00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:26.918
where they're not breaking
at the paragraph?

7
00:00:26.918 --> 00:00:31.310
There's something else weird
that's going on here, okay?

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.919
So, that is what you're
going to work on next, and

9
00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:36.782
then I'll go through the answers with you,
all right?

10
00:00:41.137 --> 00:00:44.460
So, we've got actually two little
layouts here that we're doing.

11
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.739
One is sort of an intermediate, where
we're gonna have two columns of text here,

12
00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:48.702
followed by the image.

13
00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:52.139
And then, the last one will be the three
columns of text on the top, and

14
00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:53.374
the image on the bottom.

15
00:00:53.374 --> 00:00:55.420
So let's go through those.

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.533
Here at 800 pixels, well, we got here
a couple of little things to do.

17
00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:07.087
First of all, our fancy text is bigger.

18
00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:14.168
So our font-size: var {--xl},
we want it to be even bigger now

19
00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:22.750
So the next thing I'm going to do is set
my article to still have the two columns,

20
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.405
but I want them to be different sizes.

21
00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:28.182
I want to have my

22
00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:36.525
grid-template-columns to be 2fr, 1fr.

23
00:01:36.525 --> 00:01:42.033
So in other words, I want my text to
take up twice as much room as the image.

24
00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:45.529
Great, and
then on the image wrapper itself,

25
00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:49.303
I'm gonna give it a little
bit of breathing room.

26
00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:58.579
.article-img-wrapper {margin:
.5rem 0 0 2rem}.

27
00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.171
How did we determine that?

28
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:04.329
Lengthy testing, of course, to figure
out exactly how it was going to be.

29
00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.053
We're not done with the text on that side,
it'll make sense momentarily.

30
00:02:09.053 --> 00:02:15.675
All right, so now what I'm going to do is,
what I wound up doing here,

31
00:02:15.675 --> 00:02:21.982
our paragraphs are always displaying
together as a unit, right?

32
00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:24.422
Paragraphs are always
displaying together as a unit.

33
00:02:24.422 --> 00:02:31.396
So what I wound up doing here is
I added a div class "main-text".

34
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:37.014
To put around these paragraphs.

35
00:02:37.014 --> 00:02:38.866
We always want them together.

36
00:02:38.866 --> 00:02:42.351
Now I can treat them as a unit for
layout purposes.

37
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:47.107
Rather than worrying about where exactly
these paragraphs are gonna go and how

38
00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:52.528
they're gonna display, I've grouped them
together and treated them as a unit, okay?

39
00:02:52.528 --> 00:02:55.984
And when you do that, you should go back
and check your other breakpoints and

40
00:02:55.984 --> 00:02:58.362
make sure you didn't break
anything along the way.

41
00:02:58.362 --> 00:03:03.280
We won't have, which is why I could
add this at this late point in time.

42
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.540
Everything else is fine.

43
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.347
Okay, so
then what I'm going to do in order

44
00:03:11.347 --> 00:03:16.020
to make the magic text thing happen here,

45
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.734
is on, Oops, I think I have one too many.

46
00:03:26.006 --> 00:03:28.272
Here we go.

47
00:03:28.272 --> 00:03:29.560
That's there.

48
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.216
Okay, great.

49
00:03:31.216 --> 00:03:35.858
Then, what I'm going to do here is I'm
going to set my class of main-text.

50
00:03:38.074 --> 00:03:43.652
And the trick is columns: 2.

51
00:03:43.652 --> 00:03:47.646
You didn't know this trick, did you?

52
00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:50.474
This is totally a trick.

53
00:03:50.474 --> 00:03:52.716
So that's all it takes.

54
00:03:52.716 --> 00:03:55.017
We put columns 2 on the parent here, and

55
00:03:55.017 --> 00:03:59.759
the children will lay themselves out
here into 2-2 columns, breaking wherever

56
00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:03.639
they need to in order to make two
columns of roughly the same height.

57
00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.976
Although, you'll notice that we have a bit
of a funny gap here at the top of this

58
00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:08.517
column.

59
00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:10.677
Anyone have any idea
where that comes from?

60
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.837
&gt;&gt; Is it a default styling of a div,
or something?

61
00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:19.830
&gt;&gt; Default styling of a div or something?

62
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.959
Could be, but-
&gt;&gt; Is it centered vertically, and

63
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:27.785
there's just a little bit of extra padding
or margin at the top of that element?

64
00:04:27.785 --> 00:04:29.106
&gt;&gt; There could be something like that.

65
00:04:29.106 --> 00:04:30.532
Well, how do we figure this out?

66
00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:36.537
We could say border: 1px solid black,
okay?

67
00:04:36.537 --> 00:04:41.217
So it looks this div here, right?

68
00:04:41.217 --> 00:04:46.220
Has got no padding or margin on it.

69
00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.125
So let's look at the children.

70
00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:54.369
Border: 1px solid blue.

71
00:04:58.208 --> 00:05:01.014
Okay, so our paragraphs, as we knew,

72
00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:04.933
we actually want a little bit
of space in between them.

73
00:05:04.933 --> 00:05:10.254
And the way the paragraphs are set up
inside of the browser, they have margin.

74
00:05:10.254 --> 00:05:15.487
They have one rem of margin on the top,
one rem of margin on the bottom.

75
00:05:15.487 --> 00:05:18.972
Here's something else that they
don't teach you in boot camp.

76
00:05:18.972 --> 00:05:24.294
1 plus 1 equals?

77
00:05:24.294 --> 00:05:25.018
&gt;&gt; One?

78
00:05:25.018 --> 00:05:25.626
&gt;&gt; One.

79
00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:29.804
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Okay, when it comes to margin,

80
00:05:29.804 --> 00:05:32.725
and you have two paragraphs here,

81
00:05:32.725 --> 00:05:37.776
you want those two paragraphs
to be one rem apart, not two.

82
00:05:37.776 --> 00:05:39.335
When you start your paragraph,

83
00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:42.112
though you still wanna have
some space up here on the top.

84
00:05:42.112 --> 00:05:47.057
So padding, 1 rem plus 1 rem equals?

85
00:05:47.057 --> 00:05:48.546
&gt;&gt; One.

86
00:05:48.546 --> 00:05:51.943
&gt;&gt; 1 rem plus 1 rem on
padding vertically equals?

87
00:05:51.943 --> 00:05:55.766
&gt;&gt; 2
&gt;&gt; 2 rem, so that is additive,

88
00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:58.689
margin collapses, okay?

89
00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.399
And the larger number wins.

90
00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:07.846
So 2 rem plus 1 rem in
margin equals 2 rem, okay?

91
00:06:07.846 --> 00:06:08.390
Yeah, I know.

92
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.384
[LAUGH] Dinesh is going, no.

93
00:06:11.384 --> 00:06:16.971
So what we can do here then is say for

94
00:06:16.971 --> 00:06:22.367
our .main-text p, we could say

95
00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:28.164
something like margin-top: 0.

96
00:06:28.164 --> 00:06:33.497
And when we do that, the top margin
goes away but we still have space

97
00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:38.940
between our paragraphs,
because the bottom margin still exists.

98
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.048
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; That explains it.

99
00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:47.680
&gt;&gt; Yeah, crazy craziness.

100
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.304
Okay, and then, of course,
you can turn off your borders and

101
00:06:50.304 --> 00:06:51.525
it will look much prettier.

102
00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:57.753
And that is why you
always put borders on it,

103
00:06:57.753 --> 00:07:01.878
cuz it will tell you where the issue is,
all right?

104
00:07:01.878 --> 00:07:05.184
So that is gonna give you two columns
of text and one column of image.

105
00:07:05.184 --> 00:07:07.137
Everybody good so far?

106
00:07:07.137 --> 00:07:11.772
All right, suggestions for how we might go
about then making three columns of text

107
00:07:11.772 --> 00:07:13.464
with the image on the bottom?

108
00:07:17.018 --> 00:07:18.928
Anybody have any ideas?

109
00:07:18.928 --> 00:07:21.762
&gt;&gt; Image takes the whole section.

110
00:07:21.762 --> 00:07:24.326
&gt;&gt; Right,
image has to take the whole section.

111
00:07:24.326 --> 00:07:26.454
&gt;&gt; Change the grid template again?

112
00:07:26.454 --> 00:07:28.930
&gt;&gt; You're gonna need to change
the grid template again.

113
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.857
But guess what we're gonna do this time?

114
00:07:31.857 --> 00:07:35.821
Article {display: block}.

115
00:07:35.821 --> 00:07:39.266
So now, we're back to display blocks.

116
00:07:39.266 --> 00:07:42.544
Here's the image down here on the bottom,
yeah?

117
00:07:42.544 --> 00:07:46.918
Here's our main text, going all the way
across the screen, and our headline,

118
00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:47.971
up here on the top.

119
00:07:47.971 --> 00:07:53.032
So just cuz you started with grid doesn't
mean you have to stay with it, okay?

120
00:07:53.032 --> 00:07:56.364
So now, all we have to do is
disable what we put in place.

121
00:07:56.364 --> 00:08:02.293
So our .maintext,
what are we gonna do with this?

122
00:08:02.293 --> 00:08:05.067
&gt;&gt; Three columns
&gt;&gt; Columns: 3.

123
00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.558
So easy.

124
00:08:08.558 --> 00:08:13.059
Aah, so nice and perfect for
those larger screens, right?

125
00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:15.738
So now,
when you get to those giant screens,

126
00:08:15.738 --> 00:08:18.990
you can set up your articles
to have multiple columns.

127
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.914
It makes the screen look more filled,
but it's still easy enough to read.

128
00:08:23.914 --> 00:08:27.883
&gt;&gt; And
if you have the max-width setting, and

129
00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:32.076
the margin auto,
that will fix all the sizes.

130
00:08:32.076 --> 00:08:35.335
&gt;&gt; And you have dealt with,
yeah, your large screens, yeah.

131
00:08:35.335 --> 00:08:39.411
&gt;&gt; If your screen is so wide that you sort
of run out of text to fill three columns,

132
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:41.880
would you just make three
very short columns?

133
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:46.399
&gt;&gt; Yes, you could, or you could make two,
put the image next to it.

134
00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:50.479
&gt;&gt; What will this default to though,
if we don't give it something to do?

135
00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:56.102
&gt;&gt; Well, we gave this a max-width of 1200
pixels, and I'm at 1206 right there.

136
00:08:56.102 --> 00:08:58.124
But it would continue to go larger, and

137
00:08:58.124 --> 00:09:00.591
you'd wind up with extra
space on either side.

138
00:09:00.591 --> 00:09:04.320
Yeah, okay, so to fix this image then,

139
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.613
all we have to do is turn
off what we did before.

140
00:09:08.613 --> 00:09:13.244
So .article-img-wrapper,

141
00:09:13.244 --> 00:09:19.936
we're gonna set the max-width to 100%.

142
00:09:19.936 --> 00:09:24.676
We can set a height to 500px.

143
00:09:24.676 --> 00:09:26.902
Aah, so lovely.

144
00:09:26.902 --> 00:09:31.144
And then, we can give it
a little bit of breathing room,

145
00:09:31.144 --> 00:09:35.223
margin-top: 3rem,
give us a little space there.

146
00:09:35.223 --> 00:09:38.453
And it looks like I still have a little
bit of space over here on the side.

147
00:09:38.453 --> 00:09:45.718
So let me just change margin-top
to margin: 3rem 0 0 0.

148
00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:50.019
Which will zero out anything
else that I have there, and

149
00:09:50.019 --> 00:09:52.501
just set my top margin to 3rem.

150
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:54.088
And there's my last layout.

151
00:09:56.696 --> 00:09:58.817
How fabulous is that?

152
00:09:58.817 --> 00:10:00.354
&gt;&gt; Clever.

153
00:10:00.354 --> 00:10:01.907
&gt;&gt; Super amazing.

154
00:10:01.907 --> 00:10:05.396
And, of course, as we go back and
we slide through this,

155
00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:08.086
we go from two columns of text and
the image,

156
00:10:08.086 --> 00:10:13.061
to one column of text plus the image, to
the image on top and the text underneath.

157
00:10:16.461 --> 00:10:20.104
&gt;&gt; Since we used display as block.

158
00:10:20.104 --> 00:10:21.015
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

159
00:10:21.015 --> 00:10:26.109
&gt;&gt; All the previous grid columns
are not supported for the image.

160
00:10:26.109 --> 00:10:27.862
&gt;&gt; For the largest-
&gt;&gt; For the largest point.

161
00:10:27.862 --> 00:10:29.529
&gt;&gt; That the largest breakpoint.

162
00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:32.779
Often, I set display block for
the mobile part of it, and

163
00:10:32.779 --> 00:10:36.660
then turn on grid or Flexbox later
to blank word columns on the page.

164
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.803
But the point of this is that
you can also do the reverse.

165
00:10:39.803 --> 00:10:44.250
We actually wanted it earlier but
we don't want it later, yeah.

166
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.218
Okay, how are we doing so far?

167
00:10:48.218 --> 00:10:53.279
&gt;&gt; In the later breakpoints,
when you have the same selector and

168
00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:59.413
two different breakpoints, does
the older one get wiped out completely,

169
00:10:59.413 --> 00:11:04.104
or only the properties that
you mentioned in the nuance?

170
00:11:04.104 --> 00:11:05.483
&gt;&gt; Such a great question.

171
00:11:05.483 --> 00:11:09.124
Okay, so let's just look at
article here going through this.

172
00:11:09.124 --> 00:11:12.039
So we know that in the base,
we didn't actually style the article,

173
00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:13.277
so there's nothing there.

174
00:11:13.277 --> 00:11:14.713
I won't even open it.

175
00:11:14.713 --> 00:11:18.040
Here, we start with
article here in mobile.

176
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.985
We have a padding set, a max-width,
a margin, and the display grid, right?

177
00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:26.359
All of that carries into
this next breakpoint, but

178
00:11:26.359 --> 00:11:30.365
we change the values of
grid-template-columns, right?

179
00:11:30.365 --> 00:11:34.063
So now, two columns instead of one, but we
still have a max \-width, and a padding,

180
00:11:34.063 --> 00:11:34.686
and a margin.

181
00:11:34.686 --> 00:11:38.664
When we go to our next breakpoint,
we change the number of columns again,

182
00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:41.247
all that other stuff is still holding,
right?

183
00:11:41.247 --> 00:11:45.842
Because these are min-width, so everything
is continuing to cascade through.

184
00:11:45.842 --> 00:11:49.987
We never turn off those styles
that came before, all right?

185
00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:53.744
And then, when we get down here,
article is now display: block.

186
00:11:53.744 --> 00:11:58.640
But we still have that padding in place,
the max-width of 1200 pixels, and

187
00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.795
all the rest of it.

188
00:11:59.795 --> 00:12:01.227
&gt;&gt; But by changing display,

189
00:12:01.227 --> 00:12:04.617
now it's ignoring all of the grid
instructions from before?

190
00:12:04.617 --> 00:12:05.247
&gt;&gt; Correct,

191
00:12:05.247 --> 00:12:10.220
because grid-template-columns means
nothing unless the display is set to grid.

192
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:14.062
By setting it to block, we've canceled
out all of those other styles.

193
00:12:14.062 --> 00:12:15.815
So it's very efficient.

194
00:12:15.815 --> 00:12:19.391
&gt;&gt; So this is something we
defined on the 600 px1, and

195
00:12:19.391 --> 00:12:21.501
then overwrote at a higher one.

196
00:12:25.053 --> 00:12:28.419
And I guess I'm struggling
to articulate the question,

197
00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:30.742
but I think I'm with Andrew too there.

198
00:12:30.742 --> 00:12:33.699
Just like,
how do we know what gets taken over?

199
00:12:33.699 --> 00:12:37.880
Is it simply the largest screen, the
largest media breakpoint gets listened to,

200
00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.011
or is it the last bit
of code that we wrote?

201
00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:41.610
&gt;&gt; The answer to that is yes.

202
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:46.013
[LAUGH] But all of those things are true.

203
00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:50.724
So in this particular case,
we have this appearing last.

204
00:12:50.724 --> 00:12:54.094
They're all article, the selector is
exactly the same all the way through.

205
00:12:54.094 --> 00:12:57.584
Starting off in block,
which is the default browser value,

206
00:12:57.584 --> 00:12:58.889
we then set it to grid.

207
00:12:58.889 --> 00:13:02.736
And now, here at the end,
we put in this min-width of 500 pixels and

208
00:13:02.736 --> 00:13:07.441
we're saying to display grid again, after
we said display block at 1000 pixels.

209
00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:08.762
&gt;&gt; So this is grid display.

210
00:13:08.762 --> 00:13:09.886
&gt;&gt; This is grid display.

211
00:13:09.886 --> 00:13:13.221
You can see there's our three columns
of text plus the image over here.

212
00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:13.780
&gt;&gt; Okay.

213
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:16.888
&gt;&gt; So
&gt;&gt; So it is the latest thing.

214
00:13:16.888 --> 00:13:20.720
It's the old JavaScript thing of something
gets overwritten later, or something?

215
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:22.727
&gt;&gt; And again, it depends.

216
00:13:22.727 --> 00:13:27.652
It still depends, because there were
ways that I could make this not work,

217
00:13:27.652 --> 00:13:29.300
and work, and so forth.

218
00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:34.264
But the easiest way to do this so that
you get the least confused [LAUGH] and

219
00:13:34.264 --> 00:13:38.838
that makes the most sense,
is to put your media queries in order.

220
00:13:38.838 --> 00:13:42.035
So they get progressively larger.

221
00:13:42.035 --> 00:13:44.250
So that you're overriding things stepwise.

222
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:46.940
Does that help?

223
00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:47.464
&gt;&gt; Yes, it does.

224
00:13:47.464 --> 00:13:52.507
&gt;&gt; Okay, this is also a useful property if
you ever do anything with printing, and

225
00:13:52.507 --> 00:13:57.265
you wanna have columns in your printing
just so that you take up less paper.

226
00:13:57.265 --> 00:13:59.377
You can include these as a print style.

227
00:14:02.476 --> 00:14:05.260
Something to file away, yeah.
