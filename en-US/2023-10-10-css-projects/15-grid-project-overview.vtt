WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.840
Let's move on to the next one.

2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.870
So, we're going on to 3.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.020
The Wacky Grid.

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.113
Okay, so as you can see here for
the Wacky Grid.

5
00:00:12.113 --> 00:00:14.140
We're gonna start with mobile.

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.340
We have a bunch of images
stacked on top of each other.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.270
We're gonna go to a tablet where
we've got our images side by side.

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.689
One big one in the middle.

9
00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.820
And the we go on to this weirdo layout,

10
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.690
they sort of look like they're
kinda thrown in space, don't they?

11
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.610
Okay, so
let's look at these one at a time.

12
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.570
Anyone wanna make a comment
about this particular design?

13
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.880
What is one of the things that
stands out about this design?

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.110
&gt;&gt; One column and six rows.

15
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.650
&gt;&gt; Okay, one column, six rows.

16
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.100
What else?

17
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.990
&gt;&gt; Everything identical size.

18
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.620
&gt;&gt; Everything's an identical size,
including the height.

19
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.830
That should bring to mind that object fit,
object cover trick, right?

20
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.560
Object position thing.

21
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.518
Okay, so somehow we're gonna have to
do that to make everything the same

22
00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.640
height and the same width.

23
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.840
So, that should be relatively
straightforward, right?

24
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.310
Okay?

25
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.885
Then we go to one like this.

26
00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:09.900
What's going on here?

27
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.960
&gt;&gt; Coffee imposter in the middle.

28
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.351
&gt;&gt; Yes,
the coffee imposter is in the middle.

29
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:20.011
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; We've rearranged the croissant picture

30
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.554
from the bottom to the middle.

31
00:01:21.554 --> 00:01:22.096
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

32
00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:26.200
&gt;&gt; And
we've made it bigger taking up to columns.

33
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.800
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

34
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.125
So, the croissant.

35
00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:30.140
This is the source order for the webpage.

36
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.676
So, this is the order that the pictures
are in the text and everything.

37
00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:35.980
Croissants at the bottom here.

38
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:42.014
But, when we get to our tablet, we've
put the croissant in the middle, okay?

39
00:01:42.014 --> 00:01:47.190
So, now we have to do something with our
grid cells right for the layout here.

40
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.007
Okay, and
then we get to the whacked out one.

41
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:54.520
And this is not really obvious
what's going on here, right?

42
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.451
It's totally not possible, doesn't it?

43
00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:01.800
[LAUGH] How on earth could you
make images do this weird thing?

44
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.030
Only by accident, right?

45
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.280
&gt;&gt; It looks like maybe you might
have an odd number of columns.

46
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

47
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.443
&gt;&gt; And
be sort of staggering what appears where.

48
00:02:16.443 --> 00:02:17.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

49
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.000
&gt;&gt; Look less gritty.

50
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.060
&gt;&gt; There you go.

51
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.200
So, rather than saying, well,
we have two images here.

52
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.430
This obviously must be two columns, right?

53
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.360
Does it have to be?

54
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.960
No, you could have many more
columns than that, right?

55
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.348
So, here's a hint for you.

56
00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:38.023
Here's a 12-column grid system.

57
00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:41.890
These were very popular in
the bootstrap days, okay?

58
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.570
So, here's your 12-column grid system and
here are your images underneath.

59
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.178
That should give you a hint about
how this might be done, right?

60
00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:55.760
Your images are spanning various cells and
rows here as you go along the way.

61
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.650
But fortunately,
we don't start with desktop, do we?

62
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.958
What do we start with?

63
00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.480
No, no, not mobile.

64
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.182
What do we start with?

65
00:03:07.182 --> 00:03:09.780
Semantic HTML.

66
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.220
Shame on you.

67
00:03:12.582 --> 00:03:16.600
Okay, so we start with semantic HTML.

68
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.740
So, let's go ahead and do that first.

69
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.884
There's make time for coffee.

70
00:03:23.884 --> 00:03:25.990
[LAUGH] There it is.

71
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.520
I've given you links to all of
the images here inside of code pen.

72
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.224
So, what I'm gonna need for you to do
is to mark this up appropriately, and

73
00:03:35.224 --> 00:03:38.073
we'll talk about it in a moment,
all right?

74
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:44.000
All right.

75
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.520
So, how did everybody do
with the semantic HTML?

76
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.970
Good?

77
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.012
Fantastic, tell me about what you did for
your code?

78
00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.971
Yeah, Andrew.

79
00:03:56.971 --> 00:04:00.030
&gt;&gt; I put absolutely
everything in a wrapper.

80
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.420
&gt;&gt; Everything should go in a wrapper,
okay?

81
00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.240
And what element did you use for
your wrapper?

82
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.542
&gt;&gt; Div.
&gt;&gt; You can use a div.

83
00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:09.078
I use a section for my wrapper,

84
00:04:09.078 --> 00:04:12.571
because I felt like this was all
kind of vaguely related information.

85
00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:15.200
So, might be some sort of
homepage layout kind of thing.

86
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.268
But, you can certainly use a div
as well that would be okay.

87
00:04:18.268 --> 00:04:19.489
What else?

88
00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.417
How did you mark up make time for coffee?

89
00:04:23.417 --> 00:04:27.890
&gt;&gt; Put that all in an H1 put coffee
in the span class with fancy text.

90
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:28.640
&gt;&gt; Yep.

91
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.605
&gt;&gt; But, I also put that in what
I call the card div as well.

92
00:04:33.605 --> 00:04:38.118
Because, I know that going forward,
we know that that make time for

93
00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:42.370
coffee had the same size
as the images themselves.

94
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.950
So, I noticed, maybe, they'll all
wanna be in the same kind of wrapper.

95
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
you put another wrapper around your H1?

96
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.467
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I called it little card.

97
00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:51.618
&gt;&gt; Little card, okay.

98
00:04:51.618 --> 00:04:54.040
[LAUGH] All right.

99
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.210
I did not put my H1 in that, but
that is something to think about.

100
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.460
We'll follow that away when
we get to our mobile layout.

101
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.260
We might wanna put a div around that.

102
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.629
And then for each of the images,

103
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:08.710
you're gonna need to put a div
around each one of your images.

104
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.270
So, we have the image itself
with the image element, right?

105
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.890
The source I gave you and then,
hopefully, you all put in Alt text.

106
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.540
Shame, shame if you did not.

107
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.678
Put in your Alt text.

108
00:05:20.678 --> 00:05:23.283
And then around each one of
those I put a div with and

109
00:05:23.283 --> 00:05:26.540
I gave mine a class of
image hyphen wrapper.

110
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.100
You might have called your something else,
okay?

111
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.978
So, the markup is really
not terribly semantic.

112
00:05:31.978 --> 00:05:35.126
[LAUGH] Also not terribly difficult.

113
00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:39.760
Because, the challenge here is
really gonna be on the grid true.

114
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.950
Okay, fantastic.
