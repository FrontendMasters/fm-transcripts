00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.583
What comes after?

2
00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:04.929
We talked about the layouts,
we marked it up.

3
00:00:04.929 --> 00:00:06.283
What's step three?

4
00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:09.634
&gt;&gt; Mobile
&gt;&gt; Mobile, so

5
00:00:09.634 --> 00:00:12.554
that is the next thing to work on.

6
00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:17.650
So just to remind you what this is
going to look like, here's the mobile.

7
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.488
So we have some things that are going
on here for the mobile, yes?

8
00:00:23.488 --> 00:00:27.527
Right now we have our vanilla
background with our coffee text.

9
00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:32.799
Notice that, we are going to a coffee
background with vanilla text, okay?

10
00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.897
That's one of the things
you're gonna have to change.

11
00:00:34.897 --> 00:00:38.267
And then somehow you're going to need to
make all those images the same height.

12
00:00:41.064 --> 00:00:43.262
And this is gonna be for mobile designs.

13
00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:45.818
What did I say here in the project?

14
00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:50.215
This will be less than 675 pixels.

15
00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:53.072
All right, so go on ahead and start.

16
00:00:57.863 --> 00:01:01.909
All right, so hopefully you did
well there with that mobile stuff.

17
00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.789
And let's go on through how we put
together this particular layout.

18
00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:11.641
So remember that here in our mobile
layout, we have this coffee background and

19
00:01:11.641 --> 00:01:12.902
we have white text.

20
00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:17.403
That white text is centered, so
let's go through and get that in place.

21
00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:21.766
So we're gonna start by changing
our body background color.

22
00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:26.594
Now, one of the things you certainly could
do is you could go into your base styles

23
00:01:26.594 --> 00:01:29.084
and you could make a change here, right?

24
00:01:29.084 --> 00:01:31.434
Where it says the background
color is vanilla,

25
00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:33.323
you could switch that over to coffee.

26
00:01:33.323 --> 00:01:38.135
The reason I'm not doing that is,
in real life, if this was actually, say,

27
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:42.875
a multi-page website, we may want those
base styles to apply to every other

28
00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.788
page on the site and
this page is an exception.

29
00:01:45.788 --> 00:01:50.305
Because this is kind of gonna be
eventually e a homepage kind of layout.

30
00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:55.766
So here, I am just gonna override it
by putting in a body style again.

31
00:01:55.766 --> 00:02:01.838
So I will say that the background-color

32
00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:05.768
is var(--coffee) and

33
00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:11.303
the h1 that is gonna be on this page is

34
00:02:11.303 --> 00:02:17.746
going to be color: var(--vanilla).

35
00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.850
So there it is.

36
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.582
And if I make this a little bit smaller,
you'll see that the text is not centered.

37
00:02:28.582 --> 00:02:34.993
So one of the things that I might
do is say text-align: center,

38
00:02:34.993 --> 00:02:38.210
which will center it so pretty.

39
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.456
Okay, then we have our wrapper that
goes all the way around everything.

40
00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:45.548
Once again,

41
00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:51.420
you can flatten up your HTML here just
to get the structure of the page.

42
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.233
So you can see that we have a wrapper
that goes all the way around everything.

43
00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:03.733
And that wrapper, we might want
to put in some margin on this,

44
00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:10.608
2rem auto, so that will give us
a little bit of space on the top and

45
00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:15.000
the bottom and center us automatically.

46
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.405
And you can do padding of 0 2rem,

47
00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:24.050
that will get us off the edges
of the browser here, okay?

48
00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.498
Awesome, Now, for our image wrappers,

49
00:03:29.498 --> 00:03:34.021
remember we have a wrapper
around each one of those images.

50
00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:38.965
We are gonna use that to give us
a little bit more space in between

51
00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:42.617
our individual images, so .imagewrapper.

52
00:03:42.617 --> 00:03:47.017
Let's say our margin on
the bottom is 1rem, so

53
00:03:47.017 --> 00:03:50.767
that'll push those apart a little bit.

54
00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:53.512
And then the last thing that
we would need to do now is,

55
00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:56.627
remember our images are all
different heights and so forth.

56
00:03:56.627 --> 00:04:00.635
One of the things notably we had in
this design was equal height images.

57
00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:06.172
So to make that magic happen,
we'll wanna do for

58
00:04:06.172 --> 00:04:10.232
these images, img-wrapper img.

59
00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:17.486
We'll do a width of 100% a height of 100%,

60
00:04:17.486 --> 00:04:21.377
and object-fit of cover.

61
00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:25.184
That alone isn't really going
to change anything here.

62
00:04:25.184 --> 00:04:30.639
But when we go to our image wrapper up
here on the top, we can say our height

63
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:36.468
is something like 200px, and
that'll make everything an equal height.

64
00:04:36.468 --> 00:04:38.042
If you like that, you can keep it.

65
00:04:38.042 --> 00:04:42.684
You can always play around with this
a little bit, make it 250 instead.

66
00:04:42.684 --> 00:04:45.811
If you like that better,
you can have that, whatever you wanna do.

67
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:52.109
As I was saying to one of the students
earlier, I didn't give you Figma files, so

68
00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:53.750
there really is no exact spec here.

69
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.584
I don't expect you to be
measuring all of these and

70
00:04:56.584 --> 00:05:00.375
making sure that you are exactly
picture-perfect the same as me.

71
00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:02.096
Just something close,

72
00:05:02.096 --> 00:05:07.611
the edges of the image are off the the
edges of the screen, that kinda thing.

73
00:05:07.611 --> 00:05:09.397
So that wasn't too terrible.

74
00:05:09.397 --> 00:05:14.176
That was all things that we've
probably heard before, right,

75
00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:16.220
had to do with that, okay?

76
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.760
Yay, nice.
