00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.518
All right, so

2
00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:05.768
the next one we're gonna do is a super fun
layout that is taken from my real life.

3
00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:12.327
I actually worked this problem for
one of my employers.

4
00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:16.750
So this is going to be a team page,
where we're going to have pictures

5
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.887
of the people on our team,
we're gonna make them round, okay?

6
00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:25.680
And then we have these icons here that are
gonna go to their various social media.

7
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.330
And underneath that we have their name and
their title, okay?

8
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.603
Notice that some people have three icons,
some have two, that one has one, okay?

9
00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:41.058
So there are all kinds of different
numbers of icons here on these images.

10
00:00:43.368 --> 00:00:48.649
And so that is pretty much the primary
goal of this particular layout,

11
00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.972
is to try to achieve this right here,
okay?

12
00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:57.566
Then after that, we have additional
layouts associated with that.

13
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:02.750
We basically put two in a row, and
then on desktop, we put three on a row.

14
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.222
So that should be pretty easy for
you at this point in time.

15
00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:09.550
But achieving the layouts
here in the middle,

16
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.060
how do we get these icons
here on top of the image?

17
00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.584
That is more difficult,
does anybody have any suggestions or

18
00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:20.375
observations about what we see here?

19
00:01:23.158 --> 00:01:27.498
&gt;&gt; So z-indexing?

20
00:01:27.498 --> 00:01:32.955
&gt;&gt; There's a z-index property that
might be involved, right, what else?

21
00:01:32.955 --> 00:01:34.773
And what does the z-index property do?

22
00:01:37.588 --> 00:01:40.716
&gt;&gt; Words, the depth of the image and

23
00:01:40.716 --> 00:01:45.146
whatever elements you're putting on there
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

24
00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:46.718
moving things in and out of the screen.

25
00:01:46.718 --> 00:01:53.156
So we need to make sure that our icons are
on top of the image, not behind it, right?

26
00:01:53.156 --> 00:01:54.963
Okay, what else?

27
00:01:54.963 --> 00:01:56.933
&gt;&gt; Absolute positioning on the icons.

28
00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.880
&gt;&gt; Absolute positioning on the icons.

29
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.378
Okay, so that becomes tricky.

30
00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:04.581
How many of you know about
absolute positioning?

31
00:02:05.668 --> 00:02:09.209
No clue, awesome, okay, great.

32
00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.875
Well, we'll talk about that.

33
00:02:10.875 --> 00:02:14.278
Other observations,
how do we make images into circles?

34
00:02:14.278 --> 00:02:16.992
Anybody have an idea of how to
make an image into a circle?

35
00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:17.550
&gt;&gt; Border radius.

36
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.605
&gt;&gt; Border radiuses.

37
00:02:19.605 --> 00:02:20.205
&gt;&gt; One.

38
00:02:20.205 --> 00:02:22.101
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You know that trick.

39
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:26.221
Border radius of 50%, right?

40
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:30.017
And that assumes that we
start with a square image,

41
00:02:30.017 --> 00:02:35.503
what happens if we put on a border
radius of 50% on a rectangular image?

42
00:02:35.503 --> 00:02:40.180
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; He'll get an egg, right?

43
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.115
One way or the other you get an egg.

44
00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:45.859
[LAUGH] Make sense?

45
00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.332
If it doesn't, you should find yourself
a rectangular image and try it out, okay?

46
00:02:50.332 --> 00:02:55.595
Fortunately, I've done that work for
you, I've made them squares, okay?

47
00:02:55.595 --> 00:02:59.879
&gt;&gt; Could you use the objects,
what we're learning about before?

48
00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.007
&gt;&gt; You absolutely could.

49
00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:01.676
&gt;&gt; Okay.

50
00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:03.322
&gt;&gt; You absolutely could.

51
00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:06.884
Okay, what else about this?

52
00:03:06.884 --> 00:03:09.039
Anybody wanna make
a comment on the markup?

53
00:03:15.087 --> 00:03:18.589
&gt;&gt; Are you gonna have links inside of it?

54
00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:23.577
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, those icons all have to
have links that are gonna go somewhere,

55
00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:24.120
right?

56
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.810
Which I have said to you,

57
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.766
you don't have to really spend
a whole lot of time on that.

58
00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:34.456
But in real life, they would absolutely
have links that would go to Instagram,

59
00:03:34.456 --> 00:03:36.701
LinkedIn, or Mastodon, what else?

60
00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:47.434
Okay, so if we think about
our figure element again,

61
00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:52.179
the figure element is designed to group
a whole bunch of things together, right?

62
00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:55.940
So if we have a figure element,
we have our image of the person, right,

63
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.468
inside of the figure, well,
what would go in our figure caption?

64
00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.602
&gt;&gt; Is it the name and the title?

65
00:04:02.602 --> 00:04:05.158
&gt;&gt; Person's name, their titles, and

66
00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:09.584
all of the links to the social
media in those icons, right?

67
00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:11.888
All that goes in the figure caption.

68
00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:14.810
And then we're gonna use absolute
positioning to move things out of there.
