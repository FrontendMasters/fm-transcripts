00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.661
Okay, so
how did you do with the semantic HTML?

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:08.493
hopefully everybody did okay because
you know there's like 130 HTML

3
00:00:08.493 --> 00:00:13.572
elements that are out there and
you might know 10 of them if you're lucky.

4
00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:17.612
So this might be a place where you're
gonna learn a whole lot of things that you

5
00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:19.510
didn't know about HTML.

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.496
So the first thing that I'm going to do
here in my CodePen is I'm actually going

7
00:00:24.496 --> 00:00:29.403
to hide the whole web page as much as I
can, because it doesn't matter how this

8
00:00:29.403 --> 00:00:32.975
looks, we are concentrating
on the the semantic HTML.

9
00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:35.873
And it doesn't matter
what the CSS looks like,

10
00:00:35.873 --> 00:00:39.065
because we are concentrating
on the semantic HTML.

11
00:00:39.065 --> 00:00:43.730
We are communicating what it
is we want this page to say.

12
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.790
So for the people here in the room,
tell me a little bit about what kind

13
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.953
of elements did you use in putting
together your semantic HTML, yes.

14
00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.200
&gt;&gt; I'll take the easy one.

15
00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.830
So I put instant coffee facts inside of
a header and I put that inside of an H1.

16
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.400
&gt;&gt; Great.

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.110
&gt;&gt; And then to get the instant with the
fancy text, I put that inside of a span.

18
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.382
&gt;&gt; Awesome, yes,
just like we did with the style guide, so

19
00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:12.875
we have a header for our web page.

20
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:15.920
The header is introducing a title here for

21
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.630
this web page in case it's
Instant Coffee Facts for whatever reason.

22
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.400
Other semantic elements that you
used here in your page, anybody?

23
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.521
&gt;&gt; I used just what you mentioned
just there and then h2 for

24
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:34.094
the header of the coffee instantly,

25
00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:39.370
coffee convenience title of the article,
and then all I used paragraphs.

26
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.829
&gt;&gt; And then, some paragraphs.

27
00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.764
Okay, so a little bit about this.

28
00:01:43.764 --> 00:01:48.052
So, first of all, one of the things that
you want to be sure when you're working

29
00:01:48.052 --> 00:01:52.350
with HTML for accessibility reasons is,
quote, don't skip heading levels.

30
00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.821
You've probably heard this before, don't
skip heading levels, what does that mean?

31
00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.870
Anybody know what that means,
don't skip levels?

32
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.358
You've never heard of that,
that was just great, yes.

33
00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:08.934
&gt;&gt; So don't skip heading levels so that
would be like the header and then having

34
00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:14.168
like article and then h1 h2, because for
people who use things like screen readers.

35
00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.038
&gt;&gt; Right
&gt;&gt; That will kind of tell them what

36
00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:20.765
part of the website they're hearing or
reading.

37
00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:24.997
&gt;&gt; Correct, so yeah, we wanna be sure that
we're using these semantic elements in

38
00:02:24.997 --> 00:02:29.495
order for the page to be summarized
correctly for screen readers and so forth.

39
00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:34.070
But specifically, when you hear don't skip
headings, this means that we're gonna have

40
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.790
an h1, we're gonna have an h2,
we're gonna have an h3.

41
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.575
That kind of thing, we're not going
to go from h1 to h4, for example,

42
00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:47.688
because we like the size of the h4 better,
or the styling for the h4 better.

43
00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:50.570
What did we actually do
to address that issue?

44
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.325
We know semantically it has to be an h2,
but

45
00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:58.940
we want it to look like an h4,
how would we do that?

46
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.020
&gt;&gt; CSS
&gt;&gt; We do it with CSS, right?

47
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.780
In our base styling, remember when we
put together our base styling here?

48
00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.700
We came up with classes.

49
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.740
So if I want my h1 to look like an h3,
what could I do?

50
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.556
I can use my h3 class, and
apply it to my h1 element.

51
00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:24.390
Make sense?

52
00:03:27.834 --> 00:03:33.880
I'll say it again, so if I will have an
h1, semantically, that's what is required.

53
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.790
But it wanted to visually look like my h3.

54
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.127
I use my h1 element h1, and

55
00:03:41.127 --> 00:03:45.727
then I have a class which equals my h3.

56
00:03:45.727 --> 00:03:49.996
So it pulls in the h3 styling,
overriding whatever I had for

57
00:03:49.996 --> 00:03:55.980
the element h1, because classes
beat elements, right, make sense?

58
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.674
That's why we did this
here in our base styling.

59
00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:06.261
Okay, little tips like that all right so

60
00:04:06.261 --> 00:04:06.952
yes
&gt;&gt; So

61
00:04:06.952 --> 00:04:10.757
what we're accomplishing by
that is having all of the h1,

62
00:04:10.757 --> 00:04:13.117
h2s layout in a logical order
&gt;&gt; Correct

63
00:04:13.117 --> 00:04:14.985
&gt;&gt; And then that is consumed by

64
00:04:14.985 --> 00:04:16.566
screen readers
&gt;&gt; Correct

65
00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:17.430
&gt;&gt; That makes sense

66
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.598
&gt;&gt; And Google, yes,

67
00:04:18.598 --> 00:04:23.282
because headings are super important for
search engine optimization too.

68
00:04:23.282 --> 00:04:26.388
If you want a machine to understand
the structure of this page,

69
00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:29.692
you have to write it so
a machine will understand it.

70
00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:33.545
And that is done through HTML,
that's why HTML is important,

71
00:04:33.545 --> 00:04:36.470
that's why we use semantic HTML.

72
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.513
I will die on this hill [LAUGH] okay?

73
00:04:39.513 --> 00:04:43.241
So we start with our h1 there for
the page, and

74
00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.216
then I have this set up as an article.

75
00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:51.907
I didn't use div, I didn't use section,
I use article, why did I use article?

76
00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.288
&gt;&gt; It's correct semantically
&gt;&gt; Presumably it's correct semantically,

77
00:05:00.288 --> 00:05:03.570
but what else,
why is it correct semantically?

78
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.524
&gt;&gt; Let someone using a screen reader
know that what they're about to

79
00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:13.800
consume is likely something
made up of multiple paragraphs.

80
00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.589
&gt;&gt; It might be something longer,
yeah, anything else?

81
00:05:18.825 --> 00:05:24.908
&gt;&gt; Okay, so articles specifically is
something that might be syndicated.

82
00:05:24.908 --> 00:05:29.884
If we had no other context for this chunk
of text, could we still read it and

83
00:05:29.884 --> 00:05:31.260
get value out of it?

84
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.100
Yes, it has a title,
it has some blah blah, right?

85
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.990
That could stand alone as its
own separate piece of text.

86
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.190
That is the definition of an article.

87
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.663
We could put it in an RSS feed, we could
syndicate it out to other websites,

88
00:05:46.663 --> 00:05:47.670
make sense?

89
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.588
So that is why we choose article,
sections are just related information.

90
00:05:53.194 --> 00:05:57.600
Div has no semantic meaning
to it whatsoever, okay?

91
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.200
Okay div is just, we need to apply
a class somewhere on this page.

92
00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.730
Section is the stuff is related,
article is it can be syndicated.

93
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.856
So the question I always ask related or
syndicated,

94
00:06:11.856 --> 00:06:16.736
related or syndicated,
related or syndicated?

95
00:06:16.736 --> 00:06:17.803
Make sense?

96
00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:18.608
You said a section for related stuff.

97
00:06:18.608 --> 00:06:25.356
&gt;&gt; Section for related,
article for syndicated, okay?

98
00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:28.211
So then obviously after
that we got our h2 and

99
00:06:28.211 --> 00:06:30.778
then we have a bunch of paragraphs blah.

100
00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:34.743
Then down here towards the bottom we have
our image, which I might have given you.

101
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.540
Did I give you the image?

102
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.393
Yeah, there isn't anything you need to
do here with the image, it's just there.

103
00:06:44.096 --> 00:06:51.120
And then we have a footer,
the footer is a footer of the article.

104
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.710
Notice it's not a footer for the webpage.

105
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.791
What is the difference between a footer
for a webpage and a footer for an article?

106
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.265
First of all, did you know that you
could have a footer for a web page and

107
00:07:02.265 --> 00:07:05.200
a footer for an article,
probably not, right?

108
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.879
Okay, so an article can
potentially have its own header or

109
00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:10.760
it can have its own footer
depending on how you set it up.

110
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.296
Think about a new site, you might have
a header that would have the title and

111
00:07:15.296 --> 00:07:18.899
the authors and the dateline and
all the rest of that stuff.

112
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.990
The footer could be used for
references for that article.

113
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.905
In this case, we're referring
to where this content came from,

114
00:07:25.905 --> 00:07:27.071
which is from Wikipedia.

115
00:07:29.986 --> 00:07:31.684
So this is specific to the article,

116
00:07:31.684 --> 00:07:34.290
therefore this is a footer
inside of our article.

117
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.576
This is not a footer for the webpage,
which has copyright information and

118
00:07:37.576 --> 00:07:40.400
lower navigation and
all the other things, right?

119
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.477
So, there's a difference between
footer for the webpage and footer for

120
00:07:43.477 --> 00:07:44.360
your article.

121
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.613
In this particular case, in our footer,
we have a paragraph of information here,

122
00:07:49.613 --> 00:07:53.830
and this is from the article,
it was called Instant Coffee.

123
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.353
We include a citation,
which is from Wikipedia, and

124
00:07:58.353 --> 00:08:03.881
we state who created the picture,
which is a link back to the pixel

125
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:09.021
site to give him proper credit for
his picture, make sense?

126
00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:15.329
Any questions on the semantic HTML?

127
00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:18.045
&gt;&gt; I'm not familiar with target.

128
00:08:18.045 --> 00:08:21.980
&gt;&gt; Okay, so Target has to do with
how this link is going to open.

129
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.469
If we don't include target when you click
the link it'll open in the same window

130
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:27.483
that you're in.

131
00:08:27.483 --> 00:08:29.590
Target equals underscore blank,

132
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.948
the underscore needs to be there means
that it will open in a new window or

133
00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:39.590
a new tab So
it has to start with an underscore.

134
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.425
If you just have target equals quote
blank, without the underscore,

135
00:08:44.425 --> 00:08:47.150
you're opening it in a tab
with the name of blank.

136
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.368
Which means that if somebody went through
here and clicked both of these links,

137
00:08:52.368 --> 00:08:55.079
you would wind up with one tab,
it would open the first link and

138
00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:57.134
then that same tab would
open the second link.

139
00:08:57.134 --> 00:08:59.106
When you use underscore blank,

140
00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:03.640
it will have two separate tabs with
the two separate pieces of information
