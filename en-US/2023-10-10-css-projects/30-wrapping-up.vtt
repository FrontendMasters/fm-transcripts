00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.344
So congratulations everybody,

2
00:00:02.344 --> 00:00:06.634
you've managed to make it through all
of the layout projects here for CSS.

3
00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:10.278
Now if you're interested in taking
all of this stuff to the next level,

4
00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:14.305
we have one final page here on the website
that will talk about some next steps.

5
00:00:14.305 --> 00:00:18.525
So one of the things that you can do would
be to assemble a full web page using

6
00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:19.990
the layouts provided.

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.530
So we've coded a lot of parts of webpages,
but

8
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.030
we haven't actually put this
together into a full site.

9
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.809
So could you take that third layout
that we did with the wacky grid and

10
00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:31.347
turn that into a homepage?

11
00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:34.530
Could you set up an actual full team page?

12
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.604
You'll need to add a navbar and
a footer to this, probably,

13
00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.180
in order to make it look
like a full website.

14
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.813
But you should be able to do that, either
through some of my other Frontend Masters

15
00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:49.060
courses that you have watched that will
allow you to see that kind of thing.

16
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.158
You can also apply this exact four-part
approach to your future work.

17
00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:58.697
When you go to work tomorrow,

18
00:00:58.697 --> 00:01:02.530
apply this four-part approach to
everything that you do going forward.

19
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.879
This is not just a thing for school, it
is in fact the way the real world works.

20
00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:10.798
You always start with looking at your
designs, thinking about pitfalls,

21
00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:15.042
how you're gonna mark it up, what is
the information you're trying to convey?

22
00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:18.707
Do your semantic HTML markup,
do your mobile layout,

23
00:01:18.707 --> 00:01:23.646
then add on the breakpoints one at a time
until you run out of breakpoints to

24
00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:25.570
set up the rest of your page.

25
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.328
I have links here to my other courses at
Frontend Masters if you'd like to take

26
00:01:30.328 --> 00:01:31.760
a look at those.

27
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.876
They will give you more information
about layouts with Flexbox and Grid,

28
00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:36.600
I have a whole course on that.

29
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.320
My Getting Started with CSS course
will walk you through putting together

30
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.460
a portfolio website.

31
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.155
That's something else that might
be of interest to many of you.

32
00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:48.026
And as I've mentioned,
the Intermediate HTML and CSS course.

33
00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:51.860
We'll talk a lot about weird
selectors that we use today.

34
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.550
We'll talk about the cascade and
inheritance and other aspects of CSS.

35
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.400
And then finally, at the end here,
I have a few references.

36
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.331
These are things that we mentioned today
that you might wanna know more information

37
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:10.660
about, including the complete guides
to Grid and Flexbox at CSS Tricks.

38
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.975
It addition to additional
reading on cascade layers or

39
00:02:14.975 --> 00:02:18.840
whether a perfect view port size exists.

40
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.470
So be sure to take a look at that
last page here in the course website.

41
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.198
And I hope to see you again in
a future course at Frontend Masters.

42
00:02:27.198 --> 00:02:34.214
