1
00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:01.658
We've talked about the layout.

2
00:00:01.658 --> 00:00:03.464
We've done our semantic HTML.

3
00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.335
What's our next step?

4
00:00:06.335 --> 00:00:08.181
Mobile design.

5
00:00:08.181 --> 00:00:14.222
So be sure you take a look
at our mobile layout.

6
00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:19.555
Now, this is going to be
at less than 475 pixels.

7
00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:23.109
And we have our cards stacked on
top of each other just like this.

8
00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.354
Not too terribly different than
what we have all ready, okay?

9
00:00:27.354 --> 00:00:30.068
So be sure to take a look at that.

10
00:00:30.068 --> 00:00:36.816
We're going to set up
that mobile layout here.

11
00:00:36.816 --> 00:00:40.763
Be sure that you're setting
your windows small enough,

12
00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:46.695
something less than 475 pixels to give you
a sense of how this is gonna go together.

13
00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.119
And I will give you the answer here.

14
00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:57.150
All right, so hopefully you did
well with that mobile layout.

15
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.900
So a few things to keep in mind as
you're working on that mobile layout.

16
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.997
We have our article with a class of card.

17
00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:07.019
Remember what our direct children are.

18
00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:09.782
We have an h2,
we have a div with class of card-image and

19
00:01:09.782 --> 00:01:13.772
we actually have two paragraphs, our
first paragraph and our second paragraph.

20
00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:15.838
The first paragraph contains text.

21
00:01:15.838 --> 00:01:20.235
The second paragraph is containing
my link for the order button.

22
00:01:20.235 --> 00:01:23.654
So we have a bunch of things that we're
gonna need to get styling here, so

23
00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:24.506
let's get to it.

24
00:01:24.506 --> 00:01:29.334
If you take a look at the way that
our page is laid out right now

25
00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:34.164
at this narrow dimension,
it almost looks like what we're

26
00:01:34.164 --> 00:01:39.009
trying to achieve here with
a few minor exceptions, okay?

27
00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.189
So let's just go on through how
we're gonna put that together.

28
00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:46.366
So for our card h2,

29
00:01:52.003 --> 00:01:58.691
Margin will wind up being 4rem 0 1rem 0.

30
00:01:58.691 --> 00:02:01.213
So that'll give us a nice
fat space at the top,

31
00:02:01.213 --> 00:02:03.748
it'll give us a skinnier
space at the bottom.

32
00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:07.702
Remember, vertical margins collapse.

33
00:02:07.702 --> 00:02:11.383
So at the bottom of our first card,
we will have 1rem of space,

34
00:02:11.383 --> 00:02:13.962
at the top of our next card, we'll have 4.

35
00:02:13.962 --> 00:02:16.364
And 4 plus 1 is?

36
00:02:16.364 --> 00:02:17.787
&gt;&gt; 4.
&gt;&gt; 4, exactly,

37
00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:23.153
because the larger number is going to win
and we'll just collapse those heights.

38
00:02:23.153 --> 00:02:29.255
So my font size is a little bit big here,
so I'm going to change that.

39
00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:32.875
Font size is var(--h3),

40
00:02:32.875 --> 00:02:37.749
just to reduce that size a little bit, and

41
00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:42.354
then we can say text-align: center.

42
00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:44.127
So there we go.

43
00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:47.209
We have our little
headings here on the page.

44
00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.580
Now, for the image itself,
.card-image img.

45
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.620
We're gonna do our usual trick here.

46
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.289
So I am going to set the width to 100%,

47
00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:11.891
height to 100%, and

48
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.288
object-fit: cover.

49
00:03:16.288 --> 00:03:20.916
That's to make sure that our image
is gonna stretch all the way

50
00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:22.616
across the page here.

51
00:03:22.616 --> 00:03:28.927
The other thing I need to do
is set our border-radius to 0.

52
00:03:28.927 --> 00:03:33.714
That way, the corners of the image before,
when it was set to 5 pixels,

53
00:03:33.714 --> 00:03:37.716
you can see that we have just
this tiny little gap over there,

54
00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:41.268
will drive your designer
friends absolutely crazy.

55
00:03:41.268 --> 00:03:44.102
So set that border radius to 0, and

56
00:03:44.102 --> 00:03:49.017
now your image will go all the way
across the page very nicely.

57
00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:53.741
Okay, and then on the actual .card image,

58
00:03:56.492 --> 00:04:03.086
Itself, we can say a min-height of 200px.

59
00:04:05.458 --> 00:04:12.461
So they have to be at least 200
pixels tall, but they can be taller.

60
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:17.937
card p, remember, this is gonna apply
to both our button and our paragraph.

61
00:04:17.937 --> 00:04:23.882
card p,
we can give this a line-height of 1.5rem,

62
00:04:23.882 --> 00:04:29.193
or sorry, 1.5,
no units on our line height.

63
00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:35.535
padding: 2rem 2 rem 0 2rem.

64
00:04:35.535 --> 00:04:40.020
Actually want this to be on the top,
the left, the right, but not the bottom.

65
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.718
I don't wanna have a giant space
here in between my paragraph and

66
00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.552
my button on the bottom.

67
00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:52.164
My margin on those paragraphs,
those should be 0, very nice.

68
00:04:52.164 --> 00:04:57.388
And the color of the text is all set,
coffee.

69
00:04:57.388 --> 00:05:00.769
And then the last part is,
here inside of our last paragraph,

70
00:05:00.769 --> 00:05:03.445
remember we have a link
with the class of button.

71
00:05:03.445 --> 00:05:08.765
So, here we will set our
button class here, and

72
00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:15.150
we can set our font-family
to var(--decorative).

73
00:05:17.798 --> 00:05:21.971
So that'll change us to
the Montserrat font,

74
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:28.288
our font-size to var(--h5),
just make it a little bit bigger.

75
00:05:28.288 --> 00:05:29.555
display, block,

76
00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:34.463
we actually want to be sure that we
can work with the padding, the margin,

77
00:05:34.463 --> 00:05:39.311
and I actually do want this button to
stretch all the way across the page.

78
00:05:42.394 --> 00:05:48.613
Padding: 0.75rem, you won't really see
this until I put the border on it.

79
00:05:48.613 --> 00:05:55.738
So let me put the border on it,
border: 2px solid var(--coffee).

80
00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:05.293
Okay, text

81
00:06:05.293 --> 00:06:11.089
decoration of none,
get rid of the unsightly underline,

82
00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:15.952
and we can center that,
text-align: center.

83
00:06:15.952 --> 00:06:22.031
We can make this uppercase,
text-transform: uppercase.

84
00:06:27.296 --> 00:06:33.873
And border-radius, var(--radius).

85
00:06:36.471 --> 00:06:40.077
Ooh, such a pretty button, right?

86
00:06:40.077 --> 00:06:42.424
So we don't have our hover state yet.

87
00:06:42.424 --> 00:06:47.278
The other thing is,
my text may be green there, so

88
00:06:47.278 --> 00:06:51.590
let me set the color to var(--coffee).

89
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.344
It's really hard to tell the difference
between that hunter green and

90
00:06:54.344 --> 00:06:57.050
the coffee color, but
I think I've got it now.

91
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.681
So brown text, brown border, and

92
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:04.960
we'll just let the vanilla come
through for the rest of that button.

93
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.096
Then all we have to do is set our
hover state, so our .button:hover.

94
00:07:12.096 --> 00:07:13.549
We'll just swap the colors.

95
00:07:13.549 --> 00:07:15.336
Always a really easy thing to do.

96
00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:17.960
If you're not really quite sure
what to do with your buttons,

97
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.277
just swap the colors on hover.

98
00:07:19.277 --> 00:07:24.658
So our background color
will become var(--coffee).

99
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:34.030
And the color will be var(--vanilla),

100
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.033
so we can still read it.

101
00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:40.541
And I think that's all we need to do.

102
00:07:40.541 --> 00:07:44.133
So when I roll my mouse over it,
now I have a coffee-colored button.

103
00:07:46.081 --> 00:07:49.431
Okay, and because we've done
such a nice job with our markup.

104
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:53.042
All of these are all done,
you just have to style one.

105
00:07:53.042 --> 00:07:56.908
All the rest of the cards
are all styled accordingly.

106
00:07:56.908 --> 00:07:59.662
We could probably do with some
padding down there at the bottom of

107
00:07:59.662 --> 00:08:00.431
the page though.

108
00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:05.826
So let's go back up to, I guess

109
00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:11.006
I haven't styled my card container yet.

110
00:08:11.006 --> 00:08:18.099
So let's put the .card-container
up here at the top.

111
00:08:18.099 --> 00:08:21.593
And I can just say margin-bottom: 4rem,
and

112
00:08:21.593 --> 00:08:26.915
that will give us a little bit of space
down here at the bottom of the page so

113
00:08:26.915 --> 00:08:30.348
that our button doesn't
run into the bottom.

114
00:08:30.348 --> 00:08:32.631
And we have space up there at the top.

115
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:39.035
Okay, so hopefully that was
relatively straightforward, okay?

116
00:08:39.035 --> 00:08:42.039
So we didn't do anything with layouts,
basically.

117
00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:47.060
In this particular first example, all
we've done is just a lot of padding and

118
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.928
margin, a few colors, turning on and
off border radiuses, and setting up

119
00:08:51.928 --> 00:08:56.977
our initial button, which is gonna
stretch all the way across our page here.
