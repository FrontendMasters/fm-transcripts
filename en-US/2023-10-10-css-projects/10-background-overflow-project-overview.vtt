1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.818
All right, great, so let's move on then.

2
00:00:03.818 --> 00:00:07.132
Woo, we're going on to
the second challenge.

3
00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:10.761
We're going on to backgrounds and
overflow, okay?

4
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:13.215
So this is another crazy one.

5
00:00:14.893 --> 00:00:19.954
And I think, well, let's see.

6
00:00:19.954 --> 00:00:21.156
Let me show it to you this way.

7
00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:28.103
Instead of showing you the screenshots,
Let's just start here.

8
00:00:31.423 --> 00:00:33.218
And let's go to Full Page View.

9
00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:36.184
Okay, so
here's the way this one is gonna work.

10
00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:44.798
So when we're at small screen sizes,
we're going to have a scroll bar here.

11
00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:46.597
And we can scroll over and

12
00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:51.746
see all of the various kinds of images
that we have here in place, okay?

13
00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:56.897
And I will give you a little hint, this
is a standard browser scroll bar, okay?

14
00:00:56.897 --> 00:00:58.817
Cuz there's no JavaScript in this.

15
00:00:58.817 --> 00:01:03.470
Obviously, one of the things that you
could do to take this to the next level is

16
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.406
put in some JavaScript and
give it some arrows and

17
00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:11.151
make it a little nicer looking, but
this is just a horizontal scroll bar here.

18
00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:16.215
And then when we get to a larger size,

19
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.811
Now we got rid of all
those images somehow.

20
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:24.574
We have our numbers here.

21
00:01:24.574 --> 00:01:25.376
We have a picture.

22
00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:29.755
And we have some text and so
forth over here on the side.

23
00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:35.015
And when we get to the even larger
size here, Look at that image.

24
00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:39.062
Notice how that image moves, right?

25
00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:43.812
So this is what we're gonna see
here at larger screen sizes.

26
00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:52.569
So let's talk about it,
What do you see here in the mobile view?

27
00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.331
Anybody wanna talk about what you see here
in the mobile view of things you have to

28
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:58.052
consider?

29
00:01:58.052 --> 00:02:03.444
&gt;&gt; Everything in the single column,
all stacked.

30
00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:09.894
But if it is over the display, the scroll
bar is automatically up here and

31
00:02:09.894 --> 00:02:12.844
then we scroll and see the items
&gt;&gt; And

32
00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:15.398
we're gonna have scroll to see the items,
yeah.

33
00:02:15.398 --> 00:02:18.800
So somehow, we have to set all of
those items up individually and

34
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.146
then we have to make them go such
that we can scroll side to side.

35
00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:24.418
Make sense?

36
00:02:24.418 --> 00:02:27.170
What styles can we reuse
that we already have?

37
00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:30.793
&gt;&gt; fancy-text.

38
00:02:30.793 --> 00:02:32.077
&gt;&gt; fancy-text.

39
00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:34.396
Yeah, so there, that's already done.

40
00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:36.708
We just apply fancy-text there.

41
00:02:36.708 --> 00:02:38.918
What is worrying you at this point?

42
00:02:38.918 --> 00:02:42.420
What are you looking at and going,
my gosh, I have no idea how to do that?

43
00:02:44.057 --> 00:02:46.143
&gt;&gt; Make sure the scroll bar shows up.

44
00:02:46.143 --> 00:02:48.805
&gt;&gt; Make sure the scroll bar shows up,
yeah?

45
00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:53.155
&gt;&gt; I'm interested,
cuz I've run into this problem before,

46
00:02:53.155 --> 00:02:58.201
the problem of actually ensuring
that the last thing that's visible

47
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:03.948
on your screen isn't completely visible so
the user is encouraged to scroll.

48
00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:08.083
So I'm wondering if there's something in
the code that determines that it will

49
00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:10.497
actually spill over,
force it to spill over.

50
00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:13.154
&gt;&gt; Okay, I think if you just
make things big enough,

51
00:03:13.154 --> 00:03:17.160
you'll find that it will magically do
that, cuz this is for tiny screens.

52
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.408
If we were doing this on desktop,

53
00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:20.819
I would completely understand
what you're talking about, but

54
00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.870
this is a small enough screen that I think
it's gonna it's gonna happen for you.

55
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.902
You won't have to worry too
much about that, other points?

56
00:03:26.902 --> 00:03:30.085
&gt;&gt; See the paragraphs is not.

57
00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:35.083
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we had a paragraph of information
somewhere which is no longer here.

58
00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:38.216
So we've got things appearing and
disappearing, right?

59
00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:43.695
Okay, let's take a look at the tablet one.

60
00:03:43.695 --> 00:03:47.518
Talking about things that are appearing
and disappearing, what's going on?

61
00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:52.273
&gt;&gt; Paragraph text appears,
but only for the main one.

62
00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:57.083
&gt;&gt; Only for the first one,
what else happened?

63
00:03:57.083 --> 00:03:58.802
&gt;&gt; Justify to the end of the number.

64
00:03:58.802 --> 00:04:01.788
While the image in there
is justified to the header.

65
00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:04.602
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
we're gonna have something going on here.

66
00:04:04.602 --> 00:04:05.960
Yeah, what else?

67
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.299
&gt;&gt; Extra content is in a separate section,
or

68
00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.882
maybe section below the main content
instead of scrolling to the side.

69
00:04:14.882 --> 00:04:17.045
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we got that going on.

70
00:04:17.045 --> 00:04:20.714
Nobody's mentioning this image here,
what happened to it?

71
00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:23.212
&gt;&gt; I assume it's available with
the extra content when you click on

72
00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:24.053
the header for that.

73
00:04:24.053 --> 00:04:28.014
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're just doing HTML and CSS.

74
00:04:28.014 --> 00:04:31.989
So yeah, in JavaScript, you could make
things appear and disappear on click.

75
00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:34.702
We don't have an onclick in CSS,
that's not a thing.

76
00:04:34.702 --> 00:04:37.402
So you don't have to worry about that, but

77
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:42.136
somehow you're gonna have to hide
those images, right, in here, okay?

78
00:04:42.136 --> 00:04:46.402
And then for our max-width.

79
00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:50.735
&gt;&gt; Very similar to the last one, except
moving that bottom content to a side.

80
00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:53.427
&gt;&gt; Move the bottom content to the side,
right?

81
00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:58.147
Take that and
now we're gonna put it next to that

82
00:04:58.147 --> 00:05:03.701
information to take up more
room horizontally, okay?

83
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:07.994
So this is kinda crazy.

84
00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:10.196
So here's a couple of
things to think about.

85
00:05:10.196 --> 00:05:14.832
So usually when working with CSS layouts,
we have flexible widths on each cell.

86
00:05:14.832 --> 00:05:19.269
Units like percents or rems or
fr, that fraction unit or vw,

87
00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:23.274
does it ever make sense to use
a fixed width in a layout?

88
00:05:26.832 --> 00:05:28.871
&gt;&gt; In this case, yes.

89
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:33.767
&gt;&gt; Look at those numbers,
what do you think about those numbers?

90
00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:36.306
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

91
00:05:36.306 --> 00:05:39.242
they kinda all have the same widths,
don't they?

92
00:05:39.242 --> 00:05:43.489
They're always a skinny width,
not really a fraction.

93
00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:48.491
So you may wanna play around with some
another units of measure for those.

94
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:52.530
And you might also wanna
have a range of widths.

95
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.920
Sometimes things can get too wide, okay?

96
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.930
So there's some hints and spoilers
here if you wanna take a look at them.

97
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.133
And I'll just point out that I've given
you some next level ideas, right?

98
00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:05.265
How could you load the content?

99
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:10.156
You need to achieve each layout at each
breakpoint rather than loading it all and

100
00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:13.889
turning it on and off,
which is what we're going to do here.

101
00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:18.776
And of course, you could also think about
some JavaScript to make that mobile

102
00:06:18.776 --> 00:06:23.134
version look a little bit nicer too
if you wanted to go next level, but

103
00:06:23.134 --> 00:06:24.583
I won't go over that.

104
00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:28.213
So we now talked about these designs and
looked at them and thought about them,

105
00:06:28.213 --> 00:06:29.314
what's our next step?

106
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.263
&gt;&gt; HTML.

107
00:06:32.263 --> 00:06:33.837
&gt;&gt; Semantic HTML.

108
00:06:33.837 --> 00:06:36.187
So that is the next thing
you're going to do.

109
00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.772
Here's your starting CodePen.

110
00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:41.301
I've given you, once again,

111
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:45.142
here's your base styles that we
wrote in our first exercise.

112
00:06:45.142 --> 00:06:49.987
You'll see here, there's all of the text,
and I've given you the images as well.

113
00:06:49.987 --> 00:06:52.513
How will you mark these up?

114
00:06:52.513 --> 00:06:55.302
So go on ahead and
see if you can mark these up.

115
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:04.129
All right, so let's take a look at
the HTML and how we mark this up.

116
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.738
So everybody here in the room,
how did we start?

117
00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:09.352
&gt;&gt; The header.

118
00:07:09.352 --> 00:07:10.655
&gt;&gt; We started with the header.

119
00:07:10.655 --> 00:07:14.961
Yay, looks kind of familiar.

120
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:21.989
Header is up here at the start,
slash header at the end, okay?

121
00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:26.200
And what did we do in
between the header tags?

122
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.950
&gt;&gt; h1.

123
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.534
&gt;&gt; h1, that's definitely an h1.

124
00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:34.277
And what else?

125
00:07:34.277 --> 00:07:36.036
&gt;&gt; We have a span for the fancy-text.

126
00:07:36.036 --> 00:07:38.755
&gt;&gt; Span for
the fancy-text around the word five.

127
00:07:38.755 --> 00:07:46.196
So span class="fancy-text", Five.

128
00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:49.918
Awesome.

129
00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:53.640
Okay, good.

130
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.538
All right, so then there's the rest of it.

131
00:07:55.538 --> 00:08:01.274
[LAUGH] Okay, so what do you guys think?

132
00:08:01.274 --> 00:08:05.385
I'm gonna focus on just marking up
one card because all the rest of them

133
00:08:05.385 --> 00:08:07.974
are gonna be exactly the same, make sense?

134
00:08:07.974 --> 00:08:13.989
Okay, so clearly,
we need to have a bunch of cards, right?

135
00:08:13.989 --> 00:08:17.111
How did you mark up those cards?

136
00:08:17.111 --> 00:08:20.562
&gt;&gt; First, by separating it out and
putting it all in a div.

137
00:08:20.562 --> 00:08:22.428
&gt;&gt; So you put a div here?

138
00:08:22.428 --> 00:08:23.877
&gt;&gt; Yeah, around the outside of things.

139
00:08:23.877 --> 00:08:26.883
&gt;&gt; Okay, and
did you give a class to that or anything?

140
00:08:26.883 --> 00:08:28.031
&gt;&gt; I actually didn't yet, but I assume.

141
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:29.003
&gt;&gt; Okay.

142
00:08:29.003 --> 00:08:33.485
&gt;&gt; There should be something, because
that would determine its own boundaries

143
00:08:33.485 --> 00:08:34.178
&gt;&gt; Great, so

144
00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:38.955
you called this div with a class of
wrapper that started all those things.

145
00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:42.870
And then down at the very end,
you put in a slash div, right?

146
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:43.951
&gt;&gt; You're getting ahead of me.

147
00:08:43.951 --> 00:08:44.610
That was smarter.

148
00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.621
No, I was thinking of a wrapper for
each individual card.

149
00:08:46.621 --> 00:08:49.369
But you're right, we do need something for
all of them to be put into.

150
00:08:49.369 --> 00:08:50.996
&gt;&gt; Okay, so we need both of those things.

151
00:08:50.996 --> 00:08:52.830
We need one that goes around everything.

152
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.251
So there's our div with
a class of wrapper.

153
00:08:55.251 --> 00:09:01.061
And then around each card,
we also need to have some kind of item.

154
00:09:01.061 --> 00:09:05.534
And these are not,
they're kind of vaguely related, right?

155
00:09:05.534 --> 00:09:10.869
Those are related, headline and
an image and a paragraph of text.

156
00:09:10.869 --> 00:09:13.281
They're not syndicated, right?

157
00:09:13.281 --> 00:09:16.159
They're not really stand-alone.

158
00:09:16.159 --> 00:09:20.593
So my sense of this was that a div
is just fine here because it's

159
00:09:20.593 --> 00:09:24.190
really not communicating
a whole lot of meaning.

160
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:28.376
This is kind of one of those patterns
that you might find on a news website,

161
00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:32.847
that would be our top five articles today
are these five things, or whatever.

162
00:09:32.847 --> 00:09:39.528
So I've just used a div
with a class of what?

163
00:09:39.528 --> 00:09:43.218
Something super creative like card?

164
00:09:43.218 --> 00:09:46.525
And that of course will end at each card.

165
00:09:46.525 --> 00:09:50.517
So slash div around each of those cards.

166
00:09:50.517 --> 00:09:53.126
What else did we know that was true?

167
00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:57.207
&gt;&gt; We need to separate out the number 1,
the numeral 1 there.

168
00:09:57.207 --> 00:10:02.208
&gt;&gt; We need to somehow separate this
number 1 from the heading, right?

169
00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:07.384
And the purpose of that separation
is just to stick a class on it.

170
00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:14.807
And if you put fancy-text here,
that would be fine.

171
00:10:18.262 --> 00:10:21.422
Slash div, something like that.

172
00:10:25.692 --> 00:10:26.708
&gt;&gt; Maybe eventually.

173
00:10:26.708 --> 00:10:30.828
&gt;&gt; Maybe eventually, or
what I actually did was I put

174
00:10:30.828 --> 00:10:35.055
in a class here of number,
because it's a number.

175
00:10:35.055 --> 00:10:38.937
[LAUGH] And we're gonna use
something like fancy-text, but

176
00:10:38.937 --> 00:10:42.599
there's some other styling
that goes with that, okay?

177
00:10:42.599 --> 00:10:47.960
And then after Coffee Shops Boost
Creativity, what do we say?

178
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.091
Heading 2, maybe.

179
00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.243
Remember, if it doesn't
look exactly as you want,

180
00:10:55.243 --> 00:10:58.093
you can always change that later
by adding a class to it, but

181
00:10:58.093 --> 00:11:01.011
the markup is an h2 cuz we have
an h1 at the start of the page.

182
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:03.625
So these should be h2s.

183
00:11:03.625 --> 00:11:09.264
We'll probably wind up putting
some kind of div around the image,

184
00:11:09.264 --> 00:11:11.993
class of card-image, right?

185
00:11:16.178 --> 00:11:19.358
Often, that's needed for styling purposes.

186
00:11:19.358 --> 00:11:21.226
And then we have our
paragraph of information.

187
00:11:21.226 --> 00:11:23.714
And then we have our slash div.

188
00:11:23.714 --> 00:11:27.458
So if you format HTML there,
it'll do all the indents for

189
00:11:27.458 --> 00:11:29.724
you right here inside of CodePen.

190
00:11:29.724 --> 00:11:33.492
Just a little drop-down window here,
it'll do that for you.

191
00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:38.794
Okay, so that is the pattern here for
the card.

192
00:11:38.794 --> 00:11:42.555
And you would continue that
pattern all the way down for

193
00:11:42.555 --> 00:11:45.596
the remaining two, three, four and five.

194
00:11:45.596 --> 00:11:48.826
It's gonna be exactly the same pattern,
but

195
00:11:48.826 --> 00:11:52.484
it is going to be just repeated over and
over again.

196
00:11:55.896 --> 00:11:57.440
Any questions on that?

197
00:12:02.101 --> 00:12:06.930
&gt;&gt; Is there any advantage to using the,
sorry, I'm forgetting, but

198
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:10.755
the image thing where we
have the built-in caption.

199
00:12:10.755 --> 00:12:13.261
I so apologize that I don't remember that
&gt;&gt; Figure.

200
00:12:13.261 --> 00:12:13.843
&gt;&gt; Figure.

201
00:12:13.843 --> 00:12:18.834
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, you could always
argue that maybe a figure makes

202
00:12:18.834 --> 00:12:21.384
sense somewhere along the way.

203
00:12:21.384 --> 00:12:22.502
You can certainly do that.

204
00:12:22.502 --> 00:12:25.243
I tend to use figure when
I have a caption, and

205
00:12:25.243 --> 00:12:27.200
I tend to use a div when I don't.

206
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.032
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

207
00:12:28.032 --> 00:12:30.282
&gt;&gt; Would you say this
paragraph fits like a caption.

208
00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:32.551
I suppose by your choice
you'd say not really?

209
00:12:32.551 --> 00:12:37.020
&gt;&gt; I'd say not really, because the article
titles Coffee Shops Boosts Creativity.

210
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.248
And then whether it's just enough noise or
the continuous stream of people,

211
00:12:40.248 --> 00:12:42.393
studies show that coffee
shops boost creativity.

212
00:12:42.393 --> 00:12:44.969
So that's the deck, the introduction.

213
00:12:44.969 --> 00:12:45.974
&gt;&gt; Sure, sure.

214
00:12:45.974 --> 00:12:48.382
&gt;&gt; And
there's probably a read more link in here,

215
00:12:48.382 --> 00:12:50.495
even though I haven't put one in, yeah.
