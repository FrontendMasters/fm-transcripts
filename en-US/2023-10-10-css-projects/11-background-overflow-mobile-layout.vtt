00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.466
We talked about our designs,
we wrote our semantic HTML.

2
00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:03.883
Now what do we do?

3
00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:04.980
&gt;&gt; Create the mobile.

4
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.750
&gt;&gt; Create the mobile layout, right?

5
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.350
Are you guys getting this now?

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.550
Okay, so the next thing to do
is create the mobile layout.

7
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.140
The mobile layout is going to be this
weird side-scrolling kind of thing.

8
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.541
So as you think about this and
you wanna approach it, so first of all,

9
00:00:23.541 --> 00:00:28.870
if you can get just the card layouts done,
that is totally awesome.

10
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.348
If you can't figure out how to
make them go horizontal and

11
00:00:31.348 --> 00:00:34.580
have the scroll bar,
don't worry about that part.

12
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.050
You should at least aim to
get the card layout done.

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.124
The next thing to do would be to get
the cards to layout across the page and

14
00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:46.417
a default looking scroll bar, okay.

15
00:00:46.417 --> 00:00:49.560
And then the last thing to do would
be to see if you can actually style

16
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.790
the scroll bar.

17
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.373
And I've given you a hint for
that in the hints and

18
00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:57.594
spoiler alerts section of the webpage if
you wanna take a look at that article and

19
00:00:57.594 --> 00:00:59.486
figure out how that styling works.

20
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.750
All right, so

21
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.690
this one's a little bit trickier
than the one that we just worked on.

22
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.820
So let's think through this
in a little bit more detail.

23
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.970
So what we have going on here is
we have a series of cards, right?

24
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.990
We have card one, card two, and
so forth on down the screen.

25
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.840
Each card has a layout, and then we
have a layout for all of the cards.

26
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.630
So, we actually have two
problems that are going on here.

27
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.510
We need to do a layout for each card,
and then a layout for all of the cards.

28
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.280
So let's start with the layout for
the individual card.

29
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.110
And the way that we're gonna
set that up is as follows.

30
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.833
Let's start with our card.

31
00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:56.970
Now what we're gonna have to do is
put that number next to our headline.

32
00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.831
And as we can see in our design here,
that number is big and

33
00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:06.610
it's got a fancy boarder on the bottom,
and it needs to go next to that headline.

34
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.320
So how are we going to
go about doing that?

35
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.311
Here's how we can do that,
we can set this up to display grid and

36
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:20.720
then we can say that our
grid template columns.

37
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.570
And remember what I told you here,
you don't have to always say FRs.

38
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.680
It's not always FRs is the right answer.

39
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.230
Often it is because we want four equally
sized columns to equally sized columns.

40
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.876
But here we want one narrow column for
our number and one fat column for

41
00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:39.890
everything else.

42
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.154
And so the way I set this
up was I did 30 pixels for

43
00:02:44.154 --> 00:02:47.490
one column, that will be the number.

44
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.430
And then next to that, you probably would
say, well, 1FR or something like that.

45
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.220
But I did this instead.

46
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:05.580
I did minmax 250 pixels, 600 pixels.

47
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.860
So, what does that mean?

48
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.790
&gt;&gt; Anywhere between the range.

49
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.930
&gt;&gt; Right, don't go any smaller than 250,
don't go any larger than 600.

50
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.780
So, that'll give us a little
bit of flexibility here.

51
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.650
Now, our page looks kind of weird [LAUGH].

52
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.863
What's going on here?

53
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:31.920
I've given it two columns, right, I gave
it 30 pixels and the fat not one and

54
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.777
if we take a look at the markup for
one card just focus on one card.

55
00:03:36.777 --> 00:03:40.035
Here's our div with a number,
here's our h2,

56
00:03:40.035 --> 00:03:45.170
here's our class our card image and
here's our paragraph, right?

57
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.459
So this is gonna distribute,
the number goes in the first column,

58
00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.880
the h2 in the second column.

59
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.320
That's what we want.

60
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.974
Then the image goes in the first column,
and

61
00:03:55.974 --> 00:03:58.730
the paragraph goes in the second column.

62
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.733
That's not what we want [LAUGH] okay.

63
00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:05.363
So now we have to tell the image
where we want it to go,

64
00:04:05.363 --> 00:04:07.660
in fact all of these things.

65
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.730
So what we might do then at that point to
get this layout working is as follows.

66
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.742
I actually did this, grid template rows,

67
00:04:21.742 --> 00:04:24.750
repeat, 2, auto.

68
00:04:27.272 --> 00:04:32.050
And what that does is,
it will separate us into two rows.

69
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.150
And again, automatically,
it's gonna make more than two rows for us.

70
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.623
But ultimately, what this will do is
we can have our number occupy the first

71
00:04:42.623 --> 00:04:47.601
column, and then everything else will show
up in the second column in the same row.

72
00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:52.251
So let me show you how that works, for

73
00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:58.708
our number where is that
going to display exactly?

74
00:04:58.708 --> 00:05:02.301
&gt;&gt; First row.
&gt;&gt; First first column, first row, right.

75
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:10.084
Where's our card-image going to display?

76
00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:15.935
&gt;&gt; Last row, last column.

77
00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:21.860
&gt;&gt; Two-three, right?

78
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.530
So there it is.

79
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.170
There's our headline, there's our image,

80
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.985
now our paragraph is displaying over here
where in that first column again, right?

81
00:05:33.577 --> 00:05:38.894
So,
&gt;&gt; Shouldn't we just hide the paragraph?

82
00:05:38.894 --> 00:05:40.210
&gt;&gt; Sorry.

83
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.780
&gt;&gt; Shouldn't we just hide the paragraph,
cuz it's not in the screenshot?

84
00:05:43.855 --> 00:05:47.965
Yeah, that's right we're heading

85
00:05:47.965 --> 00:05:53.020
paragraph in this one so
card p display none.

86
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.563
Let's talk about that display
none here for a minute.

87
00:05:56.563 --> 00:06:00.444
[LAUGH] Okay display none good thing or

88
00:06:00.444 --> 00:06:03.990
bad thing, go [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Good, great, bad.

89
00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.552
&gt;&gt; Great, okay, great, bad.

90
00:06:05.552 --> 00:06:06.950
&gt;&gt; Potentially problematic.

91
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.100
&gt;&gt; Why would you say great thing?

92
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.469
&gt;&gt; Cuz often it's removed entirely from
the DOM, it's not being displayed at all,

93
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:18.326
so it doesn't have anything to do,
like none of its margins, borders,

94
00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:19.780
paddings stay behind.

95
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.565
Whereas if you were to set something
as invisible, it's position and

96
00:06:23.565 --> 00:06:26.440
everything would stay there,
sorry, invisible.

97
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.506
But if you were to have it.

98
00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:29.073
&gt;&gt; Yeah, visibility, none, yeah.

99
00:06:29.073 --> 00:06:31.800
&gt;&gt; Right, so
display none removes all that as well.

100
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.335
So it's not part of the layout.

101
00:06:33.335 --> 00:06:33.958
&gt;&gt; Sweet.

102
00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:36.481
&gt;&gt; Anything hidden is still
available to a screen reader though.

103
00:06:36.481 --> 00:06:37.187
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

104
00:06:37.187 --> 00:06:38.011
&gt;&gt; Or anything.

105
00:06:38.011 --> 00:06:39.098
&gt;&gt; Accessibility.

106
00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:43.130
&gt;&gt; Yeah, anything tackled this way
will still be read by a screen reader.

107
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:44.860
&gt;&gt; I think that's true, yes.

108
00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.310
You were gonna say bad,
is that the reason why?

109
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.960
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

110
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.067
&gt;&gt; Okay?
&gt;&gt; Accessibility,

111
00:06:49.067 --> 00:06:50.692
if it's not shown on the screen, but

112
00:06:50.692 --> 00:06:52.842
then it's still being used
by screen readers and

113
00:06:52.842 --> 00:06:56.970
people using that, then it might not be
the experience that you want them to have.

114
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.376
&gt;&gt; Absolutely true, and what would happen
if I had 500 paragraphs on the screen?

115
00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:05.480
&gt;&gt; Screener's never getting through.

116
00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.664
&gt;&gt; Screener is probably
never getting through it but

117
00:07:07.664 --> 00:07:10.270
also we start to wind run into
performance issues, right?

118
00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.995
So anything that we hide here is actually
still being loaded by the browser, but

119
00:07:14.995 --> 00:07:16.530
then not being displayed.

120
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:21.550
So if I had one megabyte images times 50
of those, and I just said display none.

121
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.022
I've downloaded 50 megabytes of
information that I am not even going to

122
00:07:25.022 --> 00:07:26.440
use in the display.

123
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.855
So ideally what you're gonna do here is
you're gonna come in with some kind of

124
00:07:29.855 --> 00:07:33.006
solution, where you're loading in
only the information that you need

125
00:07:33.006 --> 00:07:35.050
to display on the page.

126
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.150
But with HTML and CSS, we can't do that.

127
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.630
This is the best solution we come
up with with just HTML and CSS.

128
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:42.550
Makes sense, okay?

129
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.646
So that's why we're doing that today.

130
00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:47.200
&gt;&gt; I have a question related
to the screen reader.

131
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.012
If it is out of topic, stop me.

132
00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:51.484
&gt;&gt; Okay [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; No wait,

133
00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:53.250
when we make this comes off and.

134
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

135
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:59.577
&gt;&gt; Hey, what about the screen data so
do you have any work on it.

136
00:07:59.577 --> 00:08:04.241
But I am so so far I have not even
gone through one single screen

137
00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:08.724
reader accessibility thing but
in our development time,

138
00:08:08.724 --> 00:08:12.630
we dedicate so much time for
the screen reader.

139
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.580
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Then how do I balance that?

140
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.899
Is it like a best practice
to have a screenreader,

141
00:08:17.899 --> 00:08:20.810
but no one has used it for multiple years?

142
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:24.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But you dedicate your time on that.

143
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.880
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Do you have any perspective on that?

144
00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.490
&gt;&gt; As always,
this goes back to user research.

145
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:36.470
So what is the percentage of users who
are using screen readers on your site?

146
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:40.000
What are the readers
specifically that they're using?

147
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.614
And I think you're gonna find that there
are some that are very popular that you

148
00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:47.282
absolutely need to get to work, and there
are some that are not very popular that

149
00:08:47.282 --> 00:08:49.399
you probably can let
slide a little bit more.

150
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.196
But a lot of this goes back to legal
as well, because you work for target,

151
00:08:55.196 --> 00:09:00.400
that's a very large company and
they have to have an accessible website.

152
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:05.647
So yeah, so it depends and it depends on
legal things on which I am not a lawyer,

153
00:09:05.647 --> 00:09:08.047
and this is not legal advice [LAUGH].

154
00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:11.612
And then there's there's
the whole concept of like,

155
00:09:11.612 --> 00:09:14.560
how do we deal with development time?

156
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.030
This is actually the same question we used
to have with Internet Explorer six or

157
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.990
something, right?

158
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.585
How much time do we spend
supporting Internet Explorer 6?

159
00:09:22.585 --> 00:09:27.497
[LAUGH] It used to be that you
could spend 20% of your development

160
00:09:27.497 --> 00:09:32.340
time on every other browser and
80% on Internet Explorer 6.

161
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.040
So how critical was that?

162
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.740
So at some point you do have to call,
these are our edges.

163
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.694
This is what we're going to do,
however that math is done, yes.

164
00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:44.843
&gt;&gt; Just note we've got it this is
addressed a little bit in our we have

165
00:09:44.843 --> 00:09:46.570
a couple accessibility courses.

166
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.181
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
&gt;&gt; And

167
00:09:47.181 --> 00:09:51.130
also adding an enterprise
accessibility course soon.

168
00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.007
&gt;&gt; Perfect, yeah, so
there are accessibility courses and

169
00:09:55.007 --> 00:09:59.058
who will know much more than I
do about how this stuff works.

170
00:09:59.058 --> 00:10:03.992
Okay, so broadly speaking then, with
just this little bit of grid that we've

171
00:10:03.992 --> 00:10:08.460
added here, we've got our cards
kind of displaying as we want to.

172
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.940
The chunks of information
are in the right spots.

173
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:14.110
Now we just need to tweak these
a little bit to make them prettier.

174
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.660
So let's go back and do that.

175
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.677
So, for my card.

176
00:10:22.084 --> 00:10:27.700
I have a column gap as well,
column gap 1 rim.

177
00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.225
Okay, here for my number font family.

178
00:10:36.854 --> 00:10:39.188
Spell it right yes var decorative

179
00:10:43.881 --> 00:10:46.816
Okay, and

180
00:10:46.816 --> 00:10:52.690
my font size var h4.

181
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.310
I want it to be about that big.

182
00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:02.675
I reduced the lined height to 0.7,
that was through exhaustive testing.

183
00:11:02.675 --> 00:11:10.230
The color is var green.

184
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:15.720
The font size, look at that,
I put font size in twice.

185
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.910
I started with h4 and
then I made it an h2.

186
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.440
So there we go, h2.

187
00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.720
Text align center.

188
00:11:30.014 --> 00:11:34.700
Okay, and
then comes the fancy text part of this.

189
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:39.833
So, back in my base I have the fancy

190
00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:44.977
text styling here find it, okay.

191
00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:48.420
I'm gonna copy the fancy text styles and

192
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.477
I'm gonna paste them here into number,
okay.

193
00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:54.410
So not so good, right,

194
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:59.555
the fancy text styling here is
very separated from the number.

195
00:11:59.555 --> 00:12:05.669
So we need to fiddle around with
these numbers a little bit.

196
00:12:05.669 --> 00:12:11.885
What I found was 20% for the background
position was a good spot and

197
00:12:11.885 --> 00:12:15.971
the background size was 100% to 20%.

198
00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:23.580
So that looked pretty good there, okay?

199
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:29.697
Somebody had mentioned,
it was Ben, said our card image,

200
00:12:29.697 --> 00:12:34.768
we're gonna need to give that
image treatment thing to it again.

201
00:12:34.768 --> 00:12:41.329
So .cardimg, we set the width to 100%.

202
00:12:42.966 --> 00:12:48.248
The height to 100% and then object fit,

203
00:12:48.248 --> 00:12:54.526
cover to get it to fit there
on the screen my card h2,

204
00:12:54.526 --> 00:13:02.110
so a lot of this stuff is just
fiddly styling now, right?

205
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:10.604
Card h2, we have a font-size of var h4.

206
00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:18.586
That looks like it doesn't
quite work anymore,

207
00:13:18.586 --> 00:13:22.045
but let's stay with it,
add a margin of zero.

208
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:34.950
Okay, yes, the highlight there is
in the wrong spot, be patient.

209
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.360
Don't panic,
because we're not really quite done yet.

210
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.250
So what we've done here is we've
styled up this card, okay?

211
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.790
Now we need to put all the cards in a row.

212
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.530
So how would we go about doing that?

213
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.026
&gt;&gt; On the wrapper,
I tried display flex, but

214
00:13:53.026 --> 00:13:55.870
I'm not sure if that's where you wanna go.

215
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that's one way of doing it.

216
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.879
You could definitely do
display flex on that wrapper.

217
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.140
I always like to go to my HTML and
flatten it out like this.

218
00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:09.140
So there's all my cards,
and there's the wrapper.

219
00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.600
So you could definitely
do this with Flexbox.

220
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.990
You could also do this with grid.

221
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.339
I think I did it with grid, but,

222
00:14:15.339 --> 00:14:19.800
Flexbox would be a totally
legitimate answer as well.

223
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.779
So here we have our wrapper to ram,

224
00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:27.759
one ram, a little bit of padding,

225
00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:33.680
get it off the edges of the page,
margin zero auto.

226
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.928
You could also do your max width here.

227
00:14:43.987 --> 00:14:44.818
1200 pixels.

228
00:14:48.337 --> 00:14:51.302
All right, and then we're gonna,
I use display grid, but again,

229
00:14:51.302 --> 00:14:53.038
you could do this with Flexbox as well.

230
00:14:53.038 --> 00:14:57.278
Repeat, oops, grid,

231
00:14:57.278 --> 00:15:02.420
grid template columns.

232
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:07.630
We want repeat,
five columns, one FR piece.

233
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.547
Look at that, that's all it took.

234
00:15:11.547 --> 00:15:17.534
And notice that your highlight is
back to the right spot again, okay.

235
00:15:17.534 --> 00:15:21.692
Because we're using percents,
those highlights may jump up and

236
00:15:21.692 --> 00:15:24.000
down in space and time.

237
00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.330
So don't make any final adjustments.

238
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:30.350
Don't get them perfect and then add
another layer of styling to them and

239
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:34.980
then go now I have to redo the roll again
[LAUGH] okay, because it's relative.
