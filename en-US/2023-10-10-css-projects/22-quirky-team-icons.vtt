1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.710
Now, let's move on to the icons.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.160
So for our icons, we are gonna give
each icon a width and a height.

3
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.760
Width of 50 pixels and
a height of 50 pixels.

4
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.480
Why are we using fixed width and height?

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.723
What we wanna do is make
these an exact size,

6
00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:24.010
because eventually we're gonna
move them on top of the person.

7
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.390
We don't want them covering
up the person too much.

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.630
So, in this particular case,
we do want them to be about that size.

9
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.835
I'm gonna give this a background
color of var green.

10
00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:45.363
So, that will give us
our background color.

11
00:00:45.363 --> 00:00:50.390
And now,
we can give us some padding of 10 pixels.

12
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.920
So, we'll have a little
bit of space around.

13
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.700
Just like that.

14
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.388
So, you see when you put that on there.

15
00:00:57.388 --> 00:00:59.893
It makes your icon
a little bit smaller and

16
00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:02.980
clears out space around
each one of those symbols.

17
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.620
Make sense?

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:05.340
Okay.

19
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.717
Then what do I need to add here?

20
00:01:09.717 --> 00:01:13.137
Border radius.

21
00:01:13.137 --> 00:01:14.840
50 percent.

22
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.410
So, now we make a circle.

23
00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:20.570
Woo-hoo, yeah.

24
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.100
&gt;&gt; Sorry,
why did padding make the images smaller?

25
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.430
&gt;&gt; Because,
we're putting this on the icons.

26
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.500
Which is the div that is surrounding
the link that is surrounding the image.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.370
&gt;&gt; Would it do that to other kinds
of content, text or something?

28
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.302
&gt;&gt; Potentially,
if you gave it a width and a height.

29
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.610
Cuz, remember,
we're working with border box.

30
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.250
So, we said the width is 50 pixels and
we've added now 10 pixels of padding.

31
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.170
So, we've got to shrink
the size of our content.

32
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.477
That's what we have going on here, okay?

33
00:01:58.477 --> 00:02:03.635
Yeah, pretty cool, okay.

34
00:02:03.635 --> 00:02:11.404
So, and then the last part of this is
putting the icons on the image itself.

35
00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:15.020
So, back up here in the figure,
well actually, let me do it this way.

36
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.120
Thinking about how to do this,

37
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.820
because you guys have never worked
with absolute positioning before.

38
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.809
So, let's start it this way.

39
00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.386
I have my explanation here.

40
00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:26.986
All right, let's do it this way.

41
00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:31.600
Icons, colon first of type.

42
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:41.367
So, what we're doing here is I'm selecting
the first icon In my group of icons here.

43
00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.346
That's what that particular selector says.

44
00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:46.480
So, the very first icon,
whatever it happens to be,

45
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.790
that is the one we're going to choose.

46
00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.740
In absolute positioning,
we can say position of absolute.

47
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.780
That's how it starts.

48
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.575
If you notice the image
has now disappeared.

49
00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.322
[LAUGH] Did everybody see that?

50
00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:11.649
I take it away it was there.

51
00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.247
And when I put it back, it's gone.

52
00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:20.100
Very nice, okay?

53
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.720
And the reason it does that in this
case it's going the upper left-hand

54
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.190
corner of the screen.

55
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.166
So, we have to tell it to display
somewhere else you can do

56
00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:36.456
that with the properties that
are called top bottom right and

57
00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:41.452
left, and I am going to do
right five percent top 55%.

58
00:03:41.452 --> 00:03:46.367
And you will notice that now I
have an Instagram icon hanging

59
00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:50.410
out there in space,
having a great life, okay?

60
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.720
Probably not what we want.

61
00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.065
And this comes back to the question in
CSS, which is relative to what, okay?

62
00:04:01.065 --> 00:04:04.682
So, absolute positioning is going to
allow you to take any element and

63
00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:07.680
move it anywhere you want on the web page.

64
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.510
But, the question is relative to what?

65
00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.600
Its relative to its ancestor,
with a position other than static.

66
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.490
Aren't you glad you know that now?

67
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.100
A position other than static.

68
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.417
So, static positioning is what all
of these elements have by default,

69
00:04:24.417 --> 00:04:26.200
everything has a position of static.

70
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.968
So, what this is doing right now,

71
00:04:29.968 --> 00:04:34.580
this particular position is 5%
away from the edge of the page.

72
00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.783
And 50% down from the top.

73
00:04:36.783 --> 00:04:40.156
Because, it's gone all the way back
to the body element and it says,

74
00:04:40.156 --> 00:04:43.350
there is no other position
other than static on this page.

75
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.270
So, it's positioning relative to that
top left corner here in the body, right?

76
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.830
That's why it actually showed up here.

77
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.270
And if you look at it,
it kinda makes sense, right?

78
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.810
Looks like not too far from the right.

79
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.880
Well, more or
less in the middle, 55%, yeah?

80
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:05.844
So, in order to use absolute positioning
and have it apply to our figure.

81
00:05:05.844 --> 00:05:10.690
We need to add a position other
than static somewhere here.

82
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.230
And we can do that with our figure itself.

83
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.470
So here on my figure,
I will add to this a position of relative.

84
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.050
That is something other than static and

85
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.140
it doesn't do anything necessarily with
the way that this page is rendering.

86
00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.830
So, now my Instagram icon shows up
closer to where I want it to be.

87
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.930
It looks like I have probably something
off somewhere here in my code.

88
00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.468
But, that gets us closer.

89
00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:47.702
Questions on that so far?

90
00:05:53.231 --> 00:06:00.430
Okay, so here is the absolute
coolest part of all of this.

91
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.510
So, we have three icons.

92
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.430
And you could set these up with classes
and have them display on the page.

93
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.523
But remember, we have some
cases where we have two icons.

94
00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:17.370
And we have some wonder why that did that.

95
00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.150
We have some cases where we have one icon,
right?

96
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.090
And we want them all displayed
exactly in the right way.

97
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.386
So, how do we get this to work no
matter how many icons we have?

98
00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:33.210
Whether we one, two or three icons,

99
00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.779
and the way we can do this is
with these wacky CSS selectors.

100
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.240
So, this is more oriented to you,
more advanced developers.

101
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.980
And I'm gonna walk you through
exactly how you would set this up.

102
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:55.220
So, if we have icons nth of type of two.

103
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.995
This is gonna select the second icon And

104
00:07:01.995 --> 00:07:06.603
to that,
we can say our position is absolute.

105
00:07:06.603 --> 00:07:14.107
And our right position is -5% and

106
00:07:14.107 --> 00:07:18.117
our top is 41%.

107
00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:22.910
Okay, so there we go.

108
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.740
Now we've got two icons there.

109
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.151
So in other words, the second icon
is always gonna go to this spot.

110
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:34.040
And the first of type
will go underneath of it.

111
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.753
Notice how nicely that is working
all the way through here.

112
00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:46.570
And then, again, I'm not panicking until I
put in all of my code and then I'll panic.

113
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:52.530
The last one here, you CSS nerds
will really appreciate this one.

114
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.330
We actually have two types of styles
that we wanna account for here.

115
00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:00.861
If we have, the only icon.

116
00:08:00.861 --> 00:08:03.453
Or if we have the last icon,
in other words,

117
00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:07.180
the one in the third position
has to be in the same spot.

118
00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:12.240
And the way I'm going to do this is
with is which is a new selector.

119
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.968
So, if it is the last of type,

120
00:08:17.968 --> 00:08:20.950
only of type.

121
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.618
And here we'll say position of absolute.

122
00:08:26.618 --> 00:08:33.269
Right will be -8% and top will be 25%.

123
00:08:36.506 --> 00:08:38.249
Okay.

124
00:08:38.249 --> 00:08:44.707
So, if it's your last icon,
it's gonna show up here.

125
00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:47.240
Or actually here, the Instagram icon.

126
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:53.350
In the case where we only have two icons,
it's gonna show up there.

127
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.730
The first one will show up here.

128
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.520
Or, sorry,
the second one will show up here.

129
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.970
I still don't know what's
going on with this.

130
00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.890
I have to go back and look at that HTML.

131
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:07.740
I'm not sure why that icon is extra small,
but anyway, there we go.

132
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.840
And so, you can see how nicely
this works for all of these.

133
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.025
Whether you have one, two, or three icons.

134
00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:16.919
They are showing up
correctly on the images.

135
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.350
And the trick to this is to make sure that
these classes are in exactly this order.

136
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.830
If you put them in a different order,
it doesn't work.

137
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:28.088
So, you have to list the last one,
the middle one, and

138
00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:30.460
then the first one in order to
get this to work correctly.

139
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.430
Okay.

140
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:37.280
And then my very last trick is to
add a hover state for my icons.

141
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.400
So, icons colon hover.

142
00:09:40.567 --> 00:09:44.980
The background color will be var blue.

143
00:09:47.728 --> 00:09:51.120
So now, when I hover over those icons,
their background color changes.

144
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.738
Woo-hoo.

145
00:09:55.615 --> 00:10:02.570
Okay, now that I've completely blown
your minds, Any questions on that?

146
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:08.440
Just to say a little bit more
about those particular selectors.

147
00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.460
So, first of type and subtype,
last of type only of type.

148
00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.410
These are pseudo classes
that are available to us.

149
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:18.912
I go over them in
the intermediate HTML and

150
00:10:18.912 --> 00:10:22.170
CSS course where I talk
more about selectors.

151
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.410
And the same with the is, is, and has, and

152
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.000
where are three brand new
pseudoclasses that are out there.

153
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:36.130
One of those parameters has to be
true in order for the style to apply.

154
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.050
It's kind of a shorthand of
writing a bunch of other things.

155
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.475
So again, if you take a look at
the intermediate HTML and CSS course,

156
00:10:42.475 --> 00:10:47.130
it'll walk you through all these wacky
selectors that I've used here for this.

157
00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.259
Again, if you're more
of a junior developer,

158
00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:51.614
you might find it works
better just to have classes.

159
00:10:51.614 --> 00:10:54.322
And you can assign them one,
two and three, and

160
00:10:54.322 --> 00:10:57.250
assign the classes to
the icons as you wish, okay?

161
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:00.310
So, here we are.

162
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:02.947
They're all stacked on top of
each other here on the screen.

163
00:11:02.947 --> 00:11:05.290
And we have our icons in place.

164
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:06.100
I love this trick.

165
00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.110
It's totally awesome.

166
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.348
So, I'm glad you all enjoyed it too.
