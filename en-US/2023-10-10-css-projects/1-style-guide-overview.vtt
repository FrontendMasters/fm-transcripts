1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.360
All right, fantastic, so,
let's get started and make some code.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.040
So, let me show you the website,
this is the website.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.516
Once again, projects.css.education and

4
00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:19.824
we are going to start down here at
the bottom, there is a project listing.

5
00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:24.188
And we are going to start with project 1,
style guide, columns, and cover.

6
00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:25.424
Let me click on that link,

7
00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:28.190
this is our first challenge
that I'm gonna give you here.

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.439
So, if you click on the screenshot,
you can zoom in and so forth,

9
00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.620
I'm gonna leave mine like this.

10
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.750
So, let's talk about what you see here.

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.590
Anybody make any comment about what
you see here for the style guide?

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.655
Comments about what do you expect
the HTML is going to look like,

13
00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:51.942
comments about how what kind of styles you
think you might be putting in place here?

14
00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:56.559
Comments about things you don't
understand how to Jen manage to get

15
00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.180
that blank thing done.

16
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.910
&gt;&gt; There's like consistent color scheme.

17
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.814
&gt;&gt; There is absolutely a consistent color
scheme and where does that color scheme?

18
00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:08.068
&gt;&gt; It's a handful of the colors
that are spelled out in the boxes.

19
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.976
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
those boxes that are up there on the top,

20
00:01:10.976 --> 00:01:15.058
those are the colors that we're
going to be using for the website.

21
00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:18.087
Notice that we have like
a pop of blue there.

22
00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:22.501
Pop, great home and
garden television kind of word.

23
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.410
And we've got a lot of neutrals in there,
right?

24
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.649
So for those of you who are thinking about
color and how to put it on the page,

25
00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.777
those things like blue might wind up
being a call to action kind of thing.

26
00:01:32.777 --> 00:01:37.473
You really draw your eye as opposed
to the rest of the coffee colors that

27
00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:39.311
are Kind of beige, right?

28
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:42.910
Okay, Anna, do you have an observation?

29
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.163
&gt;&gt; You've got multiple aspects of
styling to your header column.

30
00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:52.630
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so are there any of those
there that you wonder about or?

31
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.501
&gt;&gt; I mean,
I glanced ahead at the take home portion.

32
00:01:57.501 --> 00:02:00.039
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So I know there's some fun stuff going

33
00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:05.520
on with that kind of I don't know what you
would call the effect on your style guide.

34
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.164
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the word under style guide.

35
00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:08.976
&gt;&gt; There's some fun stuff going on there.

36
00:02:08.976 --> 00:02:10.786
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's kind of awesome.

37
00:02:10.786 --> 00:02:12.570
We need to look into
how that's gonna work.

38
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.235
Jace, you got an observation?

39
00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:16.130
&gt;&gt; Well, she stole mine, so thank you.

40
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.515
&gt;&gt; Sorry.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

41
00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:18.680
&gt;&gt; Okay, fantastic.

42
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.383
&gt;&gt; I take it back.

43
00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:19.993
You can have it.

44
00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:21.212
&gt;&gt; No, can we partner on that one?

45
00:02:21.212 --> 00:02:21.727
&gt;&gt; Sure, yeah.

46
00:02:21.727 --> 00:02:22.334
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

47
00:02:22.334 --> 00:02:24.228
The style guide was
a really nice highlight.

48
00:02:24.228 --> 00:02:25.235
&gt;&gt; You like that?

49
00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:27.260
Okay, great, yeah.

50
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.781
Rox?

51
00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:33.223
&gt;&gt; I'm just gonna look at how you have
your colors on there, they're all like,

52
00:02:33.223 --> 00:02:37.928
same shape, same size,
like same distance, they're perfect.

53
00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:39.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, how did I do that magic?

54
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.130
That's a great question.

55
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.980
Wonderful thing to wonder about.

56
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.700
Ben, what you got?

57
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.216
&gt;&gt; For me, I hesitate to reveal
my ignorance perhaps but

58
00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:52.449
I've only ever seen a style guide
like this once before at work.

59
00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:56.399
So right away I love the layout I see what
we have is essentially a collection of all

60
00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:59.143
the different elements we could use,
we've headers.

61
00:02:59.143 --> 00:03:02.061
I assume these are buttons of
different colors here but maybe not,

62
00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:04.050
we've got our headings and our paragraphs.

63
00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.040
One thing, honestly the first
thing that jumps out at me,

64
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.560
because my brain hates it, is that there's
no margin on the headings specifically, so

65
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.776
the text lines up real
close with the edge.

66
00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:15.402
Which just bothers your eye,

67
00:03:15.402 --> 00:03:19.371
but then I realize, of course,
that's telling us there's no margin or

68
00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:23.093
spacing on the headings themselves,
which is of course by design.

69
00:03:23.093 --> 00:03:27.727
But to contrast the buttons themselves
clearly have some padding between them and

70
00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:30.292
stuff like that you see
text links have none.

71
00:03:30.292 --> 00:03:34.246
Our images obviously enormous which
looks like it's filling with equals 100.

72
00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:38.293
And there's just a little it's always
time for coffee down there that I see,

73
00:03:38.293 --> 00:03:40.358
I don't know what that's telling us.

74
00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:42.349
&gt;&gt; Okay, great.

75
00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.486
So that was a lot of observations
there that Ben had for us,

76
00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:47.947
he was a three on his CSS
&gt;&gt; No, that was a two.

77
00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:48.610
&gt;&gt; You're a two.

78
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.377
&gt;&gt; He's a two on his CSS scale here,

79
00:03:50.377 --> 00:03:54.356
so notice some of the things that he is
pointing out like the fact that we've

80
00:03:54.356 --> 00:03:57.657
jammed everything over the left
side.This is a style guide.

81
00:03:57.657 --> 00:04:01.268
This no one is actually going to see this
page, so this is not the kind of styling

82
00:04:01.268 --> 00:04:05.128
that we would I mean, we would never put
anything like this into production right?

83
00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:07.380
This is for us to set up our base styling.

84
00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.733
So the fact that it is jammed to the edge
of the page tells you there is no left or

85
00:04:12.733 --> 00:04:18.521
right, well, most likely, we assume on
the right, padding or margin, right?

86
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:19.024
Okay.

87
00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.824
Dinesh, do you have some observations for
us?

88
00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:22.526
&gt;&gt; The last one.

89
00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:27.446
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I mean, when I start to look into that,

90
00:04:27.446 --> 00:04:30.938
the style guide is,
they're already covered.

91
00:04:30.938 --> 00:04:35.389
But the space between the header and
then the tan color,

92
00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.660
the vanilla colors,
there is a three lines, right?

93
00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.076
I found very difficult to
get those three lines.

94
00:04:44.076 --> 00:04:45.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

95
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.082
So he's pointing to, those lines
that go between that top that's

96
00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:52.830
the coffee color and
the Manila color that comes underneath.

97
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.282
How did we get those magic lines in place,
okay?

98
00:04:56.282 --> 00:05:02.683
And spoiler it's a little easier
than you would think, okay?

99
00:05:02.683 --> 00:05:03.386
Yes, sorry Ben.

100
00:05:03.386 --> 00:05:08.001
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm also just curious if you got
these colors all on your own or if you use

101
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:12.869
this tool to establish your color palette
&gt;&gt; I love those tools that establish your

102
00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:13.979
color palette but

103
00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.876
in this particular case that graphic
designer put this together for us, yes.

104
00:05:18.876 --> 00:05:20.540
Now I did not the graphic designer.

105
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.446
We have Alex is a fantastic graphic
designer, he created these colors for us.

106
00:05:25.446 --> 00:05:27.664
Mark you you had a comment.

107
00:05:27.664 --> 00:05:31.250
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a couple comments and
questions from online.

108
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.974
&gt;&gt; Okay.

109
00:05:32.974 --> 00:05:37.520
&gt;&gt; Jackson says it's a simple style
guide that can be used to create

110
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.298
a beautiful interface.

111
00:05:39.298 --> 00:05:39.919
&gt;&gt; Okay.

112
00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:43.825
&gt;&gt; And then Frank said,
I guess I'm a one compared to that guy.

113
00:05:43.825 --> 00:05:47.998
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; He liked your explanation.

114
00:05:47.998 --> 00:05:49.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah, nice job, Ben.

115
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.294
&gt;&gt; And then Kamal online is asking if

116
00:05:54.294 --> 00:05:59.238
we'll see variables in the root.

117
00:05:59.238 --> 00:06:00.890
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Matching these color names then?

118
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.441
&gt;&gt; Yes, we will.

119
00:06:02.441 --> 00:06:07.596
&gt;&gt; And then, is there a dark theme?

120
00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.011
&gt;&gt; There is no dark theme in
these particular examples, but

121
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:12.140
that is absolutely something
that you could add.

122
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.819
So if we go back to our website now,
And if you scroll down you'll see here

123
00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:21.610
I've given you for the style guide,
I've given you some instructions.

124
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.650
So you can read through those instructions
on your own and work through those.

125
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.615
If you scroll down to the bottom here,
you'll see the big red button here that

126
00:06:31.615 --> 00:06:35.342
says beginning code pen, shockingly,
that is the beginning code pen.

127
00:06:35.342 --> 00:06:38.520
And if you take a look at
that beginning code pen.

128
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.770
You will see here that I have given
you the HTML, I want you to start

129
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.787
with semantic, HTML, and I want you to
write very generic styling here for

130
00:06:49.787 --> 00:06:54.589
our style guide because we will
use this later as our start.

131
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:59.750
We'll override these styles as we
work on the layout for the website.

132
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.646
So you'll see here I have a header,
I've got an H1 and

133
00:07:03.646 --> 00:07:08.671
I've put a span with a class of fancy
text around the word style guide.

134
00:07:08.671 --> 00:07:13.424
So spoiler somehow that word
underline has something to do with

135
00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:15.404
that class of fancy text.

136
00:07:15.404 --> 00:07:18.060
There's our color boxes, there they are.

137
00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.849
Here's our headings and
a paragraph, a link, okay?

138
00:07:21.849 --> 00:07:24.951
And then I've marked up a figure.

139
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:28.010
Anybody ever heard of the figure
element is one of my favourites.

140
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:35.426
This is an HTML element that is,
of course, combines your image there,

141
00:07:35.426 --> 00:07:41.035
which has an alt text to it
along with a caption, okay?

142
00:07:41.035 --> 00:07:44.140
And I'm gonna emphasise this since I'm
not a lot of you are familiar with it.

143
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.023
The alt text should describe this
picture as if you did not see

144
00:07:49.023 --> 00:07:54.597
the picture the caption might say
something completely different.

145
00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:59.527
So the example I like to use is if
I have a picture of a baby Robin

146
00:07:59.527 --> 00:08:01.380
a little bird, okay?

147
00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.188
The figure caption for it might say you
know a baby bird standing in the grass

148
00:08:06.188 --> 00:08:10.310
you know baby juvenile American
robins standing in the grass but

149
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.845
the alt text is gonna say
something along the lines of.

150
00:08:13.845 --> 00:08:18.228
Spotted black and white feathers, no
orange breast, that kind of thing that you

151
00:08:18.228 --> 00:08:21.780
would get if you were actually
looking at the image, make sense?

152
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:24.851
So that's a figure and
that's what that is there for.

153
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:29.674
And you can see here, we have quite
a mess going on, that is our picture.

154
00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:32.046
Whew, it's kind of big, all right?

155
00:08:32.046 --> 00:08:36.909
So in our CSS, I've given you as
variables all of our starting colors,

156
00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:41.689
there they are, I've given you the fonts,
they are all hooked up with

157
00:08:41.689 --> 00:08:46.413
Google fonts so you don't need to
worry about that, they will work.

158
00:08:46.413 --> 00:08:48.674
There's information here
about a font scale.

159
00:08:48.674 --> 00:08:52.395
I've talked about this in a few of my
Frontend Masters courses I'd like you to

160
00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:53.610
write a font scale here.

161
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.508
So if you've watched some
of my courses before,

162
00:08:56.508 --> 00:09:01.245
you should be able to write a font scale
with this, if not, I've given you a link

163
00:09:01.245 --> 00:09:04.947
to a code pen here where you can
take a look and figure that out.

164
00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:09.110
And then I've also given you a variable
called radius probably has to

165
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.922
do with border radius right?

166
00:09:10.922 --> 00:09:12.959
&gt;&gt; Is figure for SEO?

167
00:09:12.959 --> 00:09:17.054
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure about the impact on SEO,
but it's really good for

168
00:09:17.054 --> 00:09:21.844
accessibility purposes because it
combines the picture with what is said

169
00:09:21.844 --> 00:09:24.483
underneath and it treats them as a unit.

170
00:09:24.483 --> 00:09:30.086
Which isn't necessarily true if you have
an image tag and a paragraph underneath,

171
00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:34.020
who knows what the relationship
is between those, okay?

172
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:35.498
Sound good?

173
00:09:35.498 --> 00:09:38.757
Everybody all set, ready to start?

174
00:09:38.757 --> 00:09:39.355
Yeah.
