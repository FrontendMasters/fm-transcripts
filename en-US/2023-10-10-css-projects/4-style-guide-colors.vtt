1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.353
Then we've got our fancy text.

2
00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:09.300
And I'm going to show
you this article here.

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.946
So I gave you a link to this article
inside of the web page that talks to you

4
00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:17.130
about creating so-called
low highlight text.

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.450
And this is a way that you can, and I'm
just gonna scroll real fast on down here.

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.880
Different kinds of highlights
here you can put on your text.

7
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.437
So here's an example of
putting one up high,

8
00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:35.410
here's an example of putting one down low,
right?

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.879
So if you just copy
these values from here,

10
00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:51.153
And we gonna set up our fancy-text class,
and we paste in that,

11
00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:55.613
that'll get you that
pink background there.

12
00:00:55.613 --> 00:01:00.570
So what we have going on,
we have a generalized background,

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330
which is a gradient.

14
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.621
So this is a linear gradient,

15
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:06.888
there's a bunch of different kinds of
gradients that are possible in CSS.

16
00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:09.580
The linear gradient goes
from one side to the other.

17
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.757
In this case, it's going at a 120 degree
angle with some colors associated with it.

18
00:01:15.757 --> 00:01:20.157
We're not gonna repeat that background,
we can set the size of that background,

19
00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:23.690
and the position of that background
to line it up here on the page.

20
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.631
So the article is where we start from
in terms of getting that in place, and

21
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:33.190
then we can just make a few changes
to the colors and the values here.

22
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.250
So instead of 120 degrees,
I set this to 135 degrees.

23
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.990
Instead of the pink color that we have to
start with, you can call your variables.

24
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.778
So var(--mocha), and
that's gonna go from 0.

25
00:01:49.778 --> 00:01:52.361
See how it's changing already?

26
00:01:52.361 --> 00:02:01.605
And then var(--tan) to 100%.

27
00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:07.582
So see how that already is looking
a little bit better there, okay?

28
00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:08.949
We're going to leave it at no-repeat.

29
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.300
The size, you can play around with.

30
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.552
What I wanted to do was line up that
background with the E in guide.

31
00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:21.350
And I found that 35% was
a good place to put that.

32
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.209
[LAUGH] You, of course,
can make that narrower by making that

33
00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.514
second number smaller,
that will make it less tall.

34
00:02:30.514 --> 00:02:35.900
So if I said 3%,
then we just have a very thin line.

35
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.326
If I said 30%, we get a little bit of
gap there between the line and the E.

36
00:02:41.326 --> 00:02:42.531
See that?

37
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:47.174
Was kind of unsightly, so
we changed it to 35 to fill it in, okay?

38
00:02:47.174 --> 00:02:51.810
And the background position of 0 and
90% worked for me.

39
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.580
So that's how we put that in place.

40
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.923
And now,
we have a class of fancy-text that we

41
00:02:57.923 --> 00:03:02.749
can apply this anywhere we wanna
use it later on, super fun.

42
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.260
Okay, then the last part
is our color boxes.

43
00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.249
So we're gonna start with our .colors.

44
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.080
So we have a div with a class of colors,
and

45
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.420
then we have a bunch of
divs inside of this, right?

46
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.947
So we can say .colors,
and we could say div.

47
00:03:30.232 --> 00:03:34.700
So for all divs inside of a class of
colors, that would select everything.

48
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.363
You could also do, one of my favorite
selectors is, the greater than and a star.

49
00:03:41.363 --> 00:03:45.563
So this says, for
all of the immediate children of colors,

50
00:03:45.563 --> 00:03:50.351
no matter what they are,
whether they're divs or something else,

51
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.302
we wanna style them in the following way.

52
00:03:53.302 --> 00:03:58.255
And what we're gonna do is we're
gonna give it a width, 5rem,

53
00:03:58.255 --> 00:04:03.779
we're gonna give it a height,
4rem, and display, inline-block.

54
00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:08.170
Good, inline block puts
them all together in a row.

55
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.260
You don't have to work with Flexbox,
you don't have to work with grid.

56
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.160
We just pile them all up in a row
really super easy like that.

57
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.921
And then we can say text-align: center,

58
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:29.130
we can say padding: 1rem 0,
and a margin of 1rem.

59
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.060
So that gives us just boxes
that are there on the page.

60
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.579
You'll have to trust me that those are all
there, that we could say also border:

61
00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:44.358
1pixel solid, var(--coffee), and
you'll see that all the boxes are there.

62
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.259
Now, all we have to do is
assign them the colors.

63
00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.679
So .white is background-color

64
00:04:56.679 --> 00:05:00.552
of var(--white).

65
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.953
&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry, what was the nifty
little thing that didn't need flex?

66
00:05:10.953 --> 00:05:12.795
Excellent, no inline block, great.

67
00:05:12.795 --> 00:05:14.630
&gt;&gt; Inline block, display of inline block.

68
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.993
This is how we used to make vertical,
sorry,

69
00:05:16.993 --> 00:05:19.743
horizontal nav bars before
we had Flexbox and grid.

70
00:05:19.743 --> 00:05:24.850
We'd use inline block to put all of our
elements together there on a navbar.

71
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.425
So it's an oldie but a goodie.

72
00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:31.817
Still works great, especially for
something like this, it's really simple.

73
00:05:31.817 --> 00:05:33.716
&gt;&gt; It still do but we used to too?

74
00:05:33.716 --> 00:05:37.913
&gt;&gt; Yes, well, people tend to think we have
to have Flexbox or grid to do it now.

75
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.478
Okay, so now, we can set up
all of the rest of our colors,

76
00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:48.091
green with a background color of green.

77
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:54.489
And if our text doesn't show,
then we can add to that a color of var,

78
00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:59.115
whatever, vanilla, or white, or something.

79
00:05:59.115 --> 00:06:00.233
Here we go.

80
00:06:00.233 --> 00:06:03.726
And then we can copy-paste,
so the next one's coffee.

81
00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:09.975
Background-color is coffee.

82
00:06:09.975 --> 00:06:14.289
And the next one is vanilla,
which is kind of already all set.

83
00:06:18.817 --> 00:06:23.870
In fact, I'm gonna leave it there,
because this is the same thing over and

84
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.978
over again to fill in the colors for
all the rest of the boxes, okay?

85
00:06:28.978 --> 00:06:31.573
Yes.
&gt;&gt; So the greater than sign specifically

86
00:06:31.573 --> 00:06:35.190
changed it from all descendants
to all immediate children?

87
00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.780
&gt;&gt; All immediate children, yes.

88
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.211
So the greater than sign,

89
00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:44.524
it's an indicator of
the parent-child relationship.

90
00:06:44.524 --> 00:06:47.960
It has no impact on specificity or
on the cascade.

91
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.244
It's indicating the relationship
between the two elements.

92
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:54.010
In this case, between colors and
all of its children.

93
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.456
So we're saying, for
all of those, do these things.

94
00:06:57.456 --> 00:06:58.797
Questions on our style guide?

95
00:06:58.797 --> 00:07:00.210
Yes.

96
00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.022
&gt;&gt; Looking at the screenshot, it seemed
like the vanilla box was the only one that

97
00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:07.340
ended up with a border,
cuz it's the same color as the background.

98
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.334
&gt;&gt; Right.

99
00:07:08.334 --> 00:07:12.701
&gt;&gt; It also seems to be changing the size
of that box by adding a border to it.

100
00:07:12.701 --> 00:07:16.281
&gt;&gt; It shouldn't, it shouldn't.

101
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:18.797
If you have up here, I didn't talk about.

102
00:07:18.797 --> 00:07:22.815
But if you have border-box
sizing applied to the page,

103
00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:26.235
which is this little bit of code here,
okay, so

104
00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:30.529
what we say is the box-sizing
is set to quote border-box.

105
00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:32.113
I'll explain what that is in a moment.

106
00:07:32.113 --> 00:07:35.346
And then we tell everything in
the universe plus everything before it and

107
00:07:35.346 --> 00:07:37.790
after it,
we're going to inherit that box-sizing.

108
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:42.541
Because once again, of course,
box-sizing is a box model property,

109
00:07:42.541 --> 00:07:46.199
it doesn't inherit, so
we have to tell it to inherit.

110
00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.110
What is a border-box?

111
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.378
Anybody have any idea
what a border-box is?

112
00:07:52.116 --> 00:07:56.429
&gt;&gt; Is it the border, the window,
the screen that the user is seeing?

113
00:07:56.429 --> 00:08:00.539
&gt;&gt; Kind of sort of, so
this has to do with how we

114
00:08:00.539 --> 00:08:04.440
calculate widths inside of CSS, okay?

115
00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:13.004
So by default, your width is just the
width of the content itself, that is all.

116
00:08:13.004 --> 00:08:16.788
So if you say width is 400 pixels,

117
00:08:16.788 --> 00:08:21.190
that is the width of the content, period.

118
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:26.125
If you then add to it,
let's say, 50 pixels of padding,

119
00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:30.196
that's gonna put 50
pixels on all four sides.

120
00:08:30.196 --> 00:08:33.145
What is the effective
width of that item now?

121
00:08:33.145 --> 00:08:34.626
&gt;&gt; It's 100 pixels, 500.

122
00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:36.399
&gt;&gt; 500 pixels, right?

123
00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:39.904
And if we add 50 pixels of
margin on all four sides,

124
00:08:39.904 --> 00:08:42.305
what is its width now effectively?

125
00:08:42.305 --> 00:08:43.410
&gt;&gt; 600.
&gt;&gt; 600 pixels,

126
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.274
because we add to the actual width
property, which is the content.

127
00:08:47.274 --> 00:08:52.830
We add to it the padding, the border,
and the margin, all of that.

128
00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:58.710
Border-box says, ignore the width of the
padding, ignore the width of the border.

129
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:04.476
When I say the width is 400 pixels,
and I have 50 pixels of padding and

130
00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:10.591
1 pixel of border, the whole thing
when I'm done is 400 pixels wide.

131
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:12.570
Makes math so much easier.

132
00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.293
So the only thing we have to
worry about is the margin.

133
00:09:17.835 --> 00:09:21.800
So I think you'll find most people
are putting this in by default these days.

134
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:24.252
That's what that little
bit of code is for.
