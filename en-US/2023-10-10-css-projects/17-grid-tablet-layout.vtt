00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.820
All right, so our next one, then,
is our tablet version of this page.

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.950
And in the tablet version,
now we're going to have these images.

3
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.690
Pay attention to where they
were in the mobile design.

4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.740
The macchiato's up here at the top,
the croissants down here at the bottom.

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.380
And now the macchiato is at the bottom,
and the croissant's in the middle.

6
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.217
So we've got things going all
over the place, different orders.

7
00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:33.350
And somehow we need to lay this
out in a grid kind of pattern.

8
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.890
So what are some of the implications here?

9
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.546
Somehow I'm gonna have to
grab specific images and

10
00:00:41.546 --> 00:00:43.530
put them in specific places, right?

11
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.131
So maybe we need a few more classes,
maybe.

12
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:54.176
And we're gonna have to think about
some kind of way of laying this out,

13
00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:55.953
maybe with grid, yeah?

14
00:00:55.953 --> 00:00:59.519
Okay, so going ahead and give this a try.

15
00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:09.889
All right, so in order to address this
next problem with our tablet size,

16
00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.447
let me make my screen a little bit bigger,
and

17
00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:17.270
this is going to be at around 675 pixels.

18
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.600
What did we need to do
in terms of our grid?

19
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.170
Anybody have any ideas?

20
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.090
What do we need to do
in terms of our grid?

21
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.600
&gt;&gt; So I said, I changed the wrapper.

22
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.600
All I did was changed
grid-template-columns to 1fr 1fr.

23
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.693
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh, perfect.

24
00:01:38.323 --> 00:01:41.931
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and then the rest of my
changes were on each individual image.

25
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:45.065
&gt;&gt; And then on each individual image,
assign it to a different spot, right?

26
00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:47.237
Yeah, that's pretty much the answer here.

27
00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:50.985
So, what we've done in the HTML is
we've assigned a second class to all

28
00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:52.243
of the image wrappers.

29
00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:55.639
And cuz I'm super creative,
I called them one through five.

30
00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:01.700
[LAUGH] You might have different names for
them, but that's pretty handy.

31
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.950
So what we wanna do then is,
we wanna turn on grid.

32
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.567
So, wrapper, we're going to display: grid.

33
00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:17.526
And then our grid-template-columns
will be 1fr 1fr.

34
00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:19.747
So immediately it'll go to this,

35
00:02:19.747 --> 00:02:23.506
which is actually kind of
a nice design by itself, right?

36
00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:27.097
Yeah, pretty good,
if you like that, you can keep it.

37
00:02:27.097 --> 00:02:29.678
That if you wanna continue
on with my crazy thing.

38
00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:32.489
Then I will also would add a gap of 1rem,

39
00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.460
which will give us a little bit of
space between all those images.

40
00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.540
Perhaps you are done,
that might be all you need to do.

41
00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.990
But if you wanted to continue on,
you might do something like this.

42
00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.888
So, here for my h1,
we need to assign it to a specific spot,

43
00:02:48.888 --> 00:02:53.410
so we're gonna use our grid columns and
our grid rows.

44
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.999
So grid-column, what are our numbers here?

45
00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:06.302
We want it to go-
&gt;&gt; Each one, that'll be 1/3.

46
00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:11.146
&gt;&gt; 1/3, exactly, 1/3, and

47
00:03:11.146 --> 00:03:14.263
our grid row is what?

48
00:03:14.263 --> 00:03:16.456
&gt;&gt; 1/2.

49
00:03:16.456 --> 00:03:25.082
&gt;&gt; 1/2, very good, the other thing I did
was I said my font size will be var(--lg).

50
00:03:25.082 --> 00:03:27.912
Let's just make it bigger because we can.

51
00:03:27.912 --> 00:03:32.020
Okay, done, for .one,

52
00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:41.270
Let's say border: 5px solid red,

53
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.300
or yeah, red's good,

54
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.510
yellow, here we go.

55
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.010
That one is one, [LAUGH] okay?

56
00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.410
Where is that one going
to go in our design?

57
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.360
&gt;&gt; Bottom left.

58
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.300
&gt;&gt; This is gonna go in the bottom left.

59
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.660
So what are our columns and
what are our rows?

60
00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.219
&gt;&gt; Column, 1/2.

61
00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.546
&gt;&gt; 1/2, and our rows is gonna be what?

62
00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:09.291
&gt;&gt; 5/6.

63
00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:13.472
&gt;&gt; 5/6, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4.

64
00:04:13.472 --> 00:04:14.251
&gt;&gt; It's 4/5.

65
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:17.188
&gt;&gt; 4/5, yeah, okay?

66
00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:26.787
So we've got grid-column: 1/2, and

67
00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:33.455
grid-row: 4/5, cool.

68
00:04:44.429 --> 00:04:50.635
Okay, two, two is the coffee cup here,
where is the coffee cup gonna go?

69
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:56.993
Right on up here, so
what is that in terms of columns and rows?

70
00:04:56.993 --> 00:04:58.433
Grid columns is gonna be?

71
00:04:58.433 --> 00:04:59.034
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

72
00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:00.022
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

73
00:05:00.022 --> 00:05:02.037
&gt;&gt; 2/3, the rows is gonna be?

74
00:05:02.037 --> 00:05:03.073
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

75
00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:08.460
&gt;&gt; 2/3, very good, okay, so

76
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.690
2/3, 2/3., okay, sweet.

77
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.370
And if you notice, the ice coffee went
exactly where it's supposed to go, so

78
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.260
we don't even have to call out a place for
that.

79
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.859
The next thing we should do is
try to move this green tea,

80
00:05:29.859 --> 00:05:34.125
I guess, down to, next to the macchiato,

81
00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:37.976
so, Let's copy that.

82
00:05:44.292 --> 00:05:46.346
I'm gonna guess this is number four.

83
00:05:53.688 --> 00:05:57.826
Okay, so it's number four,
so where is that one going?

84
00:05:57.826 --> 00:05:59.100
Grid column what?

85
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.092
&gt;&gt; That's 2/3.

86
00:06:01.092 --> 00:06:02.029
&gt;&gt; 2/3.

87
00:06:04.643 --> 00:06:06.200
Do I really have that many borders?

88
00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.378
I do, I'm sorry, I'm confusing you now,
let me get rid of those borders.

89
00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:18.591
Okay, so 2/3, and our grid row for
that one would be?

90
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:22.047
&gt;&gt; Is that 3/4, yeah.

91
00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:22.925
&gt;&gt; 3/4?

92
00:06:27.622 --> 00:06:28.604
&gt;&gt; 4/5.

93
00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:32.035
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; 4/5, okay, so

94
00:06:32.035 --> 00:06:37.284
then all that's left is the croissant,
which is image number five, right?

95
00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:45.680
We know that cuz it was the last one,
and, let me get rid of that ugly border.

96
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.654
And for image number five,
what have we got?

97
00:06:48.654 --> 00:06:50.319
&gt;&gt; grid-column: 1/3.

98
00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.990
&gt;&gt; 1/3 for our grid-column.

99
00:06:56.097 --> 00:06:57.833
And our grid-row would be?

100
00:06:57.833 --> 00:06:59.695
&gt;&gt; 3/4
&gt;&gt; 3/4.

101
00:06:59.695 --> 00:07:01.787
&gt;&gt; 3/4.

102
00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:04.885
&gt;&gt; I can't tell, are they all
supposed to be the same height, or

103
00:07:04.885 --> 00:07:07.158
is that croissant's supposed to be taller?

104
00:07:07.158 --> 00:07:12.432
&gt;&gt; I think we made these a little
bit bigger this time around.

105
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:16.333
I have here that the height for

106
00:07:16.333 --> 00:07:20.089
five will be 400 pixels.

107
00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:26.287
Okay, so we can set one of them higher.

108
00:07:26.287 --> 00:07:32.110
And if you want to also set the image
wrapper, put it before, img-wrapper.

109
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.390
And the height will be 300 pixels.

110
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:42.129
Now, the reason we wanna put this before
is that these are both just one class, so

111
00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:44.231
they have the same weight, right?

112
00:07:44.231 --> 00:07:49.148
So for our middle croissant image here,
we set the height to 300 pixels, right,

113
00:07:49.148 --> 00:07:52.486
because it's got both a class
of img-wrapper and five.

114
00:07:52.486 --> 00:07:56.292
And then five, we have a height of 400
pixels, so that one takes priority,

115
00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:59.650
right, overrides it,
cuz it comes later in the code.

116
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.904
If we swap the order of these,

117
00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:10.340
Now they're all the same height,
the order matters, right?

118
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.332
The order is part of the big C,
the cascade.

119
00:08:13.332 --> 00:08:18.160
So by putting that image wrapper later,
see how that changes?

120
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.898
Yes?

121
00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:24.080
&gt;&gt; Can I see where you declared the rows,
again, for the grid?

122
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, up here in the wrapper,
I actually never declared any rows.

123
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:34.301
We just declared columns, so
grid makes rows automatically for you.

124
00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:36.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can declare them.

125
00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:44.390
We can say grid-template-rows
of repeat (3, auto).

126
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:48.514
And now we've been very clear with grid,
we wanna have three rows,

127
00:08:48.514 --> 00:08:50.050
and they show up here on the page.

128
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:54.010
But since grid tries to guess what
you wanna do, [LAUGH] so to speak,

129
00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.910
it will create those rows for
you even if you don't call them out.

130
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:03.654
&gt;&gt; So effectively,
it's already doing 3, auto?

131
00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:08.638
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's doing that for you,
yeah, great question, okay?

132
00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:09.950
So there we go.
