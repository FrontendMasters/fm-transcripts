1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.190
We are moving on to our tablet.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.225
So this is going to have a 600
pixel minimum dimension,

3
00:00:07.225 --> 00:00:12.090
not terribly different
from what we had before.

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.719
So we still have our coffee here on the
side, but now we're gonna have the image

5
00:00:17.719 --> 00:00:23.374
by itself and we're gonna put the text and
the button over here on the outside.

6
00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:31.308
So give that a shot and see if you
can make that next tablet layout and

7
00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:36.422
that will be for 600 pixels and larger.

8
00:00:41.464 --> 00:00:46.750
Great, so I hope that,
that layout process worked okay for you.

9
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.052
We're building on the grid layout
that we had from before and

10
00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:53.690
we're continuing to work that and
expand it a little bit further.

11
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.760
So let's go through exactly how
that is gonna wind up shaking out.

12
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.855
So here we are at a minimum
width of 600 pixels,

13
00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:04.849
hold, let me make sure I'm at
a minimum width of 600 pixels.

14
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.171
And then we can start adding some styling,
so

15
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.902
one of the things that we do
is we make our fancy text

16
00:01:14.902 --> 00:01:19.311
a little bit bigger, font-size of var-xl.

17
00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:28.048
Okay, now we're back into
our card layouts again, so

18
00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:33.478
we're gonna continue to have our cards
all stacked on top of each other.

19
00:01:33.478 --> 00:01:39.275
But now we need to move that button and
the text over to the right of the image,

20
00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:43.006
so let's go through how
we're going to do that.

21
00:01:43.006 --> 00:01:48.886
So .card again,
we've still got this displayed as grid,

22
00:01:48.886 --> 00:01:54.179
now we're going to change
around our columns again,

23
00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.894
so grid, template, columns,
40 pixels, 1fr, 0.75fr.

24
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.290
Extensive testing showed that this
was the right dimensions to use.

25
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.615
And then for our grid template rows,

26
00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:17.715
we are going to do a repeat 2,

27
00:02:17.715 --> 00:02:24.000
Min, Max of 25%, 50%.

28
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.790
So, we want to rows and we want those
rows to be between 25% of the height and

29
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.020
50% of the height, we do not want
these to get extensively large.

30
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.768
So that's where we're putting
a little bit of a clamp so

31
00:02:40.768 --> 00:02:43.249
to speak on these particular items.

32
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.399
And then a gap of one rem, so we'll have
a little bit of space in between our

33
00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:52.470
elements here inside of our card.

34
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.743
Now we can go through and

35
00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:58.010
rearrange all of the elements
that are here inside of our card.

36
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.128
Our h2 is more or less in the right place,
but because we have changed

37
00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:06.580
the structure of our card,
I'm going to do this just for security.

38
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.707
And make sure we have it in the right
place, our grid row will be 1/3,

39
00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:18.080
so it's gonna go from the first row down
to the two rows, it's gonna span that.

40
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.545
And it is gonna appear, of course,

41
00:03:21.545 --> 00:03:25.710
grid column in the first column, 1/2.

42
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.089
For the image, .card-image,

43
00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:36.234
we're gonna have its grid
row be 1/3 because again

44
00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:42.419
we want the image to span both of
the rows that we've specified.

45
00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:48.198
So there it's doing that, and we want
this to appear in the second column,

46
00:03:48.198 --> 00:03:52.430
so grid-column will be 2/3,
so there it is there.

47
00:03:56.998 --> 00:03:59.727
For our card image, image,

48
00:03:59.727 --> 00:04:04.732
we're gonna set a minimum
height of 500 pixels,

49
00:04:04.732 --> 00:04:08.609
so it'd be at least 500 pixels tall.

50
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:15.157
We don't need it to stretch
much further than that.

51
00:04:15.157 --> 00:04:19.157
For our card P,
we want our grid row to be 1/2, so

52
00:04:19.157 --> 00:04:23.161
it's gonna appear in the second row,
there it is,

53
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:30.000
there's our paragraph right on top of
the image, right on top with the button.

54
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.693
Right there in that first row, remember
that paragraph from our previous media

55
00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:38.410
query has a vanilla background,
so there it is.

56
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.097
And we're gonna say now,
of course, grid-column, 3,

57
00:04:43.097 --> 00:04:46.299
4, which will move it over to the side.

58
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.927
And we'd probably want that text
to align to the top of the image,

59
00:04:52.927 --> 00:04:57.720
so padding-top will be zero, and that
will move it up to the top of the image.

60
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.460
Notice that the button for
order now also moved, why is that?

61
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.873
Remember the button is inside
of a paragraph as well, so,

62
00:05:05.873 --> 00:05:09.932
the style applies to both of those
elements and it moved up to the top.

63
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:18.730
Okay, for our card of the last of type,
card p last of type,

64
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:23.500
this is the one that contains the button.

65
00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.498
We can now say grid column 3/4 so
we'll move over to that

66
00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:32.585
side very happily on top
of its paragraph here.

67
00:05:32.585 --> 00:05:38.627
But we want it to be underneath of that so
grid-row will be 2/3 and

68
00:05:38.627 --> 00:05:43.400
that'll move it down
underneath of that paragraph.

69
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.134
Then we just need to style up the button
to make it look the way we want it at this

70
00:05:49.134 --> 00:05:50.090
breakpoint.

71
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.800
So we're bringing back some of the styles
that we had earlier for our button.

72
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.761
The background color is transparent,

73
00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:07.339
the color is var, coffee.

74
00:06:09.392 --> 00:06:13.656
The border is two pixels solid var coffee.

75
00:06:19.304 --> 00:06:25.280
And margin-top will be to rim which
will push it down a little bit here

76
00:06:31.252 --> 00:06:32.192
Okay.

77
00:06:34.284 --> 00:06:38.659
And then .button:hover,

78
00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:44.863
our background-color will be coffee.

79
00:06:48.794 --> 00:06:52.002
Our color will be var vanilla,

80
00:06:56.834 --> 00:07:00.611
And our border color will be var coffee.

81
00:07:04.764 --> 00:07:07.489
So we should wind up with that working.

82
00:07:07.489 --> 00:07:11.764
Now, this is not moving down
the way I wanted it to, so

83
00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.816
I probably missed something in here.

84
00:07:18.109 --> 00:07:22.401
Okay, well we'll just do that,
I made my column a little bit wider,

85
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:25.737
that gave me a little bit
more space there for my rows.

86
00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:30.130
And now I've got my order now button
showing up correctly underneath all

87
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:32.190
of my Various text here.

88
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.448
So you'll want to check all of those and

89
00:07:34.448 --> 00:07:37.750
make sure that you don't
have overlap with those.

90
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.607
And if you do,

91
00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:44.030
there's some other things you can do
with grid to make that work correctly.

92
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.907
So, now we've got three kinds
of cards in one layout.

93
00:07:48.907 --> 00:07:51.080
Are we ready for the fourth one, [LAUGH]?
