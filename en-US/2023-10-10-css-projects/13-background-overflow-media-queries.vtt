00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.310
So that was really, the very, very hard
part here, getting this working on mobile.

2
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.555
So the next one that we need
to work on is, basically,

3
00:00:10.555 --> 00:00:14.869
somehow we have to turn
off that scroll bar,

4
00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:21.767
then we have to rearrange how these
are presented on the page, right?

5
00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:28.545
You have to display our paragraph,
Right, that first item,

6
00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:34.907
we need to have a picture on one side and
some text on the other.

7
00:00:34.907 --> 00:00:39.807
And then we need to have the headlines and
numbers underneath.

8
00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:43.965
That's a lot, okay, cool, and then I'll
go through the answer here with you.

9
00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.241
Okay, so now,
we have these larger breakpoints, and

10
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:58.230
these take a little bit more
massaging to take a look at these.

11
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.800
So remember,
we have our outside card, right?

12
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.873
The wrapper with the card children,
that's one layout, and

13
00:01:10.873 --> 00:01:14.920
then we have the layout of
the cards themselves, okay?

14
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.233
So here we have four cards that have just
two components, they have a number and

15
00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:24.513
they have a headline,
everything else is out of the question.

16
00:01:24.513 --> 00:01:29.345
And our very first card has the number,
the headline, a paragraph,

17
00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:30.856
and an image, okay?

18
00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.417
And somehow that has to go
all the way across the page.

19
00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:37.447
So let's start by laying
out our first card,

20
00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:42.560
just that,
then let's lay out the rest of our cards.

21
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.380
And then let's lay out the cards on the
page to get the pattern that we have here.

22
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.308
So some of this is often working in
CSS is thinking about how to break

23
00:01:53.308 --> 00:01:58.324
this down from one giant layout
problem into these smaller chunks,

24
00:01:58.324 --> 00:02:00.680
and this is a good way to do it.

25
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.551
So we start with one card, get it to work
the way we want, add the other cards, and

26
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:08.490
then lay out everything all together.

27
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.810
Okay, so, what we're going to do here,
we're at 800 pixels.

28
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.452
So now, what I'm going to do is,
remember my card?

29
00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:29.124
Layout, right now,
we have our grid-template-columns:

30
00:02:29.124 --> 00:02:33.380
30px with a (250px, px).

31
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.269
So two columns, that is going to continue
to work for us here on this tablet for

32
00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.670
these items that are down
here on the bottom, right?

33
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.783
That continues to be true for these,

34
00:02:43.783 --> 00:02:48.086
it's this one up here on the top that
winds up being a little bit different.

35
00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:57.270
So, All right,

36
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.119
so let's start down here then.

37
00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:06.293
So first of all, card image, I'm gonna

38
00:03:06.293 --> 00:03:11.470
hide all the images on all the cards, and

39
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.424
make sure I'm at 800 pixels, there we go.

40
00:03:24.133 --> 00:03:28.124
The other thing I'm going to need to do is
I'm gonna need to differentiate this first

41
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.065
card from the others, so
I'm gonna give this a second class.

42
00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:36.845
If you don't know, you can have as many
classes as you want on a given element,

43
00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:41.366
you just separate them by spaces, so
class equals in quotes only one time, and

44
00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:44.265
then as many classes as
you want after that.

45
00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:48.805
And I'm gonna call this one 1, because
it happens to be the first card, so

46
00:03:48.805 --> 00:03:50.908
I can make exceptions to the rule.

47
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.478
Okay, so
then I'm gonna have my card called 1, and

48
00:04:08.478 --> 00:04:14.040
I am going to set this a little bit
differently than the rest of mine.

49
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:23.980
I'm gonna have grid-template-columns:
30 pixels 1fr 1fr;, okay?

50
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.388
And I'm going to have
grid-template-rows: 3rem 1fr.

51
00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:45.482
And let's also bring back one's paragraph,
we have a paragraph of information.

52
00:04:45.482 --> 00:04:49.581
So .one p {, we can say for

53
00:04:49.581 --> 00:04:54.753
this one grid-column: 1/3,

54
00:04:54.753 --> 00:05:01.565
it's gonna go across a couple of columns.

55
00:05:01.565 --> 00:05:07.014
We can say display block, which will
turn it back on again, so we can see it.

56
00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.109
And .one image { display: inline-block;,

57
00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:21.410
so we turned off all of
our images earlier, right?

58
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.580
But now, we've turned on the image
just for that first card right here.

59
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.155
Now, we need to place that image,

60
00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:40.922
so .one .card-image { grid-row:

61
00:05:40.922 --> 00:05:45.853
1/3; grid-column:.

62
00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:55.866
We have 3/4 and a max-height: 350px,

63
00:05:55.866 --> 00:06:00.519
I think the image has gotten lost here,

64
00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:06.450
because I don't have
the rest of the layout done.

65
00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.108
So let me go back, and I'm trying to make
this simpler for you and working on one

66
00:06:11.108 --> 00:06:15.570
layout at a time, but unfortunately
this isn't quite working that well.

67
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.711
So let's go back and get the cards
generally in place with the wrapper.

68
00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:28.157
Okay, so for the .wrapper

69
00:06:28.157 --> 00:06:33.428
{ grid-template-columns:

70
00:06:33.428 --> 00:06:39.050
repeat(2, 1fr);, okay?

71
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.953
So that gives us two big columns for

72
00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:47.503
the rest of our cards here

73
00:06:47.503 --> 00:06:54.620
grid-template-rows: repeat(3, auto).

74
00:06:57.856 --> 00:07:02.864
Okay, align-items: start;,

75
00:07:02.864 --> 00:07:06.372
this is going to push
everything up to the top, so

76
00:07:06.372 --> 00:07:10.995
that pushes up our little highlight
there up to the top of our grid

77
00:07:10.995 --> 00:07:16.120
cells rather than being aligned
in the center of our grid cells.

78
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.065
So it pushes the columns to the top of
the page, notice that our we go one,

79
00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:26.373
two, three, four, five,
going across the page.

80
00:07:26.373 --> 00:07:31.700
Whereas in our layout here,
our numbers go down the page one,

81
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.380
two, three down the page, all right?

82
00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:43.515
So cool little trick to make that
change is the grid-auto-flow: column;,

83
00:07:43.515 --> 00:07:48.692
and that will put the numbers
going down the page,

84
00:07:48.692 --> 00:07:54.622
it changes the order of this and
we can have a gap: 2rem.

85
00:07:57.312 --> 00:08:02.710
Okay, still not quite what
we want there for one, yeah?

86
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.310
What's going on there for item number one?

87
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:11.855
What is the problem that we have?

88
00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:14.620
&gt;&gt; One itself needs to span all
the columns of the wrapper.

89
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:20.164
&gt;&gt; Exactly, one itself needs to go
all the way across the wrapper,

90
00:08:20.164 --> 00:08:23.873
yeah, so
when we could go back here to one.

91
00:08:23.873 --> 00:08:30.530
This is, The layout in the card,

92
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.198
right, is those two things, and

93
00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:40.035
then we also have placement within

94
00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:45.980
.wrapper, where .one is a child.

95
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.591
So notice that you can be
simultaneously a child and a parent,

96
00:08:49.591 --> 00:08:54.050
just like in real life,
you can be both a child and a parent.

97
00:08:54.050 --> 00:09:00.062
So you may wind up with
an interesting mix of things here,

98
00:09:00.062 --> 00:09:04.961
grid-column: 1/3 grid-row: 1/2.

99
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.858
Okay, well, we mostly have it there,

100
00:09:09.858 --> 00:09:15.100
the only thing that we have left to do
now is deal with that number, right?

101
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.439
It's a weird thing going on with number,
and so,

102
00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:26.588
I have .number and .one, .number {,

103
00:09:31.131 --> 00:09:35.750
Background-position:, again,

104
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:40.667
just experimenting, 0% 2rem; and

105
00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:45.885
background-size: 100% 1rem;.

106
00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:55.506
And I think that's pretty close to done, I
think I've got all the styles, all right,

107
00:09:55.506 --> 00:09:56.560
so what do you think?

108
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.921
Even if you don't follow all
the things that I've typed in,

109
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:05.376
you see the logic here that we're
following in terms of laying this out?

110
00:10:05.376 --> 00:10:09.375
And the key takeaway here from this
particular exercise is that we have

111
00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:13.328
layouts within cards and we have
layout overall for all of the cards.

112
00:10:13.328 --> 00:10:17.254
And those are two separate problems that
we're kind of working at the same time,

113
00:10:17.254 --> 00:10:17.900
make sense?
