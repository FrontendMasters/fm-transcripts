1
00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:00.995
Fantastic.

2
00:00:00.995 --> 00:00:02.643
We've talked about the layout.

3
00:00:02.643 --> 00:00:04.857
We've done our semantic HTML.

4
00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:08.149
What is the next thing we need to do?

5
00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:08.860
&gt;&gt; Mobile.

6
00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.833
&gt;&gt; We need to do our mobile layouts, yay.

7
00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:16.378
So let us start on that.

8
00:00:16.378 --> 00:00:19.369
And to refresh your memory.

9
00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.714
Our mobile layouts is going
to have each of these people.

10
00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:27.776
They're just going to be stacked
on top of each other, okay?

11
00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.711
And you're going to have the icons
on the edges of the image.

12
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:37.419
Now, if you are new to the concept of
position, in this case, position absolute.

13
00:00:37.419 --> 00:00:41.809
What I would like to see you do in this
step is, you can do the following.

14
00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.444
You can make your image round,
make your image round.

15
00:00:46.444 --> 00:00:50.531
Set up the styling for the person's name.

16
00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:55.006
We're gonna have to steal fancy text,
we're gonna need to change a few

17
00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:59.048
of the variables there to make it
a thin line instead of a fat one.

18
00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:02.084
Make sure your icons are about that size,

19
00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:05.820
give them a green background and
make them around.

20
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.236
If you can't get the icons on to
the image, don't worry about it.

21
00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.698
But if you can do at least that.

22
00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:16.304
So you have Michelle, Owner, and you
have three icons right here underneath.

23
00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:19.292
That would be a great place to
be when you finish the step.

24
00:01:19.292 --> 00:01:22.780
And then, I'll talk you through how you're
gonna move those up onto the image,

25
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.303
all right?

26
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:29.066
All right, so

27
00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:35.004
hopefully you were able to get at
least partway through the design here.

28
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:39.864
So let's go through some of the more
straightforward aspects of this

29
00:01:39.864 --> 00:01:41.051
styling first.

30
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:46.155
So I'm gonna start with my
regular old figure here And

31
00:01:46.155 --> 00:01:50.655
in my regular old figure here,
I am going to start by

32
00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:55.485
giving this a little bit of
margin around each figure.

33
00:01:55.485 --> 00:02:02.034
So margin is going to be 0 auto 3rem auto.

34
00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:05.722
So that will center this,
the figure on the screen, and

35
00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:10.444
it will give us a little bit of extra
space down here towards the bottom.

36
00:02:10.444 --> 00:02:14.369
No judgment on how things are looking yet
because we got a lot going on here.

37
00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.260
[LAUGH] We have a lot of things to fix.

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.532
In addition to this,
we're gonna set our padding to zero.

39
00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:26.578
And I'm gonna set a max-width of 300 px.

40
00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:28.262
Now, why am I doing that?

41
00:02:28.262 --> 00:02:33.621
Well, when we get to putting
the actual icons on top of the image,

42
00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:38.988
we're going to need to do some
pretty precise positioning here.

43
00:02:38.988 --> 00:02:43.710
And it will wind up being that these are
not gonna be responsive the way we've made

44
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.317
other things responsive.

45
00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:50.024
Because trying to track where the icons
are going, in addition to the image and

46
00:02:50.024 --> 00:02:54.528
how things are expanding and
contracting, gets really, really tricky.

47
00:02:54.528 --> 00:02:56.468
So we're gonna do it this way instead.

48
00:02:56.468 --> 00:03:01.485
[COUGH]
Then, I can say figure

49
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:07.538
image is going to have
a border-radius of 50%.

50
00:03:07.538 --> 00:03:12.343
That makes our image circle, and

51
00:03:12.343 --> 00:03:20.243
I can give it a border of
2 px solid var(--green).

52
00:03:20.243 --> 00:03:27.041
Now, the moment I put all of that on the
page, notice what's happening down here.

53
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:28.070
Oops.

54
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.306
[LAUGH] It did that for
all of my icons as well.

55
00:03:32.306 --> 00:03:33.677
Why is that?

56
00:03:33.677 --> 00:03:39.128
Well, this is just a relationship
of a descendant selector, right?

57
00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:42.263
And these SVG is are inside
of an image element.

58
00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:44.347
And they are descended from the figure,

59
00:03:44.347 --> 00:03:46.928
even though their way
inside of a figure caption.

60
00:03:46.928 --> 00:03:51.919
So, to get just this first image,
what do we need to do?

61
00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.449
&gt;&gt; Greater than.

62
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:58.156
&gt;&gt; Put in a greater than sign,
and that'll get just the first

63
00:03:58.156 --> 00:04:02.881
image to be round with the border and
not affect the icons.

64
00:04:02.881 --> 00:04:05.859
Sweet little trick.

65
00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:12.108
Okay, next let's take a look
at our figure caption.

66
00:04:12.108 --> 00:04:13.774
So in our figure caption.

67
00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.994
First thing I'm gonna do generally
is just say text-align:center,

68
00:04:23.994 --> 00:04:30.463
because pretty much we want everything
centered, and that's an easy way to do it.

69
00:04:30.463 --> 00:04:34.554
Then, for
my h2 inside of the figure caption.

70
00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:39.137
Figcaption h2.

71
00:04:39.137 --> 00:04:39.805
A couple of things.

72
00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:45.251
So first of all, display: inline-block.

73
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:51.314
Mostly, what that's going to do for
me is make this a little bit smaller for

74
00:04:51.314 --> 00:04:54.601
some of the stuff that I'm going to add.

75
00:04:54.601 --> 00:04:59.704
Remember that an h2 is gonna
be as wide as its container.

76
00:04:59.704 --> 00:05:04.415
And if I, probably the easiest
thing to do is to do it those way.

77
00:05:04.415 --> 00:05:09.385
Border: 1px solid black.

78
00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:15.456
So right now, the width of the h2 is all
the way across Michelle's name here.

79
00:05:15.456 --> 00:05:20.436
And remember, one of the things that we
wanna do with this h2 is put that lovely

80
00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:24.980
fancy text effect on the bottom, but
we want it to be as wide as her name.

81
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.979
So by adding display:

82
00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.929
inline-block.

83
00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:36.741
We will make that box
just as wide as her name,

84
00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:40.295
with no padding on it,
without changing anything else.

85
00:05:40.295 --> 00:05:44.619
And we can still have margins and
padding on that h2 overall.

86
00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:47.792
So that's why we did that.

87
00:05:47.792 --> 00:05:51.622
Okay, so then,
I'm gonna go back to my fancy text.

88
00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:57.464
So in my base, if I scroll all the way
down, we can find our fancy text,

89
00:05:57.464 --> 00:06:01.043
and I'm going to copy my fancy text style.

90
00:06:01.043 --> 00:06:05.243
And I'm going to drop
that into my h2 here, and

91
00:06:05.243 --> 00:06:10.405
make some tweaks to it,
because this is a little bit tall.

92
00:06:10.405 --> 00:06:17.337
So we want this to be 100%, 20%.

93
00:06:17.337 --> 00:06:18.688
That's the big difference.

94
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:22.514
Here we go.

95
00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:25.632
Nice?

96
00:06:27.826 --> 00:06:30.507
Everything else can be the same.

97
00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:32.554
So we've got that part done, whew.

98
00:06:32.554 --> 00:06:34.484
Any questions on that so far?

99
00:06:34.484 --> 00:06:37.633
Hopefully, that wasn't too brutal.

100
00:06:37.633 --> 00:06:43.015
Okay, continuing on here,

101
00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:46.611
for figcaption p.

102
00:06:46.611 --> 00:06:49.932
So the paragraph or
the name of the person,

103
00:06:49.932 --> 00:06:55.852
we probably want that a little bit bigger,
font-size: var(-- h5).

104
00:06:55.852 --> 00:06:59.527
We'll make it a little bit bigger, nice.

105
00:06:59.527 --> 00:07:03.829
And I'm also gonna give that a margin: 0.

106
00:07:03.829 --> 00:07:06.973
Because, remember, our paragraphs
have some margin on them by default.

107
00:07:06.973 --> 00:07:13.277
By taking it off,
we'll put the owner closer to Michelle,

108
00:07:13.277 --> 00:07:17.447
and scrunch up that space a little bit.

109
00:07:17.447 --> 00:07:23.851
All right, so that takes care
of sort of general styling here.

110
00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:29.307
And those of you who are junior people,
like kind of just learning today,

111
00:07:29.307 --> 00:07:33.180
this is probably doable for
you, at least this far.
