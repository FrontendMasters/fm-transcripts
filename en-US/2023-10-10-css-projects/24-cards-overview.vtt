00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.160
This one I call the Outrageous Cards.

2
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.252
We have a bunch of different
layouts all baked into one card and

3
00:00:09.252 --> 00:00:13.702
I am going to show this to
you at the end state so

4
00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:16.880
you get a sense of how this goes.

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.077
All right.

6
00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:27.004
All right, so at Desktop Dimensions,

7
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:31.270
this would be an ordering page for
our coffee shop.

8
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.098
We have the Our Coffee up here on the top,
and

9
00:00:34.098 --> 00:00:38.160
you'll notice that we have cards,
because it's in the name.

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.377
We have the name of the item,
we have the picture of the item,

11
00:00:42.377 --> 00:00:46.370
we have the text underneath,
and we have buttons.

12
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.960
And of course those buttons have
hover states associated with them.

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.465
So, notice we have three
across here to start with, but

14
00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:58.400
notice that the two on the bottom are
centered underneath the three on the top.

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.030
So, you're gonna have to give some thought
as to how we make that magic happen.

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.491
How do we get these two to
show up kind of like that on

17
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:10.691
the row versus the three like this?

18
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.790
Okay, so that's your first thing to
think about there on the desktop.

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.380
As we make this smaller, there we go.

20
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.650
We'll hit our break point.

21
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.750
Notice what we've done here.

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.200
Coffee is now over here and
it's on Let's side, okay?

23
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.200
We have a big picture of the coffee,
we have our text here and

24
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.500
our ordering button here.

25
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.370
Okay, so that's the way this page looks.

26
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.390
Very lovely.

27
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.206
Then we're gonna make
the page even smaller.

28
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.700
Okay, and our next breakpoint,

29
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.474
what we're gonna do is move that order
button to go on top of the image.

30
00:01:57.474 --> 00:02:00.088
[SOUND] Good times.

31
00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:04.089
Okay, on top of the image
with the text underneath, and

32
00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:07.250
the titles are still
turned on their sides.

33
00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.059
Okay, and then at our last breakpoint,

34
00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:19.480
I have to show I have to go
back here to our source code.

35
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.506
And I have to crunch this thing down
because my browser doesn't go small

36
00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:24.630
enough.

37
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.540
So, at our last break point,
these are fairly simple cards.

38
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.562
So, we have the title,
the picture, the text, and

39
00:02:31.562 --> 00:02:33.850
the button underneath just like this.

40
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:43.853
Okay, so, What do we wanna think about as
we start putting these cards together?

41
00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:46.566
Anything come to mind you wanna mention,
Andrew?

42
00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:51.502
Anything strikes you about these cards?

43
00:02:51.502 --> 00:02:54.179
Anything you wonder about, perhaps?

44
00:02:55.863 --> 00:02:59.340
&gt;&gt; I'm certainly wondering how
to do a vertical text like that.

45
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
how do we do the vertical text like this?

46
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.930
That is craziness, okay?

47
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.491
You may be wondering how to put a button
on top of your image like this.

48
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:14.141
You just saw how to do something like
this with absolute positioning, but

49
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.290
spoiler alert,
you can also do it with CSS grid.

50
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.262
So that might be something
to think about for that.
