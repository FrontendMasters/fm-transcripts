1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.827
So we have a desktop-based layout here,
and

2
00:00:02.827 --> 00:00:06.989
the desktop layout is going to have
the two problems associated with it.

3
00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:09.960
Remember that the desktop
layout is going to have

4
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.461
the layout within the card itself and
the cards that are there on the page.

5
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:18.380
So if we look at our desktop layout,
we have our cards,

6
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.275
somehow you've got to get those order now
buttons all lined up across the bottom.

7
00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:26.524
That'll be a little bit tricky for you.

8
00:00:26.524 --> 00:00:31.567
The images should be all the same height,
we've talked about how to do that.

9
00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:34.358
Notice that the paragraphs
are in line with the images.

10
00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:38.716
Right now they're indented a little bit,
so that'll be something else to address.

11
00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:43.197
And then you're gonna have to figure
out how you can get the three across,

12
00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:47.109
and then the two that seem to be
centered there in the second row.

13
00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.821
Rather than having those two
lined up under the first two,

14
00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:53.866
which is how this is normally done for
layouts.

15
00:00:53.866 --> 00:01:02.217
So give that a shot now, their desktop
breakpoint will start at 1025 pixels.

16
00:01:02.217 --> 00:01:06.690
So add yourself a media query
down here at 1025 pixels,

17
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.275
and I'll show you my
answer here momentarily.

18
00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:17.340
Hopefully, you've all got
that desktop layout in place.

19
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.618
Let's go through my solution here.

20
00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:23.400
Now, for the starting media query,

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.799
I had given you a width of 1025 pixels.

22
00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.158
I'm gonna use 900 here, mostly because
I need a little bit more room to code.

23
00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:37.360
My screen is only 1440 pixels wide,
so I'm just gonna modify this media

24
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.258
query a little bit, but you can
stick with 1025 as you are working.

25
00:01:42.258 --> 00:01:47.887
So our media query is gonna have a min
width of, in my case, 900 pixels.

26
00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:55.508
And now what I wanna do is tell you we've
got two layout problems that are going

27
00:01:55.508 --> 00:01:56.100
on here.

28
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.140
We have the card layout itself and we have
the relation of the cards to each other.

29
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.019
So the first problem I'm gonna
solve is the card layout itself.

30
00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:10.865
So to do this,
we are gonna start with .card.

31
00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:13.847
And we're gonna continue on
with what we have from before.

32
00:02:13.847 --> 00:02:18.435
We have a series of grid-based
layouts in our cards from before, so

33
00:02:18.435 --> 00:02:21.582
that grid-based layout will continue here.

34
00:02:21.582 --> 00:02:28.590
We are gonna set the grid
template columns to 1fr and

35
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.439
we're gonna set our grid
template rows to 10%,

36
00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.753
50%, 20%, and 20%.

37
00:02:42.283 --> 00:02:43.437
There we go.

38
00:02:43.437 --> 00:02:46.677
All right, now things are starting to move
on the page, but they still look weird.

39
00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:51.735
Remember that each of these elements has
assigned to it already, a grid column and

40
00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:56.006
a grid row value that we're going to
need to reset for our new layout.

41
00:02:56.006 --> 00:03:00.099
So we will continue on with that.

42
00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.142
I'm gonna set my margin on my cards to 0,

43
00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:08.069
the padding on my cards to 0 as well, and

44
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.089
then we will address each element here.,
so our .card h2.

45
00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.726
We need to turn off the placement for
our previous h2.

46
00:03:17.726 --> 00:03:22.846
So this would be grid-column: auto.

47
00:03:22.846 --> 00:03:27.710
Previously, we had something like whatever
to /5, now we set it to auto, and

48
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.482
that will turn off that
particular setting.

49
00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:33.563
We won't see much change here with the h2,

50
00:03:33.563 --> 00:03:37.821
because it's already yet
the first column in the first row.

51
00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:42.220
Grid-row: auto.

52
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.642
All right, then of course, we have some
other things to do here with this h2.

53
00:03:46.642 --> 00:03:52.692
I'm gonna give it a bit
of margin of 2rem and.

54
00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.306
Auto.

55
00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:02.082
I'm gonna say text-align: center.

56
00:04:02.082 --> 00:04:03.820
And of course, we need to turn it around.

57
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:12.183
So our writing mode will be horizontal-tb.

58
00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:13.981
And so horizontal, of course,

59
00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:18.252
we're now gonna go horizontally instead
of vertically, tb top to bottom.

60
00:04:18.252 --> 00:04:21.497
Yeah, all right.

61
00:04:21.497 --> 00:04:27.712
Then we're gonna go on to our card image,

62
00:04:27.712 --> 00:04:31.976
.card.card-image, and

63
00:04:31.976 --> 00:04:38.556
grid-column: auto, grid-row: auto.

64
00:04:38.556 --> 00:04:40.774
Totally awesome.

65
00:04:40.774 --> 00:04:44.216
So, we're just turning off that location.

66
00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:47.384
We have our .card p,

67
00:04:47.384 --> 00:04:53.899
grid-column: auto, grid-row: auto.

68
00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:58.672
We can also turn off or
change some padding,

69
00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:01.645
1rem: 0, margin: 0.

70
00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:09.558
Then for our button at the end here,

71
00:05:09.558 --> 00:05:14.255
the .card p:last-of-type.

72
00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:22.328
We're gonna say again grid-column: auto,

73
00:05:22.328 --> 00:05:27.779
grid-row: auto, align-self: start.

74
00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:33.013
And what that's gonna
do is move this button

75
00:05:33.013 --> 00:05:39.102
around here in space and
justify-self: center.

76
00:05:39.102 --> 00:05:40.319
There we go.

77
00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:45.058
So that is gonna give us a button
that's pretty much as wide as the text.

78
00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:46.344
And ultimately,

79
00:05:46.344 --> 00:05:51.494
those buttons will wind up lining up
in a row once we lay them out as such.

80
00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:57.110
The very last thing I need to do is
turn off some padding on this button.

81
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.761
margin: 0.

82
00:06:00.761 --> 00:06:03.574
Okay, so now I have a series of cards.

83
00:06:03.574 --> 00:06:05.646
They're all stacked on top of each other,
and

84
00:06:05.646 --> 00:06:07.996
this is the way that I'm
gonna want them to display.

85
00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:13.292
So the next thing to do is to get
the cards to all display here on the page.

86
00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:16.094
And anytime you see this style of layout,

87
00:06:16.094 --> 00:06:19.466
where elements are not
aligning with each other.

88
00:06:19.466 --> 00:06:25.527
In other words, we've got those two items,
those two cards in that second row,

89
00:06:25.527 --> 00:06:29.463
they are by themselves and
in the center of the page.

90
00:06:29.463 --> 00:06:34.047
This is a dead giveaway that this is
Flexbox because Grid will not allow that

91
00:06:34.047 --> 00:06:35.080
kind of layout.

92
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.207
Grid will always be aligned with those
other two columns there at the start,

93
00:06:40.207 --> 00:06:44.375
so cappuccino under coffee and
macchiato under iced coffee,

94
00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:46.313
that would be a grid layout.

95
00:06:46.313 --> 00:06:49.925
Anytime you see this kind of thing,
it's definitely Flexbox.

96
00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:54.408
So let's go through and
set this up with Flexbox.

97
00:06:54.408 --> 00:06:59.471
Once again, in our HTML, we will look

98
00:06:59.471 --> 00:07:05.344
at our children and
parents as we always do.

99
00:07:05.344 --> 00:07:10.552
And when we do that, you will see
that we have a section with the card

100
00:07:10.552 --> 00:07:16.045
container class on it, and we have
five articles with a class of card.

101
00:07:16.045 --> 00:07:20.257
So the card container will
wind up being our flex parent,

102
00:07:20.257 --> 00:07:23.873
our individual cards will
be our flex children.

103
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.612
All right, so to set this up.

104
00:07:33.605 --> 00:07:37.179
I'm gonna go back here to
the top of my media query, and

105
00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.760
I'm gonna put in my card-container.

106
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:46.654
Okay, so what we're gonna say now is,
of course, display flex.

107
00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:50.682
flex-flow: row wrap.

108
00:07:50.682 --> 00:07:54.725
The wrapping part is really important
because we want this to wrap onto

109
00:07:54.725 --> 00:07:55.624
a second line.

110
00:07:55.624 --> 00:07:59.146
By default, the property FlexFlow
is set to row no wrap, and

111
00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:02.400
as you see,
that crams everybody together on the line.

112
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.973
It's kind of a cool look for those images.

113
00:08:03.973 --> 00:08:09.447
If you like it, you can keep it,
but not in the design that I have.

114
00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:16.851
Actually, before I go any further with
this and put in more properties for

115
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:21.791
my card container, the cards themselves,
as you can see are as wide as

116
00:08:21.791 --> 00:08:25.682
my screen right now because
that image is quite large.

117
00:08:25.682 --> 00:08:28.781
So we need to assign
a width to these cards.

118
00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:33.231
When we are working with Flexbox,
we do not use the width property,

119
00:08:33.231 --> 00:08:35.978
the property that we use is flex-basis.

120
00:08:35.978 --> 00:08:37.476
And the difference is this.

121
00:08:37.476 --> 00:08:43.362
Width is an absolute value,
if I'd say it's a width of 25%,

122
00:08:43.362 --> 00:08:49.357
it will never be 24.9 or
25.1, it will always be 25%.

123
00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:53.967
In the case of flex-basis,
if I say it's 30% wide,

124
00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:58.971
that's a kinda number,
it may wind up being 28% 27%,

125
00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:04.582
maybe there'll be 33%, but
kind of it'll get close to 30%.

126
00:09:04.582 --> 00:09:09.786
So that's the way the difference
between width and flex-bases.

127
00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:16.847
So here on my card itself,
we'll set our flex-basis to 30%.

128
00:09:16.847 --> 00:09:20.902
And that will give us our three
cards here on the top, and

129
00:09:20.902 --> 00:09:24.196
that'll give us two down
here on the bottom.

130
00:09:26.571 --> 00:09:29.012
So we're getting there.

131
00:09:29.012 --> 00:09:32.500
Now, here on my card container,

132
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.990
I can give this a gap of,
let's say, 5 rem, 4%.

133
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:44.646
So we'll get some distance in between each
of these cards and in between the rows.

134
00:09:44.646 --> 00:09:48.004
And then how to get them all centered and
looking pretty?

135
00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:57.988
That will be justify-content:
space-evenly.

136
00:09:57.988 --> 00:10:02.872
And so that will take however many cards
you have in a row and space them evenly,

137
00:10:02.872 --> 00:10:06.350
so you wind up with the look
that you are looking at here.

138
00:10:09.153 --> 00:10:12.749
I add some other styles that
are here on this card container.

139
00:10:12.749 --> 00:10:16.078
Just for completeness,

140
00:10:16.078 --> 00:10:21.316
we have a max width of 1200 pixels.

141
00:10:21.316 --> 00:10:23.232
We have our padding.

142
00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:29.214
Of 0, 2rem, 5rem, 2rem.

143
00:10:29.214 --> 00:10:34.958
So they'll give us padding all
the way around our card container and.

144
00:10:36.661 --> 00:10:42.576
Margin: 0 auto to center
the whole thing on the page.

145
00:10:42.576 --> 00:10:45.532
So when the screen gets really large, and

146
00:10:45.532 --> 00:10:49.764
I can't make it quite big enough here,
but you can at home.

147
00:10:49.764 --> 00:10:53.964
You'll see that we'll have the extra
space, it'll be spaced evenly on the left

148
00:10:53.964 --> 00:10:58.315
and the right sides, and you can see that
our cards line up evenly under each other.

149
00:10:58.315 --> 00:11:03.096
You can also see that our buttons
are all aligned perfectly on

150
00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.638
the same line here in our cards.

151
00:11:05.638 --> 00:11:11.201
And so that is the solution
to the outrageous cards.

152
00:11:11.201 --> 00:11:15.465
We now have all five different
layouts all baked into this.

153
00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:16.864
Pretty amazing.
