1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.100
I want you to create the tablet layout and
the desktop layout.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.960
And so all that there is
here to think about is what?

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.360
We've got the hard part of
the styling done, right?

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.190
And these are all stacked
on top of each other.

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.182
So as we move to tablet and
we move to desktop,

6
00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:23.240
what do we need to think about
here inside of our web page?

7
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.710
&gt;&gt; Grids.

8
00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:31.780
&gt;&gt; We have a bunch of figures here, right?

9
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.900
We need to think about putting those
figures two across or three across.

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.710
So if you don't have one, you're going to
need to add a parent to all those figures.

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.050
I've called mine a div
with a class of team.

12
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.710
That will be the parent for your layout.

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.490
Then all of the individual figures
will serve as the children.

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.067
And you should be able to write two
media queries that are going to give

15
00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:59.910
you two across or three across.

16
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.342
And those breakpoints are at, 675 and

17
00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:11.060
1000, so we're going to have
media queries after this.

18
00:01:13.536 --> 00:01:19.109
So @media (min-width:,

19
00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.922
675px).

20
00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:33.895
Okay, and then we're going to have
the same thing right after that for

21
00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:35.218
1000 pixels.

22
00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:41.230
Okay, sound good?

23
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.389
You can do this in three styles.

24
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.995
You can do this in three styles.

25
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:59.110
All right, so the end of this team
challenge is actually not that difficult.

26
00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.940
This is a pretty straightforward two
column versus three column grid system.

27
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.070
We don't need to change anything
with the figures that took a lot of

28
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.291
time to lay out in the mobile design,
so let's go through that now.

29
00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:20.770
So here at 675 pixels, this is where we
wanna have two people across on the page.

30
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.865
So we can add some
additional styling here.

31
00:02:24.865 --> 00:02:27.385
My fancy text is gonna get a bit bigger,

32
00:02:30.866 --> 00:02:37.644
font-size: var(--xl).

33
00:02:37.644 --> 00:02:40.193
And then, in case you missed it,

34
00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:44.740
I did put a div with a class of
team around all of my figures.

35
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.306
I'm going to need that in order to do,
whether I do Flexbox or grid,

36
00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:51.515
we need to have a container
around all of those items inside.

37
00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:55.620
So we have our parent child relationship,
and

38
00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.417
now what we'll do is
set up our team style.

39
00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.041
And we just say display: grid.

40
00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:16.039
And then grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr,

41
00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:22.080
and we can set up a gap of 2 rem.

42
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.971
So a little bit of space
in between all of those.

43
00:03:29.101 --> 00:03:32.364
And if we need a little bit of
space on the top of the page,

44
00:03:32.364 --> 00:03:33.763
it looks like we might.

45
00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:40.550
I can always add a bit of margin,
like 3 rem auto, kinda like that.

46
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.860
I'll push this down the page,
off the top there a little bit.

47
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.300
And give us a little space
down here at the bottom.

48
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.050
So that would be something
else you could do.

49
00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.142
And that's it, there you go,
you got your two across for

50
00:03:53.142 --> 00:03:55.500
your team here on this page.

51
00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.240
And then the last part is for
our 1000 pixel wide breakpoint.

52
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.862
All we have to do is change
the number of columns.

53
00:04:03.862 --> 00:04:09.308
So for .team, We'll

54
00:04:09.308 --> 00:04:16.944
say grid-template-columns
is repeat(3,1fr).

55
00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.588
So when I make the screens wider,
then we'll wind up with three across.

56
00:04:25.774 --> 00:04:28.506
Everything else carries down
from the previous breakpoint.

57
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:34.220
So we are all set there with that team.

58
00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.365
In fact, now I'm looking at this,
I'm looking at this on mobile,

59
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.400
it looks like I need the space here.

60
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.314
So I can shift that space,

61
00:04:41.314 --> 00:04:46.330
I assigned it here inside of
the media query to the team style.

62
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.335
I can go outside the media query,
create a team style here,

63
00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:55.550
and apply that 3 rems
outside of the media query.

64
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.131
And now I've got it there
across all of my breakpoints.

65
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:01.946
Yeah, that's a little bit better.

66
00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:03.492
Okay.

67
00:05:06.712 --> 00:05:09.010
So super fun, questions on that?

68
00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:15.983
Fantastic, yes.

69
00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:19.353
&gt;&gt; One question about the positioning or
the order of the CSS.

70
00:05:19.353 --> 00:05:20.242
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

71
00:05:20.242 --> 00:05:23.774
&gt;&gt; Can you explain one more
time why the last of type and

72
00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:26.040
only type rule has to be first?

73
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.430
&gt;&gt; First, right?

74
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.030
Okay, so we can have one,
two, or three icons.

75
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.325
So the one that we want to have,
if we only have one icon,

76
00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:42.280
that one icon can be addressed
by actually three selectors.

77
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.487
One single icon,
could be the first-of-type,

78
00:05:46.487 --> 00:05:52.208
the last-of-type, or the only-of-type,
[LAUGH] any of those.

79
00:05:52.208 --> 00:05:55.869
In which case, we have no idea
where it's going to wind up going.

80
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.396
So that winds up being our first one
because it has the only-of-type,

81
00:06:01.396 --> 00:06:03.280
that will be our first one here.

82
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.170
If we have two, we have that position of
that first icon, whether it's, I guess,

83
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:15.216
in that case, it would be
the first-of-type, the last-of-type.

84
00:06:15.216 --> 00:06:19.007
So we have two and
a last-of-type in that particular case.

85
00:06:19.007 --> 00:06:23.709
We don't have the first-of-type, the
first-of-type winds up being an exception.

86
00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:27.671
The reason it's kind of backwards
is because we have one icon here is

87
00:06:27.671 --> 00:06:28.442
the anchor.

88
00:06:28.442 --> 00:06:33.048
This one icon in the lower part
cuz that's what the design said,

89
00:06:33.048 --> 00:06:36.250
is our anchor for all of the other ones.

90
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.123
And so that has to be our last-of-type, or

91
00:06:40.123 --> 00:06:45.000
the only-of-type,
all of those kinds of things.

92
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.550
So the first-of-type up here is only gonna
show up if there happen to be three icons.

93
00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:57.379
Right, okay,
I got a good response over here.

94
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:02.553
&gt;&gt; So the numbers, so 55, 5, even though
that was what you were typing when

95
00:07:02.553 --> 00:07:07.060
the first one showed up, that's actually
the coordinates of the highest one?

96
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.333
&gt;&gt; It winds up being up here, yep.

97
00:07:10.333 --> 00:07:12.993
And then, of course, the middle
one winds up being in the middle.

98
00:07:12.993 --> 00:07:17.760
So if we have two of them,
it will be position one and two.

99
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.119
And if we have three of them,

100
00:07:19.119 --> 00:07:22.200
two is still in that same spot
before we add the last one.

101
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.100
So that's why we had to shift
these around in this odd order.

102
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.922
Because they all have more or
less the same specificity and

103
00:07:29.922 --> 00:07:31.820
they override each other.

104
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:35.213
And so that was another consideration
as I put this together,

105
00:07:35.213 --> 00:07:39.260
because I needed to have things
overridden in a very specific way.

106
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.602
So first-of-type winds up being
the last one on the list.

107
00:07:42.602 --> 00:07:46.274
So, great question, I'm so
glad you asked that.
