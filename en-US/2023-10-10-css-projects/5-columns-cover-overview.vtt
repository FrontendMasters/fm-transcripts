1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.937
So let's move on to our second challenge,
so

2
00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:09.520
called challenge 1B,
which is called Columns and Cover.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.430
So this is a longer piece
of text plus an image.

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.087
The markup is gonna remain the same
while your layout is gonna change

5
00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:19.870
significantly through your breakpoints.

6
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.290
So what was step one of
our four-step process?

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.200
What is step one?

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.439
&gt;&gt; Study the screenshots.

9
00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.930
&gt;&gt; Study these screenshots and
evaluate what's going on here.

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.645
So let us do that.

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.260
All right, so this is the desktop
version of the web page.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.524
Anybody wanna make any comments on this?

13
00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:50.914
&gt;&gt; Text is in three columns
&gt;&gt; Text is in three columns.

14
00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:52.640
&gt;&gt; The same width as the image,
the whole text area.

15
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.880
&gt;&gt; It's all lined up there very nicely
with the image, yeah, what else?

16
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.000
&gt;&gt; There's sizable margins at the side.

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.520
&gt;&gt; Kind of sizable margins at
the side here on desktop, yeah.

18
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.600
&gt;&gt; Everything is left aligned
within the overall centered boxes.

19
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.910
&gt;&gt; We're definitely left aligned, yeah.

20
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.689
Anybody wanna comment on that content?

21
00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.612
So notice that we're going from
preparing a cup of instant coffee

22
00:01:24.612 --> 00:01:29.470
more than made up for
our perceived inferior taste.

23
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.770
So these are not three
separate chunks of text.

24
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.240
This is the same article
laid out in three columns.

25
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.310
Okay, that header,
does that look familiar to you?

26
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.750
Ha, that looks like something
we might recycle, yeah, okay?

27
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.735
&gt;&gt; Is it intentional that Instant
is a little bit different size than

28
00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:53.490
Coffee Facts?

29
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.254
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.

30
00:01:54.254 --> 00:01:58.157
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay, all right, when I go here,

31
00:01:58.157 --> 00:02:00.460
what's going on now?

32
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.810
&gt;&gt; Side by side.

33
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.484
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so now we have the image side
by side with a column of text, and

34
00:02:07.484 --> 00:02:10.370
look at that, it's the same image.

35
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.020
See the coffee packet here?

36
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.055
Same image.

37
00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:19.926
&gt;&gt; Nice, instead of making itself
smaller to fit the new margins size that

38
00:02:19.926 --> 00:02:24.487
we wanna fit, it's instead zooming in and
slicing out the image.

39
00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:25.360
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

40
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.710
&gt;&gt; There's a better word for that.

41
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.740
&gt;&gt; Kind of masking is what we
would call it in Photoshop, right?

42
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.740
We call it masking.

43
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.650
Okay, how do we do that magic?

44
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.280
All right, with all the text here and
one column on the side, yeah?

45
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.999
And then here for mobile.

46
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.428
What's different here?

47
00:02:45.428 --> 00:02:47.100
&gt;&gt; The order of the elements.

48
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.590
&gt;&gt; The order of the elements, right?

49
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.560
For desktop, the image is at the bottom.

50
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.629
For mobile, the image is at the top.

51
00:02:57.551 --> 00:03:00.380
Boy, yeah?

52
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.490
Okay, so let's take a look real quick.

53
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.160
Now at your beginning CodePen,
or in the questions as well.

54
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.520
So when any developers see columns,
they think about Flexbox or grid.

55
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.890
Is that the best approach here?

56
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.269
Anybody have any comment on that?

57
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.110
So when developers see grid columns like
this, they think about Flexbox or grid.

58
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.860
Is that the right approach here?

59
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.540
&gt;&gt; I think so.

60
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.334
&gt;&gt; You think so, why?

61
00:03:31.334 --> 00:03:33.949
&gt;&gt; I think yes because I
took a class with you-

62
00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:37.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

63
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.692
&gt;&gt; And we literally had things to

64
00:03:39.692 --> 00:03:44.688
rearrange orders of elements based on
some fancy properties we would give them.

65
00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:48.965
And those would be able to be
determined by media breakpoints, or

66
00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:50.770
media query breakpoints.

67
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's some media query magic
going on here to make the columns.

68
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.550
But Anna, you were disagreeing.

69
00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.840
&gt;&gt; I was gonna say no just because I have
not seen it applied this way [CROSSTALK].

70
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.180
I'm very excited to learn how to do that.

71
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.019
&gt;&gt; Okay, so remember that that break
happened in the middle of a sentence.

72
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.760
Okay, so Flexbox and
grid assume that you're gonna have an HTML

73
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.690
element bordering that chunk of text,
right?

74
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.187
This is presumably in the middle of
a paragraph that we have this break

75
00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:21.862
happening.

76
00:04:23.392 --> 00:04:24.802
Ooh.

77
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.010
&gt;&gt; These are three separate paragraphs.

78
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.872
&gt;&gt; There are three paragraphs, but

79
00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:34.380
the break in the text here is happening
in the middle of the paragraph.

80
00:04:36.549 --> 00:04:41.275
Whoa, so I will point you to, the name of

81
00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:46.424
the challenge is Columns and Cover, okay?

82
00:04:46.424 --> 00:04:50.871
There are some hints and spoilers down
here that you can take a look at if you

83
00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:53.620
need to that might help you with this.

84
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.721
Also, the other thing to think about
is that the image is remaining the same

85
00:04:56.721 --> 00:04:58.110
in the same location in the code.

86
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.110
So how do we get it to change the sizes so
radically?

87
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.899
Again, the name of the challenge
is columns and cover.

88
00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.200
&gt;&gt; Cover.

89
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.690
&gt;&gt; Cover, cover, columns and
cover, might be two things.

90
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.090
If you wanna look at the hints and
the spoilers,

91
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.580
it might help you out here, okay?

92
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.070
So if we open up our CodePen,
let me just show you.

93
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.795
Your first step is going to be to take
all of this content that you see here and

94
00:05:25.795 --> 00:05:27.904
mark it up semantically, okay?

95
00:05:27.904 --> 00:05:30.830
And then we're gonna go
through the answer for that.

96
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.841
The other thing I just
wanna point you to here,

97
00:05:33.841 --> 00:05:36.775
this is the only time I
have to point this out,

98
00:05:36.775 --> 00:05:41.739
is that I now have this thing around
the styles, it's called @layer base.

99
00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:48.410
And I put it in here, @layer is a way
of managing the cascade inside of CSS.

100
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.271
We are fake using it here just to group
those base styles together that we

101
00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:57.010
wrote in the stylesheet,
so that's what's in here.

102
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.160
This is all the stuff that we just
wrote in the stylesheet carrying over,

103
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.848
all right?

104
00:06:01.848 --> 00:06:05.215
And we can fold it up and
forget about it now,

105
00:06:05.215 --> 00:06:10.768
cuz it's just going to apply to
the semantic HTML, makes sense, okay.
