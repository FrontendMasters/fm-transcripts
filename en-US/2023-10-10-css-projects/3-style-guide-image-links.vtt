1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.148
Okay, good, so let's move on here.

2
00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:08.130
The next thing I wanna do is address the
picture that's down here at the bottom.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.300
The picture is kind of ridiculously big.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.765
So what did you guys do to
deal with this picture, yeah.

5
00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:21.270
&gt;&gt; I just did width 97 vw,
cuz that's what the screenshot looks like.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.830
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you just said img like this?

7
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.880
&gt;&gt; Yes.

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.788
&gt;&gt; Okay, and you said width of 97vw, okay.

9
00:00:32.788 --> 00:00:36.410
So that is definitely one
way to deal with this.

10
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.011
Anybody wanna discuss that, positives and
negatives of going this way?

11
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.231
&gt;&gt; I think the positive would be it's
the height of whatever screen you're

12
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:45.930
viewing it on.

13
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.190
&gt;&gt; Right, so as I change the size of the
screen, it's obviously gonna scale, right?

14
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.000
Anything else?

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.949
Are all of my images gonna take
up the full width of the screen?

16
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.310
Probably not, so this is probably not
the best choice in this specific case.

17
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.320
But we're trying to be general here
across all of the images on the site.

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.349
So probably the better way to go for

19
00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:18.061
this is going to be just
say a max-width of 100%.

20
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.353
Don't be any bigger than the picture is,
okay?

21
00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:26.529
So what will happen then is, and
I can't make my screen big enough for

22
00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:31.141
this picture, the picture is gonna
continue to grow until we hit the maximum

23
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.840
width of the picture, and
then it's gonna stop growing.

24
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.992
And that's actually a really good thing,
because otherwise if it kept growing,

25
00:01:39.992 --> 00:01:43.140
it would get ridiculously fuzzy,
right, okay.

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.738
&gt;&gt; I get the same response
when they add a width is 100%.

27
00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:51.671
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You can set the width to 100%.

28
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:55.200
Setting the width to 100%,
a question is always, relative to what?

29
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.600
The width is 100% relative to what?

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.600
Is it the size of the screen?

31
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.903
Is it its container?

32
00:02:04.903 --> 00:02:08.640
So it depends, but again,
that's another situation where the image

33
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.360
can stretch beyond the actual
width of the image itself.

34
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.500
Because images have an inherent
width to them, right?

35
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.938
So max-width will ensure that it doesn't
stretch beyond that inherent width

36
00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:21.070
of the image.

37
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.052
&gt;&gt; So max-width is based on
the image's properties and

38
00:02:23.052 --> 00:02:24.320
not the element's properties?

39
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.600
&gt;&gt; Correct, on the image's properties.

40
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.660
&gt;&gt; Blown my mind here.

41
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.536
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's why we use this.

42
00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.320
&gt;&gt; But width is-
&gt;&gt; But width is,

43
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.091
could be relative to its container,
whatever that container is.

44
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.279
Whether it's the body, whether it's
some div, whether it's an article,

45
00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.545
whether it's whatever it happens to be.

46
00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:45.777
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, well.

47
00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:47.886
&gt;&gt; Yeah, relative to what?

48
00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:52.073
There are a lot of questions that
people don't understand in CSS.

49
00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:56.807
And if you understand these handful of
questions, it all clicks into place.

50
00:02:56.807 --> 00:03:00.305
Relative to what [LAUGH] is one of them,
[LAUGH] and

51
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:03.459
what is it inheriting is the other, okay?

52
00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.719
And those are pretty much,
whenever you run into any problems in CSS,

53
00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.088
relative to what and what is it
inheriting will solve all your problems,

54
00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:12.150
if you can think about
those two questions.

55
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.353
Okay, so what other thing could we
give to this, sort of globally?

56
00:03:20.314 --> 00:03:23.932
How about a border radius?

57
00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:32.960
Border-radius, var, whoops,
border-radius: (var --radius), here we go.

58
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:36.632
It's a very subtle radius,
it's just 5 pixels,

59
00:03:36.632 --> 00:03:39.144
but we just trim off
the little points on the ends.

60
00:03:41.834 --> 00:03:44.718
Okay, now if we look at our HTML,

61
00:03:44.718 --> 00:03:50.186
we know that our image is inside
of the figure element, right?

62
00:03:50.186 --> 00:03:53.429
Okay, and notice that our image is
not pushed to the side of the page.

63
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:57.477
So what's going on there?

64
00:03:57.477 --> 00:03:59.224
&gt;&gt; Figure itself has a margin.

65
00:03:59.224 --> 00:04:01.653
&gt;&gt; How did you find out that
the figure itself has a margin?

66
00:04:04.932 --> 00:04:07.117
&gt;&gt; With the clues that you gave me?

67
00:04:07.117 --> 00:04:11.510
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; When in doubt, put a border on it.

68
00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.237
Okay, border, usually I use red, but

69
00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:19.130
it doesn't really work with this
color scheme, so 1 px solid black.

70
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.440
Okay, look, so the border is
around the picture and the words,

71
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.390
and those are all smashed to the edge.

72
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.704
But then we have a space between
the border and the edge of the web page.

73
00:04:32.704 --> 00:04:36.988
So is that space between the border and
the edge of the web page, is that padding,

74
00:04:36.988 --> 00:04:37.870
or is it margin?

75
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:38.973
&gt;&gt; Margin.

76
00:04:38.973 --> 00:04:39.613
&gt;&gt; Margin.

77
00:04:39.613 --> 00:04:41.127
&gt;&gt; Margin, right?

78
00:04:41.127 --> 00:04:46.289
Margin is outside of the border,
inside the border is padding.

79
00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:53.035
So what we can do then is say margin is 0,
this comes from the web browser.

80
00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:55.700
And that'll push it over, and
then we can turn off our border.

81
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:05.964
Okay, we have a link to style,
how did you guys style the link?

82
00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:07.100
&gt;&gt; Didn't get there [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Didn't get there?

83
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.640
&gt;&gt; Didn't get there.

84
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.960
&gt;&gt; How would you style a link?

85
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.670
Anybody wanna take a guess,
how do we generically style links?

86
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.124
&gt;&gt; Well, we want to apply that color.

87
00:05:19.124 --> 00:05:21.264
&gt;&gt; Go on, Anna.

88
00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:23.522
&gt;&gt; Generically styled links are, sorry.

89
00:05:23.522 --> 00:05:24.861
&gt;&gt; All the links.
&gt;&gt; You said generically style links and

90
00:05:24.861 --> 00:05:26.510
I was thinking about this specifically,
so.

91
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.000
&gt;&gt; All the links in the document.

92
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.210
&gt;&gt; To target the links,
you could use the a element.

93
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.710
&gt;&gt; a, yep, just plain old a.

94
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.920
Just like that,
because the HTML is plain old a, right?

95
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.359
There it is.

96
00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:44.465
So I have a color of var, I did it again,

97
00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:47.920
color: var(--green).

98
00:05:51.805 --> 00:05:54.950
Okay, so that makes it green.

99
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.970
And then I wanna change the hover state.

100
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.907
So how would I do that?

101
00:05:58.907 --> 00:05:59.702
&gt;&gt; a:hover.

102
00:05:59.702 --> 00:06:05.460
&gt;&gt; a:hover, and I can turn that off.

103
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.268
How would I do that?

104
00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:09.280
&gt;&gt; text-decoration:none?

105
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.400
&gt;&gt; Good, text-decoration: none.

106
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:17.670
So now when you roll your mouse over
at the blue underline should go away.

107
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.080
So you're gonna do some sort of generic
link styling here in your style guide.

108
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.450
These are for links that are probably
going to show up inside of a paragraph.

109
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.698
When you get to your nav bar,

110
00:06:28.698 --> 00:06:32.032
when you get to buttons, you get to all
kinds of other things, you're gonna

111
00:06:32.032 --> 00:06:36.090
completely style those links completely
differently and override those, yes.

112
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:40.820
&gt;&gt; Why does the body color not
override the color of the link?

113
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.827
&gt;&gt; So the body has a background
color to it, right?

114
00:06:43.827 --> 00:06:48.975
And we set the color to be brown.

115
00:06:48.975 --> 00:06:52.098
By default, in your browser stylesheet,

116
00:06:52.098 --> 00:06:55.752
it's a white background with black text,
okay?

117
00:06:55.752 --> 00:06:57.734
And so we overrode that.

118
00:06:57.734 --> 00:07:03.898
Inside of that browser's stylesheet,
the link is actually coded to be blue and

119
00:07:03.898 --> 00:07:08.770
underlined, and purple when visited,
and no hover state.

120
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:11.200
All of that is inside of
the browser stylesheet.

121
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.987
Because you can think of
that as being closer,

122
00:07:13.987 --> 00:07:16.425
that styling is closer to that element.

123
00:07:16.425 --> 00:07:20.070
That overrides what comes from the body,
which is inherited.

124
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.548
So the browser styles apply until
we write our own styles, and

125
00:07:26.548 --> 00:07:31.128
then we override what the browser is doing
&gt;&gt; For

126
00:07:31.128 --> 00:07:33.220
links specifically,
because they've been styled already?

127
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:38.865
&gt;&gt; Exactly, links have been styled
already inside of the web browser, yeah.

128
00:07:38.865 --> 00:07:42.318
And if you guys want more on that,
intermediate HTML and

129
00:07:42.318 --> 00:07:44.678
CSS course here at Frontend Masters.

130
00:07:44.678 --> 00:07:47.598
I spend a lot, a lot, a lot of
time explaining about the cascade,

131
00:07:47.598 --> 00:07:49.840
and then inheritance, and
how all of that works.

132
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.121
So that would be something for
you to watch.

133
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:55.090
&gt;&gt; Is that the same principle
as if we were just, say,

134
00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:57.176
put a margin or padding on the body?

135
00:07:57.176 --> 00:08:00.319
And then that's the same reason why
that's not inherited to paragraph?

136
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.404
&gt;&gt; Yes, so in that specific case, if we
say 0 padding and margin on the body,

137
00:08:06.404 --> 00:08:09.270
why isn't that inherited, anybody know?

138
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.163
If we said that we have 0 on the body, why
do our paragraphs still have padding and

139
00:08:15.163 --> 00:08:16.260
margin?

140
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.830
&gt;&gt; Based on what we just said,
it's specificity.

141
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.615
&gt;&gt; It could be a specificity thing, but in
this particular case, generally speaking,

142
00:08:23.615 --> 00:08:27.137
properties that are associated
with the box model, padding,

143
00:08:27.137 --> 00:08:32.430
margin, borders, layouts, all kinds of
things like that, do not inherit, right?

144
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:39.864
Cuz if it did inherit, if I put
a border: 10px solid red on the body,

145
00:08:39.864 --> 00:08:47.760
I should wind up with borders on
all of my elements, but I don't.

146
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.220
And that's because borders don't inherit.

147
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:54.215
Likewise for padding and margin and
so forth, those things don't inherit,

148
00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:55.480
make sense?

149
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.430
Not everything inherits, that has to
do with text, generally it inherits.

150
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:03.607
If it has to do with the box model,
generally it doesn't.

151
00:09:03.607 --> 00:09:05.613
&gt;&gt; I know this isn't globally applicable,
and

152
00:09:05.613 --> 00:09:09.378
it probably breaks very quickly once you
get into more intermediate details of CSS.

153
00:09:09.378 --> 00:09:12.802
But coming from an educational
psychology background,

154
00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.550
[LAUGH] I found myself thinking
about parent and child.

155
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.080
&gt;&gt; Yes.

156
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.535
&gt;&gt; Like the child will only
inherit very specific and

157
00:09:19.535 --> 00:09:21.964
almost sort of subconscious aspects-
&gt;&gt; Yes.

158
00:09:21.964 --> 00:09:26.985
&gt;&gt; From the parent, and once they get to
the level of having their own specific

159
00:09:26.985 --> 00:09:31.780
style, they will generally rebel
against the default parent styles.

160
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:32.400
&gt;&gt; There you go.

161
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.580
&gt;&gt; In most ways, but not always.

162
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.596
There will always be some
subconscious inheritances

163
00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:37.265
that need to be-
&gt;&gt; Love it.

164
00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:38.034
&gt;&gt; Specifically overwritten.

165
00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:40.797
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I love it, we do talk about parents and

166
00:09:40.797 --> 00:09:44.700
children a lot here in HTML, so
yeah, you are actually spot on.

167
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.700
&gt;&gt; Yay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

168
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.950
&gt;&gt; I'm glad my goofy psychology
metaphor works [LAUGH].

169
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.350
&gt;&gt; Your psychology metaphor
works beautifully, I love it.

170
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.597
Okay, we're almost done with this.

171
00:09:54.597 --> 00:09:57.354
All right, so
the last thing to worry about here.

172
00:09:57.354 --> 00:10:00.323
Not quite the last thing, we have
the header and we have the color boxes.

173
00:10:00.323 --> 00:10:04.063
Okay, so let's take care of the header.

174
00:10:04.063 --> 00:10:07.552
Scroll up here to the header.

175
00:10:07.552 --> 00:10:09.422
So I saw a lot of you doing this.

176
00:10:09.422 --> 00:10:16.070
You're just kind of doing h1,
and you did a background,

177
00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:22.254
Color of var(--coffee).

178
00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.507
So what this does, of course,

179
00:10:24.507 --> 00:10:29.111
is it puts that brown background
color on all instances of h1.

180
00:10:29.111 --> 00:10:31.420
Not quite what we want, right?

181
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:36.438
Okay, so we can change that.

182
00:10:36.438 --> 00:10:40.093
What we really want is we want a big
brown box at the top of the page,

183
00:10:40.093 --> 00:10:42.920
which isn't necessarily all of our h1s.

184
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:47.440
So if we look at our HTML, we have
a header element here that we can use.

185
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:54.240
So let's say header instead, and
we'll give it a background color of var,

186
00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:02.507
(--coffee), okay, and

187
00:11:02.507 --> 00:11:06.722
we can give it a border.

188
00:11:06.722 --> 00:11:09.800
This is the big trick here.

189
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:15.051
Well, before I reveal that,
let's set up our header,

190
00:11:15.051 --> 00:11:18.635
h1, color is var(--vanilla).

191
00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.232
So there's that.

192
00:11:25.214 --> 00:11:30.762
Okay, so why does that work?

193
00:11:30.762 --> 00:11:36.419
&gt;&gt; That is selecting all h1s that
are children of header elements.

194
00:11:36.419 --> 00:11:40.119
&gt;&gt; Correct, all h1s that are children,
or not necessarily children,

195
00:11:40.119 --> 00:11:42.764
just descended from the header element,
right?

196
00:11:42.764 --> 00:11:45.374
Happens to be a child,
but it doesn't have to be,

197
00:11:45.374 --> 00:11:47.623
we could have it several levels in, okay?

198
00:11:47.623 --> 00:11:51.193
So that's how we set it,
that becomes vanilla,

199
00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:55.386
even though the other h1s
are still coffee, all right?

200
00:11:55.386 --> 00:12:03.360
And we can also set, Okay,
back here on my header.

201
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.460
I'm sort of working on both
of these at the same time.

202
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:09.823
Let me put in my padding top of 1rem.

203
00:12:11.965 --> 00:12:16.785
And I'm thinking I missed my header.

204
00:12:16.785 --> 00:12:18.420
Nope, I've got the header.

205
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:20.376
The margin on the bottom.

206
00:12:27.349 --> 00:12:31.160
1rem, 0, I want padding,

207
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.042
I want space on the top and the bottom.

208
00:12:36.042 --> 00:12:39.805
So let's say padding of 1rem, 0.

209
00:12:39.805 --> 00:12:46.525
And I'm gonna reset my margin bottom-left

210
00:12:46.525 --> 00:12:52.709
0 to make that a little bit even, okay?

211
00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:56.130
And then the big magic
is my border-bottom.

212
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:05.998
20px double var(--tan).

213
00:13:05.998 --> 00:13:10.722
So Dinesh said this was his big challenge,
look how easy that is.

214
00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:17.128
[LAUGH] So,
we often work with solid borders,

215
00:13:17.128 --> 00:13:23.540
sometimes we work with dotted borders.

216
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:28.210
Very occasionally you'll see dashed
borders, but double is also a value.

217
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:31.880
It's one of my favorites because
people almost never heard of it.

218
00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:35.620
And it will put in two lines,
just like this.

219
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:43.223
And I think it's a very nice way to
make your heading look there on the top.

220
00:13:43.223 --> 00:13:46.046
&gt;&gt; I had to change the HTML to do that.

221
00:13:46.046 --> 00:13:46.840
&gt;&gt; You did?

222
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:54.660
Okay, so, just the border-bottom of 20
pixels double, that'll set up that, okay.
