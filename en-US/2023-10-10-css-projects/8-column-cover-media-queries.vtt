1
00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:03.518
So now you have your mobile design, yay.

2
00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:07.316
[APPLAUSE] We're on to the next one then,

3
00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:13.139
which is the minimum width
here is 600 pixels, all right?

4
00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.455
So we need to have two
columns of information here.

5
00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:22.856
And I will get you started on this because
there have been so many questions so far.

6
00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:28.013
So what I'll say is,
to set this up, the way you're

7
00:00:28.013 --> 00:00:34.109
gonna do it is you're gonna say @media and
then min-width,

8
00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:40.991
inside of parentheses, 600px.

9
00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:46.568
Anyone wanna take a guess
at what that means?

10
00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:51.972
What does that mean, min-width: 600px?

11
00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:57.584
&gt;&gt; The size of the user's browser is
that if that's more than 600 pixels,

12
00:00:57.584 --> 00:00:59.374
then these will apply.

13
00:00:59.374 --> 00:01:02.015
&gt;&gt; 600 pixels or larger, right?

14
00:01:02.015 --> 00:01:08.171
600 pixels or larger,
apply these styles, okay?

15
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:10.771
So just to show you how this might work.

16
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:15.685
If I said body, color: red,
then what we're gonna have is when

17
00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:19.690
we get larger than 600 pixels,
we have red text.

18
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.648
And when we get smaller than 600 pixels,

19
00:01:24.648 --> 00:01:27.733
we have our default brown.

20
00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:28.821
Makes sense?

21
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:32.149
You can do it, I wouldn't recommend it.

22
00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.515
Just because you can doesn't
mean you should, okay?

23
00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:37.515
But that's how this is gonna work,
all right?

24
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:47.768
All right, so I hope you did well with
the next breakpoint along the way,

25
00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:52.621
and that you were able to set this up for
so-called tablet.

26
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:58.345
These are terms that we use kind of for
convenience purposes.

27
00:01:58.345 --> 00:02:02.443
There is actually no defined screen
size for mobile, tablet, or desktop, but

28
00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:05.379
I tend to refer to these terms
just cuz it's shorthand and

29
00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:08.764
it's easier to deal with, small,
medium, and large screens.

30
00:02:08.764 --> 00:02:12.385
So remember that as you
write your media queries,

31
00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:17.055
it is a minimum width of 600
pixels where these styles apply.

32
00:02:17.055 --> 00:02:22.043
That means that all of the other
styles that we've written before,

33
00:02:22.043 --> 00:02:24.144
everything from your base,

34
00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:29.583
everything from your mobile styles
come through to your tablet display.

35
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:31.586
These are now enhancements.

36
00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:33.369
So we enhance that level for

37
00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:37.486
mobile to make it do something
slightly different for tablet.

38
00:02:37.486 --> 00:02:39.722
So the minimum width is 600 pixels,

39
00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:42.983
and I think our last breakpoint
is around 800 pixels.

40
00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:48.741
So you may wanna try setting your screen
somewhere larger than 600, less than 800.

41
00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:56.240
So I've got mine here at about 706, you
can put yours around the same point here.

42
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.057
So the first thing that I'm going to do,
remember that in our mobile display,

43
00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:08.241
we said we had in our base,
we had our scale set to 1.25.

44
00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:12.631
Then in our mobile display,
we reset it to 1.15.

45
00:03:12.631 --> 00:03:15.488
Well, here inside of our media query,

46
00:03:15.488 --> 00:03:19.048
we're going to reset
it again back to 1.25.

47
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:24.683
So we'll reset our style
to a scale of 1.25,

48
00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:29.357
because we're now at a larger screen and

49
00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:34.594
we'd like to go back to
our larger font size.

50
00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:38.686
Okay, the next thing is
that in our tablet display,

51
00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:41.764
we had noticed that we had two columns.

52
00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:45.373
So we have one column with
the entire article in it, and

53
00:03:45.373 --> 00:03:47.969
we have one column with the image in it.

54
00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.427
How are we going to set that up?

55
00:03:51.468 --> 00:03:56.088
So the way that I went about doing this,

56
00:03:56.088 --> 00:03:59.175
as I said article, okay?

57
00:03:59.175 --> 00:04:04.215
So obviously, the article, we now have
to set this to have two columns, right?

58
00:04:04.215 --> 00:04:06.467
Do I need to say display grid here?

59
00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:08.262
&gt;&gt; No.

60
00:04:08.262 --> 00:04:10.876
&gt;&gt; Denish is shaking his head no, why not?

61
00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:13.354
&gt;&gt; Because it's already been
in the part of the route.

62
00:04:13.354 --> 00:04:15.371
&gt;&gt; It's already cleared up here, right?

63
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:17.696
So this is gonna carry through.

64
00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:22.626
The web browser's assuming you still wanna
display grid, you still want the template

65
00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:27.169
column to be a single column of 1fr,
and we're gonna have 6 rows, all right?

66
00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:36.089
So all we have to do here then is say
grid-template-columns will be 1fr 1fr.

67
00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:38.379
So two columns.

68
00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.217
Now, if you do that, what happens?

69
00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:47.988
&gt;&gt; Everything is split up into the two
columns in order of their rows.

70
00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:50.959
&gt;&gt; Correct, so
remember our rows from up here,

71
00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:54.645
we had six rows, right,
because we have six elements.

72
00:04:54.645 --> 00:04:57.585
So our h2 shows up in our first column,

73
00:04:57.585 --> 00:05:01.425
our first paragraph shows
up in our second column.

74
00:05:01.425 --> 00:05:04.795
Then I guess we have the image,
which is showing up where we told it to.

75
00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:08.011
Remember we said we wanted
it to grow from row 2 to 3.

76
00:05:08.011 --> 00:05:09.800
Well, here's where row 2 to 3 is.

77
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.661
It put itself in the first column.

78
00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:15.875
It put this paragraph over here
cuz we haven't said where it's

79
00:05:15.875 --> 00:05:19.622
supposed to display, so
it's just gonna continue on.

80
00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:22.915
Then our third paragraph shows
up over here on the left side,

81
00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:25.248
and the footer over
here on the right side.

82
00:05:25.248 --> 00:05:27.340
Does that kind of make sense?

83
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.111
The image is in an odd spot because we
already called out where we wanted it to

84
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:34.558
display up here in our mobile styles.

85
00:05:34.558 --> 00:05:36.613
We said to display in row 2 to 3.

86
00:05:36.613 --> 00:05:42.401
So it put it there, that's row 2 to 3,
and it put it in the first column.

87
00:05:46.653 --> 00:05:49.049
Kinda sorta makes sense?

88
00:05:49.049 --> 00:05:53.383
Okay, So with that knowledge,

89
00:05:53.383 --> 00:05:59.545
what do we need to do next in order to
make this look the way it should look?

90
00:06:05.284 --> 00:06:09.895
&gt;&gt; First,
the h2 should be one single column.

91
00:06:09.895 --> 00:06:11.871
&gt;&gt; The h2 needs to go all
the way across the top,

92
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:14.064
it shouldn't be in one column by itself,
right?

93
00:06:14.064 --> 00:06:15.529
So let's start with that.

94
00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.230
How are we going to fix that problem?

95
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.928
&gt;&gt; Is there an h2?

96
00:06:20.928 --> 00:06:24.630
And then you can say grid columns,
and then tell it to span from 1 to 2.

97
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.502
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so we can say article h2,
not all the h2s in the world,

98
00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:32.208
but the ones inside of the articles.

99
00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:35.574
We want our grid-column to go from what?

100
00:06:40.228 --> 00:06:45.751
So 1 to 2, 2 to 3, right?

101
00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:46.462
&gt;&gt; Also 1 to 3.

102
00:06:46.462 --> 00:06:47.922
&gt;&gt; So 1/3.

103
00:06:50.507 --> 00:06:54.239
Aha, make sense?

104
00:06:54.239 --> 00:06:57.441
Okay, how about we try the footer next?

105
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.835
So here's the footer,
it's over here in the column by itself.

106
00:07:00.835 --> 00:07:01.668
Where should it be?

107
00:07:07.723 --> 00:07:10.933
&gt;&gt; grid-column, exactly, 1/3.

108
00:07:13.122 --> 00:07:13.814
There it is.

109
00:07:15.766 --> 00:07:17.134
Make sense?

110
00:07:17.134 --> 00:07:19.836
Everybody okay so far?

111
00:07:19.836 --> 00:07:22.826
Okay, now, as for our image,

112
00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:27.771
we could tell our image to
go to our second column and

113
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:31.460
occupy all of the rows in that column.

114
00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.674
If we do that,
what will happen to our paragraphs?

115
00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:39.962
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Well,

116
00:07:39.962 --> 00:07:43.554
what happened here when we told
the image we wanted it in row 2 to 3?

117
00:07:43.554 --> 00:07:49.621
It stuck in the first column for
us, right?

118
00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:52.785
So it's possible the grid will just say,
well, you still

119
00:07:52.785 --> 00:07:56.803
have this other stuff that's here,
let me just fill in the holes for you.

120
00:07:56.803 --> 00:07:58.502
Make sense?

121
00:07:58.502 --> 00:08:02.337
So grid will just drop the paragraphs
over here in the left column in

122
00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:03.504
the correct order.

123
00:08:03.504 --> 00:08:07.376
It's kinda smart that way, all right?

124
00:08:07.376 --> 00:08:12.634
So to make that happen,
let's just start with this.

125
00:08:12.634 --> 00:08:20.290
I'm gonna say, the article, -img-wrapper,

126
00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:27.300
we will just say, grid-column: 2/3.

127
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.187
Makes sense?

128
00:08:28.187 --> 00:08:32.101
We want it to go over
here in the right column.

129
00:08:32.101 --> 00:08:36.786
And then how many rows
do we want it to occupy?

130
00:08:36.786 --> 00:08:38.239
&gt;&gt; All of them.

131
00:08:38.239 --> 00:08:40.083
&gt;&gt; Well, not the first row.

132
00:08:41.113 --> 00:08:43.688
&gt;&gt; So 2 to 6?

133
00:08:43.688 --> 00:08:47.726
&gt;&gt; 2, do we want it to go down and
cover the footer?

134
00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:48.428
&gt;&gt; 5.

135
00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:49.466
&gt;&gt; So 2/5.

136
00:08:54.392 --> 00:08:55.989
See that?

137
00:08:55.989 --> 00:08:59.978
So now we have,
there's our header occupying two columns.

138
00:08:59.978 --> 00:09:03.458
Then we have our image occupying one, and

139
00:09:03.458 --> 00:09:07.740
then we have all of our text
over in the left column.

140
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:08.785
How cool is that?

141
00:09:08.785 --> 00:09:12.858
So what we wanna do, let's just talk about
columns cuz that's an easy one to do.

142
00:09:12.858 --> 00:09:15.870
Remember we're gonna count like humans,
not like engineers.

143
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.723
So we start with one, and
we're just gonna count.

144
00:09:18.723 --> 00:09:22.590
So one would be here
before the columns start.

145
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:24.480
That is number one.

146
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.042
Number two is going to be where
that first column ends, okay?

147
00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:29.397
That's number two.

148
00:09:29.397 --> 00:09:33.903
And then number three is going to
be where the last column ends.

149
00:09:33.903 --> 00:09:38.725
In the case where we have two columns,
one to two, two to three, okay?

150
00:09:38.725 --> 00:09:45.080
Likewise with rows, that first row
starts up here, one to two, okay?

151
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:52.302
And then the second one is gonna go two to
three, unless we tell it to occupy more.

152
00:09:52.302 --> 00:09:57.950
And in this case,
we told it to go all the way down to five.

153
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:01.643
So our footer goes all
the way across the bottom.

154
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:07.755
Now, if you ever get confused along
the way, use my favorite trick, article,

155
00:10:12.488 --> 00:10:17.350
&gt; * border: 1px solid black.

156
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:19.180
&gt;&gt; You got arcticle.

157
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:19.792
&gt;&gt; arcticle.

158
00:10:19.792 --> 00:10:21.775
&gt;&gt; arcticle, thank you.

159
00:10:21.775 --> 00:10:23.590
That will do nothing, article.

160
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:24.585
There we go.

161
00:10:24.585 --> 00:10:26.630
That will put a border on everything.

162
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.880
If you can't see it, you can't style it.

163
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:34.090
Use your borders to understand
where things are along the way.

164
00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:37.753
So you can see here,
there's that h2 going all the way across.

165
00:10:37.753 --> 00:10:40.250
Obviously, here's our columns, right?

166
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.515
Here's that image spanning
all the way down these rows.

167
00:10:43.515 --> 00:10:46.380
There's the footer going across
two columns at the bottom.

168
00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.601
Makes sense?

169
00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:49.640
So this is always a very
handy thing to do.

170
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.768
You've got to put a border on it
to understand what's happening.

171
00:10:52.768 --> 00:10:56.500
Okay, so
the last part of this is the image.

172
00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:00.847
And this is super cool because
this is a new technique that

173
00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:04.571
everybody is just gonna
love because I loved it.

174
00:11:04.571 --> 00:11:08.310
And that has to do with
dealing with this image.

175
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:12.086
So right now, what's happening with
the image is that's the whole image that's

176
00:11:12.086 --> 00:11:14.287
displaying there in
that right-hand column.

177
00:11:14.287 --> 00:11:19.037
What we actually wanna do, though, in
our tablet is we wanna take part of that

178
00:11:19.037 --> 00:11:22.900
image and show it maybe
a little bit longer than it is.

179
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.126
Make sense?

180
00:11:24.126 --> 00:11:29.035
Okay, so to do that,
what we're going to do is the following,

181
00:11:29.035 --> 00:11:31.640
I'm going to put in article img.

182
00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.691
Step one is to say this,
we're gonna say our

183
00:11:37.691 --> 00:11:42.720
width is 100% and our height is 100%.

184
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.485
And this is going to do
a bad thing to your image.

185
00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:49.858
[COUGH] Why did it do this?

186
00:11:49.858 --> 00:11:54.792
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; As we said, width and

187
00:11:54.792 --> 00:11:57.689
height inherit from the container
that it's filling in.

188
00:11:57.689 --> 00:12:00.210
&gt;&gt; Correct,
it did exactly what you told it to do.

189
00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.083
It made it as wide as the column, and
it made it as tall as the column.

190
00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:08.530
So yeah, that's not really what you meant
it to do, but this is where we start.

191
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:10.997
We start with a width of 100% and
a height of 100%.

192
00:12:10.997 --> 00:12:16.251
Then we're gonna add the new
property called object-fit,

193
00:12:16.251 --> 00:12:18.730
and we're gonna say cover.

194
00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.724
And what cover does is,
it's gonna kinda zoom in.

195
00:12:23.724 --> 00:12:27.529
You can see,
there's the coffee packet there, okay?

196
00:12:27.529 --> 00:12:31.396
It's doing the best it can to
cram this image into the space.

197
00:12:31.396 --> 00:12:35.174
If you look at the original image,
you'll see that it's blurred a little bit.

198
00:12:35.174 --> 00:12:38.109
In the back there,
that's what you're looking at.

199
00:12:38.109 --> 00:12:40.979
It's gonna try to cram this
image into the space and

200
00:12:40.979 --> 00:12:45.930
just show the part of it without trying
to cram the whole image in there, right?

201
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:48.483
So we've improved a little bit.

202
00:12:48.483 --> 00:12:54.254
Then we're gonna say
object-position: 20% 50%.

203
00:12:54.254 --> 00:13:02.939
This is gonna move the image to
the part that you wanna show.

204
00:13:02.939 --> 00:13:05.928
And that really isn't the part that I
wanna show, but use those numbers for

205
00:13:05.928 --> 00:13:07.148
the moment.

206
00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:13.556
And then the last thing to do is,
here on our article-img-wrapper,

207
00:13:13.556 --> 00:13:17.370
we're gonna set the height to 600px.

208
00:13:20.138 --> 00:13:25.365
And then that will fit just that portion
of the image into that height overall,

209
00:13:25.365 --> 00:13:27.830
and that's why we put that div on it.

210
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:31.091
&gt;&gt; Can you talk a little bit
about that 20% and 50% there?

211
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:36.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the easiest way to do
this is just sort of to show you.

212
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.869
So if I said 0 0,
&gt;&gt; So

213
00:13:39.869 --> 00:13:42.502
it's a left to right percentage and
a top to bottom [INAUDIBLE]?

214
00:13:42.502 --> 00:13:44.120
&gt;&gt; And a top to bottom, yep.

215
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.201
Or if I said 0 100 %,
I could have said 100% 100%,

216
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:57.277
Then it's gonna shift over here and
show us a different part of the image.

217
00:13:57.277 --> 00:14:01.145
And through exhaustive testing,
I determined these are the right numbers.

218
00:14:01.145 --> 00:14:02.548
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; As you know in CSS,

219
00:14:02.548 --> 00:14:07.579
sometimes it's just a matter of fiddling
with numbers until you get what you want.

220
00:14:07.579 --> 00:14:10.182
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; What are the other options for

221
00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:11.700
the object-fit?

222
00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:13.898
&gt;&gt; You can say contain, and

223
00:14:13.898 --> 00:14:19.037
that will contain the entire
image in the space occupied.

224
00:14:19.037 --> 00:14:21.907
So in this case,
it's gonna contain it all, and

225
00:14:21.907 --> 00:14:25.270
it's not stretching it height-wise.

226
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:28.235
So it's kind of overrides
that height of 100%.

227
00:14:28.235 --> 00:14:32.763
And I think there's another,
maybe it's fit is another one.

228
00:14:32.763 --> 00:14:34.831
Yeah, fit does that in this case.

229
00:14:34.831 --> 00:14:40.819
So there's a couple of those, and I gave
you a link to this in your CSS projects.

230
00:14:40.819 --> 00:14:46.044
Here, if you go to the Hints/Spoilers,
I gave you links to MDN,

231
00:14:46.044 --> 00:14:50.799
where you can go read up on these and
exactly how these work.

232
00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:53.350
Okay, cover's the one that we want.

233
00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:59.227
Okay, so now the last thing here to do,

234
00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:04.797
I had a couple of other tweaks
here on this img-wrapper.

235
00:15:06.504 --> 00:15:12.401
And what I said here was
a max-width of 300 pixels.

236
00:15:12.401 --> 00:15:19.224
I don't want it to be too wide,
I don't want it going off the page.

237
00:15:19.224 --> 00:15:23.516
And I gave it some margin,
1.5rem 1.5rem 0 0.

238
00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:26.460
Remember the four numbers?

239
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.904
Top, right, bottom, left.

240
00:15:29.904 --> 00:15:32.810
TRBL, remember that and
stay out of trouble.

241
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:38.562
So we've added 1.5 rem to the top and
1.5 rem to the right.

242
00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:41.630
So that pushes it down to bring
it in line with the text.

243
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:42.970
Looks a lot cleaner.

244
00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:44.651
Pushes it over from the edge of the page,
so

245
00:15:44.651 --> 00:15:46.400
we have a little breathing
room over there.

246
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:54.737
And then the last thing we can do
is a grid-specific property for

247
00:15:54.737 --> 00:15:58.762
children, justify-self: end.

248
00:15:58.762 --> 00:16:00.075
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sorry.

249
00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:02.290
&gt;&gt; Justify yourself, yes.

250
00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.208
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yes, it's a wonderful property.

251
00:16:06.208 --> 00:16:09.200
And I'm not gonna go into a whole
lot about that property right now.

252
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.594
But if you Google for CSS-Tricks, grid,

253
00:16:12.594 --> 00:16:17.323
you will find this page, and
it will talk to you about that.

254
00:16:17.323 --> 00:16:21.070
The left side,
the left column is all about the parent,

255
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.360
so in our case, the article.

256
00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.257
The right column is all about
the individual children and

257
00:16:26.257 --> 00:16:27.893
how you can align them in place.

258
00:16:27.893 --> 00:16:33.093
So what the justify-self, so
you justify yourself here,

259
00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:36.109
is going to move your element, but

260
00:16:36.109 --> 00:16:40.900
just that element,
not all of them, around in space.

261
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.690
So that's what we did, we pushed
it over to the right a little bit.
