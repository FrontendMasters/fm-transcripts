1
00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:05.324
All of the screenshots are here
inside of the web page as usual.

2
00:00:05.324 --> 00:00:07.596
I've given you the hover states,

3
00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:11.601
how the buttons are supposed to
look on hover, and so forth.

4
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:16.112
Then the last part here, thinking
about the right semantic markup for

5
00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:19.098
this page,
there may be more than one answer.

6
00:00:19.098 --> 00:00:21.957
So give some thought to
that semantic markup and

7
00:00:21.957 --> 00:00:25.253
think about why you choose
the answer that you choose.

8
00:00:25.253 --> 00:00:28.683
And the second part that I say here is
that layouts are all about parents and

9
00:00:28.683 --> 00:00:29.246
children.

10
00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:33.797
So consider the impact of
grouping semantic elements and

11
00:00:33.797 --> 00:00:35.990
surrounding them by dibs.

12
00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.730
So how is that gonna change
the parent-child relationship?

13
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.047
We've seen that over and
over through many of these examples today.

14
00:00:43.047 --> 00:00:47.931
But this really comes into play here
on these cards where we're moving

15
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.508
a lot of elements around on the page.

16
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:54.297
So if we open this on up
to our starting cards here,

17
00:00:54.297 --> 00:00:58.811
you'll see that as usual we have
our base styles in place and

18
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:02.353
I've given you all of
the text here at the top.

19
00:01:02.353 --> 00:01:05.840
So if you don't have time to mark up
all these, the markup is all the same.

20
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.484
Our Coffee is the title of the web page.

21
00:01:08.484 --> 00:01:14.701
And then we have the title of Coffee, the
image, some blah blah, and this order now.

22
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.598
Think about how you're going
to mark that up semantically.

23
00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:26.084
All right, so
the first step is always semantic HTML.

24
00:01:26.084 --> 00:01:30.158
Let us go ahead and walk through
exactly how we put that together.

25
00:01:30.158 --> 00:01:35.383
Andrew, how am I putting together my
heading here at the top of the page?

26
00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.110
&gt;&gt; You're putting our coffee in a header.

27
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.370
&gt;&gt; Header.

28
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.540
&gt;&gt; And also in an h1.

29
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.883
&gt;&gt; And in an h1.

30
00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:45.020
&gt;&gt; And
our trusty fancy text span on coffee.

31
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.303
&gt;&gt; And the fancy text on coffee,
span class=fancy-text.

32
00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:56.999
/span.

33
00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:00.645
Oops, /h1.

34
00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:05.062
/header.

35
00:02:06.931 --> 00:02:09.339
Cool, there we go.

36
00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:14.679
Okay, now we move onto each one
of these particular items here.

37
00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.375
There were a couple of ways that
you might pick to mark this up.

38
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.810
How might you think you'd mark this up?

39
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.275
&gt;&gt; I'm throwing everything in a card
from before coffee till after order now.

40
00:02:24.275 --> 00:02:26.154
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's definitely a card.

41
00:02:26.154 --> 00:02:28.378
Yeah, absolutely, definitely a card.

42
00:02:28.378 --> 00:02:30.949
So there's a couple of ways
that you could do this.

43
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:33.835
You could think of these as figures maybe.

44
00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:38.451
I tend to not think of them as figures
because this is really about ordering

45
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:39.275
the coffee.

46
00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.311
There's an action there at the end.

47
00:02:42.311 --> 00:02:46.091
But we still need to show some kind of
relationship between all of this content.

48
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:49.514
So if you marked it up as a figure,
I'm not that mad at you.

49
00:02:49.514 --> 00:02:52.614
But the way I wound up doing it was this.

50
00:02:52.614 --> 00:03:00.845
I said a section with
a class of card container.

51
00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:05.412
So this section is gonna go around
the entire, all of the cards.

52
00:03:05.412 --> 00:03:09.979
So from the beginning all
the way down to the end.

53
00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:15.198
And then for each individual card we
are going to give this an article,

54
00:03:15.198 --> 00:03:18.831
because it feels like you
could syndicate this.

55
00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:24.124
This is a whole bunch of different kinds
of coffee that it may be out there that's

56
00:03:24.124 --> 00:03:29.900
why I chose article, but again you could
probably choose figure, or something else.

57
00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.292
Or I'll go with a class card [COUGH] and

58
00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:37.900
that article will end after
the order now button.

59
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:45.875
Okay, and as with most cards, the markup
is exactly the same, the content changes.

60
00:03:45.875 --> 00:03:51.990
All right, so coffee,
what level of heading should coffee be?

61
00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.756
&gt;&gt; H2.

62
00:03:52.756 --> 00:04:00.295
&gt;&gt; An h2, cuz we have an h1
already Then we have our image.

63
00:04:00.295 --> 00:04:03.482
We'll probably wanna put a div around it.

64
00:04:03.482 --> 00:04:07.585
In case we wanna do magic with it later,
so

65
00:04:07.585 --> 00:04:14.401
div with a class of card hyphen image,
and a slash div after the card.

66
00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:22.959
Then we have a description,
what would be the markup for this?

67
00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:23.528
&gt;&gt; P.

68
00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:28.322
&gt;&gt; Probably just a paragraph,
yeah, just a paragraph.

69
00:04:28.322 --> 00:04:30.987
And then comes the controversial part.

70
00:04:30.987 --> 00:04:33.009
What are we going to do
with this order now?

71
00:04:36.052 --> 00:04:39.535
&gt;&gt; Could be a button or link.

72
00:04:39.535 --> 00:04:42.586
&gt;&gt; There could be a button or
a link is it a button or

73
00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:45.422
is it a link that is
the ultimate question.

74
00:04:45.422 --> 00:04:49.890
And the way you answer that is what
happens when you click on the button.

75
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.983
So and there's two ways that this could be
handled in real programming situations.

76
00:04:54.983 --> 00:04:59.310
The button could be executing some kind
of script and magic is happening and

77
00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.830
all kinds of other stuff.

78
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.078
Or we could be clicking a link that is
gonna parse some stuff across the URL and

79
00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:07.640
do whatever, right?

80
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.825
So it's one of those two solutions.

81
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:13.922
If when you click the button,
there's a whole bunch of JavaScript

82
00:05:13.922 --> 00:05:17.666
that's executing,
you'll use the HTML button, button.

83
00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:23.157
If you are clicking this and it's actually
a link that is going to go do something,

84
00:05:23.157 --> 00:05:25.076
then you use the link a href.

85
00:05:25.076 --> 00:05:29.456
There is a difference between buttons and
links.

86
00:05:29.456 --> 00:05:32.624
The totally wrong answer is it's a div.

87
00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.497
Divs are not how we handle buttons.

88
00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:39.248
There it's either gonna be a link or
it's going to be a button tag.

89
00:05:39.248 --> 00:05:43.364
So in my case, I marked mine up with a,

90
00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:48.126
I put a paragraph, and
then inside of that,

91
00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:53.559
I put an a href='' # ''class="button".

92
00:05:55.855 --> 00:06:00.735
Order Now /a

93
00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:05.617
/p, okay?

94
00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:08.462
So by the time you're done,
it should look like this.

95
00:06:08.462 --> 00:06:11.103
You should have coffee smashed
up against the edge of the page.

96
00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:13.472
There's your image,
stretched all the way across.

97
00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:14.796
There's your paragraph.

98
00:06:14.796 --> 00:06:20.529
There's your order now down there
with the default link styling, okay?

99
00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:22.959
So you're gonna repeat that markup for

100
00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:26.132
all of the rest of the cards
as we go on down the page.

101
00:06:26.132 --> 00:06:28.748
Probably depends on which is easiest
to implement from the programming

102
00:06:28.748 --> 00:06:29.320
perspective.
