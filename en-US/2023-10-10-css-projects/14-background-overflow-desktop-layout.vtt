1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.521
Okay, so
let me show you the last one here.

2
00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:09.135
And the last one is for over 1,000 pixels.

3
00:00:12.922 --> 00:00:17.541
@media (mid-width: 1000px).

4
00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:30.877
Okay, and, So that is this one here.

5
00:00:30.877 --> 00:00:34.240
So now we wanna make it go like this.

6
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.663
Anyone wanna comment on that,
the difference between these two layouts?

7
00:00:40.663 --> 00:00:46.240
&gt;&gt; We have just maybe
one row to the wrapper-

8
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.011
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

9
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:48.000
&gt;&gt; Of the most horizontal one.

10
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.921
It looks like I'd say there's one row
to the wrapper, and then the secondary,

11
00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:56.239
right, half of it is separated
into two rows itself.

12
00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.612
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

13
00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:00.212
&gt;&gt; Then yeah, we have our card layouts,

14
00:01:00.212 --> 00:01:02.170
which don't need too
much change otherwise.

15
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.837
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

16
00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:06.480
&gt;&gt; It's like the first one's two
fractal units, all right, yeah.

17
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.846
&gt;&gt; Yeah, something like that.

18
00:01:07.846 --> 00:01:12.196
Yeah, so maybe this is 2fr here,

19
00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:16.699
1fr, 1fr, and we have two rows.

20
00:01:16.699 --> 00:01:20.571
And this card here spans two columns and
two rows, right?

21
00:01:20.571 --> 00:01:22.288
Yeah, something like that.

22
00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:25.768
Good, this is great, okay?

23
00:01:25.768 --> 00:01:29.028
So let's see how we wrote that.

24
00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:31.860
So what it did here was .wrapper,

25
00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.162
grid-template-columns of 2fr 1fr 1fr.

26
00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:50.502
Grid-template-rows of repeat(2, auto).

27
00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.375
Oops, and a gap of 2rem, All right?

28
00:02:01.375 --> 00:02:08.212
And then we need to
resize our card columns.

29
00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:15.718
So .card,
grid-template-columns of 50px 1fr.

30
00:02:19.694 --> 00:02:22.640
And then one is always an exception.

31
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.242
So for one, grid-row: 1/3,

32
00:02:29.242 --> 00:02:34.255
grid-column: 1/2.

33
00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:35.518
Here we go.

34
00:02:35.518 --> 00:02:39.140
And then we just have to fix
there within our own layout.

35
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.550
So here, grid-template-columns

36
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.343
will be 50px 0.75fr 1fr.

37
00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:01.348
And grid-template-rows will be 0.25fr 1fr.

38
00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.360
And that will push down our
text a little bit there.

39
00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:11.940
It's a lot, right, it's a lot.

40
00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.172
But it's amazing what you can do here and
it's amazing how much you guys are getting

41
00:03:16.172 --> 00:03:19.330
out of this even if you've just
started learning grid today.

42
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.195
You've now been coding grid for
three hours, nice.

43
00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:27.260
These are problems that
are really designed for

44
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.332
people who have been coding grid for
three years, [LAUGH] okay?

45
00:03:31.332 --> 00:03:34.248
But you're catching on to it,
you're able to look at this,

46
00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:38.208
you're able to group things into units
that we're gonna move around on the page.

47
00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:41.138
You're able to figure out
exactly how you might do

48
00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:43.877
that even if you don't
know all of the syntax.

49
00:03:43.877 --> 00:03:48.641
And the first one there, understanding
how things are moving on the page, is far

50
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:53.070
more valuable than the actual syntax,
which you can go and look up, yeah.

51
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.607
But understanding the plan and
how you're going to move and

52
00:03:56.607 --> 00:03:58.738
what where, that is the hard part.

53
00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:00.370
And you guys seem to be getting that.

54
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.783
So well done, everybody.

55
00:04:02.783 --> 00:04:06.316
Yay, questions on our coffee facts?

56
00:04:11.518 --> 00:04:13.663
&gt;&gt; I have a bunch of questions on Grid.

57
00:04:13.663 --> 00:04:18.134
I feel like we should all
check out the course on Grid.

58
00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:18.717
&gt;&gt; Don't you?

59
00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:20.194
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Wow, yes,

60
00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:22.430
that seems like a good thing to do.
