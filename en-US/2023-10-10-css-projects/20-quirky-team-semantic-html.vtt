1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.460
So we've talked about our images,
that's step one.

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.539
What's step two?

3
00:00:06.264 --> 00:00:08.160
Semantic HTML.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.101
So if you go to your website.

5
00:00:13.101 --> 00:00:14.540
Website, find the website.

6
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.324
Go down to the big red button
where it says BEGINNING CODEPEN,

7
00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:26.941
you will find here all of our people,
They're all here, I've given them to you.

8
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:29.892
I've told you, this is Michelle,
she's the owner, and

9
00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:33.850
we need to include links to Instagram,
LinkedIn, and Mastodon.

10
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.310
Up here at the top, I've given you
the SVG icon URLs that you can use.

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.761
And I would recommend just putting
these inside of image tags, okay?

12
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:50.518
And see if you can figure out
how to set up your markup

13
00:00:50.518 --> 00:00:53.733
here based on what I just told you.

14
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:57.597
Just worry about the first card, you
don't have to worry about the other ones.

15
00:00:57.597 --> 00:00:58.515
You ready?

16
00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:00.489
Go.

17
00:01:05.278 --> 00:01:11.630
Okay, so hopefully your
semantic HTML worked out okay.

18
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.970
Let's start with the Our Team
here at the top of the page.

19
00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.916
How did you mark that up?

20
00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:21.250
Or how would you mark that up?

21
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.267
&gt;&gt; Usual header situation.

22
00:01:22.267 --> 00:01:25.270
&gt;&gt; Header, yep, header.

23
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.330
Isn't it nice to have all
the styles already established?

24
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.366
Header and then inside of that,

25
00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:39.426
of course is an h1 and a /h1.

26
00:01:39.426 --> 00:01:41.890
There we go, all done.

27
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.130
Okay, then I'm just gonna
mark up this first one here.

28
00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.250
All of the rest of them
are exactly the same idea.

29
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.340
So, how did you set these up?

30
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.040
What is the first element
you put in place?

31
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.690
&gt;&gt; Figure.

32
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.800
&gt;&gt; Figure, yeah.

33
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.301
So we're gonna start with figure here.

34
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:06.121
And we're gonna end with /figure.

35
00:02:08.583 --> 00:02:11.423
/figure, okay?

36
00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:14.260
And so there's our image.

37
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.628
And then how did you mark up
all of the stuff here inside?

38
00:02:19.628 --> 00:02:22.950
The Michelle, Owner, and
the links to the various social media.

39
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.770
How did you mark that up?

40
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.676
&gt;&gt; I did a figcaption with a span around
the first name cuz it looks like there's

41
00:02:29.676 --> 00:02:32.174
a little fancy text going on later.

42
00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:32.920
&gt;&gt; Okay.

43
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.890
So we have a figcaption around and
a /figcaption to end it.

44
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.027
And then you're suggesting that
these are just spans right here for

45
00:02:43.027 --> 00:02:44.830
the name of the person?

46
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.613
&gt;&gt; That's how I did the name.

47
00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:49.222
I left the rest of it out of the span.

48
00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:50.228
&gt;&gt; Cool.

49
00:02:50.228 --> 00:02:53.310
Well, you were on the right track.

50
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.882
Yes, we need to have something around
the name but I did an h2, because again,

51
00:02:57.882 --> 00:02:59.121
we start with an h1.

52
00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:03.339
These are now individual people that
are kind of like headings on the page.

53
00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.820
You would wanna know who
all these people are.

54
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.260
Maybe learn more about
one of these people.

55
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.847
So I've done that with an h2.

56
00:03:10.847 --> 00:03:13.467
How about owner?

57
00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.326
How would we mark up the owner
&gt;&gt; With an h3?

58
00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:21.050
&gt;&gt; You could go with an h3, but
I went with just a plain old paragraph.

59
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.911
More as a generic kind of thing.

60
00:03:24.911 --> 00:03:29.286
The important part here is the name of the
person and the title is less important.

61
00:03:29.286 --> 00:03:33.759
Then we have our links to Instagram,
LinkedIn, and Mastodon.

62
00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.702
So the link is gonna go how?

63
00:03:39.166 --> 00:03:41.710
&gt;&gt; So is it gonna be an a or an image?

64
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.083
Cuz, if it's clickable it
should start with, yeah.

65
00:03:44.083 --> 00:03:47.450
So it's an a, and
then it has its target and href.

66
00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.382
But you can also have
the image source contained as

67
00:03:51.382 --> 00:03:54.350
a separate element with inside.

68
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.875
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so
you can put in whatever you want here.

69
00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:01.719
What order do I have these in?

70
00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.970
I have Instagram first.

71
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.227
So instagram.com is good enough here.

72
00:04:09.227 --> 00:04:16.421
We can say target="_blank",

73
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:21.160
okay, /a, right?

74
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.820
So those are links to these places.

75
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.205
We don't have anything to click on yet,
but we have the link.

76
00:04:27.205 --> 00:04:30.842
[LAUGH] So we have Instagram,

77
00:04:30.842 --> 00:04:36.150
we have LinkedIn, and we have Mastodon.

78
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.763
I think that's the right order, yeah.

79
00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:45.760
Okay, then inside of each of
these we need to put in our SVG.

80
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.477
And the way I've done that
is just an img src=, and

81
00:04:50.477 --> 00:04:55.540
you can copy down the assets
that I've given you here.

82
00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.539
So here's the asset for the SVG,

83
00:05:01.793 --> 00:05:05.245
alt="Instagram".

84
00:05:09.623 --> 00:05:14.526
And because it has alt text, we don't have
to worry about, screen readers will have

85
00:05:14.526 --> 00:05:18.950
those Instagram alt text and so
forth read off for each of those.

86
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.226
So I've got Instagram, I've got LinkedIn.

87
00:05:31.213 --> 00:05:36.703
Img src="blah, blah, blah.

88
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.963
Alt=, "LinkedIn".

89
00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:51.730
Okay, and then the last one is Mastodon.

90
00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:06.447
Img src=", there's that link,

91
00:06:06.447 --> 00:06:11.586
alt="Mastodon", okay,

92
00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:22.612
Great, now, you can,
if you've left it just like this for

93
00:06:22.612 --> 00:06:28.576
your semantic HTML,
that is totally fine what you have here.

94
00:06:28.576 --> 00:06:34.511
Because you have the image at the top
here, these are each a figure.

95
00:06:34.511 --> 00:06:35.917
Your image at the top,

96
00:06:35.917 --> 00:06:40.360
your figure caption which contains
the name of the person, the owner.

97
00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.435
And then a series of links.

98
00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:48.715
One of the things that I did do here for
all of these links,

99
00:06:48.715 --> 00:06:53.400
is I put a div with a class
of icons around this.

100
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.570
The reason why is, and then a /div.

101
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.480
So this is gonna go around each icon.

102
00:07:01.942 --> 00:07:08.889
So we have a div with a class of
icons before each one of these links.

103
00:07:10.522 --> 00:07:12.752
And a /div after.

104
00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:28.885
And the reason why I did that is because
ultimately we have some common styling for

105
00:07:28.885 --> 00:07:34.910
all of these icons that we will
want to do with our icons class.

106
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:39.596
Also, if you take a look
at each icon individually,

107
00:07:39.596 --> 00:07:44.600
they have that,
in this case it's a green background,

108
00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.820
and on hover, it's gonna turn blue.

109
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:53.315
We need some way of putting that
background color in there because if we

110
00:07:53.315 --> 00:07:56.754
just look at what we've got right now,
we got icons.

111
00:07:56.754 --> 00:08:01.179
They are honking big, [LAUGH] okay?

112
00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:03.527
And that is awesome,
because all we've done is the HTML, and

113
00:08:03.527 --> 00:08:05.210
that's the way they're supposed to look.

114
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.533
So we're gonna need some way of giving
them that background green color,

115
00:08:08.533 --> 00:08:11.552
and the div is gonna provide us
that opportunity to give them that.

116
00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:18.670
Okay, so this same pattern you're
gonna repeat all the way through for

117
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.700
the various other managers and so forth.

118
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.320
If you only have one link there,

119
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.227
then you'll only have one div with a class
of icons with the link inside of it.

120
00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:28.436
Sometimes you have three of them.

121
00:08:28.436 --> 00:08:30.051
Sometimes you have two of them.

122
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:31.927
Okay?

123
00:08:31.927 --> 00:08:35.370
So that is how you're gonna continue
on with those for the rest of the page
