1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
The next thing I'm gonna have you do
is I'm gonna have you code, what?

2
00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:07.319
So we talked about the layouts.

3
00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.258
We've talked about
things to watch out for.

4
00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:12.184
We've coded our semantic HTML.

5
00:00:12.184 --> 00:00:13.295
What is step three?

6
00:00:13.295 --> 00:00:14.293
&gt;&gt; Mobile first.

7
00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:16.103
&gt;&gt; Mobile first, right?

8
00:00:16.103 --> 00:00:21.058
So the next thing you're gonna work
on then is the mobile design of

9
00:00:21.058 --> 00:00:23.319
how this is supposed to look.

10
00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:27.792
So in this step,
you might wind up adding some divs or

11
00:00:27.792 --> 00:00:31.256
spans if needed to add classes, right?

12
00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:35.177
So you're gonna need to style this up,
just to work on mobile.

13
00:00:35.177 --> 00:00:37.243
That is all you need to do, make sense?

14
00:00:37.243 --> 00:00:40.887
We'll come back and we'll talk about the
answers to the mobile results, sound good?

15
00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:48.771
All right, so remember that when
we talk about mobile display,

16
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:50.704
this is our default styles.

17
00:00:50.704 --> 00:00:53.168
They are outside of media queries, so

18
00:00:53.168 --> 00:00:57.253
they're no media queries involved
when we work mobile first.

19
00:00:57.253 --> 00:00:59.967
This is what you get by default, and

20
00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:05.135
then we're gonna use media queries
as we go to larger size screens.

21
00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:09.211
So we don't need to set
up any media queries or

22
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:14.701
anything else as we put in our CSS,
we just start writing it.

23
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:20.544
So what I'm going to do here, let's start
from just to point out a couple of things

24
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:26.151
that came up here in the classroom, the
button up here at the top of the screen.

25
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:30.695
If you don't have your code on the left or
the right, whichever you prefer,

26
00:01:30.695 --> 00:01:35.239
these buttons here at the top will change
that orientation and will make this

27
00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:40.071
work much easier for you as we're working
with responsive design essentially.

28
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.575
Notice that as you grab the little
divider here and pull it to the side,

29
00:01:46.575 --> 00:01:50.645
there's a tiny number that comes
up down here on the bottom.

30
00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:55.630
That will tell you exactly how wide
this window is, the display window here.

31
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.268
And I said in the website,

32
00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:05.825
Scroll back down here,
this is less than 600 pixels.

33
00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:11.521
So what we wanna do here to set up is
have this to be less than 600 pixels.

34
00:02:11.521 --> 00:02:14.530
So I've got it at 428, whatever.

35
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.287
You've got something like that.

36
00:02:16.287 --> 00:02:19.726
So I know that once again,
I have some things I need to do.

37
00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:24.200
One of the things that happens,
if you look at the word convenience here,

38
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.812
kind of a big,
long word here in the title.

39
00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.853
As I make the screen smaller,

40
00:02:28.853 --> 00:02:33.356
I do get to a point where convenience
starts to scroll off, okay?

41
00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:37.528
So we may want to make our font
sizes a little bit smaller.

42
00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:41.164
Could just be the heading or
we could scale overall?

43
00:02:41.164 --> 00:02:45.623
And I went through this with you
earlier in our base styling.

44
00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.283
We had talked about all of
the things here for our font scale.

45
00:02:49.283 --> 00:02:53.207
One of the things that we could do
is change either our base size or

46
00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:56.784
our scale in order to reduce
the size of our fonts overall.

47
00:02:56.784 --> 00:02:59.111
So I am going to do that here.

48
00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:02.727
The very first thing I'm going to
do is declare root once again.

49
00:03:02.727 --> 00:03:07.724
And I'm going to declare
my scale to be 1.15.

50
00:03:07.724 --> 00:03:15.353
Because then everything is going
to reduce proportionately overall,

51
00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:23.501
and that word convenience doesn't
scroll off until I get to 247 pixels.

52
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:25.250
So again, is that important?

53
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.773
Do we need to go smaller, depends?

54
00:03:27.773 --> 00:03:29.587
It depends, it always depends.

55
00:03:29.587 --> 00:03:33.265
What devices are you supporting, right?

56
00:03:33.265 --> 00:03:37.110
All right, so this seems to be small
enough to me for phones and such.

57
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.779
So that's the first thing I'm going to do.

58
00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.295
Then as somebody had noticed,

59
00:03:43.295 --> 00:03:49.405
the word instant was a little bit bigger
in some spots than it was in others.

60
00:03:49.405 --> 00:03:53.324
And is it bigger here?

61
00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:57.153
&gt;&gt; It was just on the browser one.

62
00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.006
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
it's a little bit bigger on tablet and

63
00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:02.944
it's definitely bigger
here on the desktop.

64
00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:04.095
Did I make it bigger here?

65
00:04:04.095 --> 00:04:06.142
I think I made it bigger there.

66
00:04:06.142 --> 00:04:11.689
So to make the font size
bigger on fancy text,

67
00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:19.721
We can just say our font size is

68
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:24.430
var(--lg), the large size.

69
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.127
And notice that it doesn't grow
all that much here on the mobile

70
00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:30.866
device because our scale is smaller,
right?

71
00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:35.869
But it will on some of the other
sizes as they come later,

72
00:04:35.869 --> 00:04:39.819
and we can change our line height to 1.2.

73
00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.543
We'll make things a little bit,
give us a little bit more space.

74
00:04:43.543 --> 00:04:46.784
Because now the words
Instant Coffee Facts are wrapping,

75
00:04:46.784 --> 00:04:49.241
we wanna have a little
bit more space there.

76
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:53.902
Okay, now as for the article itself.

77
00:04:53.902 --> 00:05:00.124
So we have a header, right, and
we have an article in our HTML.

78
00:05:00.124 --> 00:05:03.012
That's it, we have a header,
we have an article.

79
00:05:03.012 --> 00:05:05.889
The header's already styled,
basically, with that.

80
00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:06.839
We're done.

81
00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.008
So now, all we have to do
is worry about the article.

82
00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:12.853
Inside of the article,
we have the following.

83
00:05:12.853 --> 00:05:14.438
We have an h2.

84
00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:16.149
We have a paragraph.

85
00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:19.599
We have another paragraph,
another paragraph.

86
00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:24.894
We have our image and
we have our footer, okay?

87
00:05:24.894 --> 00:05:26.216
So this is often helpful.

88
00:05:26.216 --> 00:05:28.961
If you start collapsing your HTML here,

89
00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:33.738
it starts to surface the relationships
between these HTML elements.

90
00:05:33.738 --> 00:05:39.346
And that is important because
that goes into your CSS styling.

91
00:05:39.346 --> 00:05:46.991
So some things we can do here for
styling our article, Are the following.

92
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:52.566
We can say that the padding
is something like 2rem, 1rem.

93
00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:55.904
So that will give us some space
at the top of the article,

94
00:05:55.904 --> 00:05:58.760
getting the heading off of the header,
right?

95
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.588
And it'll give us a little
bit of space side to side, so

96
00:06:01.588 --> 00:06:04.367
that we're not into the edges
of the browser window.

97
00:06:04.367 --> 00:06:09.408
We can also set a max
width of 1200 pixels.

98
00:06:09.408 --> 00:06:14.350
I usually like to do this because it
becomes possible to have lines that are so

99
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.389
long, maybe you've been on a page like
this, where you're trying to read.

100
00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:23.463
And you read and you read and you read,
and you go to the next line, and it's so

101
00:06:23.463 --> 00:06:24.680
easy to skip, right?

102
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.076
Our eyes are not designed to
read lines that are this long.

103
00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:34.435
So we wanna reduce the width of our
page overall to keep it readable, okay?

104
00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:36.949
So let's just set a max
width of 1200 pixels.

105
00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:39.420
It won't matter here at mobile sizes,
but it will later.

106
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.418
Yes, Dinesh?

107
00:06:40.418 --> 00:06:42.769
&gt;&gt; So nowadays,
you're using secondary monitors-

108
00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:43.378
&gt;&gt; Sure.

109
00:06:43.378 --> 00:06:44.597
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] large size.

110
00:06:44.597 --> 00:06:45.159
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So

111
00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.040
these will come into handy when
we use those kind of things.

112
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.359
&gt;&gt; Yes, those extra large monitors, and
you're gonna like the columns, too, for

113
00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:52.573
those extra large monitors.

114
00:06:52.573 --> 00:06:55.388
Watch those tricks coming up here.

115
00:06:55.388 --> 00:07:01.374
Okay, I wanna center this on the page,
margin of 0 auto.

116
00:07:01.374 --> 00:07:04.759
Now that I've given this
a max width of 1200 pixels,

117
00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:09.709
as we get larger than 1200 pixels, so
let me just show you what that looks like.

118
00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:13.133
Not so much relevant right now,
but it will later.

119
00:07:13.133 --> 00:07:18.890
What will happen, and my screen is
too small to show you at the moment.

120
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.849
Let's see, I zoom out a little bit.

121
00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:26.708
So you can see what happens as we
wind up with, as Dinesh was saying,

122
00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:29.959
on some of those larger screens,
if we have extra space,

123
00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:34.389
we're gonna distribute it evenly on
either side and center this on the page.

124
00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:35.996
Makes sense?

125
00:07:35.996 --> 00:07:37.268
Okay.

126
00:07:39.015 --> 00:07:40.086
We'll reset.

127
00:07:40.086 --> 00:07:41.370
Okay, great.

128
00:07:44.776 --> 00:07:48.799
And then, all right, so
now we get to the good part.

129
00:07:48.799 --> 00:07:53.687
The big question here, basically,
this is all formatted, more or

130
00:07:53.687 --> 00:07:55.935
less, except for the footer.

131
00:07:55.935 --> 00:07:58.935
And I'll just format that for
you real quick.

132
00:07:58.935 --> 00:08:03.980
In our article footer, we can just say

133
00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:09.194
our margin top will be var(--lg).

134
00:08:09.194 --> 00:08:11.605
Hey, we have a number,
let's just work with it.

135
00:08:11.605 --> 00:08:13.913
That'll give us some space there.

136
00:08:13.913 --> 00:08:21.107
And then I can say,
make my font size var(--small).

137
00:08:23.218 --> 00:08:26.838
Okay, so my citation is a little
bit smaller than everything else.

138
00:08:26.838 --> 00:08:29.961
&gt;&gt; Does it have to be article footer or
we can just give footer?

139
00:08:29.961 --> 00:08:30.826
Because here we just used [CROSSTALK].

140
00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:33.899
&gt;&gt; If you do just footer, then it will
apply to any footer on the website.

141
00:08:33.899 --> 00:08:36.342
In this case,
it makes no sense cuz it's one page.

142
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:42.593
Yeah, okay, then comes the fun part.

143
00:08:42.593 --> 00:08:47.557
So the fun part is,
the image is here in the HTML down

144
00:08:47.557 --> 00:08:52.300
at the bottom,
we wanna put it up here at the top.

145
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.375
How are we going to do that?

146
00:08:54.375 --> 00:08:56.182
There are two possible answers to this.

147
00:08:56.182 --> 00:08:58.990
Anybody wanna suggest one?

148
00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:01.940
&gt;&gt; I was trying with an order,
but it didn't work out.

149
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.177
So I don't know why.

150
00:09:03.177 --> 00:09:05.616
&gt;&gt; We will have to do
some kind of ordering.

151
00:09:05.616 --> 00:09:08.739
But in order to do an ordering,
how are we going to do that?

152
00:09:08.739 --> 00:09:09.657
&gt;&gt; Flexbox?

153
00:09:09.657 --> 00:09:11.835
&gt;&gt; You could do Flexbox or?

154
00:09:11.835 --> 00:09:14.681
&gt;&gt; I looked at the hint,
it's an object position.

155
00:09:14.681 --> 00:09:17.198
&gt;&gt; Well, that's part of it, but not yet.

156
00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:18.691
&gt;&gt; Okay, is it a grid?

157
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.654
&gt;&gt; Or grid, flexbox or grid.

158
00:09:20.654 --> 00:09:23.033
Those are our two options for
layouts these days.

159
00:09:23.033 --> 00:09:25.168
Pretty much, there are some other things.

160
00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:28.137
But generally speaking,
we're either gonna use flexbox or grid.

161
00:09:28.137 --> 00:09:33.356
Flexbox is good if we don't know
exactly how many things we have.

162
00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:36.392
We have a stream of images
coming off a database and

163
00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:40.967
we don't know if it's gonna be 20 or
200, flexbox is great for that.

164
00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:44.962
But if we haven't design,
we know exactly how it's going to work,

165
00:09:44.962 --> 00:09:46.583
you may choose to use grid.

166
00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:49.158
And grid as what I'm
gonna do a lot of today.

167
00:09:49.158 --> 00:09:52.537
So to get started with grid, the very
first thing we're gonna, and by the way,

168
00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:55.411
I'll mention, I have a whole course
that's devoted to flexbox and

169
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.044
grid right here at Frontend Masters.

170
00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:00.269
And it'll walk you through
all of this step by step.

171
00:10:00.269 --> 00:10:06.904
But in brief, what we will do is say,
display: grid.

172
00:10:06.904 --> 00:10:11.517
Flexbox and grid are all about
the relationship of parents and

173
00:10:11.517 --> 00:10:14.719
children when it comes to the HTML, okay?

174
00:10:14.719 --> 00:10:19.443
So we always have to pick which our parent
is gonna be and which are our children.

175
00:10:19.443 --> 00:10:24.198
So our article is going to be our parent,
or the grid container, in this case.

176
00:10:24.198 --> 00:10:29.219
And then that'll give us access to the h2,
the three paragraphs,

177
00:10:29.219 --> 00:10:33.639
the image and the footer,
as the children of that article.

178
00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:36.149
And we can rearrange them in space.

179
00:10:36.149 --> 00:10:41.731
What happens if I wanted to,
for God knows whatever reason,

180
00:10:41.731 --> 00:10:45.789
I wanna reorder this element right here?

181
00:10:45.789 --> 00:10:48.195
Could I do that with grid?

182
00:10:48.195 --> 00:10:52.231
If grid is all about parents and
children, could I reorder?

183
00:10:52.231 --> 00:10:55.311
&gt;&gt; We're talking about just
children as immediate children?

184
00:10:55.311 --> 00:10:56.038
&gt;&gt; Correct.

185
00:10:56.038 --> 00:10:56.743
&gt;&gt; Then no.

186
00:10:56.743 --> 00:11:02.900
&gt;&gt; No because is a grandchild of article,
yes?

187
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.419
&gt;&gt; Or a great grandchild.

188
00:11:05.419 --> 00:11:06.814
&gt;&gt; Or a great grandchild.

189
00:11:06.814 --> 00:11:12.158
Yes, correct,
great grandchild, true, right?

190
00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:15.785
So grid is not going to touch those
elements inside a footer at all.

191
00:11:15.785 --> 00:11:19.798
It's only gonna touch h2,
three paragraphs, image and footer.

192
00:11:19.798 --> 00:11:22.357
Make sense, okay?

193
00:11:22.357 --> 00:11:28.475
So for grid, then, we need to tell it
how many columns we wanna have and

194
00:11:28.475 --> 00:11:30.988
how many rows we wanna have.

195
00:11:30.988 --> 00:11:37.399
So grid template columns will tell us
how many columns do we wanna have.

196
00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.130
And how many columns do we want?

197
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:44.283
One column,
one column here at mobile design.

198
00:11:44.283 --> 00:11:48.141
So then, we can tell it how wide
we want that column to be, and

199
00:11:48.141 --> 00:11:49.588
I am going to say 1fr.

200
00:11:49.588 --> 00:11:54.212
fr is a unit unique to the grid.

201
00:11:54.212 --> 00:11:55.729
You will not encounter it anywhere else.

202
00:11:55.729 --> 00:11:59.253
It doesn't work anywhere
else except inside of grid.

203
00:11:59.253 --> 00:12:00.859
And fr stands for?

204
00:12:00.859 --> 00:12:02.574
&gt;&gt; Fractal, something.

205
00:12:02.574 --> 00:12:05.792
&gt;&gt; Fractals, the French,
the something, right?

206
00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:10.281
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It's a fraction.

207
00:12:10.281 --> 00:12:12.121
One fraction of the page.

208
00:12:12.121 --> 00:12:15.067
Well, how many fractions
do we have on this page?

209
00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:15.603
&gt;&gt; One.

210
00:12:15.603 --> 00:12:16.916
&gt;&gt; However many you want.

211
00:12:16.916 --> 00:12:19.008
In this case,
we're gonna say there's one and

212
00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:21.691
this column is gonna occupy that
whole fraction of the page.

213
00:12:23.236 --> 00:12:29.875
Could I have just said something
like 100 fr or 1,000 fr?

214
00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:32.926
[COUGH] Sure, one column.

215
00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:38.463
Now it's 1,000 fractions wide,
makes sense?

216
00:12:38.463 --> 00:12:42.340
Okay, we'll keep it simple though,
we'll just call it 1.

217
00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:49.661
We're also gonna tell it how many rows
we're gonna have, grid-template-rows.

218
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:51.325
How many rows do we have?

219
00:12:54.858 --> 00:12:55.870
&gt;&gt; Six.

220
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:59.689
&gt;&gt; Six, how did you get six, Andrew?

221
00:12:59.689 --> 00:13:02.600
&gt;&gt; You counted the HTML elements earlier?

222
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.503
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

223
00:13:03.503 --> 00:13:04.876
&gt;&gt; The h2, three p's.

224
00:13:04.876 --> 00:13:07.201
&gt;&gt; One, two, three, four, five, six.

225
00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:08.238
There's six elements.

226
00:13:08.238 --> 00:13:10.566
There's six children, so we want six rows.

227
00:13:10.566 --> 00:13:16.510
And the way we can write that is we
could write it the same thing six times.

228
00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:21.762
Or we could say as
a different shorthand here,

229
00:13:21.762 --> 00:13:24.462
repeat(6, auto).

230
00:13:27.587 --> 00:13:32.913
And auto, of course, is the height
of the rows, automatic, whatever.

231
00:13:32.913 --> 00:13:35.144
We want it to be as high as the column.

232
00:13:35.144 --> 00:13:38.784
All right, So, yep?

233
00:13:38.784 --> 00:13:41.514
&gt;&gt; Sorry,
what would the longhand be of that?

234
00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:43.011
&gt;&gt; The long version?

235
00:13:43.011 --> 00:13:45.022
Yeah, what would it look like?

236
00:13:45.022 --> 00:13:50.592
auto, auto, auto, auto, auto, auto.

237
00:13:50.592 --> 00:13:55.783
Totally legit, you can do that, okay?

238
00:13:55.783 --> 00:13:58.058
But that's what you would have, otherwise.

239
00:13:58.058 --> 00:13:59.666
All right, good question.

240
00:13:59.666 --> 00:14:04.511
Okay, so as for this image here,
one of the things that I'm going to

241
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:08.003
do to this image is I'm
gonna put a div around it.

242
00:14:08.003 --> 00:14:14.184
And the reason I'm doing this will
become clear a little bit later,

243
00:14:14.184 --> 00:14:19.294
but I'm gonna give this a div
with a class of article-,

244
00:14:21.016 --> 00:14:24.443
img-wrapper.

245
00:14:26.472 --> 00:14:33.133
And this has to do with how the image
is going to resize as we go forward.

246
00:14:33.133 --> 00:14:37.764
So I'm just gonna add it here and
just say magic is coming.

247
00:14:37.764 --> 00:14:42.035
Technically with what we have done so
far, you don't need this div, but

248
00:14:42.035 --> 00:14:44.215
we will when we get to later layouts.

249
00:14:44.215 --> 00:14:46.055
And since I wrapped it around the image,

250
00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:48.932
this is just taking the place of
the image by itself in that row.

251
00:14:48.932 --> 00:14:50.265
Make sense?

252
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:55.489
Okay, so
now what I'm going to do then is I'm

253
00:14:55.489 --> 00:15:00.170
gonna call my article-img-wrapper.

254
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.592
And now what I need to do is specify
where I would like that image to display.

255
00:15:04.592 --> 00:15:06.609
So if we count these rows,

256
00:15:06.609 --> 00:15:12.040
you can think of these as having
lines that go across the page, right?

257
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.875
Our heading here goes from one to two,
make sense?

258
00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:20.591
We count like humans,
we don't count like engineers.

259
00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:22.833
We don't start with zero,
we start with one.

260
00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:28.322
One to two, and then our next one
goes from two to three, right?

261
00:15:28.322 --> 00:15:30.150
Our next one goes from what?

262
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.245
Three to four.

263
00:15:32.245 --> 00:15:35.850
The next one goes from four to five,
all right?

264
00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:38.368
So right now,
our image is from five to six.

265
00:15:38.368 --> 00:15:40.069
Where do we want it?

266
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:42.578
We want it from two to three.

267
00:15:42.578 --> 00:15:48.537
So we're going to say grid-row: 2/3.

268
00:15:48.537 --> 00:15:53.299
And that will move your image up right
on up there to the top of the page.

269
00:15:53.299 --> 00:15:56.300
[SOUND] I saw that.

270
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.884
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; What's the difference if I just put

271
00:16:00.884 --> 00:16:04.176
in a 2, it goes where I expect as well?

272
00:16:04.176 --> 00:16:06.403
&gt;&gt; Basically, if you just say 2,

273
00:16:06.403 --> 00:16:10.480
it's going to assume that
it's gonna go from 2 to 3.

274
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.032
&gt;&gt; Cuz there's another property where you
could specify how many rows it takes.

275
00:16:15.032 --> 00:16:19.744
&gt;&gt; Correct, so I could say,
I actually want it to go 2 to 4.

276
00:16:19.744 --> 00:16:23.257
And in the design that we have,
it will not look different.

277
00:16:23.257 --> 00:16:25.609
It'll just make an extra row for
the last item.

278
00:16:25.609 --> 00:16:28.803
I don't wanna get into that
level of complication.

279
00:16:28.803 --> 00:16:32.590
But by always specifying the first
number and the last number,

280
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.097
you'll never be wrong.

281
00:16:34.097 --> 00:16:37.087
So that's why we do it this way.

282
00:16:37.087 --> 00:16:38.368
Yes, Mark?

283
00:16:38.368 --> 00:16:40.033
&gt;&gt; There's a couple of questions online.

284
00:16:40.033 --> 00:16:41.326
&gt;&gt; Great, love it.

285
00:16:41.326 --> 00:16:47.069
&gt;&gt; Instead of the auto,
can we write 1fr six times?

286
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:50.598
&gt;&gt; You could, let's try that.

287
00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:53.562
What do you think will happen?

288
00:16:53.562 --> 00:16:55.507
Anybody wanna take a guess?

289
00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:03.499
&gt;&gt; Force each child to be the same size?

290
00:17:03.499 --> 00:17:04.776
&gt;&gt; Hm.

291
00:17:04.776 --> 00:17:07.298
&gt;&gt; That's what I would think, yeah.

292
00:17:07.298 --> 00:17:09.715
&gt;&gt; One, two, three, four, five, six.

293
00:17:09.715 --> 00:17:11.204
&gt;&gt; So they all size to the largest one?

294
00:17:11.204 --> 00:17:15.253
&gt;&gt; They all size to the largest one,
see that?

295
00:17:15.253 --> 00:17:17.348
That's probably not what you want.

296
00:17:17.348 --> 00:17:18.942
&gt;&gt; Okay.

297
00:17:18.942 --> 00:17:21.849
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, so
they're all sizing to the largest one.

298
00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.069
So when we say auto,
it's just gonna size to the content.

299
00:17:26.374 --> 00:17:29.310
Now I'm gonna rewrite it this way,
6, auto.

300
00:17:31.423 --> 00:17:32.201
Yes?

301
00:17:32.201 --> 00:17:36.223
&gt;&gt; Could you use figure instead of div?

302
00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:39.944
&gt;&gt; You could use figure instead of div,
that would be absolutely fine.

303
00:17:39.944 --> 00:17:42.414
You don't have to have the figure caption.

304
00:17:42.414 --> 00:17:46.677
The image is moving around in the design.

305
00:17:46.677 --> 00:17:50.088
So yes, figure would be
absolutely fine instead of div.

306
00:17:50.088 --> 00:17:53.051
Great suggestion, other questions?

307
00:17:53.051 --> 00:17:55.505
&gt;&gt; I missed, sorry.

308
00:17:55.505 --> 00:17:59.452
I missed the explanation about
dynamically setting the rows,

309
00:17:59.452 --> 00:18:01.470
is that not possible with grid?

310
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.954
&gt;&gt; Dynamic, like we don't know
how many rows we're gonna have?

311
00:18:04.954 --> 00:18:09.812
Grid is smart enough that if
we've called for six things,

312
00:18:09.812 --> 00:18:14.588
if we had 25 things,
grid would continue to make rows.

313
00:18:14.588 --> 00:18:16.237
It will just continue to make them.

314
00:18:16.237 --> 00:18:19.244
Even though we've
specifically specified 6,

315
00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:23.070
it will make 25 rows of auto
height in this particular case.
