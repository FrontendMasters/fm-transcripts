1
00:00:00.314 --> 00:00:02.772
All right, so
let me swap these back again.

2
00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:07.570
Put my image wrapper
before number five here,

3
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.270
so that I get the effect that I want.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.874
Okay, you ready for the crazy one, then?

5
00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:16.596
My goodness.

6
00:00:16.596 --> 00:00:19.225
Okay, so
let's talk about this crazy one here.

7
00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:24.392
[COUGH]
And to do this one, if you

8
00:00:24.392 --> 00:00:29.679
go into your CodePen collection, probably
this is the easiest way to do this.

9
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.665
Go into your CodePen collection, and

10
00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.997
then let's click on 3D Begin,
Wacky Grid-larger breakpoints.

11
00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:41.114
And let's look at that here for a moment.

12
00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:46.198
So, this one has the additional
HTML in here that you won't

13
00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:50.987
have otherwise on the CodePen
that you're working in.

14
00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:53.655
So, I have here a configuration grid with

15
00:00:53.655 --> 00:00:57.402
configuration cells with all
the numbers in them, okay?

16
00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.126
There it is, one to 24.

17
00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:05.751
And then, I have the markup that
you've been working with so far.

18
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:10.822
Inside of our CSS, so
if you start from this one here,

19
00:01:10.822 --> 00:01:14.225
what we have going on is as follows.

20
00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:17.234
We have that bit of HTML
at the top of the screen,

21
00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:21.160
which you won't have if you're
not using this specific pen.

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.014
And you see that we have all of our
little boxes that make this up.

23
00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:30.731
So what I would recommend
that you do is as you look at

24
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:35.120
the design here, and
you look at these images,

25
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.303
figure out how wide each image
is in terms of its column.

26
00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:42.597
So let's look at this coffee cup here.

27
00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:47.114
This first one, you can see that
it's going to go between what?

28
00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:48.277
What are our numbers?

29
00:01:48.277 --> 00:01:49.593
&gt;&gt; 1 to 3.

30
00:01:49.593 --> 00:01:51.840
&gt;&gt; 1 to 3.

31
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.111
1 to 2.

32
00:01:53.111 --> 00:01:55.649
2 to 3.

33
00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.573
&gt;&gt; And 4.
&gt;&gt; 3 to 4, right?

34
00:01:57.573 --> 00:01:59.039
So 1 slash 4.

35
00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:02.890
So if you can figure out
the widths of all these images,

36
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.340
and the H1 here in the middle,
that's a great place to start.

37
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.178
If you can kinda guess at the rows here,
and see if you can figure out how

38
00:02:12.178 --> 00:02:16.120
many rows we actually have going on,
that is not as easy.

39
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.343
If you have the capacity to
take this image and draw on it,

40
00:02:19.343 --> 00:02:22.516
that'll help you figure out
how many rows we have here.

41
00:02:22.516 --> 00:02:25.690
And then you can start figuring
out exactly where every image and

42
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.763
the H1 should be placed here on the page.

43
00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:28.794
Makes sense?

44
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:37.090
Even before you write your code
to figure out what the plan is,

45
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.714
the configuration grid is really helpful.

46
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.602
All right, so the trick to getting
this layout to work is, first of all,

47
00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:55.555
you need to make sure that your
actual wrapper here with the images

48
00:02:55.555 --> 00:03:00.258
inside of it matches your
configuration grid here on the top.

49
00:03:00.258 --> 00:03:05.026
So, as I said here in the comment,
what styles do you need to carry to

50
00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:09.225
this media query to ensure
the same alignment of those two?

51
00:03:09.225 --> 00:03:14.131
So, if we take a look at
the configuration grid here,

52
00:03:14.131 --> 00:03:18.175
it has a display grid, it has 12 columns.

53
00:03:18.175 --> 00:03:22.762
It has certain padding, it has a gap,
it has a max-width, it has a margin,

54
00:03:22.762 --> 00:03:23.997
and it has a border.

55
00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:27.435
We probably need all of that, don't we?

56
00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:28.618
We're gonna need all of that.

57
00:03:28.618 --> 00:03:32.725
So if we copy that, and
we put it down here and

58
00:03:32.725 --> 00:03:38.164
change it from a class of config
grid to a class of wrapper,

59
00:03:38.164 --> 00:03:42.174
that's going to take care of most of this.

60
00:03:42.174 --> 00:03:43.428
And don't panic.

61
00:03:43.428 --> 00:03:47.951
[LAUGH] It's doing exactly
what you told it to do.

62
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.154
It's lining up these with our
first couple of columns, right?

63
00:03:51.154 --> 00:03:54.219
Our tablet layout only
had two columns in it.

64
00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.565
So it's crammed all of our content
into the two columns here.

65
00:03:58.565 --> 00:03:59.786
Never panic.

66
00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:02.897
Always look for a reason, okay?

67
00:04:02.897 --> 00:04:05.231
So that's just fine.

68
00:04:05.231 --> 00:04:10.817
And then, what we're going to wanna do

69
00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:17.940
is use my favorite trick again,
.wrapper &gt; *.

70
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.745
So the direct children of the wrapper,

71
00:04:21.745 --> 00:04:26.947
let's put on a border: 2
px solid var{vanilla}.

72
00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:29.974
That really shows us where
the edges of things are.

73
00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:32.127
Because this h1 is a little bit big,

74
00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:35.541
it's actually hanging outside
of its wrapper right now.

75
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:39.557
Because, of course, the words are longer
than the width of its wrapper.

76
00:04:39.557 --> 00:04:43.028
But we've got the rest of these,
they're doing okay.

77
00:04:43.028 --> 00:04:48.115
Okay, so one of the first
problems that we're going to

78
00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:53.754
have here is these images
still have that width of 100%,

79
00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:58.413
height of 100%, and
the object fit in place.

80
00:04:58.413 --> 00:05:03.144
[COUGH] To cram them into that
particular little bit of space.

81
00:05:03.144 --> 00:05:08.739
And what we're gonna want when we
go to our finished version of this,

82
00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:13.369
we want those images to be
the widths that they are in those

83
00:05:13.369 --> 00:05:17.337
particular places,
not cut to a specific size.

84
00:05:17.337 --> 00:05:20.195
We just want them to occupy the rows and
columns that are there.

85
00:05:20.195 --> 00:05:23.270
Okay, so in order to do that,

86
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.562
what we'll need to do is
go to our .img-wrapper.

87
00:05:28.562 --> 00:05:32.680
And we're going to set our width: auto,

88
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.631
our height: auto, and object-fit: contain.

89
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:41.146
So as you can see by doing that,

90
00:05:41.146 --> 00:05:46.701
we are basically turning
off what we had before.

91
00:05:46.701 --> 00:05:48.187
Make sense?

92
00:05:48.187 --> 00:05:53.034
We're turning off the concept of these
things occupying all the same space.

93
00:05:53.034 --> 00:05:57.975
Now, that is the entire coffee cup image
crammed into one row and one column.

94
00:05:57.975 --> 00:06:03.548
[LAUGH] Not what we want, but
we continue to get closer, right?

95
00:06:03.548 --> 00:06:11.137
Okay, here's our croissant spanning two
columns, probably one row again here.

96
00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:15.530
This is in one row, we didn't mess
with our rows in our previous design.

97
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.963
So this is giving us some hints about
where the rows are here exactly

98
00:06:18.963 --> 00:06:20.019
inside of our grid.

99
00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:21.499
Make sense?

100
00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:26.170
Okay, so all that's left now is counting.

101
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.115
Really, that's all we've got left to do.

102
00:06:28.115 --> 00:06:31.628
We have .one, right?

103
00:06:31.628 --> 00:06:38.062
And it has a grid-column and

104
00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:41.283
a grid-row.

105
00:06:41.283 --> 00:06:44.485
Then, we can just copy that and
say we have.

106
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:52.832
We have .two, .three,

107
00:06:56.127 --> 00:07:01.684
.four, and .five.

108
00:07:01.684 --> 00:07:02.882
So it's pretty much it.

109
00:07:02.882 --> 00:07:06.671
All we have to do now is
specify where exactly we

110
00:07:06.671 --> 00:07:09.401
want those images to go in space.

111
00:07:09.401 --> 00:07:10.922
It's not so terrible, is it?

112
00:07:10.922 --> 00:07:13.226
&gt;&gt; Also the h1.

113
00:07:13.226 --> 00:07:15.965
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the h1 right, and our h1.

114
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.754
&gt;&gt; Don't we also still need to
figure out how many rows there are?

115
00:07:25.754 --> 00:07:29.226
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we can count up all those rows.

116
00:07:29.226 --> 00:07:30.488
What did you guys come up with?

117
00:07:30.488 --> 00:07:32.615
Four rows.

118
00:07:32.615 --> 00:07:35.854
&gt;&gt; I thought it was maybe 16,
but I feel wrong about that.

119
00:07:35.854 --> 00:07:38.461
&gt;&gt; You thought maybe 16, but
you feel wrong about that.

120
00:07:38.461 --> 00:07:41.164
Okay, anybody else have a guess?

121
00:07:43.706 --> 00:07:47.491
Okay, well, remember the rows
are gonna vary in their heights.

122
00:07:47.491 --> 00:07:52.713
So we have probably one row
here with the coffee cup.

123
00:07:52.713 --> 00:07:56.003
We have a second row here, right?

124
00:07:58.173 --> 00:08:01.437
&gt;&gt; They vary in height, so
it's just each individual distinction-

125
00:08:01.437 --> 00:08:02.495
&gt;&gt; Pretty much.

126
00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:04.232
&gt;&gt; Third is that gap.

127
00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:06.933
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that gap lines up
with the top of our each one.

128
00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:08.728
So that winds up being our third row here.

129
00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:09.509
&gt;&gt; Okay.

130
00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:11.628
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The gap on the right is four.

131
00:08:11.628 --> 00:08:14.156
&gt;&gt; Yeah, something going on here.

132
00:08:14.156 --> 00:08:15.368
&gt;&gt; And then-
&gt;&gt; And then,

133
00:08:15.368 --> 00:08:16.979
we might have a long way to go.

134
00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:19.379
&gt;&gt; Well-
&gt;&gt; Before we get here to five.

135
00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:21.509
&gt;&gt; The make time for
coffee, doesn't that end?

136
00:08:21.509 --> 00:08:23.076
And that requires a six?

137
00:08:23.076 --> 00:08:26.265
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it is may be multiple rows,
or it might be one row, right?

138
00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:36.390
So this is probably spanning

139
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.153
from 1, 2, 3 rows here.

140
00:08:41.153 --> 00:08:42.783
This might be a fourth row, and

141
00:08:42.783 --> 00:08:45.620
then this image down here by
itself is a row by itself.

142
00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:48.874
Okay?

143
00:08:48.874 --> 00:08:50.839
So it is total craziness.

144
00:08:50.839 --> 00:08:53.511
It is total craziness, and that's okay.

145
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:56.520
This is again one of those things
in CSS where you can continue

146
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.654
to massage the numbers until
you get something close, right?

147
00:08:59.654 --> 00:09:04.141
But the widths should be easier
to guess at what these are.

148
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:08.578
All right, so I'll give you,
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, this is super important,

149
00:09:08.578 --> 00:09:09.681
can you explain that again?

150
00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:12.538
I was convinced each change there,
essentially,

151
00:09:12.538 --> 00:09:15.068
each vertical change requires another row.

152
00:09:15.068 --> 00:09:18.302
So I counted up to eight then, but
it sounds like you're saying it's five.

153
00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:21.814
&gt;&gt; Let me look at my numbers.

154
00:09:21.814 --> 00:09:24.058
The biggest number I have is eight.

155
00:09:24.058 --> 00:09:27.019
Yes, so I think you've got it right.

156
00:09:27.019 --> 00:09:29.106
Yeah, so I think we've got eight rows.

157
00:09:30.527 --> 00:09:35.781
Okay, so let's put in some numbers,
then, we'll start with one.

158
00:09:35.781 --> 00:09:39.457
So did anybody figure out, or
should I just give you numbers?

159
00:09:42.464 --> 00:09:43.424
Okay, fine.

160
00:09:43.424 --> 00:09:45.025
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; You're tired,

161
00:09:45.025 --> 00:09:47.676
I'll just give you numbers, 3/7.

162
00:09:47.676 --> 00:09:54.135
And 7/8 will be image number one.

163
00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:58.547
And so there it is, there's
the macchiato down here at the bottom.

164
00:09:58.547 --> 00:10:04.100
Image number two

165
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:11.243
is 1/4, 1/4.

166
00:10:11.243 --> 00:10:14.684
Okay, and that is our coffee cup.

167
00:10:14.684 --> 00:10:17.859
And again, don't panic,
it's all going to get clear.

168
00:10:17.859 --> 00:10:25.376
[LAUGH] [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; For two, I had 1/4, 1/4.

169
00:10:25.376 --> 00:10:26.703
Let me put in all my numbers first.

170
00:10:26.703 --> 00:10:28.613
&gt;&gt; No, don't listen to me.

171
00:10:28.613 --> 00:10:29.588
You're right, carry on.

172
00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:32.593
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's see what happens.

173
00:10:32.593 --> 00:10:34.701
Sometimes these things
depend on each other.

174
00:10:34.701 --> 00:10:40.847
So we just sort of put in some numbers,
10/13, 2/5.

175
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:50.463
And 9/12, 5/7,

176
00:10:50.463 --> 00:10:57.009
and then back for our h1.

177
00:10:57.009 --> 00:11:04.066
Okay, 5/9, and 1/7.

178
00:11:04.066 --> 00:11:08.544
Now this one, I did a little
bit more tweaking on it, okay?

179
00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:12.404
So notice how when I put the last one
in place everything snapped into place?

180
00:11:12.404 --> 00:11:17.725
Everything is kinda dependent
on each other here in this grid.

181
00:11:17.725 --> 00:11:19.503
So a couple of other things with this h1.

182
00:11:19.503 --> 00:11:23.785
Notice the big chunk of space that I
have here at the bottom, what is that?

183
00:11:23.785 --> 00:11:25.110
Where is that coming from?

184
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:29.854
Probably not a row, so what is it?

185
00:11:29.854 --> 00:11:32.280
&gt;&gt; Probably buttom padding?

186
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.993
&gt;&gt; We had some margin on those.

187
00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:39.473
We had some margin on those, so, well,
or we had padding on them, right?

188
00:11:39.473 --> 00:11:45.750
So I have padding of 0, and
I have margin of 0 auto,

189
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:50.760
to try to align it here
inside of the cell.

190
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:58.672
And I also did a max-width of 400 px.

191
00:11:58.672 --> 00:12:05.040
And I also did a font-size: var{--lg}.

192
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.430
And not all these styles apply to
exactly the screen dimension because,

193
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.519
remember, as we make the screen bigger,

194
00:12:13.519 --> 00:12:18.498
we wanted this thing to do so
other things here in space?

195
00:12:18.498 --> 00:12:25.997
And align itself, align-self: center.

196
00:12:25.997 --> 00:12:33.526
So that will make it large, there we go.

197
00:12:33.526 --> 00:12:40.635
Okay, so now as I make this bigger, see
how that stays right there in the center?

198
00:12:40.635 --> 00:12:43.614
That's the align-self property
there from grid working.

199
00:12:47.543 --> 00:12:51.079
And that is, [LAUGH] that was
the configuration grid disappearing,

200
00:12:51.079 --> 00:12:52.263
going back to tablet.
