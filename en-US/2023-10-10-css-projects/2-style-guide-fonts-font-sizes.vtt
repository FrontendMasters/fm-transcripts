00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.883
So here's where we're gonna start.

2
00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:07.522
Let us start with setting up
everything generically, and

3
00:00:07.522 --> 00:00:11.222
then we're going to
override things as we go.

4
00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:14.707
The big C and CSS stands for what?

5
00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:15.394
&gt;&gt; Cascading.

6
00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:20.741
&gt;&gt; Cascading, it's the part that we
always forget to leverage as part of CSS.

7
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:25.247
We're so busy applying classes all over
everything that we forget that there is

8
00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:27.600
a huge cascade here
that makes our lives so

9
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.101
much easier when we leverage it correctly.

10
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.495
And that is the big reason that we
start with a style guide like this.

11
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:38.376
So I am going to start here
with my first element.

12
00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:42.520
Now, remember that code pen
doesn't show you a body tag, but

13
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.685
the body tag is totally a thing.

14
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:49.811
And that is what I'm going to use
to set up my default styling here.

15
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.493
So I can say, for example,

16
00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:57.636
my font-family is going to
be the variable of sans.

17
00:00:57.636 --> 00:01:02.042
Now, some of you did not
understand what a CSS variable is.

18
00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:05.291
I'm sure you're familiar with
the concept of JavaScript variables.

19
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:08.843
Just to quick tell you
about the CSS variables.

20
00:01:08.843 --> 00:01:14.312
CSS is a series of properties and values,
and so we can't start with const,

21
00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:20.479
or let, or var, or any of the other things
that we do in other programming languages.

22
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:21.659
We have to start with a property.

23
00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.773
In this case,
we start with the pseudoclass of root,

24
00:01:24.773 --> 00:01:27.971
which sets up these as
essentially global variables.

25
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:31.790
They're accessible to us
anywhere within the document.

26
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.270
And we declare our variable
with the double dash.

27
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.121
You can call it whatever you want,
and then you assign it a value.

28
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:45.021
So there's no kind of white
happens to be looking for a color.

29
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:49.329
I could say that white was 3rem,
and CSS would be totally happy.

30
00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.193
[LAUGH] You might not be,
but CSS would be just fine.

31
00:01:53.193 --> 00:01:58.488
You can call these whatever you want, and
then you can call them later by setting

32
00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:03.487
up your property and you're gonna call
it with var, cuz it's a variable.

33
00:02:03.487 --> 00:02:07.370
And in parentheses, you put the name of
the variable that you're calling, okay?

34
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.319
So just by doing that,
the page immediately looks better.

35
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.702
We can set a line height, Of 1.5.

36
00:02:17.702 --> 00:02:21.610
Notice that there are no
units associated with 1.5.

37
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.649
You can have units on line height.

38
00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.875
I choose not to,
because then it's a ratio.

39
00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:30.853
So whatever size we're working with,
one and

40
00:02:30.853 --> 00:02:36.161
a half times of that will be
the spacing between lines, okay?

41
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:42.374
So if it's a 24 pixel font, multiply it by
1.5, that is the spacing between lines.

42
00:02:42.374 --> 00:02:47.350
So I recommend that you always use line
height without a unit associated with it.

43
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.410
When you put a unit on it and somebody
happens to blow the screen up with

44
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.036
accessibility, they want a bigger font,
then those lines start to overlap.

45
00:02:56.036 --> 00:02:57.360
We don't want that to happen.

46
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.091
So with a ratio, it doesn't happen.

47
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:07.878
Okay, we're gonna have
a background-color for

48
00:03:07.878 --> 00:03:12.895
our page, and that will be vanilla.

49
00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:16.583
So that will make the whole page vanilla.

50
00:03:16.583 --> 00:03:22.823
And then we're going to give it a color,
that's our text color, is coffee.

51
00:03:26.993 --> 00:03:33.159
And we can also set a font size,
I'm gonna do that momentarily.

52
00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.626
But one of the things that
you might have noticed,

53
00:03:35.626 --> 00:03:37.755
because Ben was talking about it earlier.

54
00:03:37.755 --> 00:03:40.798
He pointed out that those
headings have no space,

55
00:03:40.798 --> 00:03:43.918
that they are smashed
against the edge of the page.

56
00:03:43.918 --> 00:03:46.290
Notice that, though we have space,

57
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.744
a little bit of space all
the way around the document.

58
00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:54.400
So one of the things that people forget
is that your body element has by

59
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.350
default from the browser some
margin associated with it.

60
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.644
It's usually margin, it might be
padding depending on your browser.

61
00:04:01.644 --> 00:04:07.869
So I'm going to say margin of 0, and
that will smash everything to the side.

62
00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:13.215
You can also say padding: 0 for good
measure if you'd like to do that, okay?

63
00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:17.556
&gt;&gt; Is it for a general practice that
we start with always 0 in the body?

64
00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:21.425
&gt;&gt; I think it's a great practice,
because you can always add it later.

65
00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:25.005
Yeah, you can re-add it later,
so let's just turn it off.

66
00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:27.477
All right, so with that in place, and

67
00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:30.894
we have sort of a general
way that this page can look.

68
00:04:30.894 --> 00:04:37.315
Let's go back up here into our variables
and let's take a look at our font scale.

69
00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:42.216
So I have talked about font scales
before in previous courses,

70
00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:45.455
and I'm going to set you up one right now.

71
00:04:48.998 --> 00:04:54.826
So I am going to set h6 is the variable

72
00:04:54.826 --> 00:04:58.962
I'm gonna call this, and

73
00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:05.166
I'm gonna say that this is our variable

74
00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:10.249
size of our base-size, okay?

75
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:14.801
Big deal, base-size,
we already had set to 1.2 rem, so

76
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:17.670
our h6 is gonna be 1.2 rem in size.

77
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.107
Mark, you have a question?

78
00:05:19.107 --> 00:05:23.934
&gt;&gt; Aubrey is asking, should you turn
off all the default margins and

79
00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.932
paddings in the CSS with that star rule?

80
00:05:26.932 --> 00:05:30.770
&gt;&gt; You can turn off all the padding and
margins in the CSS if you wish.

81
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.503
So that will turn everything off, and then
you have to go back and reset everything.

82
00:05:34.503 --> 00:05:38.023
So even things where you want to have
padding and margin like on paragraphs,

83
00:05:38.023 --> 00:05:41.598
you probably don't want your paragraphs
all smashed up against each other,

84
00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:43.469
then you would need to go back and add it.

85
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.022
So that's really
a stylistic kind of thing.

86
00:05:46.022 --> 00:05:50.137
I generally work with the margin and
padding that the browser gives me,

87
00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:53.648
except where I don't want it,
and then I tend to zero it out.

88
00:05:53.648 --> 00:05:57.506
But you can take whichever approach that
makes sense to you, it's absolutely fine.

89
00:05:57.506 --> 00:06:04.847
Okay, so what we do for our font scale
then is we are gonna do some math.

90
00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:07.901
And so for my h5,
we're gonna do a calculation.

91
00:06:07.901 --> 00:06:13.111
So remember, calc,
is the way that we do calculations in CSS.

92
00:06:13.111 --> 00:06:17.215
Calc is limited to addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division.

93
00:06:17.215 --> 00:06:18.882
That's it, that's all it does.

94
00:06:18.882 --> 00:06:23.451
No exponents, which would make our life
much easier when doing a font scale,

95
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:24.515
unfortunately.

96
00:06:24.515 --> 00:06:31.480
And so just simple addition,
multiplication, and division, subtraction.

97
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.873
All right, so here, inside of calc,

98
00:06:34.873 --> 00:06:40.175
what we're going to do is we're
gonna to say our var of h6,

99
00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:43.779
in other words, the base font size, and

100
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:49.745
we're gonna multiply it by our scale,
times var(--scale).

101
00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:54.908
So if you take 1.2 and
you multiply it by 1.25,

102
00:06:54.908 --> 00:06:59.858
you will wind up with 1.5 rem for
your font size.

103
00:07:02.273 --> 00:07:03.716
Why am I using rems?

104
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:10.583
Why wouldn't I use pixels?

105
00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:15.560
Anybody have a-
&gt;&gt; Pixels are set and rems are flexible.

106
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.380
&gt;&gt; Rems are more flexible, yeah.

107
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.589
What does rem stand for?

108
00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:22.893
&gt;&gt; Don't remember that.

109
00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:24.388
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; It is dumb.

110
00:07:24.388 --> 00:07:25.064
&gt;&gt; Looking it up now.

111
00:07:25.064 --> 00:07:29.336
&gt;&gt; It's a root relative great.

112
00:07:29.336 --> 00:07:31.330
What the heck does that mean and
what is an?

113
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.278
[LAUGH] Has to do with the width
of the lowercase letter m.

114
00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:43.680
So if you're working with a really
fat kinda font, that might be 1em.

115
00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:47.474
Or if you're working with one of
the really skinny fonts, right,

116
00:07:47.474 --> 00:07:48.636
that might be 1em.

117
00:07:48.636 --> 00:07:51.223
It's a very relative kind of size.

118
00:07:51.223 --> 00:07:55.569
So root relative means relative
to the root of the document,

119
00:07:55.569 --> 00:07:58.562
which in the browser sets to 16 pixels.

120
00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:02.772
So it makes your math much easier
as you work through this, okay?

121
00:08:02.772 --> 00:08:08.059
&gt;&gt; And so that's a one-dimensional thing,
is that length or width thread?

122
00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:11.757
&gt;&gt; It is the width of the lowercase,
I don't make the rules.

123
00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:18.381
Yeah, Robert Bringhurst will tell you
about that in his typography book.

124
00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:20.998
Okay, so now, we're gonna copy this.

125
00:08:20.998 --> 00:08:28.137
We're gonna say our h4 will
be the h5 times the scale and

126
00:08:28.137 --> 00:08:33.055
our h3 will be our h4 times the scale.

127
00:08:33.055 --> 00:08:35.873
And the reason we have to do it this
way is cuz we have no exponents.

128
00:08:35.873 --> 00:08:39.220
If we had exponents, we would be able
to say the scale to the squared,

129
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.316
the scale cubed, the scale to the fourth.

130
00:08:41.316 --> 00:08:45.022
Unfortunately, we don't have those in CSS,
so we do it this way.

131
00:08:46.774 --> 00:08:51.842
I'm gonna set up an h2,
which will be h3 times

132
00:08:51.842 --> 00:08:56.793
the scale, [COUGH] and
I'm gonna set up an h1.

133
00:08:56.793 --> 00:09:03.140
So it's the same pattern, it's just
the previous number times the scale.

134
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.638
The reason we do it this way is that
this will make perfectly proportioned

135
00:09:07.638 --> 00:09:12.504
headings sizes for you that will be all so
beautiful and your graphic designers

136
00:09:12.504 --> 00:09:17.466
will absolutely adore them, because
they are gonna follow a proportion here.

137
00:09:17.466 --> 00:09:21.159
So in other words,
we're increasing each size by 1.25.

138
00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:26.688
Okay, so now,
I want actually a size larger than this.

139
00:09:26.688 --> 00:09:34.178
I'm just gonna call it large,
and I want it bigger than the h1.

140
00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:39.864
So I'm gonna make this large,
it's gonna be h1 times the scale,

141
00:09:42.244 --> 00:09:48.037
And then I want an extra
large in addition to that.

142
00:09:48.037 --> 00:09:52.115
I want an extra large, and
to make my extra large,

143
00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:55.718
what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna take my h.

144
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.522
Just to show you that this can happen,
I could take my large times the scale.

145
00:10:02.522 --> 00:10:05.787
That's certainly one way of doing this,
but just to show you,

146
00:10:05.787 --> 00:10:07.337
you could also do it this way.

147
00:10:07.337 --> 00:10:08.609
We can take our h1 and

148
00:10:08.609 --> 00:10:12.519
we can multiply it by as many scales
as we wanted to make it bigger.

149
00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:16.736
So just to show you how that would work.

150
00:10:16.736 --> 00:10:20.952
So I'm gonna multiply it by two scales
in order to make this extra big, and

151
00:10:20.952 --> 00:10:24.149
it winds up being 7.15 rem
if you do all of that math.

152
00:10:24.149 --> 00:10:27.134
That is the same thing as large
times the scale, by the way.

153
00:10:30.794 --> 00:10:33.419
Okay, now, what if I want a smaller one?

154
00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:35.362
Anyone wanna take a guess?

155
00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:38.378
If I make a variable here called --small,

156
00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:41.403
what is the math going to look like for
this?

157
00:10:41.403 --> 00:10:42.282
&gt;&gt; Divide by the scale?

158
00:10:42.282 --> 00:10:44.461
&gt;&gt; Yeah, divided by the scale, exactly.

159
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:49.778
So we're gonna take our
variable of base-size,

160
00:10:49.778 --> 00:10:55.230
and we'll simply divide
by our variable of scale.

161
00:10:59.527 --> 00:11:05.655
And now, it'll put us just under one rem,
0.96 rem, okay?

162
00:11:05.655 --> 00:11:07.740
So that's what a type scale looks like.

163
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:12.113
I have a fuller explanation of that in
some of my other Frontend Masters' courses

164
00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:15.542
and that will walk you through
that in a little bit more detail.

165
00:11:15.542 --> 00:11:16.218
Yeah, Mark.

166
00:11:16.218 --> 00:11:20.407
&gt;&gt; Is it bad practice to change
the default's browser size for

167
00:11:20.407 --> 00:11:24.195
the font from 16 pixels to
whatever I might desire?

168
00:11:24.195 --> 00:11:25.748
&gt;&gt; You absolutely could change that.

169
00:11:25.748 --> 00:11:29.270
So here, I set it to 1.2 rem.

170
00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:34.107
In other words, 16 times 1.2,
which comes out to be what,

171
00:11:34.107 --> 00:11:37.796
18 or something, 18 pixels, 20 pixels.

172
00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:41.287
So I said 20 pixels is my base font size.

173
00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:43.488
So I did exactly what you just asked.

174
00:11:43.488 --> 00:11:47.116
I could also take this whole thing,
by the way,

175
00:11:47.116 --> 00:11:50.394
and let me hold this idea just for
a moment.

176
00:11:50.394 --> 00:11:55.382
You can change the base-size and
the scale in terms of their

177
00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:59.393
values later on and
scale your entire webpage.

178
00:11:59.393 --> 00:12:03.407
That is part of the reason that we do all
of this math once we actually apply all

179
00:12:03.407 --> 00:12:07.702
these wonderful variables, cuz nothing's
changed in how this page looks yet.

180
00:12:07.702 --> 00:12:10.224
That's because we haven't actually
applied our font scale yet.

181
00:12:10.224 --> 00:12:14.897
So the next thing we need to
do then is do exactly that.

182
00:12:14.897 --> 00:12:22.889
So what I'm going to do then,
I'm gonna set up some basic styling here.

183
00:12:22.889 --> 00:12:27.557
I'm gonna have an h1, an h2, and an h3.

184
00:12:27.557 --> 00:12:35.263
And while you're at it, I recommend you
do the following as well, .h1, .h2, .h3.

185
00:12:35.263 --> 00:12:39.535
So you can set up classes
that use those heading sizes.

186
00:12:39.535 --> 00:12:44.649
So in other words, we're styling the HTML
elements themselves, h1 through h3.

187
00:12:44.649 --> 00:12:46.754
We can also set up classes.

188
00:12:46.754 --> 00:12:54.196
So if you wanna apply the styles later
using these classes, you can do that.

189
00:12:54.196 --> 00:12:57.873
Here, we'll set our font-weight to 400.

190
00:12:57.873 --> 00:13:05.189
We can set our font-family
to var(--decorative).

191
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.293
Now, we're applying that.

192
00:13:11.293 --> 00:13:15.345
See how nicely that size just immediately
applied there to all of that?

193
00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:19.992
And we can set our margin.

194
00:13:19.992 --> 00:13:25.302
So all those headings by default have
some margin associated with them.

195
00:13:25.302 --> 00:13:28.622
And we are just turning all of
that margin off because, in fact,

196
00:13:28.622 --> 00:13:31.953
we're gonna set it separately for
each one of these font sizes.

197
00:13:31.953 --> 00:13:37.086
So those are styles that are going to
be in common with the headings and

198
00:13:37.086 --> 00:13:39.223
their associated classes.

199
00:13:39.223 --> 00:13:42.365
So I've sort of grouped those together.

200
00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:49.234
Then we can set up h1, .h1,
and we can get more specific.

201
00:13:49.234 --> 00:13:51.928
So what is my font-size gonna be here for
this?

202
00:13:51.928 --> 00:13:53.786
&gt;&gt; Var(--h1).

203
00:13:53.786 --> 00:13:54.782
&gt;&gt; Var(--h1).

204
00:13:57.735 --> 00:13:58.591
Look at that.

205
00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:04.941
We can also set a line-height.

206
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:09.685
So right now, that line-height is 1.5,
which is being inherited from

207
00:14:09.685 --> 00:14:13.087
the body element, but
I am going to change that to 1.

208
00:14:13.087 --> 00:14:18.642
Usually, your designers like to have
a little bit tighter line-height for

209
00:14:18.642 --> 00:14:23.608
some of these larger fonts than you do for
your regular paragraphs.

210
00:14:23.608 --> 00:14:28.269
Then we'll have our h2, .h2, and

211
00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:33.375
our font-size will be var(--h2).

212
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:41.724
And our line-height, Will be 1.1.

213
00:14:41.724 --> 00:14:45.111
I forgot my margin up here too.

214
00:14:45.111 --> 00:14:53.698
We can re-add some of this,
I'm gonna say margin-bottom, Var--h2).

215
00:14:53.698 --> 00:14:58.351
So notice, we were thinking about
font-sizes when we did all of that math.

216
00:14:58.351 --> 00:15:04.872
But we can also use that as a variable
inside of our paddings and our margins.

217
00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:08.225
How cool is that, okay?

218
00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:10.572
The math is done,
we might as well take advantage of it.

219
00:15:10.572 --> 00:15:16.471
Okay, so just to show you why
these scales are really powerful,

220
00:15:16.471 --> 00:15:19.866
so I can now change my base font size.

221
00:15:19.866 --> 00:15:24.183
Your boss comes back to you and
says, I want it bigger.

222
00:15:24.183 --> 00:15:30.100
So we say, okay, done.

223
00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:34.015
Whoa, all we have to do is just
change the one number, right?

224
00:15:34.015 --> 00:15:36.461
He says, I want it smaller.

225
00:15:36.461 --> 00:15:41.126
Done, okay, so
everything is already set up.

226
00:15:41.126 --> 00:15:46.057
All the relationships are set up, all we
have to do is change the base-size, right?

227
00:15:46.057 --> 00:15:48.196
We could also change the scale.

228
00:15:48.196 --> 00:15:52.967
So we want the scale to be
just a scale of 1, okay?

229
00:15:52.967 --> 00:15:55.070
Everything is all exactly the same size.

230
00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.268
What if it's 1.1, or
they're very tightly related?

231
00:15:59.268 --> 00:16:02.599
What if it's 1.2?

232
00:16:02.599 --> 00:16:05.765
See how the scaling is working here?

233
00:16:08.909 --> 00:16:12.927
We can make it ridiculously big,
but it still scales, right?

234
00:16:12.927 --> 00:16:17.439
So this is super handy when
you get to changing font sizes

235
00:16:17.439 --> 00:16:20.031
globally at your breakpoints.

236
00:16:20.031 --> 00:16:23.654
You want bigger sizes on your phone or
smaller sizes on your phone, or

237
00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:27.092
bigger on desktop or smaller on desktop,
whatever you wanna do,

238
00:16:27.092 --> 00:16:29.542
you just change the value
of these variables.

239
00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:37.582
You don't have to change a million
different HTML and classes, font sizes.

240
00:16:37.582 --> 00:16:38.391
Makes sense?

241
00:16:38.391 --> 00:16:43.301
&gt;&gt; You did something clever by
using the h4 as the margin size and

242
00:16:43.301 --> 00:16:46.238
you're using the previous margin.

243
00:16:46.238 --> 00:16:49.944
It seemed essentially that you had the
sizing in mind as you're going through,

244
00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:51.615
but I wonder if you can expand more.

245
00:16:51.615 --> 00:16:55.976
There one basically people are asking
if this is a very common practice or

246
00:16:55.976 --> 00:16:57.773
a pattern that we can follow.

247
00:16:57.773 --> 00:17:00.758
&gt;&gt; I think that will depend
on your graphic designers and

248
00:17:00.758 --> 00:17:04.620
what your graphic designers do in
terms of proportions and so forth.

249
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.494
So you could definitely work
with your graphic designer.

250
00:17:07.494 --> 00:17:11.708
And if you speak typography and say,
what scaling would you like to use,

251
00:17:11.708 --> 00:17:16.981
they might get all excited, you know about
type scaling, that's amazing, right?

252
00:17:16.981 --> 00:17:20.722
&gt;&gt; Sure, I think in a general way, you
could say what you're doing is just giving

253
00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:23.173
a margin that slightly
smaller than the font size.

254
00:17:23.173 --> 00:17:23.742
&gt;&gt; Correct.

255
00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:25.834
&gt;&gt; Essentially, and
you have these variables setup.

256
00:17:25.834 --> 00:17:27.440
&gt;&gt; I have them set up,
might as well use them.

257
00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.993
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Yup.

258
00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:30.583
&gt;&gt; So a follow-up question right on there.

259
00:17:30.583 --> 00:17:32.091
What's it like to have a designer?

260
00:17:32.091 --> 00:17:34.150
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I might ask for questions.

261
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.918
&gt;&gt; Having a designer is the most
amazing thing in the world.

262
00:17:36.918 --> 00:17:39.115
[LAUGH] It's totally awesome.

263
00:17:39.115 --> 00:17:41.926
Everything looks better when
you have a designer on.

264
00:17:41.926 --> 00:17:44.456
Make friends, be nice to them.

265
00:17:44.456 --> 00:17:45.485
They're great people.
