00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:02.183
Welcome to making TypeScript Stick.

2
00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:05.988
My name is Mike North,
I'm a senior staff engineer at LinkedIn,

3
00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:08.560
where I work on developer infrastructure.

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.478
I've been a Frontend Masters
instructor since 2015.

5
00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.524
And you may have seen some of my
other courses on the platform,

6
00:00:14.524 --> 00:00:17.638
like TypeScript fundamentals and
intermediate TypeScript.

7
00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:22.341
These two courses represent learning the
programming language, and after completing

8
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.910
these you should be comfortable
reading a lot of TypeScript code.

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.606
There are also these other great
courses on the platform that,

10
00:00:29.606 --> 00:00:33.728
to some extent assume you already
have a lot of TypeScript knowledge.

11
00:00:33.728 --> 00:00:38.057
And these courses on the bottom are about
applying that knowledge to solving

12
00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:38.943
a new problem.

13
00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:41.631
For example, in JS and TS Monorepos,

14
00:00:41.631 --> 00:00:47.178
we deal with the idea of having multiple
subpackages within a single Git repo.

15
00:00:47.178 --> 00:00:51.918
And it's almost taken as a given that you
can work with TypeScript proficiently.

16
00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:54.832
So when Mark the Frontend Master CEO and

17
00:00:54.832 --> 00:01:00.658
I were discussing what's next in
the TypeScript world for Frontend Masters,

18
00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:05.086
I told them that I wanted to
help people cross this gap here.

19
00:01:05.086 --> 00:01:09.020
And this gap represents the kind of
thing that you acquire through personal

20
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.153
experience through practice, right?

21
00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:14.433
And that's what this course is all about.

22
00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.789
Aside from some updates that have landed
recently in the TypeScript programming

23
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.479
language which we'll review, there's not
gonna be a whole lot of new material here.

24
00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.046
This is more about making
TypeScript Stick in your mind.

25
00:01:28.046 --> 00:01:31.360
The inspiration of this course
is a book called Make It Stick,

26
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.600
the Science of Successful for Learning.

27
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.968
This book deals with topics like knowledge
retention and building a mental model and

28
00:01:38.968 --> 00:01:43.049
getting from a state where you have
memorized a bunch of facts and

29
00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.388
you can recall them and
you can recite them, right?

30
00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:48.053
That's sort of the beginning of learning.

31
00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:51.477
And then how do you get from there to
being an expert where you can take what

32
00:01:51.477 --> 00:01:54.695
you've learned and apply it to
a problem you haven't seen before.

33
00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:58.476
So make it stick is a great
book if you're interested,

34
00:01:58.476 --> 00:02:03.082
it's really popular among educators,
and in fact we're using it

35
00:02:03.082 --> 00:02:07.545
at LinkedIn to create the next
version of our new hire bootcamp.

36
00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:11.810
So what does this mean for
what you can expect from this course?

37
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.098
Well, first, we're going to go through
some challenging learning experiences.

38
00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:21.694
And this is because there's some
science that suggests challenging

39
00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:25.583
learning experiences sink
in more effectively, right?

40
00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:30.011
If we were to sit here all day and
do really easy problems,

41
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:33.352
it's not a very memorable thing, right?

42
00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:36.616
You're not gonna get a lot out of it,
similar to if you go to the gym and

43
00:02:36.616 --> 00:02:38.773
you pick up the lightest
weight you can find.

44
00:02:38.773 --> 00:02:43.003
You're not going to actually build any
muscle or get more fit through doing that,

45
00:02:43.003 --> 00:02:45.159
you need to kind of push your boundaries.

46
00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.146
And when I say challenging of course,

47
00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.819
I mean interesting problems that
are sort of pushing the boundaries.

48
00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.383
We're not just gonna shrink the text
on the slide really small so

49
00:02:54.383 --> 00:02:58.277
you can hardly read it, there has
to be a meaningful challenge there.

50
00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:03.165
So, another thing you'll notice
is there's going to be varied and

51
00:03:03.165 --> 00:03:04.889
randomized practice.

52
00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.152
So if you've ever taken a class maybe in
school where you kind of have a lecture

53
00:03:09.152 --> 00:03:12.121
and then a test immediately
following that lecture.

54
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:16.021
And then you move on to another topic and
you never return to that first thing,

55
00:03:16.021 --> 00:03:19.147
it's very easy for
that information to fall out of your mind.

56
00:03:19.147 --> 00:03:23.889
Effectively you're giving your brain
permission to let go of that information

57
00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.244
through not using it.

58
00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:29.315
So, part of what make
it stick advocates for

59
00:03:29.315 --> 00:03:36.262
is continued recall of that information
as you apply it in different ways.

60
00:03:36.262 --> 00:03:40.737
And you're gonna see that we come at
TypeScript from all sorts of different

61
00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:41.312
angles.

62
00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:45.512
There are gonna be some games,
some hands on programming challenges,

63
00:03:45.512 --> 00:03:49.502
some discussion, some kind of wacky
challenges where we'll try to

64
00:03:49.502 --> 00:03:52.241
solve problems using
only type information.

65
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:57.435
And the idea here is to see these things
from all sorts of different angles,

66
00:03:57.435 --> 00:04:02.795
so that we maximize the potential for
you to have that moment of enlightenment

67
00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:07.341
where the light bulb turns on and
you feel like you get it, right?

68
00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:12.550
In terms of reaching that moment
of clarity, a lot of people get

69
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.173
there through either rule-based or
example-based approaches.

70
00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:21.755
And you may find that one of
these ways works for you,

71
00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:25.435
people generally fall into
one of these two buckets.

72
00:04:25.435 --> 00:04:29.419
People who prefer a rule-based approach,
they want to learn about the rules of

73
00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.048
a system and
the kind of build up their mental model.

74
00:04:32.048 --> 00:04:36.806
And maybe they can understand how
something works without seeing too many

75
00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:41.802
examples, but they want to see the
specification, like how does this work?

76
00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:43.167
How does mental work?

77
00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:46.712
Others don't get a lot out of sort
of that theoretical knowledge,

78
00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:50.590
they want to compare and contrast
different examples in the real world.

79
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.165
And they kind of infer how
things work based on that, and

80
00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:57.829
that's how they reached that
moment of enlightenment.

81
00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:00.511
So we're gonna have a mix of these two,

82
00:05:00.511 --> 00:05:05.324
just because I want to turn on as many
light bulbs as I can for all of you.

83
00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:09.428
In terms of how I recommend taking this
course, not that it's an option for

84
00:05:09.428 --> 00:05:10.862
those watching live, but

85
00:05:10.862 --> 00:05:14.921
if you're watching the video,
try to space this course out a little bit.

86
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:21.999
Watch a little every morning for a week,
give this a little bit of room to breathe.

87
00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:26.915
There is some research that suggests
space it out learning is about

88
00:05:26.915 --> 00:05:30.436
90% more effective than cramming, right?

89
00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:34.020
So if you've ever crammed for
an exam study like crazy the night before,

90
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.133
everything kind of falls out, you sort of
put everything in your short term cache,

91
00:05:38.133 --> 00:05:39.452
it's very easy to let go.

92
00:05:39.452 --> 00:05:44.015
So space it out, and
also own your learning journey.

93
00:05:44.015 --> 00:05:48.595
So this is something that I do, I have
a learning journal where when I have

94
00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:52.802
trouble wrapping my head around something,
I'll write it down,

95
00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:56.202
I'll write down what parts
of that topic confuse me.

96
00:05:56.202 --> 00:06:01.064
And, this gives me a place to keep coming
back when I have time to invest in

97
00:06:01.064 --> 00:06:04.754
myself and to sort things up and
do some extra reading.

98
00:06:04.754 --> 00:06:06.401
It helps focus me in and

99
00:06:06.401 --> 00:06:11.964
spend my time on the things that are
blocking me from sort of moving forward.

100
00:06:11.964 --> 00:06:15.748
And as an added benefit every time
you're struggling with something if you

101
00:06:15.748 --> 00:06:18.584
open this book and
you see a bunch of crossed out topics.

102
00:06:18.584 --> 00:06:22.333
The things that seemed
impossible at one point in time,

103
00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:27.280
it's very reassuring to say this
current thing that seems like I'm never

104
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.408
gonna get it, it's just like things
that I've conquered before, right?

105
00:06:32.408 --> 00:06:35.283
It's just one more thing to the pile.

106
00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:40.009
So with that,
let's jump over to the course website,

107
00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.419
bit.ly, and then make-ts-stick.
