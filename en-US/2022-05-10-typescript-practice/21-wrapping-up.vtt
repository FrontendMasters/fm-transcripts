00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.260
So thanks very much for
attending Making TypeScript Stick.

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.120
I hope all this practice that we've gotten
today has helped you kind of cement

3
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.529
your mental model and learn some new
things that you can do on your own,

4
00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:16.663
like the type challenges to take
your learning journey further.

5
00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:20.871
And to go from being someone that can
understand how to read TypeScript

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.381
to a TypeScript master.

00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:24.123
