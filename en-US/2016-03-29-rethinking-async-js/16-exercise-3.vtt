00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:07.030
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
let's practice with promises in a chain.

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.580
We're gonna go back to the same
exercise that we did before.

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.320
I want you to open up exercise three,
and I want to give you the hint that,

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.169
kind of like what we did in exercise
two where getFile produced something,

6
00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.880
now getFile is going to
need to produce a promise.

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.276
So we're still gonna
call getFile three times.

8
00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:30.230
One for file one one for
file two one for file three.

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.590
We're gonna get three promises back,
that's the easy part.

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.120
I'll give you that for free.

11
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.950
But now your task is using
what I just taught you about

12
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.550
how promises chained together.

13
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.320
How are you going to sequence
the responses to those promises?

14
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.200
In thumps the way we sequenced
them was to nest them together,

15
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.470
but how do we sequence promises together?

16
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.600
I just taught you to, go back and look
at those slides and try exercise three.

17
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.830
Just so we make sure we're on the same
page, let me open that up just so

18
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.240
you can see what we're talking about.

19
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.830
Exercise three,
this getFile right here on line 22,

20
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.710
that's where you need to produce
a promise for what's happening.

21
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.520
And then we're gonna still call
the getFile function three times, and

22
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.800
then we're gonna sequence
those promises together.

23
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.420
So let me give you five or
six minutes to try your hand at that.

24
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.702
Go back and look at the last five or
six slides that I just showed you.

25
00:01:23.702 --> 00:01:27.143
They're gonna tell you exactly how to
accomplish that, all of those steps.

26
00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:29.640
And see what you can come up with and then
we'll talk about that in a few minutes.
