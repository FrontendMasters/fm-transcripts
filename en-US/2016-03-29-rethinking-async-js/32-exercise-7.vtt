&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So how are we feeling
about generator Let's try an exercise and

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.990
see how we're feeling about generators.

4
00:00:12.314 --> 00:00:16.050
We're gonna go one more time,
deep back in the well one more time.

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.080
This running example that we've had of
making the three calls in parallel and

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.140
sequencing their responses.

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.350
I cannot wait for you to see how cool
the solution is with generators.

8
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.970
This is the hardest thing for me to do,
to wait ten more minutes while you try it,

9
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.230
cuz I just wanna show it to you right now.

10
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.170
But I wanna give you a chance to practice
thinking about generators the way I

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.530
just talked about, try to see if you
can get your brain wrapped around.

12
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.560
How would I do things in parallel,
but then wait for

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.330
them to sequence their output?

14
00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.780
So try exercise seven with a generator.

15
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.041
You can use a sequence to run
it cuz that's pretty convenient,

16
00:00:52.041 --> 00:00:54.330
it's already included there for you.

17
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.530
The last five or

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.960
six slides should have more than
enough info to help you with that.
