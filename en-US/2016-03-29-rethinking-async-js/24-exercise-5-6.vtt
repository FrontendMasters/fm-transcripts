&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The next two exercises,

3
00:00:05.077 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm actually gonna assign
exercise five and six together.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.980
And here's what they are, exercise five is
exactly the same thing as exercise three.

5
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.900
Remember we did the promise chain?

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.510
But now exercise five invites you to
use a sequence to create a chain.

7
00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.720
Exercise six is exactly
the same as exercise four,

8
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.580
where we did map and reduce.

9
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.040
But it invites you to use a sequence
in a looping fashion, and

10
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.590
you'll find out that it's easier to do.

11
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.280
You don't even need to reduce, you can
do it with two maps using a sequence.

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.000
So both of those exercises are designed to
give you some time to get more comfortable

13
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.100
with a sequence using it, so
that we can use it throughout the rest.

14
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.418
I will say this, basically what
we're gonna do is just stop for

15
00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.105
the next 20 minutes to let
you work on the exercises.

16
00:00:54.105 --> 00:00:57.102
If you're already familiar
with a sequence, or

17
00:00:57.102 --> 00:01:01.712
if you don't really care about it,
consider the two exercises optional.

18
00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:04.504
But they are designed to let you go
back and do what you just did but

19
00:01:04.504 --> 00:01:07.230
with a sequence to kind to
get more familiar with it.

20
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.580
So you should be able to compare
the solutions between three and five, and

21
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.905
four and six, pretty straightforwardly.
