[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:08.672
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So just as that quick review,
this is really all about plus.

3
00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:11.241
This is an and, not an or.

4
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.140
We want callbacks and thunks.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.890
We want promises and generators,
and observables, and CSP.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.200
We want all these tools available to us,

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.770
cuz that's gonna make
us better developers.

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.480
Okay?

9
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.310
As a reminder this is
my contact information.

10
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.970
I strongly encourage and

11
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.140
challenge you to not let this be
the last time you go over the material.

12
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.435
Go back to these exercises in a couple
of weeks and try them from scratch.

13
00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.835
Go back over the slides, over your notes.

14
00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:42.895
Try these things and try to work them
into the work that you're doing.

15
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:44.558
Even if you think you
have a boss who is like,

16
00:00:44.558 --> 00:00:47.455
he'll never care that I'm doing this
kinda stuff, that doesn't mean that

17
00:00:47.455 --> 00:00:51.575
you can't use the stuff that you do at
work as an opportunity to learn better.

18
00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:55.409
Even if you're trying and stuff out, and
even if that code never gets committed in,

19
00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.550
and it's still better that you try
it in context and learn from that.

20
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.120
And I'd courage you that when you learn
something, if you've learned something

21
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.340
here today, or if you feel like you
learned something when you go back over

22
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.580
some stuff, go write a little two or
three paragraph blog post about it.

23
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.300
Try to teach someone else.

24
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.700
Because you really learn best, when you're
forced to try to teach somebody else.

25
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.170
So whatever your realm is,

26
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.130
you don't have to have the word teacher
in your job title to be a teacher.

27
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.900
You can write a blog post, you can go
to a meet up and talk about it, and

28
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.130
give a lightning talk about it,
write a book about it.

29
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.570
I mean, do whatever you wanna do, but give
a brown bag lunch at work, say hey I just

30
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.660
went to this workshop, let me show you
some of the stuff that I learned, right?

31
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.750
That is how you'll solidify the learning,

32
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.480
is to practice those
things then teach others.

33
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.960
So in that process of going through those
things, if you ever have any questions you

34
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.398
feel overwhelmed by something today,
and you know you wanna circle back,

35
00:01:47.398 --> 00:01:49.950
and you've got some questions about it,
when you want to go back.

36
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.960
Please feel free to reach out,

37
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.230
there's dozens of different
ways to get a hold of me.

38
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.770
I love doing this.

39
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.290
This is what I,
I'm all in on the teaching thing,

40
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.710
trying to help people
understand JavaScript better.

41
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.390
It's been a super huge honor to be here.

42
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.030
I appreciate all of your attention and

43
00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.440
sticking with it,
through a bunch of challenging material.

44
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.960
Thanks very much for being here,
and happy JavaScript learning.
