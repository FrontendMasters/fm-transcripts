&gt;&gt; Kyle: So exercise nine is that exact
same exercise that we did before,

3
00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.030
the one with the clicking the buttons and
the sampling.

4
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.810
But now I'm gonna try to see if you can
figure out how to do this with CSP, okay?

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.224
So we'll take a let's say 20 minute break.

6
00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:20.872
Not 20 minute break.

7
00:00:20.872 --> 00:00:22.900
But a 20 minute work on this.

8
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.900
It's more challenging
than the observables one.

9
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.320
It's more brain bending.

10
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.390
You should have most of what you need
from the slides that I just gave you.

11
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.580
But certainly feel free to reach out and
ask questions,

12
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.780
or look at the fixed version of
the file if you need some hints.
