00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.613
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.613 --> 00:00:06.656
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The element that was
clicked on is an atag right which has

3
00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:07.810
an href in it.

4
00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.220
And that href is the URL that
we want to load, we want

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.150
to load that file up we essentially
want to make an Ajax request for

6
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.168
that file get its contents and
stuff it into a model.

7
00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:25.160
So I can get the URL by looking at
the element that was clicked on,

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.452
which is going to be evt.target,

9
00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:34.050
that's the link that we clicked on.

10
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.070
And I want to jQueryify that element
because I want helpers for it.

11
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.618
So I'm just gonna wrap $ for
in to see around that element and

12
00:00:47.618 --> 00:00:52.946
I want to get it's href
attribute in the way

13
00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:59.166
we do that in JavaScript is .attr("href").

14
00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:05.611
Just double check myself
against the solution file here.

15
00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:25.581
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay,
so now I have the URL,

16
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:31.000
jQuery has a nice simple syntax for
doing Ajax.

17
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.760
If you don't want to type this part
you're free to kind of just copy and

18
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.770
paste it which is what I'm going to
do because I don't want to type it.

19
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.140
So you can copy and paste from
the solutions file if you'd like but

20
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.060
this is how we do an Ajax call.

21
00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.280
I'm giving it the URL and I'm telling it
that I'm expecting to get back text, so

22
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.030
that it doesn't do any parsing and

23
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.300
this dot then is basically
how I specify my callback.

24
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.309
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just wondering why
you didn't use prevent default?

25
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.420
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: We did
use prevent default but

26
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.140
the question is why did
I do the other two?

27
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.190
We don't have to do the other
two in this example,

28
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.330
I just did it because
there's a habit that I do.

29
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.150
Like I call all three of those
usually just by habit but

30
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.460
in our particular situation, we actually
don't care about the propagation.

31
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.190
We only care about stopping
the default behavior so

32
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.865
it would be acceptable if
you didn't put them in.

33
00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:38.150
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So once I've loaded
the contents up as an Ajax request,

34
00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.430
remember that looks exactly
like we did before.

35
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.390
There's an Ajax call and I get a callback
then I get some contents back.

36
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.980
Now I need to add that to my modal.

37
00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.070
So we don't have this variable yet,
but we can declare this variable and

38
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.939
have that variable point at the modal,
that's going to be our last step.

39
00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.910
We wanna declare a variable
called modal and

40
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.970
we wanna get at it the same way
we get it any other variable,

41
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.510
didn't understand the URL line, okay?

42
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.440
The first thing is to get
the element that was clicked on,

43
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.730
that's what evt.target is and
then the link,

44
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.510
the A tag that we clicked on we
want to get its href attribute.

45
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.575
When you get the value
of the href attribute.

46
00:03:35.727 --> 00:03:39.818
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So in our index that
would be getting as register.html or

47
00:03:39.818 --> 00:03:43.580
the login.html,
that's the value we want to get.

48
00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.260
Okay, so

49
00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.140
how are we going to get a reference to
the modal that we want to click on?

50
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.940
Or I mean that we want to add content to?

51
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.170
Other we get reference so
that we come to our markup and

52
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.180
we find that there's a modal
there with real js-modal.

53
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.838
So we get it exactly
the same way we're getting

54
00:04:16.838 --> 00:04:21.621
the other ones which is
to say rel=js-modal.

55
00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:30.970
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I have a stylistic
convention that you see on line three.

56
00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.010
Which is that any variable that
I declare in my code which

57
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.830
points at a jQuery object.

58
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.688
I always prefix my variable
names with dollar signs,

59
00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:42.555
just to make it clear that
I'm dealing with a jQuery.

60
00:04:46.354 --> 00:04:50.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There's nothing actually
special about the dollar sign, is there?

61
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.343
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Not in variable names,
there is not, yeah?

62
00:04:53.343 --> 00:04:56.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
the few questions there.

63
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.990
Could we have used $this?

64
00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.590
You didn't cover that question?

65
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.530
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I didn't
covered that question,

66
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.900
the question is basically if I do
need to do event the target or

67
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.700
could I have used this.

68
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.550
You do not want to use dollar sign thus,
I know that many people are familiar with

69
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.809
and have seen that in a lot of places,
it is not as reliable as you would expect.

70
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.330
In our particular case
it would have worked but

71
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.000
there are lots of other cases
where the event propagation

72
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.675
that is the bubbling stuff where
it doesn't point at what you want.

73
00:05:27.675 --> 00:05:30.970
jQuery make sure that event the target

74
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.150
always points at the thing
that got clicked on.

75
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.259
So it's a reliable parameter and that's
why I always use it out of that habit.

76
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.627
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The question is,
is .NET native to JS?

77
00:05:45.627 --> 00:05:47.179
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: This
is part of the jQuery,

78
00:05:47.179 --> 00:05:51.230
let's talk then that's happening here,
that's part of just crazy.

79
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:56.769
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
you're saying that that's not a promise.

80
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.460
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: jQuery is
not using real promise.

81
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.740
jQuery is doing their own version of
stuff that looks a little bit like

82
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.710
a promise, but isn't.

83
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.190
The other question is our native
promises coming to JavaScript?

84
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.100
Yes, they are coming to us six.

85
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.940
It's just that these are not made of
promises so the dot then that you see

86
00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.230
there looks like it's a native promise,
but it's actually just a jQuery API.

87
00:06:27.072 --> 00:06:29.659
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I might've lost some
of you already even though I walked you

88
00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:31.430
through it, and that's totally okay.

89
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.380
Don't feel frustrated and
walk away, walk out on me.

90
00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.540
The point that I'm making here
is that we're already using

91
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.880
some of the concepts that we talked
about in our earlier course.

92
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.290
For example, we're passing in
a callback function, all right.

93
00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:56.336
So if I just hid all of the contents
of Johnny's a little trick in sublime.

94
00:06:56.336 --> 00:07:01.630
That does code folding, okay.

95
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.920
So I just hit it temporarily,
I'll bring it back in a minute but

96
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.700
if you look at this function.

97
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:12.780
I mean if you look at this dollar sign
is a function, on is a function and

98
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.360
if you look at the parameters that
are being passed to the on call.

99
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.660
There is three parameters being passed,

100
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:24.030
one of which is a function that
we passed and it's a callback.

101
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.380
Exactly like passing a callback
into a set timeout or

102
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.710
passing a call back
into any other utility.

103
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.380
We're passing a call back,
we're asking for

104
00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.860
this callback to be invoked, to be run.

105
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.170
Whenever somebody clicks on a link,
it's not going to happen right away.

106
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.388
They're going to wait a few seconds and
we want it to happen whenever it does.

107
00:07:48.652 --> 00:07:53.225
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay,
so you're back here.

108
00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:06.412
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right,
so if we Save this file and

109
00:08:06.412 --> 00:08:10.630
we reload our page to Refresh our page.

110
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.390
If I didn't mess something
up now when I click Login,

111
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.669
it pops up a modal with
the login contents in it.

112
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.870
Now I don't have any close buttons or
whatever we do that later in the exercise.

113
00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:24.200
So right now we just pop up a modal but

114
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.270
if I Refresh and obviously it
refreshes the page and goes away.

115
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.670
If I click Register I get
the register page loaded.

116
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.380
So that's the step that you should be at
is being able to load that content and

117
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:35.020
put it in a modal.

118
00:08:37.423 --> 00:08:40.765
P-R-O-P-A-G.

119
00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:57.777
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The good news is [LAUGH]
if this was complicated and you got lost

120
00:08:57.777 --> 00:09:03.450
or you feel a little bit intimidated
by this, which is totally okay.

121
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:08.490
The first time I saw code like
this I was lost, trust me.

122
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.950
If this is complicated to you,

123
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:15.589
the good news is that this is about as
complex as jQuery programming gets.

124
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.020
I started you off with
an example that kind of,

125
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.960
it shows a lot of
different pieces moving in.

126
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.280
Pulling in an element from the dom,
that's what this first call is doing.

127
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.320
This is pulling in an element from
the dom by its rel attribute,

128
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.390
the same thing we did with modal.

129
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:36.240
Calling a method on that chain, calling
.on and giving it several parameters,

130
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:42.410
making an Ajax call setting the inner html
of those contents, showing an element.

131
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:49.220
This is basically like 80% of what people
do with jQuery in this one little snippet.

132
00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.600
So even though it may feel like while this
is kind of like, overwhelming or whatever.

133
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:58.452
If you take some time to digest just this
one file you've actually probably got

134
00:09:58.452 --> 00:10:02.363
the same amount of skills as
50% of jQuery developers have.

135
00:10:04.677 --> 00:10:09.518
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And the other thing
to note is that we didn't do anything

136
00:10:09.518 --> 00:10:12.435
tricky with JavaScript itself.

137
00:10:12.435 --> 00:10:17.190
99% of the complexity that we see
in this file is jQuery related,

138
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:18.250
not JavaScript related.

139
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.010
So if you spend time to
learn a tool like jQuery,

140
00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:26.860
like I've taken time to learn, then you
can sling about the jQuery stuff, and

141
00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:29.130
it just works and
the same is true of JavaScript.

142
00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:33.110
If you learn the JavaScript fundamentals,
you can sling JavaScript around and

143
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:34.360
you won't get confused.

144
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.374
So this is just another thing to learn,
it's a jQuery library that's helpful.

145
00:10:38.374 --> 00:10:42.380
It makes the code to do this
without jQuery would be worse.

146
00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:45.210
So even though it may look ugly it's
better than it would have been.

147
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:52.920
Question here,
why not using a comma role js controls?

148
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:57.800
You totally could have done it that way,
I don't like to use tag names or IDs.

149
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.750
I try to avoid dom specific things like
what tag name was used or whatever.

150
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.724
So that's why I would avoid using A but

151
00:11:04.724 --> 00:11:09.057
there's lots of different ways to use the
jQuery API, this is just one of several.

152
00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:18.345
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What else did you work
on after header dodginess I didn't.

153
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.841
The only code that we've changed
right now so far as header.js.

154
00:11:29.513 --> 00:11:32.570
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Yup,
header.js is all we touched, okay.

155
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:37.410
Any questions here about
stuff I can clear up for you.

156
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.400
It would have been rather cruel of me to
expect you to just know all this stuff

157
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.180
that's why I walked you through it.

158
00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.560
Fortunately, the next thing that I'm
gonna ask you to do is going to be

159
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.530
a bit simpler.

160
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:50.140
It's gonna build off of some of the stuff,
you wanna have your file in that state.

161
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.919
If you don't want to retype
all that stuff, just copy and

162
00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:55.826
paste that whole file from.

163
00:11:59.538 --> 00:12:00.413
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Over there,

164
00:12:00.413 --> 00:12:03.760
which is totally fine if
you want to do it that way.
