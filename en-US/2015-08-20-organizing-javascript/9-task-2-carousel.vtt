[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:05.513
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's
go back to our read me.

3
00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:11.153
We've handled steps one and

4
00:00:11.153 --> 00:00:16.328
two and three of task one.

5
00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:17.657
Step four says there's nothing else.

6
00:00:17.657 --> 00:00:20.971
So we're now complete with task one.

7
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:23.390
Is there a way to exit
the modal without using it?

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.300
Now we don't have a way to exit it yet,

9
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.280
we're gonna come back to that
later in our exercise today.

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.360
Right now, the modal once a pops up,
it stays there until we refresh the page.

11
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.890
So, we'll fix that later.

12
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.390
So, task one, little overwhelming
perhaps but It really did start to show

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.980
some practical application of the concepts
that we were just foo barring earlier.

14
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.500
So, I hope that answered some
questions that people had earlier.

15
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.990
We'll be looking at more of
those practical applications,

16
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.270
that's the goal here, this part of
the workshop is all about doing practical

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.710
application of the concepts from earlier.

18
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.254
So let's turn our
attention now to task two.

19
00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:09.966
It says we need to open up carousel.js and
details.js, and so

20
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:12.002
I want you to go ahead and do those.

21
00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:15.610
I'm gonna close out a few of these
files that I don't need for right now,

22
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.449
like I don't need the style CSS,
let's close header for

23
00:01:18.449 --> 00:01:21.640
now we don't even need that one,
well come back to it.

24
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.666
Let's open up.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Carousel and

25
00:01:26.666 --> 00:01:31.776
details.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And hopefully it will be

26
00:01:31.776 --> 00:01:38.015
clear fairly quickly that I've
done a lot of the work already.

27
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:41.738
[LAUGH] I didn't want you to have
to figure out all the math for

28
00:01:41.738 --> 00:01:44.746
how to do a left and
right, scroll or whatever.

29
00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:48.130
If you wanna try your hand at it and
challenge yourself you can delete

30
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.370
my code and try it but
I've already provided you the math for

31
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.030
how to do a scroll left and
scroll right for a carousel.

32
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.580
I've already set up all the stuff,
at the very bottom here it says,

33
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.760
you wanna attach click handlers for
the left, a dollar

34
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.790
sign left is the left button and the
dollars sign right is the right button.

35
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.810
So you just want attach click handlers to
them, and have those click handlers call

36
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.640
the scroll left and the scroll right
functions that I've already written.

37
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.090
So that's just two lines of code,

38
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.280
that's going to be much
much more straight forward.

39
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.140
The details one has slightly more work but
not a lot.

40
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.285
And we'll come back to that.

41
00:02:29.285 --> 00:02:31.929
So let's look at the read me,
what does it tell us to do first?

42
00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.472
The first item number two here it says,

43
00:02:34.472 --> 00:02:39.550
in carousel.js add those event handlers
for the left and right carousels.

44
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.487
I'm gonna do the first one for you.

45
00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:48.270
And then it'll be really easy for
you to figure out the second one, okay?

46
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.180
So I have a dollar sign left element and
I have a scroll left function.

47
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.274
And I wanna put those two
together as a click handler.

48
00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.570
So all that's left down here at
the bottom, I'll take out those comments,

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.045
to set up the left one,
I just say dollar sign

50
00:03:07.045 --> 00:03:11.840
left on click and give it a call back.

51
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.636
What's my call back?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Scroll Left.

52
00:03:14.636 --> 00:03:16.278
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Scroll left.

53
00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:18.503
Right, that's it.

54
00:03:18.503 --> 00:03:23.800
So super difficult task for you,
[LAUGH] do the one for scroll right.

55
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.739
And that should look like dollar sign

56
00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.360
right dot on click scroll right.

57
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.710
Okay, save that file.

58
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.590
Let's refresh our page.

59
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.872
Let's see what kind of magic
we now have access to.

60
00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:46.999
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm no where near that fast

61
00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:50.219
at typing.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, sorry about that.

62
00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:58.793
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH]

63
00:03:58.793 --> 00:03:59.783
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I'm sorry,

64
00:03:59.783 --> 00:04:04.197
did you pull all that out of
the solution and then paste it?

65
00:04:04.197 --> 00:04:04.785
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: No, no, no,

66
00:04:04.785 --> 00:04:08.021
this is the starting version of this file,
the only two lines that I had to write

67
00:04:08.021 --> 00:04:13.174
here were these two lines.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: I have only two lines

68
00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:19.310
in mine [CROSSTALK]
never mind.

69
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.562
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Yeah,

70
00:04:26.562 --> 00:04:27.810
there's a question in the chat room.

71
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.310
The callback goes without parentheses.

72
00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.190
Exactly, if we put parentheses
here what would happen?

73
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.770
It would call scroll left immediately and
the return value from that is what would

74
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.850
get bound which isn't a function so
that wouldn't help.

75
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.824
So yeah,
we definitely just pass it by name.

76
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:48.484
Okay, so now if we refresh the page, but

77
00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:54.484
now I have a silly, but working carousel.

78
00:05:00.457 --> 00:05:04.286
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: By the way just as
a little side note, I did have a slight

79
00:05:04.286 --> 00:05:08.783
amount of math as you can see here
like figuring out to add plus and

80
00:05:08.783 --> 00:05:13.366
minus 250 in position but
you notice I'm not doing any work for

81
00:05:13.366 --> 00:05:17.813
animations, though when we run it,
it is smoothly animated.

82
00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:21.150
The way I achieved that, CSS animations.

83
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.423
So if you look at the CSS stylesheet,
sorry CSS transition.

84
00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:29.382
If you look at the CSS stylesheet,
it's so cool how easy this is.

85
00:05:29.382 --> 00:05:35.289
On the CSS stylesheet the items element
is the one that's moving around and

86
00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.724
I just put a transition on it which
says when I change the left property

87
00:05:40.724 --> 00:05:46.090
instead of it happening immediately
I want it to take half a second.

88
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.390
And this last parameter here is for
easing so

89
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.030
that it looks a little smoother
as it eases out and moves in.

90
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.290
So one line of CSS instead of invoking
some crazy JavaScript animation library.

91
00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.663
And it provided a nice
little smooth movement for

92
00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:05.937
us.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Like I said,

93
00:06:05.937 --> 00:06:10.430
that's the most proud I can be of CSS,
cuz that's about all I know.

94
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.243
That's about the sum total
of my CSS knowledge.

95
00:06:13.243 --> 00:06:16.215
[COUGH] Okay, so carousel.

96
00:06:16.215 --> 00:06:19.490
It's only 41 lines of code.

97
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.950
We don't need complex plugins to do simple
little tasks like what we're showing here.

98
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.340
There are tens of thousands of great
plugins out there in the J Query world

99
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.020
from everything that you can imagine.

100
00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.010
Calendar widgets, there's about 100,000
different carousel plugins that you

101
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.550
can get and they're all much much more
complex with lots of extra features.

102
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.090
I just prefer to approach everything that
I do from the most basic and simple and

103
00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.220
then work my way up.

104
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.386
Instead of going and grabbing the most
complex crazy thing that I can and

105
00:06:49.386 --> 00:06:51.996
dropping it in, and
having to learn a whole crazy new API.

106
00:06:51.996 --> 00:06:55.762
It really just boils down to,
do I know how to do adding and

107
00:06:55.762 --> 00:06:58.124
subtracting of the number 250?

108
00:06:58.124 --> 00:07:01.452
That was about it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: They're asking where that

109
00:07:01.452 --> 00:07:03.133
250 came from.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Trial and error.

110
00:07:03.133 --> 00:07:04.496
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: 250 pixels.

111
00:07:04.496 --> 00:07:06.160
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: My little icons are 200

112
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.947
pixels wide and
I have a 50 pixel padding in between them.

113
00:07:09.947 --> 00:07:11.019
So that's it.

114
00:07:11.019 --> 00:07:13.704
[LAUGH]
