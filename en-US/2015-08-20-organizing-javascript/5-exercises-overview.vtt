2
00:00:03.788 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So
the folder is called jsorg and let's open.

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.134
Let's start by opening up
the Read Me just to orient

4
00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:15.475
ourselves.
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: In this exercise, you're

5
00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:21.319
going to modify an existing code to wire
up basic interactivity for a simple site.

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.000
The objective of this challenge
is to exercise your skills with

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.550
basic JavaScript, including events and

8
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.820
DOM interactions, as well as some
best practices for organizing code.

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.170
In fact, it's that latter
one that we more care about.

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.172
We more care about seeing in practice
how we organize JavaScript code than

11
00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:44.433
necessarily exactly how we deal with
events interactions although there will

12
00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.996
be some practice with that.

13
00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:51.685
So we're gonna use jQuery as our little
library that helps us do events and

14
00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:53.897
interactions more easily.

15
00:00:53.897 --> 00:00:57.029
If you don't have any experience with
jQuery at all, that's totally cool cuz

16
00:00:57.029 --> 00:01:00.080
I'm gonna show you the little bits and
pieces that you need to know about it.

17
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.311
But this is not a course on jQuery so

18
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:06.985
I'm not gonna get much into the details
of it, I'll just show you what to do.

19
00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:10.500
But there's one thing here this **Note**
that I want to point out to you.

20
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.825
And I wish there was a way for

21
00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:15.763
me to make this detail not something
that you have to worry about.

22
00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:17.550
If there was any way, I as a teacher,

23
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.821
could just make this detail go away,
I would.

24
00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:23.739
Unfortunately, we have a complicating
detail here for you to run this exercise

25
00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:27.710
because we're gonna be doing AJAX
requests inside of the exercise.

26
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.797
If you're using Chrome or IE,

27
00:01:29.797 --> 00:01:35.060
you're gonna need something more than
just running with these files themselves.

28
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.780
If you choose Firefox, Firefox at
the moment doesn't have a security

29
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.380
restriction on it and we're able to do
AJAX just from one file to another.

30
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.807
So it's an easier story
if you're using Firefox.

31
00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:50.554
If you're using something like Chrome or
like IE, like I am,

32
00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:55.685
you're gonna actually need to run a little
local web server instance in the folder.

33
00:01:55.685 --> 00:02:00.252
So that you can load it up through local
host in your browser rather than through

34
00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:01.430
the file system.

35
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.200
So if you're on a Mac,
this is actually really easy.

36
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.281
If you're in the directory, as I am here.

37
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:14.962
All you need to do if you're
on a recent Mac is type in

38
00:02:14.962 --> 00:02:20.131
python minus -m and then SimpleHTTPServer.

39
00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:24.051
And then, the last parameter is a port
number which I always like 8005 for

40
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:25.950
whatever reason.

41
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.470
What this is gonna do is spin up a simple
static file server in that directory so

42
00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.430
that we can access the contents
of the directory as

43
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.880
if it was coming from a web server.

44
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.350
If you're not running on a Mac,
you can still get Python for free.

45
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.467
You can download from python.org,
a Python interpreter, and

46
00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:46.092
it will run very similar to this.

47
00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:49.607
It's a slightly different syntax but
it runs very similar to that and

48
00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:50.950
you can do the same thing.

49
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.830
Or you could use Apache or IIS or

50
00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.960
any one of about a dozen other
local web servers to run it.

51
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.414
The easiest is if you're on a Mac and
it's just built in or if you wanna go get

52
00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:08.200
Python from python.org and download it
because it's just a simple one liner.

53
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.790
But there are other options if you
decide you wanna go that route.
