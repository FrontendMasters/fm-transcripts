[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.935 --> 00:00:05.590
&gt;&gt; Kyle: All that was
a long preamble to say.

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.630
We wanna attach click
handlers to these two links.

4
00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:16.946
&gt;&gt; Kyle: And there's couple of
different ways that we can do that,

5
00:00:16.946 --> 00:00:22.000
but the easiest is for
me to say- you'll notice that there

6
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.010
is a control a js-controls wrapper
div around the two header links.

7
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.890
So if I were to find
an element by attribute, and

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.110
this is the syntax you use for
finding things by attribute.

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.150
We put brackets in, rel=js-controls.

10
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.040
What that means is go find
any element in the page

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.050
that has a rel attribute
whose value is js controls.

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:58.877
So I'm saying here go find
one of those and get me-

13
00:01:02.128 --> 00:01:06.256
&gt;&gt; Kyle: The child element, js-register.

14
00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:14.390
&gt;&gt; Kyle: It's a question about
rels having more than one element.

15
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.000
Yeah, as you'll notice here in my HTML,
I've got multiple rel attributes here.

16
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.600
And I only care about one of them,
it's the js-register.

17
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.720
All right, so
now I wanna say a child element

18
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.430
where the rel attribute has js control or
js registers somewhere in it.

19
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.207
So that is almost the same,

20
00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:43.390
&gt;&gt; Kyle: Except when you * = js-register,

21
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.310
that's one way of me getting at that link.

22
00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.981
You also might note that if I make js
register totally unique,then I don't even

23
00:01:53.981 --> 00:01:55.385
really need this part.

24
00:02:01.963 --> 00:02:06.179
&gt;&gt; Kyle: And if I want both of these links
to be attached with the same handler,

25
00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.810
which I do, I can use the compound syntax.

26
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.325
I can do a comma here and

27
00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:18.830
say, rel*= js-login.

28
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.697
So here I'm saying go get me an element
that has js register as its rel attribute

29
00:02:23.697 --> 00:02:27.117
and another one that has js
login in its rel attribute.

30
00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.350
&gt;&gt; Kyle: I know in my page there's
only gonna be one of each of those, so

31
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.199
I know I now have a collection
of only those two elements.

32
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.500
There's literally a half dozen other ways
that I can write that same line of code.

33
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.300
You also should have been provided
in addition to the js org,

34
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.730
you would have gotten the js
org solutions folder.

35
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.370
And you'll notice in that js org solutions
folder I have broken down tasks one, two,

36
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.550
three, and four.

37
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.090
Those mapped to the high level task
that we're doing in our read me.

38
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.620
So task one is the completed
form of this task.

39
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.610
Task two is the completed form
of task two and so forth.

40
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.665
So if I took a quick little cheat
peek at the solution file for

41
00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:18.590
header.js.

42
00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.530
This is another way of doing it, which is

43
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.200
I'm going to attach not even to the
controls but to the header element itself.

44
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:37.530
You notice in my index HTML, I also
have an element here called js-header.

45
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.840
And there's a thing called event bubbling,
which means if I click on something and

46
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.220
I don't have a handler on that,

47
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.110
the bubble will make that event fire
on any of its parent elements, too.

48
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.650
So I could take advantage of attaching
a click handler to the header element, and

49
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.690
these link clicks will just bubble up for
me, which is nice and convenient.

50
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.830
So that's actually the way I'm
going to prefer to do this.

51
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.680
But like I said, there's like a dozen
other ways that you could do it.

52
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you cover that?

53
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.280
What does that star mean?

54
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.757
&gt;&gt; Kyle: Star means find
it anywhere in the value,

55
00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:10.202
if you're gonna have multiple values.

56
00:04:15.585 --> 00:04:18.670
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So I'm instead going
to attach to the header element.

57
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.310
I'm going to attach a click
handler on click, and

58
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.940
I want to limit my clicks to only
ones that were on those js elements.

59
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.350
So if we come back to our index HTML, I
wanna limit it to js register or js login.

60
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.704
There is a couple different
ways of going about that,

61
00:04:42.704 --> 00:04:46.885
but the easiest way to go about that
is to give it a string that says.

62
00:04:58.024 --> 00:05:01.400
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So it just needs to be one
of the things that has a js- in it.

63
00:05:06.144 --> 00:05:10.970
&gt;&gt; Kyle: And actually I'm going to
slightly switch from my solution file.

64
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.634
I'm gonna go back to using
controls rather than header here.

65
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.213
&gt;&gt; Kyle: Finally,
we give it a click handler.

66
00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:37.948
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So, what we know inside to this
function is that if we get this function

67
00:05:37.948 --> 00:05:41.968
called, we know that one of our two links
was clicked, which is what we wanted,

68
00:05:41.968 --> 00:05:44.849
we wanna make sure that one of
our two things was clicked.

69
00:05:54.943 --> 00:05:59.060
&gt;&gt; Kyle: Now,
in terms of event management with jQuery.

70
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.540
You've probably, if you've had any
experience with jQuery before or you or

71
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.210
you've read Stack Overflow posts,
you've probably seen people

72
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.230
do things like return false,
which we don't want to do here.

73
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.440
So there's another way of managing
this event so that we handle it and

74
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.950
it doesn't bubble anywhere
do anything else.

75
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:22.710
And that's to call evt.preventDefault,

76
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.278
evt.stopPropagation, and

77
00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:32.949
evt.stopImmediatePropagation.

78
00:06:38.063 --> 00:06:40.179
&gt;&gt; Kyle: So that just simply means
that we're handling the event,

79
00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.826
we don't want it to bubble anywhere else,
we're gonna take care of it.
