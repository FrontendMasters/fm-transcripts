00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.059
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:05.960
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's
come back to our read me.

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.611
Check and see.

4
00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.058
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: So item number 4
suggested that we do exactly what I just

5
00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:14.200
talked you through.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.690
There's one last item.

7
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.730
This hopefully, is a much easier
thing to get your brain around.

8
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.100
But there's one last item to Task 3,
it says Refactor so

9
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.560
there's only one jQuery
document ready event, and

10
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.300
it should call the init method
of each of the three modules.

11
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.210
Suggests here that we
wanna add a new file.

12
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.355
So I'm gonna create a new file.

13
00:00:37.355 --> 00:00:39.235
I'm gonna call it for my purposes.

14
00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:42.250
app.js.

15
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.168
It should have a document
ready event in it.

16
00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.596
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Now inside of this code,

17
00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:58.780
I want to call all 3 of the initialization
methods for all of my modules.

18
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.920
So I have Header.init and

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.430
I do need the parenthesis here
cuz I'm calling the functions.

20
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.323
What's the next one I need?

21
00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:06.333
&gt;&gt; Student: Carousel.

22
00:01:06.333 --> 00:01:09.362
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Carousel.init
&gt;&gt; Student: And details.

23
00:01:09.362 --> 00:01:11.058
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: And Details.init.

24
00:01:13.386 --> 00:01:14.370
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: That wasn't that hard,
right?

25
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.613
The last step then is to go back
to those other modules, and

26
00:01:18.613 --> 00:01:21.510
take out that superfluous
(document).ready that was

27
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.001
hanging out at the bottom
of each of those files.

28
00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:35.907
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Does
everybody see how I did that?

29
00:01:44.474 --> 00:01:46.913
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: One last step,
I need to actually load app.js, so

30
00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:48.520
I need to add a script tag in here.

31
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.950
Now, you'll notice that small little
detail, this one needs to run.

32
00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.670
We need to be sure that this one runs
after these things have been loaded.

33
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.930
So, just to be really,
really sure that that's gonna happen,

34
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.070
it's not technically a big deal,
but just to be really, really sure,

35
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.158
I'm gonna put it at the end
of my script tags less so.

36
00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:10.743
App.js.

37
00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:25.150
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's
double check our work,

38
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.990
make sure that Task 3 is still
come completely functioning.

39
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.965
I did break something, what did I break?

40
00:02:35.672 --> 00:02:37.780
&gt;&gt; Student: You save something.

41
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:38.960
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Did I save
it to the wrong location?

42
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.710
I probably saved it to the wrong location.

43
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.845
Save As, yep,
I suppose save it in the JS folder.

44
00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:50.970
[LAUGH] Okay, so I made the mistake,
saved it in the wrong location.

45
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.410
Now I've saved it to the correct location.

46
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.190
Hopefully, Yup it uploads.

47
00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.766
Now this should work.

48
00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:03.520
The question was does
that order ever matter?

49
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.840
Sometimes.

50
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.340
Sometimes the order of things
that get loaded matters,

51
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.700
because JavaScript will run those programs
in the order that they are listed.
