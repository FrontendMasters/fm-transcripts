&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Wrapping things up for
this course.

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.593
In summary, I can simply say, if for
whatever crazy reason you've decided to

3
00:00:08.593 --> 00:00:12.845
make [LAUGH] your career centered
around JavaScript at this moment,

4
00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:15.919
doesn't it make sense to
know your JavaScript?

5
00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.143
Doesn't it make sense to be more curious,

6
00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:24.155
to ask more questions about it,
to want to know why the code works,

7
00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:28.739
so that you have any chance of
trying to fix it when it breaks?

8
00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.675
Doesn't it make more sense
to take it seriously, and

9
00:00:31.675 --> 00:00:36.046
read the spec every once in a while and
understand, and have a mental model, and

10
00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:40.683
most importantly through the understanding
of that tool communicate your ideas and

11
00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:42.470
your intent more effectively.

12
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.010
Thanks very much for
listening to my thoughts on JavaScript.

13
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.600
I hope that as you go forward,
you will continue that curiosity and

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.790
that inquisitiveness,
those asking questions.

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.250
Remember that I have lots of
materials out there to add to and

16
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.300
support this particular study.

17
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.410
The You Don't Know JS book series
is really a great resource.

18
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.020
All six books can be read up on GitHub.

19
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.130
Specifically, the three books from this
course would be the Scope and Closures

20
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.790
book, the This and Object Prototypes book,
and the Types and Grammar book.

21
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.600
So use those as your dig deeper
into these topics study guides

22
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.910
from beyond the course.

23
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.650
Thanks very much.

24
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.940
I appreciate you listening
to these thoughts.

25
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.269
