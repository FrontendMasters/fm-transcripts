&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's jump
into the this keyword, and

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.680
try to understand it a little
bit better through code.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.560
Let's write some code in this exercise.

4
00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.310
In this exercise you're gonna be
refactoring some code that currently uses

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.145
the module pattern, and you're gonna
instead make it use that namespace pattern

6
00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.340
where you have methods on an object and

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.630
they refer to the data properties on
that object using the this keyword.

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.359
So if we look at the ex.js you'll notice
that we have our module definition.

9
00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.560
We've got this defineWorkshop() function,
which is our factory function.

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.710
It's producing this publicAPI object and
it has these internal things,

11
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.730
these internal data values,
like currentEnrollment and studentRecords.

12
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.792
What we wanna do is turn the deepJS
from being defined by a function to

13
00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:49.358
being defined as an object
literal that has

14
00:00:49.358 --> 00:00:53.799
properties that reference
the currentEnrollment and studentRecords.

15
00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.585
And all of those functions, instead of
being hidden, they'll all be public

16
00:00:57.585 --> 00:01:01.150
methods on that object and they'll
all make references with this stop.

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.280
A word of caution, that there
are a bunch of places within this code.

18
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.990
For example, we pass in a callback
like this one right here.

19
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.220
We pass in this callback to .map.

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.640
When itâ€™s a regular lexical function,

21
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.690
the way it is in the module pattern,
no problem whatsoever.

22
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.540
But when we pass in this
to where functions,

23
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.360
we have the problem of our this binding.

24
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.580
So you need to make sure to watch out for
the places where you need

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.560
to pass in hard-bound references
to the methods, okay?

26
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.927
So the readme will give you
the instructions on taking out

27
00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:41.190
the defineWorkshop() factory,
replacing it with an object.

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.758
Change all those internal references and

29
00:01:43.758 --> 00:01:48.449
make sure that you use the bind where
it's needed, but don't use the bind on

30
00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:52.650
everything because it's not needed for
all of the function calls.

31
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.210
As always, if you get stuck and
need some help,

32
00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.430
make sure to look at the solution file,
the ex.fixed.

33
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.840
We'll be back in a few minutes
to talk through the solution.
