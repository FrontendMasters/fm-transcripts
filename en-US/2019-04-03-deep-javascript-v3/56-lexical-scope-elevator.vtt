00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:04.340
&gt;&gt; Kyle: One metaphor that I have used for
years that works well for me and

2
00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.257
maybe will work well for you.

3
00:00:06.257 --> 00:00:11.222
This idea of scopes being nested within
each other is similar to a building

4
00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:13.795
with a big tall elevator in it, okay?

5
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:16.544
Imagine if you went into a building and
you were looking for something but

6
00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:17.728
you didn't know where it was.

7
00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:19.410
You just knew it was
somewhere in the building or

8
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.763
probably somewhere in the building.

9
00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:22.614
You'd start on the first floor.

10
00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:24.261
You just do basically a linear search.

11
00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:25.976
Start on the first floor,
look for it there.

12
00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:28.767
And if you don't find it,
take the elevator to the next floor,

13
00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:29.616
look for it there.

14
00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:31.801
If you don't find it,
do that again and again and again.

15
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:35.697
And eventually you're gonna arrive
at the top floor of the building.

16
00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:39.932
And you either find it or you don't,
but there's nowhere else to go.

17
00:00:39.932 --> 00:00:44.719
So conceptually the first floor is our
current scope where the reference is,

18
00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.087
and the top floor is the global scope.

19
00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:53.796
&gt;&gt; Kyle: We'll come back to this
metaphor a later time in the course.

20
00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:56.832
So just kinda keep that in your
head if that works for you,

21
00:00:56.832 --> 00:00:59.000
this idea of going one floor up at a time.

22
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.174
We don't immediately jump to the global
scope, we just go one floor at a time.
