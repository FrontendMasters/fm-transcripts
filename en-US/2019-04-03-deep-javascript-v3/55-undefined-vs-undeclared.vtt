00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.150
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Let's make sure we're
fully clear on this whole undefined

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.210
versus undeclared thing.

3
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.350
Might be review for some of you but
let's just make sure we're fully clear.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.810
What is the difference between
undefined and undeclared?

5
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.752
Anyone?

6
00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.145
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're declaring
this variable exist,

7
00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:17.469
I'm not assigning it a value but it exist.

8
00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:19.212
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay, that's true.

9
00:00:19.212 --> 00:00:22.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
there it's declared but not defined.

10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.785
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Okay.

11
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:26.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undeclared.

12
00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:29.384
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: All right, that's part
of it, you're on the right track but

13
00:00:29.384 --> 00:00:30.620
that's not all of it yet.

14
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.492
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undeclared has have
never had the memory allocated during

15
00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:40.390
the compiler parsing
stage whereas undefined.

16
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.920
Maybe it was allocated but there's
never been a value assigned to that.

17
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.560
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Putting both of

18
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.730
your answers together we can
get the complete answer.

19
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.680
So let me restate that.

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.720
You are both correct.

21
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.990
You're on the right track so
let me restate this.

22
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.580
The difference between these two,
undefined means a variable exists but

23
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.190
at the moment it has no value.

24
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.640
It may have never had a value or it might
have used to have a value and it doesn't

25
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.280
anymore but there is no other value in the
vacuum of space it is undefined, right?

26
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.580
Undeclared even though they sound
like synonyms undeclared is actually

27
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.360
never formally declared in any
scope that we have accessed to.

28
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.100
That's what undeclared means.

29
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.869
We do not have a marble for it.

30
00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.439
And in strict mode, it always results
in those reference areas, okay?

31
00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.039
It's important to keep those straight.

32
00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.975
Unfortunately, JavaScript tries to
mess around with this and pretend that

33
00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:40.032
undeclared is sort of the same thing as
undefined and some of its error messages

34
00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:43.989
and other outputtings and things and
not is historically a really bad idea.

35
00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:46.280
We need to keep these
two concepts separate.

36
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.930
There's a different something
being undeclared doesn't exist,

37
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.640
and being undefine definitely it does
exist, but doesn't have a value.
