&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If you're curious
about TypeScript and Flow and

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.000
their differences, this is both
similarities and differences, but

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.510
especially differences, I found this
particular article to be very helpful.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.525
They went through essentially
both projects side by side,

5
00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:14.830
big long list of all
the different characteristics and

6
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.790
where they are the same, same, same, same,
and the places where they are different.

7
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.420
It's a good article, so
I'd recommend checking it out.

8
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.140
In summary, what I would say is that
TypeScript and flow are very useful in

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.610
that a lot of people are finding them to
be helpful to solve their typing issues,

10
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.020
helpful to make their types more obvious.

11
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.554
Where I find them to be frustrating or
maybe it's just me frustrated about

12
00:00:39.554 --> 00:00:44.910
the ecosystem is that we seem to jump
immediately to, that's the only option.

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.860
If you have types, you can either ignore
types entirely and use triple equals, or

14
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.670
you can jump to this other extreme,

15
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.790
which is layer on something
on top of JavaScript,

16
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.620
which I would argue is fundamentally
not really the DNA of JavaScript.

17
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.439
And I would like for
there to be something in between.
