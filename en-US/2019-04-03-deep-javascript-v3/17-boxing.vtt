00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.130
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I referenced a bit
earlier a sort of magical behavior like

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.520
accessing properties on primitive values.

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.640
Remember, you access a length
on a primitive string or

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.320
some method on a primitive number,
for example.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.960
So how does that work?

6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.030
How is it that we access the .length
of some string value here?

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.160
This DOM elements value
is always a string.

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.760
So how do we access that .length?

9
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.860
Well, it turns out that's called boxing.

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.700
It's a form of implicit coercion.

11
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.688
It's not called out in the same
way in the abstract operations.

12
00:00:37.688 --> 00:00:41.489
But I think it absolutely in
spirit is an implicit coercion.

13
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.260
It is saying you have this
thing that is not an object and

14
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.860
you're trying to use it
as if it is an object.

15
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
Me, JavaScript I'm gonna be helpful and go
ahead and make it into an object for you.

16
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.570
The only other option would be for the
JavaScript to throw an exception that said

17
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.235
you're trying to access
a property on an primitive value.

18
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.830
I am actually quite happy that JavaScript
implicitly coerces these primitives

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.700
into their object counterpart so that I
can access properties and methods on them.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.720
I think that makes
the code much more clear.

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.760
If I wanted to write code where I had to
turn a primitive into an object just to

22
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.310
use it, I'd go write Java.

23
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.300
This, I think,
is one of the unsung heroes of JavaScript,

24
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
that it does this boxing and
it does it well.

25
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.640
But it is an implicit coercion.

26
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.930
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that where

27
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.400
this notion of everything
is an object comes from?

28
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.270
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It is,
that's exactly what I meant when I was

29
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.870
talking in the intro, that people
think that everything's an object.

30
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.800
And it turns out that things
can behave as objects, but

31
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.160
that doesn't make them an object.

32
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.160
This is not an object.

33
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.250
It is a primitive string that has
an optimization in it where you can access

34
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.620
a property as if it was an object.

35
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.680
So these are all examples of coercion
that are happening in your programs.

36
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.520
And the larger point that I want to
make is whether we call them coercion or

37
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.830
we call them conversion every single
language in existence that you've ever

38
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.180
programmed in has to deal
with type conversions.

39
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.550
It is complete nonsense to
suggest that you can write

40
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.680
valid reasonable JavaScript programs and
not need to deal with type conversion.

41
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.910
You're always gonna have a string
that you need to treat as a number or

42
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.630
a number that you need
to treat as a Boolean.

43
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.931
You are going to have to deal
with conversions, aka coercion.

44
00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:24.192
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: It's
absolutely necessary, so,

45
00:02:24.192 --> 00:02:27.850
you're gonna use it whether
you're admitting it or not.

46
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.950
Cuz you really have no choice.
