00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.750
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: I believe JavaScript
can be divided into three cores,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.920
three pillars if you will.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.730
And those three pillars
are absolutely critical for

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.990
all of the JavaScript coding
that you will ever do,

5
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.900
even if it has the brand name React or the
brand name Vue.js or the brand Angular.

6
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.910
Guess what?

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.180
Or even for the old school folks like me,

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.020
even if it's jQuery it's still JavaScript,
okay?

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.630
And those things are still based
upon the same fundamental pillars.

10
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.808
And I see developers all the time, winding
themselves and contorting themselves

11
00:00:35.808 --> 00:00:39.573
around all kinds of certain weirdness
within their particular framework or

12
00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:41.838
utility whatever it is they're working on.

13
00:00:41.838 --> 00:00:46.142
And it turns out it's they don't
understand one of the pillars, or

14
00:00:46.142 --> 00:00:48.340
some part of one of these pillars.

15
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.308
And this course aims to fix that.

16
00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:55.216
I have this crazy notion that if for
whatever reason you've chosen you

17
00:00:55.216 --> 00:00:59.958
to make your career be a JavaScript
developer, if you've chosen to

18
00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:04.556
get paid to write JavaScript,
you oughta understand your tool.

19
00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:07.016
So what are we going to
look at those three pillar?

20
00:01:07.016 --> 00:01:10.997
The first of those pillars may be the
least popular of them actually definitely

21
00:01:10.997 --> 00:01:14.193
the least popular of them,
nobody likes to talk about types and

22
00:01:14.193 --> 00:01:17.633
especially within a dynamically
typed language like JavaScript,

23
00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.402
this is one of those taboo topics.

24
00:01:19.402 --> 00:01:24.755
If you follow a Doug Crockford, he tells
you don't use any of this stuff don't

25
00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:30.044
think about any of these things of course,
that isnâ€™t actually practical.

26
00:01:30.044 --> 00:01:34.270
And we're gonna talk about why
you should care about types.

27
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.680
But I will just go ahead and
spill the beans here.

28
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.890
The takeaway from this particular core for
this particular unit is,

29
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.870
it is irresponsible of
you to write code and

30
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.520
not understand this critical
fact of the language, okay?

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.220
It is irresponsible to say, well,
some good parts told me to just avoid that

32
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.800
topic, don't learn it,
don't need to worry about it.

33
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.660
That is one of the big reasons why
people produce bugs in their code.

34
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.530
They write code and they don't understand
the code that they're writing, okay?

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.390
So we're gonna cover the types and
specifically the coercion system.

36
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.640
Now, I'm gonna ask to have an open mind
on it because I know you have been so

37
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.640
programmed to think that we don't need
to do these things, we should only just

38
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.220
use the triple equals, and who needs to
care about it if we use the triple equals?

39
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.570
That is just not a practical
way of writing JavaScript.

40
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.340
You've been getting by,
and it's not effective.

41
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.730
So I'm gonna ask you to have an open
mind when I tell you, and maybe more so

42
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.600
than I have ever before,
I'm gonna have a very strong,

43
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.070
I'm gonna firmly plant my foot in
a position here about what you should be

44
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.060
doing with coercion, what you should
be doing with JavaScript's type system.

45
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.930
In the past I've sort of have views that
were kind of like well just make your own

46
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.950
sorts of decisions but I have come to
believe, my views have shifted and

47
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.780
I have to come believe there is
a correct way to think about this and

48
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.930
we're not getting there yet.

49
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.520
We're not there yet as a community.

50
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.040
So maybe one of the most important
things we can do in this course is

51
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.620
enlighten you to why that's so
important okay?

52
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.560
The second core unit that we're going
to talk about is the scope system.

53
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.130
Lexical scopes which leads us into
discussions about closure and

54
00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.299
eventually the modular pattern.

55
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.630
This is a critical pillar of the language.

56
00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.750
Almost everything else is built upon it.

57
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.400
And the third of the pillars
is the objects system.

58
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.160
I like to refer to this as the objects
oriented, a little bit different than

59
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.150
object oriented,
which is actually class oriented.

60
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.250
We need to understand how
JavaScript's objects system works,

61
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.400
which includes the this keyword,
that completely befuddling thing that's

62
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.890
actually very straightforward once
you've been taught what it does.

63
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.910
Once you disconnect from what
it does in other languages and

64
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.630
you learn what it does in JavaScript,
it's very straightforward.

65
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.630
So it's important for
us to understand all three of these cores.

66
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.420
And when we dig into this and

67
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.840
then we dig into the prototypes, you have
to understand that stuff before you can

68
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.280
understand somebody layering on top
a syntactic sugar like the class keyword.

69
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.030
I have not hidden my thoughts and
options online about the class keyword and

70
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.160
I will tell you again I firmly believe
that it should not be used in JavaScript.

71
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.110
But there is a difference between
me saying, you shouldn't use it and

72
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.220
me saying you shouldn't learn it.

73
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.220
You absolutely should learn this system.

74
00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.892
You absolutely must learn this pillar
to understand why that particular

75
00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:29.718
coding style doesn't fit with JavaScript
and to understand, by the way,

76
00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:32.551
if you are forced to do it,
how to do so well,

77
00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:37.660
if that framework makes that choice for
you and many of them have.

78
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.110
Can you still be effective or you're
simply gonna be coding with blinders on?

79
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.090
So these are the three core pillars
of the JavaScript language and

80
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.489
largely all of these pillars were
in place at the end of the 10 day

81
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.990
prototyping session that Brenda and
I put back in in 1995.

82
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.350
This is largely the JavaScript
that we've had now for 24 years.

83
00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.040
Yes, there are definitely
different details.

84
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.590
But many of these things are as core and

85
00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.620
root of a foundation as
it gets in the language.

86
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.780
At the end of this course which will
cover over a period of about two days,

87
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.550
it's going to feel a lot more
like we just went over five or

88
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.130
ten days worth of material because
it's extremely compressed.

89
00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.410
So I don't mean for you to come at the end
of this course and say, aha I'm certified,

90
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.650
I know everything there is to know about
JavaScript, this is not the end but

91
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.530
the beginning of what for

92
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.980
me has been over a 20 year
journey to understand JavaScript.

93
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.440
And I'm documenting for
you what I've figured out about the map.

94
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.560
I've tried to put together
a treasure map for my journey.

95
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.990
And I'm documenting that for you,
that's also what the books are.

96
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.410
So use those as companions here.
