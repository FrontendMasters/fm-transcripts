00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.120
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: What if you had
a really crazy call site like line 9?

2
00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.594
On line 9, I have a new keyword,
I have a workshop dot ask, so

3
00:00:08.594 --> 00:00:10.415
I have a context object.

4
00:00:10.415 --> 00:00:14.186
And I have dot bind, which under
the covers of course using apply.

5
00:00:14.186 --> 00:00:17.400
I have three of my four rules
matched on the same call site.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.830
I am not by the way suggesting you should
ever write a call site like that, but

7
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.420
it does actually work.

8
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.820
So why on Earth does it work, and
how does it know which thing to use?

9
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.490
If more than one rule matches a call site,
what's the order of precedence?

10
00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.508
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Well, there's a way
that you could convince yourself or

11
00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:43.657
prove to yourself what the order of
operations, or the order of precedence is.

12
00:00:43.657 --> 00:00:46.476
But I'm just gonna go ahead and
simplify, and tell you,

13
00:00:46.476 --> 00:00:48.550
this is the order to ask those questions.

14
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.020
So from here forward, if you ever need
to ask yourself what is my thisKeyword

15
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.470
gonna point out when this function gets
invoked, this is how you determine that.

16
00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:09.881
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The determination for
the thisKeyword is, number one,

17
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:12.375
was the function called with new?

18
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:15.405
If so, the newly created object
will be the thisKeyword.

19
00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:20.440
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: Number two, is
the function called with a call or apply?

20
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.880
And by the way dot bind is a sub of
that rule because it also uses apply.

21
00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.310
If so, the context object that
is specified will be used.

22
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:35.710
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If that doesn't match,
then number three,

23
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.375
is the function called on a context
object like workshop dot ask?

24
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.763
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: If so, use that object.

25
00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:47.776
And if none of those three have applied,
then we fall back to the default which

26
00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:50.760
says default to the global
object except in strict mode.

27
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.610
That's it, just those four rules in that
order, and it'll perfectly and completely

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.521
answer every question that you may have
about what does my thisKeyword point at?
