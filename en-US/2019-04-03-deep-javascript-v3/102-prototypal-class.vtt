00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: The same class syntax.

2
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.040
But this is like the underneath the sugar,
this is what the code would look like.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.540
This is the old school way of doing
a prototypal class, so called.

4
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.551
You notice that we have a workshop
function which is going to serve sort of

5
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.730
the purpose of the constructor.

6
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.601
And then we start adding methods
to the Workshop.prototype, and

7
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:26.440
we cog new calls and stuff.

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.510
So you see some of
the underpinnings of classes, but

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.980
this is the plumbing underneath what
is happening in the class sugar.

10
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.070
It's not that you would really write this
code anymore because if you wanted to do

11
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.030
classes at all you almost certainly
be using the class syntax.

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.400
You wouldn't write this prototypal code
anymore, but I think it's important for

13
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.850
you to understand how this plumbing works.

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.050
Where are the relationships?

15
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.870
Where are all of those linkages?

16
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.950
Since they're not copies and since
copying is actually a bad mental model,

17
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.340
we need a different mental model that
helps us understand how class works, how

18
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.310
it really works, so that we can understand
when it breaks, why did it break?

19
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.530
Why did it do something
different than what we expected?
