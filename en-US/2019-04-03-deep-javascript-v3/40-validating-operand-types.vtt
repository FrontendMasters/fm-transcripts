&gt;&gt; Kyle Simpson: One thing that I think
is undervalued within TypeScript this is

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.880
actually where many more
of my bugs have come from.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.970
It's that in addition to being able
to a static typing information about

4
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.910
variable assignments, it can also tell us
that certain operations would be invalid.

5
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.300
In this particular case, it's saying you
can't subtract a string from a number.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.720
Because that particular preference is
saying don't allow that coercion, and

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.790
in this particular case,
that would be a really useful help for me.

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.030
I would really like for

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.700
a linter to tell me, don't try to
subtract a string from a number.

10
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.250
What I'd really like is a linter
that let me have that, but

11
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.470
not let me have all the complaints
about all my static type assignments.

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.859
That would be my preference.

13
00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.039
But this is, I think,
an undervalued part of what they do.

14
00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:50.980
Is that they are actually allowing
us to check the operations that

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.385
we're doing where most of
our business logic is, and

16
00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.479
making sure that those
operations are valid.

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.830
It would be nice if TypeScript would have
some mechanism by which you could allow

18
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.180
some more coercion to occur.

19
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.584
Because there are plenty of places,
as I've already made the case,

20
00:01:06.584 --> 00:01:10.475
where I'd like to be able to do coercion
and other Places I'd like to avoid it.

21
00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:14.086
It appears to me in my research that
Typescript is kind of all or nothing.

22
00:01:14.086 --> 00:01:17.766
You opt into it or you don't opt into it.

23
00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:20.396
I'd prefer there to be more nuance and
configuration.
