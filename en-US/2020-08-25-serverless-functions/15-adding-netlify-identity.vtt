00:00:00.477 --> 00:00:05.557
So now that we've added this script,

2
00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:11.924
I'm gonna add in the netlify
identity button.

3
00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:15.992
And we can see that if we
look back at these docs here,

4
00:00:15.992 --> 00:00:19.885
that there is a netlify identity button,
right?

5
00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:23.845
And so, just gonna grab this, and

6
00:00:23.845 --> 00:00:29.179
let's bring it over and
drop it into our code.

7
00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.855
Drop it right there.

8
00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:38.027
And let's go and
take a look at it cuz we're rolling here.

9
00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:41.547
Yeah, that's not what I want.

10
00:00:41.547 --> 00:00:43.379
I don't want it to say that,
so let's just drop this out.

11
00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.413
I don't care about that part.

12
00:00:45.413 --> 00:00:46.523
There we go, now we got a login button.

13
00:00:46.523 --> 00:00:52.460
Okay, so I'm gonna log in, and
it's asking me for the site's URL.

14
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.621
So let me head over here and
just go back to our site.

15
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:03.261
And this link here, where it says
frontendmasters-serverless.netlify.app,

16
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:07.063
whatever site you just created,
that's the URL you're gonna use.

17
00:01:07.063 --> 00:01:11.699
So let's head back over here,
drop that in and set.

18
00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:15.599
And so what that's doing is it's
telling the local host where to hit

19
00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:18.761
to validate whether or
not somebody is an actual user.

20
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:22.880
That's because users have to
be managed somewhere else.

21
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.926
You can't local host manage your users or

22
00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.853
you wouldn't be able to actually
test the login and stuff.

23
00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:30.663
You need the authentication
server out there.

24
00:01:30.663 --> 00:01:34.853
So once we've done that,
I wanna sign up for my my site.

25
00:01:34.853 --> 00:01:40.665
So let's set a password
that I will remember and

26
00:01:40.665 --> 00:01:43.577
sign up for my account.

27
00:01:43.577 --> 00:01:47.037
Okay, we're signing up, here we go.

28
00:01:47.037 --> 00:01:50.054
And I'm gonna get a confirmation message.

29
00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:57.640
So off screen, I'm gonna look at my
email and that will give me my login.

30
00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.692
Okay, so when I come back out here,
I'm gonna paste that link.

31
00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:08.090
All right, now because we haven't pushed
the changes with netlify identity,

32
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.477
it didn't do anything.

33
00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:14.233
But we end up with this confirmation
token, and that's actually what I want.

34
00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.791
So I'm gonna come back to my local host.

35
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:20.233
And I'm just gonna paste this in and
hit it.

36
00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:25.799
And now I'm logged in,
my account is validated, right?

37
00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.135
So you just take that confirmation token
hash and paste that into your local host.

38
00:02:31.135 --> 00:02:35.094
And that way, you'll confirm your account.

39
00:02:35.094 --> 00:02:39.337
And then if I go back and look at my
Identity tab, I can see now I have a user.

40
00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:42.510
And my users created and
there's no role set.

41
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.551
So we'll talk a little bit
about roles in a minute.

42
00:02:45.551 --> 00:02:49.270
But for now, let's actually just look
at what happened when we did this.

43
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.243
So I was able to create this account.

44
00:02:53.243 --> 00:03:00.835
And so I've created a new account and
logged in.

45
00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:05.559
And now I have my user, I am a user.

46
00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:12.296
I've logged in and Netlify is
telling me that I'm authenticated.

47
00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:15.279
So I wanna see what that actually means.

48
00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.304
So we can just console log out here, and

49
00:03:18.304 --> 00:03:22.252
I'm gonna get the netlify
identity current user.

50
00:03:22.252 --> 00:03:26.893
And the way that I know what this is,
is from the docs,

51
00:03:26.893 --> 00:03:31.138
there are docs down here
on what we're getting.

52
00:03:31.138 --> 00:03:33.981
And I'm interested in this one here,
Current User.

53
00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:37.509
So I've logged out my current user.

54
00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:42.335
And inside of it, I can see a few things.

55
00:03:42.335 --> 00:03:43.553
Let's take a look at what's in here.

56
00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:46.475
So this is our API for identity.

57
00:03:46.475 --> 00:03:50.735
That's where we're asserting that
we have our identity server.

58
00:03:50.735 --> 00:03:57.024
We've got app metadata,
which is set by the app.

59
00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:59.120
I, as a user,
cannot control my app metadata.

60
00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.854
I can only control my user metadata,
so I could change my name, but

61
00:04:02.854 --> 00:04:04.734
I couldn't change my provider.

62
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:13.169
Then there's some information that comes
from the identity service that we don't

63
00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:18.749
really need to care about for this, like
the audience, that's not really for us.

64
00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:21.895
We can see what time I confirm my account,
and so

65
00:04:21.895 --> 00:04:24.662
how long it took me to confirm my account.

66
00:04:24.662 --> 00:04:30.198
We can see what my email address is,
what my identity user ID is so

67
00:04:30.198 --> 00:04:33.283
that I can be uniquely identified.

68
00:04:33.283 --> 00:04:39.040
Last time it was updated,
the URL and then this token.
