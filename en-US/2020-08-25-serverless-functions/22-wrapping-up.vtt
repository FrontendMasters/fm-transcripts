00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
The sky is really the limit.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.200
If you start thinking about the work that
you're doing on servers now with what

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.566
you're doing with your API.

4
00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:11.422
And you can even do things like if
you wanna run an express server,

5
00:00:11.422 --> 00:00:14.160
there's an express lambda server,

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.955
where you can set up an express
server as a server less function.

7
00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:23.078
So if you have a node app
that you wanna migrate over,

8
00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:27.500
an easy path could be to use
your Express app as a lambda.

9
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.697
You can do the same thing with
GraphQL like GraphQL serverless.

10
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:39.203
You can run a GraphQL endpoint on there,
I think it was actually called lambda.

11
00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:44.922
Yeah, so
you can deploy Apollo server Lambda,

12
00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:48.736
if you wanna run a GraphQL endpoint
off of a serverless function.

13
00:00:48.736 --> 00:00:53.846
There are a whole bunch of things that
you can do, and the limits start to be

14
00:00:53.846 --> 00:00:59.373
more around shifting your thinking to
serverless than around the practicality

15
00:00:59.373 --> 00:01:04.411
of it, it's definitely gonna work,
or almost definitely gonna work.

16
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:08.937
As a developer, I think I have to always
preface everything with well, it depends,

17
00:01:08.937 --> 00:01:11.255
there's a chance this isn't gonna work.

18
00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:15.312
But for the majority of use cases, for
the majority of things that we're doing on

19
00:01:15.312 --> 00:01:18.833
the web, for the majority of things
that we're doing with servers and

20
00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:23.072
processing data, there's probably a path
forward with serverless that would give

21
00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:26.021
you some opportunities to do
some really exciting stuff.

22
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:26.972
And in most cases,

23
00:01:26.972 --> 00:01:30.606
you'd be able to bring a lot of what
you're already doing to that world.

24
00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:33.630
You just get to eliminate a lot
of that server management.

25
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.683
You get to eliminate the boilerplate,
the DevOps, the routing and

26
00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:42.305
the kind of headache of configuration of
getting all of these things set up and

27
00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:43.460
tuned in scaling.

28
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.141
You get to skip past that part and
go straight to the fun part,

29
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:48.942
which is writing the logic and
making your apps do cool things.

30
00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:54.057
Because you're trusting a huge cloud
provider to manage all of that scaling and

31
00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:55.058
DevOps stuff.

32
00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:57.619
That's what they're good at,
they're the best in the world.

33
00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.197
They hire people and hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year to make this stuff work.

34
00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:05.965
So we can trust them to
keep that stuff running.

35
00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:10.573
And we can focus on the parts that make
our apps and our businesses function,

36
00:02:10.573 --> 00:02:12.307
the actual business logic.

37
00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:15.772
And that's why I think that's what
makes serverless such an exciting

38
00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:16.780
technology for me.

39
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.832
And why I think it's such a powerful thing
that we can do and use to really power

40
00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:26.811
up the things that we build and to unlock
some pretty exciting possibilities

41
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:31.982
without having to scale up to a full team
or multiple teams to build this stuff.

42
00:02:31.982 --> 00:02:36.682
You as a solo developer can use
this technology to build so much,

43
00:02:36.682 --> 00:02:40.608
to accomplish virtually unlimited things,
right?

44
00:02:40.608 --> 00:02:43.528
Because you're not having to manage so
many things.

45
00:02:43.528 --> 00:02:46.154
You're just writing some JavaScript.

46
00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:52.880
So I think that's what
got me excited about it.

47
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.029
And that's why it's what I kind of reach
for when I start building any new app.

48
00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.617
I'm looking at, use that jam
stack approach on the front end,

49
00:03:02.617 --> 00:03:05.743
try to limit the front end to
be just some static files.

50
00:03:05.743 --> 00:03:11.572
And for the API side, I wanna use
serverless functions for as long as I can.

51
00:03:11.572 --> 00:03:15.322
There are so many good cloud
based options for custom data.

52
00:03:15.322 --> 00:03:20.245
We use Hasura today, the examples
that I showed for stripe use fauna.

53
00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:21.764
Strapping is another good option.

54
00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:25.348
Sanity.io is another good option,
these cloud hosted kind of data or

55
00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:28.699
content management solutions
where they're really flexible.

56
00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:30.841
You can do whatever you want with them.

57
00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:34.526
And then there are all these specialized
software as a service platform,

58
00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:35.899
Stripe is a great example.

59
00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:38.020
They do one thing and
they do it extremely well.

60
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.456
And they do it through an API service.

61
00:03:40.456 --> 00:03:44.173
So we just use a serverless
function to talk to Stripe's API.

62
00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:46.304
We get amazing apps out of that.

63
00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:52.020
I think I've talked a lot about this.

64
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.195
I'm very excited about it.

65
00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:54.260
I don't know if you can tell.

66
00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.930
And I'm really, really excited to
see what you can build with it.

67
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.848
So if anybody has questions,
please hit me with them.

68
00:04:00.848 --> 00:04:04.520
If you don't have questions,
please send me your ideas.

69
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.759
I wanna know what you're gonna build.

70
00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:07.635
Send me the apps that you
build with this stuff.

71
00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:08.611
Because I wanna see it.

72
00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:10.327
I wanna see what you're coming up with.
