WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.373
And so now that we're able to
actually submit things and

2
00:00:03.373 --> 00:00:07.894
we're gonna show that response again,
which we can validate by, again,

3
00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:11.935
we're looking out here,
this response came back so we can see it.

4
00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:14.135
Now we can actually like handle these.

5
00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:18.735
So given that we've got the id title,
tagline and poster,

6
00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:23.070
let's build our variables object and
send off a query.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.061
And so the query that we're
gonna send off is going to be

8
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.652
just the same one that we wrote in here.

9
00:00:31.652 --> 00:00:34.361
So I'm gonna go copy it instead
of trying to write it out again.

10
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:40.159
So let me grab this mutation right
out of the Hasura console, all right?

11
00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.875
And I'm gonna bring it back over.

12
00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:48.489
And out here, we will, Oops.

13
00:00:50.054 --> 00:00:54.663
Set up a result and
that's gonna be awaiting query,

14
00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:57.508
I'll make this smaller again.

15
00:00:57.508 --> 00:01:03.313
So we're pulling in query from Hasura and
then we're gonna await a call to query.

16
00:01:07.053 --> 00:01:09.155
And this time we're
gonna include variables.

17
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.655
And our variables are actually
just gonna be id title,

18
00:01:14.655 --> 00:01:18.069
tagline and poster, so
we can put those in right away.

19
00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:20.665
Then we've got this query here,
I'm gonna paste that in.

20
00:01:22.374 --> 00:01:23.722
And we've got all these values.

21
00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:25.391
Now again, I don't really need that name.

22
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:28.462
So I'm just gonna drop it and
we're gonna stick with just that.

23
00:01:28.462 --> 00:01:33.101
Another thing that I don't want here is I
want this to fail if we leave it blank.

24
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:38.970
So I'm gonna change all of these
equals here to an exclamation point.

25
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.504
And what this means in GraphQL is that
we want this to be a required value,

26
00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:46.700
we have to provide a string.

27
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.680
And so if it defaults to null,
we actually don't want that,

28
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.045
we want it to say hey,
you forgot to give me a value.

29
00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:58.594
So once we have this result, right?

30
00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:04.406
This is gonna send it off and that's
gonna tell Hasura to save this entry.

31
00:02:04.406 --> 00:02:10.733
After that, all we have to do is
instead of sending back the body,

32
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:18.997
we can JSON.stringify, Result.

33
00:02:18.997 --> 00:02:23.581
Okay, so now, here's our moment of truth.

34
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.866
Let's try to save one of these movies.

35
00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:28.872
So I'm gonna open up here,
get into movies.json.

36
00:02:28.872 --> 00:02:31.412
Let's just take one of these across.

37
00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:35.079
So I'm gonna go into our form again.

38
00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.155
And I'm gonna put the ID in.

39
00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:41.373
I'm gonna grab the name, or do we already
put this one in, let me check real quick.

40
00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:43.065
I don't want duplicates.

41
00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:46.371
Data, let's look at movies.

42
00:02:46.371 --> 00:02:47.742
We already did Starship Boopers.

43
00:02:47.742 --> 00:02:49.180
All right, so let's move on.

44
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.252
We'll do this one.

45
00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:54.991
So I'm gonna put in the ID.

46
00:02:54.991 --> 00:03:01.777
We'll get the title,
we'll get the tagline.

47
00:03:01.777 --> 00:03:03.753
And then let's grab out this poster link.

48
00:03:05.927 --> 00:03:08.077
Okay, so these are our values.

49
00:03:08.077 --> 00:03:12.434
And what I want to happen is I want to
see a call go off to add movie, and

50
00:03:12.434 --> 00:03:16.047
I want it to report back 200,
so let's give it a try.

51
00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:19.713
There's our call to add movie.

52
00:03:19.713 --> 00:03:26.049
We can see that we inserted one movie and
we get back the movie that we inserted,

53
00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.993
and we can validate that
by going over to Hasura.

54
00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:34.317
And if we hit this Run Query,
it just looks for more data.

55
00:03:34.317 --> 00:03:37.329
There we go, our movies in.

56
00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:38.938
We've done it.

57
00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:43.852
So then we can go back
out to our homepage, And

58
00:03:43.852 --> 00:03:46.610
we'll see,
I'm gonna make this bigger again.

59
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.115
That movie has been added.

60
00:03:48.115 --> 00:03:51.934
Okay, so
now we're getting real close here, right?

61
00:03:51.934 --> 00:03:56.015
We're almost done because now what we've
got is we're loading data from a database.

62
00:03:56.015 --> 00:04:00.785
We are augmenting that data from our
database with third party API data,

63
00:04:00.785 --> 00:04:04.002
we're able to load in these scores and
ratings.

64
00:04:04.002 --> 00:04:09.981
Then we're now able to create new entries.

65
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:12.499
We can add our movies
from the website itself.

66
00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:15.721
Okay, so
we're almost all the way to a full app.
