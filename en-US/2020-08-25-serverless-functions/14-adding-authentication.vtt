WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.641
So the last thing that we wanna do
here is we want to add access control.

2
00:00:03.641 --> 00:00:09.069
I wanna make it so that you can only add
a new movie if you are logged in and

3
00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:14.140
not only if you're logged in,
but if you're an admin main user.

4
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.813
So we wanna make sure that only admins
in our system are able to log in or

5
00:00:18.813 --> 00:00:22.853
anybody can log in, but
only admins can create new movies.

6
00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:25.653
At this point, what we've done is we've

7
00:00:25.653 --> 00:00:30.545
moved away from the need to have
the movie stored in this local database.

8
00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:34.577
And instead,
we're pulling them from Azura, and

9
00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:38.722
we are doing that through
this form here at /admin.

10
00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:43.756
But at the moment, this form is not
it's not gated, it's not guarded.

11
00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:47.250
So if anybody finds this URL,
they would be able to come in and

12
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.588
just load up whatever movies they want.

13
00:00:49.588 --> 00:00:53.956
And clearly, we have a genre,
I got to start the server again so

14
00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:58.087
we can see it, but
we've got a style that we're going for.

15
00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:02.653
And so we wanna make sure that only people
who are willing to adhere to the the style

16
00:01:02.653 --> 00:01:05.424
guide for
our movies are able to update, right?

17
00:01:05.424 --> 00:01:10.158
So we're gonna create
the ability to protect content.

18
00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:14.497
And now the way that we're
gonna create that content or

19
00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:20.267
protect that content is we're going
to just add login support, right?

20
00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:25.475
So there's a page in the repo that
is in under source called login,

21
00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.268
and right now all it is, is styles.

22
00:01:28.268 --> 00:01:33.113
So we're gonna keep this simple, we're
just gonna add a big old login button.

23
00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:38.393
And the workflow that we want to happen
here is if you try to go to our admin

24
00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:44.113
page, and you're not logged in, we wanna
bounce you over to the login page,

25
00:01:44.113 --> 00:01:47.553
and require you to log in
before you can see it.

26
00:01:47.553 --> 00:01:50.465
After you're logged in,
if you go to the login page,

27
00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:52.547
we wanna bounce you to the admin page.

28
00:01:52.547 --> 00:01:57.667
So basically, we want these to act as
though they're kind of the same page.

29
00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:02.709
We are doing this strictly with
JavaScript today, we can also do it

30
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.309
using role based access control,
we can do it with a few other solutions.

31
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:10.243
But again,
this isn't a front end workshop,

32
00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:11.986
this is more about server less function.

33
00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:15.341
So we're gonna focus less
on controlling the UI and

34
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:17.768
more on controlling the functions.

35
00:02:17.768 --> 00:02:20.968
So the fastest way to get this done,
because we're already

36
00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:24.811
in the Netlify ecosystem is to use
something called Netlify Identity.

37
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:31.111
What Netlify Identity does is it will
give us, let's see, do I have it here?

38
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:36.641
Here, so Netlify Identity is it's just
kind of like built into our whole system.

39
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:39.776
And because we've already got
the Netlify dev stuff set up,

40
00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:42.245
we can actually just like deploy this,
right?

41
00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:46.407
So let's start by deploying
our site because identity

42
00:02:46.407 --> 00:02:51.210
requires us to have a live endpoint
to hit for authentication.

43
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.787
So to do that, I'm gonna make
sure that our site is up to date,

44
00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:57.474
let's go get status.

45
00:02:57.474 --> 00:02:58.505
Okay, we're good.

46
00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.327
Then I'm going to run Netlify init, and

47
00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:05.485
what this does is it lets us create and
configure a new site.

48
00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:08.596
So I'm hit this Create and
Configure button,

49
00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:10.918
I'm going to add it to my own team.

50
00:03:10.918 --> 00:03:14.634
And let's call this,
you can call it whatever you want, I'm

51
00:03:14.634 --> 00:03:18.938
gonna call it frontendmasters-serverless,
if I can spell it right.

52
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:23.997
And if you leave it blank, and just hit a
button, it'll autogenerate a name for you,

53
00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:25.481
so you don't even have to do that.

54
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:29.833
And then it's auto detected
our NMP run build, okay?

55
00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:34.381
And then I don't wanna use my full path,
so I'm just gonna use this site folder.

56
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:39.733
You can leave these default or leave them
blank, because they're actually being

57
00:03:39.733 --> 00:03:45.016
read out of the Netlify toml, and not
these settings here, but this lets us run.

58
00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:49.435
Now the exciting thing about this
is it Netlify run, Netlify open,

59
00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:52.313
it's gonna take us right to our dashboard.

60
00:03:52.313 --> 00:03:57.469
And I can see here's the site,
it's already building, and it's hooked

61
00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.812
up to GitHub, so it's gonna build
whenever we run off the main branch here.

62
00:04:02.812 --> 00:04:07.238
For this particular project, like if you
would wanna change it to whatever your

63
00:04:07.238 --> 00:04:09.564
default branches when you're pushing.

64
00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:12.605
But because I'm running it
off of a progress branch,

65
00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:16.534
which is not the default branch,
I'm gonna change that real quick.

66
00:04:16.534 --> 00:04:22.532
You don't have to, it should just
default to your main branch,

67
00:04:22.532 --> 00:04:25.762
so I'm gonna save it as progress.

68
00:04:25.762 --> 00:04:31.178
And then whatever we build in
progress is gonna deploy the site,

69
00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:34.907
and it should run from
the progress branch.

70
00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:39.187
So here it is, progress, and
it's just gonna build what we've built so

71
00:04:39.187 --> 00:04:42.285
far instead of the main branch,
which is complete.

72
00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:44.858
So in here, now I have my branch building,

73
00:04:44.858 --> 00:04:49.578
I'm gonna give that just a second to
complete, we can see it running through.

74
00:04:49.578 --> 00:04:53.449
Here it goes, build, build,
build, and it's done.

75
00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:01.988
And you can see it is uploading
our functions, where are they?

76
00:05:01.988 --> 00:05:05.742
We're just looking at it down here,
here we go.

77
00:05:05.742 --> 00:05:07.527
Five new functions to upload, so

78
00:05:07.527 --> 00:05:11.880
it already detected that we had serverless
functions and those are all running.

79
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.055
So we can go back out here, and

80
00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:20.266
now we've got our app is up,
it's not running.

81
00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:24.505
And the reason it's not running is that
we didn't set our environment variables.

82
00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:28.901
Which are in here, build and
deploy environment,

83
00:05:28.901 --> 00:05:32.692
and then I need to add
these variables here.

84
00:05:32.692 --> 00:05:36.535
So let me go ahead and

85
00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:42.187
add those from my .env file,

86
00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:45.814
and then this one.

87
00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:51.667
Okay, and this is a browser
extension that blurs that out,

88
00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:57.053
so that I can do these without
having to pull my screen or

89
00:05:57.053 --> 00:06:01.754
pull my viewer off screen,
then copy this one.

90
00:06:01.754 --> 00:06:07.084
So now that we've got these, you can
save them, and those are ready for us.

91
00:06:07.084 --> 00:06:10.132
And now let me show you something
that's really exciting.

92
00:06:10.132 --> 00:06:14.956
If I come down here and
I run Netlify dev again, check this out,

93
00:06:14.956 --> 00:06:19.795
it's pulling the environment
variables right from Netlify.

94
00:06:19.795 --> 00:06:23.059
So now we don't even need a .env file
anymore, we can just delete this.

95
00:06:25.602 --> 00:06:31.314
And now we've got access
to the data in there,

96
00:06:31.314 --> 00:06:34.253
so like we can use that.

97
00:06:34.253 --> 00:06:37.991
And what's nice about it
is that we've got this,

98
00:06:37.991 --> 00:06:42.441
when I go up here to Deploys,
I can trigger a new deploy, and

99
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:47.529
this will build, and I think it's
about 20 seconds for the site.

100
00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:53.214
Once this is done, we'll be able to
actually view this site live and

101
00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:55.320
be pulling data from it.

102
00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.975
There we go, we got a live site,
it's pulling from our database,

103
00:06:58.975 --> 00:07:00.490
we've got our sites here.

104
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.597
And if we wanted to,
right now we could go and add a movie.

105
00:07:05.597 --> 00:07:09.773
So we don't wanna do that yet, we wanna
make sure that that's protected, so

106
00:07:09.773 --> 00:07:13.585
we're gonna go back to our dashboard here,
and hit the Identity tab.

107
00:07:13.585 --> 00:07:16.874
Now I wanna just enable identity tab.

108
00:07:16.874 --> 00:07:20.189
And what I want with identity
is this just gives us a pretty

109
00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:21.720
simple way to have users.

110
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.680
And it's gonna be like
it uses JSON Web tokens,

111
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.752
which is if you're doing front
end authentication management,

112
00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:33.502
JSON Web tokens, or JWTs or JOTS,
depending on who's talking about them.

113
00:07:33.502 --> 00:07:37.015
They will be a really common approach for
this.

114
00:07:37.015 --> 00:07:42.180
You get those from Zero from Author,
from most OAuth solutions.

115
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:46.774
So the flow that we're using here,
we're using Netlify Identity, but

116
00:07:46.774 --> 00:07:49.712
this will apply to most
identity providers and

117
00:07:49.712 --> 00:07:54.025
you'll be able to deal with it,
using whatever platform you want.

118
00:07:54.025 --> 00:07:55.766
So now that I've got this,

119
00:07:55.766 --> 00:08:00.845
I'm gonna use something called the Netlify
Identity Widget to handle the login

120
00:08:00.845 --> 00:08:06.027
because we don't wanna build the front
end for this, we just wanna have it work.

121
00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:12.203
So I'm gonna grab this Netlify Identity
Widget, and down here at the bottom,

122
00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:17.084
I can pull in the Netlify Identity Widget
script from the CDN.

123
00:08:17.084 --> 00:08:20.892
So I'm gonna drop that
into all of my pages.

124
00:08:20.892 --> 00:08:25.186
So the index page, the only reason
that we're including this is so

125
00:08:25.186 --> 00:08:28.648
that we can validate accounts
when they get created.

126
00:08:28.648 --> 00:08:30.968
On the admin page, we're including it so

127
00:08:30.968 --> 00:08:33.901
that we can check to see
that somebody's logged in.

128
00:08:33.901 --> 00:08:38.225
And on the login page, that's where
we're actually doing all the work,

129
00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:40.538
so I'm gonna include it there as well.
