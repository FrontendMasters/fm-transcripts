00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.330
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Track
everything you do.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.740
Here's why I'm saying this.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.820
Let's say today you reach out to
sports engine for that intern role.

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.690
Also, it's a year ago,
you reached out to sports engine.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.450
It's now today and
you can't remember who you spoke to.

6
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.030
And for some reason you still don't
have the email in your outbox.

7
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.520
Keep track of what resumé you sent
to who on what day for what role and

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.470
where you found it at.

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.310
Because one day Jesse Howard won't
be working at sports engine and

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.370
she's got me working at SPSS commerce or
any other technology company in town.

11
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.120
And maybe you had a phone conversation
with Jesse and what really really well but

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.020
they didn't accept they didn't take
you for the role and that's fine.

13
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.600
But now your email to Jesse as hey Jesse,
you may not remember me but you and

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600
I spoke January of 2017 about the intern
role your head of sports engine then you

15
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.030
told me to stay in touch with me.

16
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.840
You will guess what I am.

17
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.870
Because I see now on your website at your
new company, you're looking for this.

18
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.999
She's going to get back to you.

19
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.550
What happens though is that we're always
looking for jobs today, today, today,

20
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.440
today, and we for get about.

21
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.890
And so will we in two years, in four
years, in seven years down the road.

22
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.030
Depending on where you live and
where you're listening to this

23
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.570
presentation I'm giving,
in Minneapolis-Saint Paul,

24
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.210
we always have what Minneapolis–Saint Paul
being a really large small town.

25
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.070
It's not six degrees of separation for
I always jokingly call it 2.2.

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.470
If you're a developer in town and
you're connected to Mark Obranski here at

27
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.870
Frontend Masters, you have access to like
a third of the community from the get go.

28
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.090
One person knows that many.

29
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.740
Or knows, right?

30
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.030
Could be very wide, not so deep sometimes.

31
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.430
Because here's the thing,
that person who's saying no to you today,

32
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.790
that CTO who is saying no to you today
will be at a new group in six years.

33
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.070
Don't lose track of these folks.

34
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.210
Remember, write it all down.

35
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.370
Plus, the other reason is this.

36
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.890
The last thing you want to do have Jesse
from sports engine call you up a little

37
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.980
out of the blue and ask you to talk
about that role and you don't remember

38
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.435
sending your resumé to them because
those conversations suck really bad.

39
00:02:03.435 --> 00:02:06.216
You're who, about what?

40
00:02:06.216 --> 00:02:08.532
Actually happened to
me three weeks ago and

41
00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:11.580
I'm like the conversation
didn't last four minutes.

42
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.540
I was like how do you
not keep track of this?

43
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.480
I judged that person.

44
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.450
They probably could have been
really awesome, but I'm like,

45
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.640
if you can't remember this one thing,
what else don't you remember?

46
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.020
I don't like to be that judgmental but

47
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.280
on things like this I am
to keep track of folks.
