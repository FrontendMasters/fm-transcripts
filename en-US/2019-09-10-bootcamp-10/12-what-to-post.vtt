00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:01.456
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
what normally happens,

2
00:00:01.456 --> 00:00:04.147
people say, well,
what do I do as a status update online?

3
00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:08.216
Any of these things is a start, right?

4
00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:10.407
So I'm going to be attending an event or
a conference.

5
00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:10.936
I'm going to tweet that out.

6
00:00:10.936 --> 00:00:12.721
I'm probably going to
put it on LinkedIn too.

7
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.281
The reason is, if I'm going to
an event that I don't know anyone,

8
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:18.903
but I'm going saying,
I'm going to the event.

9
00:00:18.903 --> 00:00:20.559
I'm using the event hashtag.

10
00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:22.119
Someone may reach out to me.

11
00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.674
I may say, hey, I'm going to whatever
event and I don't know anyone,

12
00:00:25.674 --> 00:00:26.455
who's going?

13
00:00:26.455 --> 00:00:28.863
Surprisingly, right,
six people reach out to you going hey,

14
00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:30.005
I don't know anyone either.

15
00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:35.656
You already found your tribe, before
you leave your town to go to the event.

16
00:00:35.656 --> 00:00:38.761
Okay, seminars, webinars,
industry articles, I do this.

17
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:41.737
This is actually most of what I tweet out.

18
00:00:41.737 --> 00:00:46.868
If you follow me on Twitter most of
my stuff consists of Minneapolis, St.

19
00:00:46.868 --> 00:00:51.945
Paul tech news, some stuff from
the Midwest, sunset or moon photos.

20
00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:54.728
And sometimes go for football stuff.

21
00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:58.187
But we're not so great this year so
I'm not tweeting as much as I normally do.

22
00:00:58.187 --> 00:00:59.320
Until the Badger game,

23
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.617
in which case you might wanna follow
me cuz it could be entertaining.

24
00:01:02.617 --> 00:01:07.147
But I will infrequently though,
answer someone's question.

25
00:01:07.147 --> 00:01:08.801
And I did it as a tweet earlier today.

26
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.203
Hey, I'm doing this
presentation here today,

27
00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:14.141
what would be one bit of advice
you'd want to give someone?

28
00:01:14.141 --> 00:01:17.087
Normally, people don't respond right away,
but

29
00:01:17.087 --> 00:01:21.756
I'll get responses over the next two or
three days that often turn to a blog post.

30
00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:26.722
I spoke at Frontend Masters
beginners boot camp.

31
00:01:26.722 --> 00:01:28.335
Here are the topics we covered,

32
00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:31.877
here were the questions that people
wanted to know about afterwards.

33
00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:34.323
And here's a blog post and here's
a blog post, and here's a blog post.

34
00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:38.975
I could do that on LinkedIn instead.

35
00:01:38.975 --> 00:01:42.518
Does tying this up,
is this making a little sense at least?

36
00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:45.109
How to weave it all together?

37
00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.356
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, and I will say in
the tech industry, software development,

38
00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:53.864
I agree with you
wholeheartedly on Twitter.

39
00:01:53.864 --> 00:01:58.169
I'm on Twitter monitoring that
stuff all day, every day.

40
00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:01.525
Sharing links on-
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: People will say,

41
00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.754
how do I solve this problem?

42
00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:07.331
If you can't figure out how to
solve a problem, put it on Twitter.

43
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:10.736
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a lot of that
bootcamp attendees online that were

44
00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:14.636
tweeting at Jenn, at Brian, and
there's high fives and lots of.

45
00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:16.482
So we're all paying attention.

46
00:02:16.482 --> 00:02:18.693
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: And also, very cool
if you're an introvert, because then,

47
00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:20.188
you don't actually have to see anybody.

48
00:02:20.188 --> 00:02:22.450
[LAUGH] I'm a little
funny when I say that.
