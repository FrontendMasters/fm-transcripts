00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.720
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Code every damn day.

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.578
I'm going to add damn,
code every damn day.

3
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.440
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I don't code, I
mentioned this to you 12 days ago, right?

4
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.182
But I know that coding is a muscle
that you have to use every damn day.

5
00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:22.160
I see it with folks who

6
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.356
like go through boot camps a lot, they've
been through a 14 week intensive course.

7
00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:28.990
They end it on a Friday,
they wake up Monday morning and

8
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.110
they're completely like, what do I do now?

9
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.820
Because for 14 weeks someone was in
their head telling them what to do, and

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.910
that's fantastic, and it's great.

11
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.480
You gotta go do your job now and
you gotta keep working on your project and

12
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.800
you gotta find a nonprofit to work with
and you gotta try find it, every damn day.

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.090
So work on your own projects.

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.100
If you can't come up with a, you have to
find a project of your own that's going to

15
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.620
carry you through the days when you can't
figure out if something works or not.

16
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.160
Your own thing will carry you
more than almost anything else.

17
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.630
Go find an open source project
you can contribute online.

18
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.332
You want to learn how to code fast?

19
00:01:03.332 --> 00:01:07.261
Do it with a bunch of people
that know what they're doing.

20
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:09.487
They will take you on if you're
honest about what your skill and

21
00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:10.375
ability is, what it is.

22
00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:13.100
Find an open source project
you're jacked up about.

23
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.921
So now you're willing to put in the extra
free time cuz you're volunteering.

24
00:01:20.065 --> 00:01:22.148
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: But now you're
putting that on your portfolio and

25
00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.222
website, you're putting that on
LinkedIn and you tweeted out about it,

26
00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:28.962
because you're working with that
super cool developer from Netflix.

27
00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:30.770
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Is how
you make this go faster.

28
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.770
Volunteer with a nonprofit.
