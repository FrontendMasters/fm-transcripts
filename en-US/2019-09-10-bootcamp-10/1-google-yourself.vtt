00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.360
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: The second
thing I'm gonna do and

2
00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.130
some of you will probably do it now
while I'm speaking and that's just fine,

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.360
I'm going to go Google me so
I know that 85% of recruiters and

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.270
HR professionals will admit that when we
see job seekers or candidates online that

5
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.790
we're going to go find out more info
about them, the other 15% are lying.

6
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.690
They just don't wanna get sued.

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.130
But all the survey say,
recruiters, HR managers, and

8
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.750
I do it every day, just so you know,
if a candidate applies for a role,

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.080
I am really saying, okay, like what's the
LinkedIn profile, they also want to it or

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.250
wonder what they've been tweeting about.

11
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.960
And for me, I'm always trying to
include people into the job search.

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.850
Some people gonna try to exclude
you from the job search.

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.080
So tomorrow you will find
on Twitter that I will have

14
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.650
been at a tailgate for
the Gopher football versus Purdue game.

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.770
It's gonna be a little chilly tomorrow.

16
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.730
Undoubtedly, there is going to be
a photo of me and some something could

17
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.956
be fireball [LAUGH], could be some rumble
mins and hot chocolate like something.

18
00:01:02.956 --> 00:01:06.190
Undoubtedly, we're gonna a photo
like me with a beer in my hand.

19
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.550
That's cool.

20
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.510
I wanna make sure though that
if I'm now going out and

21
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.380
doing a job search networking with tech
professionals reaching out to a CTO,

22
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.190
that they don't see the photo
from college, that other photo.

23
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.850
That one when you were like
after the game, after the party.

24
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.400
It's now 3 o'clock in the morning,
walking back from Taco Bell.

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.780
I wanna make sure that they're
not gonna see those photos.

26
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.280
So I'm gonna Google myself.

27
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.484
I'm gonna log out of Google.

28
00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:31.760
I'm gonna make it so
that it's not doing my search preferences.

29
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.820
Log out, I'm gonna do an Incognito Window.

30
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.300
Like I wanna pretend I'm
the HR director at 3M, Google,

31
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.620
Facebook, Microsoft, wherever it might be.

32
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.460
What are they gonna find out about me?

33
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.640
So I need to find out, I learn from that.

34
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.970
Do I need to take anything
off of my online identity?

35
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.350
For my friends and I,
we have rule, two beer rule.

36
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.929
It's football.
We're gonna have a couple of beers

37
00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:56.300
before the game.

38
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.830
Three or more beers, we put the phones
away, so that should really

39
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.750
be going forward, sort of your rule
if you don't already have one.

40
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.680
It's called a show that
you have personality.

41
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.140
It's called a show that you have
outside interest beyond tech.

42
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.040
But we don't need to show them all
the things you're doing outside of

43
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.710
the world of tech.

44
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.091
So some of the things you have
posted on Facebook that I can find,

45
00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:19.468
you wanna lock that down if you can for
a while.

46
00:02:19.468 --> 00:02:25.593
I know there are sites that will freak you
out is if you go to pipo.com, P-I-P-O.com,

47
00:02:25.593 --> 00:02:31.330
type in your name and your like and it
could be Alabama, Minnesota, Pennsylvania.

48
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.600
Undoubtedly, you're going to find
things about you that you forgot about.

49
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.910
So if I go to pipo.com,

50
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.769
search my name, I find my address
from when I was six years old.

51
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.841
Now a couple of you just cringed.

52
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:48.472
I know a couple you're like, shit, see,
a couple of your smiling now too like,

53
00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:52.463
okay, now let's really figure out
what it is that someone might find.

54
00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:56.325
I wanna know all of that info
before someone else is going to so

55
00:02:56.325 --> 00:02:59.691
I would do that this weekend
early part of next week.

56
00:02:59.691 --> 00:03:01.385
Some of you are doing it right now,

57
00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:05.780
[LAUGH] that's quite okay with me,
cuz I wanna figure out if I can find me.

58
00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.070
Can I find my LinkedIn profile,
can I find my Twitter account?

59
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.980
And I mean this in a good way now.

60
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.692
A couple of you are smiling now by
the way looking at your keyboard,

61
00:03:15.692 --> 00:03:17.820
you're like how do they know?

62
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.628
Welcome to the Internet.

63
00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:22.323
But I wanna be able to figure out people
are gonna be able to find me because

64
00:03:22.323 --> 00:03:26.445
you're a couple statistics for 35% of
employers are less likely to interview

65
00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:28.400
a candidate they can't find online.

66
00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.920
So 10 years ago, is roughly 10 years ago,
11 years ago when Facebook made it so

67
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.011
that anyone, it wasn't just college
university, let's call it 10 years ago.

68
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.190
Back then it was weird if a recruiter or a
HR, personal hiring manager would look for

69
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.890
you online.

70
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.230
Now if I can't find you online,
I get freaked out.

71
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.380
If I can't find some high school
photo of you with a French horn,

72
00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.840
from a junior in high school, if I can't
find that photo of you being outside on

73
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.900
skateboard roller blades, whoever it was
when you were ten, that's weird to me now.

74
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.110
It truly is.

75
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.148
And so what we're gonna talk a little
bit about, like how to have an online

76
00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:14.336
presence, but I just kinda wanna give
you some sense of this is the reaction.

77
00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:17.750
So I wanna make sure I can be found and
there are more stats about this.

78
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.740
So it cuts both ways.

79
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:26.840
If I can find things out about you online,
I am more likely to speak with you and

80
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.152
of course the cuts the other
way too is I might not.

81
00:04:30.152 --> 00:04:33.650
There are lots of positive reasons
to be having an online website.

82
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.489
We're gonna talk about that,
to have a presence online,

83
00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:38.367
to have a LinkedIn profile, to be on
Instagram or Twitter if you want to be.

84
00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:40.147
There's lots of reasons to do it.

85
00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:41.857
We're gonna focus on those.
