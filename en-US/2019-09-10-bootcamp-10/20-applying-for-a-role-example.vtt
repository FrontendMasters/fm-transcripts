00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.853
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So this is
an example from more than a year ago.

2
00:00:03.853 --> 00:00:06.427
And then I'll do another live one here in
a second because it turns out it ends up

3
00:00:06.427 --> 00:00:07.292
being SportsEngine too.

4
00:00:07.292 --> 00:00:09.008
In town here,
there's a company called SportsEngine.

5
00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.349
It was a startup six,
seven, eight years old.

6
00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.666
I don't even know how old it is now,

7
00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:17.236
was acquired by NBC Universal Sports
a year or two ago.

8
00:00:17.236 --> 00:00:19.497
They had posted for
a software engineer intern.

9
00:00:19.497 --> 00:00:21.423
Clearly this was a pretty cool gig for
someone to get.

10
00:00:21.423 --> 00:00:23.348
They were only going to hire one.

11
00:00:23.348 --> 00:00:27.141
And what happens is, is on the left-hand
side, I know I cut it off, but

12
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:28.162
it says apply now.

13
00:00:28.162 --> 00:00:30.731
So if I were coming out of this,
or if it's in six weeks or

14
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:34.084
six months I'm feeling comfortable,
I'm going to click on Apply Now.

15
00:00:34.084 --> 00:00:36.964
I'm gonna go through whatever
process they want me to go to.

16
00:00:36.964 --> 00:00:40.744
And then I'm gonna take that search
string that I showed you earlier and

17
00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:44.276
I'm gonna figure who was an HR
recruiter person at SportsEngine.

18
00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.888
The fourth one on that list, Jesse Howard.

19
00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:48.260
What was her title then?

20
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.035
I can't even read that.

21
00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:52.640
I need to get some glasses,
Talent Manager.

22
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.556
I'm not going to email the VP
of HR at SportsEngine,

23
00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:58.025
because they're a 500 person company.

24
00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.300
But the talent manager at SportsEngine
is problem good person to reach out to.
