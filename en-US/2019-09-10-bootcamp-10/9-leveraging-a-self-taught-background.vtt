WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.959
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: And so part of her
by the way, for those who are self taught

2
00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:06.712
in your education section and by the way,
would I add front end masters to week

3
00:00:06.712 --> 00:00:10.260
beginner boot camp in my education
section of my LinkedIn profile?

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.880
Yes.

5
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.970
Absolutely.

6
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.840
If you're taking online
courses absolutely and yes.

7
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What
are companies looking for

8
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.770
in self learners as we
don't have a CS degree?

9
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.460
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Yeah.

10
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What would
companies consider,

11
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.800
what would they be looking for
when considering?

12
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.730
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Usually it's
going to be things like and so

13
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.300
what we'll take a pause and LinkedIn part
because I'm guessing this is going to

14
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.180
be a majority of the people who are trying
to be able to figure out how do we tell

15
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.830
an employer why they should hire me, but I
didn't go to Stanford University Minnesota

16
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.900
or University Wisconsin or
didn't go to a cool school in London.

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.890
Right.

18
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.510
The idea is this, is that self learning

19
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.870
is actually many people industry will
consider self learning to be harder.

20
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.390
You are actually the one who's going
on figuring out the curriculum.

21
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.050
You're the one learning
this stuff on your own.

22
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.130
You're the one.

23
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.130
You just have to be able to say I wanna
learn technology because I wanna go do

24
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.550
these things.

25
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.480
And I wouldn't just say you want
to make the world a better place.

26
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.390
Like what's the one part of your world
that you want to make a better place?

27
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.520
Okay, so employers are looking for
those who have learned something.

28
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.010
They put it on GitHub.

29
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.800
There are now three, they can show,
kind of like going back to your website.

30
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.920
It used to be this, now it's this, and
this is what I'm going to work on for

31
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.700
my next feature.

32
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.110
I wanna know that you're taking the stuff
that you're learning online and

33
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.740
what you've actually done with it.

34
00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.570
Like it can be a really rudimentary
app in the beginning, that's okay.

35
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.900
But then you added four more features,
and I can look at GitHub and

36
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.340
I can see what you did and
it's on your portfolio on your website.

37
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.750
And now you're telling me a story.

38
00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.830
And that's one of the themes
that will happen and

39
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.649
we get a little bit further into this.

40
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.960
Again, I'm an introvert but
I have gotten fairly well to learn

41
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.340
how to tell my story this is who I'm, this
is what I do, this is why I'm doing it.

42
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.710
As a quick side note,
I started recruiting 21 years ago so

43
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.070
last year when it was 20 years my
non recruiter friends were like Paul

44
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.600
that's amazing way to go, yay rah rah.

45
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.330
My recruiter friends like why the hell
are you still doing this after 20 years

46
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.850
people are crazy.

47
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.450
Like, yes you are.

48
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.080
But the idea is this is that when I tell
people that I actually really like to hear

49
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.700
people's stories, I want to figure
out how to help companies grow teams.

50
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.620
And I want to figure out for job seekers
what it is that they're looking for, and

51
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.920
put them in the right role for them.

52
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.400
People go,
now I understand why you're doing this.

53
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I would just add
that it seems like the current

54
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.190
atmosphere is less about what
college did you come from.

55
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.710
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In the past it would be like

56
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.140
a hard requirement.

57
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.920
But it seems like if people see that
you've actually built something

58
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.600
that takes away the education question.

59
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.500
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
this is the part about proving it.

60
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.670
And this why your website,

61
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.120
getting your domain name,
showing these updates on LinkedIn matter.

62
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.720
Show people what you've done.

63
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.070
I created this thing, we went from here,
to here, to here, to here, okay?

64
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.820
I now know you wanna learn.

65
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.620
You're motivated.

66
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.280
You can pick up new technologies quickly.

67
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.030
Has now wiped out 80% of the objection
if you don't have a college degree.

68
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.640
Okay.

69
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.790
So for a long time on the west coast in
the valley right it was if you didn't have

70
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.780
a degree from like 17 institutions you
were hosed, you were not going to be.

71
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.140
They've actually now proven that
in many cases it doesn't matter.

72
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.370
You may have a better network you may have
learned from a couple of professors that

73
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.580
taught internet of things
better than you get.

74
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.430
There are some advantages, but
not the way it used to be perceived.

75
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.940
Here's the other thing
about self learning.

76
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.530
Whether you're self learner and your
learning here from [INAUDIBLE] masters and

77
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.070
you're learning from other courses online.

78
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.080
You can't stop learning.

79
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.470
There's one thing I can
say to you right now.

80
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.470
Don't stop.

81
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.300
Don't stop learning
the next thing here is why?

82
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.248
How long ago did iOS
code get written Mark,

83
00:03:59.248 --> 00:04:00.682
do you know off the top of your head?

84
00:04:00.682 --> 00:04:03.145
Call it.
&gt;&gt; Mark: 2010.

85
00:04:03.145 --> 00:04:04.125
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So eight years.

86
00:04:04.125 --> 00:04:05.955
So this is how I used to do it.

87
00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:08.705
I used to have a blackberry
now I have one of these.

88
00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:11.995
I need a new one of these by the way,
this one's about three years old now.

89
00:04:11.995 --> 00:04:15.465
The idea is this is it,
there's gonna always be a next thing.

90
00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.295
Right?
There's gonna be a new thing that's

91
00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:19.735
going to change our world.

92
00:04:21.225 --> 00:04:23.230
You never stop learning.

93
00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.790
Okay, so just commit I would say to
you raise your right hand now and

94
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.840
do it all over again, but
I won't make you like take an oath again.
