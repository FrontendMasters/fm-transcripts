00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.350
&gt;&gt; Pete DeBettignies: So I'm gonna go
tonight during happy hour or hamburger,

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.910
whatever y'all are gonna do, or
tomorrow on my plane back home, or for

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.360
those of you who are in the Minnesota
area, I'm gonna hop on, pick a registrar,

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.390
GoDaddy or whatever, and
I'm gonna go get a domain name for

5
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.620
myself if I already don't have one.

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.320
So I picked up mnheadhunter.com in
2005 cuz I started writing my blog.

7
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.280
And I didn't know what to call it back
then I figured since I was a Minnesota

8
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.464
headhunter I was a rocket scientist what
all I should get mnheadhunter.com right?

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.670
Then a friend of mine about
nine months later was like,

10
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.640
did you get minnesotaheadhunter.com
like no why would I do that?

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.460
I should probably go do that.

12
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.475
So then I picked up.

13
00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:42.560
I now have but
I want to get my domain name.

14
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.670
Okay, usually it's going to be I got,

15
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.800
I got mnheadhunter.com because
no one can spell or pronounce.

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.610
Right, It's not an easily searched word.

17
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.370
But if I can get first name, last name,

18
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.500
last name.com,
I got tossed in the middle initial.

19
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.410
If there is something about you that has
been with you during your lifetime that

20
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.510
you want to be known about,
it could be some of you might form an LLC.

21
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.560
And become an independent contractor in
the next months or a year, I would go and

22
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.210
get that domain name,
like right away, okay.

23
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.330
The idea in I have this funky
little bike tire there.

24
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.910
The ideas you need to find a hub for
you online, right.

25
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.320
So, whether it's your future business
card, if it's anything where you're going

26
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.110
to be public you want people to go to
one place and then spoke out from there.

27
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.780
For some of you it actually will end up
being just LinkedIn and that's okay too.

28
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.750
But you are now front end web developers.

29
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.080
You are not entry level.

30
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.410
You are now a junior developer,
you're a front end developer, so

31
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.570
you you will be able to
make your own website.

32
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.570
I would caution you with this, so
many people create their own website and

33
00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.860
then forget about it for two years.

34
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.360
And then I'm judging you on the thing
that you built two years ago.

35
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.500
Make sure that you're
updating these things.

36
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.980
Okay?
We unfortunately make some

37
00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.080
snap judgments now and again,

38
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.740
so if you're really talented front end
developer and you're saying on LinkedIn,

39
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.460
your resume, you can do all your things
and I go to your website, and it sucks.

40
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.130
Just be cognizant of that
as you getting into this.

41
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.400
But the idea then is from there though,
then you've got links to LinkedIn and

42
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.270
GitHub and Twitter, contact me more
stuff about your portfolio and

43
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.690
the sites that you've helped to create.

44
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.280
You need to find a presence
online that you own.

45
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.090
So I'm gonna talk a little bit
about building a portfolio.

46
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.800
You and I were talking earlier about
the changes you've made to your website

47
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.810
just while you've been here.

48
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.780
And I would strongly encourage you
all to do the before and after stuff.

49
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.460
So if you didn't get the photos before
since I gave you this brilliant advice,

50
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.400
you could screenshot how
your website looks now and

51
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.130
view it again now two weeks from now,
six months ago whatever it's going to be.

52
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.900
And you can start showing
people here's how

53
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.920
I as a junior developer
have expanded my horizons.

54
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.640
This is how I took what was and
turned it to something else.

55
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.330
Because you're going to need to I
don't wanna use the word prue but

56
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.320
validate to a future employer
that they want to hire you.

57
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.500
And if you could say, well,
this is the before and this is the after.

58
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.120
Okay, I want you to be able to do that.

59
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.440
So take screenshots for those of you
who already are into building websites,

60
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.149
like get the metrics of those websites.

61
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.040
For those of you who will be doing it and
so

62
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.570
18 months from now you made a new feature,
you did a new thing to the website and

63
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.430
traffic went up 17%,
12% whatever it might be.

64
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.360
Average time on the website went from
45 seconds to three and a half minutes.

65
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.540
But document this stuff will show you how
to do that a little while though, okay?

66
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.120
Because you want to be able to make it so
that when you're doing your resume your

67
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.130
LinkedIn profile for your interview
that you're going to have one day.

68
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.090
Because I did this,
this result happened and

69
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.520
this is the impact it had on a business's
bottom line, increased cost.

70
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.900
Don't do that one, increased costs,
increase sales cut costs,

71
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.330
we increased the email newsletter by 17%.

72
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.550
Right, make us that you could document
these things that you've been doing so

73
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.940
that you can show a future employer.

74
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.530
But that idea of you created a feature.

75
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.384
And this is how it was, this is how it
has changed you have four screenshots.

76
00:04:17.384 --> 00:04:19.850
Employers are going to dig on that
stuff in the very beginning because

77
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.820
these are things you're going to rely on.

78
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.350
Because you don't have a seven
year track record yet.

79
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.850
Okay.
