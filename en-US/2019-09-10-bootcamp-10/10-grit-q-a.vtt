00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: In your experience, what did
successful candidates do from unsuccessful

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.830
ones when you break into the market
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Successful

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.520
ones versus unsuccessful ones.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:12.950
You have to be a little aggressive.

5
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.510
You have to be motivated.

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.480
You have to have an intestinal
fortitude and be cool being told.

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.870
No a lot.

8
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.105
Until you get the first job.

9
00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:22.250
By the way that sucks.

10
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.230
By the way that's game in any role,
in any industry anyway.

11
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.740
So I would dare say that this
is tough love that I get over.

12
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.710
But the idea is this if
you want to do this and

13
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.710
you know you want to do this Then and
we were going to talk about attending

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.840
meetups in a little bit how to find email
addresses for people how to network.

15
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.640
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit.

16
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.670
But then you will take the things
that we're talking about now and

17
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.060
you will do them even faster than

18
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.920
instead of taking this bit by
bit over the next six months.

19
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.570
So the way I tried to do this deck was
if I were you, I would do these things.

20
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.419
If I were you and I was really motivated,
I would do all these things really fast.

21
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.430
Instead of waiting around.

22
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.372
Yes, ma'am, you had a question?

23
00:01:08.372 --> 00:01:08.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: No, you're good.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH] So

24
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.260
how would I say that I was
attending this bootcamp?

25
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.570
Would that go under education?

26
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.930
Would this just go in my bio?

27
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.330
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I would
do it under your education, and

28
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.980
I might put it in the summary,
too, like this one right here.

29
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.240
It can be a little it could
sound a little bit like this.

30
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.450
Right?

31
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.770
recently completed the front end
masters two week beginner boot camp.

32
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.420
With my goal, it could be literally
just this, just swap out the one and

33
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.870
putting this The idea is this.

34
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.849
Just tell your story.

35
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.550
It doesn't need to be perfect.

36
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.740
Like we get stuck by the way.

37
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.030
I'm so like, do you ever do that
when you give somebody advice,

38
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.990
little hair in the back,
your neck stands up.

39
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.940
You get that little chill.

40
00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.210
Like hypocrite just went off in the back
of my head while I was giving you

41
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.150
this advice, like just tell your story,
get comfortable with it and

42
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.810
just it doesn't have to be
perfect the first time.

43
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.410
All I hear is in my own head that
21 years in I'm a hypocrite.

44
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.930
Why didn't I write that one blog post?

45
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.490
Why, if you go to my hire me page is it
still a draft from like four months ago?

46
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.190
I suffer from some of this too by the way,
right?

47
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.160
Be okay with where you are.

48
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.870
This says you are not
going to sit here forever.

49
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.580
You are going to learn more things.

50
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.479
You are going to become fantastic coders.

51
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.550
Many of you are going to send me an email
six months or three years from now,

52
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.450
saying, hey, do you remember that one
day in Minneapolis when he came and

53
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.320
he spoke at that thing?

54
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.590
Here's what I'm doing now and
I'm going to be like, fuck, yeah.

55
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.470
It's going to happen.

56
00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.900
It's just that right now it might seem a
little scary or a little bit overwhelming.

57
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.800
I'm not a great cheerleader by the way,
this is good as it gets.

58
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.860
But what you all have done here
in the last is a side note for

59
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.120
those of you online and
for those of you for

60
00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.500
what you've done the last two
weeks is fucking amazing.

61
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.130
And I told mark,
I wasn't gonna use the F word.

62
00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.180
Now I'm going to twice in a minute.

63
00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.450
But seriously, you've just been here for
two weeks and if you think about where you

64
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.780
were when I saw you last Tuesday or
Wednesday, where you are today.

65
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.270
Besides being a little fatigue,

66
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.140
probably besides feel like
your head's going to explode.

67
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.340
Which I would say is a good thing.

68
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.780
You are a much different person now
than 12 days ago when I first met you.

69
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.159
Just ponder that, though,
for a minute, okay?

70
00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.100
That's my, Mark.

71
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, and also like.

72
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.130
I just feel like tagging on to your thing
of like, I'm not an entry level developer.

73
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.440
I'm a junior developer,
like having that portfolio or

74
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.210
even like doing something for
a local company,

75
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:43.156
or whatever like, or
a nonprofit that you immediately, sorry.

76
00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:49.270
[COUGH] You immediately qualify yourself
as a junior developer at that moment,

77
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.130
like if you've done one
project if you've done one,

78
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.470
you've shipped one thing to the internet.

79
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.130
You know, I feel like that these
are building countries a junior.

80
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.820
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: These
are building blocks, right?

81
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.870
And you're building and
you're at the first level and

82
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.010
you're laying a foundation.

83
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.450
This is a great place to be doing it.

84
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.398
I'm hoping that you will watch all of
the rest, not all of the rest, cuz it's

85
00:04:09.398 --> 00:04:12.493
probably that's a lifetime worth of video
that Mark has at Frontend Masters now.

86
00:04:12.493 --> 00:04:17.340
You can't watch all of it,
but just keep going.

87
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.280
And by the way, Google or whatever
search engine will become your best

88
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.010
friend as you learned to ask questions,
right?

89
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.230
So I was at my startup the other day,
not my startup,

90
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.190
the one that I'm advising right now.

91
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.880
And to really talented senior developers
both googling a topic because they

92
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.180
didn't know the answer.

93
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.190
Not knowing is okay.

94
00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.280
Learning how to find it out fast
needed and you'll learn this stuff.
