00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.588
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Questions,
thoughts, comments?

2
00:00:04.588 --> 00:00:06.039
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's your opinion

3
00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.267
on the length of what
a cover letter should be?

4
00:00:08.267 --> 00:00:09.562
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: How long
should a cover letter be?

5
00:00:09.562 --> 00:00:13.816
Let's call it three to five paragraphs,
an intro, right?

6
00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:18.515
The hi and the bye, about you,
here is what you've

7
00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:23.561
researched about them, and
how you can benefit them.

8
00:00:23.561 --> 00:00:26.643
So let's call that four paragraphs.

9
00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:30.294
Nothing more than a page.

10
00:00:30.294 --> 00:00:32.370
Someone will undoubtedly ask if
I can piggyback on this one.

11
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.845
How long should my resume be?

12
00:00:34.845 --> 00:00:35.727
I still want to do this.

13
00:00:35.727 --> 00:00:37.717
Jesse and I actually spoke about
this a number of years ago.

14
00:00:37.717 --> 00:00:41.956
I wanna get seven of our recruiter and
HR friends in a room, on a round table.

15
00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:44.041
I wanna get nine or 10 bottles of wine.

16
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:47.274
I wanna get them loaded with a video
camera and hit record, and say,

17
00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:48.654
how long should a resume be?

18
00:00:48.654 --> 00:00:52.732
Cuz I guarantee you seven
people will give me 11 answers.

19
00:00:52.732 --> 00:00:54.570
There's not a rule to this.

20
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.440
My one rule is this,

21
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.633
it shouldn't be one line longer than
it takes you to talk about yourself.

22
00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.778
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: If you're under
the age of 25, I'm broadly speaking,

23
00:01:05.778 --> 00:01:10.716
and you've either been in college or
you've had a couple,

24
00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:13.208
three jobs, it can be a page.

25
00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:17.964
If, however, you're 22 years old and
you've done four internships, and

26
00:01:17.964 --> 00:01:21.002
you're in grad school,
you're already to two.

27
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.131
But really, a two-page resume is fine.

28
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:25.584
Somebody's gonna go,
you should only be one.

29
00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:27.519
Who cares?
For the love of.

30
00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:33.208
As long as it's interesting and giving
the right amount of info, that's okay.

31
00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:36.660
I did receive a 14-page
resume back in August, 14.

32
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.795
This person went back to 1968, no joke,
and you could tell they condensed it.

33
00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:47.150
There actually were, like, no one needs
to know how you coded that thing in 1974.

34
00:01:49.061 --> 00:01:53.243
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: But some of you,
though, will take and do 10 bullet points

35
00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:58.014
on that hourly job when you were 16,
and you don't need to do that.

36
00:01:58.014 --> 00:02:02.208
So that first example is funny, but
someone listening to this might go,

37
00:02:02.208 --> 00:02:06.083
[LAUGH] crap, I did that about
that one job I had, my first job.

38
00:02:06.083 --> 00:02:07.872
So don't.

39
00:02:07.872 --> 00:02:09.956
That help?

40
00:02:09.956 --> 00:02:12.987
Other questions, Mark,
is there anything else back there?

41
00:02:12.987 --> 00:02:13.642
That's it?

42
00:02:13.642 --> 00:02:14.265
Sticking out?

43
00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:16.263
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We just had
a debate about email addresses.

44
00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:19.312
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I was like,

45
00:02:19.312 --> 00:02:22.676
don't use @yahoo, don't use-
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So

46
00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:25.764
how many people were for you, and how many
people were like me and they don't care?

47
00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:28.789
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Like a poll.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What do you mean?

48
00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:30.618
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: How many people were
on your side, and how many were on mine?

49
00:02:30.618 --> 00:02:32.618
You're a judger, and I'm not.

50
00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:33.921
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,

51
00:02:33.921 --> 00:02:36.419
I think specifically
around web developers,

52
00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.694
and specifically around CTOs,
we look at that kinda thing.

53
00:02:39.694 --> 00:02:43.167
If you're like, firstname@yourdomain.com-
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: And

54
00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:44.595
that's why I said that
in the very beginning.

55
00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:46.677
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like, for
instance, brian@brianholt.com,

56
00:02:46.677 --> 00:02:47.970
that's a respectable thing.

57
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.870
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like,

58
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.725
moreso than even a Gmail.

59
00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:58.298
But if I see anything like AOL, or Yahoo,
or whatever, it's just, like, come on.

60
00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.257
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So this is why,
though, I said at the beginning,

61
00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:01.237
go get your domain name,

62
00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:03.870
where you'll never have to have
this conversation or the debate.
