00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.780
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: I didn't
start this presentation.

2
00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.200
It dawns on me,
I probably should have with this.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.440
I am actually an introvert by nature.

4
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.150
Just so y'all know.

5
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.100
You're like, no.

6
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.290
Really, I am.

7
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.020
So I can do these presentations.

8
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.680
This is fantastic and a lot of fun for me.

9
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.130
And I will go home, and the girlfriend and

10
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.040
the kids already know I won't talk to
them tonight cuz it's just how I'm wired.

11
00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.200
So I'm an introvert by nature,
I have to use these tools.

12
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.557
But the cool thing about doing
it online is it's a little bit

13
00:00:25.557 --> 00:00:28.246
like,
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: It's a little

14
00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:29.710
passive-aggressive.

15
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.280
I can post that status update and run.

16
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.380
I didn't actually have to talk to anybody,
at least not for the short run.

17
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.650
That's fantastic for me, okay.

18
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.697
I love people, I love you all, but you
all drain me cuz I'm an introvert, okay.

19
00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:47.161
And so this gives people an opportunity
to be able to reach out but

20
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:51.690
maybe not in so a personal way that
you start feeling uncomfortable.

21
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.730
So for the introverts in the room,
I got your back.

22
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So what is I guess the
general purpose of connecting on LinkedIn?

23
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.810
I get that there's like networking, but
I often get people, some rando in New York

24
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.200
wants to connect with me, and maybe
they have a job kind of similar to me.

25
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.691
Usually it's some rando and it's unclear.

26
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:14.850
In my other networking profiles,
like on Facebook,

27
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.300
I'm not gonna friend you unless
I know you and am a friend.

28
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.392
Is there any value in
accepting connections

29
00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:24.110
from people that-
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: The idea that if you

30
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.789
are in the United States, I pretty
much accept anyone's invitation, okay.

31
00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.774
I also get really good at,
because of the role that I'm in,

32
00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:34.650
figuring out who the fake profiles.

33
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.620
That photo just doesn't look like one
that someone would have on LinkedIn.

34
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.994
And I'll actually at times do a reverse
image in Google to figure out if

35
00:01:42.994 --> 00:01:47.237
it's someone's stolen photo and
they mash some things together.

36
00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:49.608
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you as a recruiter,
that makes a lot of sense.

37
00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:52.117
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: For you as
individually, if it's someone who's in

38
00:01:52.117 --> 00:01:56.370
the tech space, if it's someone,
you're in the fashion space, right?

39
00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.683
If it's someone, so you may be getting a
bunch of invites from people who are from

40
00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:02.975
LA or New York or
Chicago or whatever it is.

41
00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:07.970
You kind of have to set your own,
I don't want to use the word boundary,

42
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.140
but frame how it is that
you want to do that.

43
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.914
If a recruiter or an HR person is
gonna connect with you on LinkedIn,

44
00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:18.623
If they're in your home country or
if they're in the Mid-West and

45
00:02:18.623 --> 00:02:22.950
you're in the Mid-West,
I would accept those all the time.

46
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.739
And it's just like on Facebook too, right,
you can disconnect with someone and

47
00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:27.640
they don't know.

48
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.830
So that's okay too.

49
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.710
But find out what your, find out what
your reason for being on here is.

50
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.220
Some of you will just connect with
everyone and send invites to everyone,

51
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.150
that's okay.

52
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.130
So my network,

53
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.900
I sent out an email this morning that
my network is very wide and shallow.

54
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.210
I know a lot of people this well,

55
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.020
it's just the nature of
the business that I'm in.

56
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.928
There are CTOs in town who
only have 150 connections, and

57
00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:56.770
150 of them are with other CTOs in town.

58
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.180
And that's how they use LinkedIn as a real
private sort of network sort of thing.

59
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.180
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Other
questions before I keep going?

60
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was gonna say,

61
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.070
you can actually follow people
without connecting with them as well.

62
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.480
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And then as much as you

63
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.300
creep on everyone's profiles and
everything, but

64
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.280
with a basic account you actually
can run out of page views.

65
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.660
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: You can run out
of page views on a free account now?

66
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.570
I was unaware of that.

67
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.330
So what happens is if you also start
to send a lot of connections in a short

68
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.590
amount of time,
LinkedIn will put you in LinkedIn jail,

69
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.510
as we affectionately call it, and they'll
suspend your account for two to four days.

70
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.370
And then you have to send a message
to LinkedIn support, say I'm sorry,

71
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.110
I didn't mean to do that,

72
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.140
I wasn't spamming a bunch of people,
and grabble, grabble, grabble, right.

73
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.975
Hope nobody from LinkedIn
ever sees me say that.

74
00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:44.030
But there are there are some
constraints to the tool.
