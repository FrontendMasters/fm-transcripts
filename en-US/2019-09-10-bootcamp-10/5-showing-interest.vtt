&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: Personalize invites,
creep on profiles, follow companies.

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.650
If there are companies that you think you
want to work at one day, have interest in,

3
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.260
start following them on LinkedIn.

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.886
If the recruiter and HR and hiring
managers of those companies are good at

5
00:00:14.886 --> 00:00:16.796
what they do, then they will see you.

6
00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:18.017
They will look at your profile,

7
00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:21.340
they will come back to you as they
are trying to increase their staff.

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.355
It's kind of a very subtle way of being
able to show that you have interest in

9
00:00:25.355 --> 00:00:25.880
a group.

10
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.478
Two is that now their company news will
start appearing in your updates, and so

11
00:00:29.478 --> 00:00:31.124
you can start liking those things.

12
00:00:31.124 --> 00:00:34.550
Like if you're interested
a particular startup in the Bay Area,

13
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.241
start following that company.

14
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:39.180
Start liking every one
of the company updates.

15
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.449
They will be paying attention,
they should be paying attention, okay.

16
00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.220
I would post status updates once or
twice a week on LinkedIn.

17
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.910
One of your updates,
if you haven't yet done it this week.

18
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.870
And since it's late Friday afternoon
when we're recording this,

19
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.840
maybe you're gonna do it on Monday.

20
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.990
It's gonna be your photo of you that
you've been here this week, saying,

21
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.510
hey, I attended the Frontend Masters

22
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.800
two week beginner boot camp
in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

23
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.455
Had a fantastic time
thanks to the instructors.

24
00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:10.940
Tag them on, tag them on the post, okay.

25
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.120
But do that once or twice a week.

26
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.229
So it can be like you're attending
a meetup or a user group.

27
00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.449
We'll talk about that in a little while.

28
00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.988
But the idea being though is that you
want to remind people that you're here,

29
00:01:18.988 --> 00:01:20.486
that you're alive, that you're working.

30
00:01:20.486 --> 00:01:22.142
This is what you're doing,
this is what you're interested in.

31
00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:23.588
And it can be like articles.

32
00:01:23.588 --> 00:01:26.960
And I've got a list of like what status
updates can look like, all right?
