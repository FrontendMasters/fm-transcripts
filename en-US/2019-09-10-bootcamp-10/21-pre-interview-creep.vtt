00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.810
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: A pre
interview creep.

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.520
Okay.
So again, whatever pace you're going to be

3
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.790
on this path that I've been talking about
today, okay, when you get to the part

4
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.500
that you're going to be going in for
an interview, creep on these people.

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.980
I want you to do to them
what I know they did to you.

6
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.990
Google them, look for them on LinkedIn and
Twitter, figure out what they're into.

7
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.150
Where did they go to school?

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.950
What are they about?

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.900
What are their hobbies?

10
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.430
Because you will find points
of commonality with them.

11
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.680
It makes your conversation with them
a lot smoother, and a whole lot easier.

12
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.370
If the company has a press release page,
a communication page, whatever it is,

13
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.100
you know as much about them as you can.

14
00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.380
So that you can say, so in town here,
there's a company called SPS Commerce, and

15
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.270
they're infamous now cause they're
at 72 quarters of earnings growth.

16
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.600
Shoot that off while you're having a tech
interview with the VP of engineering.

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.960
He'll be like, you're paying attention.

18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.230
Yes.

19
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.430
I also know that you do work
with these three nonprofits.

20
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.372
On Instagram I saw that you guys celebrate
you celebrate St. Patrick's Day by decking

21
00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:08.564
out the entire atrium of the office
tower now named after you in green.

22
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:12.260
&gt;&gt; Paul DeBettignies: So
you did some research on us.

23
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.760
Yes.

24
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.140
By the way I do this with all of
the people who I'm reaching out to

25
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.269
in my now not being you but
being me stage.

26
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.360
So there are six startups
here in town that I've had

27
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.450
conversations with between now and
the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, and

28
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.720
I'm telling you I know as much
about them as they know about them.

29
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.650
What's working, what's not working,
what do they need help with.

30
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.830
I know it like the back of my hand,

31
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.730
because I know every one of those
groups is not just talking to me.

32
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.920
For the record,
they would be foolish to not work with me.

33
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.080
Just like these groups would be
foolish not to work with you.

34
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.960
You guys have experience, you bring stuff

35
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.320
to the table that someone who hasn't been
just brought up as a coder doesn't have.

36
00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.850
So let's not forget that.
