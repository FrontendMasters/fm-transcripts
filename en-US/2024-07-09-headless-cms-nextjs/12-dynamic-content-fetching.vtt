00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.920
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Now we need to make, the
call to get the data so const data = wait.

2
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.677
I'm gonna restart my builds, when you
move files around sometimes it doesn't

3
00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:15.230
pick up some of the changes
that you did so, let's do that.

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.199
So I'm gonna say wait, get,
what did I call this one?

5
00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:24.178
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: GetContentForCustomerPosts.

6
00:00:24.178 --> 00:00:28.548
So getContentForCustomerPosts.

7
00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:33.233
Because this is a page on a dynamic route,

8
00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:39.096
it's always gonna get a params object
here as a property or as a prop.

9
00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:43.502
And then, let me make this async.

10
00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:48.804
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We know we need to pass
in a slug here, and we have slug,

11
00:00:48.804 --> 00:00:50.742
it's gonna be on the params.

12
00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:53.629
Because what we put here as slug,
whatever you put here,

13
00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.687
that's what's gonna be
on the params object.

14
00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:00.339
So that's gonna be params.slug.

15
00:01:03.078 --> 00:01:05.694
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If this was ID,
it'd be params.ID.

16
00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:11.529
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Why is
this thing freaking out?

17
00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:16.950
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay [LAUGH]
that's what was there.

18
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.620
Okay, so we got the data.

19
00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:27.472
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Wait,
did I not add the types of the data?

20
00:01:27.472 --> 00:01:29.332
Yeah, add the types, let me add the types.

21
00:01:29.332 --> 00:01:39.108
There we go, this will be,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Customer post query, okay.

22
00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.025
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

23
00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:45.448
Let's say, got to have my types.

24
00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:53.539
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, okay, so
this will be, so we'll say content

25
00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.731
= data.net.items.0, so that's our content.

26
00:01:58.731 --> 00:02:03.700
So we'll just log this just
to make sure this works, and

27
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.668
we just need to navigate to
a slug that exists on a piece of

28
00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:12.601
content in our CMS,
which we only have one.

29
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:16.583
So that should work just fine, and
then we'll replace some of this stuff, so

30
00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:17.669
let's go try that.

31
00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.825
I'm just gonna grab this right here.

32
00:02:24.954 --> 00:02:29.400
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, okay, so
it'll be customers/ and then that slug, so

33
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.122
let's see what happens.

34
00:02:32.764 --> 00:02:34.722
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Looks like it
still loathes, that's good, and

35
00:02:34.722 --> 00:02:36.691
then the content is here,
so it works just fine.

36
00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:46.061
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Next thing we need to do
is we need to render this rich text JSON.

37
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:49.285
So, in order to do that,

38
00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:54.901
we can use a component from Contentful.

39
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.350
So Contentful has a component for this, so

40
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.575
it'll be Contentful
rich-text-react-renderer, that's the one.

41
00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:07.675
Well, it should already be installed,
but that's what it is right there.

42
00:03:07.675 --> 00:03:09.965
Contentful rich-text-renderer.

43
00:03:09.965 --> 00:03:14.312
And then really all you have to
do is you call it with the JSON,

44
00:03:14.312 --> 00:03:18.691
you just pass it to JSON and
you're pretty much good to go.

45
00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:20.701
So let's go ahead and do that.

46
00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:26.810
And we have the JSON, it's on the JSON
field, if we look, it's body.JSON,

47
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.001
it's that, we're gonna pass that in,
so let's do that.

48
00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:35.551
So we got content, I'm gonna go down
here to where the rich text is.

49
00:03:37.512 --> 00:03:40.707
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's all of this,
I'm just gonna collapse it all.

50
00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:44.617
And if we do it right, it should look
exactly the same, nothing should change.

51
00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.567
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
let's see if I can get all of this.

52
00:03:55.925 --> 00:03:59.457
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, and
what is the name of that component?

53
00:04:03.498 --> 00:04:06.632
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go this one,
so I'll copy that import.

54
00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:16.781
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Just make a placeholder so
I can come back to this here.

55
00:04:21.013 --> 00:04:21.728
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

56
00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:28.177
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Maybe
this is not installed.

57
00:04:28.177 --> 00:04:30.009
Just this MP installed just to be sure.

58
00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:44.243
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
contentful/rich-text-react-renderer.

59
00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:46.633
Okay, so we got that.

60
00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:49.053
Go down to where I left my placeholder,
here we are.

61
00:04:50.313 --> 00:04:58.971
And I will say,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: DocumentsToReactComponents,

62
00:04:58.971 --> 00:05:02.512
that would be content.body.json.

63
00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:09.050
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So if I go back and
check the site, it should look the same,

64
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.148
and it does.

65
00:05:11.208 --> 00:05:15.306
But now, this isn't hard-coded content.

66
00:05:15.306 --> 00:05:20.023
This is the rich text coming from the CMS,
so let's go edit some of it and we'll see.

67
00:05:20.023 --> 00:05:23.286
So if I go here and
I say let's put something here so

68
00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:25.721
we can see it immediately, I guess.

69
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:29.332
Hello there and then publish this, and

70
00:05:29.332 --> 00:05:34.593
then go back to our site,
do a hard refresh, there we go.

71
00:05:34.593 --> 00:05:36.523
So I think this is pretty powerful.

72
00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:39.595
You can create a really good
blogging solution like this,

73
00:05:39.595 --> 00:05:43.543
now the editing experience is as good
as it's gonna get without having like

74
00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:46.254
the app whose job is to
make an editing experience.

75
00:05:46.254 --> 00:05:50.298
It's a little widget, that's gonna be be
there, but it's pretty good, it works.

76
00:05:50.298 --> 00:05:55.336
There's a bunch of camps of what should
the output of a rich text editor be.

77
00:05:55.336 --> 00:05:59.389
I think the end of the day
JSON is probably the best, but

78
00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.710
when you do that you have to
also support a renderer in every

79
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.461
single environment in which
your customers might use it.

80
00:06:08.461 --> 00:06:12.882
Because if you've created this JSON output
or you just leave it up to them to create

81
00:06:12.882 --> 00:06:16.021
some recursive renderer that
loops through this thing and

82
00:06:16.021 --> 00:06:21.095
maps it to whatever output they need, you
also have to do the work of doing that.

83
00:06:21.095 --> 00:06:25.855
So, but I do think that's the way,
that way it's composable.

84
00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:28.106
You can take your content wherever
you want, bring it wherever you want,

85
00:06:28.106 --> 00:06:29.135
it just works, it's just JSON.

86
00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:34.016
Okay, so we got that, let's move some of
this other stuff into dynamic land, so

87
00:06:34.016 --> 00:06:35.665
right here, this is the title.

88
00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:43.874
So we can say, content.title let's do
we have here, think that was that.

89
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.573
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
that might have been at some other stuff.

90
00:06:49.573 --> 00:06:52.194
I guess we're here Airbnb Inc,

91
00:06:52.194 --> 00:06:57.543
we could this is the thing on
the right I think that's disrepair.

92
00:06:59.063 --> 00:07:07.063
Let's change this, so we can say,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Content.customer.name,

93
00:07:07.063 --> 00:07:11.353
and then we don't have their address or

94
00:07:11.353 --> 00:07:16.171
anything like that, but it's just a logo.

95
00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:17.222
I think this is the logo.

96
00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.590
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Or is that something else?

97
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.480
No, that's a logo, okay.

98
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.130
We gotta bring in an image component,
I don't feel like doing all that.

99
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.570
But you put an image component there,
have that work.

100
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.412
So let's save that, and if we go back,
there it is, there's Canon,

101
00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:36.240
there's our stuff.

102
00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.742
There is the new title.

103
00:07:37.742 --> 00:07:39.597
So that's good to go.
