1
00:00:00.262 --> 00:00:03.694
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, all right,
welcome back, hope everyone had a small,

2
00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:04.421
nice break.

3
00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.986
So let's hop into creating some content.

4
00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:14.180
Yeah, so how about we go back
to our Contentful instance,

5
00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.576
and I'm gonna click on content here.

6
00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:22.250
I don't have any content, so
like there say, now for the fun part,

7
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.015
[LAUGH] I'm going to click here,
I'm going to make a new hero, okay?

8
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:30.825
As you can see, all my required
fields are lit up, it's a form.

9
00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:34.478
So this is what people on your
content team, your marketing team,

10
00:00:34.478 --> 00:00:38.543
whoever is responsible for
editing content, this is what they'll see.

11
00:00:38.543 --> 00:00:41.758
So everything we just selected
on that content model page,

12
00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:43.636
that's what gets rendered here.

13
00:00:43.636 --> 00:00:46.581
So for the title, for this pre-title,

14
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:51.962
I'm just gonna say something like,
Beta is live, something like that.

15
00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:55.289
For the title, I'm gonna say,

16
00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.353
Work in progress,
we're still thinking of it.

17
00:01:00.353 --> 00:01:04.637
[LAUGH] And then for the subtitle,

18
00:01:04.637 --> 00:01:09.992
I'm just gonna put a bunch of random words

19
00:01:09.992 --> 00:01:15.507
here because I don't know what to say yet.

20
00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:18.701
So we're gonna put that there.

21
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:22.393
And then for our Call To Actions,
we get this nice little GUI.

22
00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:26.793
So I'm gonna click here,
select the Button, I wanna add a button.

23
00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:31.471
This button has a label, the first
one will say Getting Started, and

24
00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.416
it's gonna just stay here.

25
00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:34.374
It's gonna stay at home.

26
00:01:36.038 --> 00:01:37.959
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm then
gonna click Publish on this,

27
00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.530
we'll talk about the different
states in a minute.

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.865
They're mostly all
the same across most CMSs.

29
00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.408
So I'm gonna click Publish.

30
00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:49.039
I'm then going to make another
button because it says you need two.

31
00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.606
So I'm gonna do that.

32
00:01:50.606 --> 00:01:51.690
Make another button.

33
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.901
And this one's gonna say,
Read the docs, something like that.

34
00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:05.764
And it's gonna go to /docs, and
I will publish that one, and go back.

35
00:02:05.764 --> 00:02:09.445
So we'll notice in most headless CMS UIs,
you're just gonna be in like modal hell.

36
00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:12.309
There'll just be modals on top of modals,
on top of modals.

37
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:14.766
Every relationship, there's another modal.

38
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:18.088
So you have to be able to go back,
and I think that's where,

39
00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:22.406
I remember when we were working on our CMS
and we used one of those apps where you

40
00:02:22.406 --> 00:02:26.538
can watch a user's session to see what
they do, they all got stuck there.

41
00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:30.358
It was just, unless you are just
the person making the schema and

42
00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:33.919
you understand relationships,
you will get lost on that.

43
00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:38.664
So there's a balance between putting
a bunch of stuff on one schema and

44
00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:42.858
not putting too much on one schema,
and it's never perfect.

45
00:02:42.858 --> 00:02:46.527
So I think it's one of those things that
have to be solved between the developer

46
00:02:46.527 --> 00:02:50.434
who's designing the schema and the content
person who's gonna be filling it out.

47
00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:54.885
Like, there has to be like some education
there, some meeting, some agreement.

48
00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:58.726
So, it's just that typically those two
people aren't the best at talking with

49
00:02:58.726 --> 00:02:59.366
each other.

50
00:02:59.366 --> 00:03:04.100
[LAUGH] A lot of CMSs fall through those
cracks simply because the developer

51
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.933
can't talk to the content person
very well and vice versa.

52
00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:11.626
Okay, so that's there, and
then I'm going to publish this whole hero.

53
00:03:11.626 --> 00:03:13.405
So I'm gonna do that.

54
00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:17.455
So there we go, if I go back to my
content list, I now have three things,

55
00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:20.978
I have one hero that I made, and
I have two buttons that I made.

56
00:03:24.682 --> 00:03:27.521
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You should have something
similar, and they should all be published.

57
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:31.622
Now what I wanna do is, before I go
into the app and write the code,

58
00:03:31.622 --> 00:03:36.398
because we're using GraphQL, I want to
try out the actual query that we're

59
00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:39.700
gonna be running, so
I can just go Copy and Paste it.

60
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.623
So luckily, because we are using GraphQL,
we can use some really cool tools.

61
00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:48.895
So one of the tools is gonna be called,

62
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:55.047
if you just Google,
Apollo Studio, you Google that.

63
00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:59.304
They have this Explorer Sandbox, go there.

64
00:03:59.304 --> 00:04:01.400
Click on that.

65
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.840
Click on the Explorer Sandbox, and
then what you can do up here in the URL,

66
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.280
you can add the GraphQL URL for
Contentful.

67
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.156
So we'll just do that.

68
00:04:14.156 --> 00:04:16.748
So I'm just gonna grab the one
that we have in fetch, right?

69
00:04:16.748 --> 00:04:20.574
We'll grab this URL here, not that.

70
00:04:20.574 --> 00:04:21.794
Come here.

71
00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:29.205
Grab this URL and go,
why is my dictionary open?

72
00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:29.880
Go here.

73
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.660
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
put this up here at the top.

74
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.327
You need to obviously get
rid of this placeholder for

75
00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:40.245
this environment variable and
add in your real space ID.

76
00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:41.350
So let me go get mine.

77
00:04:46.506 --> 00:04:54.168
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Like that, and
then you need to add in some headers.

78
00:04:54.168 --> 00:05:00.832
So you click on Headers here at
the bottom, you can click on a New Header.

79
00:05:00.832 --> 00:05:03.302
Click here it says Header key,
go to Authorization.

80
00:05:06.002 --> 00:05:10.164
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then you want to paste
in your access token with the word Bearer

81
00:05:10.164 --> 00:05:11.155
in front of it.

82
00:05:11.155 --> 00:05:16.523
So Bearer space, make sure there's
a space after the word Bearer,

83
00:05:16.523 --> 00:05:20.399
and grab your access token and
place it in there.

84
00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:23.203
And then once you do that,
boom, it'll load up like magic.

85
00:05:26.236 --> 00:05:28.608
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You know you did it right
when you see a bunch of stuff here

86
00:05:28.608 --> 00:05:29.173
on the left.

87
00:05:35.781 --> 00:05:39.706
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So the steps to
follow again, add the GraphQL URL

88
00:05:39.706 --> 00:05:44.414
at the top here, make sure you
put your space ID on the end.

89
00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:47.573
Click on Headers,
add an Authorization Header.

90
00:05:47.573 --> 00:05:52.895
The value should be Bearer space,
your access token that's in your env file.

91
00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:55.510
Once you do that, you don't have to hit
refresh, you don't have to do anything.

92
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.441
It should populate with some, if you
know what GraphQL is, these are just,

93
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.138
you can think of these as like
routes that you can hit, but

94
00:06:04.138 --> 00:06:07.009
they're based on your Contentful schema.

95
00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:08.061
So it's going to evolve.

96
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:10.887
As you make more content models,
this will change.

97
00:06:10.887 --> 00:06:12.033
This is the cheat code.

98
00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:14.991
This is how you build really quickly.

99
00:06:14.991 --> 00:06:18.751
I think GraphQL is probably the most
useful on the frontend when it comes

100
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:19.259
to CMSs.

101
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.309
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, I'll keep going then.

102
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.761
So, to use this tool,
let me make this bigger.

103
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:35.343
To use this tool, it's very simple,
we don't even really have to do anything.

104
00:06:35.343 --> 00:06:39.783
I want to be able to get
the one hero that I have and

105
00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:43.558
get the data for it and
put it on the page.

106
00:06:43.558 --> 00:06:45.707
So there are a bunch
of ways I can do that.

107
00:06:45.707 --> 00:06:49.473
If I use the one here that's called hero,
it requires an ID.

108
00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:56.028
So I could, being the smart developer I
am, go get the ID that was created for

109
00:06:56.028 --> 00:07:00.653
that one hero, but
that's assuming I made the hero.

110
00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:03.026
What if the content creator made the hero?

111
00:07:03.026 --> 00:07:05.417
I just made the model and
then they went and made the hero.

112
00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.730
So, I guess I could still go get it.

113
00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.588
So there's this like condition of like,
I don't know what the idea is,

114
00:07:11.588 --> 00:07:14.244
cuz in most cases you don't
know what the idea is of

115
00:07:14.244 --> 00:07:17.747
something unless you got it from
a list in the original instance.

116
00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:21.912
And I don't need a list of heros, so I'm
not gonna hard code it here because again,

117
00:07:21.912 --> 00:07:24.530
they could delete that hero,
make another one, and

118
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.270
then that ID is gonna break my app.

119
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.797
So instead, what I can do with Contentful
is I'm just gonna click on the hero

120
00:07:30.797 --> 00:07:33.485
collection, which is
how you can query for,

121
00:07:33.485 --> 00:07:36.983
you can basically do filtering
on the heroes collection.

122
00:07:36.983 --> 00:07:40.571
Like, find me a hero that has this field
value that contains this and limit to one,

123
00:07:40.571 --> 00:07:42.391
so I'll do something like that, right?

124
00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:46.390
So I'm gonna click on,
I can hit this plus button right here, and

125
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.300
it's just gonna add it for me.

126
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.322
I don't even have to write anything,
it's gonna make a GraphQL query.

127
00:07:51.322 --> 00:07:54.940
If you're looking at this, don't worry
about it, just look at this over here,

128
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:56.538
these are the fields that you want,

129
00:07:56.538 --> 00:07:59.860
you just click plus on the fields that
you want and it'll add them for you.

130
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.155
So for us, we want to get all the items,
so I'm gonna say,

131
00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:08.189
give me the items like that,
and then I want the title,

132
00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:11.563
I want the subtitle, I want the pre-title.

133
00:08:11.563 --> 00:08:15.683
And then I want to get all the buttons,
which we called Call To Actions.

134
00:08:15.683 --> 00:08:18.347
So I'm gonna say, Give me those.

135
00:08:18.347 --> 00:08:21.141
And out of those, I want the items.

136
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:25.441
And from that,
I want the link and the label.

137
00:08:25.441 --> 00:08:26.724
So I want all of that.

138
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.104
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You're right that
if you are fancy with GraphQL,

139
00:08:32.104 --> 00:08:33.820
it'll all complete for you.

140
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.733
If you type, it'll say that.

141
00:08:40.181 --> 00:08:43.804
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So that's my collection,
so if I run this, and

142
00:08:43.804 --> 00:08:47.427
actually let me go back,
I could limit to one but

143
00:08:47.427 --> 00:08:51.791
we only made one,
I don't have a content team right now.

144
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:55.128
So I'm just gonna trust that I'm
only gonna make one for now.

145
00:08:55.128 --> 00:08:58.690
Again, a lot of CMSs have
a restriction you can add, like this.

146
00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.456
You can only make one instance of
this model and nothing else, and

147
00:09:01.456 --> 00:09:03.681
that would be useful here,
but they don't have it.

148
00:09:03.681 --> 00:09:07.464
So I'm gonna run it and
there we go, I give back.

149
00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:11.039
If you never use GraphQL, you're gonna
give back data in the exact same shape

150
00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:13.142
that this describes, the exact same shape.

151
00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:16.615
So that's what we got back,
we got data.heroCollection,

152
00:09:16.615 --> 00:09:21.328
that has an items property on it, that's
an array of objects that look like this.

153
00:09:21.328 --> 00:09:23.280
Each one of those has an array of buttons.

154
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:27.349
That's the flow, as I make content,
I make my model, I make my content,

155
00:09:27.349 --> 00:09:30.316
I come in here and I test it,
and then I just copy this.

156
00:09:30.316 --> 00:09:36.028
I just copy this whole thing for
Bao, just give me that query.
