1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.242
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's get started then.

2
00:00:01.242 --> 00:00:05.054
So a couple things we
need to do in the repo.

3
00:00:05.054 --> 00:00:09.282
We need to, after you make an account,
we gotta add some environment variables to

4
00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:13.224
our repo so we can actually make a call
to Contentful and do things like that.

5
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.480
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you
create a.env on the root,

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.630
you need to just add these four
environment variables here.

7
00:00:25.956 --> 00:00:32.283
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So you need Contentful
space ID, Contentful Access Token,

8
00:00:32.283 --> 00:00:39.493
Contentful Preview Access Token,
and Contentful Preview Secret.

9
00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:45.552
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: These are also in
the GitHub repo on the main branch.

10
00:00:45.552 --> 00:00:49.345
I think there's an env example file on
there if you just want to copy those,

11
00:00:49.345 --> 00:00:52.735
that way you don't have to like look and
follow along right now.

12
00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.096
But yeah, they're on the env example,

13
00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:58.439
I guess I just didn't push it
up on this step zero branch.

14
00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:01.095
And don't be still in my stuff,
I'm gonna regenerate these.

15
00:01:01.095 --> 00:01:03.003
So how do we get these values?

16
00:01:03.003 --> 00:01:07.285
We need to go to Contentful, so if you
start writing those just to show you

17
00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:11.518
where they are in GitHub, so
if you're like, I still need those.

18
00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:18.032
Here, go to step on main branch,
there's e in

19
00:01:18.032 --> 00:01:23.245
the example file, oops,
here we go, come here.

20
00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:25.259
There we go,
you can just copy that, all right.

21
00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.541
So, to get these values, it's like
really tucked in there on Contentful,

22
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:34.440
like, they really don't
want you to have it.

23
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.518
But once you're here on your space,
you can click on settings,

24
00:01:39.518 --> 00:01:44.030
you can click on API keys and
you have to make a new API key,

25
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.816
I already have one,
I called it headless next.

26
00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.339
And once you make a new API key,

27
00:01:49.339 --> 00:01:51.809
it will give you all
the values that you need here.

28
00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:55.617
So your space ID, your access token,

29
00:01:55.617 --> 00:02:00.505
and your preview access
token are gonna be here.

30
00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:05.482
That fourth one, that preview secret,
I think that's what it's called,

31
00:02:05.482 --> 00:02:09.098
right, preview secret,
yeah, the preview secret.

32
00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:12.266
That's a value that you can come up with,
so you can put whatever you want there.

33
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.604
So the next thing you want to
do is just kinda just dive in,

34
00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:20.423
and this is something that, it's just
like a thought exercise on data modeling.

35
00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:24.082
I think data modeling is probably
the biggest roadblocker for

36
00:02:24.082 --> 00:02:25.896
adopting a Helix CMS.

37
00:02:25.896 --> 00:02:29.294
It's just figuring out
the shape of your data.

38
00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.862
This is why it's almost impossible to
do unless you already have a website or

39
00:02:32.862 --> 00:02:34.356
a design for a website.

40
00:02:34.356 --> 00:02:39.565
Okay, so,
imagine having to model a schema for

41
00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:45.046
a database for
an app that you've never heard of.

42
00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:47.678
And you don't know any of
the features of the app,

43
00:02:47.678 --> 00:02:49.766
it would be really hard to do that.

44
00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.711
That's what it's like trying to
model content for Helix CMS,

45
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:58.030
when you have no idea what the website is,
you're just like, okay,

46
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.913
yeah, maybe I know every app has users,
so I had a user table.

47
00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:04.913
Okay, every website has links,
so I add some links, but

48
00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:06.850
then you get to a point you're like,

49
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.996
I don't really know what supposed to do
here until I have a designer a website.

50
00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:15.002
So I really do think that's the biggest
blocker because there has to be so

51
00:03:15.002 --> 00:03:19.142
much work done before you can make
a sophisticated enough content model and

52
00:03:19.142 --> 00:03:21.396
then even then even all the work is done.

53
00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:24.531
You have a website,
you have a design, sitting there and

54
00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:27.090
thinking about what
that's gonna look like.

55
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.360
There's some repercussions to those
decisions that you make because the data

56
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.170
model that you decide to create,

57
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.609
that's how your content folks
are gonna have to edit content.

58
00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.433
So if it's very abstract and
heavily nested and relational, and

59
00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:45.563
you're, yeah,
I made the best schema in the world.

60
00:03:45.563 --> 00:03:49.684
It's so good your content team is
struggling to make a blog post because

61
00:03:49.684 --> 00:03:52.027
there's like 30 relations in there.

62
00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:55.745
It's like you [LAUGH] so
you really have to think about that, and

63
00:03:55.745 --> 00:03:59.153
it's gonna be specific to
the CMS that you make.

64
00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:02.941
So you almost have to be an expert of
the CMS that you choose before you

65
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:05.207
can actually learn how to use the tools.

66
00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:07.754
And they all have different things,

67
00:04:07.754 --> 00:04:11.945
they all have their own different
types of content fields and

68
00:04:11.945 --> 00:04:16.729
feature some of them even let you
visually edit it gets pretty crazy.

69
00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.141
So there I think that right there is
the biggest blocker I think a lot of real

70
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:23.885
estate investors know that which is why
they focus on developer experience, but

71
00:04:23.885 --> 00:04:26.274
it's almost impossible To like,
get it perfect.

72
00:04:26.274 --> 00:04:30.965
You really just gotta just like motivate
the developers to like get through it.

73
00:04:30.965 --> 00:04:34.640
But I would imagine something like
AI is probably gonna help with that,

74
00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.227
where you can just use AI
to model the data for you.

75
00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:41.807
You could just send it a screenshot of
your design or here's my Figma design,

76
00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:44.483
design a content model for
this and ideally,

77
00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:48.399
that would be good because it is for
sure the biggest roadblock.

78
00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:50.850
I would say that's probably
where most of the drop-off is.
