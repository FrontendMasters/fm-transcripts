00:00:00.154 --> 00:00:05.154
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's work on adding
some content to the page in which we can

2
00:00:05.154 --> 00:00:06.861
control the order.

3
00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:11.356
So there's many different places in which
we can do that, one really cool place

4
00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:15.516
is down here on the spots Issues faster
feature section where you can see,

5
00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:17.613
you can do this carousel type thing.

6
00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:20.263
That's pretty cool, we could do it there.

7
00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:22.538
Another way is really just
like the links up top.

8
00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:25.874
I think it's just probably useful to
be able to control these links and

9
00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:28.146
create these NAV bars
that you can pass around.

10
00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:31.914
So let's try that, so
let's try to create these links up top.

11
00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:36.646
We'll create a NAV bar, try to move
those around, and we'll go from there.

12
00:00:36.646 --> 00:00:41.599
So, what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna look at the code to see

13
00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:44.295
what is the structure of that.

14
00:00:44.295 --> 00:00:49.449
So I believe that's in
the component called header.

15
00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.785
So in the header we have, right here we
have a UL with some hard coded links.

16
00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:58.387
So it looks like there is an href,
there's an about.

17
00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:03.266
It sounds very similar to what we
already have with the button type.

18
00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:07.326
So we can just reuse the button type,
we just need to make a collection in which

19
00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:10.025
we can put all these on one field so
we can sort them.

20
00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:14.446
So we'll make a collection and
we'll make a type called navigation, so

21
00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:19.677
that way you can make different navigation
which is actually quite common for LCMSs.

22
00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:20.473
So for instance,

23
00:01:20.473 --> 00:01:23.506
you might have many different places
in which you have navigation.

24
00:01:23.506 --> 00:01:24.876
So you might have one here, right?

25
00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:30.821
You might have one down here, so
this is like a footer navigation,

26
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:33.908
this is like a header navigation.

27
00:01:33.908 --> 00:01:37.222
This might also have something on mobile,
I'm guessing.

28
00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:41.620
Let me see, yep, so
you have like a mobile navigation, right?

29
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.530
So these are all different
navigations you can control and

30
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.890
let someone else have the responsibility
of maintaining so you don't have to.

31
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.935
So let's do that, go back to our
Contentful, our content model.

32
00:01:55.935 --> 00:02:00.925
Let's make a new model,
we'll call this navigation.

33
00:02:06.866 --> 00:02:10.776
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We'll add a field and
it really just needs a name,

34
00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:13.672
what is the name of this navigation?

35
00:02:13.672 --> 00:02:20.344
That's pretty much gonna act as the ID,
so we'll say short text.

36
00:02:20.344 --> 00:02:25.638
It will be the entry title,
it will be required and it will be unique.

37
00:02:25.638 --> 00:02:27.690
So I'm treating these names like the ID,
so

38
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.356
that way you can have two
navigations with the same name.

39
00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:34.359
So, treating that as like an ID, and

40
00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.138
it's just a simple field, that's easy and

41
00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:46.515
then the next field is really just
gonna be the buttons that go in it.

42
00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:51.328
So we'll just say, I'll call these links,
and it's gonna be many

43
00:02:51.328 --> 00:02:57.320
references,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And I'm gonna say,

44
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.222
except only specific entry type,
so that'll be button.

45
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.158
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And there we go, we'll
allow bulk editing and all this stuff.

46
00:03:12.594 --> 00:03:16.177
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so
we got our links, we got our buttons.

47
00:03:16.177 --> 00:03:17.441
Now we can save.

48
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:22.153
Now we have our navigation type,
let's go make a new navigation.

49
00:03:22.153 --> 00:03:26.278
So we go here, add a new entry,
make a new navigation,

50
00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:31.061
we'll call this one the header,
this the header navigation.

51
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.942
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And as far as the body
buttons go we'll make some new ones.

52
00:03:37.942 --> 00:03:39.553
So what do we have so far?

53
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:45.703
We have, not this,
we have about integrations,

54
00:03:45.703 --> 00:03:49.594
pricing, customers change log.

55
00:03:49.594 --> 00:03:52.593
So I'll just write those, for
now, I'll write those five and

56
00:03:52.593 --> 00:03:55.268
then we can change them and
see, wow, what the vibe is.

57
00:03:55.268 --> 00:04:00.624
So about Integrations
pricing customers change log.

58
00:04:00.624 --> 00:04:06.938
Let's do that, so add this,
so no, pick a new one.

59
00:04:06.938 --> 00:04:14.325
There we go, so I'll say /about, easy.

60
00:04:14.325 --> 00:04:19.195
And then, what was the other one?

61
00:04:19.195 --> 00:04:23.450
Integration or something?

62
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:30.538
Integrations,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: About that,

63
00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:34.516
we have pricing

64
00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:43.793
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We have customers, I think.

65
00:04:47.886 --> 00:04:49.316
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Customers.

66
00:04:52.684 --> 00:04:55.456
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And last one is change log.

67
00:04:58.576 --> 00:04:59.590
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Oops,

68
00:05:07.946 --> 00:05:09.416
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go,

69
00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:11.829
hope this does work.

70
00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:16.492
All right, so now we have our, navigation,

71
00:05:16.492 --> 00:05:20.556
cold header, and we got some buttons.

72
00:05:20.556 --> 00:05:23.227
I'm gonna publish this.

73
00:05:23.227 --> 00:05:29.782
Easy, I'm now gonna go to my explorer.

74
00:05:29.782 --> 00:05:36.523
Wipe all this out, and
I'm going to query for that.

75
00:05:36.523 --> 00:05:37.478
This thing busted.

76
00:05:39.771 --> 00:05:41.826
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There it is.

77
00:05:41.826 --> 00:05:47.805
So here we go, I have navigation,
the navigation collection.

78
00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:52.745
I'm gonna say, find me a navigation where

79
00:05:52.745 --> 00:05:57.283
the name and an exact match on the name.

80
00:05:57.283 --> 00:06:01.665
So I'm gonna do that,
I don't know what this title thing is.

81
00:06:01.665 --> 00:06:03.926
Get rid of that, it's from the last one.

82
00:06:03.926 --> 00:06:10.378
And then I wanna get the items,
of course, and I want to get the name.

83
00:06:10.378 --> 00:06:15.834
But specifically, I wanna get the links,
that's the important part and

84
00:06:15.834 --> 00:06:19.979
get the items of that and
then get the label and the link.

85
00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:25.126
So if I run that and then put a name

86
00:06:25.126 --> 00:06:29.898
here of header, there we go.

87
00:06:29.898 --> 00:06:35.234
Get our navigation header,
get our links and the labels, good to go.

88
00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:43.381
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Using a LSCMS to manage
links is actually a really great use case

89
00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:48.393
because if you write a lot of blog
content and you have links that are going

90
00:06:48.393 --> 00:06:53.927
out it's really hard to keep track of
whether or not, if those things are dead.

91
00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:57.821
If they link to something that is no
longer published on the internet,

92
00:06:57.821 --> 00:06:59.341
you wanna know about that.

93
00:06:59.341 --> 00:07:01.748
So keeping track of the links, and

94
00:07:01.748 --> 00:07:06.728
some collection on the headless CMS
allows you to change them once, and

95
00:07:06.728 --> 00:07:11.379
have it propagate throughout your
whole site if that link is dead.

96
00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:15.748
I'm surprised a lot of CMSs just don't
have features which if there's a special

97
00:07:15.748 --> 00:07:19.344
type called a link, and
then on some interval, it can try to like,

98
00:07:19.344 --> 00:07:23.967
it'll tell you if that link is dead,
it'll be like, this thing is like 400 or

99
00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:26.634
500, you should probably change this link.

100
00:07:26.634 --> 00:07:29.161
That'd be really cool, so I think that's,

101
00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:31.886
that's a really big thing
when it comes to like,

102
00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:36.423
people who are actually making serious
money off of the content that they write.

103
00:07:36.423 --> 00:07:41.270
Links are very important for
SEO, so it could be pretty cool.

104
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.552
Let's go ahead and copy this,

105
00:07:44.552 --> 00:07:50.368
gonna head over to our queries file,
make a new query.

106
00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:01.952
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: GetContentForHeaderNav.

107
00:08:06.117 --> 00:08:10.408
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Got my query here.

108
00:08:18.518 --> 00:08:22.243
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Paste this in,
there we go, one more.

109
00:08:22.243 --> 00:08:27.859
There we go, so we got that,

110
00:08:27.859 --> 00:08:36.529
make a call to our
little helper functions.

111
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:41.091
I'm gonna just copy this, since it's
pretty much the same everywhere,

112
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:43.018
just the types are different.

113
00:08:43.018 --> 00:08:46.753
So we'll do that, we'll go make a new
type, obviously that's not gonna work.

114
00:08:46.753 --> 00:08:53.069
Our variables are going to be name and
the value is gonna be header.

115
00:08:53.069 --> 00:08:55.224
At least that's what I called mine,
yours might be different.

116
00:08:58.211 --> 00:08:59.688
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
then I just need to go make a new type,

117
00:08:59.688 --> 00:09:01.695
that's not gonna work here,
so I'm gonna grab this.

118
00:09:05.198 --> 00:09:06.527
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Go to my types.

119
00:09:08.606 --> 00:09:13.720
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Make a new one,
export type,

120
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:19.048
this will be HeaderNavQuery.

121
00:09:25.491 --> 00:09:29.729
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
this is an object type,

122
00:09:29.729 --> 00:09:33.648
this is an object of arrays.

123
00:09:37.031 --> 00:09:42.491
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is a string,
this is an object,

124
00:09:42.491 --> 00:09:46.725
this is an object of arrays.

125
00:09:46.725 --> 00:09:49.837
This is a string, and this is a string.

126
00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:57.259
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, got our
HeaderNavQuery, gonna bring that in.

127
00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:01.642
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: From our types import and

128
00:10:01.642 --> 00:10:06.667
just put that down here [INAUDIBLE] now,
we are good to go.

129
00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:08.637
Got the same thing that we had in Apollo.

130
00:10:14.182 --> 00:10:20.007
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so now what we
need to do is, this is a server component,

131
00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:24.315
so we should be able to run
an async function here.

132
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.568
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we'll say data = await

133
00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:42.797
getContentForHeaderNav.

134
00:10:42.797 --> 00:10:45.495
And let's actually scope this down.

135
00:10:45.495 --> 00:10:49.973
So content equals
data.navigationcollection.items,

136
00:10:49.973 --> 00:10:53.201
grab the first one, that's what we want.

137
00:10:55.655 --> 00:11:00.041
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And really, we just
want the links, so I'm just gonna say,

138
00:11:00.041 --> 00:11:01.421
give me the links.

139
00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:06.970
This will be linkscollection.items.

140
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.187
That's what I want the links.

141
00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:14.645
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, now I got the links.

142
00:11:14.645 --> 00:11:19.328
I'm gonna just keep just this one and
get rid of all the other ones.

143
00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:25.891
So I command x that, so
it's in my paste bin or my copy buffer.

144
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:30.854
Just need one, put this one back.

145
00:11:30.854 --> 00:11:35.030
And do this, so links.map,

146
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:40.546
get a link and then we put that in there.

147
00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:46.648
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Link.label.

148
00:11:53.626 --> 00:11:58.609
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Link.label, so
this should at least make the call.

149
00:11:58.609 --> 00:12:01.792
I think we're gonna run into an issue
if you haven't saved it already,

150
00:12:01.792 --> 00:12:03.076
you might have ran into one.

151
00:12:03.076 --> 00:12:08.063
Let's see, I think this one,
I've been saying, there's gonna be issue,

152
00:12:08.063 --> 00:12:10.282
I actually think this is the one.

153
00:12:10.282 --> 00:12:12.259
Well, I guess I gotta start
the server first, no.

154
00:12:18.615 --> 00:12:19.756
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Try that.

155
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:27.095
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes, thank you, okay.

156
00:12:27.095 --> 00:12:27.970
Did it show it?

157
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.319
I'm gonna actually see the error.

158
00:12:36.108 --> 00:12:39.423
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, maybe the error
is in the console, there it is.

159
00:12:39.423 --> 00:12:41.992
Okay, that's all I was looking for.

160
00:12:41.992 --> 00:12:46.228
So, couple things,
I'm glad we ran into this error.

161
00:12:46.228 --> 00:12:51.779
So first of all, if we're getting
content on the server side,

162
00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:55.359
why is the error on the browser console?

163
00:12:55.359 --> 00:12:57.657
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Trying to run in both or
something.

164
00:12:57.657 --> 00:12:58.404
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, for

165
00:12:58.404 --> 00:13:02.555
some reason the code that we just
wrote to get the content for

166
00:13:02.555 --> 00:13:08.134
the nav is being executed on the client,
even though it's a server component.

167
00:13:08.134 --> 00:13:11.026
So what we can do is we can make
an enforcement right quick,

168
00:13:11.026 --> 00:13:14.921
so if we go into our queries, this isn't
gonna fix the error but this is going to

169
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:18.192
give us a better error and
then I'll show you how we fix the error.

170
00:13:18.192 --> 00:13:18.871
But this is important

171
00:13:18.871 --> 00:13:20.916
because this is something that you
run into a lot with next year.

172
00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:25.979
So, one of the things we want to
install or should already be installed,

173
00:13:25.979 --> 00:13:30.131
but the thing we wanna use is
something called server only.

174
00:13:30.131 --> 00:13:33.103
So if you import that at
the top of the queries, this,

175
00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:35.812
whenever this file is
imported in a client file,

176
00:13:35.812 --> 00:13:40.324
it's not going to throw an error saying,
you cannot use this file on the client.

177
00:13:40.324 --> 00:13:43.728
And that's, we don't want this file,
this is useful cuz now we'll be

178
00:13:43.728 --> 00:13:46.298
able to figure out who's
trying to import this file?

179
00:13:46.298 --> 00:13:48.093
Why is it throwing an error?

180
00:13:48.093 --> 00:13:50.442
There's the error that
I was trying to get.

181
00:13:50.442 --> 00:13:54.913
It's now you can see that like it
tells you one of these Is marked as

182
00:13:54.913 --> 00:13:57.199
a client entry with used client.

183
00:13:57.199 --> 00:13:59.889
It's either this file, and
I know it's not that file,

184
00:13:59.889 --> 00:14:02.762
I'll just put it server only at the top,
so it's not that.

185
00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:04.809
It's the header file,
I know it's not that file.

186
00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:07.621
That's where we just made
the call to get the query and

187
00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:11.008
I said that's a server component,
so it's gotta be this file.

188
00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:13.349
It's gotta be this layout file, right?

189
00:14:13.349 --> 00:14:18.008
And as you would know,
it is the layout file is a use effect.

190
00:14:18.008 --> 00:14:23.034
So, the reason this layout file has
a use effect in it from the creator

191
00:14:23.034 --> 00:14:27.457
of this template was specifically
just to initialize this,

192
00:14:27.457 --> 00:14:30.511
which has a lot to do with the animations.

193
00:14:30.511 --> 00:14:32.374
It just literally just does animations.

194
00:14:32.374 --> 00:14:35.840
So we'll fix this by doing something
that's gonna not really change

195
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.701
the behavior, but it will fix this.

196
00:14:37.701 --> 00:14:42.386
So, all we're gonna do is
make another component, and

197
00:14:42.386 --> 00:14:49.080
I'm just gonna call it animate.tsx like
this and I'm just gonna say animate.

198
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:56.295
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's gonna export default,
animate.

199
00:14:59.721 --> 00:15:04.152
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's gonna be
a client component, so use client.

200
00:15:04.152 --> 00:15:07.494
And all I'm gonna do is
go back to that layout,

201
00:15:07.494 --> 00:15:13.166
I'm gonna take this code that it's
using here, so it's importing from AOS.

202
00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:16.385
I'm gonna take that,
I'll put that in here,

203
00:15:16.385 --> 00:15:19.371
it wants a use effect, I'll import that.

204
00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:25.647
I'm just gonna take this use effect out,
so it's no longer in the layout.

205
00:15:25.647 --> 00:15:29.279
I'm gonna put it here in the animate and
just have the animate return null.

206
00:15:34.205 --> 00:15:38.660
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Doesn't return anything on
the page, it just runs this use effect.

207
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.345
And then now, when I go down here,
above my header,

208
00:15:43.345 --> 00:15:47.932
I'll just,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Bringing in this

209
00:15:47.932 --> 00:15:49.186
anime like that.

210
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.483
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So If we go back,

211
00:15:58.483 --> 00:16:04.474
let's see if this fixes anything.

212
00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:06.992
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I use client for the layout.

213
00:16:06.992 --> 00:16:10.162
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, yeah and
then take that off, there you go.

214
00:16:10.162 --> 00:16:14.215
Cool, cool, and there we go,
it works just fine.

215
00:16:14.215 --> 00:16:19.111
So just moving that out of the layout
allowed us to make the layout a server

216
00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:24.257
component, so then we did just make
that one component a client component.

217
00:16:24.257 --> 00:16:28.964
This just strategy that the next day's
team recommends you take going forward is

218
00:16:28.964 --> 00:16:31.316
just like, don't make an entire page or

219
00:16:31.316 --> 00:16:35.973
layout a client component because there's
one piece that needs to be a client.

220
00:16:35.973 --> 00:16:38.405
Just move that specific thing
to its own component and

221
00:16:38.405 --> 00:16:39.925
let everything else be a server.

222
00:16:39.925 --> 00:16:44.652
So just push the client stuff
down the tree as far as you can.

223
00:16:44.652 --> 00:16:50.086
So you have, in reality, you should have
like these bigger server components and

224
00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:52.696
these tiny little client components.

225
00:16:52.696 --> 00:16:58.459
And that's how it should be, so,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,

226
00:16:58.459 --> 00:17:03.451
we did that, now let's check to see if
this is working the way we thought it was.

227
00:17:03.451 --> 00:17:08.051
So what we'll do is we'll go to our CMS
and we have about integrations, pricing,

228
00:17:08.051 --> 00:17:09.399
customers change law.

229
00:17:09.399 --> 00:17:11.640
Is that the order that we see there?

230
00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.171
About integrations, it is,
okay, let's change the order.

231
00:17:15.171 --> 00:17:20.671
And let's see what happens if
I want to put about down here,

232
00:17:20.671 --> 00:17:22.874
I hit publish changes.

233
00:17:22.874 --> 00:17:27.344
I go back to here,
I do a heart refresh and

234
00:17:27.344 --> 00:17:30.770
yeah, about is over here now.

235
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:33.707
So that's how you can move
things around the page,

236
00:17:33.707 --> 00:17:35.973
you can sort them in any order you want.

237
00:17:35.973 --> 00:17:39.599
If you want to give that person the power
to do that, that's how you would do it.

238
00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:42.644
And this is just for
links in a navigation,

239
00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:45.444
you could do whole sections like that.

240
00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:49.494
You could say, all right,
I'm gonna make each one of these sections,

241
00:17:49.494 --> 00:17:51.707
they don't even have to be the same type,

242
00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:55.155
cuz you can make an array of
multiple different types of things.

243
00:17:55.155 --> 00:18:00.128
But each one of these sections is gonna
be on a field somewhere on the home page

244
00:18:00.128 --> 00:18:03.935
that's a list type and
then that way the person can drag and

245
00:18:03.935 --> 00:18:07.686
drop the sections in whatever
order they want them to be.

246
00:18:07.686 --> 00:18:12.295
You would need tons of coordination with
your designer because you would have to

247
00:18:12.295 --> 00:18:15.183
make sure those sections
as far as their layout and

248
00:18:15.183 --> 00:18:17.897
design aren't dependent on something else.

249
00:18:17.897 --> 00:18:21.891
Like for instance, there's a lot
of dependent design on this app,

250
00:18:21.891 --> 00:18:25.337
like how things bleed into each other and
how they don't.

251
00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:28.922
Like for instance, these right here
like kinda bleed into each other.

252
00:18:28.922 --> 00:18:30.163
So like moving it and

253
00:18:30.163 --> 00:18:34.472
putting it somewhere else might mess
up the design that was intended.

254
00:18:34.472 --> 00:18:40.550
So you have to like really think about
that, but it's definitely a possibility.
