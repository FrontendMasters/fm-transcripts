00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.379
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There are some more
advanced use cases for sure, but

2
00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:05.791
they start to lean into
CMS specific stuff.

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:11.000
And I just didn't wanna get into
that because there isn't a standard.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.094
At one point,
we were trying to make a standard of,

5
00:00:13.094 --> 00:00:16.340
here's what all the data should
look like from every headless CMS.

6
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.564
And we went around to every headless
CMS covers let's make it standard.

7
00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:19.810
Nobody wanted to do it.

8
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.322
They just wanted to do it their own way.

9
00:00:21.322 --> 00:00:22.739
And I was, no, we should make a standard.

10
00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.689
So if someone wants to turn off
your site and go to another site,

11
00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:27.536
they could bring their data with them.

12
00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:28.909
And that was the thing
they didn't wanna do.

13
00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.109
They wanted to get keep.

14
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.059
So I thought that was great.

15
00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.096
We all could have benefited from it.

16
00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:35.369
So there isn't a standard on
what this should look like.

17
00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.325
Everyone has their own opinions.

18
00:00:36.325 --> 00:00:40.211
So, I try to be non-biased whenever.

19
00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:43.292
When I have to use products with
the courses that I teach, but for

20
00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:46.921
the most part, the advanced use
cases are very platform specific.

21
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:51.431
But what I showed you today is 80% of
what a headless CMS is and how it works.

22
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:53.443
And there really isn't
much more to it than that.

23
00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:55.641
So I covered those things.

24
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:59.898
If there's any questions about
headless CMS, next JS or

25
00:00:59.898 --> 00:01:04.129
really anything related to
adjacent to any of that.

26
00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:04.903
I'm here for it.

27
00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:08.216
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Scott.

28
00:01:08.216 --> 00:01:08.812
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes.

29
00:01:08.812 --> 00:01:11.604
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Pretty broad question.

30
00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:15.008
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's toxin really
interesting because it seems CMS is

31
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:19.129
largely also a structural or
team dependent kind of problem.

32
00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:21.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
In your experience,

33
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.453
what are some good rules of thumb
they kinda follow when kind of

34
00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:30.560
configuring what the content team
has access to versus the developers.

35
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.471
And I know this is probably really
dependent on how technical the content

36
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:34.626
team is and stuff like that.

37
00:01:34.626 --> 00:01:38.690
But are there kind of things
that in your experience

38
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.384
are good practices to
follow more generally?

39
00:01:42.384 --> 00:01:46.943
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yes,
if your CMS has roles, enable the roles.

40
00:01:46.943 --> 00:01:49.893
Do not let the content
people mess with the models.

41
00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:51.363
Your app's gonna break.

42
00:01:51.363 --> 00:01:54.942
If you let the mess with the models
is broken coz you are banking on

43
00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:58.265
the fact that the concept's
gonna come back in this shape.

44
00:01:58.265 --> 00:02:01.872
Your code is not, we didn't put no checks
to make sure that field was available or

45
00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:05.824
not, because obviously GraphQL would
have thrown an error if it wasn't.

46
00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:09.503
But so don't let constant
people touch the models at all,

47
00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:14.564
which is why a lot of the open source
CMSs, you write the model in the code now.

48
00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:17.114
It's a JSON file, so they can't touch it.

49
00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:19.260
When we built our CMS, that's what we did.

50
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.016
I think if you're one of the first ones
that did that, we're, no, take it out,

51
00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:26.480
write the model as just pure JSON,
and then we'd interpret that.

52
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.350
We basically took a model a JSON file and
turned that into an app.

53
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.901
So you give us a JSON schema,
we turn that into a full blown app for

54
00:02:32.901 --> 00:02:34.400
your content team, right?

55
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.177
So don't do that.

56
00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:41.912
The second thing is,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: From my

57
00:02:41.912 --> 00:02:45.667
experience being an engineer
developing a content model for

58
00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:50.514
a content team is being a founder
trying to find product market fit.

59
00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:53.575
If you are sick and
tired of managing concepts engineering,

60
00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.374
you really wanna empower
your content team.

61
00:02:56.374 --> 00:03:00.538
You're gonna have to act like a founder
and sit down with your content team and

62
00:03:00.538 --> 00:03:01.896
go and watch them use it.

63
00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:06.036
And see what they struggle on and see how
you can improve the schema, how you can

64
00:03:06.036 --> 00:03:10.903
improve the model, maybe change this field
UI, maybe change the name of this label.

65
00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:14.613
You really got to figure out why
is this really hard for them.

66
00:03:14.613 --> 00:03:17.385
Why don't they use it, why are they
still slacking me to do this thing when

67
00:03:17.385 --> 00:03:20.201
I already showed them how to do the thing
and it's you just got to sit down and

68
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:21.743
watch them, just like a founder would.

69
00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:26.687
Eventually you'll figure out what's the
root issue, and you will eventually hit

70
00:03:26.687 --> 00:03:31.627
this road where you have to sacrifice what
is best for your app, for what's best for

71
00:03:31.627 --> 00:03:35.740
the content team, and
just go make it work for the content team.

72
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.830
You can write code for it.

73
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.260
Just write the code you got to fix it.

74
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.161
Just make them happy coz at the end of the
day, it's gonna make you happy because for

75
00:03:43.161 --> 00:03:45.820
the most part,
they'll just keep contacting you.

76
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.033
They'll just keep hitting you,
hey, can you do the thing?

77
00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:50.223
And you're, my God, okay?

78
00:03:50.223 --> 00:03:52.182
And it's nobody's fault, but yours,

79
00:03:52.182 --> 00:03:55.760
because you didn't sit down to kinda
figure out what it is that they need.

80
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.983
And that's just kinda
the unfortunate thing, honestly.

81
00:03:57.983 --> 00:04:02.204
It's really tough because it's just
a headless CMS has to be integrated by

82
00:04:02.204 --> 00:04:06.927
a developer, but it's mostly used by
someone who didn't do the integration.

83
00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:10.060
So those two people have to
communicate at some point,

84
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.895
there has to be some communication there,
unless you have a growth engineer who sits

85
00:04:14.895 --> 00:04:18.388
on the marketing team and
also sits on the engineering team.

86
00:04:18.388 --> 00:04:22.172
And they're the liaison between two groups
and they can kind of just do everything.

87
00:04:23.172 --> 00:04:26.434
You need some type of communication,
some planning and coordination there.

88
00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:28.502
So I would say that.

89
00:04:28.502 --> 00:04:31.832
And then lastly, start slow.

90
00:04:31.832 --> 00:04:38.103
Don't go in and just I know exactly how
to make all the schemas for everything.

91
00:04:38.103 --> 00:04:41.446
And I'm just gonna go in and
do everything no do what we just did.

92
00:04:41.446 --> 00:04:44.096
Pick one title, pick one thing.

93
00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:45.876
Make that dynamic.

94
00:04:45.876 --> 00:04:48.899
Give it to someone like cool,
you can change that thing now,

95
00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:52.058
just that one thing you can change it,
let them warm up to that.

96
00:04:52.058 --> 00:04:55.193
And then go out another thing and then add
another thing and add another thing is

97
00:04:55.193 --> 00:04:58.347
slowly you start to do that way they're
learning they're getting used to it.

98
00:04:58.347 --> 00:05:01.870
At the same time, you don't have to
just do all the stuff up front, right?

99
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.777
And you can kinda go as you please.

100
00:05:03.777 --> 00:05:07.222
So I would just adopt it that way.

101
00:05:07.222 --> 00:05:12.618
It's a lot slower, but I think it leads
to higher, it just makes it more sticky.

102
00:05:12.618 --> 00:05:16.947
I think people stick with the product
a lot more when they adopt it that way,

103
00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:21.483
whereas if you get these weird signals
where someone will dial the CMS engineer

104
00:05:21.483 --> 00:05:23.424
super excited about it.

105
00:05:23.424 --> 00:05:26.894
And it looks like a good signal and
they just built integration super quick.

106
00:05:26.894 --> 00:05:29.974
But then it hurts the content
team coz they did so much.

107
00:05:29.974 --> 00:05:33.314
The company was overwhelmed with
everything that the engineers did.

108
00:05:33.314 --> 00:05:35.982
Whereas the inverse is true,
it's the engineers

109
00:05:35.982 --> 00:05:39.932
taking their time they only added one
field, they only do this one thing.

110
00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:43.696
But that one feels getting changed 10
times a week, coz it kinda seems it's so

111
00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:44.877
easy for them.

112
00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:48.192
So [LAUGH] it's so weird these
are the things that I observed.

113
00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:52.637
So those are some of the tips.

114
00:05:52.637 --> 00:05:53.137
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Gotcha.

115
00:05:53.137 --> 00:05:57.357
Thank you,
Gamify the content editors journey.

116
00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.269
They get it achievements along the way.

117
00:05:59.269 --> 00:06:00.519
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's [LAUGH].

118
00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.334
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, [LAUGH] Pretty much.

119
00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:04.114
Well, I think that's it.

120
00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:06.284
Wanna appreciate everybody for coming.

121
00:06:06.284 --> 00:06:07.562
This course was super fun.

122
00:06:07.562 --> 00:06:12.364
It was kinda nostalgic just walking down
this path again, seeing how [LAUGH] deep

123
00:06:12.364 --> 00:06:16.534
and dedicated I was for, have the CMS for
about four years of my life.

124
00:06:16.534 --> 00:06:18.329
So, it felt kind of fun.

125
00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:21.760
So thanks for entertaining me, and
I hope you guys got some value from this.

126
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.127
