00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.911
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: First thing,
let's just make sure everyone gets set up,

2
00:00:01.911 --> 00:00:03.005
I'm just gonna walk through it.

3
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.507
So, everyone is on the same page,
make sure you do an MPM install that,

4
00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.696
should install a bunch of things.

5
00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:13.634
Hopefully, that doesn't break for anybody,
and then as far as like, to start,

6
00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:14.730
you can do MPM run dev.

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.476
So, if you run that,

8
00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:22.410
it's just gonna run the next dev
that's gonna start it on the 3000.

9
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.945
And you're gonna see
what I just showed you.

10
00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:29.592
So, let me go back to my browser,
you're gonna see this.

11
00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:35.245
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Folks are asking
where do you get the theme.

12
00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:36.619
Which theme, my editor theme?

13
00:00:36.619 --> 00:00:38.862
&gt;&gt; Student: No, the website.

14
00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:39.366
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The website?

15
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.035
&gt;&gt; Student: Where did you
end up buying it from?

16
00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:42.734
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
where did I buy this from?

17
00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:50.084
It's Crew Whip, Crew Whip,
I think that's how you pronounce it.

18
00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:50.755
&gt;&gt; Student: Cruip.

19
00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:54.942
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cruip.com,
there it is right there.

20
00:00:54.942 --> 00:00:58.321
They have a bunch of stuff, I think,
I have a subscription with them so

21
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:00.111
I can just download whatever I want.

22
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:03.357
But I think you could buy it one off if
you want, they're actually really good.

23
00:01:03.357 --> 00:01:07.163
They have them in different languages,
and typically, if you buy some of these,

24
00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:08.551
it's like, who wrote this?

25
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:10.807
I would never do it this way, but

26
00:01:10.807 --> 00:01:16.171
the person that wrote this wrote it in
the way that like most like you should.

27
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:18.123
They did it at the app directory,

28
00:01:18.123 --> 00:01:22.450
they did the all the different opinions
that the community has adopted and

29
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.103
all the different standards
they follow the best practices.

30
00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:28.227
I was pretty impressed.

31
00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:31.333
I thought I was gonna download it and
just throw it all away, honestly, but

32
00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.709
I didn't really have to do anything other
than strip out the hard coded content.

33
00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.841
So it's very, very useful.

34
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:39.537
But let's just tour the app right quick,
let's get a feel for it, right?

35
00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:41.829
So, let's check out,
let's see what we're gonna be doing.

36
00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.074
There's a lot going on here, right?

37
00:01:43.074 --> 00:01:47.777
We have these sections stacked on top of
each other, like a traditional website.

38
00:01:47.777 --> 00:01:54.789
We got a hero, we got this
scrolling carousel of ego, logos.

39
00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.577
We have, I guess you would call this
like a feature section where when

40
00:01:58.577 --> 00:02:01.595
you click on this,
the thing kinda changes over here.

41
00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:05.450
So there's some correlation
between these pieces of content.

42
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.266
We have another feature section that
has like this bento box UI that

43
00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:14.839
have some standardization around
the shape of their content.

44
00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:19.810
You have a title, subtitle, CTA, all that
type of stuff, you have your grid here

45
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.226
of just your listing all your features,
and that's just the homepage.

46
00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:28.898
And it's still going, there's a pricing
page too, so we have a lot of that.

47
00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:33.302
There's this change log here, which is,
I guess you could think this is like,

48
00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:37.379
it's not like a block cuz they actually
have something like that on here,

49
00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.391
we'll see that.

50
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:42.433
This is more like an updates,
I guess you just show a bunch of updates,

51
00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:46.356
but really obviously, it's to
change the change log for this app.

52
00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:49.729
A lot of startups are starting to
put their change logs on their apps,

53
00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.192
which I think is really cool.

54
00:02:51.192 --> 00:02:55.051
So this one's really cool, you can see
something like, someone on the content

55
00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:58.348
team coming here, or this is
something a product manager might do.

56
00:02:58.348 --> 00:03:02.200
The product manager might log into
the CMS when they do a new release,

57
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.470
add a new update here.

58
00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.898
So that's really cool,
there's this customers page here that,

59
00:03:07.898 --> 00:03:10.279
this one acts very much like a blog.

60
00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:15.751
So they have like their
customers that have their logos,

61
00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:20.539
and when you click on one,
so if I click on Airbnb,

62
00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:27.391
it takes you to a post that talks
about how Airbnb uses this technology.

63
00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:29.891
So it's kinda like a blog post,
so this kinda acts like a blog.

64
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:35.430
So we can work with that, there's some
interesting things going on there.

65
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.338
We even have like, navigation, so just
being able to have these links up here,

66
00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:45.051
have them in this order, navigating
through these pages with these names.

67
00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:47.944
We have a footer that
has tons of navigations,

68
00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:49.954
there's a lot of content here.

69
00:03:49.954 --> 00:03:54.234
There's so much that you can
enable someone other than

70
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:58.793
yourself to be responsible for,
and it's not just text,

71
00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:03.928
it goes well beyond just text as
you're gonna see in this course.

72
00:04:03.928 --> 00:04:08.757
So, hopefully I can cover some of
the more interesting things along with

73
00:04:08.757 --> 00:04:11.774
some of the commenting, so that's my goal.
