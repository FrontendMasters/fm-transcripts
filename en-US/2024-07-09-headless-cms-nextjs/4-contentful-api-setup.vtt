1
00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:03.631
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so
thought exercise, let's go through and

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:08.881
figure out the shape and the things that
we wanna change and stuff like that.

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:12.941
And that way we're gonna come back here,
create our first content model,

4
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.853
add some content, pull it down and
see what happens.

5
00:00:15.853 --> 00:00:17.451
So I'm gonna go to the website.

6
00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.177
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Wanna go to the homepage.

7
00:00:22.177 --> 00:00:24.512
And we'll start with the hero.

8
00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:27.152
So if we start with the hero,

9
00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:33.208
what are some things here on the hero
that we need to make dynamic?

10
00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:37.147
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Title description links.

11
00:00:37.147 --> 00:00:38.781
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Title description.

12
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.329
You say links, do you mean like these
links or do you mean these links?

13
00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.819
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They like
to call the action-

14
00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.393
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The CTAs, okay?

15
00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:48.417
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Those two and the one above.

16
00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:50.347
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This one too?

17
00:00:50.347 --> 00:00:53.415
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Assuming you consider
that part of the hero I guess.

18
00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:57.576
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, everything from
here to here does that move, yeah,

19
00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:03.416
that's not fixed so, yeah, even the logo
and even the sign in and sign up buttons.

20
00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:07.682
This is where you have to decide,
should they, when I say they,

21
00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:12.659
should be technical, the non technical
folks on your team have the ability

22
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.296
to change what this button says,
or this button says?

23
00:01:16.296 --> 00:01:19.806
Or what order they're in, or what color
they are, or what icon they have, or

24
00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:23.326
whether or not this one has a border,
or whether or not it's here or not here?

25
00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:24.309
And what logo it is.

26
00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:25.810
So you have to think about that, right?

27
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.448
And that's where it does get complicated
cuz you might even have to sit down with

28
00:01:29.448 --> 00:01:32.720
your content team like, all right,
what do y'all wanna be able to do?

29
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.991
And you might give them all this power,
which is like giving someone like a magic

30
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:39.754
wand, but
like they don't know any of the spells.

31
00:01:39.754 --> 00:01:42.509
So it's kind of useless.

32
00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.088
It's like giving a mogul a wand, they're
like, I don't know what to do with this.

33
00:01:47.088 --> 00:01:49.096
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: CMS have roles.

34
00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:49.706
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

35
00:01:49.706 --> 00:01:52.566
[LAUGH] Exactly.

36
00:01:52.566 --> 00:01:54.202
So we're gonna start here.

37
00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:59.283
So I would say for us,
we probably want to be able

38
00:01:59.283 --> 00:02:04.123
to dynamically change these links for
sure.

39
00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:07.661
We want to be able to change the order
of these links, the labels, and

40
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:09.067
the routes that they go to.

41
00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:13.655
We wanna be able to change this,
I guess you could call this a pre-title.

42
00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:15.055
I don't know what the name of this is.

43
00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:19.521
We definitely wanna change the title here,
the description or

44
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:23.579
the subtitle, and
then definitely the call to actions.

45
00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:25.716
Maybe we'll order their in and
then the labels as well.

46
00:02:25.716 --> 00:02:27.878
So I would say at minimum,
we wanna do that.

47
00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:30.892
I probably wouldn't let
folks change the logo out.

48
00:02:30.892 --> 00:02:33.655
I would just put that logo in myself.

49
00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:37.727
And I probably wouldn't let them change
this since this is more like app related

50
00:02:37.727 --> 00:02:39.200
and less about SEO related.

51
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.551
It's like, can you go here and
sign up and sign in.

52
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:46.399
But these things here that I just
talked about are more content related,

53
00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:48.872
more focused on the website itself.

54
00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:51.266
So those are the things
that I would probably do.

55
00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:56.325
So what we can do if we go to our website,
we go into the code,

56
00:02:56.325 --> 00:03:00.705
there's a component called
hero inside of there.

57
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.507
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You're gonna see
all that hard-coded content.

58
00:03:04.507 --> 00:03:07.087
So at one point when I
was working on my CMS,

59
00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:11.766
we wanted to create like a VS Code plugin
that would, or was it ES Lint plugin?

60
00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:15.666
I think it was ES Lint plugin that will
basically throw a Lint error if it

61
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.509
detected hard-coded content
because I was like,

62
00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:23.223
you should never have hard-coded content
anywhere in a React and a static website.

63
00:03:23.223 --> 00:03:24.727
And I still believe that.

64
00:03:24.727 --> 00:03:28.768
Even if you're not using a headless CMS,
there's just no good reason to do this,

65
00:03:28.768 --> 00:03:30.643
you should abstract all of this away,

66
00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:33.944
even if it's just like a static
object somewhere that you pull in.

67
00:03:33.944 --> 00:03:37.445
And that way, you can just change all your
strings in one place without having to go

68
00:03:37.445 --> 00:03:39.286
into all these individual files, right?

69
00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:41.827
So let's take note of where
all these things are.

70
00:03:41.827 --> 00:03:47.600
So that's the pretitle,
we have title here,

71
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.233
we have our subtitle here and
we have our CTA.

72
00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:58.452
So pretty simple, they're all just text,
they're not like some crazy format.

73
00:03:58.452 --> 00:04:03.835
But if we look at the call to actions,
we need a title.

74
00:04:03.835 --> 00:04:07.957
We also need a, where's the href?

75
00:04:07.957 --> 00:04:08.989
We need an href.

76
00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.337
So where does it go?

77
00:04:10.337 --> 00:04:13.425
So that one's probably more
a little bit more structured.

78
00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:16.763
And for the links,
which are probably gonna be,

79
00:04:16.763 --> 00:04:20.033
somewhere else in the layout,
I'm guessing.

80
00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:23.700
We also want to have some structure
there because they have a name,

81
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.693
a route that they go to, and then we
also need to like keep track of order,

82
00:04:27.693 --> 00:04:30.851
what order they're in so
we can change the links around.

83
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:32.569
So there's a lot that's going on.

84
00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.766
So let's get started with that.

85
00:04:34.766 --> 00:04:42.018
First thing I'm gonna do is this website,
it's using something called content layer.

86
00:04:42.018 --> 00:04:46.217
I think content layer is dead, but
basically what it is, it's like a tool

87
00:04:46.217 --> 00:04:50.576
that integrates what CMS is to give you
type safe content, which is a dream.

88
00:04:50.576 --> 00:04:52.305
But I think the project died.

89
00:04:52.305 --> 00:04:55.367
I went to go look them up cuz I
haven't seen them in a while and

90
00:04:55.367 --> 00:04:59.736
they haven't even made an integration for
contempo yet and contempo is like the OG.

91
00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.105
So I think it's kind of dead.

92
00:05:01.105 --> 00:05:01.949
We're not going to use it.

93
00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.690
We're also not gonna
use markdown obviously.

94
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.557
We're gonna put stuff in the CMS,
so I'm just going to take out this,

95
00:05:08.557 --> 00:05:13.356
delete this folder in here called
update inside the content folder.

96
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.096
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If it lets me, delete that.

97
00:05:20.096 --> 00:05:21.318
There we go.

98
00:05:21.318 --> 00:05:25.176
So I'm gonna delete that,
is it gonna delete?

99
00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:28.731
[LAUGH] I'm just gonna delete the whole
content folder how about that?

100
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:29.571
There we go.

101
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:30.290
And then we're just

102
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.543
gonna make another content folder
cuz I wanna use that folder.

103
00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.792
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so this is where we
are gonna put all of our content related

104
00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:47.740
things, so first thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna create a file called fetch.

105
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.046
And we're using typescript.

106
00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:52.159
If you don't know Typescript,
that's fine, it's optional.

107
00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.263
But the reason I chose Typescript, cuz one
of the biggest issues you're gonna have is

108
00:05:56.263 --> 00:05:59.630
basically what I just talked about
is how do you get type safe content?

109
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.422
I think that's what content
layer was trying to solve.

110
00:06:04.422 --> 00:06:06.682
We're just gonna have to
manually type it ourself.

111
00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:10.233
But because we're gonna be using GraphQL,
it's gonna be super easy,

112
00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:12.081
it's gonna be like a copy and paste.

113
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:15.951
I mean, technically you could
do cogen too if you want it, but

114
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:17.594
we're not gonna do that.

115
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:22.022
To fully rid ourselves of this content
layer integration, we need to go into

116
00:06:22.022 --> 00:06:27.006
the nextConfig, it's using this content
layer middleware or higher order function

117
00:06:27.006 --> 00:06:31.316
just get rid of that, we don't want
to use this with content layer thing.

118
00:06:31.316 --> 00:06:35.314
So you can just tell that thing to go and
just return the nextConfig,

119
00:06:35.314 --> 00:06:39.666
what we wannna do is we, because
graphql doesn't support, i'm sorry,

120
00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:44.530
because contentful doesn't support
Next.js app directory on the server side.

121
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.156
It supports it on the client side, but

122
00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:50.780
that kind of defeats
the purpose of using Next.js.

123
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.677
I wanna get my content on the server
side and statically render it,

124
00:06:53.677 --> 00:06:57.107
I don't wanna have like a client side
app that's like loading for a blog post.

125
00:06:57.107 --> 00:06:58.136
That's gross.

126
00:06:58.136 --> 00:07:01.522
So we're just gonna do it ourselves.

127
00:07:01.522 --> 00:07:07.005
So what we wanna do is I have the URL for
it in my notes.

128
00:07:07.005 --> 00:07:08.641
It's this URL right here.

129
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:14.914
We're gonna create
a GraphQL content feature,

130
00:07:14.914 --> 00:07:19.351
or I'll just say graph, or I'm so

131
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:25.012
bad with names, contentGraphqlFetcher,

132
00:07:25.012 --> 00:07:28.841
something like that, cool.

133
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:30.298
Okay, we'll do that.

134
00:07:30.298 --> 00:07:35.573
And what this is gonna do is it's
just going to make a fetch call.

135
00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:37.737
So I'm gonna say async.

136
00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:40.539
It's going to make a fetch call,
get a response.

137
00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:46.795
So it'll be fetch, which is built into
Next.js, we don't have to import it.

138
00:07:46.795 --> 00:07:49.998
It's going to fetch this URL.

139
00:07:49.998 --> 00:07:53.391
It's in the notes txt if you wanna get it.

140
00:07:53.391 --> 00:07:57.067
It's going to take a spaceId or actually,

141
00:07:57.067 --> 00:08:01.263
no, that's gonna be
an environment variable.

142
00:08:01.263 --> 00:08:04.458
So we don't need to do that, let's just
use the environment variable here.

143
00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:10.981
This will be process.env.,
let me go to my env.

144
00:08:10.981 --> 00:08:14.446
This will be the space,
the CONTENTIFUL_SPACE_ ID.

145
00:08:14.446 --> 00:08:15.381
So we'll just do that.

146
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.791
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

147
00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.425
Got our spaceId.

148
00:08:21.425 --> 00:08:27.095
And we need our config object here,

149
00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:34.088
we're gonna say method is POST, headers.

150
00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:39.564
We will say,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What

151
00:08:39.564 --> 00:08:40.353
is the one I'm looking for?

152
00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.646
It's like- Content type.

153
00:08:41.646 --> 00:08:44.257
There it's, I'm like,
yeah, so content/type.

154
00:08:47.439 --> 00:08:50.684
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Application/json.

155
00:08:54.342 --> 00:08:57.420
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we got that.

156
00:09:01.587 --> 00:09:07.956
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then for the body,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We

157
00:09:07.956 --> 00:09:10.789
need to do json.stringify.

158
00:09:10.789 --> 00:09:14.233
And here, we're gonna take in a query.

159
00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:18.400
So our GraphQL query,
which is gonna be a type of string, and

160
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.299
then possible variables.

161
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.167
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If you have any,
which I'll just make it an object.

162
00:09:29.722 --> 00:09:32.379
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So query for
query, variables for variables.

163
00:09:35.378 --> 00:09:36.159
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We got that.

164
00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:41.655
We also need to pass in the headers.

165
00:09:41.655 --> 00:09:47.491
There's authentication headers that need
to be passed here for conceptual to work.

166
00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:50.944
And depending on if you're
in preview mode or not,

167
00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:55.925
you have to pass a different header,
which makes sense because you don't

168
00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:59.884
wanna accidentally show
preview content on production.

169
00:09:59.884 --> 00:10:03.148
So you have to use a different
authorization secret to switch

170
00:10:03.148 --> 00:10:04.110
between the two.

171
00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.536
So let's get that.

172
00:10:06.536 --> 00:10:09.387
Let me see what the name
of that header was.

173
00:10:09.387 --> 00:10:11.275
I forgot the name of it.

174
00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:13.634
It's literally just an authorization word,
okay.

175
00:10:13.634 --> 00:10:16.816
So we're just gonna say authorization.

176
00:10:20.029 --> 00:10:25.370
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then what we're gonna
do is we're gonna take in an argument here

177
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:31.568
that says preview and that's gonna be
optional it's gonna default to false.

178
00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:41.937
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And you say if there
is a preview then the authorization

179
00:10:41.937 --> 00:10:46.980
is gonna be Bearer
the environment variable from

180
00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.901
the CONTENTIFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN.

181
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:57.397
So we'll say that if it's not preview,

182
00:10:57.397 --> 00:11:05.328
then it'll be Bearer
the CONTENTIFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN.

183
00:11:17.895 --> 00:11:23.155
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, and
I guess I need to do this before I forget.

184
00:11:23.155 --> 00:11:24.323
There you go.

185
00:11:24.323 --> 00:11:27.433
So we have the authorization,
we got our body, we got a query,

186
00:11:27.433 --> 00:11:29.094
we got our potential variables.

187
00:11:29.094 --> 00:11:31.527
So this is something that we're
gonna use just to be able to fetch.

188
00:11:31.527 --> 00:11:35.157
This is literally the only integration
that we're gonna have with Contentful.

189
00:11:35.157 --> 00:11:38.814
So it really is,
as far as the developer integration,

190
00:11:38.814 --> 00:11:41.045
completely agnostic on the CMS.

191
00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:44.462
You're just hitting a URL, so
this could be any other CMS and

192
00:11:44.462 --> 00:11:46.072
it's most likely the same.
