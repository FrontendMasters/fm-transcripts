00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.738
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, so now, some of
the things we wanna think about doing,

2
00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:09.918
I mean, there's just so much more here
that we could add if we wanted to.

3
00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:12.734
But I think for the most part, it's
very similar to what we've already done.

4
00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:17.036
If you wanted to add in, I guess,
these testimonials and stuff like that,

5
00:00:17.036 --> 00:00:19.651
we could do that, but
it's more of the same.

6
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:23.987
Kind of what we already did, so
let's move into something newer.

7
00:00:23.987 --> 00:00:28.770
So we have this concept
of these customers.

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.962
They have their logos, and
then when you click on it,

9
00:00:32.962 --> 00:00:35.391
there is a testimony about it.

10
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:36.954
It's the same one for every single one.

11
00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:39.730
It's just one random
one that's got created.

12
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.786
They have this testimony here.

13
00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:47.986
What we wanna do is we
want this to be dynamic.

14
00:00:47.986 --> 00:00:53.523
So we wanna be able to eventually
load in all these customers.

15
00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:58.122
This one's kinda hard, because the design
in which they laid it out is broken up by

16
00:00:58.122 --> 00:00:59.668
these other widgets here.

17
00:00:59.668 --> 00:01:01.079
So if were to look at this,

18
00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.362
I would imagine it's not just
them looping over something.

19
00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:07.771
There's some stopping and then another
loop and then some more stopping.

20
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:10.941
So you'd have to have specific list for
that.

21
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:15.765
You might make a list for
left customers, middle customers,

22
00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:19.212
right customers, or something like that.

23
00:01:19.212 --> 00:01:21.968
And that way, they can cut kinda
control it, or even this way,

24
00:01:21.968 --> 00:01:23.172
cuz it's kinda broken up.

25
00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:24.500
So that was a little more complicated.

26
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.208
This is where it starts to break down when
you have these complicated designs for

27
00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.750
the content people.

28
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.539
But what I wanna do is I wanna be
able to go to slash customers and

29
00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.775
have a slug be up here, any slug, right?

30
00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:45.391
And it loads up that customer's use case,
I guess, that's what these are called.

31
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:46.927
These are use cases.

32
00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:51.907
And I want the people on my team to be
able to edit these use cases with a rich

33
00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:54.930
text editor and
then have it be rendered here

34
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.764
with the same formatting that the rich
text editor allowed them to do.

35
00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:02.805
So if they do links, they do bold.

36
00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:05.892
If they do headers,
if they do block quotes,

37
00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:10.056
I want all that to be rendered
here without me having to do it.

38
00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:10.905
So we wanna do that.

39
00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:14.363
So there's a couple of things
we need to do to enable that.

40
00:02:14.363 --> 00:02:16.152
One, we have to think about this.

41
00:02:16.152 --> 00:02:20.897
This is gonna be a static site.

42
00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:25.153
If this is gonna be a static site,
that means you would need to

43
00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:30.088
pre-render every possible post that
you have ahead of time, right?

44
00:02:30.088 --> 00:02:32.960
Cuz how else would it be there when
someone went to it if they didn't

45
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.153
get built if it's static?

46
00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:39.030
It's not gonna be, I mean, you could, just
not to stop me from making it just be like

47
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.584
a paste that hits the server every single
time, and then just rely on caching.

48
00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:47.874
But the only interactions you have on here
are links that don't need JavaScript.

49
00:02:47.874 --> 00:02:52.078
So you should probably
statically render this page.

50
00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:53.931
And if that's the case,

51
00:02:53.931 --> 00:02:58.797
you need to statically render
every possible page ahead of time.

52
00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:03.331
There are ways where you can just do,
let's say you have 200 E's and rendering

53
00:03:03.331 --> 00:03:08.075
200 of them is really slow during bill,
so maybe just wanna render the first 10.

54
00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:13.432
And then you still show the links for
the other 190.

55
00:03:13.432 --> 00:03:17.291
When someone clicks on the link,
then that one will get rendered then.

56
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:19.297
And if someone clicks on the same link,
it's already rendered.

57
00:03:19.297 --> 00:03:21.917
So it's rendered on demand for
the first time.

58
00:03:21.917 --> 00:03:23.194
So that's a way you can do it.

59
00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:25.341
It was really easy to do
that at page's directory.

60
00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:29.094
Do that in the app directory
is a little more difficult, so

61
00:03:29.094 --> 00:03:31.862
we need to first create our content model.

62
00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:32.809
We need slugs.

63
00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.896
We need to be able to get all
the possible slugs that are out there.

64
00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:38.411
And then we need to be able to generate,

65
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:43.218
we need to tell Next.js here are all
the possible slugs for this route, and

66
00:03:43.218 --> 00:03:48.122
then we need to enable rich content
editing and rendering here on this page.

67
00:03:48.122 --> 00:03:49.812
So a couple of things we need to do.

68
00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:54.661
So let's get started with
the actual content model.

69
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:56.721
So for the content model, we need a post.

70
00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:00.829
Let's just go look at
the shape of this data.

71
00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.787
I think that's gonna be in,
let me see, customer, single post.

72
00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:07.006
It's in a single post page.

73
00:04:07.006 --> 00:04:09.740
So if you look in here,
there's a lot going on.

74
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.142
I don't think we're gonna
replace a lot of this.

75
00:04:12.142 --> 00:04:14.657
This is the stuff where it starts to
be complicated, but we'll replace them,

76
00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:16.193
the dynamic parts,
the parts that make sense.

77
00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:20.369
So won't touch the illustration,
won't touch any of this.

78
00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:21.260
So, here we go.

79
00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.613
We have a title.

80
00:04:22.613 --> 00:04:24.670
This is a title.

81
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.003
We have authors.

82
00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:27.085
We can make those.

83
00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:29.282
If we have time, we can make authors,
but this is an author.

84
00:04:29.282 --> 00:04:35.267
Author has a first name,
author has a name, and then a job.

85
00:04:35.267 --> 00:04:41.503
So, a job description, and then we have,
I guess, this is, what is this.

86
00:04:41.503 --> 00:04:47.359
I think this is that thing on the right.

87
00:04:47.359 --> 00:04:49.827
I know this is actually
part of the content.

88
00:04:49.827 --> 00:04:54.205
Okay, this is the content itself,
so gotcha.

89
00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:56.253
So this is where the content
starts with this paragraph.

90
00:04:56.253 --> 00:05:00.437
So as you can see, they're just using
regular HTML to do these things,

91
00:05:00.437 --> 00:05:03.506
which is great,
cuz I think that works perfectly for

92
00:05:03.506 --> 00:05:05.693
what we want to do as far as to render.

93
00:05:05.693 --> 00:05:07.880
If this was just one big div, and

94
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:13.388
then it used span tags everywhere to
style everything, that'd be really hard.

95
00:05:13.388 --> 00:05:16.696
But it's all just HTML
with no classes on it,

96
00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:19.842
cuz the classes I'm guessing are global.

97
00:05:19.842 --> 00:05:22.772
So that's great for us.

98
00:05:22.772 --> 00:05:23.517
So we need that.

99
00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:26.244
So that'll be the body
just related posting.

100
00:05:26.244 --> 00:05:27.225
We won't make that, but

101
00:05:27.225 --> 00:05:33.273
I think that's just,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: These things at the bottom,

102
00:05:33.273 --> 00:05:34.459
these are related.

103
00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:37.901
Cuz first, it's how do you
figure out they're related?

104
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:42.490
Do we figure that out or do we let content
person say these posts are related so

105
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.648
they can add them?

106
00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:45.209
I don't know.

107
00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:46.912
We also have this thing right here.

108
00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:48.475
&gt;&gt; Student 1: We won't get into that,
but-.

109
00:05:48.475 --> 00:05:51.332
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm all into a vector
store and do a semantic search.

110
00:05:51.332 --> 00:05:54.784
Yeah, just do a semantic search on
the related things, simple, easy.

111
00:05:54.784 --> 00:05:58.435
[LAUGH] Just throw AI at it.

112
00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:04.869
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so this page, if you
sit on it too long it starts to get janky.

113
00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:08.352
If you just do a hard refresh,
it doesn't get janky.

114
00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:12.133
I'm guessing has a memory leak somewhere
with some animations or something, so

115
00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:13.088
it just bothers me.

116
00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:16.623
All right, let's do that.

117
00:06:16.623 --> 00:06:19.042
We'll go to content model and
make a new one here.

118
00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:24.688
I'm gonna call this
a customer post like this.

119
00:06:27.485 --> 00:06:29.165
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm gonna add a field.

120
00:06:29.165 --> 00:06:35.344
I'm gonna say,
what is the title of the post?

121
00:06:35.344 --> 00:06:37.426
That's gonna be the entry title.

122
00:06:37.426 --> 00:06:40.975
That's gonna be required,
that's gonna be unique.

123
00:06:40.975 --> 00:06:43.630
And it's just gonna be that easy.

124
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:50.743
I'm gonna make another
one called the slug.

125
00:06:52.393 --> 00:06:53.580
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's gonna be short text.

126
00:06:55.323 --> 00:06:57.032
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It's
also gonna be required.

127
00:06:57.032 --> 00:07:02.438
It's also gonna be unique,
and it's gonna be a slug.

128
00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:05.462
This UI, when you pick slug is
not just changing the UI of it.

129
00:07:05.462 --> 00:07:08.855
It's a field that gets created
from another field, so

130
00:07:08.855 --> 00:07:11.667
the content person won't
fill out the slug.

131
00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:14.280
The slug gets generated
from some other field, and

132
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.270
we can tell the CMS what field
it should be generated from.

133
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.888
In this case, it's from the title.

134
00:07:20.888 --> 00:07:25.562
So whatever title you put in for
a customer post,

135
00:07:25.562 --> 00:07:28.870
that's what the slug is gonna be.

136
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.147
It's gonna be URL, it's gonna be formatted
in a way where it's safe for an URL.

137
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.139
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Slugified,
I guess that's the word I'm looking for.

138
00:07:40.139 --> 00:07:41.640
So we got that, we got a title.

139
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.820
We got that.

140
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.772
We have some more text here.

141
00:07:45.772 --> 00:07:46.822
So we have text here.

142
00:07:46.822 --> 00:07:52.300
This one's gonna be long
text full text search.

143
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.161
Wait, hold on, is that a rich text?

144
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:58.389
Yeah, sorry,
we want it to be rich text, not text.

145
00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:00.818
So we're gonna pick rich text instead.

146
00:08:00.818 --> 00:08:01.626
We will give this a name.

147
00:08:01.626 --> 00:08:03.572
I was gonna call this
the body of the post.

148
00:08:08.368 --> 00:08:12.110
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You can,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Turn on or

149
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:18.137
turn off any specific rich text
formatting options for the editor.

150
00:08:18.137 --> 00:08:20.459
If you want what's?

151
00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:21.289
It's kind of crazy.

152
00:08:21.289 --> 00:08:24.336
Well, I guess this makes sense because
it's like, if you're a developer and

153
00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:27.472
you're the one who needs to render this
content and you didn't write the logic to

154
00:08:27.472 --> 00:08:30.127
render some of these fields,
you need to turn them off until you do.

155
00:08:30.127 --> 00:08:32.338
So I guess that makes sense.

156
00:08:36.259 --> 00:08:38.683
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
I'm not linked to entry, linked to assets.

157
00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:43.282
Yeah, that's got a nice editting out, why,
we believe it, we're not gonna use it.

158
00:08:43.282 --> 00:08:43.996
That's pretty cool though.

159
00:08:43.996 --> 00:08:47.904
So this is also a required field.

160
00:08:50.605 --> 00:08:54.815
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And I don't think
we're gonna check any of these.

161
00:08:54.815 --> 00:08:56.173
Really any of that right now.

162
00:08:56.173 --> 00:08:58.286
So it's a bridge tax.

163
00:08:58.286 --> 00:09:00.894
We'll do that.

164
00:09:00.894 --> 00:09:05.385
And then the last thing we
wanna do is we wanna attach

165
00:09:05.385 --> 00:09:08.423
the actual customer to this post.

166
00:09:08.423 --> 00:09:10.733
So that means we need to make
another model for a customer.

167
00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:15.268
So I'm gonna hit save like this.

168
00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:16.663
I'll make a new content model.

169
00:09:20.209 --> 00:09:21.441
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Call it customer.

170
00:09:27.073 --> 00:09:28.816
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Add a field.

171
00:09:28.816 --> 00:09:29.624
Let's go have a text.

172
00:09:29.624 --> 00:09:32.010
It's gonna be what is the customer's name?

173
00:09:35.084 --> 00:09:36.348
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Represents the entry title.

174
00:09:36.348 --> 00:09:41.154
It is required, it is unique,
it's super simple.

175
00:09:41.154 --> 00:09:44.186
And then the customer has an image.

176
00:09:44.186 --> 00:09:46.931
So I'll just say logo.

177
00:09:46.931 --> 00:09:49.931
What is their logo.

178
00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:52.547
So do that, that's also required.

179
00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:02.610
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm gonna
say only an image type.

180
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.472
That's pretty cool.

181
00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:08.730
I'll give you new dimensions,
that's crazy.

182
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.209
Confirm that.

183
00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:11.840
Now we have that, let's save.

184
00:10:16.281 --> 00:10:19.358
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We'll go
back to the customer post.

185
00:10:19.358 --> 00:10:21.335
Add a new field for a customer.

186
00:10:21.335 --> 00:10:23.116
Which is a reference field.

187
00:10:27.868 --> 00:10:30.434
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
this is gonna be one reference.

188
00:10:30.434 --> 00:10:33.416
It's gonna be required.

189
00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:38.610
And it's only gonna be of type customer,
and it's gonna be one of those.

190
00:10:42.843 --> 00:10:47.964
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
I'm just gonna move it up to the top.

191
00:10:47.964 --> 00:10:49.232
I move it.

192
00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:50.735
No, it stayed out here, that's fine.

193
00:10:53.488 --> 00:10:56.263
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
so we got those things,

194
00:10:56.263 --> 00:10:58.954
now we can go make a customer post.

195
00:10:58.954 --> 00:11:01.178
I'm just gonna copy the one that's there
and then we will be able to edit it.

196
00:11:01.178 --> 00:11:05.802
So I add an entry, add a customer post.

197
00:11:05.802 --> 00:11:08.305
It's gonna take the one
that was already there.

198
00:11:10.489 --> 00:11:11.694
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This right here.

199
00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:18.604
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Put that there, and

200
00:11:18.604 --> 00:11:23.334
then you can see the slug got generated,
got slugified.

201
00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:26.129
I didn't have to do that,
it just happened.

202
00:11:29.409 --> 00:11:33.951
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And for the body, I think I
should be able to paste that, copy it from

203
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:39.802
the website, not the actual code, but from
the website when it's already rendered.

204
00:11:39.802 --> 00:11:43.457
Put it in here and
it'll keep the formatting.

205
00:11:43.457 --> 00:11:45.658
Okay, pretty sure.

206
00:11:45.658 --> 00:11:53.186
So if I copy this and put that in here,
yeah, it for sure, keeps the formatting.

207
00:11:53.186 --> 00:11:58.917
So we got that, and then the last
thing we need is the actual customer.

208
00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:02.140
We don't have a customer, so
we're gonna make a new one.

209
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.381
This customer is going to be called,
who do I have in my,

210
00:12:07.381 --> 00:12:11.183
there lemme see what customers we have.

211
00:12:11.183 --> 00:12:13.345
We have, I guess we look at the website.

212
00:12:18.972 --> 00:12:25.808
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We got Airbnb, Facebook,
let's just say this one is Canon.

213
00:12:25.808 --> 00:12:27.319
We'll just say Canon.

214
00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:31.276
So this customer is Canon.

215
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.129
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Add existing media cuz
I already have these things uploaded.

216
00:12:38.129 --> 00:12:39.736
So I'm gonna pick that one.

217
00:12:39.736 --> 00:12:41.633
And there we go, publish that.

218
00:12:46.385 --> 00:12:51.162
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Go back here,
everything looks good.

219
00:12:51.162 --> 00:12:52.901
Publish that.

220
00:12:54.249 --> 00:12:58.364
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
now we have a post, a customer post,

221
00:12:58.364 --> 00:13:01.938
I guess I should change this to Canon.

222
00:13:01.938 --> 00:13:03.381
So it makes more sense.

223
00:13:07.106 --> 00:13:08.947
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Like,
not to change if it's generated.

224
00:13:08.947 --> 00:13:09.882
Why didn't that change?

225
00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:13.400
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Pull this out again.

226
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.424
Okay, so now we got that.

227
00:13:15.424 --> 00:13:19.630
Like always,
I'm gonna go query this in Apollo, and

228
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:25.143
then we're gonna figure out how to
generate the pages ahead of time and

229
00:13:25.143 --> 00:13:29.645
then also dynamically render
something based on a slug.

230
00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:31.846
So let's go do that.

231
00:13:31.846 --> 00:13:37.818
So first things first is go to Apollo.

232
00:13:37.818 --> 00:13:38.844
Kind of go back.

233
00:13:42.596 --> 00:13:45.134
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go now,
I'm going to look for,

234
00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.834
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: A customer post collection.

235
00:13:50.834 --> 00:13:56.030
So I want to be able to get,
this is for when we're on the customer

236
00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.479
slash slug ID, so this would be for
one customer post.

237
00:14:00.479 --> 00:14:04.498
It won't be for
the list where it shows them all,

238
00:14:04.498 --> 00:14:09.903
cuz I don't think the site even has
a view where it shows them all.

239
00:14:09.903 --> 00:14:14.903
It really is just,
you get a list of customers like this and

240
00:14:14.903 --> 00:14:20.734
then if they have a post,
you can click on it, it'll take you to it.

241
00:14:20.734 --> 00:14:24.888
So we won't worry about this part right
now since this is more the same what we've

242
00:14:24.888 --> 00:14:29.123
done before, but what we will focus on is
this part because it's a dynamic route.

243
00:14:29.123 --> 00:14:31.537
Right now it's a hardcoded
route that says single post.

244
00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:32.324
We're not gonna use that.

245
00:14:32.324 --> 00:14:33.912
We're gonna use a dynamic route.

246
00:14:41.153 --> 00:14:45.548
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
in that case I want to be able to get one

247
00:14:45.548 --> 00:14:48.360
customer post by a slug.

248
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.659
That's what I wanna be able to do.

249
00:14:49.659 --> 00:14:51.488
So let's do that.

250
00:14:51.488 --> 00:14:56.240
So I'll say, go back to Apollo.

251
00:14:56.240 --> 00:15:01.665
I wanna be able to get
a customer post collection,

252
00:15:01.665 --> 00:15:06.342
where,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Slug and

253
00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:11.607
then you have to put in the value
of the slug that you want,

254
00:15:11.607 --> 00:15:14.142
I'll get ours in a minute.

255
00:15:14.142 --> 00:15:18.550
Then I want to get the items,

256
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.053
the title, the slug.

257
00:15:22.053 --> 00:15:29.389
To get the customer from the customer,
I wanna get the logo which has a URL,

258
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:33.831
width, height, title, all those things.

259
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:39.554
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I also wanna
get the name of the customer.

260
00:15:42.328 --> 00:15:44.724
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
I think I'm gonna get the body.

261
00:15:44.724 --> 00:15:45.237
There we go.

262
00:15:45.237 --> 00:15:48.570
And the bodies JSON format.

263
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.637
That's how the rich text
editor output stuff,

264
00:15:51.637 --> 00:15:54.790
which makes it easy to be
parsed on any platform.

265
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.896
So if you needed to take this rich
text output and render it on iOS,

266
00:15:58.896 --> 00:16:02.629
you can do that either rendered
on the web If you can do that,

267
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:05.168
anything can take JSON and render it so,

268
00:16:05.168 --> 00:16:10.502
that's why it's not specific to something
like the web where it would output HTML.

269
00:16:10.502 --> 00:16:13.134
So we got that if we run this,
we didn't get any things,

270
00:16:13.134 --> 00:16:16.102
I actually had to pull a slug in here,
so let's go get our slug.

271
00:16:17.836 --> 00:16:26.077
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This one,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So

272
00:16:26.077 --> 00:16:30.985
I'll add the slug,
run this again, and there we go.

273
00:16:30.985 --> 00:16:32.653
All this is mostly the body.

274
00:16:32.653 --> 00:16:34.590
The body is just JSON, so
you see a lot of that.

275
00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.590
They put the body at the top,
so let me collapse it.

276
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:38.159
There we go.

277
00:16:38.159 --> 00:16:41.554
So you see, here's the title,
there's the slug, there's the customer,

278
00:16:41.554 --> 00:16:44.338
the name of the logo, logo's got a URL,
the width and height.

279
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.249
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, let's copy this.

280
00:16:56.249 --> 00:17:00.292
We'll put this in our queries.

281
00:17:02.611 --> 00:17:11.208
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We'll say,
export const getContentForCustomer post.

282
00:17:15.115 --> 00:17:16.369
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Make our query.

283
00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.486
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And paste this in.

284
00:17:26.486 --> 00:17:29.885
There we go, boom, boom.

285
00:17:29.885 --> 00:17:34.833
All right, we got that,
and then like always,

286
00:17:34.833 --> 00:17:37.563
it's just data = await.

287
00:17:37.563 --> 00:17:42.227
ContentGqFetcher, where we pass
in our query, in this case,

288
00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:45.750
we do have variables,
we have aware variable.

289
00:17:50.826 --> 00:17:54.425
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
aware is like, what is it?

290
00:17:54.425 --> 00:17:59.262
Its name, I forgot what it was,
let's go look.

291
00:17:59.262 --> 00:18:01.196
Slug, yeah, yeah, sorry.

292
00:18:03.057 --> 00:18:07.322
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So slug, so that means this
needs to take in an argument for slug,

293
00:18:07.322 --> 00:18:08.416
slug is string.

294
00:18:10.627 --> 00:18:12.906
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we got slug here.

295
00:18:12.906 --> 00:18:21.618
Got our data, if not data,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Throw a new error.

296
00:18:23.695 --> 00:18:25.029
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Turn data.

297
00:18:35.098 --> 00:18:40.233
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,
let's go to types, copy this.

298
00:18:40.233 --> 00:18:47.987
Go to our types,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Explorer type,

299
00:18:47.987 --> 00:18:53.657
customer post, query, paste that in.

300
00:18:53.657 --> 00:18:57.535
That's an object type.

301
00:18:57.535 --> 00:19:03.444
This returns an an array of objects,
so put an array down there.

302
00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:08.150
This is a string, customers and objects,

303
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:12.830
logos and objects, these are strings.

304
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.594
This is a string, so to our numbers.

305
00:19:18.585 --> 00:19:20.757
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This is a string, and

306
00:19:20.757 --> 00:19:25.965
this is an object with
the type of JSON that is JSON.

307
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:40.074
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so
we have our type, everything looks good.

308
00:19:40.074 --> 00:19:47.174
Now, all we need to do is
go use this in our file.

309
00:19:47.174 --> 00:19:50.679
So the file for
this is gonna be inside of customers.

310
00:19:50.679 --> 00:19:56.279
So right now, we don't have a dynamic
route for this, so we need to make one.

311
00:19:56.279 --> 00:20:00.180
So what we'll do inside the customers
folder, we'll make a new folder.

312
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.916
And we'll say, [slug], like that And

313
00:20:03.916 --> 00:20:08.842
inside of that,
we'll make a file called page.tsx.

314
00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.213
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
this is gonna be our page.

315
00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:19.653
So, all I'm gonna do is just take
whatever's in a single-post page and

316
00:20:19.653 --> 00:20:20.912
bring it there.

317
00:20:20.912 --> 00:20:22.368
I could just move that file.

318
00:20:22.368 --> 00:20:25.509
I could just move that file up there,
but I'm just gonna paste it in.

319
00:20:25.509 --> 00:20:28.499
It's the same file.

320
00:20:31.849 --> 00:20:33.462
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'll bring
in the related post.

321
00:20:33.462 --> 00:20:36.153
It wants to relate a post,
so I'll bring it in.

322
00:20:36.153 --> 00:20:39.980
I was getting rid of
this single-post folder,
