00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.655
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We are now gonna move into
something a little more advanced, but

2
00:00:03.655 --> 00:00:05.013
definitely necessary.

3
00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:08.291
And pretty much,
every head of CMS has this feature, but

4
00:00:08.291 --> 00:00:10.969
how they implement it is always so
different.

5
00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.928
The CMS that we're using, Contenful,

6
00:00:12.928 --> 00:00:17.087
has a couple ways to implement what we're
gonna work on, which is gonna be previews.

7
00:00:17.087 --> 00:00:19.121
And we're gonna choose one of those ways.

8
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:21.236
Other ways is just a lot more complicated,
and

9
00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:23.469
I don't really have a lot
of experience with it.

10
00:00:23.469 --> 00:00:26.590
So I'm not even gonna bother touching it,
but we'll address it and

11
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.646
we'll talk about it.

12
00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:32.152
And then I'll kinda walk through
how other CMSs handle previous,

13
00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:35.719
cuz it's all very quite interesting.

14
00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.684
It's been a lot of time in this space on
this feature when [LAUGH] I was working on

15
00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:43.970
the CMS, so it's one of those things that
it really does make or break it, I think.

16
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:51.023
In order to do previews, I gotta walk you
through what it means to have a preview,

17
00:00:51.023 --> 00:00:55.382
and what is it that you're
actually previewing,

18
00:00:55.382 --> 00:01:01.031
right, and why,
more specifically, the workflow.

19
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:08.185
So previews are a concept where, imagine
scenario where you have some content.

20
00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:12.787
You're working on, let's go to one
of our pieces of content here,

21
00:01:12.787 --> 00:01:14.821
let's say this post here.

22
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.907
Okay, I'm working on this post,
I don't know,

23
00:01:17.907 --> 00:01:20.996
I'm not really ready to hit Publish yet,
right?

24
00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.794
But I wanna see what it
looks like on the website.

25
00:01:23.794 --> 00:01:26.507
But so far, we've always had to hit
Publish to see what it looks like

26
00:01:26.507 --> 00:01:27.814
on a website.

27
00:01:27.814 --> 00:01:32.119
If I hit Publish, well, it's gonna show
up on the production website because

28
00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.857
everything that's published shows
up on the production website.

29
00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:40.636
And I don't want draft content
showing up on the production website.

30
00:01:40.636 --> 00:01:45.124
Who knows what the engineers have hooked
up to webhooks when it comes to that

31
00:01:45.124 --> 00:01:46.986
Publish button being pushed?

32
00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:50.100
In the case of,
if you're building websites with Gatsby,

33
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.806
this would trigger a rebuild with Gatsby.

34
00:01:52.806 --> 00:01:56.816
This is a very common thing you did with
Gatsby, is a trigger rebuilds whenever

35
00:01:56.816 --> 00:02:00.061
a CMS changed or something like that,
a CMS document changed.

36
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:04.872
In the case of Next.js, triggering
this could invalidate a tag that will

37
00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:07.290
bring in some more content, right?

38
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.440
Or just adding it,
if you have a server function,

39
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.891
we'll then just show it in
that list of all your posts.

40
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:16.737
So you don't want that
to show if it's draft.

41
00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:22.095
That could be really bad, but how do you
see it on the website in the meantime?

42
00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:25.879
That's what a preview's for, the preview
allows you to see draft content.

43
00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.918
And when I say you,
I mean specifically you,

44
00:02:27.918 --> 00:02:31.335
the person who's looking at the preview,
and no one else, to see that.

45
00:02:31.335 --> 00:02:33.442
How do they do it?

46
00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:34.823
It's actually quite simple.

47
00:02:34.823 --> 00:02:39.546
So the way it works is you give your

48
00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:43.966
CMS a URL in which it can hit.

49
00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:49.392
Typically, this URL is gonna be a route
handler, it's not gonna be a actual page.

50
00:02:49.392 --> 00:02:51.626
It's not gonna be a front-end page,
it's not gonna be a route handler.

51
00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:56.413
You can put whatever you want on that
query string when you give it to your CMS.

52
00:02:56.413 --> 00:02:58.767
You can put a secret, and
you should put a secret there.

53
00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:01.136
That way, you can can confirm
that it came from your CMS, and

54
00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:04.528
it's not someone else trying to
see some of your draft content.

55
00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:09.143
And then inside your route handler,
what you do is you confirm the secret,

56
00:03:09.143 --> 00:03:10.543
you do all that stuff.

57
00:03:10.543 --> 00:03:15.304
And then, depending on what the URL is and
your strategy for resolving previews,

58
00:03:15.304 --> 00:03:17.719
it could be like,
I have a preview link for

59
00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:20.691
every single type of entity
that can be previewed.

60
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:23.444
Or I have one preview link for everything,

61
00:03:23.444 --> 00:03:26.588
it really just depends on
what your strategy is.

62
00:03:26.588 --> 00:03:31.779
You're going to redirect that request to
your website, or whatever the content

63
00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:36.526
that the person is trying to preview
is gonna be rendered on your website.

64
00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:38.820
You're gonna redirect to that.

65
00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:43.692
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And there's a couple
of things you do before that.

66
00:03:43.692 --> 00:03:48.079
In Next.js, you have to enable
something called draft mode,

67
00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.987
which basically, it just makes sure
that the caching isn't strong.

68
00:03:52.987 --> 00:03:58.056
It just makes sure that when you
enable that, you're not gonna be

69
00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:03.782
opted into the caching that would have
prevented some change being seen.

70
00:04:03.782 --> 00:04:06.652
That's basically what draft mode does,
it just sets a cookie.

71
00:04:06.652 --> 00:04:11.437
And then also, once that cookie
is set on the server components,

72
00:04:11.437 --> 00:04:14.486
you can check to see
if that cookie is set.

73
00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:18.078
If you're in draft mode,
we can pass that to our query like, hey,

74
00:04:18.078 --> 00:04:22.074
we're in draft mode, so pass the preview
argument to all of our queries.

75
00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:26.714
So when Contentful returns, when we do
a query to Contentful, we're passing

76
00:04:26.714 --> 00:04:31.376
a preview true, so it knows to get
preview content, and that's how it flows.

77
00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.053
And then you can clear that
cookie whenever you're done.

78
00:04:33.053 --> 00:04:37.418
A lot of people put a button on the page
that'll show cool, exit preview, and

79
00:04:37.418 --> 00:04:42.139
all that does, it just clears the cookie
and then redirects you to the other thing.

80
00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.473
So that was a lot, we're gonna do
everything I just said, but I wanted to

81
00:04:45.473 --> 00:04:49.100
walk you through that because it sounds
more complicated than it actually is.

82
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.178
And they even have a guide here
that walks you through it.

83
00:04:53.178 --> 00:05:00.718
So what we're gonna do is we're
gonna set up a preview for our hero.

84
00:05:00.718 --> 00:05:05.558
So our hero is gonna be,
just click on hero, this one.

85
00:05:07.622 --> 00:05:11.100
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So to do that,
we're going to Set up a custom preview.

86
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.902
So if you click Set up a custom preview
here on the hero side, you could do that.

87
00:05:15.902 --> 00:05:20.462
You could also click on settings and
go to Content preview, same thing,

88
00:05:20.462 --> 00:05:21.826
it's the same page.

89
00:05:21.826 --> 00:05:24.546
Click that, and then for the name,

90
00:05:24.546 --> 00:05:30.492
typically the name you put here is
the thing that you are previewing.

91
00:05:30.492 --> 00:05:37.724
So in this case, I'll put Hero Preview.

92
00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:40.350
You can put a description if you want.

93
00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:47.733
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then for the preview
URL, so activate the content preview and

94
00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:51.506
specify a custom URL for
every content type that should display.

95
00:05:51.506 --> 00:05:56.658
So you can pick one of these content
types, we're gonna say Hero,

96
00:05:56.658 --> 00:06:00.067
and then we can put the preview URL for
that.

97
00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:05.808
So in this case,
it's not a webhook, right?

98
00:06:05.808 --> 00:06:09.937
What it's gonna do, it's really just
gonna redirect your browser to that.

99
00:06:09.937 --> 00:06:14.292
So it can be localhost, it doesn't have to
be something on a tunnel, like in Grok or

100
00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:17.188
something like that,
cuz it's not making a call.

101
00:06:17.188 --> 00:06:20.667
It's just gonna open up a tab and go here.

102
00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:24.091
So it can be localhost, so
we're gonna put localhost.

103
00:06:24.091 --> 00:06:26.525
In my case, I'm on 3,000.

104
00:06:26.525 --> 00:06:30.665
We're gonna make a route, so
API route, so it'll be /api, and

105
00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:32.410
then I'll just say draft.

106
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.889
You can call it whatever you want,
I'm calling it draft.

107
00:06:37.387 --> 00:06:38.142
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right, and

108
00:06:38.142 --> 00:06:41.115
then you can also use these
interpolated values in your URL.

109
00:06:41.115 --> 00:06:46.890
So if it has a slug or any field,
you can get the field and put it in here.

110
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:54.304
So if I wanted to do something like,
I think heroes have titles, right?

111
00:06:54.304 --> 00:06:58.481
So I could do something like title and

112
00:06:58.481 --> 00:07:05.637
then I could do entry.fields.title,
something like that.

113
00:07:05.637 --> 00:07:08.574
And I'll put the title there,
so I can do things like that.

114
00:07:08.574 --> 00:07:13.358
If you want to get crazy,
there's a lot of stuff you can do,

115
00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:16.343
but I'm not gonna worry about that.

116
00:07:16.343 --> 00:07:18.197
Okay, so we got that, I'm gonna hit Save.

117
00:07:20.057 --> 00:07:21.602
Now we got a Hero Preview.

118
00:07:26.824 --> 00:07:29.974
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This part's important
actually, so preview mode.

119
00:07:29.974 --> 00:07:33.672
They have something called Live preview,
which they recommend,

120
00:07:33.672 --> 00:07:35.263
we won't be doing this one.

121
00:07:35.263 --> 00:07:38.127
[LAUGH] And they have this other
one called Preview in new tab,

122
00:07:38.127 --> 00:07:39.372
we'll be doing this one.

123
00:07:39.372 --> 00:07:41.716
Live preview is cool, we can check it out.

124
00:07:41.716 --> 00:07:44.190
You can kinda see what it attempts to do.

125
00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.254
The preview won't work.

126
00:07:45.254 --> 00:07:51.071
There's just some code we have to do on
our side inside the app to enable this,

127
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:57.366
and getting that to work right now with
Next.js app directory, it's not hard.

128
00:07:57.366 --> 00:08:00.042
You need to know a little
more about Next.js app.

129
00:08:00.042 --> 00:08:02.936
I feel like it's too specific to that,
so I didn't wanna cover it.

130
00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:06.728
It's way too specific to Next.js as
an app directory just to get around it.

131
00:08:06.728 --> 00:08:10.511
But there's some things you have to
install, because basically what this is

132
00:08:10.511 --> 00:08:13.200
gonna do, it's going to pull
your site up in a iframe.

133
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.890
When your site loads up in an iframe,

134
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.242
there's a bunch of security
issues around there.

135
00:08:17.242 --> 00:08:20.439
So you gotta do some stuff with
the headers, you gotta enable some things.

136
00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.820
You gotta install something
else on your side,

137
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.164
because the way iframe communication works
with its parent window is using, there's

138
00:08:27.164 --> 00:08:31.050
a messaging API which they can communicate
back and forth if you enable that.

139
00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.357
By default,
you get that on the same domain, but

140
00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:37.347
when you're not on the same domain,
you have to enable that experience.

141
00:08:37.347 --> 00:08:41.315
But if you do have that, it lets you
do this type of visual live editing.

142
00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:45.058
So you can't actually edit on the website,
but you'll have a form next to you that

143
00:08:45.058 --> 00:08:48.813
when you fill it out, you'll see it change
directly on the website immediately.

144
00:08:48.813 --> 00:08:52.716
So you'll see things like
that that are really cool.

145
00:08:52.716 --> 00:08:56.965
To be honest, it's cool, but
CMS has been doing that for a long time,

146
00:08:56.965 --> 00:08:59.429
the newer CMS's are just way past that.

147
00:08:59.429 --> 00:09:01.968
So it's great, but
it's like, yeah, whatever.

148
00:09:01.968 --> 00:09:02.715
We're gonna do this one.

149
00:09:02.715 --> 00:09:06.832
It just opens up a new tab which we don't
have to do anything on our side other than

150
00:09:06.832 --> 00:09:09.261
make the route, so we'll do that one.

151
00:09:09.261 --> 00:09:13.119
And it'll still be pretty valuable, so
make sure you click that Preview new tab.

152
00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.031
And actually, no, let's click this.

153
00:09:15.031 --> 00:09:18.857
I want you to see what it looks like,
so we'll do that.

154
00:09:18.857 --> 00:09:23.140
I don't know who designed this UX, but
once you get here, you're in a dead end.

155
00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.117
You can't go anywhere until
you click somewhere else.

156
00:09:25.117 --> 00:09:29.934
There's not a back button or
anything, you're just dead.

157
00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:34.908
I can't stand dead ends on apps, but
anyway, let's go back to Content,

158
00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:35.960
go right here.

159
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.460
And now you should see Open Live Preview,
this should be enabled now.

160
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:45.127
So when I click it,
it's going to attempt to, well,

161
00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:49.106
it should load up the website at least,
let's see.

162
00:09:49.106 --> 00:09:54.550
Well, yeah, we don't have that route,
it doesn't have the /api/draft route,

163
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:57.629
so it's just 404, but
this is what it does.

164
00:09:57.629 --> 00:10:00.380
It'll attempt to load it up, and then
you can edit some stuff on the left and

165
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.186
you'll see it change on the right,
which is great, that's what you want.

166
00:10:03.186 --> 00:10:05.731
But again, iframes, things like that.

167
00:10:06.871 --> 00:10:11.191
We're just gonna do old school, so I'm
gonna go back and I'm gonna change this.

168
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:15.751
Click on my Content preview, change
this back to Preview in a tab, hit Save.

169
00:10:15.751 --> 00:10:22.091
And then now when I go back here,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It'll say Open Preview and

170
00:10:22.091 --> 00:10:23.117
it'll just open a preview tab.

171
00:10:23.117 --> 00:10:26.388
Still 404 because we don't have that URL,
but you get the point.
