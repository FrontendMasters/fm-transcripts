1
00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.494
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool,
any questions on that?

2
00:00:05.978 --> 00:00:09.758
&gt;&gt; Student 1: I'm not sure if I missed
this, but to see you have more than one

3
00:00:09.758 --> 00:00:14.998
content person wanting to see a preview,
how would you delineate changes if there's

4
00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:19.826
maybe potential for working on a similar
piece, maybe the same piece of data?

5
00:00:19.826 --> 00:00:22.998
Is that possible with Contentful,
for example?

6
00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:28.063
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Every database
handles multi-tenancy differently,

7
00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:33.352
so I have no idea how Contentful
handles multi-tenancy.

8
00:00:33.352 --> 00:00:37.942
If they're more like a Google Docs type
thing, if we both open up the same doc,

9
00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:42.413
we're both editing the same doc and
we see each other's edits in real time.

10
00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:46.094
If they do something like locking where
if someone is writing to the database,

11
00:00:46.094 --> 00:00:49.018
it locks and no one else can write
until the operation is done.

12
00:00:49.018 --> 00:00:51.627
And then you would just have to know,

13
00:00:51.627 --> 00:00:57.210
like you gotta hit refresh to see like,
somebody just did something.

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.119
I have no idea how they would do it, but

15
00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:02.546
the really good ones will do something
very similar to Google Docs.

16
00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:06.837
You'll see someone's avatar pop up, you'll
see that they're working on this doc,

17
00:01:06.837 --> 00:01:08.206
at least you'll see that.

18
00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.271
You might not be able to see each
other's edits and things like that, but

19
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.846
you'll be able to see that at
least someone is working on it.

20
00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.138
And then if they make changes,

21
00:01:15.138 --> 00:01:18.276
those changes they get pushed to
your editor while you're on it.

22
00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:21.756
So I might be working here and then
a little bubble will come up, so and so

23
00:01:21.756 --> 00:01:24.716
just make changes click here
to get the latest ones, right?

24
00:01:24.716 --> 00:01:30.226
So it'll get the latest ones but
without discarding my changes, right?

25
00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:34.983
So that's something, but I would say
the trend that I've been seeing is just be

26
00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:37.337
like Figma, just be like Google Docs.

27
00:01:37.337 --> 00:01:40.458
This is a plain document, if you're
getting here, we're working together.

28
00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:42.998
And in that way it's totally fine
if we're doing it at the same time.

29
00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:45.767
If we're doing it separately,
then it doesn't matter.

30
00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:47.624
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Gotcha.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

31
00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:48.738
&gt;&gt; Student 1: That makes sense.

32
00:01:48.738 --> 00:01:52.372
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, I mean,
with companies like Liveblocks,

33
00:01:52.372 --> 00:01:58.083
it's super easy to just add real-time
collaboration to any app without any,

34
00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:02.602
CRDT or any of that stuff on the back end,
it's super simple.

35
00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:05.562
So I don't know why
people just wouldn't add.

36
00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:09.328
If I'm an app that has some type
of editing experience for Teams,

37
00:02:09.328 --> 00:02:11.432
I'm adding real-time.

38
00:02:11.432 --> 00:02:15.473
Guaranteed, there's just no way
I'm not doing it, it's 2024.

39
00:02:18.312 --> 00:02:19.302
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Any other questions?

40
00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:21.387
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Do yo know of any CMS

41
00:02:21.387 --> 00:02:28.812
platforms that integrate directly with
like Vercel's draft capabilities?

42
00:02:29.842 --> 00:02:30.512
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.

43
00:02:30.512 --> 00:02:34.242
&gt;&gt; Student 2: Would you have to manually
implement that too, right back?

44
00:02:34.242 --> 00:02:35.462
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's a great question.

45
00:02:35.462 --> 00:02:42.709
So that's something that I wanted to,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Figure out and

46
00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.837
connect and make all that work,
but they do have they do

47
00:02:47.837 --> 00:02:53.639
have the SDKs that allow you to
make those changes yourself.

48
00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.767
The problem is like you really
got to be bought in on that,

49
00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:02.324
[LAUGH] It's tough because
there's just too much crossover.

50
00:03:02.324 --> 00:03:07.056
What Vercel is doing, it's great,
if your team heavily uses

51
00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:12.714
pre-Vercell previews on deploy, and
you guys use that for everything.

52
00:03:12.714 --> 00:03:16.437
Like, hey, send me the preview link and
I'll check it out,

53
00:03:16.437 --> 00:03:21.552
I'll review your code, I'll draw on it,
I'll do markup, I'll circle things.

54
00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:25.125
Then yeah, it's probably worth you like
adding the integration in which when you

55
00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:27.946
click this button on Vercel's thing,
it makes a post request.

56
00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:31.131
Because Ccntemplate,
we've just been doing the read API,

57
00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:32.696
they have a write API as well.

58
00:03:32.696 --> 00:03:36.696
So you can back and
do things like that as well.

59
00:03:36.696 --> 00:03:43.488
And you can see they have
the integrations right here as well.

60
00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:48.769
It's just an MIP and it's just okay
well builder also has that and

61
00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.468
so does dado and so does payload.

62
00:03:51.468 --> 00:03:53.758
They all have their own visual thing.

63
00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:58.464
So that crossover is what gets confusing
because if you're a content person

64
00:03:58.464 --> 00:04:02.727
you're like okay, so do I go to this
preview and that's when I do it or

65
00:04:02.727 --> 00:04:05.798
do I go to Builder and
that's when I do it?

66
00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:09.795
So it's not that you can't do it,
it's just like should you do it?

67
00:04:09.795 --> 00:04:10.535
Not sure.

68
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:15.248
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, yes.

69
00:04:15.248 --> 00:04:18.839
&gt;&gt; Student 3: Can you do AB
testing seen with the CMS.

70
00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:23.030
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Of course,
you do AV testing with CMS, but

71
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.669
it's not as sophisticated as, like
a real AB testing solution cuz it's not.

72
00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.289
It's like not keeping track.

73
00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.074
It's not keeping track of things, AB
testing with the CMS is it's not a place

74
00:04:34.074 --> 00:04:38.026
where you would like, you're not
gonna create a AB test framework.

75
00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:42.117
If you have a AB test going,
you can integrate different

76
00:04:42.117 --> 00:04:46.906
variations of content in an AB
test that you already have.

77
00:04:46.906 --> 00:04:51.279
And that's as simple as just adding a
field to some variation of something that

78
00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.271
says what experiment this is,
maybe what bucket ID.

79
00:04:54.271 --> 00:04:57.613
Whatever you're shading on,
you just add a field for

80
00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:00.222
that and send that along with your query.

81
00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:04.126
So like if we had a query,
let's go to our queries here.

82
00:05:06.852 --> 00:05:11.025
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If we had a query here for
a hero and a hero had a field on it called

83
00:05:11.025 --> 00:05:15.680
bucket, then we would get that bucket
from a cookie from an AB test and

84
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.255
we'd pass it in here and then we just
pass the bucket along as well and

85
00:05:20.255 --> 00:05:23.462
we'll get that different variation.

86
00:05:23.462 --> 00:05:29.812
So yeah, you could totally do it,
is it useful though?

87
00:05:29.812 --> 00:05:33.132
I don't know because a lot of those AB
testing frameworks already do this.

88
00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:36.372
They already have the ability
to let you change things.

89
00:05:36.372 --> 00:05:38.402
Like some of the best AB testing
frameworks are the ones that

90
00:05:38.402 --> 00:05:39.059
sit on the edge.

91
00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:42.719
And if it's sitting on the edge,
it has the ability to rewrite HTML.

92
00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.373
So if you can rewrite HTML on the edge,

93
00:05:44.373 --> 00:05:46.509
do you need to do this from
your CMS at that point?

94
00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:52.741
I don't know, so all these apps are doing
the same thing at this point, so

95
00:05:52.741 --> 00:05:54.489
it's really difficult.

96
00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:59.903
And there are a lot of helicity and
mess that leaned in heavily to AB testing.

97
00:05:59.903 --> 00:06:03.060
And I've seen it like pull
back because it's like you,

98
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.438
if you can't solve all of AB testing,
then you shouldn't be doing any of it.

99
00:06:07.438 --> 00:06:12.196
You should just let people make variations
and make the API calls, but stop trying to

100
00:06:12.196 --> 00:06:16.788
make the AB test yourself, because
there's a lot that goes into AB testing.

101
00:06:16.788 --> 00:06:18.023
When I was working at Netflix,

102
00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:20.778
the AB testing framework that they
built there was like one of the most

103
00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:23.940
sophisticated piece of software
I've ever seen in my life.

104
00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:28.080
So it's not it's not something a headless
CMS wants to build from scratch.

105
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.860
But yeah,
you make a field you start on that.

106
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.990
There you go, there's your variation.

107
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:37.270
It probably depends on the context of
the AB test if it's button colors for

108
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.145
a different.

109
00:06:38.145 --> 00:06:42.245
Then show this feature versus
some new version of the feature.

110
00:06:42.245 --> 00:06:46.195
Exactly, yep, and yeah you can get down
to whatever granular level you want.

111
00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:50.357
So far we've only been talking
about assets and content, but

112
00:06:50.357 --> 00:06:55.800
what's stopping you from saying, let's
go to an example here where we're on,

113
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.101
on the call to actions in the,
on a hero, right?

114
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:06.625
So here I am, if I go to the call
to actions on a hero, this one.

115
00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:10.311
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so this one has like
these class names, these are just strings,

116
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.811
I can add these in the CMS.

117
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:14.852
I'm like, all right,
not only can you do this, but

118
00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:19.086
you can change the color of this gradient,
you can do whatever you want.

119
00:07:19.086 --> 00:07:23.275
I can put all this in a CMS if I want
it to and allow anyone to change this.

120
00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:27.177
And then yes, you can hook that up to an
AV test as a variation, which is a button

121
00:07:27.177 --> 00:07:30.556
color, plus some different texts,
different things like that.

122
00:07:30.556 --> 00:07:34.636
So the question is, again,
should you, is that a good idea?

123
00:07:35.776 --> 00:07:38.201
Depends on your team and my experience?

124
00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:42.992
No, [LAUGH] In my experience,
the problem that I found out is that

125
00:07:42.992 --> 00:07:48.079
most non technical people don't
think of data in a structured way.

126
00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:51.618
They think of data in a non-structured
way, it's like a blog post,

127
00:07:51.618 --> 00:07:53.139
it's just text.

128
00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:56.321
They don't think of it as like,
this object with this field and

129
00:07:56.321 --> 00:08:01.170
there's a title and a subtitle, but ahead
of the CMS is mostly for structured data.

130
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:05.135
So trying to get people who
think of paragraphs to now

131
00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:08.870
think of objects is like very difficult.

132
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.010
So that's usually the breaker right there.

133
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:16.639
So anchor modal server rendering is
basically what I've been discussing

134
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:21.880
Discussing earlier where I was like, you
don't have to like load up all the pages.

135
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.490
You can just kind of get
some more later on the fly.

136
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.770
That's really easy to do
in the pages directory.

137
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:32.608
In the app directory, I'm pretty
sure that's like in beta right now,

138
00:08:32.608 --> 00:08:37.391
or maybe even alpha,
I don't think that's even out.

139
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:41.709
So I don't think you can do
the incremental stuff in the app directory

140
00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:42.461
right now.

141
00:08:42.461 --> 00:08:47.731
You could definitely do that in
the pages directory right here at ISR.

142
00:08:47.731 --> 00:08:49.331
Very simple, it's very powerful.

143
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:53.890
So if you need that,
maybe don't use app directory right now,

144
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.629
but you can also do it yourself
to be honest with app directory.

145
00:08:58.629 --> 00:09:02.735
You can just, you know, render
the first in amount that you want, and

146
00:09:02.735 --> 00:09:06.089
then render the rest on demand
when someone clicks on it.

147
00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:09.629
So it's not, out of the question to do it,
do it yourself, just,

148
00:09:09.629 --> 00:09:12.319
given the nature of how
server components work.

149
00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:14.269
So it's not too crazy.
