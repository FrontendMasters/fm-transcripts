1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.665
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, let's enable this.

2
00:00:01.665 --> 00:00:05.485
So let's go to our code,
we're gonna make API route.

3
00:00:05.485 --> 00:00:10.911
So API, you can get rid of this hello one,
doesn't do anything,

4
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:14.869
make a new folder and
app/api, called draft.

5
00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.572
Make a file in there called route.ts.

6
00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:23.385
And what we wanna do, actually,
I forgot we need to add our secret.

7
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:26.947
So let's go back to our settings,
our content preview.

8
00:00:26.947 --> 00:00:28.485
Let's click on the one that we made.

9
00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.094
We need to put our secret here,
so I'm gonna put a query string.

10
00:00:31.094 --> 00:00:34.351
I'm gonna say, I don't know, secret, and

11
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:39.684
set that equal to whatever your secret
was in your environment variable.

12
00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:45.231
So I'm gonna grab mine, and this is use
defined, you can put whatever you want.

13
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:50.404
I'm just gonna put this, so there we go,
this way we know it came from contentful.

14
00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:52.395
So we got that.

15
00:00:56.834 --> 00:01:01.064
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And basically the strategy
is, I'll walk you through it,

16
00:01:01.064 --> 00:01:04.796
cuz it sounds more complicated
than it actually is.

17
00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:12.028
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Basically, the strategy is,

18
00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:15.815
we're gonna get the secret
from the params.

19
00:01:15.815 --> 00:01:17.535
If you don't have a secret, who are you?

20
00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:18.441
Get out of here.

21
00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:21.808
So we're gonna say no.

22
00:01:21.808 --> 00:01:26.398
If the secret doesn't equal the secret
we have in our environment variable,

23
00:01:26.398 --> 00:01:29.512
then also,
did we type that in on CONTENTFUL wrong.

24
00:01:29.512 --> 00:01:33.415
Or does someone know that we need a seeker
and they're just guessing at this point,

25
00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:35.109
either way, that's terrifying.

26
00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.087
And then lastly, you might have
some logic here where if you added

27
00:01:40.087 --> 00:01:44.974
some of those interpolated values
on the URL to get this hero ID,

28
00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:50.330
get this entry ID, you would use some
server side queries to get that.

29
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.887
But in our case,
our hero is gonna to be on the homepage,

30
00:01:55.887 --> 00:02:00.754
so we just need to just
redirect to the homepage.

31
00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:04.220
And then we just need to tell
Contentful on that server component

32
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.532
to use previews and then we should be
good, but not before enabling draft mode.

33
00:02:08.532 --> 00:02:11.278
So let's do that.

34
00:02:11.278 --> 00:02:17.059
So here we will go to our route,
that's right.

35
00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:23.592
So we'll say,
const GET =() a function export,

36
00:02:23.592 --> 00:02:29.097
or excuse, just export good, there we go.

37
00:02:29.097 --> 00:02:33.966
This is gonna be async or,
I don't think any

38
00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:39.364
spacing there actually,
looking at a request,

39
00:02:39.364 --> 00:02:44.632
this is a type NextRequest
from next/server,

40
00:02:44.632 --> 00:02:50.446
and then we will get
the searchParams from a new URL.

41
00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:54.820
And we'll pass in request.url.

42
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.109
We'll get the searchParams.

43
00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:00.594
And then we can say,
secret = searchParams.get(secret),

44
00:03:00.594 --> 00:03:03.430
that's the parameter we put
on the end of the URL, or

45
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.967
at least that's what I
put on the end of my URL.

46
00:03:05.967 --> 00:03:10.838
In my preview settings in Contentful,
I had a query string, secret = mySecret,

47
00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:14.239
whatever your variable was,
that's what you put here.

48
00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.319
So I'm going to get my secret.

49
00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.687
I'm gonna say, if not secrets,

50
00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:28.924
then return new Response.

51
00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:33.928
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I do a status on here.

52
00:03:33.928 --> 00:03:35.754
New Response().status?

53
00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:38.141
No, that's not it.

54
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:41.156
It's just the second argument, okay.

55
00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:45.844
So we'll say, No, {status: 400},

56
00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:49.527
you didn't send the right thing.

57
00:03:49.527 --> 00:03:58.444
If secret does not equal
process.env.whatever that thing is,

58
00:03:58.444 --> 00:04:03.152
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_SECRET,

59
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.271
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Then it's very similar.

60
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:15.691
Just different status of, all right, you
said the right thing, but it's not right.

61
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:17.786
So you got that.

62
00:04:20.376 --> 00:04:25.381
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then the last thing
we need to do is enable draftMode,

63
00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:31.345
so we can get draftMode from
the Next.js import from next headers.

64
00:04:31.345 --> 00:04:34.591
Which basically just, it really is
just a cookie that sets like draft,

65
00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:37.419
you don't even really need to use it,
you can do it yourself.

66
00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.139
You can just set any cookie that you want,
give it a value to true, look for

67
00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.108
that cookie on the other side, and then
pass it into your server side queries.

68
00:04:45.108 --> 00:04:51.934
But we'll get it from next headers.

69
00:04:51.934 --> 00:04:56.393
DraftMode, so we'll say

70
00:04:56.393 --> 00:05:03.901
draftMode().enable(), like this.

71
00:05:03.901 --> 00:05:10.488
And then we will redirect
from Next Navigation to Home.

72
00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:18.010
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And we're going home
because that's where the hero page is, or

73
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.273
the hero section is.

74
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.090
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You wanna redirect the user
to where the content they're clicking

75
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.609
preview on would be rendered so
they can actually see that.

76
00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:33.486
So you can tell it can get pretty
complicated if you have some content

77
00:05:33.486 --> 00:05:35.330
hidden behind an interaction.

78
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.368
So you redirect them there but
you gotta click this drop down and

79
00:05:38.368 --> 00:05:40.958
click this button and
then they'll see the content.

80
00:05:40.958 --> 00:05:45.899
So that can't be helped,
but it works pretty good.

81
00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:48.230
This is bare minimum this is bare minimum.

82
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:54.041
And this is for the really savvy content
creators that understand technology.

83
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:58.181
For people who are just pure content,
this is probably not enough for them,

84
00:05:58.181 --> 00:06:02.584
they're gonna need some like Squarespace
where they can click on the website and

85
00:06:02.584 --> 00:06:04.672
edit it in line and do stuff like that.

86
00:06:04.672 --> 00:06:08.036
This isn't gonna be good enough for
them, in my experience,

87
00:06:08.036 --> 00:06:10.765
as someone who's built this and
tried to sell it.

88
00:06:10.765 --> 00:06:15.142
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Because even if there's
a sub page that has a hero, right?

89
00:06:15.142 --> 00:06:19.762
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, exactly, exactly,
because they don't know exactly, like,

90
00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:21.995
even if you bring them to the page,

91
00:06:21.995 --> 00:06:27.176
they still have hard time figuring out
where on the page this thing actually is.

92
00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:30.547
Whereas an editor where you can click and
edit, it makes sense,

93
00:06:30.547 --> 00:06:34.243
it shows you borders when you click on it,
it's just more intuitive.

94
00:06:34.243 --> 00:06:38.163
So just,
it has to be somewhat really savvy.

95
00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:39.613
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Like the mental model.

96
00:06:39.613 --> 00:06:41.580
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, exactly.

97
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.865
So, this is like bare minimum.

98
00:06:43.865 --> 00:06:48.307
Okay, so we got that, so let's test
that at least it redirects, right?

99
00:06:48.307 --> 00:06:49.596
Let's test that part.

100
00:06:49.596 --> 00:06:55.930
So let's go back to here, open this tab.

101
00:06:57.564 --> 00:06:58.447
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, it redirects.

102
00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:01.510
So that means the secret works,
the cookie, all that stuff works,

103
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.515
let's check to see if our cookie's there.

104
00:07:03.515 --> 00:07:08.028
So I'm gonna go to Application,

105
00:07:08.028 --> 00:07:11.581
I'm gonna go to Cookies.

106
00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:16.992
And yeah, so it's actually this
cookie right here, prerender_bypass,

107
00:07:16.992 --> 00:07:21.652
that's the draftMode cookie,
it's just prerender_bypass.

108
00:07:21.652 --> 00:07:26.191
Cuz that's what the draftMode does,
it bypasses the prerender.

109
00:07:26.191 --> 00:07:32.130
Let's actually get the official
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Thing

110
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.820
from Next.js on what draftMode does.

111
00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.382
So basically,
static rendering is useful for

112
00:07:38.382 --> 00:07:41.348
your pages,
when you fetch data from a headless CMS.

113
00:07:41.348 --> 00:07:44.306
However, it's not ideal when you're
writing a draft on your CMS and

114
00:07:44.306 --> 00:07:46.501
you wanna view the draft
immediately on your page.

115
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:51.615
You want Next.js to render these pages at
request time instead of build time and

116
00:07:51.615 --> 00:07:55.448
fetch the draft content instead
of the published content.

117
00:07:55.448 --> 00:07:58.459
You'd want Next.js to switch
to dynamic rendering only for

118
00:07:58.459 --> 00:07:59.883
this specific case, yeah.

119
00:07:59.883 --> 00:08:01.900
Because all of our pages are going
to be rendered statically.

120
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.905
If you want to say, I mean,
actually, can you just be dynamic,

121
00:08:04.905 --> 00:08:08.935
which basically means don't cache this, go
and fetch the new one every single time.

122
00:08:08.935 --> 00:08:13.840
Be dynamic as if I used cookies,
as if I used headers,

123
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.007
as if I said no cache, basically.

124
00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:21.313
So, that's what it's gonna do.

125
00:08:21.313 --> 00:08:26.170
So the re-rendering or
the redirecting works, now what we need to

126
00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:30.951
do is if we go to our hero,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: We can get the draft mode

127
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:34.969
in here, so
we can say draftMode from next/headers and

128
00:08:34.969 --> 00:08:40.029
then we can say, we need to make
this function, getContentForHero.

129
00:08:40.029 --> 00:08:42.541
Take in an optional draft.

130
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:48.490
So we'll say isDraft, and
this can be a boolean.

131
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.427
All right, I'll just say,
default to false actually.

132
00:08:52.427 --> 00:08:59.257
So it'll say isDraft, and
then what we need to do if it is a draft,

133
00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:05.359
we need to pass that in as
an argument to our GraphQL query.

134
00:09:05.359 --> 00:09:10.374
And then also here, because this content
GraphQL takes in a preview true or

135
00:09:10.374 --> 00:09:14.287
false, so it can switch with
authorization token it has.

136
00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:18.782
Because you cannot access preview content
with the access token, you have to use

137
00:09:18.782 --> 00:09:22.828
the CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN
to access preview content.

138
00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:26.081
So let's fix that.

139
00:09:26.081 --> 00:09:28.456
So there are a couple ways
to pass it in with GraphQL.

140
00:09:28.456 --> 00:09:31.437
There's the right way,
there's the way we're gonna do it.

141
00:09:31.437 --> 00:09:36.207
So, the way that we're gonna do it [LAUGH]
is we're just gonna just skip this and

142
00:09:36.207 --> 00:09:38.605
we're just going to go straight here.

143
00:09:38.605 --> 00:09:43.594
And we're just gonna say, so luckily for
us, if we go, just to show you,

144
00:09:43.594 --> 00:09:48.422
and also just to make sure I'm not insane,
every query from Contentful

145
00:09:48.422 --> 00:09:52.870
should take in a preview like this,
and it could be true or false.

146
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:55.664
So every single query takes in a preview,
true or false.

147
00:09:55.664 --> 00:10:01.550
So what that enables us
to do is to go here and

148
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:06.291
say, okay, preview, cool, and

149
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:12.352
then we can interpolate and say, isDraft.

150
00:10:12.352 --> 00:10:16.016
So if isDraft, then we want true and

151
00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:21.032
double quotes and
false if not in double quotes.

152
00:10:21.032 --> 00:10:23.531
It has to be that,
has to be the double quotes.

153
00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:28.808
Graphical syntax,
this has to be in double quotes.

154
00:10:32.288 --> 00:10:36.496
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So we got that, and
then down here, we can say preview.

155
00:10:36.496 --> 00:10:38.453
It's gonna be bound to isDraft.

156
00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:43.969
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so now we have that.

157
00:10:43.969 --> 00:10:49.026
So this will enable us to
get the draft content.

158
00:10:51.513 --> 00:10:53.910
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: If we set it up right.

159
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.783
Who knows?

160
00:10:54.783 --> 00:10:57.988
You can also pass this all
the way down cuz like,

161
00:10:57.988 --> 00:11:02.797
all right, it'll get these items,
these will be draft but then like,

162
00:11:02.797 --> 00:11:06.427
what if you want to get
the draft version of these two?

163
00:11:06.427 --> 00:11:11.250
So you could also come down here and
say, yeah, I'll do the same thing,

164
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.860
and it cascades, you'd have to do
it that way as well, for relations.

165
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:21.656
Okay, so, let's make sure nothing broke,
first of all.

166
00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:23.338
Let's go here.

167
00:11:23.338 --> 00:11:25.515
Let's go Home.

168
00:11:25.515 --> 00:11:28.668
Nothing seems to be broken there,
let's go back to our CMS.

169
00:11:28.668 --> 00:11:31.803
That's cool, let's open this up again.

170
00:11:31.803 --> 00:11:33.039
That seems to be cool.

171
00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:37.700
Okay, nothing seems to have broke,
I think our cookie is still set.

172
00:11:39.272 --> 00:11:42.236
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It is, okay, and

173
00:11:42.236 --> 00:11:47.386
let's actually make a draft.

174
00:11:49.934 --> 00:11:52.976
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Which, you don't do
anything to make a draft, you just,

175
00:11:52.976 --> 00:11:55.831
you know you have a draft
when it says Publish Changes,

176
00:11:55.831 --> 00:11:57.835
that's how you know you have a draft.

177
00:11:57.835 --> 00:12:02.678
If didn't have a draft,
it would have said it was published.

178
00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:07.266
So we have a draft, this is my draft.

179
00:12:07.266 --> 00:12:11.891
If I want to preview this,
if we set this up,

180
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:16.767
this should do it, but
looks like it didn't.

181
00:12:16.767 --> 00:12:23.440
Let's see
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's check out if,

182
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.810
wait, I didn't pass it in, did I?

183
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.259
Yeah, I guess we gotta do that.

184
00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:33.062
So let's go here and we'll say,

185
00:12:33.062 --> 00:12:41.574
isDraft = draftMode.isEnabled, like that.

186
00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:48.681
So let me say isDraft, there we go.

187
00:12:48.681 --> 00:12:51.779
And it showed up immediately,
as soon as I hit Save.

188
00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:53.762
So let's just go through it all again.

189
00:12:53.762 --> 00:12:56.085
So we go here, here's our draft.

190
00:12:56.085 --> 00:12:57.423
Let's just change it again.

191
00:13:00.888 --> 00:13:03.498
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Kinda draft here.

192
00:13:03.498 --> 00:13:06.026
Wait for it to save, it just saved.

193
00:13:06.026 --> 00:13:11.116
Open this up, and it didn't show that one,

194
00:13:11.116 --> 00:13:14.978
it's showing the previous one.

195
00:13:14.978 --> 00:13:18.199
So maybe it didn't save yet,
let's give it some time, I guess.

196
00:13:20.895 --> 00:13:24.030
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There it is,
I guess it just takes a minute for

197
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:28.487
Contentful's preview or
draft content that goes to their CDN,

198
00:13:28.487 --> 00:13:32.790
I guess I didn't expect
the consequence to click that quick.

199
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:37.089
So it just took a minute, but areas,
so now you can see the draft.

200
00:13:37.089 --> 00:13:41.052
Typically what I would do is,
when I detect that you're in draft mode,

201
00:13:41.052 --> 00:13:43.044
I'll add a UI somewhere on the app.

202
00:13:43.044 --> 00:13:46.460
I'll put a border or
something, or a button or

203
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:51.291
something that says,
you are in preview mode, this is not live.

204
00:13:51.291 --> 00:13:54.287
Because right now we're doing
this on a local host, but

205
00:13:54.287 --> 00:13:56.919
you're gonna set this up
on the production app.

206
00:13:56.919 --> 00:14:00.636
The concept people aren't gonna run
a local host version of a website.

207
00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:06.181
So the URL that we put in for the preview
would have been yourwebsite.com/api/draft.

208
00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:07.750
It would have been local host.

209
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:11.207
So just to let them know that I
would put a button there that says,

210
00:14:11.207 --> 00:14:15.497
you are in draft, and I'll put another
button next to it that when you click it,

211
00:14:15.497 --> 00:14:19.755
it clears the cookie to say, okay, cool,
I don't look at the draft anymore.

212
00:14:19.755 --> 00:14:23.526
And that's the experience
that you wanna show.

213
00:14:23.526 --> 00:14:30.660
And to clear the cookie, it's pretty
simple, you just make another route,

214
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.294
and it just calls draftMode().disable().

215
00:14:35.294 --> 00:14:36.890
That's it,
you just make a route that does that.

216
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.238
That's it, and that clears the clicker.

217
00:14:39.238 --> 00:14:44.591
So, put a button on your page that makes
a call to this and clears the cookie.
