00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.159
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: As far as some of the most
used cases that I wanted to cover when

2
00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:10.126
it comes to headless CMS with Next.js,
we covered them.

3
00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:13.771
There's a lot more for
us to do just going through this page, but

4
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:15.336
they're mostly the same.

5
00:00:15.336 --> 00:00:19.659
We talked about iterating over lists,
we talked about relational types and

6
00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.517
how to query those things,
everything's kind of mostly the same.

7
00:00:23.517 --> 00:00:26.927
What really starts to change is just,
and this is why it was really hard for

8
00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.632
you to create notes for this course.

9
00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:32.935
It's like, it's how you think about it and
how your relationship is with the people

10
00:00:32.935 --> 00:00:35.614
in your team that are gonna
be adding to the content.

11
00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:40.801
Because there's nothing stopping
you from putting every single

12
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:46.362
thing you see as far as like text,
assets, even layout positioning,

13
00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:50.432
and even things like color
inside of headless CMS.

14
00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:55.683
But at that point, you're basically
building a website builder from forms.

15
00:00:55.683 --> 00:00:57.492
So, that's not the best interface.

16
00:00:57.492 --> 00:01:02.332
If someone said, hey,
you can build this website

17
00:01:02.332 --> 00:01:06.838
by using forms or not like,
[LAUGH] what's on?

18
00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:08.777
What wrong would you do?

19
00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:10.514
You probably say not.

20
00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:14.983
So, it's like this tug and
pull situation, so

21
00:01:14.983 --> 00:01:20.701
you start to see people doing
some of those on-site things.

22
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:24.327
So what I wanna talk about now is just
kind of take a tour through some of

23
00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:25.704
the other CMSs out there,

24
00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:29.667
and how they do some different features
that I think you might find useful.

25
00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:31.923
So that way,
if you're gonna go forward from this and

26
00:01:31.923 --> 00:01:34.128
pick a CMS to try to figure
out what you wanna work on,

27
00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:37.054
at least you've heard some of my
opinions if you find them valuable.

28
00:01:37.054 --> 00:01:41.188
Because, I mean, I'm pretty, I'm not as
deep in this space, I was since I'm not

29
00:01:41.188 --> 00:01:44.992
working on how to CMS, but I usually I do
stay up to date on a lot of the things.

30
00:01:44.992 --> 00:01:48.204
So the one that I do wanna
dive into is Builder.io,

31
00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:51.059
I think I talked a little
bit about it before.

32
00:01:51.059 --> 00:01:55.298
But this one's pretty cool, this one,
so I talked about open source,

33
00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:57.145
I talked about closed source.

34
00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:58.965
This one is closed source, but

35
00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:03.381
it's like it sits somewhere in the middle
between just a website builder.

36
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:08.607
To me, I think of it as a headless website
builder, because you can actually use

37
00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:13.833
a headless CMS with it, even though it
does also have a headless CMS component.

38
00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:16.957
It's everything, which can be good or bad.

39
00:02:16.957 --> 00:02:18.701
But it's pretty cool.

40
00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:20.932
This one, basically, you see,

41
00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:25.485
they have a graphic that I wanted to show,
let me see if they have it.

42
00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:27.451
It's not on this page.

43
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:30.228
Yeah, I'm being AB tested.

44
00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:34.638
But they have a graphic where it kinda
shows you like kinda where it sits,

45
00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:37.167
but as you can see in
this demo right here,

46
00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:41.308
you can pull up on your site just
like this in this app that they have.

47
00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:45.791
You can look at everything from
heat maps that they showed you,

48
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:49.526
to editing inventory,
to getting down to the code.

49
00:02:49.526 --> 00:02:51.567
It's pretty complex.

50
00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:54.208
And I think it's gonna be for
those people who,

51
00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:58.981
it's basically like building your own web
flow, it's the best way I can describe t.

52
00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:03.043
So if you wanna build your own web flow,
go use Builder, that's what it is.

53
00:03:03.043 --> 00:03:08.384
so to me, that's kinda like a technically
inclined design person, I guess.

54
00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:13.382
So it's a different market, but
this is what pushing that limit of we

55
00:03:13.382 --> 00:03:17.446
don't wanna edit on the form to,
this is where it goes.

56
00:03:17.446 --> 00:03:23.314
So that's Builder, they also do a lot of
AI stuff, and they move really quickly.

57
00:03:23.314 --> 00:03:27.807
I know the Builder team there,
Mishko, the guy who created Angler,

58
00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.210
is the CTO there now.

59
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.649
And they're just a very, very strong team,
I respect a lot of stuff that they do.

60
00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:36.815
And what they're doing with the AI,
I haven't tried it out yet, but

61
00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.845
what I can say is that
they move really fast.

62
00:03:38.845 --> 00:03:43.612
And it's probably worth a try,
at least just to see what's possible.

63
00:03:43.612 --> 00:03:45.150
So Builder is really cool.

64
00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.471
Another one that you might wanna
check out is called Prismic.

65
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:53.818
Only reason I'm bringing this one up
is cuz I've used it in the past and

66
00:03:53.818 --> 00:03:55.953
I thought it was quite simple, but

67
00:03:55.953 --> 00:04:00.460
they have this interesting concept called,
let me see if I can show you.

68
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.726
It's called a Slice Machine.

69
00:04:01.726 --> 00:04:06.123
So, a Slice Machine,
let me see if I can get this right.

70
00:04:06.123 --> 00:04:10.634
A Slice Machine is basically like taking
a section of your website, it's basically

71
00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:15.221
like, you have components on your app, now
you have components and content as well.

72
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:17.287
They match one for one.

73
00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:20.997
So it's like, I have like,

74
00:04:20.997 --> 00:04:26.297
if we go back to our website,
if we go back here,

75
00:04:26.297 --> 00:04:33.601
you can think of a Slice is like
this thing, this might be a Slice.

76
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:37.879
This might be a Slice, this whole bento
box UI in the subtitle is a Slice.

77
00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:42.073
So you can make these slices, and that
way, the people who are designing content

78
00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:45.356
can drag and drop and pick the slices and
do whatever they want.

79
00:04:45.356 --> 00:04:49.105
And because they're bound to some
component that has a visual output,

80
00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:52.052
they can show them that in a preview much,
much better.

81
00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:53.664
You can even take a screenshot of it,

82
00:04:53.664 --> 00:04:56.061
so they can see a screenshot
of what it would look like.

83
00:04:56.061 --> 00:05:00.788
In Prismic, they used to have a hosted
editor, kind of like what Contentful has,

84
00:05:00.788 --> 00:05:03.132
that is now called their legacy editor.

85
00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:06.114
And the only reason I know that,
cuz I was gonna use this for the course,

86
00:05:06.114 --> 00:05:08.947
I was like, I think Prismic is
like the most simplest, basic,

87
00:05:08.947 --> 00:05:11.374
headless CMS out there,
which is great for this course.

88
00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:14.125
But then I realized like, no,
you gotta download a thing now, and

89
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:15.511
you gotta do all these things now.

90
00:05:15.511 --> 00:05:18.035
And it's like sanity now.

91
00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:22.242
So, check it out,
it's kinda cool, I guess.

92
00:05:22.242 --> 00:05:24.343
I haven't tried it out, but it looks cool.

93
00:05:24.343 --> 00:05:28.033
So, you got that,
I talked about sanity already, so

94
00:05:28.033 --> 00:05:30.988
I'm not gonna talk too much more about it.

95
00:05:30.988 --> 00:05:34.954
Here is a Storyblock,

96
00:05:34.954 --> 00:05:39.973
yeah, Storyblock, okay.

97
00:05:39.973 --> 00:05:41.585
I can't remember if they
were still around or not.

98
00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:43.953
So, Storyblock is kind of cool,

99
00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:49.212
I think they were one of the first
visual headless CMS builders out there.

100
00:05:49.212 --> 00:05:50.852
They were definitely
one of the first ones.

101
00:05:50.852 --> 00:05:54.349
I know that because they came to market
after my product came to market,

102
00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.378
I remember them coming to market and
they were like, yeah,

103
00:05:57.378 --> 00:05:59.155
we're gonna do this visual thing.

104
00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:01.455
And I was like,
I don't know if that's the way, and

105
00:06:01.455 --> 00:06:04.610
that's because we were still thinking
we were selling to developers.

106
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.734
And I'm like,
developers don't want a visual editor,

107
00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:10.280
they just wanna fill out forms and
use the API.

108
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.520
But the people who
are creating the content and

109
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.520
experiencing the content need this,
this kinda helps them.

110
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.247
So, can't tell if it's good or bad,
I can just tell you that they did it for

111
00:06:20.247 --> 00:06:23.193
a while, seems useful,
you can check it out.

112
00:06:23.193 --> 00:06:25.533
But yeah, that one's really good.

113
00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:28.694
And then I would say,
this one is less of a CMS and

114
00:06:28.694 --> 00:06:31.317
more of a competitor web flow for sure.

115
00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:36.205
But if you haven't checked out Framer
in a while, Framer is no longer

116
00:06:36.205 --> 00:06:41.024
just an animation library,
it is now a full blown website builder.

117
00:06:41.024 --> 00:06:43.127
And honestly, it's quite impressive.

118
00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:47.447
It's probably the only website
builder that I've used, I'm like,

119
00:06:47.447 --> 00:06:52.363
all right, I'm still never gonna use this,
but [LAUGH] I was really impressed.

120
00:06:52.363 --> 00:06:56.521
Like, the code that it outputs and how it
does it, and the fact that you can go in

121
00:06:56.521 --> 00:06:59.678
and edit things really simple,
the app works really good.

122
00:06:59.678 --> 00:07:04.209
But the biggest feature is that, I can
go get a Figma design right now, give it

123
00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:09.193
to Framer, and then within two seconds
it's a website, I'll just click Publish.

124
00:07:09.193 --> 00:07:12.765
So I can publish a Figma design and
it turns it into a website immediately,

125
00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.678
which is to me, is really impressive.

126
00:07:14.678 --> 00:07:20.237
So, it's really cool, they have
this really cool, where is it at?

127
00:07:20.237 --> 00:07:24.980
Templates, where are their templates?

128
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:25.776
I know they have some.

129
00:07:29.314 --> 00:07:30.357
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Let's see.

130
00:07:30.357 --> 00:07:35.770
Framer, literally, okay,
why would they not be on their website?

131
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:37.211
That's crazy.

132
00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:40.360
They have a lot of them,
they got some really cool looking website,

133
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.306
a lot of designers make a living
off selling Framer templates.

134
00:07:43.306 --> 00:07:46.507
This one looks absolutely insane.

135
00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:47.660
What, who made this?

136
00:07:49.597 --> 00:07:50.126
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I don't know.

137
00:07:50.126 --> 00:07:51.096
This one's really good, though.

138
00:07:51.096 --> 00:07:55.359
It's really great for people who do React,
cuz it's all React-based,

139
00:07:55.359 --> 00:07:56.398
the output of it.

140
00:07:56.398 --> 00:08:01.155
There's a desktop app, it works in
the web, it's basically like Figma.

141
00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:03.463
If Figma allows you to make a website,
that's Framer,

142
00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:05.093
that's the best way I can describe it.

143
00:08:05.093 --> 00:08:05.674
It's pretty cool.

144
00:08:05.674 --> 00:08:09.424
Whereas Webflow is geared
towards more designers,

145
00:08:09.424 --> 00:08:14.205
Framer is geared towards engineers
who don't know how to design.

146
00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:21.841
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And there are a lot of
other ones out there for sure, but

147
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:26.825
I think those are the only ones that
I think, off the top of my head,

148
00:08:26.825 --> 00:08:30.582
that I can think of that
you might wanna check out.

149
00:08:30.582 --> 00:08:33.357
And then from there,
when we talk about production,

150
00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:37.798
since we didn't really get to that because
it really isn't that much different other

151
00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:40.346
than the cash revalidating
that I talked about.

152
00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:44.023
You just need to make sure a lot of these
CMSs have different URLs that they use in

153
00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:46.096
production than they do, not production.

154
00:08:46.096 --> 00:08:48.177
So make sure you use the right URLs.

155
00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:48.818
And then,

156
00:08:48.818 --> 00:08:53.315
you should try to avoid having to
rebuild your app when something changes.

157
00:08:53.315 --> 00:08:56.429
So take advantage of web plugs,
take advantage of revalidating,

158
00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:59.831
take advantage of all those things so
you're not rebuilding your site.

159
00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:03.798
like, this isn't 2016 gas feed anymore,
so you don't need to do that.

160
00:09:03.798 --> 00:09:05.245
Hopefully you're not doing that.

161
00:09:05.245 --> 00:09:09.886
And then the other thing I get
a question about with headless CMS is,

162
00:09:09.886 --> 00:09:13.152
can I use headless CMS
outside of a static site?

163
00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:15.348
Can I use it on a mobile app?

164
00:09:15.348 --> 00:09:18.746
Can I use it behind a login,
like on the dashboard?

165
00:09:18.746 --> 00:09:20.727
Sure, you can use
the headless CMS anywhere.

166
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.618
A headless CMS is
basically a repository for

167
00:09:23.618 --> 00:09:26.516
data that your colleagues create, right?

168
00:09:26.516 --> 00:09:28.058
It's still data, right?

169
00:09:28.058 --> 00:09:30.897
When we think of data, we think of
the data that a user creates, but

170
00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:32.794
what about the data
that your team creates?

171
00:09:32.794 --> 00:09:37.305
That's what a headless CMS is for, so you
have a lot of data that your team creates,

172
00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:40.012
and if it belongs on the screen
in one of your apps,

173
00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:42.663
then you might feel free
to use the headless CMS.

174
00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:45.135
So yes, you can totally use it.

175
00:09:45.135 --> 00:09:47.633
There's been cases where
we've done that before,

176
00:09:47.633 --> 00:09:51.614
where we'll put things in the headless CMS
that get rendered somewhere in the app.

177
00:09:51.614 --> 00:09:56.664
And those might be the text that might
show up on a own boarding flow cuz maybe

178
00:09:56.664 --> 00:10:01.475
we want someone who's not technical
to manage that onboarding flow and

179
00:10:01.475 --> 00:10:02.453
what it says.

180
00:10:02.453 --> 00:10:04.369
So that's a great use case.

181
00:10:04.369 --> 00:10:07.690
It might be like, if you show a modal
that pops up when someone signs up for

182
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.269
the first time and it greets them,

183
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:12.008
maybe that's something you
wanna put in the headless CMS.

184
00:10:12.008 --> 00:10:14.824
So that can be changed by
someone who's not technical.

185
00:10:14.824 --> 00:10:18.510
So there's things like that where there's
a lot of crossover that you might

186
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:19.268
wanna do that.

187
00:10:19.268 --> 00:10:21.356
On the mobile app, kind of the same thing,

188
00:10:21.356 --> 00:10:24.956
there's different scenarios where
maybe you wanna change some things.

189
00:10:24.956 --> 00:10:28.890
I've actually used the headless CMS to
change the layout of a mobile app, so

190
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.809
I didn't have to go to the app store.

191
00:10:30.809 --> 00:10:33.672
And I didn't feel like setting up
a backend, so I just use a headless CMS.

192
00:10:33.672 --> 00:10:35.764
That was really cool, so
you can do stuff like that.

193
00:10:35.764 --> 00:10:39.413
So it isn't just for
putting text on a website,

194
00:10:39.413 --> 00:10:43.075
there's a lot of different use cases for
this.

195
00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:49.017
And then now the fact that everything,
you can get an LLM with just an API call,

196
00:10:49.017 --> 00:10:53.881
an LLM is basically something
that can take unstructured data,

197
00:10:53.881 --> 00:10:59.494
like output of a rich text, take
something like that and make sense of it.

198
00:10:59.494 --> 00:11:05.606
You might even find it useful to hit
the API for a headless CMS server side and

199
00:11:05.606 --> 00:11:09.888
do some type of analysis
there as well using the LLM.

200
00:11:09.888 --> 00:11:13.383
So I bet there's tons of different use
cases there that people are still gonna

201
00:11:13.383 --> 00:11:14.578
figure out in the future.

202
00:11:14.578 --> 00:11:17.984
So it's not just putting text on a screen,
that's just where all the money is.

203
00:11:17.984 --> 00:11:19.632
That's the biggest need.

204
00:11:19.632 --> 00:11:22.004
But if you already have one and
you're using one,

205
00:11:22.004 --> 00:11:25.633
you're not limited to just that,
you can pretty much do whatever you want.

206
00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:28.029
So, think a little bit
outside the box there.
