1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.375
Scott: The next thing we want to do
is now that we have this fetcher,

2
00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.030
we need to go to contentful.

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.870
We need to create a content model.

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.627
I think that's what it's called, a content
model for the header that we just talked

5
00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:17.049
about, and then create an actual document,
use this fetcher, pull it down,

6
00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:21.078
call it in the hero, and then render
it in place of the static content.

7
00:00:21.078 --> 00:00:24.265
So a couple steps involved, but
we don't have to do that once for

8
00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:28.088
that setup and then after that it's
just more queries and we're good to go.

9
00:00:28.088 --> 00:00:32.688
So I'm going to show you my flow
on how I like to do things I'm

10
00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:34.736
doing like caching here.

11
00:00:34.736 --> 00:00:35.944
We'll talk about it later.

12
00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:39.714
I'm going to show you my flow and
how I like to do things when it comes to

13
00:00:39.714 --> 00:00:43.536
figuring out what query I need,
bringing it in, making the types.

14
00:00:43.536 --> 00:00:46.480
It's pretty simple, so
nothing complicated.

15
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.576
And then here I'm just going to go
ahead and just resolve everything.

16
00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:55.698
So I'll just say awaits res.json.

17
00:00:55.698 --> 00:01:01.469
I'll await that and then GraphQL always
typically if there isn't an error,

18
00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.138
there'll be a data property or
an errors property like this.

19
00:01:06.138 --> 00:01:12.634
So I'll just say if errors,
for now do something here.

20
00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:16.739
But we'll just say throw new error,

21
00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:21.650
not get content, I'll also just log them.

22
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.190
Otherwise just return the data.

23
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.062
Because with GraphQL it's always going
to be a 200 even if it's an error.

24
00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:35.990
So that's why I'm not
checking status codes here.

25
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.974
Even it errored out,
it's going to send back a 200.

26
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.238
It'll just send you back
an array of errors here instead.

27
00:01:41.238 --> 00:01:45.848
Okay, let's go make some shapes.

28
00:01:45.848 --> 00:01:46.536
Let's get to it.

29
00:01:46.536 --> 00:01:47.776
Okay, so content model.

30
00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:54.280
So click on content model at the top and
you should see something like this.

31
00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.304
Unless we're being A B tested and
you see something different,

32
00:01:57.304 --> 00:01:59.520
you can say design your
first content model.

33
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.544
So you can think of this as
like a table for a database.

34
00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:02.944
It's basically what this is.

35
00:02:02.944 --> 00:02:04.392
We're designing a schema right now.

36
00:02:04.392 --> 00:02:08.456
The open sources allow
you to do this in code.

37
00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.052
So you'll use JSON or
whatever their thing is and

38
00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:13.058
you can design your schema and code.

39
00:02:13.058 --> 00:02:17.050
And then because you're hosting it,
it doesn't matter.

40
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.370
So we're going to call this one hero.

41
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.314
So there's many approaches
before we get into this.

42
00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:28.955
When it comes to data modeling for
there's the approach where you design,

43
00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:31.106
you create a schema for a whole page.

44
00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:35.646
So we go through that whole page and
we'll make fields and sub fields for

45
00:02:35.646 --> 00:02:37.454
everything on that page.

46
00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:38.694
And there's nothing wrong with that.

47
00:02:38.694 --> 00:02:40.054
I've done that before in the past.

48
00:02:40.054 --> 00:02:42.950
But for this approach,
I'm not going to do it that way.

49
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.366
And the reason is because I want to
take advantage of server components.

50
00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:51.882
What server components with
next.js 13+ is that each component

51
00:02:51.882 --> 00:02:58.710
can make its own call to get whatever
content that it needs specifically.

52
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.077
That way you can put those
components anywhere and

53
00:03:01.077 --> 00:03:03.126
they'll still work exactly the same.

54
00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:07.669
Whereas if we render out an entire page,
let's say the sections or

55
00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.992
the subsections on that
page will be dependent on

56
00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:14.406
its parent passing in
the content that it needs.

57
00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:18.006
So therefore it's not as flexible anymore,
it's not as reusable.

58
00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:23.142
So if you have like a carousel component
that you want to use somewhere else,

59
00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:26.190
but it needs to take in a prop for
its content,

60
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.510
then now you got to make that call
again to pass it its content.

61
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.588
Whereas if it knew its own content, then
it could just call it itself no matter

62
00:03:34.588 --> 00:03:38.795
where it is, it's self containable,
it's a completely isolated instance,

63
00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:42.880
not even just in the component aspect,
but in the content aspect as well.

64
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.712
So we're going to take that approach.

65
00:03:44.712 --> 00:03:46.697
And some might be thinking like, wow,

66
00:03:46.697 --> 00:03:50.448
that might be a lot of API calls when
you go to a page, it's a static page.

67
00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:54.098
It's all going to get rendered at
build time and then deploy it,

68
00:03:54.098 --> 00:03:55.970
export it statically.

69
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.642
So no,
it's actually not that detrimental at all.

70
00:03:58.642 --> 00:04:02.244
And that's not even including things
like caching, revalidation, and

71
00:04:02.244 --> 00:04:04.162
we'll talk about a lot of that stuff.

72
00:04:04.162 --> 00:04:07.290
So yeah, that's the approach
that we're going to take.

73
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.786
So things are just super simple.

74
00:04:08.786 --> 00:04:11.599
This is going to allow us to move things
around and not have to worry about like,

75
00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.490
it's broken now because
you got to pass this in.

76
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:14.670
Not going to have that problem.

77
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.790
Any questions on that?

78
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.200
Okay, so got our Hero out of field.

79
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.708
First thing is we'll do the,
we'll make a text field.

80
00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:33.892
That'll be for the pre title.

81
00:04:33.892 --> 00:04:35.620
So I'll call this.

82
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.148
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hey Scott,
I've got one question.

83
00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:38.240
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yes, question, yes.

84
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.804
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Component
level data fetching.

85
00:04:40.804 --> 00:04:46.092
Almost all APIs have rate limits,
pretty low in most cases.

86
00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:48.045
So, you know, next.js build times,

87
00:04:48.045 --> 00:04:51.502
you're going to run into the rate
limit on the API pretty quickly.

88
00:04:51.502 --> 00:04:54.198
Contentful I just looked at
is 55 requests per second.

89
00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:55.394
&gt;&gt; Scott: How many requests per second?

90
00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:56.406
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 55 requests per second.

91
00:04:56.406 --> 00:04:58.614
You're going to beat
that up at build time.

92
00:04:58.614 --> 00:04:59.126
&gt;&gt; Scott: Yeah.

93
00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:02.134
So yes, a lot of them have rate limits.

94
00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:06.564
What I've realized,
it also just depends on,

95
00:05:06.564 --> 00:05:13.638
a lot of them have different APIs for
public content versus draft content.

96
00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:17.070
So for the public content ones-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's their delivery.

97
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.672
&gt;&gt; Scott: That's their delivery API?

98
00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:19.248
That's pretty low.

99
00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.373
So yeah, I mean, you would have to,
like in your fetcher,

100
00:05:21.373 --> 00:05:22.768
you would have to account for that.

101
00:05:22.768 --> 00:05:25.072
You'd have to throttle,
you'd have to just account.

102
00:05:25.072 --> 00:05:25.856
Look at the header.

103
00:05:25.856 --> 00:05:28.312
They'll tell you how long you
got until you can come back.

104
00:05:28.312 --> 00:05:33.270
But for me, I would probably, I'd probably
still build it with a content first

105
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.912
approach because I want to be
able to move things around.

106
00:05:36.912 --> 00:05:40.618
But also, for me, what I also realized
is like, when you make like one big page

107
00:05:40.618 --> 00:05:43.970
content model, that's where it
starts to get hard for the content.

108
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.804
The folks making the content,
it's so relational and so

109
00:05:48.804 --> 00:05:53.146
dependent on each other
that it's very fragile.

110
00:05:53.146 --> 00:05:56.284
You might have it to where if
someone renames this one field,

111
00:05:56.284 --> 00:05:57.514
it'll break my code.

112
00:05:57.514 --> 00:05:59.042
Or if you move this here, it'll break.

113
00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:03.242
So if everything's isolated,
it's a little simpler to think about.

114
00:06:03.242 --> 00:06:06.090
But yeah, rate limits, definitely.

115
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.676
That's so funny that that's, that the rate
limit is that low for something like that.

116
00:06:11.676 --> 00:06:12.836
That's crazy.

117
00:06:12.836 --> 00:06:14.580
But yeah, there's ways around that.

118
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:15.804
Thanks for bringing that up.

119
00:06:15.804 --> 00:06:18.764
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They really want you to
get into that $300 a month paid tier.

120
00:06:18.764 --> 00:06:19.268
&gt;&gt; Scott: There you go.

121
00:06:19.268 --> 00:06:20.164
That's what it is.

122
00:06:20.164 --> 00:06:21.132
They want you to get in there.

123
00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:24.372
So you make it, you can make a name here,
you can call whatever you want.

124
00:06:24.372 --> 00:06:28.260
I typically capitalize mine and
then that generates a field ID.

125
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.444
You can always change
the name no matter what, but

126
00:06:30.444 --> 00:06:32.292
the field ID typically never changes.

127
00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:35.812
This is the ID that appears in the API.

128
00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:39.736
So because you're creating
a dynamic schema,

129
00:06:39.736 --> 00:06:43.900
this is the field,
the field name for this thing.

130
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.460
So here,
you can pick different options here,

131
00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.252
I'm just gonna pick short text because
it's definitely less than 256 characters.

132
00:06:51.252 --> 00:06:52.560
So I'm just gonna say that.

133
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.892
I'm gonna say, I'm gonna check this box.

134
00:06:55.892 --> 00:06:57.916
This field represents the entry title.

135
00:06:57.916 --> 00:07:02.772
This basically just means that there's
a view where it shows you all the,

136
00:07:02.772 --> 00:07:05.710
let's say you make more than one hero.

137
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.078
This is how you identify it's this hero.

138
00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:13.677
I'm not gonna say it's the ID because
it doesn't have to be unique,

139
00:07:13.677 --> 00:07:18.326
but it's the field in which you can
identify this entry at a glance.

140
00:07:18.326 --> 00:07:19.984
So what field do you want to show so

141
00:07:19.984 --> 00:07:22.490
you know that you're
looking at a specific hero.

142
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:28.400
Some CMS's have a setting that would
be useful here where you can say,

143
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.658
I only want someone to be able to
make one hero and no other heroes.

144
00:07:32.658 --> 00:07:35.114
I don't think Contentful has that or
I don't know where it is.

145
00:07:35.114 --> 00:07:36.034
Some CMS's do have that.

146
00:07:36.034 --> 00:07:40.005
That's useful because you might have some
person on your team go make like three

147
00:07:40.005 --> 00:07:40.530
heroes.

148
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:43.362
But your code is expected
there to only be one hero.

149
00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.066
So which one are you getting back?

150
00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:46.554
So it can get pretty complicated.

151
00:07:46.554 --> 00:07:51.090
I don't think they have that option here,
but that needs to be required.

152
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:53.634
We will say you can limit if you want.

153
00:07:53.634 --> 00:07:55.420
You can do a regex here if you want.

154
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.196
You can do enums if you want.

155
00:07:57.196 --> 00:08:01.918
And then this is like the UI you want
your content folks to see when they fill

156
00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:03.044
this field out.

157
00:08:03.044 --> 00:08:07.372
So for this, I just want a single line,
just a straight up text input.

158
00:08:07.372 --> 00:08:10.203
It wouldn't make sense to put a URL or
dropdown or

159
00:08:10.203 --> 00:08:13.012
a radio select or
a slug that gets generated.

160
00:08:13.012 --> 00:08:14.068
So I'll do that.

161
00:08:14.068 --> 00:08:16.321
And then if they're struggling,

162
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:20.332
which they probably will be,
you can give them a hint here.

163
00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:21.624
So this will show up.

164
00:08:21.624 --> 00:08:25.920
So this right here is a preview
of what they're going to see.

165
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.944
So you can see that's
where the hint would go.

166
00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:33.966
So I would say the main title
on the homepage, you know,

167
00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:40.080
big words, you know,
like literally break this down.

168
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.280
I've seen some CMS's that allow
you to upload a screenshot here so

169
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.344
they can hover over and it's that thing.

170
00:08:47.344 --> 00:08:47.904
Okay.

171
00:08:47.904 --> 00:08:51.536
Because it could get, it's disconnected.

172
00:08:51.536 --> 00:08:52.560
That's the whole point of being headless.

173
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.020
It's like you're disconnected.

174
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.992
Okay, so we have our pre title.

175
00:08:58.992 --> 00:09:00.368
We now need to make another field.

176
00:09:00.368 --> 00:09:03.000
We're going to call this the title.

177
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.640
Same thing.

178
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.120
Same thing.

179
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.271
This one is, I'm actually, you know,
I want the title to be the,

180
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.168
represents the entry title.

181
00:09:11.168 --> 00:09:12.512
That makes more sense.

182
00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:16.498
This needs to be required and same thing.

183
00:09:16.498 --> 00:09:21.950
So here, this will be the subtitle.

184
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.710
All the same stuff required.

185
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:29.962
All that's good.

186
00:09:29.962 --> 00:09:32.930
And then what do we have?

187
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.978
We have the CTA's, right?

188
00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:36.850
CTA's are links with labels.

189
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.418
So that's a compound type.

190
00:09:38.418 --> 00:09:40.710
Well, I guess you could put
adjacent objects in here.

191
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.100
But we're not going to do that because
we're not going to take the easy way out.

192
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.136
I also want to list.

193
00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:54.768
So what we're going to do is we're going
to make a reference to another type,

194
00:09:54.768 --> 00:09:57.320
which means we need to make another type.

195
00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.096
So we're going to do that.

196
00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:00.560
But first let's save this here.

197
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:05.304
So now we have our hero type and
then I'm going to make a new type.

198
00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:07.496
I'm going back to the content model and

199
00:10:07.496 --> 00:10:10.230
I'm going to say create
a new content type here.

200
00:10:11.728 --> 00:10:14.181
They have a generate content type with AI.

201
00:10:14.181 --> 00:10:15.370
Wow.
Let's see if this works.

202
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.082
So let's see.

203
00:10:18.082 --> 00:10:20.154
Enter a short description on
the content type you want.

204
00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:28.195
I need a,
I don't even know how to describe this,

205
00:10:28.195 --> 00:10:32.668
button with text and href.

206
00:10:32.668 --> 00:10:33.470
Let's see.

207
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.050
Yeah, actually that works, good for them.

208
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.394
So I'm gonna go ahead and take that.

209
00:10:43.394 --> 00:10:45.482
And now we have our link.

210
00:10:45.482 --> 00:10:49.018
Our link is basically it has a text and
then it has an href.

211
00:10:49.018 --> 00:10:52.778
But most non technical people
don't know what an href is.

212
00:10:52.778 --> 00:10:58.652
So I'm gonna say link and
I'm gonna change that to link as well.

213
00:10:58.652 --> 00:11:00.724
So we'll do that.

214
00:11:00.724 --> 00:11:02.940
And this is required.

215
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.460
I'll make this not,
that doesn't have to be unique.

216
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.904
And I'm going to pick the URL UI so

217
00:11:09.904 --> 00:11:14.340
it looks like a URL
which makes more sense.

218
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.976
And I'll say relative or

219
00:11:18.976 --> 00:11:26.052
absolute URL for this call to action.

220
00:11:26.052 --> 00:11:29.516
I'll confirm that.

221
00:11:29.516 --> 00:11:34.635
And then for the text, I'll call it label.

222
00:11:34.635 --> 00:11:40.460
And I want this to
represent the entry title.

223
00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.080
This is also required.

224
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.980
This will just be single line text.

225
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:52.330
And this is just like the text for
the call to action.

226
00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.110
We'll do that.

227
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:01.830
Boom.

228
00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:04.090
Now we got that, easy.

229
00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.502
So let's finish adding these.

230
00:12:11.502 --> 00:12:15.830
Let's add the button
content model to the hero.

231
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:19.610
And then what we're going to
do is go back to our hero.

232
00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.330
Click add field, make a new field.

233
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.710
We're going to say reference.

234
00:12:25.610 --> 00:12:33.050
And the reference here, I'm just
going to say call to actions, plural.

235
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.690
And you see the bottom says one
reference or many references.

236
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.802
I want many because I want to be able
to have multiple call to actions.

237
00:12:38.802 --> 00:12:39.466
Right?

238
00:12:39.466 --> 00:12:43.360
So I'm going to say configure.

239
00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:51.740
And I'm going to say only
a specified number of entries.

240
00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:55.212
The hero has two, so
minimum of two, maximum of two.

241
00:12:55.212 --> 00:12:57.503
You got to give me two.

242
00:12:57.503 --> 00:13:01.244
And then accept only specified types.

243
00:13:01.244 --> 00:13:03.880
Yeah, I only want button types.

244
00:13:08.390 --> 00:13:09.942
And then what UI do you want to show?

245
00:13:09.942 --> 00:13:11.846
You want to show a card or
you want to show a list.

246
00:13:11.846 --> 00:13:13.790
Show me a list.

247
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.150
Cool.

248
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.132
Bulk editing, as in this is like a modal
that pops up where you can edit all the,

249
00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.326
in this case, buttons in one UI.

250
00:13:22.326 --> 00:13:23.189
Sure, why not?

251
00:13:23.189 --> 00:13:27.342
Create new entries if you don't
have one when you're making a hero.

252
00:13:27.342 --> 00:13:28.926
Can they make one in line right there?

253
00:13:28.926 --> 00:13:32.536
Or they need to leave and go to
the button and make it and come back and

254
00:13:32.536 --> 00:13:33.790
then link existing?

255
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:36.134
If you already have some,
can you just select one from a list?

256
00:13:36.134 --> 00:13:37.470
Yes, obviously we want that.

257
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.270
Why would we not?

258
00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.798
That should be default.

259
00:13:39.798 --> 00:13:41.780
Why would you not want that?

260
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.268
Okay, so we got that.

261
00:13:43.268 --> 00:13:49.260
Going to hit save and
now we have our first model ready to go.
