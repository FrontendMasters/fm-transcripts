00:00:00.071 --> 00:00:04.667
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: A headless CMS,
I think it's a silly name.

2
00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.837
[LAUGH] I don't know why we call it that,
but I get it.

3
00:00:07.837 --> 00:00:11.495
A headless CMS is basically a CMS
that doesn't build your website,

4
00:00:11.495 --> 00:00:14.778
although most headless CMSs
want to build your website now.

5
00:00:14.778 --> 00:00:18.774
Traditional CMSs manage your content for
you or allow you to manage your

6
00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:22.714
content admin interface where
you're basically filling out forms.

7
00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:27.629
Some of the more sophisticated ones will
allow you to visually edit you're talking

8
00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:31.349
like full blown site builders
the squarespaces of the world and

9
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.485
things like that.

10
00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:36.580
And then the other part is actually
building your website, right?

11
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.723
So there's like themes you can install,
you can use their custom language,

12
00:00:40.723 --> 00:00:42.519
on Shopify, it's like liquid.

13
00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.789
On Squarespace, it's, I don't know,
on WordPress, it's Php.

14
00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.480
You can use their language and
actually build a site.

15
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.025
A headless CMS is just half of that.

16
00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:55.050
It's just saying, all right,
we'll let you manage your content and

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.392
we'll deliver it over an API.

18
00:00:56.392 --> 00:00:58.377
So that's the best way I can describe it.

19
00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:02.215
So why headless CMS is a thing
now when it's only half

20
00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:04.754
of what most CMS have always been.

21
00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:12.057
Well, I think it initially started
because around some time in the 2018s,

22
00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:19.695
JavaScript or Google was easily able to
index JavaScript based websites, right?

23
00:01:19.695 --> 00:01:22.971
Before that,
you have people remember this, but

24
00:01:22.971 --> 00:01:27.968
if you had like a single page app, you
had to use a service like pre render to.

25
00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:32.588
If you detected a Google bot crawling your
website, you send them back a pre rendered

26
00:01:32.588 --> 00:01:36.558
version of that website that you use
the service to actually pre render,

27
00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:40.726
because it really wasn't good at
indexing JavaScript based websites, but

28
00:01:40.726 --> 00:01:42.381
at some point it did get good.

29
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:45.143
And it was, yeah, we don't care if
you have JavaScript, we'll run that.

30
00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:46.416
And then that was the change.

31
00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.264
That's when people were, well,

32
00:01:48.264 --> 00:01:51.633
we can finally build SEO-friendly
static websites with JavaScript.

33
00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:52.986
Let's just do that.

34
00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:56.094
And you went from having
these server side or

35
00:01:56.094 --> 00:01:59.718
these template languages
like handlebars or EJS.

36
00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:02.503
To like, CS, whatever thing
you want on the front end, and

37
00:02:02.503 --> 00:02:04.023
that's totally fine, right?

38
00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:06.333
So I think that's what happened and

39
00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:11.107
that became a better experience to
build static SEO friendly websites and

40
00:02:11.107 --> 00:02:16.037
whatever proprietary or outdated
technologies that you had to use before.

41
00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:21.046
So now that people are building websites
and their favorite JavaScript framework,

42
00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:24.926
and there's more frameworks to
be released every single day, so

43
00:02:24.926 --> 00:02:26.636
the love is getting bigger.

44
00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:28.265
How do you manage your content?

45
00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:31.130
You still have people on your
team who aren't technical.

46
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.637
You still have people on your team
that need to run experiments and

47
00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:36.182
manage some of the content.

48
00:02:36.182 --> 00:02:38.922
And you also still don't wanna do it.

49
00:02:38.922 --> 00:02:41.051
So how does that work?

50
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.179
So that's where headless
CMS has come from, right?

51
00:02:43.179 --> 00:02:44.478
They came from that need and

52
00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:47.315
at least that's kind of where I
saw it are in the early days.

53
00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:48.352
And since then,

54
00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:53.103
they've evolved, they're now moving
back towards traditional health.

55
00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:56.878
Traditional CMS is where you can download
or build a whole site and a headless CMS,

56
00:02:56.878 --> 00:03:00.235
and we'll actually do some of that
you'll see what I'm talking about.

57
00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:02.947
Look at this point where it kind of
feels like you're just making a site,

58
00:03:02.947 --> 00:03:03.885
which can be good or bad.

59
00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:08.406
It really just depends on your
relationship with the non-technical people

60
00:03:08.406 --> 00:03:11.455
on your team and
how much power you've given them.

61
00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:16.955
There's a dynamic with headless CMSs on
who has the most power, who can do things.

62
00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:18.958
Do you want them to be able,
is this dynamic?

63
00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.490
Is this not dynamic?

64
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.587
You can let someone change the theme on
the website if you want through a CMS or

65
00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:27.586
the colors, but should you?

66
00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:28.366
I don't know, right?

67
00:03:28.366 --> 00:03:32.397
So it really just depends on
how much power you give them.

68
00:03:32.397 --> 00:03:35.131
Let's talk about some of the headless
CMSs out there and the different types.

69
00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:40.032
And then which one we're gonna
be using and why I chose it.

70
00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:44.877
So there's two types of headless CMS
is although like a third type is

71
00:03:44.877 --> 00:03:48.458
like emerging and
we'll kind of talk about that.

72
00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.324
There's got to be like the open source and
the closed source basically, right?

73
00:03:51.324 --> 00:03:58.913
So the open source ones you have things
like the sanity IEOs of the world.

74
00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:04.077
The way these work, there's this
weird problem that most headless

75
00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:09.243
CMS companies have to figure out is
like who are we marketing towards

76
00:04:09.243 --> 00:04:14.066
to because a headless CMS cannot
be used by just a content team.

77
00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:18.035
It's a product that has to be integrated
by engineers, but the engineers aren't

78
00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:21.847
the ones typically editing the content,
but they have to do the integration.

79
00:04:21.847 --> 00:04:24.833
So it's like this chicken or
the egg problem of like, all right,

80
00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:28.637
are we marketing to developers so they can
integrate or are you marketing to content

81
00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:31.162
people so they can ask their
developers to integrate?

82
00:04:31.162 --> 00:04:35.486
So on a lot of headless CMS websites,
you'll see things like for

83
00:04:35.486 --> 00:04:40.454
developers, click here for marketers,
click here for product people,

84
00:04:40.454 --> 00:04:43.679
click here, right, and
I do things like that.

85
00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:47.912
Because it's used by a lot of people.

86
00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:51.643
These open source headless CMS is
are kind of just double down on developer

87
00:04:51.643 --> 00:04:52.798
experience, right?

88
00:04:52.798 --> 00:04:55.845
They're just like if we make
the best developer experience,

89
00:04:55.845 --> 00:04:58.670
developers won't feel like
it's a chore to set this up.

90
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.150
And therefore they're not
technical folks and their team,

91
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.260
we'll get really good value a lot faster,
so that's the whole point of like

92
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.341
the open source headless CMS is that's
the approach that they're doing.

93
00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:11.592
Sanity's probably one of the leading
open source headless CMS out there

94
00:05:11.592 --> 00:05:16.202
in my opinion I don't know if it's
the best, I haven't used it in like years.

95
00:05:16.202 --> 00:05:19.978
I'm actually not a fan of their UI, I just
cannot get over how basic that UI is.

96
00:05:19.978 --> 00:05:22.147
But, it works.

97
00:05:22.147 --> 00:05:24.138
But yeah, this one's open source.

98
00:05:24.138 --> 00:05:28.779
You would have to download Saturday on
your computer, run it just like a regular

99
00:05:28.779 --> 00:05:33.157
app and then you talk to it and then you
gotta host it and do things like that.

100
00:05:33.157 --> 00:05:35.371
We're not gonna do that today,

101
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:39.309
although I do think the developer
experience is better.

102
00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:40.855
It's just a lot more work.

103
00:05:40.855 --> 00:05:45.040
So I don't wanna have to host that and
then deploy our app and do all this stuff.

104
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.315
But if you want like a superior developer
experience where you can reuse components

105
00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:55.134
from your app and also in your headless
CMS, so your non-technical folks or

106
00:05:55.134 --> 00:05:59.158
your content creators can actually
use those components too.

107
00:05:59.158 --> 00:06:01.843
You probably want something open source.

108
00:06:01.843 --> 00:06:03.555
Here's another one.

109
00:06:03.555 --> 00:06:05.551
I see.

110
00:06:05.551 --> 00:06:06.566
I forgot what it's called.

111
00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:11.916
Let me see typescripts headless CMS,
payload.

112
00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:12.714
It's called payload.

113
00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:15.741
This was relatively new but
I kind of like what they're doing.

114
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:17.457
Payloads also open source one.

115
00:06:17.457 --> 00:06:21.624
They work very well with a lot
of the frameworks is out there,

116
00:06:21.624 --> 00:06:26.215
they have a good aesthetic if you like,
design is your sweet spot.

117
00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:30.407
So this is also a really good one but
I would say the leading open source one

118
00:06:30.407 --> 00:06:34.672
iIthink is probably still strappy maybe,
although at this point I cannot

119
00:06:34.672 --> 00:06:37.520
confidently say that
it's just a headless CMS.

120
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.378
At this point it's a back-end as
a service literally does everything,

121
00:06:41.378 --> 00:06:44.362
it's not just a CMS, but
because it can do everything.

122
00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:46.639
You can use it as a CMS.

123
00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.102
To me it's like an overkill.

124
00:06:49.102 --> 00:06:51.365
It's like shooting a roach with a bazooka.

125
00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:54.143
It's just more than you'll
ever need at this point.

126
00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:57.763
But it works really good and
people speak very highly of it.

127
00:06:57.763 --> 00:07:02.179
I haven't used it since they first came
out in early 2015 even before then, so

128
00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.083
I can't tell you how it is now I just
heard really good things about it, so

129
00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:09.158
I think they're still like
the leading open source one.

130
00:07:09.158 --> 00:07:12.400
Again, these open source ones
focus on developer experience.

131
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.141
I think strappy also put a really good
emphasis on user experience as far as

132
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:21.360
the UI, so there's a great content
editing experience as well.

133
00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.759
So whereas a lot of the open source ones
don't really have an editing experience,

134
00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.821
catered towards non technical people,
they're like,

135
00:07:28.821 --> 00:07:30.750
still catered toward developers.

136
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.695
So it's like, who's really making
the content here, the developers or

137
00:07:34.695 --> 00:07:36.103
the non technical folks.

138
00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:37.575
So we got that.

139
00:07:37.575 --> 00:07:41.788
So those are open source, closed source.

140
00:07:41.788 --> 00:07:43.823
There are so many of them.

141
00:07:43.823 --> 00:07:46.755
There's like a new one every single day.

142
00:07:46.755 --> 00:07:50.063
I don't really have any opinions
on like which one's the best or

143
00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:51.969
if this one's better than that one.

144
00:07:51.969 --> 00:07:54.784
I've just, the ones that I've tried
are the ones that I've used over time.

145
00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:57.039
So I'll just talk about some of them.

146
00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:00.036
I think the OG OG one is contentful.

147
00:08:00.036 --> 00:08:03.402
That's probably one of the first
headless CMSs out there.

148
00:08:03.402 --> 00:08:06.798
Well, other than like the enterprise
ones that have been doing it for

149
00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:08.684
way much longer than contentful has.

150
00:08:08.684 --> 00:08:10.702
This one's pretty cool, I guess.

151
00:08:10.702 --> 00:08:14.244
It's like the McDonald's of headless CMS.

152
00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:17.264
So, it's just everywhere.

153
00:08:17.264 --> 00:08:21.670
But if you want something,
you're not gonna go there to get Wagyu.

154
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.939
So [LAUGH] it's pretty good, I guess.

155
00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:28.627
I've used it many times, very simple.

156
00:08:28.627 --> 00:08:30.704
I think they simplified it a lot, but

157
00:08:30.704 --> 00:08:33.723
they definitely cater
towards more enterprise now.

158
00:08:33.723 --> 00:08:37.873
And as you can see, a lot of CMSs
are starting to talk about AI, this, and

159
00:08:37.873 --> 00:08:42.368
AI that, which is very interesting because
I do think CMSs have a great surface

160
00:08:42.368 --> 00:08:46.143
in which you can apply AI to, so
you can do some really cool stuff.

161
00:08:46.143 --> 00:08:48.478
So I think it's a great app.

162
00:08:48.478 --> 00:08:51.929
I haven't tried any of the AI features,
but I bet they're pretty cool.

163
00:08:51.929 --> 00:08:56.000
So I would say Contentful
is probably a good one.

164
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.053
I mean, I could talk, about other ones,
there's so many of ' out there.

165
00:08:59.053 --> 00:09:04.615
You have Prismic, you have butter CMS,
you have Sitecore, you have,

166
00:09:04.615 --> 00:09:11.030
there's a lot, there's so many of them
out there I can't even Adobe has one too.

167
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.426
It's like Adobe Experience Manager.

168
00:09:14.426 --> 00:09:15.893
There's a lot of them, so

169
00:09:15.893 --> 00:09:19.910
it's overwhelming when it comes to
deciding which one you wanna pick.

170
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.607
Now when it comes to which one we're
gonna pick, we're gonna pick it sinful.

171
00:09:22.607 --> 00:09:26.542
The reason I pick in sinful is really
just three reasons one, it's free,

172
00:09:26.542 --> 00:09:30.682
a lot of them are free, but this one is
free and it's been free for a long time.

173
00:09:30.682 --> 00:09:35.403
Two, out of all the ones that I've
had experience with this is the one I

174
00:09:35.403 --> 00:09:40.141
have the most experience with so
I feel more comfortable teaching it.

175
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:44.237
And then three, because they actually
don't support the latest version of

176
00:09:44.237 --> 00:09:48.205
Next.js, it actually works out for
us because we get to build like our own

177
00:09:48.205 --> 00:09:52.689
custom integration from scratch, which
means we can do whatever the hell we want.

178
00:09:52.689 --> 00:09:56.884
Whereas all the other ones either support
it, they support the latest version of

179
00:09:56.884 --> 00:10:01.280
Next.js, but they abstracted away so much
that you were not gonna learn anything.

180
00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:04.152
So I was like, I don't really want
to do that, because you're not,

181
00:10:04.152 --> 00:10:05.762
really gonna know what's going on here.

182
00:10:05.762 --> 00:10:08.965
You're not gonna know that, this is
how you turn on previews and Next.js,

183
00:10:08.965 --> 00:10:10.330
because it's doing it for you.

184
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.418
And I think it's just too specific.

185
00:10:12.418 --> 00:10:16.770
I wanted something that was literally
just an HTTP call and that was it.

186
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.911
So that way we are not bound to this
is how you do this in contentful and

187
00:10:20.911 --> 00:10:22.155
it only works here.

188
00:10:22.155 --> 00:10:25.919
So I wanted it to be extremely generic,
and it doesn't get more generic than this.

189
00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:28.894
Like I said,
it's the McDonald's of headless CMSs.

190
00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:32.652
So that's why it shows them, but
I wouldn't say that they're the best.

191
00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:35.949
There's definitely a lot of better
products out there in my opinion.

192
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:37.677
So we're gonna be doing that.

193
00:10:37.677 --> 00:10:41.069
So with that being said,
go to contemplate.com, sign up,

194
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:43.335
you can create an account, it's free.

195
00:10:43.335 --> 00:10:45.640
I'm I already have one,
so I'm gonna log in.

196
00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.486
Once you create an account,
they're gonna have you go through and

197
00:10:49.486 --> 00:10:51.349
make something called spaces.

198
00:10:51.349 --> 00:10:56.847
You can roughly associate
spaces with websites, I guess.

199
00:10:56.847 --> 00:11:00.445
A space is like a website or
you can think of it as a database.

200
00:11:00.445 --> 00:11:01.460
This is a database.

201
00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.866
This is a website.

202
00:11:02.866 --> 00:11:06.032
This is a project,
however you wanna correlate that.

203
00:11:06.032 --> 00:11:08.124
But just make a space.

204
00:11:08.124 --> 00:11:09.313
I have a space here.

205
00:11:09.313 --> 00:11:10.453
Mine already has content in it.

206
00:11:10.453 --> 00:11:13.684
I'm most likely gonna delete it all so
we can do it from scratch together.

207
00:11:13.684 --> 00:11:17.163
But, yeah, make a space.

208
00:11:17.163 --> 00:11:20.701
I don't really need to walk you through
all this stuff, because we're gonna do it

209
00:11:20.701 --> 00:11:24.102
together when we start modeling content,
and it's honestly really simple.

210
00:11:24.102 --> 00:11:27.191
It's a UI for a database.

211
00:11:27.191 --> 00:11:31.080
At the end of the day,
a CMS is a UI for a database.

212
00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.094
It's a form builder for a database,

213
00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:39.160
the only caveat is everybody
has a different schema, right?

214
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.568
It's like you allow someone
to model a schema and

215
00:11:41.568 --> 00:11:43.279
all their schemas are different.

216
00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:46.728
So that's where it starts to get pretty
difficult as far as on the implementation

217
00:11:46.728 --> 00:11:48.516
side, if you're making a headless CMS.

218
00:11:48.516 --> 00:11:54.850
But at the end of the day,
it's a UI for a database, so.

219
00:11:54.850 --> 00:12:00.085
Is contentful for you for
commercial purposes, or?

220
00:12:00.085 --> 00:12:05.706
Yes, contentful is free for no matter what
you do with it up to a certain limit.

221
00:12:05.706 --> 00:12:07.932
I mean, you could look at their pricing.

222
00:12:07.932 --> 00:12:08.852
Let's go look at it.

223
00:12:08.852 --> 00:12:10.415
Let's go see.

224
00:12:10.415 --> 00:12:17.544
I'll make sure, I am accurate with that.

225
00:12:17.544 --> 00:12:20.338
Looks like they have a free forever for
developers and

226
00:12:20.338 --> 00:12:22.646
marketers building individual projects.

227
00:12:22.646 --> 00:12:26.351
So yeah, looks like you can
do whatever you want with it.

228
00:12:26.351 --> 00:12:30.018
You have the same license.

229
00:12:30.018 --> 00:12:33.763
You're just limited in capacity and
users and things like that.

230
00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:38.828
But for our purpose,
we won't even approach these limits,

231
00:12:38.828 --> 00:12:40.726
when building today.

232
00:12:40.726 --> 00:12:45.193
So not a big deal, but as you can
tell they are focused on enterprise,

233
00:12:45.193 --> 00:12:46.895
it goes from here to here.

234
00:12:46.895 --> 00:12:49.485
It's a call us real quick.

235
00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:51.909
[LAUGH] Escalated really quick.

236
00:12:51.909 --> 00:12:53.807
So they mostly just focused on enterprise,
so

237
00:12:53.807 --> 00:12:55.666
they don't really care about this, right?

238
00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:57.615
So it's not really bothering them.
