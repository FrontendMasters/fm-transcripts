00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.110
First of all, let's move this
everything out of a script tag here.

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.469
This should feel gross to that you're
writing JavaScript in your HTML.

3
00:00:07.469 --> 00:00:11.482
I just wanted to give you
the hello world of this.

4
00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:14.630
But now we're gonna move it
into a file called app.js.

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.670
So create a new file here.

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.113
Inside of your source
directory called App.js.

7
00:00:23.951 --> 00:00:29.059
Okay, once inside of App.js,
we're gonna create, and

8
00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:34.388
then we're just gonna copy and
paste all of this over there.

9
00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:40.626
Okay.

10
00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:45.770
And then we're also gonna have this
source equals app.js, like that.

11
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.091
That will paste all that in here.

12
00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:56.534
Okay.

13
00:00:56.534 --> 00:00:57.921
The next thing we're do is we're
gonna create another component.

14
00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:02.785
So we're going to say const pet equals

15
00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:07.649
another array of function, return,

16
00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.754
react.create element, div.

17
00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:15.864
Empty object.

18
00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:25.148
And then here we're gonna give it
an array of components to render.

19
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.211
Right?
So, basically what you're saying is like I

20
00:01:32.211 --> 00:01:36.200
have a div and then in that div,
I'm gonna have three other elements.

21
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.380
All right, this is how you do that.

22
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.241
You can do that with an array.

23
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:46.185
React.create element h1 and

24
00:01:46.185 --> 00:01:49.416
instead of the h1,

25
00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:54.180
we're going to put luminor.

26
00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.949
Actually, let's do it this way we're
going to put we actually make that an h2.

27
00:02:00.949 --> 00:02:03.436
We're gonna make three of these.

28
00:02:03.436 --> 00:02:05.353
h3, h3.

29
00:02:05.353 --> 00:02:12.865
Luna is a dog, and she is havanese,
which is the name of the breed of my dog.

30
00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:13.989
So we're gonna be talking about my dog.

31
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.251
Feel free to put in the name of
your pet if you so desire though.

32
00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.662
Okay, so
now I've created this pet component,

33
00:02:24.662 --> 00:02:29.270
this pet stamp that whenever I stamp it
somewhere it's gonna create all of this.

34
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.767
Okay here inside of my react,
create element.

35
00:02:38.115 --> 00:02:39.595
I'm going to put this in an array as well.

36
00:02:39.595 --> 00:02:46.580
Then here I'm gonna say react.

37
00:02:51.824 --> 00:02:53.959
Reacts.create element.

38
00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.498
Pet like that just like we did down here.

39
00:03:01.498 --> 00:03:04.838
I'm gonna create three of them.

40
00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:13.003
That's something I should
mention is here as well.

41
00:03:13.003 --> 00:03:13.890
This array is actually
technically optional.

42
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.803
So I could delete this.

43
00:03:21.711 --> 00:03:23.850
So you just be giving it
multiple parameters and

44
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.619
react knows how to handle that as well.

45
00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:29.591
I don't, it's almost never useful to
know that, but now you know that.

46
00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:33.637
I'm gonna leave it like this,

47
00:03:33.637 --> 00:03:36.110
cuz this is technically how
react does it under the hook.

48
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.007
So that's what I would do.

49
00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:41.620
But now we're gonna have a div here.

50
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.190
And then inside of that we're
gonna have an h1 with adopt me.

51
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.390
And then we're going to have three stamps
of this pet component, which you see here.

52
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.623
With and that's going to have a div and
inside of that it's gonna have an h2 and

53
00:03:57.623 --> 00:03:58.540
h3, and an h3.

54
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.840
So the question that I want you
to answer to yourself right now.

55
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.295
How many h3s are about to
be outputted to the DOM?

56
00:04:10.313 --> 00:04:14.560
Six, six h3s will be output to the DOM,
right?

57
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.200
Because I have this pet component
which has two h3s inside of it and

58
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.830
I'm doing that three times.

59
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.630
So let's go see let's go check our math.

60
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.340
So I'm going to save this and
I'm going to refresh the page.

61
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:38.539
And you can see here
that's inspect element.

62
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.870
So you have luna the dog and
then you have dog and havanese.

63
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.030
Those are both h threes, right?

64
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.610
And you can see that I have six of those.

65
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.770
Starting to get more into why
react is useful now, right?

66
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.910
I made this pet component and
I was able to use it multiple times.

67
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.090
Again, you probably could have written
this HTML faster than the reactor that

68
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.660
we wrote.

69
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.413
But we're gonna start adding more and

70
00:05:04.413 --> 00:05:07.930
more layers to this where this is going
to become more and more useful to you.

71
00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.749
&gt;&gt; In the array, you have a comma and
the last element of the array.

72
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:13.160
How does that?.

73
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.808
Maybe it's something I'm not used to.

74
00:05:15.808 --> 00:05:19.879
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I have a comma here on
the last element of the array and

75
00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.755
when we get into prettier actually insert
these for you as of es 2018, 2017.

76
00:05:25.755 --> 00:05:29.750
So it's a relatively new
feature to Java Script.

77
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.930
You can always end arrays with commas.

78
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.710
You don't have to as well,
if I delete this it still works.

79
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.880
But the nice thing about this is.

80
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.330
Now I can do that and
I don't have to modify anything.

81
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.470
It's also not going to mess my get
blamed if I delete the last one, right?

82
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.160
That's the idea.

83
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.419
So he's asking, can we use like a 4 loop
or other kind of like control structures

84
00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:57.010
in JavaScript to generate components and
you absolutely can do that.

85
00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.350
And we'll be doing that
actually quite a bit.

86
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.300
We'll see how well this works.

87
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.269
You can see here I use the map which
is basically like the same as a for

88
00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:06.040
loop in some capacity, right?

89
00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.370
This is going to generate four
different react components.

90
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.389
Now if I save this and refresh over here.

91
00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:19.352
You can see here made a bunch of adoptees,
right because our h1,

92
00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:22.980
I guess if I just go and
make this an h2 refresh again.

93
00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:28.409
Yeah, you can see here,
I made a bunch of like 1,2,3 here.

94
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.378
We did this basically through a for
loop, but

95
00:06:33.378 --> 00:06:35.300
you couldn't you could absolutely
do this through a for loop as well.

96
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.259
I would have to take it
outside of the component.

97
00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:40.550
Not outside the component but
outside of the return.

98
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.310
&gt;&gt; Why do we need to create an additional
react.create element by using pattern app?

99
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.162
&gt;&gt; So let me make sure I
understand your question, preview.

100
00:06:50.162 --> 00:06:53.210
So react.createelement here, right?

101
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.270
So this is creating a div.

102
00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.463
So basically every time that you
create a new tag or you're creating

103
00:06:57.463 --> 00:07:00.860
a new instance of a component,
you have to use React.createElement.

104
00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.170
This is basically telling React,
I want a new instance of this.

105
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.870
So I want a new div,
I want a new h2 or I want a new pet.

106
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.386
&gt;&gt; You had just written that h2, right?

107
00:07:12.386 --> 00:07:15.668
We had three dots in the beginning, right?

108
00:07:15.668 --> 00:07:18.306
That was for de-structuring and
why was led?

109
00:07:18.306 --> 00:07:21.732
&gt;&gt; This is, you're talking about this.

110
00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:24.454
This is actually called
the spread operator so

111
00:07:24.454 --> 00:07:27.330
this is basically saying
I have this array here.

112
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.854
And I want to the array that
this is going to create,

113
00:07:29.854 --> 00:07:32.220
to be concatenated to
this array that it's in.

114
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:34.140
&gt;&gt; Okay.

115
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.640
Thank you.

116
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, do not worry about that.

117
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.845
That's totally like
tangential to this course.

118
00:07:41.845 --> 00:07:44.410
But it is kind of a cool
way of doing that.

119
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:48.465
In other words, this is not super
useful to know about react, right?

120
00:07:48.465 --> 00:07:50.065
This is just a fun JavaScript feature.

121
00:07:51.205 --> 00:07:52.455
Something to just call out here.

122
00:07:52.455 --> 00:07:54.848
If you look at your console,
you are going to get.

123
00:07:54.848 --> 00:07:59.712
Each list, each panelist
should have a unique key prop.

124
00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:01.680
Do not worry about that for the moment,
we will solve that momentarily.

125
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.530
You will probably see that error a lot.

126
00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.680
It's not a big deal, at the moment.

127
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.720
So, you can just ignore that for
right now.

128
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.894
The basic gist of it though, is that,

129
00:08:12.894 --> 00:08:15.250
I have three of these
components here in a row.

130
00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.970
Luna Dog Havanese.

131
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.312
And basically what react is saying like,
if you like swapped this one and this one,

132
00:08:23.312 --> 00:08:27.430
I would like to know that I'd like
to be able to keep track of that.

133
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.172
So that I can just swap the HTML,
MO instead of destroying them and

134
00:08:31.172 --> 00:08:32.270
recreating them.

135
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.190
So you have to give it a key prompt.

136
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.074
Is like, alright, here's a string
that's unique to each one of these so

137
00:08:38.074 --> 00:08:40.020
that you can track what order they're in.

138
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.520
And then swap them appropriately and or
create, and destroy them as necessary.

139
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.340
That's the gist.

140
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.680
But we'll see how to solve that later.
