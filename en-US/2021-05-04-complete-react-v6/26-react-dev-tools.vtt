00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.461
Lastly, let's dig into
the React Core Tools.

2
00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:08.439
So, the React Dev Tools rather.

3
00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:15.054
You'll notice here in my Firefox I have,
the React Tools here installed.

4
00:00:15.054 --> 00:00:18.957
You can even see that this page that
you're looking at right now actually uses

5
00:00:18.957 --> 00:00:19.988
React in of itself.

6
00:00:19.988 --> 00:00:24.033
You'll see here I have components and
profiler here at my dev tools.

7
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.654
Let's open Pro components.

8
00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.019
So this is actually a set of tools.

9
00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.863
It's a browser extension
that the React in provides.

10
00:00:34.863 --> 00:00:38.737
So you can just say react Dev Tools and
search for that on,

11
00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:44.012
I'm on DuckDuckGo but you can be on Google
or Bing or whatever you wanna be on.

12
00:00:44.012 --> 00:00:50.212
And the first couple ones will be, here
it is for Chrome, here it is for Edge.

13
00:00:50.212 --> 00:00:54.408
Firefox, so you can get it for Firefox.

14
00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:58.147
They used to have Safari,
I think Safari is unsupported now, so

15
00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:02.873
if you're on Safari temporarily, please
just take a look at Chrome or Firefox.

16
00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:08.533
It's good browser, but
that's just the choice they made.

17
00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:13.029
So open that, you can see that
there's two different things here.

18
00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:15.168
I use the components one all the time.

19
00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:18.489
So this is basically like a DOM Explorer,
but for

20
00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:21.089
React, so you can see here I have app.

21
00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:23.602
I have search Params, I have results.

22
00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:30.489
I have pets and it works just like dev
tools as well which is really great.

23
00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:34.707
Another great thing I can do is
I can right-click on Luna here,

24
00:01:34.707 --> 00:01:36.310
I can inspect element.

25
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.229
And then,
if I just click into to the Components,

26
00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.394
it'll actually select that for me.

27
00:01:41.394 --> 00:01:46.082
So it's smart enough to follow
that kind of thread there.

28
00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:50.706
I can see all the props that are going
into Luna, Havanese, images, location,

29
00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:52.076
all that kind of stuff.

30
00:01:52.076 --> 00:01:55.490
I can see its render
tree if I go in here and

31
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.637
now like Inspect Element on the Select
there and I go back to Components.

32
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.354
So that's inside of search params and

33
00:02:08.354 --> 00:02:11.150
I can actually modify
the state directly in there.

34
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.662
So let's modify this one.

35
00:02:14.662 --> 00:02:16.838
This should be animal.

36
00:02:16.838 --> 00:02:22.610
If I'd say dog, actually you notice
I modified it directly in there.

37
00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:29.822
Or if I modify this one and
I say Minneapolis,

38
00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:34.856
MN, and I hit Enter, so
I can actually modify

39
00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:39.248
the state directly in my application.

40
00:02:39.248 --> 00:02:41.741
This is useful for
some debugging purposes.

41
00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:47.712
I can see all the keys and
parameters that are going into there,

42
00:02:47.712 --> 00:02:49.580
all those kind of useful things.

43
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:50.299
The profiler,

44
00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.852
I'm not gonna get too much into it just
cuz I don't really know it very well.

45
00:02:53.852 --> 00:02:58.476
But if you're trying to find performance
problems, I can click the Record here,

46
00:02:58.476 --> 00:02:59.355
click around.

47
00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.505
And then I click Stop.

48
00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:09.703
I'll get a nice looking little flame graph
ranked interactions, blah, blah, blah.

49
00:03:09.703 --> 00:03:14.540
It'll give me a bunch of performance
data that I can actually go

50
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.563
profile problems with my components.

51
00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:21.586
This obviously wasn't very big because
it's not a very big application.

52
00:03:21.586 --> 00:03:24.961
But I mean,
you could run these on Netflix.com and

53
00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:29.840
see a pretty big application and
how it runs and its performance profile.

54
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.578
You won't get nice names
because they minify and

55
00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:37.185
all that kind of stuff that they're built,
and actually it might not work because

56
00:03:37.185 --> 00:03:40.741
they might not be able to instrument
with the production bill.

57
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.342
Definitely check, it used to work,
it might not work anymore.

58
00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:47.875
Anyway, those are the dev tools.

59
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.502
Be sure to use those, they are gonna be
extremely useful not only today, but for

60
00:03:51.502 --> 00:03:54.770
every react developer ever,
it's an essential part of your toolbox.
