00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.332
Let's add to our ESLint config now.

2
00:00:06.332 --> 00:00:11.812
So I want you to come in here and
we're gonna

3
00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:18.370
do npm install -D
ESLint-plugin-react-hooks

4
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:24.912
@4.2.0.

5
00:00:29.556 --> 00:00:34.040
So this is another set of rules that
specifically applies to react hooks.

6
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.180
It's put out by the react team.

7
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.420
It's like their best practices.

8
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.376
The one thing that it depends on.

9
00:00:39.376 --> 00:00:44.103
So I'm gonna show you how to make custom
hooks here in just a second that you use

10
00:00:44.103 --> 00:00:45.506
blank naming schema.

11
00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:49.484
Cuz that's what it's checking for
is, if it has use blank,

12
00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:51.357
then it thinks it's a hook.

13
00:00:51.357 --> 00:00:53.750
And if it doesn't have that,
it doesn't think it's a hook.

14
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.128
So that's why we use
that use nomenclature.

15
00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:05.970
Okay, we did that now let's
go back to ESLint config,

16
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.443
eslinterc.json and here inside of,

17
00:01:10.443 --> 00:01:15.595
basically any order before prettier.

18
00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:16.905
Prettier has to be the last one.

19
00:01:16.905 --> 00:01:19.778
So I'll just put it under here.

20
00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:28.197
Plugin: react-hooks/recommended.

21
00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:32.768
And that's it.

22
00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:36.703
So this add like another layer of checking
just to make sure that we don't have bugs

23
00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:39.726
with hooks, cuz they do have some
peculiar behavior habits and

24
00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:40.940
I'll show some of them.

25
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.678
So now if we go back over
to our SearchParams and

26
00:01:47.678 --> 00:01:54.195
we do exactly what I just told
you not to do which if true,

27
00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:57.957
1 + 1 doubles or triple = 2.

28
00:01:57.957 --> 00:02:01.230
So this is gonna tell me that
unexpected constant condition.

29
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.723
Well, I mean,
that's good that it detects that but,

30
00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:14.130
if that then const
something I'll say animal.

31
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.650
And setAnimal, = useState(dog).

32
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.245
I'm gonna get an error here
saying right this one useState is

33
00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:35.070
called conditionally, this one,
this little right here.

34
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.560
And there's a rule called rule of hooks.

35
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.950
This is gonna prevent you
from doing stuff like this.

36
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.188
And same thing here,

37
00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:50.135
if I try to do for let i

38
00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:55.381
= 0, i &lt; 3 i + +,

39
00:02:58.279 --> 00:03:01.110
Oops, it's gonna get upset at me again.

40
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.570
Saying like, hey,
you can't do that inside of there.

41
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.974
So actually let's do something
kind of fun just to show you.

42
00:03:10.974 --> 00:03:18.101
Math.floor, math.random,

43
00:03:20.773 --> 00:03:27.451
Times, 3.

44
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:27.951
Yeah.

45
00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:31.660
And then we're gonna put
location underneath here.

46
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.301
So what's actually gonna happen here is
because I'm calling these hooks randomly,

47
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:45.130
it's gonna really mess with what's
in here in this particular useState.

48
00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.900
So I have to run my server again.

49
00:03:52.883 --> 00:03:55.377
You don't have to do this by the way,

50
00:03:55.377 --> 00:03:59.734
I'm just showing you how messed
up this can get really quickly.

51
00:03:59.734 --> 00:04:01.352
[LAUGH] Did it just break?

52
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.142
It actually just throws an error is like,

53
00:04:06.142 --> 00:04:09.643
hey, you have less hooks than you
did last time, what's going on?

54
00:04:09.643 --> 00:04:12.354
I give up.

55
00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:14.613
Please figure out your stuff and
come back.

56
00:04:14.613 --> 00:04:17.030
So that's good on react,
I actually didn't know it would do that.

57
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.044
What I would have expected to see is
that it would sometimes show dogs,

58
00:04:20.044 --> 00:04:22.192
sometimes shows Seattle,
sometimes show dog and

59
00:04:22.192 --> 00:04:24.150
it would just not know
what to do with itself.

60
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.415
But in this case, it just says, no, I'm
not gonna to fix this you have to first.

61
00:04:31.415 --> 00:04:33.090
It's nice that they do this
that really helps you.

62
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.566
You kind of get into the habit really
quickly of never putting things inside of

63
00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:39.030
if statements or for loops with hooks.

64
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.299
Normally all of your hooks are just
gonna be right here at the very,

65
00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:43.460
very top of your component and
then you use them underneath it.
