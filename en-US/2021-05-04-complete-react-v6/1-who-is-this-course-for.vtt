1
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.410
So who is this course for?

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.140
Hoping it's for you, right?

3
00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.604
I tried to build this course for

4
00:00:06.604 --> 00:00:09.942
anyone that wants to learn react that
they can come in and pick this up.

5
00:00:09.942 --> 00:00:12.502
So it's for beginners in JavaScript.

6
00:00:12.502 --> 00:00:16.810
It's for, I've been working as
a career engineer for a decade.

7
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.459
The key here that I want you to understand
at least a little bit of JavaScript.

8
00:00:21.459 --> 00:00:23.090
Because I'm not gonna be
teaching you JavaScript.

9
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.113
And if you do need to
understand JavaScript,

10
00:00:25.113 --> 00:00:27.520
there's lots of great
courses on front end masters.

11
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.504
I like to do some help there like the boot
camp is a good place you can go or

12
00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:34.039
intro to web dev v2.

13
00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:37.070
Lots of good courses for
you to take for that.

14
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.726
So if this is your first time in React,
or sorry, in JavaScript,

15
00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:43.920
this should be the third or
fourth course you might take.

16
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
If you have taken previous versions
of this course, this is updated.

17
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.623
This is with all the latest
greatest hotness.

18
00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:56.063
So this is still useful to take in
particular that I go over some new

19
00:00:56.063 --> 00:01:00.525
techniques, some updated tooling,
all those kinds of things.

20
00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:04.495
This course will feature all
the current feature set of the library.

21
00:01:04.495 --> 00:01:07.725
By the time that you're done with this,
you'll have learned almost all of the API.

22
00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:09.905
So that's all goodness as well.

23
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.260
This course does show so
much the same structure as V5.

24
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.480
So if you've done V5,
this will feel very familiar.

25
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.710
But again, some updated gray content and
a lot of it's been rewritten.

26
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.040
So it is, I think,
still worthwhile for you to check out.

27
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.969
I built this course because I was really
frustrated with a lot of the courses

28
00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.740
out there that they didn't
start from ground zero.

29
00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.062
So when I dig into something I new,
I don't like magic.

30
00:01:33.062 --> 00:01:38.050
I wanna understand how everything
works and in particular the tools.

31
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.847
This is why I don't start with
Create React App, which is a great tool.

32
00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:44.160
I love Create React App,
I use it all the time.

33
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.691
But I don't have you start with that
because I want you to understand the tools

34
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.010
that go to create React App.

35
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.236
Create React App does a lot for
you, right?

36
00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:56.220
It's Setup, the build process,
it adds linting.

37
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.280
It adds service workers.

38
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.336
And I wanna strip all that away.

39
00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:03.098
And I want you and
I to start from a repo, from zero.

40
00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:04.810
So that you and
I can learn React together.

41
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.361
So that's why I wrote
this course this way.

42
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.890
It's why we're not using Create React App.

43
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.773
I think afterwards, you should use Create
React App once you use everything because

44
00:02:12.773 --> 00:02:14.590
it does set up a good process for you.

45
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.088
But I want you to understand how
to set this up for yourself.

46
00:02:17.088 --> 00:02:20.270
And why I use all the tools that I use.

47
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.250
So let's even talk about
like what React is, right?

48
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.870
What is React?

49
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.740
Why would I even wanna
learn this React thing?

50
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.452
Well, it's a library written for Facebook.

51
00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:32.076
I think it actually started out of
Instagram if I'm not correct, or

52
00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:33.740
if I'm not wrong.

53
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.410
It's a library for the view layer.

54
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.498
So when I say the view layer,
is not gonna handle like your models.

55
00:02:41.498 --> 00:02:43.070
It's not going to do anything like that.

56
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.456
It's a pretty unopinionated
the toolset for

57
00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:47.599
you to create User Interfaces out of it.

58
00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.782
But now, you can kind of argue with me
it doesn't do models like does state.

59
00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:54.740
But well, we'll get into that
when we get into the course.

60
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.623
But let's just talk about
like the fundamental model of

61
00:02:57.623 --> 00:02:59.290
how a React Application works.

62
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.758
So React Application is fundamentally
just a component which is made up

63
00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:04.041
out of other components.

64
00:03:04.041 --> 00:03:08.040
Which is made up of other components and
so on and so forth, to great depth.

65
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.580
If you could go through Facebook's
homepage, there's levels of depth.

66
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.800
They have a 100 components deep, right?

67
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.830
So it actually, it's a lot of
components making up other components.

68
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.312
So there's other frameworks out there.

69
00:03:23.312 --> 00:03:27.450
There's like angular might be one of them,
amber could definitely be one of them.

70
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.637
That what they try and do is, they try and
separate the models, the views, and

71
00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:33.801
the view models in two separate pieces.

72
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:37.722
So they try and separate these into,
like basically MVC.

73
00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:41.265
If you've never heard of MVC,
it stands for model view controller.

74
00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:44.953
And it's a really popular paradigm for
the back end of things like Ruby for

75
00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:48.780
things like Django, even you can do it
with Express if you really wanted to.

76
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.285
And that's a really great paradigm for

77
00:03:52.285 --> 00:03:55.640
the backend to separate these kind of
concerns into separate kind of silos.

78
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.720
So you can say like, all right,

79
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.685
if there's problems with my
database layer, I can know.

80
00:03:58.685 --> 00:04:00.970
I can go look at my models, right?

81
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.730
Or if my API is not responding correctly,
I can go look at my views.

82
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.970
So someone took that as like,
this is a great idea.

83
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.900
Let's take this and
apply it to the front end.

84
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.610
And more or less,
that's kind of how we got backbone.

85
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.230
If you remember backbone and I imagine
some of you probably still write backbone.

86
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.066
It's a fine library even still.

87
00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:20.770
React kind of took this and
totally flipped on its head,

88
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:23.700
like this is a great paradigm for
the back end.

89
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.040
But let's not do this for the front end.

90
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.750
This is actually kind of makes front end
harder because it's a weird abstraction.

91
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.291
When you're talking to
databases to have models,

92
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.550
everything in the front end is
based around components, right?

93
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.398
I have an HTML tag or a yeah.

94
00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:41.686
Which is filled with a body tag, which
is filled with dibs and sections, and

95
00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:43.102
images and paragraphs.

96
00:04:43.102 --> 00:04:48.391
And why don't we embrace that model and
take everything.

97
00:04:48.391 --> 00:04:51.191
The model the view, the controller, the
view model, whatever you wanna call it.

98
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:54.220
And shove it together for
one individual little component.

99
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.720
This ends up working out really well.

100
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.496
But it feels kind of
gross to people up front.

101
00:04:59.496 --> 00:05:03.170
Like, well, I was used to separating this
and I've always felt this was a good idea.

102
00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.010
So I'm gonna invite you to kind
of challenge that a little bit.

103
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.544
Work with me, with this, and then see at
the end that I think it's really good.

104
00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:13.188
The reason why I like this is because
when you go into like a component.

105
00:05:13.188 --> 00:05:16.000
Like let's take, like you have
a counter on the page, right?

106
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.730
And also on the counter
starts counting wrong.

107
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.669
Well, if you're in a different framework,
you can say like,

108
00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.325
is that the directive that's wrong?

109
00:05:23.325 --> 00:05:25.060
Is that the view model that's wrong?

110
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.330
Is that the controller is that the scope?

111
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.740
I'm referring to angular here just
because that's the one I know.

112
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.610
And I'm not picking on angular
great library as well.

113
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.945
The downside of that approach is
it's really hard to separate out.

114
00:05:36.945 --> 00:05:39.130
Where's that bug coming from?

115
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.100
Let's flip over to React now.

116
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.102
If there's a bug with the counter
component, It's in the counter component.

117
00:05:47.102 --> 00:05:51.417
In a depth of, the way that you structure
your application with React doesn't allow

118
00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:52.890
you to put it anywhere else.

119
00:05:53.920 --> 00:06:00.030
And so that reason is why I quite React,
It's a very readable library.

120
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.100
It's a very debuggable Library.

121
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.041
It's a tool that I feel like
assist you in maintaining it.

122
00:06:06.041 --> 00:06:09.970
And that's always the hardest part of
writing software is maintaining software

123
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.306
long term and fixing bugs.

124
00:06:11.306 --> 00:06:14.200
And debuggability and readability,
and all those kinds of things.

125
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.330
So, I'm excited to teach
you all this stuff.

126
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.288
This is something I really enjoy.

127
00:06:19.288 --> 00:06:20.570
So hopefully this course is for you.
