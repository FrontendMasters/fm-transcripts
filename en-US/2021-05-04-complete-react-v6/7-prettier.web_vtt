1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.450
Code quality it's really important to me.

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.600
I've worked in developer
infrastructure for like,

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.330
I don't like six or
seven years now my career.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.203
So my goal as a developer infrastructure
person has to make sure that

5
00:00:14.203 --> 00:00:18.400
people write quality code and
it doesn't slow them down.

6
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.869
So I'm really big in the tools that
helped me write better code faster.

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.121
So I'm gonna introduce you to my two ones
that I literally just can't live without,

8
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:28.377
like I teach you these things.

9
00:00:28.377 --> 00:00:31.519
Because if I didn't teach you these
things and set them up in your projects,

10
00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.990
I would have a hard time coding
the rest of the workshop.

11
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.460
So I'm just gonna drag you all
along with me and my developer.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.986
Productivity diatribe here.

13
00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:45.803
So the two tools we're gonna talk about
today are prettier and eslint, and

14
00:00:45.803 --> 00:00:50.611
they're just two tools that kinda help me
use kinda stay on the straight and narrow.

15
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:55.220
And allows me to stop thinking about
things about what's the spacing here?

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.580
Do I have enough tabs or spaces?

17
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.149
Do I need a semicolon here,

18
00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.570
it just takes care of all that
stuff automatically for you.

19
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.180
And the first one here is prettier.

20
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.640
So prettier is a automatic code formatter.

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.870
So if you've ever worked with like,
go or Elm, or reason or camel or

22
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.340
some of those things that have
built in code formatters.

23
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.116
This is basically that for the JavaScript
ecosystem that it just automatically,

24
00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:25.764
every time you save your file,
it just re adjusts all the spacing and

25
00:01:25.764 --> 00:01:28.290
commas and all that kind of stuff for you.

26
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.180
I love it because it allows me to shut
down the part of my brain that cares about

27
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.580
code formatting, right?

28
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.230
Like I remember earlier in my career
when I was writing like PHP and

29
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.459
stuff like that I'd be happy, like,
meticulously paying attention is like,

30
00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:39.730
do I have the right semi colon?

31
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.320
Is this indented correctly,

32
00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.290
all this kind of like just mechanical
syntactical kind of things.

33
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.897
This allows me to just shut off
that thread in my brain and

34
00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:49.960
freeze it up to think
about something else.

35
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.670
And that's why I just
adore this as a tool.

36
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.900
It's very opinionated.

37
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.887
As in like it's going to make you
if you want it to do four tabs or

38
00:01:58.887 --> 00:02:01.200
four spaces instead of two spaces.

39
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.240
It's just it doesn't care
about your feelings, right?.

40
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.158
It just does whatever it's gonna do.

41
00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:08.930
And that's really bothers some people.

42
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.778
They think that they have beautiful
art and their codes formatting and

43
00:02:11.778 --> 00:02:12.840
they're wrong.

44
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.610
[LAUGH] Cuz I don't care about what
kind of code formatting you have.

45
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.710
I just want it to be done for me.

46
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.530
I don't wanna never argue
about it ever again.

47
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.400
So let's go ahead and do that.

48
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.990
What I want you to do now, is I want you
to pop back into your command line here.

49
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.729
Again, here in the adopted me directory,
and I want you to do npm install -D,

50
00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:43.030
-D means that it's a dev dependency,
right?

51
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.910
I don't need to ship
prettier to production.

52
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.210
It's just to help me write code locally.

53
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:48.621
And it's called prettier.

54
00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.322
Okay, you can see now that I
have a node modules directory,

55
00:02:56.322 --> 00:02:58.020
that's where prettier was installed.

56
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.108
You can see it's right there.

57
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.870
And I also have a package lock file.

58
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.540
You should check in your
package lock file, but

59
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.780
you should never modify it by hand.

60
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.740
It's basically like a lock files like
here's the exact versions that I used to

61
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.000
install and get this running locally, so
that when you ship this out to production,

62
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.442
it uses the exact same ones.

63
00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:31.040
&gt;&gt; If you have it as an extension on VS
code, do you still need to download it?

64
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.730
&gt;&gt; If you have it as a extension on VS
code, do we still need to download it?

65
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.530
The answer is yes.

66
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.343
But maybe not for
the reason that you think,

67
00:03:40.343 --> 00:03:44.200
you can actually do it through VS code and
never have to install it ever again.

68
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.438
But if this is a project that you
want to work on long term and

69
00:03:46.438 --> 00:03:48.947
maybe other people are going to come
use it, you need to set it up so

70
00:03:48.947 --> 00:03:50.880
anybody can use it even if
they don't use VS code.

71
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

72
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.010
&gt;&gt; Yep.
You're basically also just providing

73
00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.218
a manifest to all future, selves as well
as other people that this is the setup

74
00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:03.909
that I have for this project right and
by putting prettier in there,

75
00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.270
like this is a project that uses prettier.

76
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.591
Okay, the next thing you need to do is you
need to create a file here in the root of

77
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:16.140
your project.

78
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.480
New file, we're gonna call it dot.

79
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:25.120
The dot is very important, so
please put the dot prettier rc.

80
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.440
And this is basically
the configuration for prettier.

81
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.100
Here you can configure I want
two spaces versus four spaces.

82
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.990
Please use tabs, please use single quotes,
please use double quotes.

83
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.310
You put that all here inside of an object.

84
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.060
And my favorite configuration for
prettier is just empty object.

85
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.200
I just want all the defaults.

86
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.761
I don't want to think about any of
this because like I said before,

87
00:04:49.761 --> 00:04:51.560
I actually don't care
about the formatting.

88
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.370
I just want someone to always do it.

89
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.840
For me, and I never wanna think about it.

90
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.922
So this is really easy because I
never have to think about what

91
00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:03.220
configuration of it I want.

92
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.083
It just works.

93
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.440
Okay, so I'm gonna save that.

94
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.314
And then here instead of my
package.json we're gonna create,

95
00:05:13.314 --> 00:05:15.010
you can delete this test script.

96
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.661
Script is basically like a repository of
shell commands that work inside of your

97
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:23.250
project.

98
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.069
So every time that I want run, MPM run
format, I want it to run prettier for me.

99
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.610
So I'm gonna say prettier -- write.

100
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.641
This is going to tell
prettier to write out and

101
00:05:37.641 --> 00:05:41.790
modify all of your code
to the correct format.

102
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.200
And then here I'm gonna say and you'll
have to stick with me for just a second.

103
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.028
Because it does require
some regex backslash,

104
00:05:51.028 --> 00:05:55.150
quote everything inside
of the source directory.

105
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:00.370
Then you put a forward slash,
star star slash star.

106
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.700
This is basically saying every file in
this directory, no matter the depth,

107
00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.948
right, so if it's inside of like six
directories go down recursively all of

108
00:06:10.948 --> 00:06:16.580
those directories, dot and then we
want to only work on particular types.

109
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.730
Have files who wanted to work on JS and
JSX files slash JSX.

110
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.281
This is how you say like I
wanted to write on JS files and

111
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:27.960
JSX files that's what
the curly braces means.

112
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.600
Again, this is not a regex course.

113
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.480
Then we have to put backslash quote and
then quote.

114
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:38.039
So if you don't really understand it
not really the point of this class,

115
00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.890
I wouldn't worry too much about it.

116
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.440
But basically,
you're just writing prettier.

117
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.480
And you're telling it
which files to write.

118
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.830
That's what this does is like,

119
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.960
write out to all of my JavaScript
files inside of my source directory.

120
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.696
That's what this entire thing means.

121
00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:56.235
And again, I provide this in here because
we're gonna have VS code do it for

122
00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:58.850
us here in just a second but
not everyone uses VS code.

123
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.878
So, if someone comes in here with them,

124
00:07:00.878 --> 00:07:03.810
they should still be able to do
the exact same setup as you.

125
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.817
So now, if I run NPM run format,

126
00:07:08.817 --> 00:07:14.482
make sure after you have to
save this now you can see here,

127
00:07:14.482 --> 00:07:19.474
it overrode app.js and it reformatted it.

128
00:07:19.474 --> 00:07:20.990
Here we go.

129
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.660
So this is what it looks like before.

130
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.220
This is what I had it as right.

131
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.401
Now if I say that this is what
it looks like afterwards.

132
00:07:33.738 --> 00:07:36.510
So some of you might say like Brian,
I like to better before right?

133
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.888
Like I liked how you had
it formatted before and and

134
00:07:38.888 --> 00:07:41.840
prettier just doesn't care
about your feelings, right?.

135
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.730
It just does it however it
thinks that should do it.

136
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.390
But honestly, I love this because I
never ever have to think about this.

137
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.980
It just happens for me.

138
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:55.920
&gt;&gt; What if I want to make
a custom create here?

139
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.680
Configuration.

140
00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:02.547
&gt;&gt; So the way that you do that is
through in this prettier RC file,

141
00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:06.886
you can put various different
I want JSX single quotes or

142
00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:12.120
I wanna use tabs instead of spaces
that would be inside of here.

143
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.210
There's a pretty limited amount of knobs
to turn here but there are some that you.

144
00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:16.150
You can turn, and

145
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.480
that's all on the prettier docks
if you wanna go through that.

146
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.010
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

147
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.260
&gt;&gt; Yep.

148
00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.573
The one thing I was gonna say,
notice if I run NPM format again,

149
00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:35.055
it's grayed out because it's
not modifying it right.

150
00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:38.535
It's a all this was already formatted with
prettier I'm not gonna do anything to it.

151
00:08:41.035 --> 00:08:44.055
Whereas like up here was in white,
because that means it did overwrite it.

152
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.970
So let's install the VS code extension.

153
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:52.863
If you click here on the side of VS code,

154
00:08:52.863 --> 00:08:57.440
these are the extensions and
search for one called prettier.

155
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.823
You can see here I've already
installed it pretty crude for

156
00:09:02.823 --> 00:09:09.920
matter from it should be the one that
has by far the most installs, right?

157
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:13.740
Yes, Ben p dot prettier dash VS code.

158
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:16.000
So install that.

159
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.610
And then there's a couple
things that you need to enable.

160
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.929
So if you open your settings which
you can do at any time by command,

161
00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:31.068
comma or control,
comma depending on what you're on, so

162
00:09:31.068 --> 00:09:33.870
the first thing to do is format on save.

163
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.610
Make sure that that's checked.

164
00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:41.560
This will make sure that prettier
runs every time you save a file.

165
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.133
And then the other one that
you wanna open is prettier.

166
00:09:48.137 --> 00:09:49.535
And.

167
00:09:51.618 --> 00:09:52.818
Config.

168
00:09:58.199 --> 00:09:59.510
Yeah, this one here.

169
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:04.470
So if you search for prettier config,
turn on this one called Require Config.

170
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:10.428
So what this will do is if you put
a prettier file inside of a project

171
00:10:10.428 --> 00:10:12.610
then prettier knows okay?

172
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.204
This is now when I need to run otherwise
it will run on every file that you ever

173
00:10:16.204 --> 00:10:19.020
open in VS code,
which is probably not like what you want.

174
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:22.170
You only wanna run prettier projects.

175
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.530
And that's what this does.

176
00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:26.684
So it just waits until there's a prettier
config file and then it'll run,

177
00:10:26.684 --> 00:10:33.500
otherwise it won't, Okay?

178
00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.080
Those are the two things now.

179
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.072
Now if I go and
mess up the spacing in here, right,

180
00:10:38.072 --> 00:10:40.480
let's just take off all the spacing.

181
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.363
So now everything's pushed
against the side and

182
00:10:43.363 --> 00:10:45.830
just looks really terrible, right?

183
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:50.030
As soon as I hit Command S and
save everything, just reformat.

184
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.832
Beautifully.

185
00:10:55.914 --> 00:10:59.932
Are here if I just put like a million
spaces some of the things that will

186
00:10:59.932 --> 00:11:04.320
try and say like well you will think you
are trying to put a lot of space here.

187
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.186
So I'll try and keep some of it for you.

188
00:11:13.156 --> 00:11:16.693
But now this is really useful because
now if I like paste code in and save it,

189
00:11:16.693 --> 00:11:18.400
it'll just format everything.

190
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.363
So everything looks like it's
part of the same project.
