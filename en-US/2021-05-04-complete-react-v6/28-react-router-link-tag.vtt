00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.223
The next thing that we need to
do is let's go into pet.js.

2
00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:12.301
This is an a tag and
once we're using react router,

3
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.123
we want to switch everything
to using their link tags.

4
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.027
So we're gonna import

5
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.725
Link from react router DOM and

6
00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.030
we're just going to switch this
a tag here to be link, link.

7
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.040
And this href instead of calling
it a href, they call it two.

8
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.590
So just change that to be 2,
now why do we do that?

9
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.546
Well, if you click that link,

10
00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:52.250
it's going to assume that that anchor tag
is taking you to a whole separate page.

11
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.390
And that's not actually really
what we want to happen.

12
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.676
We wanted to actually capture that
navigation so the user doesn't reload

13
00:00:58.676 --> 00:01:01.390
the React application and
then it doesn't unload, react.

14
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.229
So, whereas before it would have
reloaded the entire page, now,

15
00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.295
if If I click one of these links here,
notice that it doesn't like flash, right?

16
00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:16.745
It's because it's not
reloading the page altogether.

17
00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:20.316
React router is now capturing that
routing event that navigation event and

18
00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:23.495
it's doing the navigation without
reloading the application.

19
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:25.795
This is now a single page application.

20
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.353
That's the point of that, but

21
00:01:28.353 --> 00:01:31.505
it's important that you have to use links
instead of A's to get that behavior,

22
00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:34.160
otherwise, it's just gonna say,
okay, you're leaving cool.

23
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.031
I'm going to send you off to a brand
new page, and you'll reload the react

24
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:39.781
application every single time,
which is probably not what you want.

25
00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:45.607
Make sense?

26
00:01:45.607 --> 00:01:48.553
Great.

27
00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:59.736
Let's go where App.js and let's just make
this our link tag as well, so up here,

28
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:08.604
From react-router-dom,
just make sure importing the link as well.

29
00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:14.267
And we're gonna wrap this
in a link to equals and

30
00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:19.636
we're just gonna have to take
you to home cause like when your

31
00:02:19.636 --> 00:02:25.340
users click the header,
they expect to go back to the homepage.

32
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.958
That's just the behavior that
we're gonna implement now.

33
00:02:32.095 --> 00:02:33.958
And actually,
let's put that inside of a header, yeah,

34
00:02:33.958 --> 00:02:35.110
cause it's not inside of a header.

35
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.955
Let's just do that, header.

36
00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.780
There we go.

37
00:02:48.961 --> 00:02:54.066
So now, what disappeared,

38
00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:57.050
that's weird.

39
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.187
What did we do?

40
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.054
Yeah, you have to be inside of the router.

41
00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:07.120
So another thing, it's like hey,
I put a link tag here but

42
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.390
it has no router to refer to, so
it's gonna throw me an error.

43
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.624
So we have to actually move
this inside of the router.

44
00:03:16.352 --> 00:03:18.998
And now, if you go back over here,
it'll be happy again.

45
00:03:22.106 --> 00:03:24.732
It's a good piece of technology
I've used it in several places,

46
00:03:24.732 --> 00:03:25.650
we used it at Netflix.

47
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.227
I used to really early
version when I was at Reddit.

48
00:03:32.043 --> 00:03:34.845
It's solid, like lots of really
big companies to use, obviously,

49
00:03:34.845 --> 00:03:36.500
I think Facebook uses in places as well.

50
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.540
It's definitely the most used router.
