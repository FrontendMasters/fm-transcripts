1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.120
Let's go implement this.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.243
Let's go into this in detail such as.

3
00:00:07.984 --> 00:00:11.009
Whenever the user clicks adopt,
I want to show them like,

4
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.810
are you sure you want to
adopt this animal, right?.

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.030
You don't want people just haphazard like,
I adopted a pet right?.

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.170
I don't know.

7
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.902
Depends on I guess your
goals if you want to get it,

8
00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:21.180
all of them adopted immediately.

9
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.720
He might just auto click it for him.

10
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.691
I'll just mail him a dog.

11
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:25.757
It's bad idea.
Don't do that.

12
00:00:29.215 --> 00:00:37.950
Okay, so we're gonna import modal at
the top import modal from ./ modal state.

13
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.030
We're going to add another
one called show modal false.

14
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.638
We're gonna add 2 methods here.

15
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:57.080
And the 1st method is gonna
be called toggle modal.

16
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.708
And it's gonna be really simple,
It's just gonna say this set state.

17
00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:14.018
And show Modal is gonna be whatever the
opposite of show Modal is this set State.

18
00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:19.878
Right?.

19
00:01:19.878 --> 00:01:20.380
So if it's true, make it false.

20
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.171
If it's false, make it true.

21
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.240
And then we're gonna add
another button for adopt.

22
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.240
So what are we going to do
if they actually adopt it.

23
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.740
Adopt?.

24
00:01:33.205 --> 00:01:36.128
Here you'd have some
logic of call the API,

25
00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:40.040
let the shelter know that
this pets been adopted.

26
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.041
Here I'm just going to
Window dot location,

27
00:01:44.041 --> 00:01:49.530
send you to a website that will
actually let you adopt pets.

28
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.750
So Bitly/pet_ adopt.

29
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:02.303
That's just gonna send you to pet
finder and you can adopt a pet there.

30
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:04.231
Okay.

31
00:02:07.444 --> 00:02:07.944
So.

32
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.992
What we're gonna do on our button
here we're gonna add an on Click.

33
00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:22.776
And on Click we're just going to
toggle modal this, toggle modal.

34
00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:29.749
So because inherently if
they click this button,

35
00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.632
it's not showing it's gonna show it.

36
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.808
And then underneath description, I mean
really we can put this anywhere because

37
00:02:36.808 --> 00:02:38.340
it's gonna render outside of itself.

38
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.259
We're just gonna say, hey, if show modal.

39
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.924
Then render this.

40
00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:50.152
Inside of a modal.

41
00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.635
Div, Each one,

42
00:02:56.635 --> 00:03:00.822
would you like to adopt name?.

43
00:03:07.352 --> 00:03:14.735
And then div, class name equals buttons.

44
00:03:17.314 --> 00:03:24.770
Buttons, 1st one is gonna be on Click,
equals this started dot.

45
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.510
Yes.

46
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.440
And then we'll have another one for this
toggle model, which is mean they click No.

47
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.826
So we're going to hide it at that point.

48
00:03:33.826 --> 00:03:34.326
No.

49
00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:40.632
I'm just kidding you can put
whatever you want, there.

50
00:03:44.585 --> 00:03:49.342
Okay, and if show modal is not true then

51
00:03:49.342 --> 00:03:54.109
what you just want to do is put colon no.

52
00:03:59.065 --> 00:04:02.920
Yeah, and this one has to be this dot
state, where you can pull it out of here.

53
00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.526
So up here underneath and where we're
pulling out all everything from the state,

54
00:04:07.526 --> 00:04:09.192
you just have to pull
out show modal as well.

55
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.990
Right?.

56
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.746
Cuz we're pulling that out of state so
we can use it,

57
00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:19.000
then down here we're seeing
if show model is true.

58
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.340
Render all this stuff in a modal.

59
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.713
And then the nice thing react can handle
if you give react no, it's just like,

60
00:04:26.713 --> 00:04:29.156
okay, don't render anything, right.

61
00:04:29.156 --> 00:04:34.149
In this particular case, if we don't want
to show a model, don't render anything.

62
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.330
For that particular piece.

63
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.800
That makes sense?.

64
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.582
That's interesting talking about
this set State show Modal,

65
00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:47.378
I put set State here,
just this state show Modal.

66
00:04:49.648 --> 00:04:51.890
That's hilarious that works that way.

67
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.369
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense,
the wonders of JavaScript.

68
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.400
So line 26 here, this dot State dot,

69
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.410
show modal hopefully you've
just got that right.

70
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.200
I had set state here on accident,
but it should just be state.

71
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:09.560
Okay.

72
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.930
Now if we refresh and try again, click No.

73
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:14.440
There you go.

74
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.030
Now it hides it.

75
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.690
And then if you click yes, it'll take
you to somewhere to adopt a pet.

76
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.943
&gt;&gt; Can we use the context for
the theme context for this as well,

77
00:05:29.943 --> 00:05:32.650
or do we have to create it from scratch?.

78
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.440
Cuz these buttons were, I think read.

79
00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

80
00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.509
You could absolutely wrap
this on a theme consumer,

81
00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.804
we could do exactly what we did here and
put that here right.

82
00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.293
And that would color those
buttons those particular way.

83
00:05:48.293 --> 00:05:50.367
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

84
00:05:50.367 --> 00:05:50.940
&gt;&gt; Good question.

85
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.202
So the part that I just wanna point
out to you, that really cool,

86
00:05:57.202 --> 00:05:58.946
that's kind of easy than this.

87
00:05:58.946 --> 00:06:02.330
I'm calling this.adopt, this.toggleModal.

88
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.220
Those are features of
the details component, right?.

89
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.870
And I'm referencing name, and I could
reference all sorts of other stuff.

90
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.380
But like, think of where this
lives in the DOM, right?.

91
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:19.527
So if I inspect element here,
Like I have modal here, right,

92
00:06:19.527 --> 00:06:23.920
but the app actually lives in route, so
it's actually living outside of routes.

93
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.145
I'm referencing state in a different part
of the application calling functions from

94
00:06:27.145 --> 00:06:28.710
a different part of it.

95
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.683
What's even like kind of wild here
is if I put like a event listener up

96
00:06:33.683 --> 00:06:38.412
here on details, I can listen for
events that happen in modals.

97
00:06:38.412 --> 00:06:41.214
Because it's actually react
synthetic event system,

98
00:06:41.214 --> 00:06:43.260
that's handling those events.

99
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.477
Right, so you can actually use
event bubbling inside of react, and

100
00:06:46.477 --> 00:06:50.260
have a bubble out of portals and back
into like the normal parts of the DOM.

101
00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.380
It's kind of wild stuff,
it actually is occasionally useful.

102
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.720
So it's an advanced use case.

103
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.370
It's not something you always need to use,
but when it's useful, it's very useful.

104
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.414
Is there any like performance
considerations, or

105
00:07:01.414 --> 00:07:03.419
any probably just downfalls
of using portals?.

106
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:05.866
I think the answer that's No,

107
00:07:05.866 --> 00:07:09.010
I don't think there's any
performance hit by using portals.

108
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.515
I'm not going to give you hard and
fast rules because there's going to be

109
00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.979
occasions, that you're going to want
to do one thing versus another.

110
00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:18.360
But performance is not going
to be consideration here.

111
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.386
Even in like high performance,

112
00:07:21.386 --> 00:07:25.840
kind of Situation a portal acts
just as well as anything else.

113
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:31.689
I mean the only machination that's going
on that's a little bit more different,

114
00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:35.842
is the fact that it's having to create and
destroy disk but

115
00:07:35.842 --> 00:07:38.150
I guess it has to do that anyway.

116
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:41.118
So there's no performance, sorry I had to,

117
00:07:41.118 --> 00:07:45.480
you were my rubber ducky I had
to rubber duck that aloud.

118
00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.450
Yeah, there's no reason for that.

119
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.990
So I would suggest just doing it this way.
