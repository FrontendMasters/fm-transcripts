1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
One of my favorite tools again
being an infrastructure is Babel.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.590
I just like it.

3
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.718
Probably a glutton for
punishment, I suppose.

4
00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:09.170
But it's a transpiler tool.

5
00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.939
It takes code that looks one way and
it makes it look a different way.

6
00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.725
And that's really the some of
the store it's not a compiler, right?.

7
00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:19.580
You're not taking like a C++ source
code and compiling it to a binary.

8
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.756
That's compilation translation is,
I have a set of source code and

9
00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.830
I'm making it just different source code.

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.540
So, Babel is already working for
us underneath the hood.

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.674
One of the things that it does for us,
you can write things in es 2021, and

12
00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:36.353
it'll transpile Harder for
you to IES 2015.

13
00:00:36.353 --> 00:00:38.735
So it still works in Internet Explorer.

14
00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:42.035
However, we have some advanced needs.

15
00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:44.738
And so typically you wouldn't
have to mess with this, and

16
00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:48.420
I would say probably soon with parcel too,
you won't have to do this.

17
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.400
So if you're using parcel tool,
you can just ignore this section.

18
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.576
But if you have to modify Babel, you
can just drop in the Babel RC file, and

19
00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:56.588
parcel will automatically read that for
you.

20
00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:58.480
And change how your Babel is working.

21
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.310
So I want you to make a new file here.

22
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.610
In the adopt me directory.

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.364
Called .babelrc.

24
00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:18.051
So you can see here outside of my source
directory I have a file called .babelrc.

25
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:21.829
And we're going to add just a little
bit of configuration, to make

26
00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.500
it use the latest version of JSX, which
is something we're about to start doing.

27
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.880
So here,
you're gonna make an empty object.

28
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.460
We're gonna do presets,
and it has a array.

29
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.034
And the 1st one we're going to put
in there is @babble/preset -react.

30
00:01:45.712 --> 00:01:48.049
This is actually gonna be
inside of an array itself.

31
00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:58.212
Okay, inside of that array
with it is gonna be an object.

32
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.181
And we have to put run
time Colin automatic.

33
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.394
Let's make this a little
bit better format, and

34
00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:18.570
it's kind of a mess to configure Babel.

35
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.330
I don't know why they chose
this style of configuration.

36
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.920
But we have presets which is a list
of presets that we have in there.

37
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.990
This will be getting merged
with the ones that parcel has.

38
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.589
A parcel has other presets
that it's putting in there for

39
00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.820
you like one called M,
which is very important.

40
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.950
We don't have to read Eclair that here.

41
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.240
We just have to say like here's the things
that we have that are different.

42
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.066
Here we're gonna bring in this babelrc
preset react which again, it already has.

43
00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:48.050
But we need to have this
configuration of runtime automatic.

44
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.944
This allows us to do the most
recent version of JSX.

45
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.239
Which I'll explain to you once we start
seeing it, but this is important for

46
00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.000
us to get started.

47
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.880
Okay, the next thing that we need to do,
I'm gonna stop my server.

48
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.930
You can stop your parcel server
at any time by hitting Ctrl C.

49
00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:20.012
And we need to do npm install -D @babel.

50
00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:30.012
/core@7.12.16.@babel/preset-react@7.12.13.

51
00:03:46.665 --> 00:03:51.449
So we have to give it
the node modules that it's

52
00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.258
going to use to do that translation.

53
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:03.471
Okay, so now,
if you go look at your package.json,

54
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:07.351
you'll see here that we have babel and
babel preset-react.

55
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.350
And now we have via this babel RC,
every time that parcel runs,

56
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.190
it's gonna be using this configuration for
our presets.

57
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.640
For react, we'll modify this more
in the future here in the course.

58
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.600
But for now, this is enough for
us to get started.

59
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.680
We've basically set up what create
react app sets up for you, but

60
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.530
it's going to be catered to our needs.

61
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.326
Exactly.

62
00:04:29.326 --> 00:04:31.900
And now you're going to understand every
tool that's gone into your tool chain.

63
00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.710
&gt;&gt; I have a quick question about one of
the files generated in the dist folder?.

64
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.150
What's the dot map doing exactly?.

65
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.060
&gt;&gt; What Babel are.

66
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.020
Sorry, what parcel is doing for
you is you have this dist directory.

67
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.220
And this is the files that you would
actually send out to production, right.

68
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.920
And so you can see here they have long
funky names and all that kind of stuff.

69
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.200
But you notice that like your index,
HTML, references, everything correctly.

70
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.050
This is all the stuff that
parcel is generating for you.

71
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.965
So the 1st answer to your question
is you don't have to care.

72
00:05:04.965 --> 00:05:07.643
[LAUGH].
It's actually not important to you, but

73
00:05:07.643 --> 00:05:10.900
to answer your questions,
they have these funky map files.

74
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.948
Because we're doing this
in development mode,

75
00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:19.328
what we wanna be able to do is inside of
Firefox or Edge or Chrome or whatever.

76
00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:23.290
We wanna be able to see the source files,
not the distribution files.

77
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.160
And the map files
reference the source files.

78
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.743
So that when I'm looking at the code
inside of the dev tools in Chrome or

79
00:05:29.743 --> 00:05:30.299
Firefox.

80
00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:34.566
It's showing me the real source code and
not the generated code.

81
00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:36.091
They're called source maps.

82
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:36.850
&gt;&gt; I mean coding.

83
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.300
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's precisely what they're for.

84
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.769
You should not ship these to production.

85
00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:42.450
Right?.

86
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.340
Otherwise, you're linking
off your source source code.

87
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.310
Last thing that I promise we're going to
start writing some more react, I promise.

88
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.631
I want you to go back into
your package dot JSON

89
00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:58.538
somewhere in here,
I'm just going to put it last.

90
00:05:58.538 --> 00:06:02.439
I want you to create a property called,
browsers.

91
00:06:06.548 --> 00:06:07.418
Browser list.

92
00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:12.960
Make sure that as browsers
with an S I always forget it.

93
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.140
It's browsers Plural list.

94
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.800
This is how you identify to babble and
parcel.

95
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.510
I'm targeting these browsers.

96
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.220
So this is an array of all
the browsers that you want to target.

97
00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.595
Because this is just a development course,
and it's just you and

98
00:06:31.595 --> 00:06:34.700
me working on this and we're not
shipping this to production ever.

99
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.573
I'm just gonna say last 2 chrome versions,
which is to say,

100
00:06:39.573 --> 00:06:44.920
very new JavaScript don't transpile for
really old browsers.

101
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:47.750
This is not what you'd want to do
in your production applications.

102
00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.030
And by the way, you can put Firefox or
something like that.

103
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.388
Whatever you want that to be, ends up for

104
00:06:53.388 --> 00:06:56.420
the purpose of this
code was not mattering.

105
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.161
But we'll put the last two
chrome versions there.

106
00:07:01.499 --> 00:07:05.988
Now, if you needed to target,
I don't know, IE11, there's a bunch of

107
00:07:05.988 --> 00:07:10.210
them here that you can put here of like,
I don't think this one works.

108
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.830
But I think he can put
something like this.

109
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.723
I wanna target most people in the world
which you would do with something like

110
00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:24.179
this, or don't target opera or
anything like that.

111
00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:25.270
We're not gonna get into browsers.

112
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.210
That's exactly what it does.

113
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.551
But here we're just telling
it last 2 chrome versions,

114
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:30.610
because we just don't want
it to transpire a lot.

115
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.670
We're gonna be using modern browsers.

116
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:34.070
So we're just gonna stick to that.

117
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:43.690
If you wanna find out more about that
you can just go to browserslist.dev.

118
00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:53.910
So if I put last 2 chrome
versions like that.

119
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.920
It'll tell you everything
that you're targeting.

120
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:59.250
Right now I'm covering 30%
of the world's population.

121
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.570
That's objectively terrible.

122
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.130
Do not ship your applications like that.

123
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:07.877
But I'm part of that 30% population
right now, so it works for me.

124
00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:12.279
But this will help you with.

125
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:20.689
Various different strings,
to figure out what you wanna put there.

126
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:24.620
Okay, that's the end of the tool section.

127
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.100
You survived,
you can get the back to react now.

128
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:36.255
So again, we have a Point here, if you
go down to the bottom of browsers list.

129
00:08:36.255 --> 00:08:41.071
There's this part here,
you can click on this, just come in here,

130
00:08:41.071 --> 00:08:46.580
run npm install and you will be off to
the races with all the tools you install.

131
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.625
Already.

132
00:08:49.586 --> 00:08:52.767
&gt;&gt; So from the browser list is Babel and
parser required or

133
00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:55.910
can you specify that without them?.

134
00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:00.420
&gt;&gt; You will need some tool that pays
attention to what browsers list Is.

135
00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:05.880
So for examples, post CSS is another
tool that pays attention to it.

136
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.920
But you would need something
that's going to read it.

137
00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.891
So it's just kind of
like a top level tool,

138
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:15.280
telling various other tools,
what you're trying to target.

139
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.760
So Babel is one of
the tools that read that.

140
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.800
So in this particular case,
if you didn't have Babel and parcel,

141
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.900
nothing would happen.
