00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.220
So Strict Mode is a mode that you can
put React into that it is less chill.

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.408
[LAUGH] It's basically gonna
throw stronger errors at you, and

3
00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:14.230
it's gonna enforce more opinions on you.

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.300
And this comes directly
from the React core team.

5
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.630
So it's generally a good idea.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.700
Specifically, let's see react unsafe.

7
00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:35.007
So there's a bunch of methods here
called like unsafe component will mount.

8
00:00:35.007 --> 00:00:38.433
And there's other kinds of things
that they're deprecated, but

9
00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.153
they don't want you to use them.

10
00:00:40.153 --> 00:00:43.827
And what Strict Mode basically
doesn't allow you to use then.

11
00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:47.603
Basically, what's happening is,
it's kind of a way for

12
00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:52.149
the React team to slowly phase out
old API's that don't work as well or

13
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.020
are incompatible with their future model.

14
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.276
So they cannot use, all right, in React
17 you can use these unsafe ones, and

15
00:01:00.276 --> 00:01:03.103
then we're gonna remove them in React 18,
right?

16
00:01:03.103 --> 00:01:06.319
That's kind of that sort of
methodology of phasing out API's.

17
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.271
What strict mode does is it just says
we're not going to allow you to introduce

18
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.550
any of these things.

19
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.550
We're only going to let you
work on current safe APIs.

20
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.123
I think there's some other
things in there as well,

21
00:01:20.123 --> 00:01:22.490
but that's kind of the gist of it.

22
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.920
So what I want you to do is I want you to
go into your application really quick.

23
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.444
I want you to go to app.js, and

24
00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:36.213
just surrounding your app here,
I want you to put Strict Mode.

25
00:01:40.112 --> 00:01:42.169
Strict Mode.

26
00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:49.450
And surround that with, so
it's kind of strange, right?

27
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.210
Because Strict Mode in and
of itself has zero functionality.

28
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.960
All it does is it enforces a certain
way of writing components.

29
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.956
But you would call this a higher order
component in React in the sense that it

30
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:06.730
itself doesn't do anything, but it offers
functionality to its children components.

31
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.914
So wrap app in Strict Mode just like that,
and then at the top,

32
00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:14.730
you're gonna have to import
Strict Mode from React.

33
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.953
The first question that people
always ask me about this is,

34
00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:21.660
does this make my bundle size bigger?

35
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.230
And the answer is no, it does not.

36
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.280
It gets stripped out in production builds.

37
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.520
Next question you might ask me is, why did
I wrap app and why did I not put it here?

38
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.640
And the answer is you absolutely can.

39
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.310
And I have no opinion,
really, of how you do that.

40
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:45.930
I'd have to put a comma there.

41
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.255
&gt;&gt; You do need the div as well.

42
00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:50.459
&gt;&gt; This div?

43
00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.870
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you do need the div.

44
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.420
We're gonna talk about fragments later.

45
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.410
So you can do this either way.

46
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.220
But I've seen it done both ways.

47
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.292
I'm just gonna put it here because
that's what my notes have, but

48
00:03:09.292 --> 00:03:10.880
feel free to do it either way.

49
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.780
So that's Strict Mode, it's basically just
additional free help from the React team.

50
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.330
I always accept free help.

51
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.671
I love automated help,
it's my favorite kinda help.
