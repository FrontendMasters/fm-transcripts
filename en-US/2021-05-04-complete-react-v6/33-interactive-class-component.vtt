1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.476
So, going back to Carousel.

2
00:00:05.142 --> 00:00:09.790
What we need to do is we need to add some
way of having an event listener, right?

3
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.108
So, some sort of like event handler,
yeah, it's just that.

4
00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:21.275
So, we're gonna put in a the function
called handleIndexClick.

5
00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:28.443
And we're going to give it an event.

6
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.275
And then, here,
we're just gonna say this dot setState.

7
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.900
And then,

8
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.820
we wanna somehow get that index back
from which one they clicked on, right?

9
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.000
So, if they clicked on number three here,
we wanna get that back so

10
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.100
that we can set that as the state.

11
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.675
And so, how do we do that?

12
00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:57.010
Well, just normal HTML stuff.

13
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.629
We're just gonna say data Dash index.

14
00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:08.492
Okay, and then we're gonna say index.

15
00:01:08.492 --> 00:01:12.236
And then, now, we can grab this
index here off of the event.

16
00:01:14.643 --> 00:01:16.847
Might as well put our
onClick handler here.

17
00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:22.410
This dot handleIndexCclick.

18
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.649
So, you're gonna notice right away,

19
00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.320
the accessibility
no-noninteractive-element clicks.

20
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.296
This is absolutely valid and

21
00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:32.296
you should absolutely not
ship this production, right?

22
00:01:32.296 --> 00:01:35.499
Because an image is not a button,
so therefore,

23
00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.773
a screen reader would not find it.

24
00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:43.122
Without the sake of complicating
this too much, I'm just gonna,

25
00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:48.672
for now, put this as slash,
slash eslint-disable-next-line.

26
00:01:48.672 --> 00:01:53.553
But suffice to say,
this should be a button, okay?

27
00:01:59.513 --> 00:02:03.544
All right, so here,
we're gonna say this dot setState.

28
00:02:03.544 --> 00:02:08.644
We're gonna say active,
and then we're gonna

29
00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:13.370
say event dot target
dot data set dot index.

30
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.450
Now, I'm not gonna get too much into this,
this is just normal browser stuff.

31
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.010
The event dot target is actually
gonna be the image tag here, right?

32
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.910
And the data set is going to be things
that you do like data dash blah.

33
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.050
So, data set's gonna be if I had one for
a data dash whatevs, right?

34
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.693
That would come up here as data
set dash dot whatevs, right?

35
00:02:43.651 --> 00:02:48.647
Okay, last thing here is this
actually comes back as a string,

36
00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:51.770
cuz reading that from the DOM, right?

37
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.483
So, we actually want this to be a number.

38
00:02:53.483 --> 00:02:56.766
So, an easy way of doing that is just
prefixing it with a plus sign, and

39
00:02:56.766 --> 00:03:00.118
that will actually coerce it so
this will actually be a real number now.

40
00:03:00.118 --> 00:03:03.847
So, make sure that's a number just
by putting that plus sign there.

41
00:03:03.847 --> 00:03:08.528
There's other ways of doing it,
but that's just the easiest way.

42
00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:13.968
You could also do zero plus event type,
that would work as well.

43
00:03:13.968 --> 00:03:17.667
There's a bunch of things,
easiest way for me is plus sign.

44
00:03:22.916 --> 00:03:24.204
And now, we save it.

45
00:03:27.648 --> 00:03:28.298
Refresh.

46
00:03:28.298 --> 00:03:35.467
If we start clicking on these,
still not working, why is that?

47
00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:39.470
This is undefined.

48
00:03:43.741 --> 00:03:44.960
Well, that's unexpected, right?

49
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.439
Why would this be undefined?

50
00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.430
I just said here this dot setState,

51
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.100
shouldn't that refer to Carousel?

52
00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.650
Well, it actually works just
like how the browser works.

53
00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.362
If I set an event listener and
I don't bind what this is,

54
00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:02.590
what is this going to be?

55
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.670
Let's actually take a look.

56
00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:09.597
Click on that.

57
00:04:09.597 --> 00:04:13.450
You can see here,
it actually logs out undefined.

58
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.150
It's because it's being called
outside of any sort of context.

59
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.630
Well, that's unfortunate, right?

60
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.800
You have a couple of options here.

61
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.620
You can do this dot handleClick
dot bind(this), this'll work.

62
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.054
In fact, if I save now,
I'm pretty sure it will.

63
00:04:37.302 --> 00:04:38.346
That works just fine, right?

64
00:04:40.912 --> 00:04:44.698
But I'm gonna show you my favorite way,
you can also do it in the constructor.

65
00:04:44.698 --> 00:04:48.115
The constructor, you can say this dot
handle click equals this dot handleClick

66
00:04:48.115 --> 00:04:51.370
dot bind(this),
that would totally work as well.

67
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.140
That's how I used to do it.

68
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.093
But because we have this class property,
seems to me we can kind of cheat

69
00:04:56.093 --> 00:04:58.672
a little bit and it's kinda fun,
and I'm gonna show you how.

70
00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:02.448
handleClick equals (event), and

71
00:05:02.448 --> 00:05:07.205
we turn this into an arrow
function like this.

72
00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:12.669
This'll actually work now, and it's cuz
of the way that arrow functions work.

73
00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.029
If I refresh, notice is still works,

74
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.918
notice that the context
of this is correct.

75
00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:26.352
The reason for
that is whenever you do arrow function,

76
00:05:26.352 --> 00:05:28.393
it doesn't create a new
this wherever it is, right?

77
00:05:28.393 --> 00:05:31.987
So, whenever I call handleClick index,
it's not going to get the this from

78
00:05:31.987 --> 00:05:35.762
wherever it's called, it's gonna get
the this from wherever it's created.

79
00:05:35.762 --> 00:05:39.076
If you wanna get more into that,
there's plenty of JavaScript courses here

80
00:05:39.076 --> 00:05:41.317
on Frontend Masters,
they'll talk all about it.

81
00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:46.908
But suffice to say, if you need to get
this to be correct with class components,

82
00:05:46.908 --> 00:05:49.460
this is a really easy way to do that.

83
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.530
Just make it an arrow function and
everything will work.
