00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.000
Lets go ahead and
go make pet actually look half decent.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.300
So head back to pet.js, we're just
gonna spruce it up a little bit.

3
00:00:09.995 --> 00:00:14.670
Get rid of that, so here, we're gonna do

4
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.747
structure up here and
we're gonna say name,

5
00:00:19.747 --> 00:00:24.703
animal, breed, images, location, ID.

6
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.165
So now we're destruction
what's coming in from this.

7
00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:34.867
Also in my notes, you can totally do
it this way as you can also say const

8
00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:38.710
name equals and
then have the destruction work that way.

9
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.730
That totally works as well.

10
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.605
I'm just gonna do it here,
cuz that's what I would normally do.

11
00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.596
Okay, and the next thing,

12
00:00:53.596 --> 00:00:59.432
just to be defensive, let's say let hero =

13
00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:08.450
http://pets-images.dev-apis.com/pets/none-
.jpg.

14
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.279
This is gonna be the little image
that shows up next to the pet.

15
00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:15.167
And if nothing comes back from the API,
we want it to look like this.

16
00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:26.078
Otherwise, if we got any
images back from the API,

17
00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:30.197
then we wanna make that the image.

18
00:01:30.197 --> 00:01:38.276
So we're gonna say hero = images[0],
the first one.

19
00:01:38.276 --> 00:01:43.929
Now, I think you actually could have said,
Does that work?

20
00:01:48.486 --> 00:01:50.750
I think this does, I mean,
let's just try it for fun.

21
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.810
Now you'd run into bugs with this,
so I wouldn't be happy with it.

22
00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.639
Basically what we are doing up here is
we'd say images equals this by default,

23
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:01.450
right?

24
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.528
So we'd always have
some array coming back.

25
00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:07.358
The problem where you would run into that
is what happens if you get an empty array

26
00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:10.673
back from the API, in which case,
it wouldn't have anything set and

27
00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:12.220
you'd have a problem.

28
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.630
So let's stick with this.

29
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.059
This definitely works.

30
00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:17.669
It's the problems when you try and
get too clever.

31
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.640
Okay, we're gonna make this entire
thing and a, an anchor tag,

32
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.805
a link, right,
because if someone clicks on the listing,

33
00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:29.300
we wanna send them to
a detailed profile page.

34
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.298
And the href here is gonna be

35
00:02:35.298 --> 00:02:39.807
equal to, that's colon.

36
00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.184
Let's just get rid of all of these.

37
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.672
It's gonna go to /details/${id}.

38
00:02:51.672 --> 00:02:54.385
That's gonna be the path that we're
gonna program here in a little bit.

39
00:02:56.898 --> 00:03:00.450
And the class name,
it's gonna be equal to pet.

40
00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:07.128
Inside of that we're gonna have two divs.

41
00:03:07.128 --> 00:03:12.904
One's gonna be className
= image-container.

42
00:03:12.904 --> 00:03:15.107
And that's gonna have the IMG.

43
00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:18.160
The source is gonna be equal to hero.

44
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.749
And the alt is gonna be equal to name.

45
00:03:24.716 --> 00:03:25.860
And then we have to close that.

46
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.302
Again, if you leave off the alt,
it's gonna yell at you as it should,

47
00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:32.783
cuz you don't have an alt text.

48
00:03:36.225 --> 00:03:38.146
And then the div underneath that,

49
00:03:42.423 --> 00:03:46.251
We're gonna have an H1 of name.

50
00:03:48.398 --> 00:03:50.790
And an H2 of,

51
00:03:56.693 --> 00:03:59.142
Just like various pieces of
information about the animal.

52
00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:04.485
So animal, I'm

53
00:04:04.485 --> 00:04:09.533
putting a dash between these,

54
00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:14.393
animal, breed, location.

55
00:04:24.109 --> 00:04:27.283
And we can actually delete that
import from React up there.

56
00:04:30.274 --> 00:04:32.815
And now we should have a nice
looking pet component.

57
00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:39.912
And like what you and I just went through
together, this is a lot of what React,

58
00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:43.452
it's just pulling out the props and
putting them in the proper locations, and

59
00:04:43.452 --> 00:04:46.145
wrapping them in the correct classes and
stuff like that.

60
00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:49.735
This is what, I'm gonna say,
most of writing React feels like.

61
00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:52.985
It's not terribly complicated
on the day to day.

62
00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:56.930
I'm showing you a lot of the edge cases so
that when you run into them,

63
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.435
you know how to do it, but
this is a major part of my job.

64
00:05:00.435 --> 00:05:03.962
Both Reddit and
Netflix was just doing stuff like this.

65
00:05:07.951 --> 00:05:15.216
So let's go back over here, and
you can see, Well, this is getting closer.

66
00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:17.102
We have pet images, that's good.

67
00:05:17.102 --> 00:05:18.370
I forgot the class name here.

68
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.458
Line 12, this div, className = info.

69
00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:32.900
So I decided this className
= info on line 12.

70
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.150
And now everything looks
significantly better.

71
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.318
And you get to see some dogs.

72
00:05:38.318 --> 00:05:39.959
You're welcome.

73
00:05:41.598 --> 00:05:43.651
This is actually my dog right there, Luna.

74
00:05:46.515 --> 00:05:49.950
These two belong to the production
staff here at Frontend Masters.

75
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.857
And then these two, just charmers,
Sudo and Beam belong to Sarah Dresner,

76
00:05:53.857 --> 00:05:57.046
who's another really good
instructor in Frontend Masters.

77
00:05:57.046 --> 00:05:59.940
If you haven't watched her classes,
you definitely should.

78
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.569
And then the rest of them
are just ones I made up.

79
00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.767
[LAUGH] Stock images with made up names.

80
00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:12.550
Okay, so
now we have 07 component composition.

81
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.960
That's the checkpoint that we're at now.

82
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:20.092
Does anyone have any questions about
anything that we just did together?

83
00:06:26.802 --> 00:06:28.300
No, you may not adopt my dog.

84
00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.052
She's a jerk sometimes.

85
00:06:30.052 --> 00:06:35.748
She always wants to eat at exactly
2:30PM when she doesn't eat till 4PM,

86
00:06:35.748 --> 00:06:37.743
and it's very upsetting.

87
00:06:39.143 --> 00:06:40.983
But you can't adopt her,
she's my little jerk.
