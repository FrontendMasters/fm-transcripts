00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.035
So in previous versions of this course I
taught older versions of react router and

2
00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:07.130
reach router.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.820
They're all from the same people.

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.916
But they do vary pretty considerably.

5
00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:17.760
And the one thing that I'll say about
react router that might be a minor

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.385
frustration to some of you is the version
three, version four and version four, for

7
00:00:22.385 --> 00:00:24.360
version five or wildly different.

8
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.970
And they're require rewriting your
application can be a bit of a point

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.730
of frustration, but
it's also by far the best router.

10
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.830
So it's kinda hard not to use it.

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.410
So in this particular case, we're gonna
be teaching react router five today.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.910
And I'll say that react router
six is about to come out, and

13
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.740
there's gonna be some
variation from that as well.

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.917
So look forward to taking
the intro to react to these seven,

15
00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:49.514
I'm sure we'll cover that.

16
00:00:49.514 --> 00:00:54.435
They're not that different and for
the purposes of this course, it doesn't

17
00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:59.506
actually vary that much, in version five
of this course I taught reach router,

18
00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:04.600
and updating that to react router
version five didn't take a lot of work.

19
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.840
So just be aware of that.

20
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.050
But yeah, we're gonna be talking about
react router version five today.

21
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.540
Okay, we already have one
route in our application.

22
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.330
If we head back over to our app.js,
you can see we have a search params route.

23
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.334
Now right now, that's all we have.

24
00:01:26.334 --> 00:01:28.720
But we won't be able to switch between
the two different pages, right?

25
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.070
We wanna have a SearchParams page and
we wanna have a details page.

26
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.468
So the first thing that we wanna do,

27
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.040
Let's go install our version
of react router that we want.

28
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.740
I didn't take a note here.

29
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.420
So let's go ahead and
make sure that we get the correct one.

30
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.890
So I'm gonna look in my page here.

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.648
We're gonna look at the package JSON and
we're going to get react router Dom 5.2.0.

32
00:02:02.648 --> 00:02:07.449
So come back over to your page here, and

33
00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:12.835
I'm just gonna create a new terminal here.

34
00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:21.156
And I'm gonna say npm
install react-router-dom.

35
00:02:21.156 --> 00:02:22.482
It's the Windows version, right?

36
00:02:22.482 --> 00:02:24.913
They also have a React Native version and

37
00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:27.649
we only care about the dom
version right now.

38
00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:30.530
@5.2.0.

39
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.970
Okay, so
now we should have react router DOM.

40
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.654
And the first thing I want you to do
is I'm going to go create a new page

41
00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:45.110
called details.

42
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.818
So create a new file in your source
directory called details.js.

43
00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:57.270
This would be if I click on Luna I
wanna see all the details about Luna.

44
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.935
So let me say const details
equals arrow function,

45
00:03:02.935 --> 00:03:08.215
return an h2 of high or
whatever you wanna say.

46
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.325
Here we go, much more appropriate.

47
00:03:17.384 --> 00:03:22.653
And then we're going to export default,
Details.

48
00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:31.667
Okay, so basically the best
react component we've ever made,

49
00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.284
can probably end the course on this,
no, I'm just kidding.

50
00:03:35.284 --> 00:03:36.570
We go back to app.js.

51
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.651
And we're going to import,

52
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:47.440
Details from ./details.

53
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.860
So now we wanna conditionally render,
sometimes SearchParams and

54
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.940
sometimes details.

55
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.580
So we're gonna do that with
the library react router dom.

56
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.788
So we're going to import browser router,
and

57
00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:06.066
I'm just gonna import that as a router,
that's just renamed it to router.

58
00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:13.390
It makes a little bit easier for me to
read and route from react-router-dom.

59
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.574
So now we have two components
here router and route, And

60
00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:28.397
underneath my adopt me I'm gonna put
router, Move SearchParams in there.

61
00:04:32.963 --> 00:04:34.739
And then we're gonna
have two routes in here.

62
00:04:34.739 --> 00:04:38.024
We're gonna have route,
one with path equal being,

63
00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:43.586
/details/:id.

64
00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:49.410
And we're gonna put details in here.

65
00:04:52.224 --> 00:04:57.492
And then we're gonna put route path

66
00:04:57.492 --> 00:05:02.338
= /,
I'm going to put SearchParams in there.

67
00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.985
And mind you,
I also imported details at the top.

68
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.150
So let's get rid of this.

69
00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:19.640
Router and
inside of there I have two routes.

70
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.038
The path = details/:id and path = /.

71
00:05:25.531 --> 00:05:27.630
Let's talk about the :id for a second.

72
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.360
This is how you do variables
inside your routes.

73
00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.398
So something goes to /detail/3,

74
00:05:37.398 --> 00:05:42.690
then that 3 will be passed down
as the 3 property to that route.

75
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.636
So that'll be passed
down here to details so

76
00:05:46.636 --> 00:05:50.170
that it can read that it's on
the three page of details.

77
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.700
So yeah, it's just a variable that
you can read off of your path.

78
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.063
And then this is obviously
the whole homepage to slash.

79
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.682
Okay, so now if we save this and
go over to our page,

80
00:06:06.597 --> 00:06:10.573
Everything is still working
just fine on the homepage.

81
00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:15.352
But here's something curious
if I go to /details/1.

82
00:06:17.463 --> 00:06:20.535
Notice I'm getting both of these.

83
00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:21.260
Why is that?

84
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.630
Technically, it matches both routes and
so because it matches both routes,

85
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.930
it's gonna render both routes.

86
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.808
Let's talk about why.

87
00:06:32.386 --> 00:06:36.605
So when I'm at /details/:id,
it matches both routes, but

88
00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:40.120
when I just /,
it only matches this slash, right?

89
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.430
So if I go back to the homepage,
notice it's empty there.

90
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.560
Let's get into why.

91
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.266
Well, technically, I'm gonna go back
to my notes here for a second so

92
00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:54.220
we can look at this.

93
00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.070
This is how react router
does path matching.

94
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.770
So if I have one that's gonna match,

95
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:12.410
let's take this URL here
/teacher/gem /young.

96
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.207
That's gonna be matched
by /teachers gem and

97
00:07:17.207 --> 00:07:20.040
/teacher/gem/young.

98
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:25.601
And the reason for that is that it matches
as much as it goes from the left in right?

99
00:07:25.601 --> 00:07:30.570
So it's gonna say, does /match/to a point?

100
00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:31.580
And the answer is yes.

101
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.126
And if it matches /teachers,
it does, right,

102
00:07:34.126 --> 00:07:36.910
cuz it matches all the way up to here.

103
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:39.306
As long as it matches all
the way from the left inward,

104
00:07:39.306 --> 00:07:40.860
it's gonna consider it matched.

105
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:46.302
But it likely will not match /young,
right because it doesn't go for

106
00:07:46.302 --> 00:07:48.619
the right, it only goes to the left.

107
00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:50.490
Does that kinda make sense?

108
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.390
It's useful sometimes.

109
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.978
But I actually find it to be
kind of annoying behavior but

110
00:07:55.978 --> 00:07:57.805
that's the way that they designed it.

111
00:07:57.805 --> 00:08:00.075
We can get around that and
I'm gonna show you in just a second, but

112
00:08:00.075 --> 00:08:01.286
I just want you to be aware of that.

113
00:08:01.286 --> 00:08:03.500
You can actually match multiple
routes at the same time.

114
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:07.783
And this you can do this to do
some clever things with it.

115
00:08:07.783 --> 00:08:11.870
Maybe on /teachers,
we can show some special header.

116
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.714
And then we can have some route that only
matches that and then kind of a different

117
00:08:14.714 --> 00:08:17.140
route that matches everything
beneath that, blah, blah, blah.

118
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.716
There's lots of interesting
things you can do with that.

119
00:08:20.965 --> 00:08:22.840
So, let's get around that.

120
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.140
There's another component that we
can import up here called switch.

121
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:33.180
And this is basically saying,
hey, only match one thing.

122
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.270
Only give me the first one and
I don't care about the rest of them.

123
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:45.120
So now I can go switch, And
I can move that up in here.

124
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.661
And now anything that's inside
of the switch basically says,

125
00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:52.317
give me the first one that matches and
that's it.

126
00:08:52.317 --> 00:08:56.698
Because of the order that we chose for
this, this one will match before this one.

127
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:04.907
So now if we go back in here,
notice that this one only renders one

128
00:09:04.907 --> 00:09:09.919
thing, That will match just that.

129
00:09:14.373 --> 00:09:15.274
There you go.

130
00:09:18.423 --> 00:09:20.040
Now there's some other
things you can do here.

131
00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.680
For our intents and purposes,
this is not a react router course.

132
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.106
But you can do 404 pages, you can do
all sorts of fun stuff like that.

133
00:09:28.106 --> 00:09:32.960
Feel free to peruse the react
router documents on your own time.

134
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.640
Suffice to say this is enough for
us to get started.
