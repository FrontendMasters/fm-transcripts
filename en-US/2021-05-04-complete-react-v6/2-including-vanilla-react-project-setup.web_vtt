WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.642
So like I said up front, we are going
to write what I would deem pure react

2
00:00:04.642 --> 00:00:08.400
that there's gonna be no JSX
there's gonna be no build step.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.810
There's no Webpack there's no
parcel none of that stuff.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.030
We're just gonna write directly JavaScript
into an HTML file, which is a great idea.

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.110
And that's why I'm teaching it to you,
it's not that that was sarcasm.

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.507
It's a terrible idea, but
it's a good way for us to get started.

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.258
So, I want you to just create like
a folder somewhere I have one here,

8
00:00:31.258 --> 00:00:33.240
this is just on my desktop.

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.010
I'm gonna create a new folder,
and I'm gonna call this adopt-me,

10
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.910
cuz that's actually the name of
the app we're gonna be writing today,

11
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.473
which is a pet adoption app.

12
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.810
Okay, and then I'm gonna open
adopt-me in Visual Studio Code,

13
00:00:53.214 --> 00:01:00.140
It's fine, okay, and now we have
a brand-new project with nothing in it.

14
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.640
I'm gonna create a new folder in here and
call it SRC.

15
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.825
Why do we call it SRC,

16
00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:11.010
I just always call my source directory
where all my source files are in my SRC?

17
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.983
It's just something I've always done and
I see other people do it and

18
00:01:13.983 --> 00:01:15.070
I have no reason to stop.

19
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.245
Okay, in my SRC directory,
I'm gonna create a new file there and

20
00:01:22.245 --> 00:01:24.860
I'm gonna call that index dot HTML.

21
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.990
Okay, good so far right within HTML
file inside of our source directory.

22
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.840
In Visual Studio Code, you can see HTML,
colon five, just like that.

23
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.400
And I can hit Enter, and
it scaffolds out a basic HTML file for me.

24
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.521
If you're not using VS Code,

25
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.840
you can just go into the course notes and
copy and paste.

26
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.190
But as long as your VS Code is
in HTML mode, that'll work.

27
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.665
You can tell it's an HTML mode
if you see the five of them,

28
00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:02.608
I guess some people won't see a five
little spirits like an HTML symbol though.

29
00:02:02.608 --> 00:02:06.332
Okay, so
if you put a couple of things in there,

30
00:02:06.332 --> 00:02:09.510
the title I'm gonna call mine adopt me.

31
00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.159
You can call your app, whatever you want,

32
00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.926
that's gonna be whatever show
up in the little tab up there.

33
00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:22.220
And then here in the body, I'm gonna
put a div with an ID equal to root.

34
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.170
Call this again, whatever you want.

35
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.010
But this is going to be where react is
going to render itself into right?.

36
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.174
You have to give it kind of like an anchor
point site is to just create an empty div,

37
00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:34.350
and I'll put not rendered here.

38
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.884
So that way I know if I see not rendered
I'll know that react hasn't rendered yet,

39
00:02:38.884 --> 00:02:42.320
right it's because React will
replace whatever is in there.

40
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.935
Okay then I need you to put two Script
tags, and the source of the first one.

41
00:02:52.935 --> 00:03:01.140
And it doesn't matter which one quarter
these come in is http://unpkg unpackage.

42
00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.680
It's from a friend of mine,
it makes a Michael Jackson.

43
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.925
His name is not Michael Jackson's
not that Michael Jackson.

44
00:03:06.925 --> 00:03:15.290
Unpackage.com it allows you to basically
link to NPM packages from the browser.

45
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.529
That's the gist of it, so
we're going to do react at 17.0.1.

46
00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:28.587
So that's the name of the package
that we're going to use,

47
00:03:28.587 --> 00:03:35.517
and then we're gonna do
umd/react.development.js.

48
00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:41.190
And this is gonna load, the React package
from unpackaged into our browser.

49
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.430
I'm sure many of you have
done something similar for

50
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.930
like loading jQuery off the CDN, right?

51
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.018
Okay, so
I need you to make a second pack tag,

52
00:03:53.018 --> 00:03:56.443
you can just copy and paste this top one.

53
00:03:56.443 --> 00:04:00.555
We're gonna change react
here to react-dom, right?

54
00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:08.410
D-o-m, right there, and
then we're gonna change this one as well.

55
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.737
The second one c needs to change
two things in the second line,

56
00:04:13.737 --> 00:04:17.330
react dash do CF react and react DOM.

57
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.140
You need both packages because react
requires two packages to render.

58
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.470
React is like the high level API all
react works relatively the same way.

59
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.197
And then react DOM is actually
the underlying line library that interacts

60
00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:31.800
with the DOM right?

61
00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.660
I'm sure many of you have
heard of React Native, right?

62
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.700
So React Native uses both React and React
Native, that's why you need both of those.

63
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.350
Okay, and now we're getting
into our script tag here, and

64
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.983
we're going to write
some react directly into

65
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.950
Our HTML file, we're going to
put a link tag to a CSS file.

66
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:59.970
So link REL equals stylesheet href
equals style dot CSS, just like that.

67
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.393
I wrote all the CSS for
you for this course so

68
00:05:03.393 --> 00:05:05.010
that you don't have to write any CSS.

69
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.750
For many of you, you're welcome for
others of you, I'm sorry.

70
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.370
Depends on what you
think about writing CSS.

71
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.587
So if you go back to the course
website here is right here

72
00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:20.800
you see that let's add some style and
then click here.

73
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.665
This will take you to all the raw CSS so
you can actually just copy and

74
00:05:26.665 --> 00:05:32.088
paste this directly from there, and
you can put it into your new file here.

75
00:05:32.088 --> 00:05:35.019
Called, style.css.

76
00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:40.706
Style.css start to go on
the source directory.

77
00:05:40.706 --> 00:05:43.928
Why are we not using create react app
here, create react app is great and

78
00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:45.175
when am just doing things.

79
00:05:45.175 --> 00:05:48.495
Things quickly on my own,
I use it quite frequently.

80
00:05:48.495 --> 00:05:52.108
So a create react app does for us,
it basically scaffolds out a ready to go

81
00:05:52.108 --> 00:05:55.835
react app to write with all the tooling
in place and all that kind of stuff.

82
00:05:55.835 --> 00:05:58.971
This circles back to what I was
talking about early earlier.

83
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.955
Which is I want you to understand what
your tools are, why are using them and

84
00:06:02.955 --> 00:06:04.605
how to change them later.

85
00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:08.329
The problem with create react app is it's
like it's very rigid in its structure, and

86
00:06:08.329 --> 00:06:10.340
it hides all the complexity from you.

87
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.346
And I want you to see all the complexity,

88
00:06:12.346 --> 00:06:14.910
I want you to embrace
the complexity of this.

89
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.273
So later, you should definitely use create
react app once you understand what it's

90
00:06:19.273 --> 00:06:20.500
doing for you.

91
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.551
But I want you to basically build your
own create react app for this of course.

92
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.010
So we put in style that CSS, right?

93
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:34.080
Which is a bunch of CSS that I do not
assert is written well, but it does work,

94
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.212
which is probably the most important part
about CSS is that it does work, okay?

95
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.806
So now that we've done that,

96
00:06:43.806 --> 00:06:47.910
what you should be able to do is
you can just do file open here.

97
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.260
File, Open File, and I'm gonna open
it straight off of my desktop.

98
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:59.635
I'm just gonna open it up, next up,
HTML directly in my browser here.

99
00:06:59.635 --> 00:07:01.712
And you should see something like that,

100
00:07:01.712 --> 00:07:05.145
it's gonna say not render because
we haven't done anything yet.

101
00:07:06.195 --> 00:07:09.665
But you see that you should see a nice
background that's coming from the CSS.

102
00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:15.395
And if you go into your console,
so this is just in the terminal,

103
00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:18.150
you'll see that react
is now defined right?

104
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.280
Because this is now being loaded off the
CDN, same thing with react dom like that.

105
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.642
This has always been my favorite, secret
internals do not use or you will be fired.

106
00:07:34.122 --> 00:07:39.113
I guess the story for that people
wanna know is there's internals that

107
00:07:39.113 --> 00:07:43.780
React has and the React team
previously had directly used those.

108
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:48.301
So Facebook.com was using private APIs,
and so they made this thing here that they

109
00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:51.160
said, do not use it or
you will be fired at Facebook.

110
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.388
I don't know if they'll actually be fired,
but

111
00:07:54.388 --> 00:07:56.360
I also probably wouldn't
try if I worked at Facebook
