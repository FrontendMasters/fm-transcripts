00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.364
Hello, welcome to the complete
intro to React Version 6.

2
00:00:03.364 --> 00:00:07.930
My name is Brian Holt, and I'm very
happy that you're joining me for this.

3
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.411
What you see in front of you
on the screen right now,

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:13.430
the Complete Intro to React website,
it's for you, right?

5
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.984
So this is actually my course.

6
00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:17.014
So you notice I have two laptops here.

7
00:00:17.014 --> 00:00:19.330
One of them is just
literally this website up.

8
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.649
So I'm teaching directly
from this website.

9
00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.811
And I open sources and
put it out there for all of you to use, so

10
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:27.307
that you can actually follow along here.

11
00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:29.755
If you fall behind, or
if you wanna copy and

12
00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:33.372
paste the same things that I'm doing,
it's all here for you.

13
00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:35.817
So this is just on my GitHub,
it's open source.

14
00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:40.760
You can also share it for
free to other people, that's totally fine.

15
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.630
Just a little short link to get you here.

16
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.116
If you just do bit.ly/react-6 like this,

17
00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:51.570
this will take you directly there.

18
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.598
Or you can just type this long thing or
you can go to my GitHub,

19
00:00:56.598 --> 00:00:58.960
which is BT Holton,
you can pull it off of there.

20
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.298
So, I'm gonna click into
these little lessons here.

21
00:01:03.298 --> 00:01:06.760
You can see this is all the lessons for
both the Complete Intro to React to V6,

22
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.040
as well as Intermediate React V3.

23
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.691
But let's see, if you click
here on Welcome- Introduction,

24
00:01:11.691 --> 00:01:14.890
notice here in the top,
right it says Welcome- Introduction.

25
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.639
So if you're jumping in different
parts of the video that you can

26
00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:22.666
actually see where I am, the first
part being the name of the lesson,

27
00:01:22.666 --> 00:01:25.110
the second part being the whole section.

28
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.950
So you can kinda reorient
yourself based on that.

29
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.260
There's some great art in here,
that's from Alice Brereton.

30
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.900
So she did great work for this.

31
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.474
And one thing I do wanna highlight right
here that people ask me constantly, so

32
00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:38.680
I just wanna address it upfront.

33
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.869
You don't have to take the previous
versions of this course to get this,

34
00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:42.773
this is a revision.

35
00:01:42.773 --> 00:01:46.160
So this is the sixth revision of this
Complete Intro to React course where we're

36
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.988
always trying to keep it fresh and better.

37
00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:51.057
So you should just watch this one unless
you have a specific reason to watch

38
00:01:51.057 --> 00:01:51.663
an older one.

39
00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:57.310
So, let's talk about
why I made this course.

40
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.480
I've been writing React for
a pretty long time.

41
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.479
I guess we're going on seven years now,
which it's hard for me to believe that

42
00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.656
seven years has gone by since I wrote my
first React course, or first React code.

43
00:02:10.656 --> 00:02:18.070
I launched Reddit's first React code in
July of 2014, which was before it's cool.

44
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.073
I like to tell people, you know how people
say I liked Radiohead before they were

45
00:02:22.073 --> 00:02:24.120
cool, I liked React before it was cool.

46
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.636
Or maybe a better way of putting that is,
I launched React in production before it

47
00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:35.410
was a good idea, which is probably
the more accurate way of putting that.

48
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.308
So the way this course is structured is,
I'm gonna teach you React bare bones,

49
00:02:40.308 --> 00:02:42.429
no tools whatsoever upfront, and

50
00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:47.770
then we're gonna slowly piece by piece
write more code until we hit a problem.

51
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.185
And then we're going to introduce
a tool that solves that problem.

52
00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:54.934
And the reason why I like doing this
is I like for you to see the reason of

53
00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:59.170
why we're using the tools before
we actually start using the tools.

54
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.237
And the reason being for that is just,

55
00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:05.953
if you add tools before you understand the
complexity that they're solving, then you

56
00:03:05.953 --> 00:03:10.630
don't understand why you have the tool and
you start to resent your tools, right?

57
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.743
But if you understand why you're adding
a tool, you start to embrace your tools

58
00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:16.500
because you understand the complexity
that it's removing from you.

59
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.090
So who's this course for?

60
00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.580
This course is for
anyone that wants to learn React better.

61
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.283
That's probably intuitively obvious,
but I expect zero React experience,

62
00:03:27.283 --> 00:03:29.950
I don't expect you to have
ever opened the docs before.

63
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.200
The only thing I'm gonna expect from you
is a little bit of JavaScript experience.

64
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.107
I'm not gonna teach you
JavaScript along the way,

65
00:03:35.107 --> 00:03:38.180
there's other great
Frontend Masters courses for that.

66
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.530
As well as basic how to
open a browser kinda stuff.

67
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.260
I mean, I'll try and
allude to it as we're going along.

68
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.875
But that's kind of the base of experience
that I'm gonna expect from you.

69
00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:54.557
This course has been tested
both on MacOS and Windows.

70
00:03:54.557 --> 00:03:58.690
I can see here I have a Mac and my Windows
laptops, I test everything on both it

71
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.970
should work, no problem, and just by
extension, it'll work fine on Linux.

72
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.436
Some things that you do need to set up
here, you do need to set up Node.js.

73
00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:11.700
I'm gonna ask you to be
on at least version 12.

74
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.522
I'll be honest,
I think it would work on 10, maybe not,

75
00:04:15.522 --> 00:04:19.580
maybe parcel wouldn't work on 10,
be on 12 or over.

76
00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.905
I'll be on 14.9 or something like that.

77
00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:23.623
I'll be on version 14, but

78
00:04:23.623 --> 00:04:26.734
you could probably be on 15
as well if you want to be.

79
00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:28.554
If you don't have it installed,

80
00:04:28.554 --> 00:04:33.610
there's some set of instructions that I
dropped that in the course notes there.

81
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.990
You don't have to use Visual Studio Code.

82
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.149
I work on the Visual Studio Code team, so
I obviously have a reason to tell you to

83
00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:44.610
use it, but I just want you
to recognize that's my bias.

84
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.891
I quite like it, but if you do use Visual
Studio Code during the course of this

85
00:04:47.891 --> 00:04:50.112
workshop, I will teach you
a bunch of cool tricks.

86
00:04:50.112 --> 00:04:51.720
So that's kind of your trade off here.

87
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:59.004
And just to get this out of the way,
people always ask me what's my font or

88
00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:01.280
what's my color scheme.

89
00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.890
So the font that I'm using is Dank Mono,
it's great name for a font.

90
00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.150
That one's not free.

91
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.080
But the one that is free that works just
as well is Microsoft's Cascadia Code.

92
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.270
I quite like that one as well.

93
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.360
I actually use that one in my terminal.

94
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.755
And then I enable ligatures, and
I'll show you one once we're into

95
00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:24.189
Visual Studio Code, but the idea is if
you have a equal signs and an angle

96
00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:27.623
bracket next to each other combines
them into like a fat looking arrow,

97
00:05:27.623 --> 00:05:29.990
it just makes your code
look a little bit cooler.

98
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.464
I just use dark plus,
that's the theme that I use.

99
00:05:33.464 --> 00:05:37.565
It's the default one for VS Code,
I haven't found one that I like

100
00:05:37.565 --> 00:05:42.502
better though I do switch from that to
Sarah Drasner's Night Owl time to time.

101
00:05:42.502 --> 00:05:47.343
I use Mac's built in terminal,
on Windows terminal is great, and

102
00:05:47.343 --> 00:05:52.451
the icons in my VS Code come from
VS Code Icons, which is an extension.

103
00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:56.995
Okay, where to file issues there's a repo
here just click that filed issues open PRS

104
00:05:56.995 --> 00:05:59.020
against that repo.

105
00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.375
That's always great,

106
00:06:00.375 --> 00:06:04.448
cuz I definitely made a bunch of
spelling mistakes in the course notes.

107
00:06:04.448 --> 00:06:07.397
Yeah, I guess who I am a little bit more.

108
00:06:07.397 --> 00:06:09.632
This is my 20th course
on Frontend Masters.

109
00:06:09.632 --> 00:06:11.280
I cannot remember how many
times I've been here.

110
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.235
Somehow they keep letting me in the door.

111
00:06:14.235 --> 00:06:18.896
I work at Microsoft, I work on Azure, I
work on Visual Studio Code, I'm the PM for

112
00:06:18.896 --> 00:06:21.890
JavaScript developer experience for
all of Azure.

113
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.883
I've worked at a bunch of other places,
I've worked at LinkedIn,

114
00:06:28.883 --> 00:06:33.422
Netflix, Reddit,
usually writing React in some capacity.

115
00:06:33.422 --> 00:06:38.780
Other than Seattle,
I like to play games, that kinda stuff.

116
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.220
You can catch up with me
on social media here.

117
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.038
Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, Peloton,
I put all my social links in there,

118
00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:48.900
feel free to add me on all
those social networks.

119
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.636
I am the worst at
responding to DMs though,

120
00:06:50.636 --> 00:06:52.141
just letting you know that upfront.

121
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:56.492
[LAUGH] And one last plea to soothe
my ego, if you can star this repo,

122
00:06:56.492 --> 00:07:00.947
I left you a link there that you can
just go and click the GitHub star.

123
00:07:03.186 --> 00:07:06.960
Okay, so there's two repos for
this course that you need to know about.

124
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.691
There's this website, the website you're
currently on, and then there's another

125
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:15.925
website here called the example projects,
if you go here, you can see here.

126
00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:18.990
These are all the steps that
we're gonna take, right?

127
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.353
So this is gonna be step 1, step 2,
step 3, so that if you get lost,

128
00:07:22.353 --> 00:07:24.634
you can go in and
kinda see the state of the repo.

129
00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:27.687
So if I click on this hooks one, right,

130
00:07:27.687 --> 00:07:32.322
it's just a complete copy of
the repo at that point in time.

131
00:07:32.322 --> 00:07:35.305
So that's for you if you need to copy and
paste code or if you get lost or

132
00:07:35.305 --> 00:07:38.250
if you just wanna restart in
a different area, that's all for you.

133
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.520
And keep in mind as well, there's also
all the intermediate React stuff here.

134
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.280
So 0 or 1 through 12,
that's all for just the intro part.

135
00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.010
Everything else here is for
the intermedia part.
