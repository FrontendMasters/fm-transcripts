00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.083
All right, let's go work on Git.

2
00:00:02.083 --> 00:00:06.757
I imagine most of you are probably pretty
familiar with Git, if not, fantastic

3
00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:11.431
course on front end masters called like
intro to Git or something like that, Git

4
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:16.768
fundamentals from Nina Zakharenko, who's
my co-worker at Microsoft, she's great.

5
00:00:16.768 --> 00:00:20.486
All they want you to do really
is I want you to come into your

6
00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.738
adopt to me directory and
I want you to say Git Nit,

7
00:00:23.738 --> 00:00:26.620
this is gonna make
an empty Git repository.

8
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.593
You should always do this even
if you're not necessarily

9
00:00:28.593 --> 00:00:29.710
planning on putting on GitHub.

10
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.841
It's just a useful thing to
have a Git repository for

11
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:33.300
every project that you're doing.

12
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:42.200
Make sure that's in
the root of your project.

13
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.259
Notice I'm not in the source directory.

14
00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.996
I've done that as well.

15
00:00:45.996 --> 00:00:46.835
You wanna be in the root of your project.

16
00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:49.764
And then the last thing you need to do
here is you need to create a new file,

17
00:00:49.764 --> 00:00:50.690
call it .gitignore.

18
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.985
Again, make sure that you put that dot and
we're just going to put a bunch of files

19
00:00:56.985 --> 00:01:00.490
that we want to ignore for the rest of our
project like node modules is a big one.

20
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.713
And this will improve
performance of In fact,

21
00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:04.880
you can see here says 3k untracked files.

22
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.670
That's because it's tracking
everything in node modules.

23
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.804
Whereas if I save this, and it'll be
significantly faster at some point

24
00:01:12.804 --> 00:01:19.042
it'll sometimes point refresh that,
but we'll start ignoring node modules.

25
00:01:19.042 --> 00:01:20.850
And you can see actually did that wrong.

26
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.999
I put the Git ignore inside
of the source directory.

27
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.896
So, if you did look like me,
you can just drag and

28
00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:29.210
drop it into the root of the directory.

29
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.240
And the now you can see it,
it's only eight.

30
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.079
But again, make sure that your Git
ignore is not in your source directory,

31
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.070
make sure it's in the root of the project.

32
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.870
So we're gonna ignore
node modules dot cash.

33
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.050
That's something that parcel's going
to create for us in just a second.

34
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.070
Dist is where we're going
to build all your files.

35
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.350
You don't want to check in
built files .env .DS_Store,

36
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.840
particularly if you're on a Mac.

37
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.410
Coverage that'll come from testing
.vscode/ we're not checking in our own

38
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.240
VS Code configuration to this.

39
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.250
So those are just a bunch of
good files for you to ignore.
