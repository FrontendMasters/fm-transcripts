00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.084
So first we're gonna add a field here for

2
00:00:03.084 --> 00:00:06.786
is coastal which is going to be a bool,
is coastal.

3
00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:12.650
And this will cause some
other compiler errors.

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.870
Namely, we see that
city is now underlined.

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.682
So it says hey missing
structure fields is coastal.

6
00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:20.095
Yes, absolutely.

7
00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:24.162
Okay well we need to specify that so
I'm gonna say is coastal and

8
00:00:24.162 --> 00:00:27.536
then I could say is coastal
is said to be equal to the is

9
00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:32.369
coastal variable in here but of course if
I want to I can also just leave it off

10
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.871
like that because that's
typically how it's done.

11
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.882
All right, so
now we've got our new city function is

12
00:00:38.882 --> 00:00:43.045
returning the is coastal
value that's passed in here.

13
00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:46.105
We also want this else branch to
do kind of the same thing but,

14
00:00:46.105 --> 00:00:49.525
instead of saying a coastal city
it's gonna say a non coastal city of

15
00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:53.990
approximately same number of residents,
everything else is gonna be duplicated.

16
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.136
So there's probably some way we could make
this, even less code duplication, but

17
00:00:58.136 --> 00:01:01.631
for the purpose of this exercise,
that was the main goal is just to make

18
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:03.960
a note of these city things and
just return it.

19
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.124
Okay, so
now our new city function is done,

20
00:01:08.124 --> 00:01:10.830
we've gotten rid of those two to dos and

21
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.252
our next to do is we want to call new city
here with whatever arguments you like.

22
00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:20.546
So I'm going to call instead of
panic I'm going to say new city and

23
00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.981
it takes residence which is a U64.

24
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm going to give it I don't know,
123 residents and a is it coastal?

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.775
I'll say no, it's not.

26
00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:32.600
Okay, so that's no longer an error.

27
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.542
And here, we're just gonna say this city
can be described as print its description

28
00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:39.910
here and too many.

29
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:45.389
So I'm gonna say rustville.description.

30
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.110
And I can do that because
rustville is a city struct, and

31
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.750
it's just allowed to do that.

32
00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.984
Now notice, by the way, that we have this
residents field here, which is never read,

33
00:01:56.984 --> 00:02:00.000
like we never actually use this
residence thing, we set it but

34
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.860
we never read it anywhere.

35
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.901
So this is just the rust compiler helping
us out a little bit and basically giving

36
00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:09.941
us a little bit of feedback that, hey,
since you've defined this field on your

37
00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:13.950
struct, but you're never actually using
it, maybe you want to get rid of it.

38
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.263
And that's not necessarily a given
that you do, maybe you do or

39
00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:17.340
do not want to do that.

40
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.740
But it is an example of the compiler
sort of helping you out and

41
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.690
letting you know that that's something
you might want to be aware of.

42
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.910
So let's run the program.

43
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.975
Okay, and now you can see we still
got this warning field has never read

44
00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:34.530
residents but that's okay.

45
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.640
Not a big deal.

46
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.611
And now we can see this city can be
described as a non coastal city of

47
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.430
approximately 123 residents
which is coming from there.
