00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.970
All right the format will
be familiar this point.

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.055
So, we've got main and some to dues.

3
00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:09.302
This time, we don't have any other
functions, it's just all inside main, and

4
00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:12.780
basically, we're going to be working
with Vex for the first time.

5
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.045
So, we've got city names, which is our
vac here, and it's got Python Nia Java's,

6
00:00:17.045 --> 00:00:20.201
Berg Sea by the Sea, and
rust Velez as a the names of our cities.

7
00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:22.168
And we're gonna say last city here and

8
00:00:22.168 --> 00:00:27.000
we're gonna use the pop method on the veck
to remove the last city from the list.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.645
As a hint, you might remember that
we learned in the previous section,

10
00:00:30.645 --> 00:00:34.248
that pop actually returns an option
because what if the veck is empty.

11
00:00:34.248 --> 00:00:38.382
It needs to be able to return something so
option is gonna return sorry option is

12
00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:41.391
gonna contain either some or
none depending on whether or

13
00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:45.300
not the value is there, and as a tip,
I put the syntax for that right here.

14
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.600
Then, we're gonna get that last city I'm
going to say last city dot starts with R.

15
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.020
And if it does start with an R,
then we're gonna print line,

16
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.450
this thing starts with R.

17
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.380
Otherwise we're gonna print that
it doesn't start with an R.

18
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.714
Next to do is say okay,
now that we're done printing whether or

19
00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:03.607
not it starts with R,
which was really important,

20
00:01:03.607 --> 00:01:05.780
we really needed to do that,
like immediately.

21
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.530
Now we're going to use dot push to put
that last city back into city names.

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.506
And then finally we're going to print the
entire list of cities by iterating over

23
00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:18.400
the the elements of the veck and
printing them out one at a time.

24
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.220
So this is going to be our first for
loop that we're writing from scratch.
