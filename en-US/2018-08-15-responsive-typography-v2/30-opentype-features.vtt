00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.220
&gt;&gt; Jason: And
again with the OpenType features,

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.500
wanting to make sure
that we make use of this.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.620
Again, we'll take a look at some of
the CSS to play with the kerning and

4
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.450
the ligatures.

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.100
There's even more that you can
do with OpenType features.

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.850
We'll take a look at what
some of those look like.

7
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:26.380
But if you look at this chunk over here
on the right, you've got a nice italic,

8
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.860
and then it's this recipe where you've
got some fractional amounts down there.

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.480
And that's what we've typically
had to do on the web is 1/2, 1/3.

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.610
It's a little coarse,
it doesn't really look quite as refined.

11
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.715
Well, as it happens, in CSS if you
have that series of characters and

12
00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:49.390
you have the OpenType feature enabled,
it can look like that.

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.130
And that's a tremendous difference.

14
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.210
That looks so much nicer where you see
the true fractions that are in there.

15
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.467
We didn't have to add any classes,
just if the typeface finds a 1/2 and

16
00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:08.654
that feature is enabled, it just
replaces it with the proper fraction.

17
00:01:08.654 --> 00:01:12.940
So it's really kind of amazing
that this stuff is all here.

18
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.480
It's been here,
in CSS in the specification for years,

19
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.775
and there just aren't that many
typefaces that support it,

20
00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:25.610
and people don't even
know that it is there.

21
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.358
Axis-Praxis, or another one from my
friend, Roel Nieskens, Wakamai Fondue?

22
00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:36.050
That's another kind of funny one
that I'll pull up in a little bit.

23
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.842
That will sort of open the world to you
for all the available features in a given

24
00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:45.507
type face, and a lot of these things
are set to just work with drag and drop.

25
00:01:45.507 --> 00:01:49.007
So you go there in the browser, you take
your font file, drag it on to the page,

26
00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:51.711
and it will do all the analysis and
then just spit out a page for

27
00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.770
you that tells you everything that's
there that you can play with.

28
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.830
So better blockquotes,
multi column layouts, initial caps.

29
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.722
All of these things fall back
gracefully when they're not supported.

30
00:02:05.722 --> 00:02:10.282
All of these things just kind
of work when you can turn them

31
00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:12.570
on in an automated fashion.

32
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.900
Widowtamer is another thing that we
we'll look at for fixing that last line.

33
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.789
All of these things are what
add up to a great experience.

34
00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:26.423
No one thing is all a sudden going
to make the typography great.

35
00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:29.693
It's all of these little details together,
and

36
00:02:29.693 --> 00:02:34.150
this is the true value with a design
system or a starting point.

37
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.860
So how many of you tend to work
in more of an agency setting or

38
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.480
freelance where you're working on
different projects one after another?

39
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.250
Okay, so we have a few people here.

40
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.160
Are you starting from scratch every time?

41
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.209
I mean, some people have,

42
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.450
a lot of Drupal shops will have
a particular starting theme.

43
00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.960
Lots of people start with Bootstrap or

44
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.710
Foundation, other people
will start with Pattern Lab.

45
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.210
There are lots of different
options out there.

46
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.790
What I recommend is, create your
own typography starting kit, so

47
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.790
that way you can bring all of this
stuff in and it's just all there.

48
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.472
You just bring it into your project and

49
00:03:18.472 --> 00:03:20.688
then you start customizing
some of those values.

50
00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:23.124
And that way, you can fine tune for

51
00:03:23.124 --> 00:03:26.990
the specifics of the typeface
that you're using, but

52
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.300
it also means that you get a jump start
on working on all of these details.

53
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.789
So you're much more likely to have time to
go back and tune up fallback fonts if you

54
00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.972
don't have to write this stuff
from scratch every time.
