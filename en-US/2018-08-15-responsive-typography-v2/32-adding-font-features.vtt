00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.250
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Okay, so the way I
set these pages up in part seven is,

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.410
I've been sort of adding in
some details with each one.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.650
So we'll start with opening up index-01.

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.560
In this one, it's a little basic.

5
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.650
We don't have the shape, we don't really
have a whole lot of differentiation or

6
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.750
scaling going on with the style.

7
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.532
But we do have initial cap,
we have a maximum width on here.

8
00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:32.693
And I wanted to zoom in
on the word flagon, so

9
00:00:32.693 --> 00:00:38.610
we can see that we do not have
any ligatures showing up here.

10
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.565
So let's take a look at that CSS,
and see what's going on.

11
00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:53.122
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So
the things that matter here,

12
00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:57.349
we've got hyphens set to auto,
so we have hyphenation.

13
00:00:57.349 --> 00:01:00.141
But we don't really have anything else,

14
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.140
in terms of refining what's
going on with the paragraphs.

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.527
We don't have any scaling going on,
we just have one set size for

16
00:01:08.527 --> 00:01:12.358
the headings,
nothing's really being added to that.

17
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.440
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: We do have
a couple things in here.

18
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:24.151
So I used the section-end pseudo-element
to add that little section divider.

19
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:28.617
Here's an example of going
into the article-detail,

20
00:01:28.617 --> 00:01:34.899
going to the first paragraph, first line,
that's how we're styling that.

21
00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.837
And so this is coming, the,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: It

22
00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:46.310
should be that first paragraph right here.

23
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.916
But I think, all I did was
change it to a typeface that's

24
00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:55.994
not being loaded, that would be why.

25
00:01:55.994 --> 00:02:00.971
So let's see what happens
when we do font-weight,

26
00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:05.535
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: There we go,

27
00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:10.120
so this is using Plex, so
it's not a variable font in here.

28
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.630
So I can't specify a number,
I just had to use the keyword there.

29
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.950
But that's something that
will automatically work,

30
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.660
even as things re-wrap,
it's only going to select that first line.

31
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.180
So it's a nice little touch that
you can add to highlight something,

32
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.900
without really having to
add anything in overt.

33
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.530
Likewise, we also have article-detail.

34
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.020
Now, I've scoped this to whatever I
have set as the initial paragraph,

35
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.000
so that way,
I can add that class if I want to.

36
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.173
I could just leave it so
that it's only going to get

37
00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:52.872
the first-of-type:first-letter
in that initial first paragraph.

38
00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:58.809
And that lets us do whatever
we want to style that letter.

39
00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:02.519
And we're floating it to the left,
we're setting some padding,

40
00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.970
changing the typeface, setting the font
size, and margin, and line height.

41
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.221
So all of those things
are intended to give us this

42
00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:15.378
effect of getting it
about three stories high.

43
00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:18.349
You can see the alignment isn't
quite what we wanted to be.

44
00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.866
That's something that probably needs
to be fiddled with a little bit, but

45
00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.382
it's all pretty close.

46
00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:27.656
But it's still just not,
it's not really refined,

47
00:03:27.656 --> 00:03:31.380
it's not getting all the niceties
that we might like to see.

48
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.081
So if we take a look at index-02,
you can see,

49
00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:43.240
this is now bringing in the typeface,
it's gone from Plex to Amstelvar.

50
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.450
And if we take a look,

51
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.730
we still don't have the shape wrapping,
we don't really have too much else.

52
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.990
So here with Plex,
the ligatures are on by default.

53
00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.050
So now I can go back, and

54
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:03.900
I can show you what the CSS looks
like to turn those on or off.

55
00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.850
That's what I was trying to find,
to show you, there we go.

56
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.892
See how we have font feature settings,
ligatures and kerning?

57
00:04:13.892 --> 00:04:19.766
So if I,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Inspect this,

58
00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:27.270
I want to be able to show
you this kind of in-line,

59
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.930
so we can see this a little more easily.

60
00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.547
I can disable that, and it's still here,
that's because in the font,

61
00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:41.133
they've encoded it to be on by default.

62
00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:42.863
So instead, what I can do,

63
00:04:42.863 --> 00:04:46.340
if I just didn't want to
have that feature available?

64
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.000
I can force those values to zero, and
see those letters just separated.

65
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.270
So if I toggle that on and off,
you can see the difference.

66
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.360
Some languages don't, like in German,
I guess, they just don't use ligatures.

67
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.570
So there are reasons that you might
want to turn these things on and off.

68
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.370
This has an extended character set that
could be used on a German website,

69
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.420
and it would be inappropriate there.

70
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.042
Because it would be using ligatures where
they are not supposed to be, in German.

71
00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:24.410
So it's important to be able to
know how to control those things.

72
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.692
And this is how,
using font feature settings,

73
00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:28.697
you can force those things to be on or
off.

74
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.607
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So one of
the things that I mentioned earlier,

75
00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:41.573
in terms of discovery, for kind of
figuring out what's available in a given

76
00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:45.792
typeface, and,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

77
00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:50.184
my friend, Roel Nieskens, worked on this,

78
00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:55.049
what I wanted to do was
actually grab one of these.

79
00:05:59.334 --> 00:06:04.820
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: There we go, so
it's done a little quick analysis.

80
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.385
It's all client-side JavaScript, so
your font file isn't going anywhere.

81
00:06:08.385 --> 00:06:12.530
And it lets me know how many characters
there are, how many different glyphs.

82
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.443
How many layout features,
what's the file size, the format?

83
00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:19.295
And it tells me all of these
things that are available,

84
00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.100
these are all OpenType features.

85
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:28.722
So we've got contextual alternates,
we've got fractions,

86
00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:33.621
ligatures, numerals, and ordinals.

87
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:37.202
We've got different kinds of alternates,
stylistic sets.

88
00:06:37.202 --> 00:06:41.618
A whole bunch of things that mean a lot
more to type nerds than they do to normal

89
00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:43.010
people, perhaps.

90
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.918
But they are important for
accessing the full range of characters.

91
00:06:47.918 --> 00:06:52.423
The ones that we might typically
use would be things like kerning,

92
00:06:52.423 --> 00:06:54.199
fractions, ligatures.

93
00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.470
Being able to set the different
kinds of number styles.

94
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.310
So if you're familiar with
seeing numbers that kind of have

95
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.490
an uneven height,
it's called an old-style numeral.

96
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.166
They're meant to mix in
with mixed-case text.

97
00:07:11.166 --> 00:07:15.635
So numbers in-line look a little bit
nicer, when they have almost an upper and

98
00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:18.700
lowercase ascender or
descender kind of alignment.

99
00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:21.960
That doesn't look so great when
you're trying to line up some stuff

100
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.990
in a financial statement, that's
where you might want tabular figures.

101
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.080
Or if you're having things that are,
maybe a stand-alone,

102
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.280
you want lining figures, that all line up,
but they still have proportional spacing.

103
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.923
Tabular figures are great for financials,
because everything will line up,

104
00:07:39.923 --> 00:07:42.183
it's like a monospace for numerals.

105
00:07:42.183 --> 00:07:46.449
Most of these typefaces actually have
all those number styles available.

106
00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:49.915
You can only access them by
using the OpenType features and

107
00:07:49.915 --> 00:07:51.850
font feature settings.

108
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.110
So this one does have a couple
different number styles.

109
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.140
It has a bunch of stylistic alternates,
and fractions, and ligatures, and

110
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.040
stuff like that.

111
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.594
So it's really nice to be
able to have those features,

112
00:08:03.594 --> 00:08:07.943
not all of them will be on or off,
you might not know they're here.

113
00:08:07.943 --> 00:08:11.453
So using a tool like this,
take any typeface,

114
00:08:11.453 --> 00:08:14.243
drag the font file onto the page, and

115
00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:20.350
it gives you a whole slew of information,
of layout features, type tests.

116
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.312
It lets you see what all of
the alternate characters are in here.

117
00:08:24.312 --> 00:08:27.519
Plex was designed to be used
with IBM all over the world, so

118
00:08:27.519 --> 00:08:29.620
it's a very complete character set.

119
00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.785
That's why there's over 700
different characters in

120
00:08:31.785 --> 00:08:34.939
it,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And

121
00:08:34.939 --> 00:08:38.400
all of these things
are pretty easy to access.

122
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.870
So the fractions would be one that
would be useful in what we're doing.

123
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.947
So if we took a look at this page,

124
00:08:45.947 --> 00:08:50.338
and let's take a look at the text.

125
00:08:50.338 --> 00:08:58.716
And go back into,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: index-plex-rwt,

126
00:08:58.716 --> 00:09:02.299
and let's just go to that first paragraph.

127
00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.256
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: We'll say
it's a fragrant 1/2 metaphor.

128
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:19.558
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: If we go back,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And,

129
00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:25.951
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So clearly,

130
00:09:25.951 --> 00:09:31.640
fractions are not on by default, so
let's go take a look at our CSS.

131
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.058
And we go in here and,

132
00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:42.020
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: All we do is add that,

133
00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.030
go back over here.

134
00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:48.680
And because I had browser sync running,
there's our proper fraction.

135
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.640
We didn't have to do anything else to it,

136
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.890
we just needed to know
the feature was there.

137
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:56.451
So this is your best friend if
you're making a recipe website,

138
00:09:56.451 --> 00:09:58.949
or if you simply want
your type to look nice.

139
00:09:58.949 --> 00:10:01.930
So knowing those things
there is half the battle.

140
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.380
And then starting to find each of those
little features, and layer them in,

141
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.646
in a way that lets you build
up this typographic system,

142
00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:11.930
in a way that's sustainable.

143
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:14.776
So imagine this is in a blog,
or WordPress, or Drupal, or

144
00:10:14.776 --> 00:10:16.763
some other content management system.

145
00:10:16.763 --> 00:10:20.696
We're not asking people to add any
classes, just go write a story,

146
00:10:20.696 --> 00:10:21.850
it just works.

147
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.450
The first letter is gonna be a drop-cap,
the first line's gonna be bold.

148
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.020
Any time you put a fraction in there, it's
just gonna get converted automatically.

149
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.437
So it makes it much more sustainable
as a typographic system.

150
00:10:33.437 --> 00:10:39.588
You know that it's going to maintain
its sort of proper look over time.
