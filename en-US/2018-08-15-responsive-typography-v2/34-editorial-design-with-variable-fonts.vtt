00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.680
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So there's one
more example that I wanted to show.

2
00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.390
And this is also one of
the pages that you have in here.

3
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.580
This is, again, trying to get the most
variation out of the typographic system.

4
00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.020
But also think about some editorial and

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.070
art direction that you
might see in a publication.

6
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.157
So looking at this page,
you might think okay,

7
00:00:22.157 --> 00:00:27.677
it's nothing groundbreaking but
sort of a typical outdoorsy,

8
00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:31.779
blog, news media kind of site,
that's fine.

9
00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:39.119
It's nice to load a photo, but
you might have a storyline to go with it.

10
00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:42.209
So you might design it to have
the headline layer over it, and

11
00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:46.024
then put a little bit of a faded drop
shadow on there just to kinda pull it away

12
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.800
from the background a little bit.

13
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.210
Again, it's nothing new here,

14
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.940
every website in the world is
doing something like that.

15
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.360
That's not what they would
do in a magazine though,

16
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.729
in a magazine it might look
a little bit more like this.

17
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.950
But this is a webpage, and
it really wasn't that hard to do.

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.830
So this is just, again,
layering some techniques.

19
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.890
We have the background photo.

20
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.090
I took that photo into Photoshop, and I
just erased the skyline around the rocks,

21
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.960
saved it as a PNG with transparency.

22
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.118
So we have a background photo,
layer of text, and

23
00:01:24.118 --> 00:01:28.079
then the transparent
ground image on top of it.

24
00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.658
Now, obviously file size is a concern, so

25
00:01:30.658 --> 00:01:35.740
you have to be careful how you think about
how you put this stuff into practice.

26
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:44.062
But, watch how it scales.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

27
00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:48.800
you can see this was all done
with two font files to get all of

28
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.529
that variety in the text styles.

29
00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:54.660
And then watch what happens
when that main element scales.

30
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.060
Because they're all three separate
elements, just by scaling the text and

31
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.540
just changing the font
variation properties,

32
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.690
it keeps everything really readable.

33
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.930
But it creates a really nice
editorial effect that's unlike

34
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.660
pretty much anything that you're
gonna see on the web right now.

35
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.340
I've never run across a site
that's doing anything like this.

36
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.670
But you see this in
magazines all the time.

37
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.390
So it's a really nice impact.

38
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.256
You want it to be a sustainable thing, so

39
00:02:23.256 --> 00:02:27.950
two file uploads and a text field,
that's pretty sustainable.

40
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.110
And what designer doesn't
know how to use Photoshop?

41
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.460
That's really all it takes.

42
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.000
So I mean, this is actually something that
I think could really be put to good use.

43
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.370
Again, layering these techniques to
take things past where we are now,

44
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.110
make websites interesting.

45
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.310
Make the design something more
than a bunch of scaling cards.

46
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.820
I think we can do a lot more.

47
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.230
We just really have to stop and

48
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.520
think, how would this work,
then how would it work in a system?

49
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.370
How do we break it down into
components that are sustainable and

50
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.190
easy to use, and
then still give the right control?

51
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.350
So we'd probably want to have some
typographic controls for that headline.

52
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.430
We wanna be able to
differentiate it a little bit.

53
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.160
If you look at a publication and
look at six issues of that publication,

54
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.700
study how they put those
photos together with the text.

55
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.406
They're going to have certain
ways that they go about it.

56
00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:26.541
Different weights, different widths,
different techniques for

57
00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:30.399
shadowing, all of those things
are rules that you can decode.

58
00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.740
Again, it doesn't matter if you
have a design background or not.

59
00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.089
It's just knowing what to look for in type
pairing, in editorial design techniques.

60
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:44.049
You know how to research,
it's just go and take a look,

61
00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.950
see systematically how they go
about doing some of these ideas.

62
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.962
And then,
knowing what you know about CSS Grid,

63
00:03:51.962 --> 00:03:55.270
about variables,
variable fonts, calculations,

64
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.825
what are the different techniques that
you could layer together to create

65
00:03:59.825 --> 00:04:04.624
this much more interesting approach
that's still a sustainable practice?
