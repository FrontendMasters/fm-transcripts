&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So we'll look at
Proportion, again, a little bit.

2
00:00:01.926 --> 00:00:08.890
This article, I mentioned this earlier.

3
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.836
When I wrote this,
it clearly struck a nerve.

4
00:00:12.836 --> 00:00:17.340
This blog post on the Ted cast website,

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.210
at something like 30,000 or
40,000 views in three weeks,

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.565
I was far more popular than anything
I have ever written before or

7
00:00:25.565 --> 00:00:30.380
sense, and it was really focused in
on this notion of how do you create

8
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.410
that modular scale across small screen
to large ones to maintain hierarchy.

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.930
Without compromising the user experience,
and

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.310
line wrap, and
what you can see on the screen.

11
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.360
And what I wanted to make
sure I was focusing in on,

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.750
was getting away from thinking about
this sort of print centric mindset of

13
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.160
what these proportions
always needed to be.

14
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.330
Bear in mind,
Robert Bringhurst wrote a book called,

15
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.070
The Elements of Typographic Style.

16
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.960
That's something of a Bible for designers
in the print world about proportion,

17
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.470
and sort of appropriate typography for
reading.

18
00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.440
It really has to adapt.

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.830
You can't apply those same kind of rules,
when you look at things, so

20
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.980
if we did not adapt that proportion, this
is what that looks like when you don't

21
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:29.940
correct for font size, and headings, and
body copy, when you go down to a phone.

22
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.290
And I think you'll agree that that's not
a particularly good initial experience on

23
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.260
the right, so if that loads up,
and you get three lines of

24
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.540
the actual content that you came here to
read, that's not that great an experience.

25
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.870
But, if we use break points, and we design
things from a mobile first context and

26
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.250
move on up, all we did was just bring
the proportion of the headings down,

27
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.930
and look how much more
content we get on screen.

28
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.750
That's the only thing that we changed.

29
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.490
So when you have fewer elements visible,
you can be more subtle.

30
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.040
That's the main thing to grasp from this,
is on the small screen,

31
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.200
we can be far more subtle,
because there're fewer distractions.

32
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.510
When you get on to the large screen,
there's so much more going on.

33
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.680
That's why headings need to stand out so
much more.

34
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.610
Or if you think about
commercial media sites.

35
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.850
There's so many ads there.

36
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.940
You need all the help you can get
to find the heading for the page.

37
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.260
So this is what it looked like in my book.

38
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.380
This kind of laid everything out,
sort of the print norm, how that

39
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.110
translated to desktop design, different
size of desktop, tablets, phones.

40
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.540
And you can see body copy stays largely
the same, but the headings go from, maybe,

41
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.040
2M or twice the body copy on the phone
all the way up to three times body copy,

42
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.150
and it's a much larger distinction
when you get to that larger screen.

43
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.780
And so, this was sort of meant as
a starting point, and that's where I ended

44
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.210
up using on a lot of projects to just get
a feel for how things might move in scale.

45
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.569
It's gonna vary with typeface, because
they're all slightly different, and

46
00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.750
it's gonna vary with the project, and how
the layout is on large and small screen.

47
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.720
Sometimes, you even want
a greater exaggeration.

48
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.930
You might have four or
five times the body copy for a really,

49
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.640
really big header,
it just really depends on the design,

50
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.410
but this does gives you
a framework to start with.
