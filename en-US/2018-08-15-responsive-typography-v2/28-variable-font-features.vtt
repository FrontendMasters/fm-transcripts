00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:08.680
&gt;&gt; Jason: Before I jump into the next
little section on sort of finessing and

2
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.672
some of the fine details, I wanted
to actually come back to something,

3
00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:18.820
Kim and I were just talking about
which is what I was getting at and

4
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.740
how things are changing over
the next six months or so.

5
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.060
Currently, the CSS specification
is relatively well written for

6
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.870
variable funds but nothing is
anywhere near fully implemented.

7
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.800
So font variation settings is
the low level shorthand for

8
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.810
messing with all of these and
there's, you can,

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.160
you can access any access of
variation you want using that syntax.

10
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.800
But that's not really
the right way to do it.

11
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.240
And we want to set the width
using font stretch.

12
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.400
We want to set the weight
using font weight.

13
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.330
We want to set italic and
slant using the proper tags.

14
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.940
The point being, that a browser that

15
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.700
doesn't understand the variable font will
still understand what that tag means.

16
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.100
We're disrupting the syntax that
we're using to write our CSS,

17
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.780
the least way possible.

18
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.800
And it's just not there yet.

19
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.352
So, I'm gonna pull up one of these pages,
that little sample page that is in.

20
00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:38.600
&gt;&gt; Jason: Let's see, part 4, VF- samples.

21
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.780
So this page is set up to show
the different ways that you might

22
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.080
access these properties
using font weight or

23
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.410
font variation settings and each of
these should be triggered with a hover.

24
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.650
And you'll notice I'm in Chrome right now
and I'm hovering over with font weight and

25
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.060
nothing's happening.

26
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.190
But if I go down to font and
variation settings and

27
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.080
weight, it does exactly what
you think it's supposed to do.

28
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.089
And then if we go with font stretch
with the number, nothing happens.

29
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.250
Font variation settings with width,
it does what it's supposed to do.

30
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.336
So that's in Chrome and
if I take the same thing and

31
00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:23.382
go over Safari,
&gt;&gt; Jason: You'll

32
00:02:23.382 --> 00:02:25.180
notice font weight is working.

33
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.770
It's fully implemented there in
addition to font variation settings.

34
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.940
So, these are some of
the pitfalls right now in that

35
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.640
font variation settings is implemented
fairly evenly across the board but

36
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.190
the proper CSS attributes
are not evenly implemented and

37
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.240
the danger here is that we all fall
into using that lower level syntax,

38
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.479
rather than the proper CSS attributes.

39
00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.780
It will work but
it starts to break the model.

40
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.890
It starts to break down
the way we write our CSS.

41
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.910
And so, if we're not accessing it
with font weight, it's harder for

42
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.050
us to then scope it for whether or
not the variable font's actually working

43
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.240
because we've gotta rewrite
a whole lot more CSS.

44
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.010
So, this is why I'm trying
to let people know that yes,

45
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.750
you can do things with font variation
settings but over the next few months,

46
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.680
things are going to be evolving and
changing and we really wanna

47
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.260
keep the pressure on the browser vendors
themselves, to implement things fully.

48
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.790
Because we have a little cautionary
tale with font feature settings.

49
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.360
Has anybody ever used those before?

50
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.829
That's how you would access some of
the OpenType features that I talk about.

51
00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.917
I'll show you some of that CSS looks
like and the reason that this is so

52
00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:48.566
important is that font feature
setting was a similar low levels

53
00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:53.630
syntax to turn on and off kerning,
turn on and off ligatures.

54
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.600
Different figure styles, fractions,

55
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.555
all of these other little things that you
can access with a good OpenType font.

56
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.340
We were supposed to have
font variant kerning and

57
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.110
a whole bunch of other things that
were supposed to be implemented,

58
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.760
in order to access turning on and
off ligatures and different number styles.

59
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.160
The CSS spec is written but because
nobody was really making use of them,

60
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.270
the browser vendors never prioritized
actually fully implementing these things,

61
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.840
so it never got done.

62
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.580
So it's still kind of hanging out there.

63
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:34.660
There's a lot of
unimplemented CSS specs for

64
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.740
text and proper typography,
that has never been fully implemented.

65
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.880
Another one that is kind of a nice one is

66
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.476
having a text decoration that
you can specify ink skip.

67
00:04:47.476 --> 00:04:51.870
Meaning that has the browser,
the underline for a link is drawn,

68
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.900
that it skips the descenders and
doesn't draw a line through it.

69
00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.610
If you look at a link in Safari or
on IOS, you'll notice that it's

70
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.360
a nice delicate underline that skips the
descenders, it has little break around it.

71
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.210
It looks really refined and
you'll look at it in any other browser,

72
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.050
it's just this big heavy line
that's drawn underneath it.

73
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.640
So we're supposed to have the ability
to specify that ink skip and also,

74
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.650
eventually, the weight of the line.

75
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.490
So it would be really nice to be able
to have a little bit more control

76
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.160
over the way links are defined.

77
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.250
And that's just another example.

78
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.750
So, I try and stress this, so
that as we start working with this and

79
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.840
everybody has access to those links on
GitHub, that people can weigh in and

80
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.710
they can find those pages to vote for
these features.

81
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.790
It took a long time to get
hyphenation in Chrome.

82
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.800
But it was because hundreds
of people went and

83
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.900
weighed in on this issue on
GitHub in the bug tracker for

84
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.900
the Chrome Dev team to say hey, we really
need this because they got halfway there.

85
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.380
It was another thing that
kinda people lost interest or

86
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.279
lost momentum where they implemented
hyphenation but no hyphenation dictionary.

87
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.545
So it just didn't work.

88
00:06:07.545 --> 00:06:09.450
And hyphenation is
a really important tool.

89
00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.286
Especially on narrower screens in order
to have a somewhat better line wrap.

90
00:06:15.286 --> 00:06:20.686
So, it's important to note, these things
are here, they're suppose to work,

91
00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:24.618
either with font variation settings or
with font stretch.

92
00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:28.928
You can see font stretch is not doing
what it's supposed to be doing,

93
00:06:28.928 --> 00:06:30.940
here in this browser.

94
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.750
But it's using it with
font variation settings.

95
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.600
So, some things are implemented,
some things are not.

96
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.870
You can see slant is working great.

97
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.640
It sort of works here but
you can't animate it.

98
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.990
So that was kind of
an interesting difference.

99
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.890
And so, we can get the oblique 20 degrees
but we can't animate it smoothly.

100
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.118
We need font variation
settings to do that.

101
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.500
&gt;&gt; Jason: That's how x are doing
what they're supposed to be doing.

102
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.400
Optical sizing is working pretty well.

103
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.020
So, this font sample page, so
VF samples in part four, just

104
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.610
has them all individually and you can look
at the corresponding CSS, so that you can

105
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.530
get a better sense of how each of these
things would be implemented specifically.

106
00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:25.497
So if we go and take a look at that file.

107
00:07:36.608 --> 00:07:39.411
&gt;&gt; Jason: So,
I try to sort of specify each one

108
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:42.610
with a sort of readable class name.

109
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.740
So demo wait.

110
00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.580
There's all your font
variation settings and

111
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.120
when it's on hover, it changes the values.

112
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.810
So, you can get a sense now.

113
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:57.932
This is with that has a whole lot
of things that you can change.

114
00:07:57.932 --> 00:08:02.951
I'm only changing a few but
you can also see how each of them

115
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:08.074
behaves specifically and
if we scroll down there is grade,

116
00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:13.707
so you can see how that can
things up without reflowing and

117
00:08:13.707 --> 00:08:18.009
the ascenders and
the descenders is kind of fun and

118
00:08:18.009 --> 00:08:22.115
of course this one
&gt;&gt; Jason: So

119
00:08:22.115 --> 00:08:25.680
these are basically all of the little
demos that were in the slides.

120
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.887
All the code is here, so
you can play with any one of these.
