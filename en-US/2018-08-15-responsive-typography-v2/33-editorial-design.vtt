00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: One more
section that I wanna go through.

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.247
And this is really looking at
the idea of art direction and

3
00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:13.908
looking at a couple of these example
pages and how some of those things work.

4
00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:17.235
And then I'd like to spend some time
looking at some real projects with you.

5
00:00:32.053 --> 00:00:33.418
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So I think all of

6
00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:39.450
the things that we can do with
variable fonts and typography.

7
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.090
Up to this point are better ways of
doing the things that we've been doing.

8
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.370
Some of them are pretty significant,
I'm not sure it's really transformational

9
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.890
except for the fact that we get to access
a much broader range of the design space.

10
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.380
Because we don't have to worry about
only loading two or three files.

11
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.920
So I think it's better, but

12
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.250
I'm not sure that it's really rising to
level of like revolutionizing design, and

13
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.020
I do think that the potential with
variable funds is to do just that.

14
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.930
But that means we have to think
a little bit further outside

15
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.070
our typical world of web
design because I've even seen

16
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.450
the former design director from Vox Media
say to me why do we need variable fonts

17
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.100
because we don't design with more than
three or four weights in the first place.

18
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.720
Well, you only design with three or

19
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.390
four weights of a typeface
if that's all you're given.

20
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.800
Left up to our own devices,
designers are going to

21
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.900
use a much broader range because
it's more appropriate to the design.

22
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.460
It's more readable, it's more clear,
it adds greater emphasis where we want it.

23
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.865
We have been constrained and

24
00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:02.680
we've then let those constraints
define the way we think about design.

25
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.050
Even for somebody in a position at
a major media company who should

26
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.970
absolutely know better.

27
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.770
And that was really disappointing to me,
but it was also really significant because

28
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.090
I've had a similar comment
from a type designer.

29
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.507
And that really threw me.

30
00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:21.438
Why would a type designer who is,
their business is making this

31
00:02:21.438 --> 00:02:26.274
whole range of type for
people to work with still fall victim to

32
00:02:26.274 --> 00:02:30.850
that same trap of thinking
that's what normal should be.

33
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.380
That just happens to be what is.

34
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.070
So I think the true revolution
is actually getting past that

35
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.380
looking at what we've been doing in
print and what's been so effective.

36
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.650
And then, thinking about how we
might do these things on the web and

37
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.260
take it into a whole new place.

38
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.935
So some of those things that I really
like about Amstelvar with these

39
00:02:52.935 --> 00:02:57.938
extra access for ascender height and
descender height, being able to do

40
00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:03.041
things like avoid that simply by
tweaking the ascenders and descenders.

41
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.664
So I want that heavy, thick, setting,

42
00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:10.834
having that really solid set to make that
headline really have a lot of weight and

43
00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:14.820
presence, I just don't want
those ugly collisions.

44
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.310
It gives me the perfect way to
handle situations like that.

45
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.860
We can also very easily do
things like create a little poll

46
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.820
quote builder that allows
people to highlight words,

47
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.450
change the weight or the width,
have it all wrapped in viewport units.

48
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.180
So that even when it scales, it actually
preserves that same kind of relationship,

49
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.360
but makes it appropriate for
the size of the screen.

50
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.940
So again, that's just layering techniques.

51
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.760
It's used in the variable font.

52
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.540
Making it easy for people to highlight and
just tweak a few things here and

53
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.750
there, wrap the whole thing using
viewport units so it all scales together.

54
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.590
Now, again, the key there is we're aligned
on the relative sizing of Ams, but

55
00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:05.142
then setting a container using the
viewport units so all those things scale

56
00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:10.000
relative to each other.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: I

57
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.443
wanna talk about media.

58
00:04:12.443 --> 00:04:17.401
I wanna talk about newspapers
because I think we're at a point

59
00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:22.490
in time where there's a real
shift in how any of us get news.

60
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.510
How many people get an actual paper
newspaper delivered to their house

61
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.310
or apartment?

62
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.740
I get one on Sundays, that's it.

63
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.110
And one out of three or four weeks,

64
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.910
we actually spend time opening up more
than one section to really look at.

65
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.880
That's not how we get our news.

66
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.840
We get it online.

67
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.830
The problem is we've grown up being
a constant to the news having

68
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.990
a voice from a particular publication
that we come to know and trust.

69
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.020
So we have visual cues that start to
become engrained in our own brains

70
00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.980
about what does authentic news look like.

71
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.960
Because that's how our brains work.

72
00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.810
We associate aesthetics and

73
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.725
familiar visuals as a strong tie to
authenticity and trustworthiness.

74
00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:16.911
That's just how we work.

75
00:05:16.911 --> 00:05:19.859
It's not guess work, it's not psychology,

76
00:05:19.859 --> 00:05:23.419
it's just kinda how brains function and
that's fine.

77
00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.512
But that means we're losing an opportunity
when you look at their website now,

78
00:05:28.512 --> 00:05:30.039
and it looks like this.

79
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.590
There's a real difference in hierarchy.

80
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.670
Look at all the different levels of
typographic hierarchy on that page

81
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.800
guiding your eye around, telling you
what's the most important story,

82
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.980
what's the next most important story.

83
00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:48.520
There's a tremendous amount of thought
that goes into presenting that.

84
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.680
Online, there are exactly two
different heading styles, that's it.

85
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.975
And if I hadn't cut the ad out of this and
brought the content back up,

86
00:05:58.975 --> 00:06:02.372
you would have seen
that top level heading.

87
00:06:02.372 --> 00:06:05.250
The h1 completely buried off the screen.

88
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:07.990
They're lead story, gone.

89
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.230
Now how do they typically deal with
the lead story when it's a really like

90
00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.710
a headline like that in print

91
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.930
would have been plastered all the way
across right under the masthead?

92
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.130
That's how they would
handle that in print.

93
00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.420
It would be big, it would be copy
fit right edge to edge across

94
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.320
the masthead of that page, so
that you knew this was a big deal.

95
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.610
And we don't have any facility to do that,
because on the web

96
00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.890
we have optimized around any
content any time, all the time.

97
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.470
So we do the design,
we fit any content in it.

98
00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.280
And we've created this circumstance
where we have no ability

99
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.060
to actually give voice
to a specific story.

100
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.240
Well, this is, again, the kinda thing
where variable fonts could come in to

101
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.240
play, built some type setting tools and
do the content management system.

102
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.630
Allow people to say,
I wanna do something for this headline.

103
00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.520
Yes, we have a design system for
nine out of ten stories, but

104
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.260
that tenth story's a big deal and I really
wanna make sure that people don't miss it.

105
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.750
So I would like to do something specific.

106
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.470
So I made a little demo,
this is actually using Amstelvar.

107
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.084
So I was able to tweak Amstelvar to
actually look pretty close to what they

108
00:07:20.084 --> 00:07:22.560
actually use in their print publication.

109
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.700
Played around with width, played around
with stroke contrast, optical sizing,

110
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.580
the serifs themselves a little bit and
then I used CSS grid and a viewport units.

111
00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:37.920
So I created a layout that gives
a little bit more flexibility in

112
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.100
how you assemble things.

113
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.790
And so I would like to add

114
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.600
this element here that's going to be
spanning across these three grid columns.

115
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.460
That's my headline.

116
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.420
These things are gonna stack below.

117
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.156
And it actually moves and
scales pretty nicely.

118
00:07:53.156 --> 00:07:57.220
And still kinda maintains that
feeling of the print publication

119
00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:00.640
without really sacrificing
the ability to maintain it.

120
00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.430
So it's all still things that can be
relatively easily built into a content

121
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.650
management system.

122
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.127
It just requires a little bit
of rethinking about the content

123
00:08:10.127 --> 00:08:14.867
assembly process which a lot of
people are already working on and

124
00:08:14.867 --> 00:08:19.253
then adding in a few other tools
to specify a piece of text and

125
00:08:19.253 --> 00:08:22.941
then tie into tweaking
those variations values so

126
00:08:22.941 --> 00:08:26.749
that you can fix something
in the way you want it to.

127
00:08:26.749 --> 00:08:30.580
This is the demo that
actually build on Drupal.

128
00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:35.931
So this is something that
I know can actually work.

129
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:39.024
So a couple people have
worked with Drupal in here.

130
00:08:39.024 --> 00:08:42.510
Somebody worked with
the paragraphs module in Drupal?

131
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:47.150
So it's sort of a familiar
concept in a lot of

132
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:49.390
different content management systems now.

133
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.220
It's the ability to define
a bundle of content.

134
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:57.350
So in this case, the ability to create
a component that can have one or

135
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.350
more lines of text in it.

136
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:04.040
And what I ended up doing was, defining
that line of text as variable font line

137
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.580
with the ability to supply the text,
to choose one or

138
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:11.640
more variable fonts that
I added into the theme.

139
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.970
And then little sliders that's
just an HTML range input.

140
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:19.966
Nothing fancy there that allows you
to tweak the font size, the slant,

141
00:09:19.966 --> 00:09:24.940
font weight, crank that all the way over
just hit Save and you end up with that.

142
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.700
So this was a really
simple test just to see

143
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:33.430
how easy you could make this
from a publishing perspective.

144
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:39.140
No code is required and it's easy for
someone to build up those lines of text.

145
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.620
Same concept could be applied to
type setting the title itself.

146
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:48.220
So there's really no reason why we
can't actually start to build some of

147
00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.030
these controls to create far
greater editorial control.

148
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:57.400
And we can still gate it, we don't
have to give those tools to everybody.

149
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.240
Every content management system
allows you to define roles.

150
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.210
You can define a designer role and

151
00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.350
only give those tools access to
people that know how to use them.

152
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.000
So we can actually get back to the way
we've been designing, really for

153
00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.640
decades where someone writes the content,
somebody edits the content and

154
00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.650
makes the decision about where it should
go, and then a designer lays it out.

155
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:26.340
In this way, the designer can still
think about what they wanna do,

156
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.080
they're not stuck writing code,
you're not breaking the system.

157
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.890
If the variable fonts don't load or none
of the CSS is put into play, who cares,

158
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.870
it's still gonna fall back to
exactly what you had before.

159
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.400
So this is still a really easy and
portable solution.

160
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.330
It's not messing with
the semantics of the code.

161
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:47.190
But it's creating a much more refined and

162
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:52.280
elevated way of getting that point
across to create a more unique voice.

163
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:58.800
So one of the challenges that
people have talked about, and

164
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.390
I think there's some validity to it,
is sliders are not always the answer.

165
00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:10.965
So when you have these input element I
want to play with this weight, this width.

166
00:11:10.965 --> 00:11:14.496
Always having a slider
is a little bit coarser,

167
00:11:14.496 --> 00:11:18.204
also you're interacting
with something here and

168
00:11:18.204 --> 00:11:23.234
looking at the text over here that
can be a little bit of a mental model

169
00:11:23.234 --> 00:11:29.350
challenge that makes it a little harder
for people to really get what's going on.

170
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:32.360
Direct manipulation might
be a little bit easier.

171
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.980
And that's something that these two folks,
Hosea and

172
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.510
Sahara, demonstrated in type of
labs in Berlin back in April.

173
00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:47.865
If you see the highlighted red blocks,
it's a strap called the cashida,

174
00:11:47.865 --> 00:11:53.330
I hope I'm getting that right,
in Arabic, that's a connecting stroke.

175
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:57.550
And it's very often made longer or
shorter to indicate pacing.

176
00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.420
So a longer stroke might indicate
a pause between phrasing.

177
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.940
And then what they've done is
actually built an interface

178
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.770
that is an access of variation.

179
00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.990
And that little red box is
something you can click and drag.

180
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.910
And if they wanna justify the type in
that block, they can go to anyone of

181
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:18.700
those red blocks, and just drag it to
make that stroke longer or shorter.

182
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:22.330
Direct manipulation of
the variation access,

183
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.910
I thought that was really interesting so
you think about that

184
00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.400
if we built an interface like that for
other aspects.

185
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.620
You see the headline and
you wanna make a little bit narrow,

186
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:39.970
where you can just go and click on
the letters and drag it in a little bit.

187
00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.710
You're like directly manipulate that text.

188
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.680
I think there's some really
interesting possibilities there.

189
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.760
So I'm not really sure where that's gonna
go, and that's kinda what I think is

190
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.240
exciting about this time right now,
is that we have some of these raw tools.

191
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.490
We have the web, we have JavaScript.

192
00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:01.960
We have these tools available
to us to twist and play and

193
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.120
prototype and see what works.

194
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.480
That's why I think not only do we have the
ability to do some of the best typography

195
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.700
available, we also have
the ability to build the tools

196
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.060
without having to go through this
lengthy software development process.

197
00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:22.070
That Axis-Praxis website that I showed
you, that was put together by my friend

198
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.250
Laurence because he wanted
to play with variable fonts.

199
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.540
So he wrote some JavaScript and
he put this thing together, and

200
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.340
it's grown over time.

201
00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.860
So the same thing is true with
[INAUDIBLE] website, [INAUDIBLE].

202
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.570
That was put together because he wanted
to find a way to understand what's

203
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:44.710
inside a font so that he didn't have to
go to a bunch of other different tools.

204
00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.750
This is a time of discovery and

205
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.810
experimentation that's
wide open to all of us.

206
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.220
If you know how to make
something in JavaScript,

207
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:54.980
you can manipulate these values.

208
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.380
And we can create any
kinda interface we want.

209
00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.840
We need to experiment and
see what really works.

210
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.490
Being able to drag and
directly manipulate,

211
00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:04.869
like imagine if there's an x-height.

212
00:14:04.869 --> 00:14:07.890
Cj Dun has a typeface called Dunbar.

213
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:10.570
I actually used that in
a lot of the slides.

214
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:13.610
And he has an x-height variation.

215
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.460
So the height of the lower case letters.

216
00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:19.970
And imagine if you can just click and
drag on a little red line like raises and

217
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:23.488
lowers the x-height instead of having
to go play with the slider, so

218
00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:27.640
you can actually just nudge it to
be exactly what you want it to be.

219
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.550
I think it's a really interesting,

220
00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.000
really exciting time to be able to
play around with some of these things.
