00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.370
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: I just wanted to put
this up again just as a reminder of

2
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.590
this as a useful tool to figure
out what your font can do.

3
00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.920
It doesn't have to be a variable font.

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.120
So any kind of font that you want to work
with, if you want to see if they're open

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.700
type features, any of those things,
you can just drag and drop on there.

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.183
And it'll analyze it for you and
give you a good low down on what's there.

7
00:00:27.183 --> 00:00:33.531
Axis-Praxis is another one that I go
to all the time to test things out and

8
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:38.840
also because you can drag and
drop a font here as well.

9
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.990
And then access it and
turn features on and off.

10
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.000
So with this selected this text
block here, it automatically says,

11
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.250
it's Voto Serif and
it gives me the different sliders here and

12
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.250
it also tells me what
Open Type features are here.

13
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.680
So we've got fractions, so
we can just go ahead and

14
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.340
type in here and then we can
see they are not on by default.

15
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.080
But we can turn them on or
force them off or leave it standard.

16
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.110
Same thing is true with ligatures or
anything else that you see here.

17
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.901
So those are really helpful
things to kind of start to

18
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:23.617
get an understanding of
what you have to work with.

19
00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:27.690
And what you have available
to you at a given time.

20
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.640
You can also then kinda play around
with tight pairings here pretty easily.

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.460
So you can do things like change
the type face that is in use.

22
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.780
In some of these different, excuse me,

23
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.010
different blocks to see
how things look together.

24
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.790
I wouldn't say it's necessarily
the most robust type setting platform.

25
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.833
But it does let you very quickly play
around with stuff and just kind of knock

26
00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:59.570
things together and sort of prototype
your typography a little bit.

27
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.015
And it's really easy to use, and
you can always get that CSS,

28
00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:09.440
you can edit the values here and
reapply it.

29
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.172
But it makes it real easy to poke around
with things and copy those resources, and

30
00:02:14.172 --> 00:02:16.408
take them back into your own project.

31
00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:23.762
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: I wanted to show you
a few of the other variable fonts, and

32
00:02:23.762 --> 00:02:26.980
kind of what's interesting about them.

33
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.880
So you can see what's some of
the other things are available.

34
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.267
So David Jonathan Ross has been playing
around with colored fonts as well.

35
00:02:33.267 --> 00:02:37.220
And it's got some really
incredible things that you can do.

36
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.250
That's another one of those things that's
not terribly well supported in browsers

37
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.350
just yet, but you can see a lot
of interesting things are coming.

38
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.382
Being able to, once it's fully supported,
actually specify and

39
00:02:49.382 --> 00:02:52.845
change any of the colors that
are available in that font.

40
00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:57.586
But you can kind of see what you can do
to play around with the thickness and

41
00:02:57.586 --> 00:03:02.590
thinness of the interior stroke weight,
as well as the serifs themselves.

42
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.420
Roslindale is the one that I've been
working with on my own site, and

43
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.600
that's actually what I used
in a lot of my slides.

44
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.836
And you can see this one can actually
work pretty nicely as a text face, or

45
00:03:15.836 --> 00:03:19.526
as something that's a little bit
heavier to use for headings.

46
00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:26.380
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So FF Meta was
the one that I used in another project.

47
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.928
You can see all the way from
a really super light hairline,

48
00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:31.008
all the way up to something
really super heavy.

49
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:35.434
But some of the more interesting ones have

50
00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:39.990
several other axes that you can play with.

51
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.051
And once you get into some of those
differences, I would like us to

52
00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:50.306
find one here that offers, okay,
here's a little more crazy one.

53
00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:53.639
You can set the wind
direction on this one, so

54
00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.233
again, like the axis,
it can really be a lot of,

55
00:03:57.233 --> 00:04:03.140
really can be kind of anything that the
type designer wants to play around with.

56
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.410
And because this is all regular text,
you're not really sacrificing

57
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.240
the readability for
somebody with assisstive devices.

58
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.202
You're just adding to the design.

59
00:04:16.202 --> 00:04:21.517
Barlow's an interesting
one in that this one has

60
00:04:21.517 --> 00:04:27.530
started to gain a lot of
popularity on Google fonts.

61
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.040
It's a pretty nice type face.

62
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.280
It's pretty versatile.

63
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.923
It's got a width and a weight axis and

64
00:04:32.923 --> 00:04:37.793
it's got the numbering as a little
bit weird, but, that's okay.

65
00:04:37.793 --> 00:04:42.485
And so the standard version is
available on Google Web Fonts, but

66
00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:44.970
it's an open-source typeface.

67
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.757
You can download it from GitHub and
you can make a variable font out of it if

68
00:04:49.757 --> 00:04:53.541
you have the right tools and
really do quite a lot with it.

69
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:56.661
I'm not exactly sure
what time of day is here,

70
00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:59.222
but that's what they want to call it.

71
00:05:07.345 --> 00:05:12.006
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So
just wanna make sure that you can see that

72
00:05:12.006 --> 00:05:16.810
it's not just for standard use typefaces.

73
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.570
You might have really
interesting calligraphic effects

74
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.960
that you can get just by
playing around with these.

75
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.630
So you can imagine that as a heading,
like on a clothing website, and

76
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.340
there's all different kinds of brands that
might be kind of an interesting effect.

77
00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:41.250
Where you would vary the weight and
the swashes to really get a beautifully

78
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.310
sort of drawn effect on that when
the screen loads in in the first place.

79
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.270
So a lot of it is not necessarily how
you use it just in a static sense,

80
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.840
but because all these
things can be animated,

81
00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.040
it actually can provide something
that moves and changes over time.

82
00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.940
So as it loads and then it does something,

83
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.740
it gives you an opportunity to create
some really interesting effects.

84
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.690
So this is Bahnschrift, this is one
that actually ships in Windows 10.

85
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.680
And before they added the width
axis this thing was only 26K,

86
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.230
I mean, that's really incredible.

87
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.270
That's the size of like pretty
much any other standard font, but

88
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.440
it had a width from 300 to 700 and

89
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.230
a character set that's complete enough
to build into an operating system.

90
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.020
So I mean this was not a lightweight,
half-baked kind of thing.

91
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.253
This is a really well-engineered typeface.

92
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.956
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So this is the crazy
of deck of ours, so I showed you one,

93
00:06:46.956 --> 00:06:49.860
I do not even remember which one it was.

94
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.900
But this is just kind of a technology
demo where you can see this actually goes

95
00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.950
from a serif to a sans serif, but
it changes the shape of the serifs.

96
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.830
You can have an inline stroke,

97
00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.029
change the terminal shape,
the worm effect, whatever that is.

98
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.870
Flare things quite a bit more, so there's
a tremendous amount of variability.

99
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:24.060
And one of the reasons I like to show
this is think about people with dyslexia,

100
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.620
think about the challenges that they
face differentiating between characters.

101
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:33.400
And when everybody's using something
like Open Sans that has really somewhat

102
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.820
nondescript characters being able to do
something like subtly shape the terminals.

103
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.560
Or the tops of the ascenders or

104
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.160
descenders to make the B ad D
slightly more differentiated.

105
00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.560
That's an accessibility switch
that would make night and

106
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.180
day difference to somebody with that
kind of reading comprehension issue.

107
00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.690
So there's a difference between
being able to use something and not.

108
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.809
So I think that's another one of
the potential uses of variable fonts,

109
00:07:59.809 --> 00:08:02.497
is to put more control on
the hands of the user.

110
00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:07.476
Now, it is a challenging notion
because that means giving up more

111
00:08:07.476 --> 00:08:11.200
control as a designer,
but in a controlled way.

112
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.860
So you're defining the space, you're
giving people the controls to use, and

113
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.400
you're allowing them to have
some flexibility in how

114
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.270
they take in that content.

115
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:26.330
It's not so different than having to
deal with different length headings.

116
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:30.400
Again, we have to give up a little
bit of the explicit control

117
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.440
to give people a more
define way to interact

118
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.840
because ultimately our job is to
help them get to that content.

119
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.430
So again, anything that we
can do to make that easier,

120
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.560
whether it's increasing
the grade of the text,

121
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.820
allowing them to change the shape
of the letters a little bit.

122
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:51.960
Or for people that suffer from crowding,
which is a subset of people with dyslexia.

123
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.320
Microsoft research found that if
you increase the line height and

124
00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:00.110
the word spacing, you could increase
reading comprehension by 50% for

125
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:02.320
people with that condition.

126
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.790
That's all standard CSS.

127
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.903
So that's a button somebody could push
to completely change the way they could

128
00:09:06.903 --> 00:09:08.440
interact with that content.

129
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.340
And again, make the difference
between a child learning and not.

130
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.979
That's really powerful, that's stuff
we can do with design, with CSS,

131
00:09:15.979 --> 00:09:19.401
with these variable fonts,
things that were never before possible.

132
00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:25.063
That's why I really like just being in
this time of experimentation to see

133
00:09:25.063 --> 00:09:32.320
what's possible and just having all these
things to play with is really tremendous.

134
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.220
I did just gloss over the poop emoji.

135
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.920
This was a demonstration of a color font.

136
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.380
Actually, by my friend Rule that made that
other bot website that we were looking at.

137
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.900
So here's Amstalvar.

138
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.220
And here are all the different axis.

139
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.590
So this is the one that's in many of
the demos that we have to play with and

140
00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.450
you can see it's got
the standard sort of width and

141
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:57.110
weight stuff that's
interesting to play with.

142
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.700
But the optical size you can see
the extreme differences that

143
00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:02.980
you can achieve with that.

144
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.030
So that's useful for physical size but
it's also useful for

145
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.130
just changing the nature of
the character of the font.

146
00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:14.500
So if you don't really
want that fine detail,

147
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.450
you can just force the optical size using
font variation settings to set it to

148
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:24.720
a specific value if you would really
prefer to have that heavier effect.

149
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.590
And that's just fine,
it's totally up to you.

150
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.360
But there's fun things that you can do
to change the shape of the serifs, so

151
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.180
you can see how that's kind of moving and
changing.

152
00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.330
Sort of changes the effect of it.

153
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.498
Now,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Following along

154
00:10:43.498 --> 00:10:47.084
with why transparent and why opaque and

155
00:10:47.084 --> 00:10:52.380
etcetera mean,
is a little bit kind of hard to follow.

156
00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:57.710
But you can see there is like the change
in the heights of the ascenders and

157
00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.510
the descenders.

158
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.240
So you can play around with
things visually, but also

159
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.970
in terms of copy fitting and type setting,
that gives you a lot to play with.

160
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:10.199
And,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Also separately

161
00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:13.065
the height of the upper case letters, so

162
00:11:13.065 --> 00:11:16.680
it actually gives you
an awful lot of stuff.

163
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:20.760
It's not likely that you will
find many type faces that have

164
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.370
this much to play with.

165
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:25.840
And it is also going to mean that
that's not going to be the skinniest

166
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:27.560
font that you could load.

167
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.160
The more axes of variation,
the larger the font file,

168
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:36.050
so that's probably not going to be
the best answer for a lot of uses.

169
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.900
Typically, you're probably gonna
see one to three axes of variation

170
00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.990
as the most common.

171
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:47.534
That's, frankly, hard enough, but it
does give you an awful lot to play with.

172
00:11:51.103 --> 00:11:55.831
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Well,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Having more or

173
00:11:55.831 --> 00:12:00.730
less Cookies, more or
less fringe, all good things.

174
00:12:09.082 --> 00:12:10.830
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: No,
that's not really doing much.

175
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.520
So there's some different examples,
the v-fonts site is really pretty fun and

176
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:22.300
that's gonna show you
where to get them as well.

177
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.340
So all those things are really
nice to be able to see and

178
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.940
figure out where you can find more.

179
00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.120
Some of them are for sale,
some of them are commercial.

180
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:37.040
So this is Danbar, I use this as
a text phase in my presentation.

181
00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.070
This is what I meant about
playing around with the x height.

182
00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:45.806
You can go from really art deco to really
super modern, or somewhere in the middle.

183
00:12:51.723 --> 00:12:54.680
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So
those are some of the main ones.

184
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.432
Interesting of note,
San Francisco was really

185
00:12:58.432 --> 00:13:02.190
sorta-kinda one of the first
true variable fonts.

186
00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:06.730
It wasn't exposed to the end user, but
that's actually been very similar to

187
00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:10.750
what's been under the hood since that was
introduced into the operating system.

188
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.604
That's essentially how they built it, and
that's why a lot of that sort of fed into

189
00:13:14.604 --> 00:13:17.759
the eventual technology that drove
the evolution of the standard.
