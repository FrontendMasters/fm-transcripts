00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.800
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Looking
at proportion again and

2
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.540
it really was remarkable to see
how much attention that got but

3
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.735
here's the stuff that's still happening
today that drives me absolutely nuts.

4
00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:18.001
So this isn't terrible
on the Vogue site but

5
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.961
it's not really that great
either to see headlines

6
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:27.593
that have only like two or
three words in a line.

7
00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:31.293
All of this extra space on
either side of the body copy and

8
00:00:31.293 --> 00:00:35.861
really sorta overly tall line space,
when the lines are that short,

9
00:00:35.861 --> 00:00:39.025
you don't need that much
of a gap between them.

10
00:00:39.025 --> 00:00:41.245
It actually will sorta
slow down your reading and

11
00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.651
reduce the amount of
content people can see.

12
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:47.625
You really wanna make sure that you're
tailoring the typography to make use of

13
00:00:47.625 --> 00:00:53.205
the available screen space to give
people a reasonable experience.

14
00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:57.380
But I still see this in responsive
email newsletters all the time.

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.568
Where they haven't tailored the size
of the heading, and because it's so

16
00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:03.906
big, even it's just breaking letters.

17
00:01:03.906 --> 00:01:06.206
I mean,
it's a really terrible experience, and

18
00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:08.200
that's some of a very reputable company.

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.810
I mean,
that was really disappointing to see that.

20
00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.090
I still get news letters like that today,
I open them up on my phone,

21
00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.239
and just didn't have
a complete word on a line.

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.696
And I think this is really an example
of things being much better and

23
00:01:21.696 --> 00:01:26.110
much more tailored so that it's
using the width of the screen well.

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.670
It's got a much more reasonable
letting in between the line height.

25
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.290
Everything is tailored a little bit better
for that sized screen to give you a really

26
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.690
good experience with plenty of content and
view it's really easy to read and follow.

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.964
So back to some of these samples,
going from that to that makes for

28
00:01:47.964 --> 00:01:54.806
a much better experience for people.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Now,

29
00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:59.685
I think it's maybe a little bit of
a harder concept to get across, and

30
00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:04.729
it's a little bit more abstract, but
one of the things that I want you to

31
00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.730
take away in thinking about typography
particularly when that's not your day job.

32
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.900
This is something to try and

33
00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.040
make what you do if you're more focused
on front end development, building

34
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.250
up the application, it may never be the
kinda thing you spend all of your time on.

35
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.650
But don't worry about the specifics,
worry about the concept of it

36
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.490
just what's more important on
the screen at a given time.

37
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.260
Think about those elements in proportion.

38
00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.480
Think about them together,
think about the point of that mark up.

39
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.640
It's an H1, it's an H2, it's a H3, it's
a block quote, it's an unordered list.

40
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.370
There's a priority of
content on the screen and

41
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.310
the typography should support
the meaning of those tags.

42
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.520
So that'll help guide you.

43
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.150
You may not know the specifics
of that design system.

44
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.440
You might still be working that out,
but as long as you keep in mind,

45
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.750
how do I tell the reader what is
the most important piece of information?

46
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.420
What's the next important?

47
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.280
This is about communication and
influencing behavior.

48
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.080
That's fundamentally what every
piece of design is about.

49
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.550
Every flyer, every sticker,

50
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.600
every business card, every website
is trying to get across an idea.

51
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.310
And usually trying to influence people
to do something, to buy something,

52
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.830
to go somewhere.

53
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.740
That's the point, that's
fundamentally a commercial endeavour,

54
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.210
that's what design's all about.

55
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.220
The typography is meant to help support
that influence through emotion,

56
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.980
through guidance,

57
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.770
through visual hierarchy, through
guiding people's eye around the page.

58
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.720
That's what the typography supposed to do,
so

59
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.910
don't get overly hung up on the specifics.

60
00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.280
Just blur your eyes a little bit, stand
back, think about what is the big picture,

61
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.240
what's the overall goal.

62
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.110
That's gonna help guide you towards making
better choices about whether it's pairing

63
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.060
type or heading sizes or
the way things scale.
