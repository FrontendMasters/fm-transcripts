00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Let me go back
to taking a quick look here.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.260
We've called these styles, so

3
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.990
we've added in the reference to web
fonts and then the overall site styles.

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.023
And what will end up happening.

5
00:00:17.023 --> 00:00:20.300
So this is just our little feature toggle
here, we don't have to worry about that.

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.651
If I open this, actually I'm gonna
open this page up in Chrome so

7
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:26.709
we can throttle the network connection,

8
00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:30.557
and kinda simulate what it's like to
have a really slow loading connection.

9
00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:40.393
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And the other thing
that I want to do is actually go back

10
00:00:40.393 --> 00:00:41.570
in here.

11
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.050
And we're gonna take out
the font display swap,

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.950
actually I don't think I even have
it in there for that, that's good.

13
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.675
That's what we want.

14
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.078
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So when we load
this page here, what I can do and

15
00:00:57.078 --> 00:00:59.220
this is a really useful thing.

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.630
I think a lot of the browsers
are starting to include this.

17
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.528
But Chrome has had this for a while,
to be able to under Network,

18
00:01:07.528 --> 00:01:13.550
let me change where this is located,
so I can see a little better.

19
00:01:19.762 --> 00:01:22.903
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So what we can
do is when you click on Network,

20
00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:26.129
you can click on this
little down arrow here and

21
00:01:26.129 --> 00:01:30.780
you can simulate different
kinds of network connections.

22
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.098
So if we simulate slow 3G and
then trigger a refresh of the page.

23
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.396
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So it's not,
it was to be better if we can make it,

24
00:01:46.396 --> 00:01:48.647
like force it to be even slower.

25
00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:53.561
But you can tell that it took
several seconds for things to load,

26
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:58.384
whereas if we are quick about
adding in that fall back stuff then

27
00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:02.820
we actually should end up
getting a better result.

28
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.380
So if we go back in here.

29
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.740
And I'm gonna go through this
code a lot more carefully but

30
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:15.980
actually I need to change this.

31
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.492
Good, so
this will give us some things to show.

32
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.339
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So
we're gonna change this to Plex Serif.

33
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.013
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So if I don't do
anything else, I've at least triggered it

34
00:02:58.013 --> 00:03:01.448
to make sure that it's going to be
loading those things correctly.

35
00:03:01.448 --> 00:03:08.020
And if I go back to Chrome, and
I'm going to disable the cache,

36
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.043
slow it down,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And now what we

37
00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:20.100
should see, if I can get this slow enough,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: There.

38
00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.700
It's in the fallback font,
and there's the web font.

39
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.040
So that's a useful way for
you to see what will end up happening.

40
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.300
But you can see that got content
on the screen a lot faster.

41
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.870
So if we didn't have the WF
inactive CSS in there,

42
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.890
we would have ended up waiting twice as
long to get the content on the screen.

43
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.644
So that can make the difference
between somebody actually interacting

44
00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:48.948
with your site or just going away.

45
00:03:48.948 --> 00:03:53.648
&gt;&gt; Student: Were you saying
that's built into or Typekit,

46
00:03:53.648 --> 00:03:56.550
the service, the JavaScript.

47
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.664
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Yep, so
there's a couple of different ways.

48
00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:09.920
Now with each of the services,
you can use JavaScript or CSS embedding.

49
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.580
If you use the JavaScript embedding from
the service, they're going to do this same

50
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.330
kind of thing and
then inject those classes in your page and

51
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:25.250
then serve the stuff All of the services
now will also allow you to simply get

52
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.380
that link to a CSS file, and then let you
handle it however you wanna handle it.

53
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.230
And that will be faster.

54
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.351
So what I found is, with all of
the services, if you're relying on

55
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:43.114
them to do that kind of processing,
it's probably going to take a second or

56
00:04:43.114 --> 00:04:47.148
two longer for
you to end up getting the result back.

57
00:04:47.148 --> 00:04:50.456
And even a few hundred milliseconds
can make a significant impact when you

58
00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:52.880
are talking about stuff
getting drawn on screen.

59
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.950
So, it's definitely worthwhile,
that was a huge thing,

60
00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.330
it was the most requested
feature from Typekit for years.

61
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.360
And they only made this available
about six months ago for

62
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.766
you to be able to get a CSS based kit
that gives you just that one line to add.

63
00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:13.960
So you can see in the way this is set up,
we have this line here.

64
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.650
This could just as easily be from Google
Web Fonts or from Typekit or fonts.com.

65
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.430
Linking to a CSS file and

66
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.770
then font face somle server is where
that gets kind of reassembled where

67
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.932
you reference the font family name
that's coming from the service or

68
00:05:32.932 --> 00:05:38.108
the font as you would like it to be
known and which weights and styles.

69
00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:44.760
So you'd have an a, a b, a c, a d for
the regular bold, italic and bold-italic.

70
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.580
And then you'd add that that in down here.

71
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.150
So it'd be loading a, b, c, d.

72
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.030
And once all of those are true,

73
00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.060
that's what's gonna trigger
the session storage variable.

74
00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.490
So those things in combination
are what will really help out in terms

75
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.510
of evening this experience and speeding
up the redraw on one page to the next.
