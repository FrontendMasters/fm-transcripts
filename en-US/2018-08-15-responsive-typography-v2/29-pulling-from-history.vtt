00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.860
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Some of
the things that we can focus in on,

2
00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.220
now that we've got the broad strokes.

3
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.650
We've dealt with setting
a reasonable maximum width.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.100
We've dealt with line height,

5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.960
font size, a few of the basics
in the font variation settings.

6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.670
But optical sizing is one that I
think is worth a little bit of

7
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.020
a history lesson detour
because that's one that

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.010
may not be available in
an overwhelming number of typefaces.

9
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.240
But man, when you can get access to it, it
is really kind of amazing what it can do.

10
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.780
So with any good future display of
technology it's good to start by going

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.340
backwards about 3 or 400 years.

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.738
So this is going back to about 1720.

13
00:00:45.738 --> 00:00:50.589
This is a broad sheet advertising
a typeface from William Caslon.

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.530
And as we sort of cut that out and
normalize for

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.600
physical size, you can see that
6 point Caslon C has a much

16
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.650
thicker stroke in comparison to
the one above which is 72 point.

17
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.600
So one is many times
larger than the other.

18
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.100
But if you were to kind of blow up
the photographs like we have here,

19
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.400
you can see what kind of
a difference there is.

20
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.880
They would actually cut the metal
differently when they were making

21
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.210
the different sizes of type.

22
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.550
So this was entirely normal.

23
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.960
This was intended by the type
designer to make sure that

24
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.580
those delicate features were there
when it's big enough to support it.

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.980
But it's still a nice,
sturdy shape when it's at a smaller size.

26
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.235
Now on the right, you can see
Amstelvar set in a variety of sizes

27
00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:44.045
with a uniform optical sizing set for
the smallest font size.

28
00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:48.415
So the cues there are look at
those top two lines of text, and

29
00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:51.419
look at a fairly even stroke contrast.

30
00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.710
So there's not a whole lot of
variation in the thick and thin.

31
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.779
And watch what happens
when I set the optical

32
00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:07.050
sizing to be equivalent to the font size.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: It

33
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.150
almost looks like a different typeface.

34
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.490
So look at that top line,
Frank Sprung and Collectible Soups.

35
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.430
Look how much more contrast there is,
and delicacy in that stroke.

36
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.050
So if you think about newspaper
headlines versus body copy.

37
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.330
You really want that big bold detail
that really draws you in, and

38
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.000
really has that refined look to it.

39
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.210
But when you need to read the text,
you just need to be able to read the text.

40
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.300
You don't wanna worry about
the shapes falling apart,

41
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.230
because the thin gets too thin,
the thick looks muddy.

42
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.680
It just needs to be a little
bit more normalized.

43
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.520
So effectively you're getting totally
different typefaces out of this, but

44
00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.620
it's actually in keeping with
the intent of the design.

45
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.900
Now, this is something that was
normal going back hundreds of years.

46
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.010
And then was lost when we went to photo
typesetting in the 60s and 70s and

47
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.510
then digital typesetting thereafter.

48
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.860
They went with a single
shape that they just scaled.

49
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.550
So when you look at that
block of text in the middle,

50
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.800
that's what we've been
looking at all this time.

51
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.720
For 30 or 40 years, we've been looking at
the type not in the way it was intended,

52
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.650
because it had to be scaled for
maximum use, not maximum appropriate use.

53
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.675
There are a few typefaces out
there in the market where

54
00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:33.595
the designer has actually marketed
a display face, a text face,

55
00:03:33.595 --> 00:03:37.885
a caption face where they
are using this optical sizing.

56
00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:41.642
But they're actually outputting
a whole set of files that

57
00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:45.415
are a different set of outlines
in order to factor this in.

58
00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:51.530
Now we get it, in theory, if they design
it that way, all in a single file.

59
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.030
So it's really kinda remarkable.

60
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.902
The amount that we can do with that one
typeface just keeps getting more and

61
00:03:58.902 --> 00:04:03.163
more finetunable, so
that we really can create a much

62
00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:07.254
more unique experience,
even with just one file.
