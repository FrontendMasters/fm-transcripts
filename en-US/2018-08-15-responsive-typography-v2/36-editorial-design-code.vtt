00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.550
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Let's take a look at
that Outdoor Magazine, we'll wrap up with

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.430
that unless people have other questions or
other things they wanna look at.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.530
In the part 08 file,

4
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.760
I've got that FF [INAUDIBLE] page as
well as this example magazine page.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.300
So if we take a look
at the HTML it doesn't

6
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.630
look that much different from any other
webpage, it's really pretty standard.

7
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.330
If we took the CSS away, it's simply,

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.424
there's some navigation, there's div's and
articles for stories and

9
00:00:38.424 --> 00:00:45.510
just some indication for
what kind of element it is.

10
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.280
So pretty standard kind of things that
you'd see in everyday web development,

11
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.560
nothing really all that
out of the ordinary.

12
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.739
It's once we start to see that
stuff alone with the CSS,

13
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.640
that's in the SaaS folder, 08

14
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.170
magazine styles, and
there's an awful lot there.

15
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.422
So let's take a look at what that
looks like in the browser again,

16
00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:16.910
let's just scroll up and
down a little bit and take a look.

17
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.880
We've got the main element here, on
the side bar we've just got a few little

18
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.840
stories here, and
then we've got photos with captions.

19
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.140
The rest of the lead story,
second level story,

20
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.460
third level ones, and
then a few other little tidbits over here.

21
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.670
So what I wanted to do was think through
what is typical for some magazine website.

22
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.110
Create some level of hierarchy
in most important story,

23
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.000
next most important story, other
supporting stories, more visual ones.

24
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.410
If you're curious, these are actually all

25
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.370
photos that I took in my travels
to various different places.

26
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.248
And you'll get a kick out of some
of the writing because it's pretty

27
00:02:08.248 --> 00:02:12.327
silly.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So,

28
00:02:12.327 --> 00:02:17.338
what I've ended up doing
with this is try to

29
00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:22.090
think through a lfew different things.

30
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.040
One, what is the layout gonna do,
how is that gonna evolve?

31
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.080
So I'm gonna try and make use of CSS grid,

32
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.070
at the same time that I'm trying
to make use of variable fonts.

33
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.606
So again, there's only two font files
that are in use, there's a serif, and

34
00:02:35.606 --> 00:02:36.451
a sans serif.

35
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:41.544
So it's making use of
install var as the main one,

36
00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:47.530
and so
that's transitioning as we go up and down.

37
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.260
And CSS Grid is what's allowing us

38
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.390
to play around with the layout
without messing with the source order.

39
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.030
And it makes it all move and
reflow pretty easily, so

40
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.920
the way this is working
from a source order.

41
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.200
It's this lead story, and
then it goes down to this one, and

42
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.199
then these and then these and then these.

43
00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:20.240
And that way,
it's going from most important story

44
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.020
to small supporting details and
any total information.

45
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.450
So, semantically, on our phone, without
any styles, for search engines, etc.,

46
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.640
it's in a sensible order but
we can move things around using CSS Grid.

47
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.696
And then experimenting with
making this was really fun.

48
00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:46.553
So if I go and inspect this,
we can play around and

49
00:03:46.553 --> 00:03:55.752
see what's going on here.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

50
00:03:55.752 --> 00:04:00.082
here it is,
let me zoom in on that a little bit,

51
00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:05.870
make that a little bigger,
we've got the background image.

52
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.892
Then we have the H1, and
then we have a layer in the foreground,

53
00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:14.400
so those are three elements, and
it's all inside a figure tag.

54
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.270
It's really fairly simple markup,
it would be very easy to build in a CMS.

55
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:27.660
And if we just start to hide a couple of
things, so I just made that image hidden.

56
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.410
So can see that's what the top layer looks
like, pretty sloppy job in Photoshop but

57
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.310
it got the job done.

58
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.023
And if I hide that one too,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: This

59
00:04:43.023 --> 00:04:45.130
is what we're left with is just the text.

60
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.000
So those things could all
be changed independently.

61
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.433
And if we take a look at
the CSS that's on it,

62
00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:58.540
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: It's using the formulas

63
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:05.282
here but,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: It all just moves and

64
00:05:05.282 --> 00:05:10.397
scales in a similar manner to what
I showed you in the other file,

65
00:05:10.397 --> 00:05:15.028
in the other demo.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

66
00:05:15.028 --> 00:05:21.546
if we go back into the code.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

67
00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:26.156
I tried to imagine writing this so
that I'm nesting things well and

68
00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:28.379
setting up my BEM class names and

69
00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.930
trying to follow some good practises
as if this were a real thing.

70
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.320
And created things like banner ads that
would be placed in different areas

71
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.980
in our content main area.

72
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.420
We've got primary column and
secondary column,

73
00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.930
this is where I'm starting to use
CSS Grid, has anyone worked with Grid yet?

74
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.540
Little bit?

75
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.270
I feel like I know just the tiniest
fraction and I'm already so

76
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.220
blown away with how much you can do
with it, It's really incredible.

77
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.760
And that's actually if you are thinking
about playing around with Grid,

78
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:12.200
this is another good reason for
you to get Firefox.

79
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.060
Because the grid inspector in Firefox,

80
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.320
that's already shipping,
it's in the nightly tools as well.

81
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:22.240
But the Grid Inspector really makes it

82
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.543
easy to see what's going on, and

83
00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:31.921
here we go, what was that, let me try that

84
00:06:31.921 --> 00:06:38.659
again.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So if I just

85
00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:44.330
popped the address in here and we load a
page, it looks exactly as we expect it to.

86
00:06:45.782 --> 00:06:48.590
That's another thing that's interesting,
we have been looking at these

87
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.610
pages in three different browsers,
and it is pretty indistinguishable.

88
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.750
So it really is possible to use these and

89
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:02.940
have them work nicely in Firefox,
Safari, Chrome, Edge.

90
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.110
Like really, once this fully
ships with it on by default

91
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:16.130
then already it's 65 to 70% of
devices where they'll work.

92
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.600
And once we have Firefox it's really
gonna cover a substantial portion of our

93
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.994
normal browsing public.

94
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.507
What I wanted to show you was
in looking at these elements, so

95
00:07:28.507 --> 00:07:33.081
you can see Firefox exposes here,
that's a grid, and

96
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:39.711
as soon as you click on it,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Our layout,

97
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:42.720
grid inspection, and display settings,

98
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.490
it actually gives you
incredible amounts of detail.

99
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.615
So we can toggle all these things on and

100
00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:53.106
it tells you exactly what's
going on in that grid.

101
00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:59.965
It's really amazing, it's easy for
you to create these overlays So

102
00:07:59.965 --> 00:08:04.900
now we can just look
around the design space.

103
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.210
And if I start to make
the screen bigger or

104
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.850
smaller, you can see where
those things change.

105
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.760
So now you can see it's shifted from
basically a three column grid to a two

106
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.800
column 1.

107
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.725
It shows you the grid gutter in between,

108
00:08:20.725 --> 00:08:24.996
see where all the column delineations are,

109
00:08:24.996 --> 00:08:31.240
it's really amazing how much you
can tell about a given layout.

110
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.174
So I really encourage you to check
out what they've got in Firefox,

111
00:08:35.174 --> 00:08:37.550
and the tools are only getting better.

112
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.278
I have to show you
the shape that they are too

113
00:08:39.278 --> 00:08:43.983
cuz that's amazing.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: What I really

114
00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:46.231
wanted to show you is the shape editor,

115
00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:49.810
which is something that they
intend to ship in August.

116
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:56.620
If I inspect this element,
find that figure,

117
00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:02.040
and if you look here for
the active CSS shape outside,

118
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.760
see that little icon,
if you click on it, there's the shape.

119
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.860
And if I wanna start tweaking it and

120
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.210
change, all I have to do is just click and
drag.

121
00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:18.950
Makes it super easy to actually go
through and tailor that exactly the way

122
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:25.090
you want it to be, and then just copy
the resulting CSS back into your project.

123
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:29.554
So it's really super handy, it's the only
dev tool that's doing something like that.

124
00:09:29.554 --> 00:09:32.510
It's really the only way that

125
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.730
you have some visual way to
start to define that shape.

126
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:39.456
You can add more points,
you can do all kinds of things with it,

127
00:09:39.456 --> 00:09:40.495
you can also rotate it.

128
00:09:40.495 --> 00:09:44.940
I don't remember how,
but I know that you can.

129
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.772
So again, this is probably not something

130
00:09:49.772 --> 00:09:54.070
that's a terribly sustainable thing to
build into a content management system.

131
00:09:54.070 --> 00:10:01.480
However, according to the spec, if you
have a transparent image, if that's a PNG.

132
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.660
Then you can actually reference
the PNG itself in the CSS,

133
00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:09.740
in order to have it
follow the transparency.

134
00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.710
So that actually is a way that you could

135
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.850
upload a PNG through
the content management system.

136
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.790
And have the CSS right out in line

137
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:24.320
to reference the URL of the image
itself to create the shape around it.

138
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:29.650
So, that's not supported yet here in,
I don't know if it's in Firefox or

139
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.350
if it's in Chrome, the transparency
aspect of it isn't working.

140
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:38.960
But as a way in the future to
be able to get these kinds

141
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:43.490
of really interesting editorial effects
without having to write custom code.

142
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.220
We can play with typesetting headlines,

143
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.960
we can have transparent image overlays
with text layered underneath.

144
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:54.140
And we can have inset photos that follow
the transparency of the image itself.

145
00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:58.850
Whether it's an outstretched arm, a pile
of grapes on the Jen Simmons labs website

146
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:04.110
or a glass inset here, and
not have to write any code to do it.

147
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:07.700
There is some real power in
CSS that is coming along that

148
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.990
starting to be supported more and more.

149
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.250
All of these things taken together really
can elevate the kinds of work that we

150
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.290
are doing on the web and make things
way more interesting than they are now.
