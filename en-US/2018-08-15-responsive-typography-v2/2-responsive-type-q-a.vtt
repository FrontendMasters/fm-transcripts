00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.933
&gt;&gt; Student: Are you gonna talk at
all about, I've had issues designing

2
00:00:04.933 --> 00:00:09.611
stuff to where's that break,
when you resize the page?

3
00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:14.111
And it's like okay, well this looks
really bad for a few seconds.

4
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:19.112
But how do you know how to,
where's that break where?

5
00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:19.857
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Well,

6
00:00:19.857 --> 00:00:24.215
there's no hard and fast answer to that.

7
00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.849
I think some of the techniques that we're
going to look at today will help, kind of,

8
00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.244
mitigate some of those things.

9
00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:34.208
But what will help, and
the question is really about managing

10
00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:39.171
the true intent of even the origin
of the phrase break point was

11
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:42.434
referring to where is the design break.

12
00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:46.153
And that's really,
that was the whole idea behind that term.

13
00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:52.573
And we've kind of lost sight, I think
a little bit of adding in the tweaks.

14
00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:56.250
So Jeremy Keith has written about
this quite a bit a while ago.

15
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.542
You might have a set of break points that
you use to govern how the layout changes.

16
00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:06.571
But here might be points where the
typography is scaling in an awkward manor.

17
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:08.951
There's no harm in adding a few more.

18
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:14.100
So if you have a particular headline
where you start to have some issues.

19
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.382
There's no harm in actually
creating another break point and

20
00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:20.861
applying it just for that element.

21
00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:24.092
So that way, you can create a little
bit more in between points, or

22
00:01:24.092 --> 00:01:26.680
as Jeremy called them, tweak points.

23
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.482
And that way, there's not really
a downside to performance.

24
00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:35.232
Browsers are really good at
processing all this stuff now.

25
00:01:35.232 --> 00:01:40.556
There's no downside to having 100 or
even 200 media queries in the CSS for

26
00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:43.503
a page, it's all processed very quickly.

27
00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:48.743
So adding in a few more here and
there for special cases is totally fine.

28
00:01:48.743 --> 00:01:53.696
And that's really,
it's one of things that led me to what I'm

29
00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:58.649
gonna show you later today,
is to actually to look at how things

30
00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.331
my scale rather than have to
create all these break points.

31
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:07.781
But that's also predicated upon an
important concept that's a reality for me,

32
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:10.471
is that I work with
Content Management Systems.

33
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:15.007
So the design breaking with this
headline today is not the same,

34
00:02:15.007 --> 00:02:19.471
the way it's gonna break tomorrow
with a different headline.

35
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:25.883
I mean, I know that all the public media.

36
00:02:25.883 --> 00:02:32.611
We used to actually work with WGBH
in Boston, so that's a NPR station.

37
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:35.781
They publish literally hundreds
of pieces of content a day.

38
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:41.962
So there's no way that you could end up
tweaking things for every single headline.

39
00:02:41.962 --> 00:02:45.851
That's actually one of the things that we
have to learn to embrace that we can't

40
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:46.382
control.

41
00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:51.055
So there are little, a few techniques here
and there that we will look at that will

42
00:02:51.055 --> 00:02:53.892
help make things work in
the context of a system.

43
00:02:53.892 --> 00:02:58.375
So things like applying a fix
to a headline that will put

44
00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:02.571
a non-breaking space
between the last two words.

45
00:03:02.571 --> 00:03:06.642
So that you'll never get one word
bumping down, you'll get two, and

46
00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:09.062
that will look a little bit more natural.

47
00:03:09.062 --> 00:03:13.317
It's not an absolute, but some of
these things kind of layered together,

48
00:03:13.317 --> 00:03:17.637
will create a more robust system that
will give you fewer headaches like that

49
00:03:17.637 --> 00:03:19.140
at the in between points.
