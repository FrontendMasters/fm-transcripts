00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.300
&gt;&gt; Jason: Now, the fit and finish part,
they're really sorta polishing things up.

2
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.090
These are some of the details that I
think, if you've never studied typography,

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.950
are very easy to overlook.

4
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.090
But once you see them,
you'll never unsee them.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.006
So what I'm gonna show you are some
things about kerning which is

6
00:00:22.006 --> 00:00:25.770
the spacing between letters and ligatures.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.700
So those are features of
the open type specification,

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.030
which has enabled us to use these
things both in print and online.

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.180
So if you take a look at Moby's Trip and
A Whale of an Afflicted Tale, and

10
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.450
we turn on the open type features,
you'll see a few things.

11
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.000
Between the i and the p in trip, is this
beautiful little ligature connecting them.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.690
In afflicted, the f, f, and
l are joined together and the c and

13
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.940
t is also joined together.

14
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.860
So I'm gonna go back and
look at this again.

15
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.060
Just watch the word afflicted.

16
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.916
See how much more elegant that is?

17
00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:09.190
It just kinda pulls it together a little
bit more, it becomes more of a unit.

18
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.840
It may not be something that you want for

19
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.180
your body copy to have the sorta
more ornate ligatures there, but

20
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.430
it really does make a difference,
just having those details.

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.686
And if you look at it in print,
you'll see it everywhere.

22
00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:27.710
So two fs together or an f and
an I, f, f, and l, those

23
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.810
are some of the more common ligatures
that you would see in every day usage.

24
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.570
A lot of fonts actually have
that turned on by default now.

25
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.680
So those things will actually be there.

26
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.244
It is controllable with CSS,
you can turn these things on or off.

27
00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:43.144
Kerning is also something.

28
00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:46.440
So Moby's Trip up top,
I'm gonna do this again.

29
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.920
Watch the spacing between the letters.

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.040
See how everything kinda came
together a little bit better?

31
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.230
Not everybody agrees with me, but

32
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.210
I think browsers are actually
kinda lousy at letter spacing.

33
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.180
I think quite often,
if you don't do anything,

34
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.570
browsers will tend to set
type very loosely and

35
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.810
I think that that is also something
that is a little uneven between them.

36
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.060
So when you do have open
type enabled fonts and

37
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.790
you can ensure that kerning is forced on,
you'll get a much nicer layout.

38
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.230
You may still end up deciding on larger
headings to tighten the letter spacing

39
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.750
just a little bit.

40
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.900
Just using like a minus one pixel.

41
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.190
That will kinda bring things
together a little bit more.

42
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.980
That just helps large type form
a little bit more cohesive a unit.

43
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.300
If it's set large and

44
00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.440
the letters are really kinda spaced out,
it becomes harder to read.

45
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.020
It slows people down.

46
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.110
Again, just another example
of looking at initial caps.

47
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.290
We've seen this one before.

48
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.210
Just using CSS columns, you're able
to kinda go from two down to one,

49
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.390
just based on breakpoints.

50
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.650
The margins on the block quote down below,

51
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.640
the size of the initial capital, all of
those things are really easy to scale.

52
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.990
There's some libraries out there,

53
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.440
I work a lot with the Drupal
content management system.

54
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.520
Anybody else work with Drupal much?

55
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.630
So there's a module called
Typogrify that you can turn on and

56
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.460
enable for a given input format, and
it will do a few different things for you.

57
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.800
One of the ones that I really love is it
will make sure that all of your quotation

58
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.820
marks and apostrophes are correct.

59
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.832
It replaces all the straight hash
marks with proper quotation marks,

60
00:03:41.832 --> 00:03:46.599
the curly ones, just like they should be,
without you ever having to do anything.

61
00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:51.341
It doesn't even need to have anybody touch
it in the source when you're editing

62
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:52.490
the content.

63
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.540
It handles it on the output side.

64
00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.190
It also does things,
if you watch the end of that paragraph,

65
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.360
enthusiastic support mean the world.

66
00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.660
As it gets narrower, you'll notice that,
technically there's space for

67
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.080
the word the on the line above, but

68
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.030
it bumped down with the world
down below because this module is

69
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.220
adding a non-breaking space between
the last two words of every paragraph.

70
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.804
Fixing orphans is one of those things
that magazine editors will get up and

71
00:04:21.804 --> 00:04:23.673
jump up and down on their desk and

72
00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:28.780
hug you if you can actually fix this
automatically across any screen size.

73
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.550
That module and
Drupal makes that really easy.

74
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.610
It's really just turning something on.

75
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.150
Recently I became the co-maintainer of
that and we're working on some updates for

76
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.250
Drupal 8.

77
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.390
So that's actually coming
along a little bit.

78
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.870
But that library is a PHP library that's
been enabled in some WordPress modules,

79
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.420
I know Aaron Gustafson, a while ago,
made an expression engine plug in for it.

80
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.020
Or you can actually just pull it
in on your own, it's just PHP.

81
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.006
So you can build it into any other system.

82
00:05:00.006 --> 00:05:05.271
I also have in here, in a lot of these
projects, widow tamer which is a really

83
00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:10.295
simple JavaScript library that you
can define fixes for any HTML element

84
00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:15.740
you want and decide how many characters
you want to have on any given line.

85
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.470
So that way you could apply
it to headings if you want

86
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.970
to make sure that you have a minimum of
eight characters or something like that so

87
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.572
you don't end up with one short word
that gets bumped down to the next line.

88
00:05:26.572 --> 00:05:31.542
That one, it hesitate a little bit about
that one because it's client side, and

89
00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:35.636
we already have lots of other
JavaScript going on client side, but

90
00:05:35.636 --> 00:05:37.410
it's pretty light weight.

91
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.712
And so if you don't have
access to using a module,

92
00:05:40.712 --> 00:05:45.670
adding something in like this for
a blog or for some reading focused website

93
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.463
really will improve the reading
experience quite a bit.
