00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.280
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: A little
bit of an anatomy.

2
00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.360
We've got this word, Handglovery,
for whatever reason,

3
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.630
this is one of those words that ends up
being used in type samples all the time.

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.310
Mainly because of the variety
of letter forms in it.

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.690
But on top is a serif typeface, and
on the bottom is a San Serif, so

6
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.510
those are the two basic distinctions
that you'll most often make

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.660
in the type choices that you
will be working with on the web.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.550
Traditionally, a serif typeface has
a little bit more acceptance in text.

9
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.393
It's what you'd see in most books,

10
00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:41.540
it's certainly what you see in print far
more often, especially, historically.

11
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.350
San Serif typefaces, well,
they were actually introduced in the early

12
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.080
part of the 20th century, that's where
they started to gain popularity.

13
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.800
On screen, they were very popular,
even going back to the early 90s,

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.500
because they actually were easier
to draw on screen clearly.

15
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.630
Read very coarse resolution monitors,
so fine detail would get lost.

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.150
The type rendering from the different
operating systems was pretty bad, so

17
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.960
everything would look really chunky.

18
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.170
That's why you ended up
with typefaces like,

19
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.280
Verdana, that were very sort of big and
open.

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.830
It's a San Serif typeface, but
it can render on the cheapest CRT screen.

21
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.130
And it would still be readable and clear.

22
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.990
So designs have gotten a lot better, but
that just means now we have a choice.

23
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.790
If we prefer stylistically to use one over
the other, we know that it's still going

24
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.380
to be nice and legible, and
readable no matter what the device.

25
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.940
So, between the top and
the bottom, it's interesting,

26
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.680
I mean, I love getting into the names of
all of these different little tidbits.

27
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.240
But that's a whole day, or week, or month,

28
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.481
to get into some of those terms.

29
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:02.340
The more important thing, I think, is to
think through how do they work together,

30
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.820
and how do you make some decisions
about how to pair things.

31
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.159
So what I tend to look for,
when I'm starting to

32
00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.340
think through type, is,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Is

33
00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.510
there a relationship.

34
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.360
Let's say we want to
create a pairing of type.

35
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.060
What's the connection?

36
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.550
So I wanna use one kind of type for
headings, and something else for

37
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.700
the body copy.

38
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.030
I want there to be a relationship
between these two typefaces.

39
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.830
I tend to look for
similarities in width, overall shape.

40
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.570
Is it narrow, is it round?

41
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.660
Is there a lot of stroke contrast?

42
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.975
On top, there's a lot of very thick and
thin, on the bottom, it's very even.

43
00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:47.230
So those are the differences that
you want to start to look for.

44
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.830
And I'm gonna look at a couple others.

45
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.840
The anatomy of letter forms, again,
it's also extremely high contrast.

46
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.220
The very exaggerated difference
in the thickness and

47
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.320
thinness of the stroke, and
it's got these really beautiful serifs.

48
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.830
And it's actually designed by a friend of
mind, if you are interested in expanding

49
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.930
your collection of type, check out font of
the month club, from David Jonathan Ross.

50
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.141
It's like six dollars a month,
and you get a new font.

51
00:03:16.141 --> 00:03:19.129
I think it's $6 a month if
you subscribe for the year.

52
00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.830
But every month, he sends out something
new, something interesting to play with.

53
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.540
He sent out a couple different
versions of Roslindale,

54
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.390
which is what I'm using up top there.

55
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.230
And then, he just sent me
a variable version of it, too.

56
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.130
So he's doing some really
interesting things, in any event.

57
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.590
So overall, like that lowercase o,

58
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.610
notice up top, it's quite a bit narrower,
and then, it's got that contrast,

59
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.880
and thickness, and thin, and on
the bottom it's almost a perfect circle.

60
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.250
So you'll start to notice,
in a few different letter forms,

61
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.630
where you see the bigger difference is,

62
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.070
choosing two typefaces that have
an overall similar geometry, even if

63
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.900
other things are different, will help you
find typefaces that work well together.
