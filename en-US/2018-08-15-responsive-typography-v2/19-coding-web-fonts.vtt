00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.600
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So what I thought
I'd do, is I'm gonna start out

2
00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.590
with just taking that page with plex.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.772
So this is in the part-05 folder.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: I'm

4
00:00:16.772 --> 00:00:22.004
gonna actually make a copy of this,
and strip out a few things so

5
00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:27.256
we can see what it looks like
without any of this stuff in place.

6
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.397
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So If I just yank all

7
00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:45.411
of this stuff out of here,
what we end up with is

8
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:51.490
still a perfectly valid readable page.

9
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.130
It's just not gonna have any of
the styling and I can even take out

10
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.070
all of the CSS.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And if I go back and

11
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.540
look at this in the browser.

12
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.708
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So It may not be
pretty, but it's an h1, an h2, some text,

13
00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:30.350
it's all broken up in paragraphs,
there's still a block quote set apart.

14
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.610
It's not the easiest thing, but

15
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.950
if that's what got delivered,
somebody could still read it.

16
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.585
And because we haven't put any explicit
impositions on it, it's going to work and

17
00:01:42.585 --> 00:01:49.090
reflow and still be usable no
matter what device you view it on.

18
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.541
So this is about enhancing now.

19
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:57.439
So we want to build up and
experience from there and so

20
00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.620
you know the easy thing to do
is simply add in the styles.

21
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.320
And that's going to bring it back
to looking like it should look.

22
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.480
But it's not really going
to have the whole picture.

23
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:14.050
So if I put those things back in, I still
don't have any of the JavaScript loading

24
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.190
in there which means we're also
not gonna get the class switching.

25
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.920
But what we can get is the basic page.

26
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.430
So all we've really done

27
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.740
is look at, excuse me.

28
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.740
And one thing that I didn't mention about
this, the way this project is set up.

29
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.280
I am using NPM to add
a bunch of stuff in there for

30
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.610
Gulp to run SASS and
a little local server.

31
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.860
It's not necessary.

32
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.770
I've checked in all of the compiled CSS,
that's all in the CSS folder.

33
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.150
You don't have to run all of
this build process stuff.

34
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.126
It is a little bit cumbersome,
it's just more of a convenience for

35
00:02:58.126 --> 00:03:00.257
me to write the CSS faster this way.

36
00:03:00.257 --> 00:03:06.130
So that it keeps it a little bit clean and
neater for you at the end.

37
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.850
So this is the web font declarations.

38
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.180
So this is the same file that's
being loaded on all of them.

39
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.620
Just so I don't have to make a bunch
of them tailored for each project.

40
00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.480
The important thing to note
is just because you have it

41
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.870
in your @font-face declaration doesn't
mean those files are gonna get loaded.

42
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.880
So that's actually not a problem to list
every possible variant that you might

43
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.230
call in here until you reference it in
your CSS with a font family declaration.

44
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.350
Then it won't trigger
a download on those files.

45
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.270
So this is where you put
things like font display.

46
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.577
So for a standard web font like
these ones for Plex Serif,

47
00:03:50.577 --> 00:03:52.741
the way you would load them.

48
00:03:52.741 --> 00:03:58.980
So this is kind of our standard
kind of body copyish sort of thing.

49
00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.500
So we're loading the regular and

50
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.020
giving it the keywords normal for
style and font weight.

51
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.920
And that means that the browser will
equate it to whatever normal is.

52
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.580
Then when it's bold we just specify
font weight bold, font style italic, or

53
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.090
bold italic.

54
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.760
Notice the font family is the same.

55
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.240
So that's how you can tell the browser
to behave, when I have specified

56
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.240
this font family if I use a strong tag,
reference this font file.

57
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.680
If I use an italic,
reference this font file.

58
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.340
That way you don't have
a browser faking it.

59
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.010
Because some will, and
it looks really terrible.

60
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.610
You wanna make sure that you're
calling a proper italic type face, or

61
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.410
a proper bold type face, so
that it actually has the design that

62
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.190
the designer actually intended,
without some of the muddiness or

63
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.679
incorrect characters being shown by
a browser trying to fake an italic.

64
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.493
So-
&gt;&gt; Student: Wait,

65
00:05:00.493 --> 00:05:03.670
we might be faking it.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

66
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.910
technically they call it synthesizing it.

67
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.900
Firefox will do this in particular and
I think it's a terrible practise.

68
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.250
I think Chrome does it as well.

69
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.070
if took this out here and

70
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.750
didn't include an actual
italic mapped this way and

71
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.450
I set some text with the font family
of Plex Serif and then wrapped an m

72
00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.540
tag around it or an i tag,
the browser will fake an italic out of it.

73
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.538
It will take that typeface and
try and render it slanted.

74
00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:47.493
And the problem with that is it's quite
often going to be not at a particularly

75
00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:49.857
readable angle for that type face and

76
00:05:49.857 --> 00:05:54.904
it's also gonna be missing out on
the correct spacing and clip substitution.

77
00:05:54.904 --> 00:05:58.978
So it may be readable and
some people might not notice but

78
00:05:58.978 --> 00:06:03.921
it's not really going to be
particularly correct or desirable from

79
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:08.245
a truth to the design standpoint.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: There are a lot of

80
00:06:08.245 --> 00:06:12.465
people in the web community
from a development and

81
00:06:12.465 --> 00:06:19.416
performance perspective who think it's
a good thing that browsers will do that.

82
00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:23.337
I have never encountered anybody who
actually cares about design to think

83
00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:25.480
that's an acceptable thing.

84
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.000
It's sort of unfortunate that browsers
adopted that practice in the first place.

85
00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.030
Because in most cases,
especially when you're dealing,

86
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.860
previously when we were dealing with
system fonts, italics were always there.

87
00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:39.550
It didn't matter.

88
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.390
There was no reason for the browser to
actually do that in the first place,

89
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.000
because that stuff was already
available on the system
