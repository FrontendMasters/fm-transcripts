WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.600
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: This is that
sample page using Plex, which is

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.700
a beautiful set of typefaces that IBM
developed for their own identity recently.

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.020
And they open-sourced all of it, so
you can actually go use them if you want.

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.385
But this is a quick example of
dealing with the loading process well,

5
00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:22.570
so watch what happens here.

6
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.850
I'm toggling the web fonts on and off.

7
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.665
Now, there's a little bit of jumpiness
down here with the line length change,

8
00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:31.780
just at the bottom here.

9
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.170
But if this were even
any smaller a screen,

10
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.430
you wouldn't really see
much reflow at all.

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.038
So what I'm doing is I'm toggling those
wf-active and inactive classes, and

12
00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:48.026
I'll open up the web inspector so
you can see what that actually looks

13
00:00:48.026 --> 00:00:53.135
like.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

14
00:00:53.135 --> 00:01:00.440
here's the CSS on the h1
with the web fonts on.

15
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.070
You see that it's got just
the normal styles there.

16
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.370
And when I toggle them off,
when the wf-inactive class is present,

17
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.770
notice it's calling Georgia,
it's not calling Plex Serif.

18
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.250
And then it's got a letter
spacing of -5 pixels.

19
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.385
And watch what happens when I
turn that letter spacing off.

20
00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:22.560
See how much things sort of jump around?

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.670
Now, that might not be a big deal with
this view, but what if the window

22
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.180
were just a little bit narrower, and
that spacing was coming and going?

23
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.269
It could actually be enough
to force that to wrap.

24
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.213
Now I won't be able to show you.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Of course

25
00:01:44.213 --> 00:01:49.220
not.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Best laid plans.

26
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.575
Well, we do the same thing with
the h2 where there's actually

27
00:01:55.575 --> 00:02:00.843
a fairly significant jump.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: You see that

28
00:02:00.843 --> 00:02:06.600
stuff kinda moves around quite a bit more
when the correction is there or not.

29
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.380
It's even more prevalent
when we look here,

30
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.510
where we have letter spacing and
font size changes.

31
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.660
So see how different it is when you
don't have the correction in place.

32
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.290
So, this took me all of about 10 or

33
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.830
15 minutes to add that
fallback code in there.

34
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.280
And now the experience is
much more seamless for

35
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.000
people during that loading process where
things aren't really moving around.

36
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.200
And really, one of the only reason is
you see the jump there is I still have

37
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.540
a transition in the CSS.

38
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.697
If I turned that off,
then it would actually be pretty

39
00:02:46.697 --> 00:02:51.980
instant.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And

40
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.914
so the way that ends up looking,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Is I

41
00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:02.630
just add that little declaration
right after the paragraph stuff.

42
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.980
So if we go over, and I'm just
gonna open this up quickly in Code.

43
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.025
I don't wanna get too
sidetracked with that just yet.

44
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.740
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: There we go.

45
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.390
So we have the declaration for
the paragraph, font-size and line-height.

46
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.410
And then when .wf-inactive is present, I
just change the font-size and line-height.

47
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.110
So I just tweak those little values.

48
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.504
If you add the declaration, and
then look at it in the browser,

49
00:03:35.504 --> 00:03:38.076
that's why I added that
little toggle button.

50
00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:41.130
And that's just a little chunk of code
you could drop in any page template.

51
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.730
It's all self contained.

52
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.200
And you can use that to kind of
turn the web fonts on and off and

53
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.620
tweak those values until
things aren't moving around.

54
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.780
Won't take you really all that long to do.

55
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.390
You really only have to do it once,
and it will usually do enough for

56
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.120
any other content that
you'll see on your site.

57
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.450
So really does help kind of
mitigate that loading process.

58
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.350
And should those web fonts never load,
they're still going

59
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.250
to get that experience, because
the JavaScript is inline in the page.

60
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.740
So the class is going to get added.

61
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.700
I mean, that's the biggest thing.

62
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.000
You don't have to worry about
the JavaScript not being delivered.

63
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.576
It's actually in line in the page, so that
way you know the class will get added.

64
00:04:22.576 --> 00:04:24.802
And if you have your CSS set up correctly,

65
00:04:24.802 --> 00:04:29.193
even devices that don't understand web
fonts for whatever reason are still going

66
00:04:29.193 --> 00:04:34.049
to get a good experience.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Any questions on

67
00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:40.108
the stuff that I've covered so far?
&gt;&gt; Student: And

68
00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:43.938
so that wf-inactive value,

69
00:04:43.938 --> 00:04:49.180
that's been in there since 2010.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

70
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.750
2010 is when the first web font
loader was released by Google.

71
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.430
They actually worked on that.

72
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.540
I think it was Google and
Adobe that worked on that together, and

73
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.850
they open sourced it.

74
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.980
So very quickly, Google Web Fonts and
Typekit started to make use of that,

75
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.580
and that's where it first
became a bit of a standard.

76
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.510
Initially, fonts.com put
something similar in place but

77
00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:15.890
they're using a different class name.

78
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.080
And thankfully after a while
they dropped that, and

79
00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.470
everybody kind of
standardized on the same one.

80
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.597
So that way we can kind of all write
the CSS, kind of across the board.

81
00:05:25.597 --> 00:05:31.210
So that Google Web Font Loader was
the first open source project.

82
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.230
That's kind of evolved over time.

83
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.310
One of the people that created
that initially was Bram Stein,

84
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.570
who works for Typekit.

85
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.650
He's recently, or more recently,
created Font Face Observer.

86
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.849
I've found that to be the most
performant way of loading stuff.

87
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:53.070
If you want truly exhaustive
comparisons of font-loading techniques,

88
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.270
follow Zach Leatherman
from the Filament Group.

89
00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.940
He has written some incredibly
thorough analysis of

90
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.510
different font loading techniques.

91
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.050
I've tried many of them and I've found
this to be the most reliable and

92
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.120
the easiest to maintain.

93
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.290
So that's really where I went with it.

94
00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:17.630
There are other things that people
do to optimize font performance.

95
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.410
Many of them will stumble over
the licensing with the font itself.

96
00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.631
So that's actually something kind
of worth pausing for a moment.

97
00:06:27.631 --> 00:06:29.894
If you are going and getting fonts,

98
00:06:29.894 --> 00:06:34.562
you need to make sure that you have
a proper license to use them on the web.

99
00:06:34.562 --> 00:06:37.630
And that also means that
you can't convert them.

100
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:40.090
That's almost certainly
a violation of the license.

101
00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:42.860
So getting somebody's desktop fonts and

102
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:48.190
then going to Font Squirrel and turning
them into a web font, that is not legit.

103
00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:51.360
And you're also going to
get an inferior font,

104
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.710
because those conversion processes
are not optimizing things at all.

105
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.230
There's a ton of work that goes into
making fonts work well on the web.

106
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.023
In most cases,

107
00:07:01.023 --> 00:07:05.227
they're just not that expensive.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: The client,

108
00:07:05.227 --> 00:07:08.630
the organization, whoever you work for,
they can pay a little bit of money.

109
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:13.810
It might only be a few hundred bucks to
get font files that are in WOFF2 format.

110
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.813
That's really what you want
to be using these days.

111
00:07:16.813 --> 00:07:19.373
You might need to have one or
two other fallback versions,

112
00:07:19.373 --> 00:07:23.153
but WOFF2 is supported basically
in every shipping browser.

113
00:07:23.153 --> 00:07:26.353
It's got the most compression,
and the most feature support.

114
00:07:26.353 --> 00:07:28.743
So generally speaking,
that's what you wanna be looking for.
