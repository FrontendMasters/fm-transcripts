00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.840
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: We're gonna get
into a little bit of typography 101,

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.860
responsive typography.

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.560
What exactly are variable fonts and
what's the status of them, and

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.460
when can we start playing around?

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.750
Performance, proportion, polish, all
aspects of implementing web fonts well.

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.286
And then I've got some really new stuff.

7
00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:24.935
And that's the part that I'm really
excited about for people who are really

8
00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:29.026
into what are the latest things
in front end and HTML and CSS.

9
00:00:29.026 --> 00:00:31.450
And we're gonna not just
play with variables, but

10
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.100
we're going to with variable fonts.

11
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.500
We're gonna use CSS variables.

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.954
We're gonna use calculation.

13
00:00:35.954 --> 00:00:39.320
We're gonna do some pretty
cool stuff that I think you'll

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.734
agree when you see it all together, adds
up to way more than the sum of its parts.

15
00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:49.500
And there's a lot of really interesting
things coming along in the world of

16
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.210
CSS that really gives us a tremendous
amount of control and flexibility.

17
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.030
And then again try to look at some of
those finer details, and different ideas

18
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.060
that we can bring to the project to create
a greater sense of differentiation,

19
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.560
both in visual hierarchy on the page but
also between what you're working on and

20
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.480
what anything else looks
like that we see on the web.

21
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.700
So responsive typography in a nutshell.

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.110
When I wrote the book, there
are really sorta four main areas that

23
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.230
I wanted to focus on, performance
really being one of the most important.

24
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.180
And I say it's the most
important not because,

25
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.810
as a designer, I think it's more
important than the aesthetics,

26
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.510
but it's the objection that keeps us
from using fonts in the first place.

27
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.790
So if we don't deal with performance
then we don't get to play

28
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.050
around with the design.

29
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.540
And that's understandable because you
don't really have a lot of time before

30
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.630
people bail.

31
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.950
And so, we don't wanna introduce any
barriers to content getting on screen.

32
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.030
And we also wanna think about
not just what you're loading and

33
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.545
how much but how you're loading it.

34
00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:01.613
Because that can make a big difference
if you worked a lot with JavaScript,

35
00:02:01.613 --> 00:02:06.006
you know that there's defer, there's
async, there's different strategies

36
00:02:06.006 --> 00:02:10.075
that you can put in place to make sure
that the content can render quickly and

37
00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:11.649
then other stuffs comes in.

38
00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:13.420
And that's just a natural part of the web.

39
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.930
I wanna make sure that we embrace that.

40
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.910
We also wanna ensure that we're
not leaving devices behind.

41
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.840
So we're talking about really cutting
edge stuff with variable fonts, but

42
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.160
even just web fonts themselves.

43
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.930
There are about 400 million Opera Mini
devices in the world that don't support

44
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.330
web fonts at all.

45
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.272
You also have the condition
of web fonts not being

46
00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:41.104
supported because you're on the subway,
because you're out in the country.

47
00:02:41.104 --> 00:02:45.000
For me, if I'm on the commuter rail
between Providence and Boston,

48
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.560
there's at least three or four places
where a signal drops out entirely.

49
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.740
So if you haven't implemented
web fonts correctly,

50
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.500
someone might not get content at all.

51
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.940
So we wanna make sure that we
embrace flash on style text.

52
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.540
In fact, we lean into that and
consider that the standard.

53
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.620
That's actually what we want and there's
a few different ways that we can help

54
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.370
trigger that in order to get
the content on screen but do so

55
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.170
in a way that will still
provide a solid experience.

56
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.410
Proportion is a big thing.

57
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.775
This actually was one of the most central
elements to my book when I kind of

58
00:03:24.775 --> 00:03:30.210
rejiggered the whole thing around
this notion of responsive typography.

59
00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.820
You don't need to have a heading as big
as you would have it on the desktop on

60
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.370
a small screen, it's really ungainly, it's
hard to read, it wraps really poorly and

61
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.390
you still just need hierarchy, it just
doesn't need to be as exaggerated, so

62
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.640
on a small screen, we wanna make sure that
we scale the proportion of headings and

63
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.690
body copy.

64
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.030
And then make sure it still works well and

65
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.370
gets the attention it needs
once you get back to a big one.

66
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.320
I really like the phrase
design is the details.

67
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.530
Because there are lots of
frameworks out there and

68
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.300
this is not to pick on Bootstrap but
if you simply create a site, pull in

69
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.420
the Bootstrap library, you will have
a reasonably competent looking project.

70
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.410
I mean that's fair, and

71
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.960
it's not necessarily what I
think of as great design but

72
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.770
it brings everything up
on an even playing field.

73
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.150
It keeps thing in a sort
of an orderly manner.

74
00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.526
Things will reflow pretty well, but it's
not the details that will set it apart.

75
00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:38.230
There are 1 million other sites out
there that look just like Bootstrap

76
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.800
out of the box.

77
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.370
So that's not a good way to
differentiate what your work.

78
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.430
So we're gonna concentrate on what are
the small details that will really start

79
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.380
to set your work apart.

80
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.510
So those things taken together, I think
are kind of at the heart of what I'm

81
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.470
referring to when I say
responsive typography.

82
00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.716
And we'll get a chance to see
how the type plays into that.

83
00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:05.530
But this is a little precursor to

84
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.920
getting into performance, and
this is still a pretty common thing.

85
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.545
That screen on the right
sometimes is what people see for

86
00:05:15.545 --> 00:05:22.200
5, 10, 15 seconds, on a slow network
connection waiting for web fonts to load.

87
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.740
And then, finally, you get content.

88
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.310
You'll notice the one on the left, you
could read the whole time, because it was

89
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.020
set up so that it would automatically
go to the fallback font right away, and

90
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.750
then flip over to the web
fonts once they load it.

91
00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.420
So it's not blocking page render and

92
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.250
it's not blocking the user
from interacting with content.

93
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.690
So those are the kinds of things
that we want to lean into.

94
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.670
Now, for
what I was talking about with proportion,

95
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.060
if we look at this design here,
you can see that that top level heading,

96
00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.960
A Whale of a Tale,
is quite a bit larger than body copy.

97
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.400
But if you look at that on tablet and

98
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.710
then on the phone,
it's proportionally getting smaller, but

99
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.820
it's still very clear what the most
important piece of information is.

100
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.693
So that's what I'm talking about
looking at the proportion and

101
00:06:14.693 --> 00:06:18.280
creating this sorta sliding
scale that will ensure that you

102
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.742
still have the appropriate level of
importance that's being conveyed.

103
00:06:22.742 --> 00:06:26.885
It's an H1, it's supposed to be the most
important thing on the page, but

104
00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:29.086
you wanna make sure that it's not huge,

105
00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:34.140
pushing everything down and out of
the way, wrapping poorly, breaking words.

106
00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.784
Those kinds of things I see all the time,
even today.

107
00:06:37.784 --> 00:06:41.620
I mean this is not new.

108
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.080
I wrote about this five years ago.

109
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.140
And there's still a lot of people
that haven't really thought this all

110
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.390
the way through.

111
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.930
As a matter of fact, looking at
styleguides.io, which is a great resource

112
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:59.240
for looking at design systems, I found
two design systems on the first page or

113
00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.420
two of results that actually had a type
system that scaled with screen size.

114
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.250
And these are very large corporations.

115
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:13.148
So it's still something that is not on the
minds of everybody that it needs to be.

116
00:07:13.148 --> 00:07:15.796
So when you are thinking
through a design system,

117
00:07:15.796 --> 00:07:19.579
that's the perfect time to think through,
how old this moving scale,

118
00:07:19.579 --> 00:07:24.340
because if you fix it there then it gets
fixed everywhere you apply that system.

119
00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.650
So it's really important
to keep that stuff in mind.

120
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.570
Now there's lots of interesting
techniques that we can do with CSS that

121
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.850
really draw strong parity
with what we can do in print.

122
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.010
Large initial capitals,
breaking things into columns.

123
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.340
Making sure that things reflow
nicely when the screen gets smaller.

124
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.860
It's an interesting thing right now.

125
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.120
We can actually achieve more
typographically on the web

126
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.640
in some cases than we can in print.

127
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.210
Especially with variable funds because we
can actually take advantage of that stuff

128
00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:03.130
far more easily in print than in most
applications for a desktop right now and

129
00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.310
there's some really interesting things
about fine typographic details that

130
00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.670
are just not possible with any
other technology right now.

131
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.860
The future of this is stuff that
we're going to look at today, and

132
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.514
then it's some stuff that you can use,
and some things that are coming.

133
00:08:23.514 --> 00:08:28.649
And we'll look at ways that you can start
to integrate that into how you're working,

134
00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:33.280
so you can do this in a sorta safe and
production ready manner.

135
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.280
Variable fonts,
more modern elements in CSS.

136
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.330
We're gonna look at even more interesting
things that are coming along with

137
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.350
performance.

138
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.494
And really kinda getting beyond just the
basics of dropping in a line of CSS and

139
00:08:46.494 --> 00:08:47.720
forgetting about it.
