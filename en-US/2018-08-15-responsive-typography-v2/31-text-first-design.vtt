&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: At the heart of
designing from the content out,

2
00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.720
is thinking about what is
the smallest element of content.

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.180
And for a text side, or a media side
of some kind, that's a paragraph.

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.470
I actually spent quite a bit
of time a few years ago,

5
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.120
I had written a talk that was really
just about the history of the paragraph.

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.260
And just kinda went through
the Evolution of it as a concept, and

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.950
an execution over the last
couple thousand years.

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.480
And it was really kind of interesting to
see, even going back to how a paragraph

9
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.520
indicator would have been represented
in Greek, in Ancient Greek.

10
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.550
Not modern Greek, but in Ancient Greek,
you can represent that in CSS today.

11
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.170
So it's actually kind of amazing how much
you can do with that atom of content.

12
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.760
So in this page,
we've got a few different things going on.

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.200
We've got maximum width,
we have an initial cap.

14
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.280
We also have some ligatures going on.

15
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.900
We've got proper quotation
marks that are being enforced,

16
00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.630
we've got the Ink Script in
the underlining for the link there.

17
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.349
And there's a few things further
down in that sample page, but

18
00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:17.582
I've really tried to kind of carry through
as many of these different techniques,

19
00:01:17.582 --> 00:01:23.360
as applied to the paragraph, and
then kind of build out from there.

20
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.390
And you kinda focus in on
some of those details.

21
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.060
You can see how that
ligature comes together.

22
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.430
We also have things like making
sure there's proper hyphenation,

23
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.680
the section dividers, the initial bold
line of the first line of a paragraph.

24
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.560
Did anybody know that there's actually
a real pseudo selector in CSS to select

25
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.460
the first line of any element?

26
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.170
I mean, that's really, it's useful,
and it's a nice technique.

27
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.420
So any paragraph you could say,

28
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.230
first of type, first line, and it will do,
you style it however you like.

29
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.060
First of type, first letter
will get you the first letter.

30
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.140
Now, initial letter is
a selector that is coming,

31
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.370
it's only implemented in one browser so
far.

32
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.190
So it's a little hard to hang your
hat on that, it will be much better,

33
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.160
but we can use first of type,
first letter, and

34
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.015
get that same possibility.

35
00:02:21.015 --> 00:02:25.740
And so, getting at all those details,
adding those things, layering them

36
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.890
on one after another, is what's going to
really take things to that next level.

37
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.397
So let's take a look at some of
those details in the CSS for

38
00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:35.341
some of these pages we've been looking at.
