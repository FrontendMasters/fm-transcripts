00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.972
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: One last
thing that I wanted to show you.

2
00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:09.348
And if we have any more questions, we can
talk about that, or we can wrap it up.

3
00:00:09.348 --> 00:00:14.350
codepen.io/jpamental, and if you go there,

4
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.745
you'll see my nice little profile photo.

5
00:00:18.745 --> 00:00:23.422
But more important,
if you click on Collections,

6
00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:29.760
Variable Font Demos,
in here you'll find a whole bunch of them.

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.527
So if you want to look at things
that are playing around with one

8
00:00:34.527 --> 00:00:36.738
specific element at a time?

9
00:00:36.738 --> 00:00:43.782
Some different experiments with
different ways to treat optical sizing,

10
00:00:43.782 --> 00:00:49.829
proportional weights that are all
relative to the core weight.

11
00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.239
All a little bit more isolated, so
you can look at things one at a time.

12
00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.533
Rather than trying to pick through some
of the demos that have everything all

13
00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:57.610
together.

14
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.140
So these things might be
worth playing around with,

15
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.860
because they're a little
bit more stripped down.

16
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.180
So that you can kind of play around
these things a little bit more easily.

17
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.340
So you can see each one of these here,
there's the baseline,

18
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.185
set with font grade, and
optical sizing, and all that.

19
00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:22.933
And if we want to take
a look at different lines of

20
00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:28.025
text,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

21
00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:32.860
we know Frank Sprung is set in an H1,
we go down to the H1.

22
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.846
You'll see optical sizing here
is still forced to 16, so

23
00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:40.126
you're not getting the extreme thick and
thin.

24
00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:41.851
You can just go in CodePen,

25
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.456
you can edit it right there,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And

26
00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:48.650
you can see the change right away.

27
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.230
So CodePen's a really nice place to go and
play around with some of these things.

28
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.420
You don't have to have a code
editor installed, it'll run SAS for

29
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.490
you, all that stuff right there.

30
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.550
So please feel free to play
around with any of these things.

31
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.207
I mean, you have all of the demos,
but some of them are pretty big.

32
00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.774
So if you wanna experiment with some
of these things a little bit more in

33
00:02:07.774 --> 00:02:10.434
isolation, I hope you'll
play around with those,

34
00:02:10.434 --> 00:02:14.091
too.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Any other questions,

35
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.132
anything else anybody wants to ask about,
or

36
00:02:16.132 --> 00:02:21.405
take a look at?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Newbie question,

37
00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:25.302
so you play around with this, and then
figure out something that you like, and

38
00:02:25.302 --> 00:02:28.280
then kind of use the code in your own-
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Yep, yeah, and

39
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.002
this is why I started putting
these things on CodePen.

40
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:35.166
Because you can embed these,
you can share them,

41
00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:39.019
you can do whatever you want,
and then more people see them.

42
00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.365
And this is the reason why I use
this platform instead of others,

43
00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:49.317
is now, this is some place where
more people can look at it.

44
00:02:49.317 --> 00:02:54.647
So if you want to make your own copy,
you hit Fork, and that will copy it over,

45
00:02:54.647 --> 00:02:58.364
and then you can sort of save
it into your own account.

46
00:02:58.364 --> 00:03:02.191
And then you can play around with these
things, and change the values, and

47
00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:04.330
it gets reflected in real time.

48
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.388
You can then copy that code right out of
there and put it into your own project,

49
00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:09.957
you can do whatever you want.

50
00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:14.223
So Chris Coyier and
Dave Rupert are friends of mine, and so

51
00:03:14.223 --> 00:03:17.804
I had been talking to them
quite a bit about this.

52
00:03:17.804 --> 00:03:20.227
The guys that did the Shop Talk Show, and

53
00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:23.083
Chris Coyier is one of
the creators of CodePen.

54
00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:26.612
And so they were really kind
of excited about this stuff,

55
00:03:26.612 --> 00:03:29.194
I was on their podcast earlier this year.

56
00:03:29.194 --> 00:03:31.967
And that kind of got me
thinking about the fact that,

57
00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:36.269
because this is a social platform, and
I want more developers to see this stuff?

58
00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.010
It's a natural place for me to put it,
and talk about it, and share it.

59
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.234
So they've been kind enough to share some
of these things in their newsletters.

60
00:03:44.234 --> 00:03:47.010
So that outdoor magazine one,
and the FF Meadow one,

61
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.244
they've kinda put in their newsletters.

62
00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:51.283
And so
thousands of people have looked at it, and

63
00:03:51.283 --> 00:03:54.135
lots of people have forked them off,
and started to play with them.

64
00:03:54.135 --> 00:03:56.537
That's what I want,
that's the whole point,

65
00:03:56.537 --> 00:03:59.128
is to just kind of spread
the information about it.

66
00:03:59.128 --> 00:04:03.938
Get more people thinking about it, playing
with it, starting to make use of it,

67
00:04:03.938 --> 00:04:06.653
and just kind of see
what people come up with.

68
00:04:06.653 --> 00:04:13.081
So there's something that,
I cannot believe it took 20 years for

69
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:17.817
somebody to make a conference
with this name, but

70
00:04:17.817 --> 00:04:20.780
right-click, View Source.

71
00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.420
That is been how I've been learning
web design and development for

72
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.670
25 years, because that was built
in to the very first web browser.

73
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.570
That was the point, was for
people to be able to share and

74
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.684
learn from what other people are doing.

75
00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:37.267
And so before there were books,
before there were blogs,

76
00:04:37.267 --> 00:04:41.359
before there were podcasts,
the only way that we had to learn was,

77
00:04:41.359 --> 00:04:43.566
what did somebody else figure out?

78
00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:47.600
View Source, print it out, look at it,
copy it into your another file, and

79
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.960
start to muck around with it,
and see what you can make happen.

80
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.426
It is an integral part of the web, it's
the thing that makes it beautiful, and

81
00:04:57.426 --> 00:04:58.684
awesome, and open.

82
00:04:58.684 --> 00:05:02.755
And so yeah, I hope that's never possible,
I mean, people do try and

83
00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:04.488
obscure things a little bit.

84
00:05:04.488 --> 00:05:09.278
But if you can read it in a browser,
in order for it to render the page,

85
00:05:09.278 --> 00:05:11.340
you can look at it.

86
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.990
I think that was the big challenge
with fonts in the first place,

87
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.600
was figuring out how to serve those fonts,
but not make it easy for you to take them.

88
00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.782
Which is fine, that's legitimate, I mean,
people need to make a living designing and

89
00:05:23.782 --> 00:05:24.924
selling these things.

90
00:05:24.924 --> 00:05:30.650
But it wasn't until they figured out
how to make that work in a browser,

91
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.285
in a way that made it,
maybe not impossible.

92
00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:38.896
But really, really difficult for
somebody to get those font files and

93
00:05:38.896 --> 00:05:40.314
walk away with them?

94
00:05:40.314 --> 00:05:42.624
We wouldn't be doing any
of this stuff right now.
