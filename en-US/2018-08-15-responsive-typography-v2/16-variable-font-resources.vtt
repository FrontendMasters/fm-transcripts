00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.710
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Some resources,
Axis-Praxis is a fabulous website.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.915
If you haven't seen this yet,

3
00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:11.830
axis-praxis.org is put together by
a friend of mine, Laurence Penney.

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.540
And this is a playground.

5
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.210
He put this up just weeks after variable
fonts were initially launched as a way for

6
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.080
you to go select any one
of these blocks of text.

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.630
And there, he has a whole slew of variable
fonts that have been given to him to

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.970
include in this, so

9
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.300
that you can select any block,
change to different variable fonts.

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.160
It will show you all the available
axes of variation with a slider and

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.640
a number value, so
you can play around with them.

12
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.790
You can click on the CSS link above
the word font in font variations and

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.785
see the CSS in real-time, or
copy it into your own project.

14
00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:51.200
It also exposes all the OpenType
features that are available.

15
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.920
So ligatures, fractions, number styles,

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.840
we'll look at a bunch of those other
features, are all accessible here too.

17
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.010
So it's a great tool for

18
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.410
you to start to see what's possible
with some of these different fonts.

19
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.474
The Variable Fonts site, or v-fonts.com,

20
00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:14.270
is put together by Nick Sherman
as a catalog site.

21
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.378
So he's trying to make sure that he can
list every variable font that he sees come

22
00:01:19.378 --> 00:01:24.736
onto the market, either a professional
commercial one, or open source efforts.

23
00:01:24.736 --> 00:01:29.580
And if you just go to GitHub and search
variable fonts, you'll find a whole slew

24
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.650
of variable font projects that you can
just download and start to play with.

25
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.379
But there are now starting to see
some really interesting commercial

26
00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:41.429
ones coming out.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: This project on GitHub

27
00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.550
from Monotype is one that you can download
and play with on your own system.

28
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.470
And what it looks like by default is it
just says drop something here up top.

29
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.600
And you can drag and drop a variable font
that you might have on your own system,

30
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.870
and it will load it up, show you
all of the different instances, and

31
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.770
the number ranges with some sliders.

32
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.980
And then give you a live,
editable text area down below so you can

33
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.000
put whatever text you want in there and
create your own little live text widget.

34
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.810
That helps you to kinda figure out,
what are the named instances?

35
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.330
What are the different values?

36
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360
What are the low and high-end number
ranges that you can play with?

37
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.683
And then actually see it
with a block of text.

38
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:23.126
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Microsoft also has put

39
00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:26.900
out an intro to variable fonts website.

40
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.120
That's also linked in the slides.

41
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.780
So there's a ton of information here
with links to lots of resources and

42
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.350
explanation about how
variable fonts work and

43
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.056
what they do,
all in a really nicely designed page.

44
00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:41.320
Type Network,

45
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.670
it's another one that I've been working on
with them to get this website launched.

46
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.414
This will showcase how
variable fonts work,

47
00:02:49.414 --> 00:02:54.175
how you might use them in publishing, and
a bunch of fonts that they are going to

48
00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:58.969
have commercially available.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Monotype also put

49
00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:03.308
up their own intro to variable
fonts a few weeks ago, and

50
00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:08.000
I had the good fortune to get
to design the demo for them.

51
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.580
So this page is linked from that one, and

52
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.080
this is using a variable font that
they released that anyone can use.

53
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.640
We actually will be playing
with this one as well, FF Meta.

54
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.998
It's a great typeface, and
they've introduced that as a variable

55
00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:28.830
font that's sort of free to use for
quite a while, I think till 2019.

56
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.080
And they'll have other
commercial options available.

57
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.214
But this one has the entire weight
range and italics and the file's 84K.

58
00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:40.744
I mean, it's kind of incredible
what you can get out of it.

59
00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:43.706
And what I did with this
page was just try and

60
00:03:43.706 --> 00:03:48.330
show the range that you can get when
you have that at your disposal.

61
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.523
There's another one from my friend Oliver,

62
00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:55.081
put up this fantastic
site using Output Sans,

63
00:03:55.081 --> 00:03:59.749
another variable font from David Jonathan
Ross, of the Font of the Month Club fame.

64
00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:05.004
And this page, likewise, has a fantastic
explanation of variable fonts,

65
00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:08.960
but also showcases what they
can do all within that page.

66
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.230
So these are great for not only getting
inspiration, and seeing what they can do.

67
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.680
But also passing it along to a designer
that you know, or a manager, or

68
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.380
anybody else on your team so

69
00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.280
they can actually see what variable
fonts are all about in variable fonts.

70
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.330
And that's really the best way to really
see exactly what the technology can do.

71
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.500
And I've got a slew of stuff up on
CodePen that you can play around with.

72
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.280
But more important is that I'm showing
this to you in the Firefox Nightly build.

73
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.980
And if you look down below,
I have just opened up the dev tools.

74
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.640
There's now a three pane view and
a font pane and

75
00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.130
it will showcase everything available in
that variable font, right in the browser.

76
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.420
So this is probably the most useful way,
because you can look at your own layout.

77
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.940
So as you're working on your site, you
actually have these tools right here that

78
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.240
you can play around with, all of these
sliders, with any individual element.

79
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.400
It will update the CSS live.

80
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.240
You can then just copy it right back into
your project, so it's incredibly helpful.

81
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.869
They're working on even
more tools in here.

82
00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:17.278
Also, if there are named instances,

83
00:05:17.278 --> 00:05:21.355
there will be a drop down right
there that will let you pick them.

84
00:05:21.355 --> 00:05:24.619
And it will update the sliders and
the CSS values live for you, so

85
00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:27.420
we'll take a look at some of that too.

86
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.020
But that browser is just running
rings around everybody right now

87
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.240
in terms of implementation of
useful things for variable fonts.

88
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.260
It's also incredibly fast.

89
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.430
If you haven't looked at Firefox lately,
in the last six months or

90
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.580
so, you really need to try it out.

91
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.970
It's really worth it.

92
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.240
It's a whole new rendering engine.

93
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.342
It's definitely the fastest thing on

94
00:05:47.342 --> 00:05:51.908
the web right now.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: In terms of fonts

95
00:05:51.908 --> 00:05:54.418
that are becoming available,

96
00:05:54.418 --> 00:06:00.200
when I started giving talks on this,
there were like three.

97
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.920
Now there's dozens and
more coming out all the time but

98
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.090
what a lot of people are gonna be asking
about are what about the open source ones?

99
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.200
So this is just a screenshot
of work being done on Roboto.

100
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.870
So there are a number of core variable
fonts that are being worked on so

101
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:20.860
that we'll have our variable open sans or
whatever.

102
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.690
I think there's a source sans variable
that's in the works and a bunch of others.

103
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.760
So we'll have good core

104
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.530
usable variable fonts that we can
start to rely on pretty soon.

105
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.181
And there are lots of commercial
ones that are already shipping.

106
00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:39.636
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: This is just an example

107
00:06:39.636 --> 00:06:41.505
of playing around with font grade in a UI

108
00:06:41.505 --> 00:06:44.956
element.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

109
00:06:44.956 --> 00:06:47.801
giving things like a different
hover state or whatever,

110
00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:52.050
that can really help draw attention to
something without being too heavy-handed.

111
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.440
Or changing the size and
shape of the buttons.

112
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.420
And this is really just
a little bit of fun.

113
00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.710
This is Decovar in
the hands of Mandy Michael.

114
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:04.910
She's just a really fantastic
designer from Australia and

115
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.970
she did some really beautiful
experiments just animating things.

116
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:15.710
And again, maybe it's not necessarily
the most functional thing.

117
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.901
But in terms of just a way to add a little
bit more of an emotional connection,

118
00:07:19.901 --> 00:07:24.685
something that's a little bit more fun,
clearly, there's some interesting things

119
00:07:24.685 --> 00:07:28.641
that can be done.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

120
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.154
that is our brave new world.

121
00:07:31.154 --> 00:07:33.340
We're gonna start playing
around with stuff in code.
