00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.320
&gt;&gt; Jason: I wanted to start with just some
basic ideas about what we mean when we say

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.182
typography and then how you apply that
qualifier whether or not it's any good.

3
00:00:10.182 --> 00:00:16.720
So at its simplest, typography is simply

4
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.840
deciding and putting into practice what
type you are using in a given project.

5
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.061
That's the start.

6
00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:29.770
But you need to make some decisions
about how you're using it.

7
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.550
So in this example from
Keith Houston's book about the book,

8
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.650
he's made some decisions about
initial capital, the illustration,

9
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.490
the specific type face that he's using,
how we're setting it.

10
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.980
So he's justified that type, meaning,
it's got an even left and right edge.

11
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.170
If I were to say,
it's left justified, drag right.

12
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.910
That would mean it would be a little
bit uneven on the right hand side.

13
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.740
That's how most books tend to be set

14
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.399
because that keeps the space in-between
words a little bit more even.

15
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.270
He's using hyphenation, so
that you can ensure that as words break,

16
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.060
the spacing stays a little bit more even.

17
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.030
Those are all things that
are doable on the web.

18
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.820
And he's also made some decisions
about the line height, or

19
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.000
the space between each line of text.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.810
And all of those things,
including even that mark between this and

21
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.210
the next section,
that is a common typographic convention

22
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.530
to insert something between one
section of text and another.

23
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.420
So those are all decisions that Keith
made when he was designing this book, and

24
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.770
thinking through what is the system.

25
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.800
Every chapter is going to look like this.

26
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.400
There is an illustration, a large initial
capital, it's set at three stories,

27
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.330
so it's the height of three lines of text,
and then everything wraps around.

28
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.809
He's got a line height that's probably,
roughly one and

29
00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:58.260
a half times the size of the type itself.

30
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.880
That's a fairly common starting point.

31
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.870
And then he's using justification and
hyphenation.

32
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.820
So those are the rules,

33
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.330
those are the typographic conventions that
he settled on for this particular example.

34
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.600
If we look at this web site here
you can see there are certain other

35
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.818
aspects of typography that are coming
into play and one of that is,

36
00:02:20.818 --> 00:02:25.966
type face choice that relates back
to publication and the brand.

37
00:02:25.966 --> 00:02:27.915
So whether or not you read the New Yorker,

38
00:02:27.915 --> 00:02:30.990
there is a good chance that
you've seen that typeface before.

39
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.211
Even if I blocked the top of the page,

40
00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:36.876
you'd have a good chance of
knowing what publication it is.

41
00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:39.700
So that's the power of branding and type.

42
00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.330
The decisions that are made there
about hierarchy and size, and

43
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.220
you can see that there's a few different
ways that they've set this up.

44
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.450
In some cases it's all caps,
but there are different sizes.

45
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.030
In some cases they're using italics.

46
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.510
There's sans serif type going across for
the navigation.

47
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.740
All of those are decisions
about hierarchy and

48
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.510
attention that you want any
particular element to have and

49
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.130
you'll notice that just given the way
the web works, things stack down.

50
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.260
So they try not to get too hung up
on some of these things that might

51
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.250
break a little bit weirdly.

52
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.170
But that daily comment on the left with
China being alone on the last line,

53
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.910
that's one of those things that in print,
no editor would let slide.

54
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.360
It's one of the things that's harder for
people to control on the web.

55
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.070
It's not impossible it
just takes some thought

56
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.150
at the point where you're
creating the system.

57
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.324
And again this is where design systems and
typographic systems come into play.

58
00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:49.227
Where you can put some of these things
in place, baked into the CSS, and

59
00:03:49.227 --> 00:03:51.785
the JavaScript for the site itself.

60
00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:55.892
So that it's not about what you do
during the content publishing process,

61
00:03:55.892 --> 00:03:58.954
it's just always there any
time you create a new story,

62
00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:02.170
any time you publish new content
these rules get applied.

63
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.140
That's the beauty of CSS.

64
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.270
We want to make sure that all
the things that we're doing today

65
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.710
are not things that require that you go
wrap the first letter with a span and

66
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.850
add a specific class or
anything like that.

67
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.012
None of that stuff is necessary.

68
00:04:17.012 --> 00:04:22.165
And some of the other things
that you can get out of great

69
00:04:22.165 --> 00:04:26.997
typography are a reminiscence to a time or
a place.

70
00:04:26.997 --> 00:04:30.240
So this is not an old piece of work.

71
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.080
It certainly doesn't date back to
the 20's but it feels like it.

72
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.030
Because of the choices that have
been made in the typography.

73
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.400
So when you look at this, now this is for

74
00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.440
something that, well it's 1990,
so not that new, but

75
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.950
certainly not as old as the feeling
that you get from looking at this.

76
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.350
That's the power of typography and
typeface choice.

77
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.270
It can evoke a place in time.

78
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.820
It can evoke a particular style.

79
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.900
It can give you a feeling, even if I say,
a jazz poster, you're probably gonna get

80
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.610
an image of musical notes in a particular
sort of whimsical way of setting type.

81
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.180
Or if I say in a western,
or like the old west,

82
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.520
you might have something
else that comes to mind.

83
00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.740
Those letter forms are very powerful ways
for us to make an emotional connection.

84
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.250
Between the viewer and the content or the
company that you're trying to represent.

85
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.750
Now this one is an example of another

86
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.150
page that we're going to be
looking at playing around with.

87
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.260
I did my best to try and
create a typography for

88
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.790
this that is reminiscent of
something written in the 30's.

89
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.770
And I don't know that it's entirely
successful, but I think looking at some

90
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.530
of the covers and other things in context,
I think it comes relatively close.

91
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.310
But it's got a lot of similar techniques
in terms of the initial capital,

92
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.400
some of the decisions about line length
and size, and relative hierarchy.

93
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.570
And you can see how it scales nicely
going from one screen size to the other.

94
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.350
A lot of these things still
work pretty nicely, and

95
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.810
that's what I mean about being
able to do these things on screen,

96
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.560
as well as, or in some cases, even better
than you can necessarily do in print.

97
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.680
One of the things that is a little
bit harder to notice here,

98
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.520
I'm gonna show it in greater detail.

99
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.040
But if you look at
the headline on the left, and

100
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:34.570
look at the lowercase y in crystal, and
the lower case g at the end of printing.

101
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.990
Look at the depth of the descenders.

102
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.310
The parts of the character
that drop down below.

103
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.170
And then look at the headline on the
right, and what you'll notice is that one,

104
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.080
they're a little bit thicker, so you
don't lose the fine detail when it gets

105
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:54.050
physically smaller and they're also
shallower so they don't collide.

106
00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.790
And if I didn't apply some of the things
we can do with variable fonts,

107
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:00.740
we wouldn't get as nice a headline.

108
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.970
And if we were doing this in print, where
we don't have access to some of these

109
00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.470
features, I wouldn't be able to set
the headline that tightly on a small size.

110
00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.740
So, this is where we're getting into
some things that are actually possible

111
00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.856
because we are working on the web.

112
00:07:15.856 --> 00:07:20.730
And I think, that's really powerful, and
really interesting it's far a point in

113
00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:26.530
time and place,
as someone who really loves type,

114
00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.340
I can actually do my best work here,
better than I can do on paper.
