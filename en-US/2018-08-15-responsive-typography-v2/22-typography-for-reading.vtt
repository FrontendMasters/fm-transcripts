00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.840
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So now that
we've got the web fonts loaded in,

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.580
now we wanna make sure that we're
doing something with them to provide

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.270
the best possible reading experience.

4
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.350
So it may be overstating it a little bit
to say it's the absolute perfect page,

5
00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.220
but I've tried to kind of put
as many different techniques and

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.100
tricks and little bits of
finesse in here as possible.

7
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.920
So the first thing we're gonna look at
is thinking through that proportion and

8
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.340
scale in the way that
I have been doing it,

9
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.870
which is by setting up several break
points and different sizes along the way.

10
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.250
And then also looking at how that
might work using this newer method,

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.670
using CSS variables and calculations.

12
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.200
So it looks something like this,

13
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.330
where designed from mobile first,
so the smallest one is up top.

14
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.393
What is the font size,
and the line height, and

15
00:00:58.393 --> 00:01:02.769
margins to get the effect that I was
looking for on the small screen.

16
00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.730
And then once it reached a minimum
with the 43 and three-quarters ems,

17
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.620
which is somewhere in the neighborhood
of 800 pixels or so, I think.

18
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.970
The font size bumps up to 2.5
letter spacing is normal,

19
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.240
line height is a little bit greater,
it's a little bit smaller, excuse me.

20
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.496
And then margins are offset
a little bit differently,

21
00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:33.378
and then once you get onto more a desktop
sized screen, more in the neighborhood of

22
00:01:33.378 --> 00:01:38.434
900 to 1000 pixels, then it's up to 3 or
3 times the size of body copy.

23
00:01:38.434 --> 00:01:43.609
Letter spacing again is normal and
line height is different again,

24
00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.144
and so on and so on,
as many breakpoints as you really need to

25
00:01:48.144 --> 00:01:52.660
define to get the design
looking the way you want.

26
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.510
And that's usually paired with
h2s that stay in context, and

27
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.160
h3s that stay in context.

28
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.650
Always looking at, what is the minimum
size that you want it to be on

29
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.030
the small screen and the maximum size, and
then just picking the values in between so

30
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.880
that everything kinda grows and
scales together.

31
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.220
But if you start to think about all
the extra stuff that goes along with this

32
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.760
if you have the H1 and two or
three or four breakpoints and

33
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.110
you wanna style the fall backs at
each one of those breakpoints,

34
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.970
there's a lot of CSS to maintain,
so it really does start to add up.

35
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.630
And I've done it before and
it's certainly possible to do.

36
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.740
And SASS does make it
a little bit simpler to write

37
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.370
because you can keep
everything nested together.

38
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.470
But it's a little cumbersome,

39
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.520
so as you want to create more
intermediate break points for

40
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.740
more different classes of devices, then it
does really get a little bit out of hand.

41
00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:56.930
So it would be nice to have a little
bit easier way of dealing with it.

42
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.560
So with a variable font and

43
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.700
using this technique,
we can simplify things a little bit.

44
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.410
One thing I want to point out, the syntax
for writing the @font-face declaration

45
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.540
at the moment is really no different
than using a non-variable font.

46
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:23.510
It's supposed to be truetype-variations or
waf or waf2-variations.

47
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.100
It's just not implemented
in all the browsers yet.

48
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.010
So there are some bits of this
where this is how it is now,

49
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.580
this is kinda how it's supposed to be.

50
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.750
You have to test and

51
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.470
look in a couple different browsers
to see what the state of support is.

52
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.470
But then you can go about writing
your CSS in a relatively normal way.

53
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.130
And if it sort of falls
outside the bounds of those

54
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.840
few different things that
you might want to declare,

55
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.240
then you can use font variation
settings to specify them all together.

56
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.200
One thing that's worth pointing out,
I don't know if I said this earlier,

57
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.620
the registered axes need to be lowercase.

58
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.340
For those four letter abbreviations,
custom axes need to be in all capitals.

59
00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.380
They will not work if you don't.

60
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.760
I think they might work in one browser but
they're not supposed to.

61
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.530
Generally speaking,

62
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.670
they probably won't work in the majority
of browsers if you get that wrong.

63
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.253
There's really only five at the moment,
width,

64
00:04:27.253 --> 00:04:32.217
weight,
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Width, weight,

65
00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:37.580
stretch, oblique, and, well,
slant, and optical size.

66
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.190
Those are the only ones
that you might use.
