00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.310
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: This
is another example.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.540
This is one that I gave you a link to and
it's also in this project.

3
00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.020
This is the one,
the page I designed for monotype.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.732
And this one is playing around with
a single font, regular italic,

5
00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:20.732
and a weight range that
goes from 100 to 900.

6
00:00:22.783 --> 00:00:25.450
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And I'm using
almost all of those throughout this.

7
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.510
So what I wanted to point out
here is that going from that 100

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.680
weight all the way to 900,
by also then playing with the font size,

9
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.500
you can still make something very
readable by just making it really big.

10
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.260
So you can really create
a lot of strong variation and

11
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.160
kind of visual dynamics just by
varying the weight and the size.

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.190
That scale change really can vary
the design and the feeling of it.

13
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.811
And when you see this in code, you'll see
that it actually does scale really nicely

14
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:01.810
down onto the small screen as well.

15
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.521
So in this design I was working through,

16
00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.340
they've got some ligatures here and
kerning.

17
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.886
We've got a lot of different weights.

18
00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:12.307
We've a got little different
techniques in here,

19
00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:14.610
where I've got the large initial capital.

20
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.150
The first line of the paragraph
is slightly heavier, so

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.010
it's slightly bolder
than the text around it.

22
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.870
We have a big pull quote down here
that's set in italics, much larger and

23
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.100
much lighter.

24
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.440
It also does things on the screen.

25
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.090
When it gets smaller, it makes that really
lightweight text a little bit heavier,

26
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.960
because as that scales down in font size,

27
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.850
it actually gets a little bit
harder to read at that 100 weight.

28
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.480
But I'm able to bump it to just 150 or

29
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.870
175 rather than having to
go up a substantial weight.

30
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.010
And visually it still looks
pretty much the same,

31
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.320
still has that same kind of feeling.

32
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.177
So I've tried to layer in as many
different typographic techniques

33
00:01:57.177 --> 00:02:01.433
as I can here just to sort of show
how much we can do in pixels,

34
00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:05.459
similar to the kinds of things
that we would do on paper.

35
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:10.160
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So let's take a look
at some of those details in action.

36
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.363
I wanna show you again
this page with Plex.

37
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:23.288
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: This one, I've kind
of removed all of the scaling, so

38
00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:25.440
you can kind of see how well or

39
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.236
poorly this behaves when you don't have
any of that modular scale built in.

40
00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:36.860
But if I load up a page
from the next section,

41
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.480
this is one where I've added
the pixel values in, so

42
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.080
this is not using the formula.

43
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.177
If you take a look at
the 06-plex-styles-rwt

44
00:02:51.177 --> 00:02:58.443
versus the 05-plex styles,
this one is really simple.

45
00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:03.490
It just has one font size,
it doesn't change.

46
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.420
If we look at the one that's set
up to deal with the scaling,

47
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.216
you can see that there's a lot more to it.

48
00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:15.730
There are breakpoints here that
are affecting the line height and

49
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.590
font size, and it's also dealing with
all of the inactive classes as well.

50
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.260
So that way, it's trying to factor in
the loading process across any device.

51
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.870
So when we look at that in the browser and
turn stuff on and off, it's pretty close.

52
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.110
And it stays pretty close even as
you get into a smaller screen,

53
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.273
but you can see everything's
kinda scaling down.

54
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.589
And you can see the negative
margin is gone here.

55
00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:52.032
Whereas on a larger screen where I know
that I have the room, this actually

56
00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:56.480
kinda sticks out, and creates a little
bit more of an editorial effect.

57
00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.541
And that's all using CSS shape-outside,
which is a really nifty little property.

58
00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:06.721
And just in the CSS I define
a polygon around the glass, so

59
00:04:06.721 --> 00:04:09.720
that way the text will wrap around it.

60
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.347
And it gives it a little bit more of
an interesting kind of polished look,

61
00:04:13.347 --> 00:04:15.137
more like you'd see in a magazine.

62
00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:22.691
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So those two files
will give you a sense of going from,

63
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.472
the fonts are being loaded well,

64
00:04:25.472 --> 00:04:30.930
but we're not really doing
anything about scaling them.

65
00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.617
And then when we do want to scale them,
we add in those media queries.

66
00:04:35.617 --> 00:04:40.417
We preserve the fallback styling so
that stuff comes along with it, and

67
00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:44.339
the same thing is happening
here when you get into the h1.

68
00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:48.595
You see a few different breakpoints
where we're changing font-size,

69
00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:51.677
max-width, and line-height,
and h2s as well.

70
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:59.620
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So that's using
kind of the new old school way.

71
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.672
And if we wanna look at sort
of the newer new school,

72
00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:11.382
we can take a look at another one of
the pages in that part six folder.

73
00:05:11.382 --> 00:05:16.090
So this is the one that we've
been seeing lots of pictures of.

74
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.720
This is using Amstelvar.

75
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.880
And it's got all of the scaling tricks and
techniques in there so

76
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.960
everything is animating and
changing with optical size.

77
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.270
You can see a couple things missing
out here, where you are getting some

78
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.810
of those collisions here
between those letter forms.

79
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.832
So that's some stuff that we can improve.

80
00:05:42.243 --> 00:05:44.460
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: We're kinda getting
ahead of ourselves a little bit though.

81
00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.040
And then the other one that's in this
folder that you can take a look at.

82
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.525
Now we can see this working
in the browser, and

83
00:05:56.525 --> 00:06:02.020
see how this moves and
scales as things get smaller.

84
00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.648
And I set this up to do things
a little bit differently, and

85
00:06:04.648 --> 00:06:07.181
kind of lighten up this text and
just let it flow behind.
