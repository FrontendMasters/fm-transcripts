1
00:00:02.728 --> 00:00:04.944
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: I'm Jason Pamental.

2
00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:08.954
We were talking a little bit right
before we got started about why

3
00:00:08.954 --> 00:00:13.210
I didn't know anything about
a raccoon scaling a building.

4
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.180
And part of that is because I get
a little bit obsessed with this stuff.

5
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.900
And I'll tell you a little bit
more about that in a second.

6
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.230
Just a quick look ahead.

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.733
These are as close as possible to kind of
the things that we're gonna talk about and

8
00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:33.104
roughly the time that
we're gonna spend on them.

9
00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:38.081
I am gonna be covering some of the similar
concepts that I did in the first edition

10
00:00:38.081 --> 00:00:42.710
of this workshop because a lot of
that stuff is still very relevant.

11
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.730
It's the application of it and some of the
new technologies that we're gonna get into

12
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.300
that will help us take it a lot further.

13
00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.270
But we're gonna go over
some basics of typography.

14
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.700
So for the people who are watching, or are
in the room that have never studied type,

15
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.540
I'm gonna try and give you some
basics about what to look for.

16
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.284
How to look at type,
how to see some of the differences and

17
00:01:05.284 --> 00:01:09.496
what kinda choices you might make
when you're working with it.

18
00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:13.520
I'm gonna talk a little about what I
mean when I say responsive typography.

19
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.030
I actually wrote a book about it.

20
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.760
About the time that I gave this
workshop the last time it was just out.

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.470
And there's a new wrinkle to that.

22
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.500
It's not just responsive typography,
we also have responsive type,

23
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.070
which is really pretty fascinating stuff
and I'm really super excited about it.

24
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.070
So I'm looking forward
to showing that to you.

25
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.930
We'll have a break for

26
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.630
lunch and then we're gonna get
into implementing web fonts.

27
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.600
And we're gonna talk about how to do
that for the best performance and

28
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.810
best user experience and different things
and techniques that you can try there.

29
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.701
And also talk a little bit
about what the W3C and

30
00:01:48.701 --> 00:01:53.400
a couple other companies are working on,
because there's some interesting

31
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.811
developments that are just
starting to become a thing.

32
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:00.787
And then we're gonna talk a little bit
more about some different aspects of

33
00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:01.608
typography and

34
00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:05.599
how we can use these technologies to
improve overall reading experience.

35
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.760
Finessing things with some
of the finer details, and

36
00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.410
then look at some newer ideas in
editorial design where we can look at

37
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.560
how we could take web design a little
further than what you might typically see.

38
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.320
And use some of this new technology
to create a much more Interesting and

39
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.910
dynamic impact on the web.

40
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.708
And have it all, of course, work across
any device that you could think of.

41
00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:36.551
And then we're going to try to finish up
with enough time so that we can go and

42
00:02:36.551 --> 00:02:38.400
look at some real world examples.

43
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.861
And if anybody has a particular
project that they're working on, or

44
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.903
they're curious about,
we can pull a couple things up, and

45
00:02:44.903 --> 00:02:46.946
we'll just kind of take that as it goes.

46
00:02:48.395 --> 00:02:51.770
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Questions are welcome
at any point during the day.

47
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.420
This will go back and
forth between looking at some slides and

48
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.880
looking at some code and
working through stuff.

49
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.460
You have the exact same repository
that I'm gonna be working with here.

50
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.190
It's up on GitHub.

51
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.060
You are welcome to do whatever
you wanna do with that.

52
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.860
And code along if you want to, or

53
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.890
just know that you have all the answers
there and you can always come back to it.

54
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.231
It's totally up to you.

55
00:03:19.516 --> 00:03:22.577
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And then by the time
we're really exhausted, by around five,

56
00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.864
then we'll just go away.

57
00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:28.840
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: As I mentioned,
my name's Jason.

58
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.140
I tend to refer to myself
as a web typographer.

59
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.540
And I do that at type conferences,

60
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.110
in order to differentiate myself from
people that I feel totally outclassed by,

61
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.140
because they know a lot more
about traditional type than I do.

62
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.390
But I know a lot more about how to
implement it well on the web, and

63
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.670
what's why I think there's
an important distinction.

64
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.300
So while I'm many things,
I'm a teacher, an author, a writer,

65
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.910
a developer, a designer, a strategist.

66
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.717
I really kinda like this label because I
think it actually encapsulates an awful

67
00:04:04.717 --> 00:04:05.513
lot of that.

68
00:04:07.792 --> 00:04:11.256
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: The best thing I can
say about a four year old web book is that

69
00:04:11.256 --> 00:04:14.673
at least it's still somewhat or
maybe mostly relevant.

70
00:04:14.673 --> 00:04:18.360
So I'm happy about that, but
it could certainly use an update.

71
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.357
Although given the state of things right
now, between now and the end of the year,

72
00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:25.240
it's gonna be so different yet

73
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.091
again that it's probably not
worth starting on that just yet.

74
00:04:29.091 --> 00:04:33.222
I mentioned that I kind of missed out
on a lot of pop culture stuff because I

75
00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:37.530
tend to go around and speak about
these sorts of things quite a lot.

76
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.430
And so last week I was out at Adobe at

77
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.680
San Francisco giving a talk at their
internal conference about variable fonts.

78
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.750
And how that might fit
into teaching typography

79
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.590
to people who really don't know anything
about it, whether it's online or

80
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.590
in print, because it can remove some
of the choices that you have to make.

81
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.810
If anybody's ever installed a typeface
before, it's a whole bunch of files.

82
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.130
Every different width, weight,
italic, they're all separate files.

83
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.476
And all have to be imported, managed,
and if you're missing one or two,

84
00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:15.384
then the job doesn't go right.

85
00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:18.110
And I think that's where variable
fonts can actually start to

86
00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.070
make a difference there.

87
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.780
So it was really interesting getting
a chance to see where Adobe's

88
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.460
going with that.

89
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.860
I've talked to a lot of
other teams at GoDaddy,

90
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.820
at Audible, Conde Nast, a few other places
about what they're doing with type and

91
00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.320
how this might fit into their needs.

92
00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.000
Whether it's about branding or if it's
about just increasing overall performance

93
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.970
or creating greater flexibility for
the content management process.

94
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.840
That's the kinda thing I
spend a lot of time doing.

95
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.945
And I was interested enough
in trying to focus on that,

96
00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:55.263
that about two weeks ago I quit the agency
job that I had running a development

97
00:05:55.263 --> 00:05:58.320
team at a Drupal shop to focus
on this stuff full time.

98
00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.171
So you have my full attention.

99
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:05.652
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: To set
things off on the right note,

100
00:06:05.652 --> 00:06:09.020
that's Tristan on the left and
Tilly on the right.

101
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.090
I've had Tristan since he was a puppy.

102
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:16.130
He's about to turn ten, and Tilly,
his cousin, is just turning eight.

103
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.130
And we've had her for
about a year and a half.

104
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.530
I will definitely be leaning on them to
help me explain some type terms as we go,

105
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.380
but that's also our calming touchpoint.

106
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.950
We'll probably see them coming back into
the scene a few times here and there.
