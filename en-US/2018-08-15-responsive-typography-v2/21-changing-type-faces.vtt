00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.450
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: This really kind of
covers the basics of adding this in here.

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.730
If we wanted to change the typefaces
that are being called here,

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.380
it actually would be
relatively easy to do.

4
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.610
We could go to Google.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: You

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.200
could really kind of pick anything.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.130
So, if we wanted to
change it from Plex to,

7
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.320
I don't know,
Merriweather that's a nice type face.

8
00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.640
And down here customize it, so we can get
regular italic and bold and bold italic.

9
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:48.522
And this will give us this link to CSS.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So

10
00:00:48.522 --> 00:00:52.110
if all I did was going here.

11
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.899
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Come on and

12
00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:04.514
instead of this file, paste in this,

13
00:01:04.514 --> 00:01:09.610
and change this to Merriweather.

14
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.752
And then if I were to go in and

15
00:01:16.752 --> 00:01:22.262
change this also.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Let's

16
00:01:22.262 --> 00:01:23.840
make sure I have that naming right.

17
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.090
So let's go back over and
check, yep, Merriweather.

18
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.700
Save that, if I go back and
reload that page, it's

19
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.570
probably just the body copy that's
gonna change because I didn't get the,

20
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.659
I didn't change the headers.

21
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.766
So you can see how long it was taking
to load that type face because I still

22
00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:56.338
have that band width throttled but I can
easily go and change that as well here.

23
00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.760
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So let me close that

24
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.949
out, so we don't have to have

25
00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:18.146
the artificial throttling.

26
00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:22.844
But, so this is now rendering in

27
00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:28.336
Merriweather.
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And

28
00:02:28.336 --> 00:02:31.070
it's using the same process.

29
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.960
So, if we check under the network tab and
look at the fonts that are loading.

30
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.610
So you can hover over these things and

31
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.860
it'll show you that it's
coming from Google.

32
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.610
So you can see that they're
actually loading properly.

33
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.160
So it's really easy to change that code,

34
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.980
which you drop in from whatever
service you're loading things from.

35
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.650
The rest of this stuff works
in exactly the same manner.

36
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.369
So obviously, there would be
a few things that would be off.

37
00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:05.500
Like toggling the web fonts on and off.

38
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.910
You can see it's not tuned for
Merriweather.

39
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.370
So I have to kind of go back and
do that same little tweaking but

40
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.900
it would be just a few values to shift.

41
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.170
You can see the H1 is
actually relatively close.

42
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.520
Little bit of horizontal spacing but

43
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.880
it would be pretty close to
occupying the same space.

44
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.250
So this framework is
actually pretty solid.

45
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.990
You'd be able to copy and paste a lot of
the same stuff into any other project and

46
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.290
then just change out the source of
the fonts that you want to load.
