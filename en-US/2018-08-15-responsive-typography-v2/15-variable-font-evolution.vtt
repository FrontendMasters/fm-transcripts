&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: In the PDF of
these slides, those links are active.

2
00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.470
This is really important.

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.420
How many people here were aware that the
W3C has all of their support issues, and

4
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.340
discussion on Github?

5
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.790
How many people are Github users?

6
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.740
Right, so that means all of
you can go participate here.

7
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.820
So if you have questions,
that's where the speck is being discussed.

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.700
That's where new features are being
fleshed out and worked on.

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.047
There's used cases,
there's tests, there's places for

10
00:00:34.047 --> 00:00:38.664
you to say, hey, this is working
in a weird way in this browser.

11
00:00:38.664 --> 00:00:40.750
What am I seeing here?

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.210
Am I seeing something that's
a gap in the spec, or

13
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.180
am I seeing something that's
a gap in implementation.

14
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.195
There are people from
every browser team there,

15
00:00:48.195 --> 00:00:50.960
there're people from
every type company there.

16
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.050
People from the W3C, it's really active.

17
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.870
There's great discussion going on.

18
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.890
And this is the point in time where we
actually get to shape how the web works.

19
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.610
So I was fortunate enough, three weeks
after variable fonts were announced,

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.080
a guy on the Apple web kit team
sent me a link to a nightly build.

21
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.780
I was showing off variable fonts
in a browser the next day.

22
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.790
So I mean this stuff, it got started
quickly, and it's really been evolving

23
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.410
heavily, I've had plenty of opportunities
to actually sit in on W3C meetings.

24
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.810
Talk to the browser vendors,
talk to the type designers.

25
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.575
This is a very active time, and you have
every bit as much a say in this, as I do.

26
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:39.015
I'm simply just try things out,
go here, read up on what's going on,

27
00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:42.345
see if there's anything
that is interesting to you,

28
00:01:42.345 --> 00:01:46.860
there are lots of new developments
in how CSS is being implemented.

29
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.240
There's also now a discussion of
how do we handle partial downloads.

30
00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.400
So there is this idea of,
it's sort of like font streaming.

31
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.530
Sort of like progressive download or

32
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.350
sort of rehydration, in that,
if you dynamically subset one page, and

33
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.820
you deliver only the characters needed to
render that page, and then, go to another

34
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.650
page, then, it's gonna send a little bit
more to you, and then, a little bit more.

35
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130
So you don't actually have to
download the whole font at once.

36
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.190
Now, that's actually behind the scenes.

37
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.680
It's already being done in some browser,

38
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.160
with some font services, primarily,
with CGK, or like Japanese, or

39
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.860
Korean, or Chinese language fonts,
because those character sets are so big.

40
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.320
Those fonts might be several megabytes,
so they have to do something like that.

41
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.000
But there are those same companies are now
getting together to work with the W3C

42
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.040
on a way that we could do this for
any webpage,

43
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.905
and if you start to think about those
implications of variable fonts, dynamic

44
00:02:48.905 --> 00:02:54.230
sub-setting, and then, progressively
downloading more and more of it.

45
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.700
There's zero reason why we
wouldn't be using these fonts, and

46
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.570
every reason why we would.

47
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.590
Because we have our voice,
and our brand, and

48
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.050
our experience,
that gets tied up with the content itself.

49
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.720
And those things can then
always travel together,

50
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.090
without fear of negatively
impacting the experience.
