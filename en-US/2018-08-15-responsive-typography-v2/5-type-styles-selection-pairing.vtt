00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.120
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: So there are a few
other kinds of classifications that you

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.130
will see.

3
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.530
Serif and
sans-serif are kinda the easy ones.

4
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.720
Slab serif, we tend to see a lot of.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.620
Ever since web fonts became popular,
the two runaway favorites,

6
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.490
when web fonts first came on the scene,
was Museo and Museo Slab.

7
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.940
And those were type faces that
worked beautifully together.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.950
One was a sans-serif,

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.110
one was a nicer of heavy slab serif which
works really nicely for large headlines.

10
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.370
Monospaced is what you see
in your code editors and

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.080
that is exactly what it means,
every letter takes up the same space.

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.288
So it's a lot easier for

13
00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:43.169
you to read things in a more consistent
manner when you're looking at code.

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.523
Display type faces is
a bit of a catch all,

15
00:00:47.523 --> 00:00:52.332
that really just means ones that
are generally better at large size.

16
00:00:52.332 --> 00:00:57.333
So something that's really
specifically designed as a display

17
00:00:57.333 --> 00:01:02.887
face might really only work at say 24 or
36 or 48 points or pixels,

18
00:01:02.887 --> 00:01:09.484
as opposed to being really readable for
body copy, which might be rendered at 16.

19
00:01:09.484 --> 00:01:14.330
Script, really popular on
wedding invitations and

20
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.419
lots of other printed material.

21
00:01:17.419 --> 00:01:22.918
Not quite as popular on the web but
you still can use them to great effect and

22
00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:25.857
there are a lot of really interesting.

23
00:01:25.857 --> 00:01:30.455
Ones that are somewhere between a script
typeface and something handwritten,

24
00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:32.665
generally referred to as lettering.

25
00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:37.817
But I met a woman, Jess McCarty,
who has a type foundry

26
00:01:37.817 --> 00:01:42.580
that really just focuses
on lettering fonts.

27
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.490
And she makes web versions of them, and
they're available all over the place.

28
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.056
Magpie Paperworks, she really does
some beautiful, beautiful work.

29
00:01:52.056 --> 00:01:55.982
And that can really create
a really interesting effect,

30
00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:58.366
when used sparingly, on the web.

31
00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:01.633
You wouldn't necessarily want to
have your body copy in it, but

32
00:02:01.633 --> 00:02:05.627
drawing people in with something that
looks really unique and interesting and

33
00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:08.730
really different from what
you'd see somewhere else.

34
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.086
It works great on the chalk art
that you see outside stores.

35
00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:17.099
There's no reason that it can't be
effective when you're using it on the web.

36
00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.600
Blackletter probably not the most
common choice to use on the web.

37
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.337
Basically if you look at
the name of many newspapers,

38
00:02:25.337 --> 00:02:29.572
it's set in some form of
blackletter like in New York Times,

39
00:02:29.572 --> 00:02:33.247
in the Washington Post and
then handwriting is one.

40
00:02:33.247 --> 00:02:38.421
I had to make sure that
it's not Comic Sans because

41
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:42.865
that's really just not worth including.

42
00:02:42.865 --> 00:02:44.969
So some other type examples.

43
00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.869
Things that you can look for are,

44
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:54.650
you notice on the left, it's very stable.

45
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.779
It's very centered, very heavy,
it's all about buying war bonds.

46
00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.790
So this is about relating to the content.

47
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.181
So when you think about what you're
working on, again good type decisions that

48
00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:12.439
like, good type decisions, it's one
thing to simply have a nice pair of type

49
00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.795
faces or fonts that work well together,
but do they relate?

50
00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:18.527
Are they adding to and
amplifying the message?

51
00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:22.630
So, buying war bonds was a serious thing.

52
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.738
So this was probably back in the 30s,
when that was designed.

53
00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:32.093
And that was the whole goal, it's
a serious thing, we want you to do this,

54
00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:37.280
we need your support, we need you to
help support the coming war effort.

55
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.280
As opposed to the right,
which is far more whimsical and playful.

56
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.700
It's all about buying a bike.

57
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.750
So you can see this
totally different mood and

58
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.170
totally different style that's imparted
when you look at the left and the right.

59
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.998
And I think that if you want interesting
type inspiration, go google vintage

60
00:03:56.998 --> 00:04:01.989
posters, and just start looking at things
through different periods in time.

61
00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.887
It really does give you a great look into
what are some of the common themes and

62
00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:09.739
trends in typography.

63
00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.100
Will give you a lot of inspiration,
also for color palette, too.

64
00:04:14.644 --> 00:04:19.116
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: Again, this is another
one that really relates to time and place.

65
00:04:19.116 --> 00:04:23.149
These travel posters that I found for
Miami and

66
00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:27.804
Cuba, a lot of them were
very specific to the 20s and

67
00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:33.740
30s that was very kind of a big time for
that kind of tourism.

68
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.772
So it really did evoke that
sort of somewhat art deco, but

69
00:04:37.772 --> 00:04:42.393
a little bit beachy kind of feel
that's very particular to design

70
00:04:42.393 --> 00:04:46.019
that you would see from Miami and
Cuba in that time.

71
00:04:49.452 --> 00:04:50.633
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: And then place.

72
00:04:50.633 --> 00:04:53.853
It's hard to imagine something written and

73
00:04:53.853 --> 00:04:58.301
designed in type set that way,
not being related to France.

74
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.623
There's just something about
that kind of style that is very

75
00:05:02.623 --> 00:05:05.005
evocative of the time and place.

76
00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:09.821
So these are just a few different examples
that I wanted to show you that power

77
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:13.540
that you can get from making
great typeface choices.

78
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.960
They may not be the things that you do
necessarily on the web, but you can.

79
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.012
There's no reason why if
working on a project for

80
00:05:21.012 --> 00:05:25.330
a company that has a particular
relationship, if you're working on

81
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.438
a company that the founders are Dutch,
look at Dutch typefaces.

82
00:05:29.438 --> 00:05:31.002
There's a lot of really beautiful ones.

83
00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:33.750
Look at some of the color palettes.

84
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.817
I did some design work for

85
00:05:35.817 --> 00:05:41.149
a friend of mine who was trying to
start a cycling villa in Spain.

86
00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:45.996
So I bought a book on Spanish graphic
design, and looked at the typefaces and

87
00:05:45.996 --> 00:05:47.370
the type designers.

88
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.483
I looked at the color palettes.

89
00:05:48.483 --> 00:05:50.902
All of those things were, kind of,

90
00:05:50.902 --> 00:05:55.674
my way in to see a culture that I
didn't really have any connection to.

91
00:05:55.674 --> 00:06:00.290
So those are just some different avenues,
whether or

92
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:05.840
not you've been gone and
studied design, anybody can do this.

93
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.670
Doing a little bit of googling to see,

94
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.040
google type designers from this area or
this decade.

95
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.016
You'll find stuff online.

96
00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:18.249
It'll start to give you a sense of
how to make these connections and

97
00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.571
make the type relevant to the thing
that you're putting out there.

98
00:06:22.571 --> 00:06:28.215
And now again just looking at how
you would pair them together,

99
00:06:28.215 --> 00:06:33.009
these two typefaces similar
to what we were looking at

100
00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.589
with that type anatomy slide,
very similar top and

101
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:41.440
bottom in overall geometric proportion.

102
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.558
This is also designed by the same person.

103
00:06:44.558 --> 00:06:48.788
That's another really easy way to look for
typefaces that will go well together,

104
00:06:48.788 --> 00:06:50.701
even though it might not be obvious.

105
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:55.614
If they're drawn by the same hand, they're
going to be some inherent similarities,

106
00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:58.508
things that might not be
obvious on the surface, so

107
00:06:58.508 --> 00:07:02.511
even in Google fonts you can figure
out who designed a given typeface.

108
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:04.372
Go look at some other
things that they designed.

109
00:07:04.372 --> 00:07:07.651
And you might see some pairings that
would be a little bit unexpected.

110
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:11.889
So down below is Avante Garde,
above is Lubalin Graph.

111
00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.122
It was designed by Herb Lubalin, I think
about ten years apart, but one clearly

112
00:07:17.122 --> 00:07:22.449
grew out of the other, and that's why I
think they work really nicely together.

113
00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:27.795
This is another example
that actually comes from,

114
00:07:27.795 --> 00:07:33.514
I guess 1930s,
I think it was a Lincoln brochure,

115
00:07:33.514 --> 00:07:38.920
and this was a pairing of Futura and
Bodoni.

116
00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:44.121
So, Futura was this very sort of
futuristic art deco, kind of modernist

117
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:49.837
Sans Serif that you can see in the top
headline, where Bodoni has been around for

118
00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:54.043
centuries and
it's this really classic serif typeface.

119
00:07:54.043 --> 00:07:57.861
But they use them together really
effectively, and that's, I think,

120
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:01.426
a good example of what you can look
at when you start to work on your own

121
00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:03.257
projects to get a sense of things.

122
00:08:03.257 --> 00:08:07.445
You don't have to go with
kind of the web expected

123
00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:11.800
Slab Serif headline and
San Serif body copy.

124
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.060
The screens are really good,

125
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.870
the phones we have in our pocket
have 300 points per inch.

126
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.065
The screens that we have on our
laptops are nearly as high res so

127
00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:21.163
they can draw the shapes really nicely.

128
00:08:21.163 --> 00:08:25.699
There's no need to shy away from
having a more delicate typeface for

129
00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:30.573
the body copy, because it will kind
of read very nicely on a good screen.

130
00:08:30.573 --> 00:08:35.661
And the thing about Serifs,
when that's what we're used to looking at,

131
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:37.990
is it connects the letters.

132
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:40.787
Those Serifs kinda create
a joining between them so

133
00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:43.388
it actually will flow
a little bit more easily,

134
00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:47.699
and really kind of help you kind of move
along the line of text and take it all in.

135
00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:53.022
So when used effectively, a Serif for
body copy can be really quite elegant.

136
00:08:56.778 --> 00:08:59.704
&gt;&gt; Jason Pamental: You
can get fonts anywhere.

137
00:08:59.704 --> 00:09:02.801
A lot of people just
directly go to Google and

138
00:09:02.801 --> 00:09:06.210
that's what they look
at are the free ones.

139
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.650
But fonts.com, Typekit,
MyFonts, TypeNetwork,

140
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:16.833
they all have pretty accessible,
pretty inexpensive licenses for fonts.

141
00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:21.855
So there's no reason why when
somebody is spending a big chunk of

142
00:09:21.855 --> 00:09:28.000
money on getting a website or an app done,
find out what their brand fonts are.

143
00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.019
Find out if they're available.

144
00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:34.624
Make sure you keep that consistency rather
than just going with something that kind

145
00:09:34.624 --> 00:09:36.000
of looks like it.

146
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.115
Because chances are it's available.

147
00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:41.926
Adobe is what's behind Typekit,
Monotype is who's behind Fonts.com.

148
00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:45.510
Those are the two largest
type companies in the world.

149
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.066
It's almost unheard of for

150
00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:51.272
a typeface used in a company brand to
not actually be available on the web.

151
00:09:51.272 --> 00:09:54.475
And don't just go by whatever
style guide they hand you,

152
00:09:54.475 --> 00:09:58.680
because most style guides these days
have not actually been written to take

153
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.010
into account that you can
use real type on the web.

154
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:07.500
A lot of them will still say here's what
we use in print, just use Arial over here.

155
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.500
We need to put Arial out to pasture, we
need to actually embrace using the brand

156
00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.690
type face because that's
what builds a connection.

157
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:19.663
That's what will create that
unconscious tie between the user and

158
00:10:19.663 --> 00:10:25.347
the organization or the brand that will
build that emotional connection and

159
00:10:25.347 --> 00:10:29.362
keep people coming back and
really set things apart.

160
00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:33.874
And so, we went from millions
of websites using Arial to

161
00:10:33.874 --> 00:10:36.950
millions of website using Open Sans.

00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:41.597
It's not that I don't like Open Sans,
it's a well done typeface, but

163
00:10:41.597 --> 00:10:45.857
if everybody is using the same thing,
that is the simplest way for

164
00:10:45.857 --> 00:10:49.904
you to stand out, is to use
something a little bit different.

165
00:10:49.904 --> 00:10:55.262
As I said, most of the techniques that
we use in print are available in CSS and

166
00:10:55.262 --> 00:10:59.310
even some things that
we can only do digital.

167
00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:03.240
So now we'll start to look at actually how
some of these things are implemented and

168
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.100
see some stuff on screen and in code.
