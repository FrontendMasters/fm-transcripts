00:00:00.088 --> 00:00:02.420
&gt;&gt; Jason: This is actually set up so

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.419
that if the browser does
not support variable fonts,

3
00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.544
then it won't load it, and
it will load Fira instead.

4
00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:15.380
And then it will put up this message.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.580
I should be able to pull this page
up in the normal version of Firefox.

6
00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.386
If I quit out of that,
I forced this version of Firefox to not

7
00:00:24.386 --> 00:00:29.496
show the variable fonts.
&gt;&gt; Jason: Let

8
00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:33.467
me see if I have that,
&gt;&gt; Jason: There we

9
00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:38.353
go.
&gt;&gt; Jason: And

10
00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:42.580
this is because this demo is meant for
monotype to show everybody.

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.135
There's still plenty of people that might
have a browser that doesn't support it.

12
00:00:45.135 --> 00:00:49.390
They still get the essay,
they can still read it.

13
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.720
The typography is still, it's okay,

14
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.320
it's not as,
maybe as refined as I'd like it to be.

15
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.600
But, they can still get the point and they
can still take something away from this.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.560
And they get that message
that let's them know

17
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.320
this is why you're seeing it this way.

18
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.490
So that's set up.

19
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.160
And these components so

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.320
here's what it looks like add supports
forge variation settings normal.

21
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.330
Meaning, if that's true
execute the CSS in between.

22
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.480
So in this case, I'm using
the make sure nobody sees it ever

23
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.030
CSS that Sets of display, the visibility,
everything to get it out of the way so

24
00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.940
it's totally removed
from the document flow.

25
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.600
Using not,
meaning it negates the condition.

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.580
So if it does not support font
variation settings, I remove

27
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.830
my example ampersand animation, and then I
add in, I display my note support message.

28
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.020
So, that way I can kind of
tie these things together.

29
00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.740
And if the test fails,
they're gonna get the message

30
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.279
because I'm not hiding it based on font
variation settings being supported.

31
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.920
So this is another one of those
examples of trying to decide where you

32
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.120
need to determine the level of support,
and what happens when things fail.

33
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.780
So at supports is pretty well supported
but it's not universally supported, and

34
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.560
if it's not supported it's certainly
not gonna support variable fonts.

35
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.520
So, where is that condition of failure?

36
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.900
I wanted to make sure that if all of this
stuff falls apart, there still gonna get

37
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.620
some text on the screen and they're gonna
get the message that tells them, why?

38
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.190
Why is this not working?

39
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.320
So, now, it's kind of interesting
example to one place I haven't

40
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.450
been able to deal with this effectively
yet is in Safari 9 in earlier.

41
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.360
Loading the variable font will crash
the browsers straight out, and

42
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.780
I haven't quite figured out
how to trap for that yet.

43
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.542
If handled most of the other scenarios
that are likely to come up to make sure

44
00:03:02.542 --> 00:03:07.695
that this sample page functions to get
the content across, and then hopefully,

45
00:03:07.695 --> 00:03:12.053
if the browser supports it with
the design that we'll make it sing.

46
00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:18.172
&gt;&gt; Jason: Let's see if I have,

47
00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:20.978
up at the top here.

48
00:03:20.978 --> 00:03:22.068
There we go.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have a question.

49
00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:23.435
&gt;&gt; Jason: Yeah, go ahead.

50
00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:26.129
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you have at supports, and

51
00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.283
your condition is, if that doesn't load,

52
00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:35.450
if you have the supports one
within that conditional,

53
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.320
why do you have to also put it in
the condition that it did load?

54
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.283
What does that do for you?
&gt;&gt; Jason: There were two things that I

55
00:03:44.283 --> 00:03:45.906
wanted to change.

56
00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:51.284
If it was supported, I wanted to make sure

57
00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:57.580
the warning message is
nowhere to be found.

58
00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.960
If it's not supported I want
to make the example go away.

59
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.807
So, I really wanted to make sure I was
dealing with those conditions separately,

60
00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:12.636
so that I can not sort of the minimum
amount of code rewriting to say,

61
00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:14.524
if the condition is true.

62
00:04:14.524 --> 00:04:19.364
Cuz I'm doing the same thing up here,
where I'm only loading Fira,

63
00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:22.540
Sans if they don't support variable fonts.

64
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.080
And so if that test fails,
okay, load this, and

65
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.650
that's the CSS that I'm gonna use.

66
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:36.287
And then down below, right down here,
&gt;&gt; Jason: I

67
00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:39.150
apologize if this is
giving anybody vertigo.

68
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.596
So it's two different elements
that I want it to act on, and

69
00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:47.562
I want it to do different things to them.

70
00:04:47.562 --> 00:04:52.628
And that's why I didn't, I only wanted to

71
00:04:52.628 --> 00:04:57.836
move the support message
if this was true and

72
00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:01.800
it does support variable fonts.

73
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.670
I wanted that one specifically,
because otherwise,

74
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.000
if everything fails including
the check for at support.

75
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.630
Then, I want them to see
that no support message.

76
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.920
That's why I wanted to have
that one there explicitly.

77
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.430
And then, if it succeeds in checking for

78
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.210
variable fonts not working,
then I wanna move the ampersand

79
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.471
animation out of the way.

80
00:05:34.471 --> 00:05:34.976
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jason: So-

81
00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:37.013
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But why do you have to have

82
00:05:37.013 --> 00:05:39.635
the no support message within,

83
00:05:39.635 --> 00:05:43.240
if it's worked?
&gt;&gt; Jason: Well,

84
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.388
that's where I'm turning it off.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,

85
00:05:45.388 --> 00:05:47.946
[CROSSTALK] defult is.
&gt;&gt; Jason: Right,

86
00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.040
the default is that it'll show up.

87
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.106
So, like in Firefox it just, it moves
the ampersand stuff out of the way and

88
00:05:56.106 --> 00:06:00.167
it leaves the support
message where it should be.

89
00:06:01.302 --> 00:06:03.573
&gt;&gt; Jason: I'm a little mixed, but

90
00:06:03.573 --> 00:06:08.115
the reason I wanted to
separate those things was so

91
00:06:08.115 --> 00:06:13.644
I could think about them, and
deal with them consistently.

92
00:06:13.644 --> 00:06:17.239
So if it doesn't load, doesn't support it,

93
00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:21.680
load the non variable font,
and do this thing over here.

94
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.770
My normal condition is if
there is a warning message,

95
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.820
if it does support the variable
fonts now remove that.

96
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:34.859
So it's really more of a mental thing for
me, but it's also what is the default?

97
00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:39.970
And the default I want it to be
the warning message is present.

98
00:06:47.277 --> 00:06:50.124
&gt;&gt; Jason: So with this combination,

99
00:06:50.124 --> 00:06:55.443
now I went serve the inverse way and
I said up top that

100
00:06:55.443 --> 00:07:00.515
I only wana to load Fira Sans
if it does not support

101
00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:06.500
variable fonts because this
is a variable font demo.

102
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.350
That was the whole point.

103
00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:15.110
I think that were you to think about
putting variable fonts into production

104
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.720
today.

105
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:21.920
I would go the opposite routes and
say, if supports is true

106
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.969
now load the variable fund, and then
scope all your font family assignments

107
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.610
in the similar manner at supports
font variation settings, normal.

108
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.560
Then replace your font family
declarations with the variable font, and

109
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.600
add in all the CSS that you want to
govern that type of graphic system.

110
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.290
So that was as soon as that test starts
passing everywhere it just works.

111
00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.740
And eventually,
then you can rip out the other stuff.

112
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:57.590
But it's pretty safe for you to start
to put that in production today.

113
00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.576
Because if you have it scoped that way,

114
00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:05.462
it's only gonna pass in a browser
where it supports variables,

115
00:08:05.462 --> 00:08:10.815
calculations at supports,
future detection, and variable fonts.

116
00:08:10.815 --> 00:08:13.605
You can kinda get them all of those
things together if the variable font

117
00:08:13.605 --> 00:08:14.180
test is true.
