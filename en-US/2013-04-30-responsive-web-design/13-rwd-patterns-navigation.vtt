2
00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:09.860
&gt;&gt; Ben: Let's take a look at some emerging
patterns that we're seeing in responsive.

3
00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.700
There's lots of challenges, okay.

4
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.250
There's, we're only a couple
of years into this entire,

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.920
this sort of this technique that is really
revolutionizing the way we build sites.

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.130
So what I'd like to do, is take a look
at some areas where I feel like there

7
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.470
are some real challenges left for us to
figure out complex navigation tables.

8
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.150
How do we handle big tables of data?

9
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.180
So let's take a look at some of
these more complex challenges.

10
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.350
What I'm going to do is just kind of
walk you through a bunch of examples of

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.060
stuff that I've found online,
that I think is relevant.

12
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.520
And we'll take a look at how some people
are solving some of these things.

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.660
Some of these are great solutions and
some of them are not.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.700
But it's good for us to kind of look at
and identify what works and what doesn't.

15
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.420
So we're gonna start with navigation
recover some ideas of all these different

16
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.801
types of navigations, just can be easy for
me to do this in the browser so.

17
00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:16.678
&gt;&gt; Ben: Okay, so

18
00:01:16.678 --> 00:01:19.455
I've got a handful of
sites across the top here,

19
00:01:19.455 --> 00:01:22.250
these tabs that I'm just
going to walk through.

20
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.480
And we'll just take a look at how
they've handled their navigation.

21
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.690
So this is probably the simplest
way you could do it.

22
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.240
This is pretty common for small sites
that don't have much in terms of nav.

23
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.690
They're just gonna basically keep
the nav exactly the same, but

24
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.890
shift it up to someplace
where it's a bit more usable.

25
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.220
This I mean this works because
the nav is so small right.

26
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.500
So as soon as you add a handful
more this kind of breaks.

27
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.040
The other thing that's I think challenging
with this is they haven't really thought

28
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.490
about the usability of that nav.

29
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.270
It's pretty close to the top of
the browser which means I could

30
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.130
very easily hit part of the Chrome,
of the actual browser itself.

31
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.780
So that's something that
they may want to consider.

32
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.270
But you can see how they've handled
just kind of shifting that nav around.

33
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.040
Contents Magazine is another here and

34
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.530
you can kind of see this nav
across the top right here.

35
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.500
Again, this is a very small navigation but
watch what happens when we get to

36
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.561
a certain resolution here.
&gt;&gt; Ben: All

37
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:27.758
of a sudden our nav kinda disappears and
I get this explorer link,

38
00:02:27.758 --> 00:02:30.260
clicking this takes me to the footer.

39
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.570
Literally just the old school anchor tag,
okay?

40
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.990
And so
what I've seen quite a bit of these days,

41
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.490
which I actually really like this pattern,

42
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.470
is people actually putting their nav
in the footer in terms of source order.

43
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.590
Putting it into the footer.

44
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.480
So a list, another list or
a nav element, whatever,

45
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.740
however you mark that up,
lives literally in the footer of the page.

46
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.440
And then at larger resolutions with CSS,
positioning that

47
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.170
nav up into an area that makes a bit more
sense where a user might expect to see it.

48
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.120
And then at smaller resolutions,

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.830
letting it live in source order
at the bottom of the site,

50
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.940
but giving them just a simple anchor to
kind of drop them down to the footer.

51
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.804
A bunch of sites are doing this kind
of thing now, pretty simple, okay.

52
00:03:12.804 --> 00:03:16.900
And this kind of just
happens at a mid tier and

53
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.010
stays the same even
the lower you get here.

54
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.053
Deconstruct, this is
the 2012 Deconstruct site.

55
00:03:25.053 --> 00:03:29.497
[COUGH] I love the site it's one
of my favorite responsive sites.

56
00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:32.870
But in particular I like how they handled
their navigation that again they have

57
00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.510
a sort of a smaller nav right,
there's only really four items here.

58
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.800
Home, Conference, Workshops and
Locations, location and

59
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.620
as I take this down you'll see watch the
word location kind of says it starts to

60
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.800
get behind this sold out
banner they do this, okay?

61
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.400
Now you guys have seen this you
know the three bars kind of

62
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.760
representing that there's a navigation or
a menu of some kind.

63
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.780
And for what they've done
is they've opted to kind of

64
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.520
enhanced the navigation
at smaller resolutions.

65
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.350
I love this, they've really taken into
consideration the target size, right?

66
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.720
I can really easily hit all three of
those buttons, no problem, dead simple.

67
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.350
And they've actually even made it a bit
more visual, they've added icons.

68
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.980
It's a really, really nice solution.

69
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.410
So, I think this is great.

70
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.160
I love the idea that there's sort of
making the nav even more enjoyable,

71
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.670
I think, at smaller resolutions.

72
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.370
It's kind of shows you where
their priorities are you know.

73
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.890
This is a site using drop
down to do this to do nav.

74
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.170
And I've seen lots of sites using
this again this is one where

75
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.540
sometimes that larger resolutions
they're just a normal nav.

76
00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.430
As you get smaller, they shift all
that nav into, or hide that nav and

77
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.550
show a select standard HTML select box.

78
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.740
One thing to watch out for
with this is that,

79
00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.480
you kind of need JavaScript to
actually trigger something, right.

80
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.360
So if you're gonna use a form like this,
or you can use a submit.

81
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.550
So if you're going to
use a system like this,

82
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.500
it's great to use JavaScript to sort
of capture the change on the select.

83
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.360
And then trigger a page change,
a navigation.

84
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.080
But you should also think about what's
going to happen if somebody happens to

85
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.550
have their JavaScript disabled.

86
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.870
Cuz if you don't, in this scenario,

87
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.490
they're not gonna be able
to navigate your site.

88
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.770
That's a that's a problem, right?

89
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.940
And all you would need to do very simply
is add a little go button of some kind,

90
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.540
you know, which is actually
going to be like a submit.

91
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:41.850
Three lines of PHP on the backend or
whatever you want to use to just take

92
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.130
a look at which one was selected and
load the right page.

93
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.440
Really simple ten minutes to do that
you know it's definitely worth it.

94
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.370
In this case if I disable
JavaScript here you see that's

95
00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:01.113
kind of what happens right so
you get a standard select with a Go.

96
00:06:01.113 --> 00:06:04.924
Twitter has, who's using bootstrap,
Twitter bootstrap?

97
00:06:04.924 --> 00:06:08.438
A couple of guys, okay, cool.

98
00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:10.880
They have this navigation pattern
that's also pretty familiar.

99
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.403
You've seen again the three lines and
they do this reveal, it is what it is.

100
00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:22.355
This is everywhere right now this is
definitely something we're seeing

101
00:06:22.355 --> 00:06:23.380
a lot of.

102
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.860
And then let's talk about
some more complex sites,

103
00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.670
some more complex navigations.

104
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.200
So this is a college site and you can
kind of see if I click here I reveal

105
00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.010
kind of a mega menu,
I can click through each of these, right.

106
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.280
And I can get those,
now if I take the resolution down,

107
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.510
you can see I've gotten sort of these
three kind of navigation areas.

108
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.260
So I've got a Main Menu which reveals and
I was in Admissions before so

109
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:56.190
I'm you know I can kind of shift
through and I can get to multiple tiers

110
00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.140
of navigation in a more complex and
more complex in a larger site.

111
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.390
There's also this idea of colleges
need to have millions of links for

112
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.200
everything all right.

113
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.810
But what I think is really cool about
this in particular is the amount of

114
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.460
space that's being taken up,
like this is minimal, right?

115
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:22.180
To try and get all this navigation and
even the site's identity, which

116
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.720
actually shifts at higher resolutions
to this you know more sort of square.

117
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.210
They're being really concerned with
trying to make sure that they're not that

118
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:38.260
the user can still see content as opposed
to just navigation when they hit the page.

119
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.010
If you go out to that
media crease site and

120
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.610
browse through a handful of those,
you're going to see that

121
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.310
most sites still are giving
people just a big list of links.

122
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.025
That's the first thing you see.

123
00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:51.116
And in fact,
that's what you see on every page,

124
00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:54.370
there's no indication that
you're on something different.

125
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.883
Really, really incredibly confusing for
a user.

126
00:07:56.883 --> 00:08:00.990
In fact, this is one of the reasons
that we are rethinking our site.

127
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.240
You know Spark Box's site,
we're probably the worst culprit here.

128
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:12.570
If I go out to our website, and
I go to our foundry, watch what happens.

129
00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:18.250
Let's just drill into an article here,
okay, great.

130
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.060
Here's what somebody on
a smartphone is gonna see

131
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.360
when they come to this page right.

132
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.250
Kind of looks like a 404, [LAUGH].

133
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.341
Hey we couldn't find what you're looking
for here's the footer it's not really

134
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:34.906
the footer, but it kind of looks that way,
search for something else.

135
00:08:34.906 --> 00:08:40.388
And I have to do one, two,
three scrolls, three pages of stuff,

136
00:08:40.388 --> 00:08:45.427
I have to go through to get
to the actual content, right?

137
00:08:45.427 --> 00:08:49.080
Yeah [LAUGH] Sorry, I just noticed this,
this just went up today.

138
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.240
We're redesigning our site and
you can follow along if you want.

139
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:57.110
So, [LAUGH] Anyway, that's interesting,
didn't realize that was going live today.

140
00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:01.420
But you can see like even at large
resolutions this is terrible, right,

141
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.310
the UX on this is awful [LAUGH].

142
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:07.240
What happened for me is we got so
caught up in some of the cool techniques

143
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.250
that we forgot to really
think about the user.

144
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.120
So we're redesigning we're
rethinking all this stuff.

145
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:18.141
And in contrast to that with
the way that the Mount St.

146
00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:22.037
Joseph site really compresses
all that information,

147
00:09:22.037 --> 00:09:26.250
the user might need up into
a very minimal vertical space.

148
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.430
[COUGH] We recently retrofitted
the Dayton Power and

149
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.120
Light company which is our local utility.

150
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:37.390
And they had a sort of an existing
design that we'd worked with them on.

151
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:41.180
This is the organization I was telling
you about that we shifted to clicks for

152
00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:44.200
their primary nav, you know?

153
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.900
So, again this is a fairly
complex navigation,

154
00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:50.820
in fact what you're getting
here is three levels of nav.

155
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:54.650
I've got Customer Service,
Outage Center, Outage Map,

156
00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.960
three levels that I've got to be
able to show at a small resolution.

157
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.160
And we were tasked with doing
this without changing the markup.

158
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.420
So we had to basically use
the existing markup for their nav and

159
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.760
make that work at small resolutions.

160
00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:10.000
And when you take this down,
similar approach but

161
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.840
you kinda get this, you can kinda do these
sorts of things and you can drill in and

162
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.280
see all three, all three levels.

163
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.866
So this is actually really usable,
I've done some usability testing with it.

164
00:10:20.866 --> 00:10:25.650
It kinda ], when you reveal that nav
it gives you what is very familiar to

165
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:29.050
mobile users, the sort of a list of I
can choose to kind of navigate through.

166
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.700
And then of course if you guys
haven't seen the Boston Globe yet

167
00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.872
you need to go take a look at.

168
00:10:36.872 --> 00:10:41.821
Ethan himself actually worked on that
along with the guys at Filament group

169
00:10:41.821 --> 00:10:45.340
just really beautifully executed site.

170
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.440
And you can see how they've adjusted, and

171
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.900
really nice demonstration of
the flexible system underlying all this.

172
00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:58.600
You can see these columns slowly adjusting
their width as you take it down.

173
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:03.170
And watch this nav, I mean they've got
a fairly complex navigation here, right?

174
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.460
All the different sections of the paper
have their own big mega dropdown.

175
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.256
And the more we kind of drill down
&gt;&gt; Ben: you'll

176
00:11:12.256 --> 00:11:15.990
see that eventually they shift
into this sections, okay?

177
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.889
So again, those are all the links
that were sort of across the top.

178
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.350
If I take this down even further,

179
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.790
it goes to sort of a single
column of those sections.

180
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.550
So incredibly usable,
really nice tight based design.

181
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:34.710
But they're really thinking about the
usability of, from a user's perspective.

182
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.760
How do I shift into a mentality
that enables them to touch through

183
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.260
my nav, okay.
