00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.568
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:08.500
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I kinda just use this
as an experiment, a place to play.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.910
Okay and so you can see,
I mean it's really it's dead simple but,

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.120
hey there you guys are, cool.

5
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.820
So if I open this up.

6
00:00:27.844 --> 00:00:30.540
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Here let's
take a look at the index.

7
00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:36.640
Again, this is a place for
me to experiment, so

8
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.840
there's all kinds of stuff in here, but
what's important here is the top, okay?

9
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.070
Is that big enough, you guys see it okay?

10
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.750
Yes, so this style sheet again, so

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.910
we're looking to base with no media
feature, no media type, no media query.

12
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.920
And then we've got a second link.

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.800
And I showed you before
that it was just not print.

14
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.288
I've just written a kind of a,
done a bunch of research and

15
00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:05.635
written a little article with
a buddy of mine actually,

16
00:01:05.635 --> 00:01:10.493
Matt from Bearded, who we talked about
earlier, on why I'm doing it like this.

17
00:01:10.493 --> 00:01:14.729
But to be honest with you, I think we've
actually, and Jason Grimsby has said,

18
00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.778
has talked about this is well when he's
done a bunch of research on the TV media

19
00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:23.400
type we've actually kind of ruined,
TV media type has no meaning anymore.

20
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.290
There was a question earlier about,

21
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.400
could a user agent report true to
multiple of those media types.

22
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.870
And the answer, according to spec, is no.

23
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.730
What that means is, if you go look at
how people are writing these styles,

24
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:43.490
like if we go over to,
let's just go to the Media Queries site.

25
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.167
You guys know about this resource huge
gallery of sites that use Media Queries.

26
00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:55.000
Okay, mediaqueri.es Media Queries, okay.

27
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.840
It's in the it's in that repository too.

28
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.549
But if I just open up a handful of
these sites I'm just going to pick.

29
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.667
The first four, okay?
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: If we start

30
00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:08.180
to look at these and
I just run that bookmarklet,

31
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.880
that mediaQueryBookmarklet,
see what they're doing?

32
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.680
Only screen and min width, okay?

33
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.707
That's the first one.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Only screen

34
00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:29.487
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Screen end okay,

35
00:02:29.487 --> 00:02:32.480
what they're doing all of these sites.

36
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.210
Most of the sites that
are responsive today

37
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.870
are scoping all of their
styles to screen and.

38
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.050
So imagine now that I'm making
a smart TV and I decide that I want to

39
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.170
have a nice browser that actually
renders websites very beautifully.

40
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.750
If I don't say true to screen I'm not
going to get any of these styles.

41
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.030
And there is a TV media type.

42
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.890
You know the people who wrote the spec
really thinking about the future and

43
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.460
so zero of the TV's that are being
produced right now smart TV's

44
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.720
response true to the TV media type.

45
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.810
So essentially because we've seen so
tightly scoped these styles.

46
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.720
We've really kind of ruined the usefulness
of that media type there's no way to

47
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.837
really indicate or
change your style based on a TV.

48
00:03:16.837 --> 00:03:23.760
So this is a real problem and I feel like
we need to start thinking about ways,

49
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.920
you know ways that we can try to avoid
that as much as we can in the future.

50
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.660
That's kind of a tall order,

51
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.760
I don't know that what we're
that we can actually rescue.

52
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.780
There's no way we can rescue the TV
media type, that's not gonna happen.

53
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.960
But I'm trying to start
thinking a bit about.

54
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.000
I should have left that that over.

55
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.680
I'm trying to start thinking about how do
we how do we do this sort of responsibly.

56
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.800
So what I've done here is I've said
not print but also not Braille

57
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.710
embossed beach TDY I don't want my complex
layout to apply to any of those really.

58
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.970
And this lets me nest a query.

59
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.370
You can't really do this not print.

60
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.970
I did all kinds of tests to try to figure
out can I do this in a single file.

61
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.910
A single media query and
there's really no way to do it.

62
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.160
That not negates the entire query.

63
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.230
Okay, and that's according to spec.

64
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.490
And so you can kind of see
I've used the same technique.

65
00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.159
Let's look at the actual partials too so
you guys can see those.

66
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.590
So here's the structure.

67
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.430
Okay, I have this.

68
00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:33.400
So I have this.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I have this scss folder.

69
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.820
Okay, here's a base scss, mq, nomq.

70
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.570
Smallest with an underscore prefix
just means I can include it.

71
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.360
It's kind of just a you know a way that
you can indicate this is a partial

72
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.760
same thing with the rest of these I'm
using normalize I've got some mix ins

73
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.090
I'm doing some other things but you can
see these are the kind of the key right?

74
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.680
Smallest min width thirty
six min width ninety, okay.

75
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.734
So if we take a look at those
files themselves inside

76
00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:04.481
smallest.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I'm doing

77
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:09.100
some styles that apply to just to
create that simple list layout.

78
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.460
As we go to min-width 36 you'll
see these get kinda smaller and

79
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.050
smaller the higher we go generally.

80
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.950
And then at 90 Ms I've got almost
no styles it's just a couple little

81
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.130
tweaks that I need to make to
the layout at that resolution.

82
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.140
So, this gives us a way to really
support older browsers that

83
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.920
don't have media creation.

84
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.430
We do this structure on most
of our sites these days

85
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.770
there's lots of other ways
to kind of approach this.

86
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.080
Some people ignore those old browsers.

87
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.440
They say if you don't have a browser the
sports media queries you're going to get

88
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.950
the smallest layout.

89
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.135
But our customers aren't generally
happy with that approach so

90
00:05:45.135 --> 00:05:51.740
[LAUGH] depending on your client
that could be an approach you take.

91
00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.180
There's other ways Jeremy Keith has
written on his site about ways that you

92
00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.000
can do this with just CSS by breaking your
styles up in a much more different way.

93
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.020
Yeah there's a handful of other ways and

94
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.010
then when we get into the JavaScript
section I'll show you some ways that you

95
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.470
can support those older browsers
with media query poly fills.

96
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.730
Any questions on on this?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's your feeling on

97
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.530
respond
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: We're going to get into

98
00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.630
that when we jump in
the Java Script section.

99
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.460
We have used it and we'll we'll jump into
that when we get into JavaScript Yeah.

100
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.780
Good question though.

101
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.220
That's one of the poly fills to get older
browsers to support a subset of media

102
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.320
query functionality.

103
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.840
Anything else there?

104
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.670
Who's built a site already
a responsive site for a client.

105
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:41.420
Who's built one.

106
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.880
Okay, how are you guys
linking your styles?

107
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.330
Are you doing large resolution first, and

108
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.700
then sort of undoing styles as you go?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I do large

109
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.100
first.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.

110
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:51.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Large first.

111
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.270
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: How about you?

112
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I started

113
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.490
my first responsive site was large first.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.

114
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.706
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And it became grossly

115
00:07:00.706 --> 00:07:02.698
unmaintainable.

116
00:07:02.698 --> 00:07:06.455
And it was, I'll never use a max-width

117
00:07:06.455 --> 00:07:11.180
media query again.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Don't say never.

118
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:14.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You know, as much as

119
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:19.510
possible, I'm going to avoid
the max-width media query and

120
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:25.500
try to go to sites that I do that cuz I
try to take as much of a purist approach

121
00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.060
with min width and start with min first.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So then,

122
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.740
are you using respond to serve the larger
layouts to older user agents, okay.

123
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:37.158
You're a JavaScript guy so.

124
00:07:37.158 --> 00:07:41.290
[LAUGH] Anybody else?

125
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.120
Okay, all right, cool.

126
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.750
[COUGH] The examples that
are in the repository

127
00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.750
when I've done this kind
of a workshop in the past.

128
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:55.840
I've been hesitant to make people
install SaaS, pre-compilers and

129
00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.000
those kinds of things.

130
00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.610
So I've replicated this
same kind of stuff.

131
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:05.420
But I've done it just using Media Queries
in the links in the link in the head.

132
00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.340
Let's take a look at one of those because
I don't want you guys to go look at these

133
00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:15.918
examples, and then

134
00:08:15.918 --> 00:08:21.690
use this in production because this
isn't really intended it's only intended

135
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.770
to kind of demonstrate a technique so
you can see what I'm doing here.

136
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.940
It's the same kind of thing, but this
we're using SAS to take all this stuff and

137
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.140
build a single file.

138
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.190
So we can make a single request,
all right.

139
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.450
As opposed to linking you wouldn't
really wanna do this link to multiple

140
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.360
style sheets like this in your head.

141
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.060
Cuz this is gonna create a dozen
requests to your server,

142
00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:48.150
which is gonna be terrible for
your performance.

143
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.410
But you can see the same
kind of thing is happening.

144
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:53.460
So I have this 450 pixel 450 CSS and

145
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.680
down here, I'm linking to it in
old IE without that media query.

146
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:05.330
Okay, same concept without SASS, but
it creates much too many requests.

147
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.860
Okay, so we use SASS.

148
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.170
The basic usage is just to
kind of get the requests down.

149
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.640
You could do this in other ways, too.

150
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.300
Questions on this before we jump in?
