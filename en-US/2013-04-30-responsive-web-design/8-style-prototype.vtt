00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.733
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:10.300
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Okay, so let's talk
a little bit about style deliverables.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.910
We've been doing creating something now
for a few months called a style prototype.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.770
Which actually has, probably even more so

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.980
than that the content priority prototype
has change the way we work, too.

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.530
Anybody familiar with style tiles?

7
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.766
Samantha Warren's sort of moodboard for

8
00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:32.190
the web is I think is
kind of how she calls it.

9
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.950
Anyway, style tiles
are the same concept but

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.590
it's done in Photoshop and presented to
the user as a picture, a static image.

11
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.170
So what we've been doing is,
we've been actually,

12
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.445
we've got sort of a single common markup,
common document.

13
00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:49.960
No real content in it.

14
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.480
It's literally just some simple,
very simple items and

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.700
it's the combination that we can use for
anybody's style prototype.

16
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.470
We run this part of our process in tandem
with prioritization deliverables, okay?

17
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.880
We're kind of split into two roads and

18
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.540
were running a couple of things at once,
making progress here.

19
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.620
Incredibly fast to build these things.

20
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.103
We're not designing a comp, okay?

21
00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:17.159
All we're doing is getting some concepts
down in the browser, some concepts

22
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.170
down that would indicate colors and
textures, maybe some styles for links.

23
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.460
You can show real web typography.

24
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.660
And again, this is the deliverable
that they get a link to, okay?

25
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.030
Okay, they're gonna open it
in whatever browser they use.

26
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.350
So if they're using old IE and
you wanna have rounded corners and

27
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.010
you wanna use CSS to round those corners.

28
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.490
That customer is gonna open
it up in their browser and

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.990
they're gonna see it without
those rounded corners.

30
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.010
And now you don't have to have
a conversation with them about

31
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.210
the picture of rounded corners
that you showed them before.

32
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.620
And why it doesn't work in their browser.

33
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.140
They're seeing it, their expectations
are already established.

34
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.440
So there's some real benefits to this.

35
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.490
Incredibly easy to show web interaction.

36
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.370
I mean how many times are you trying
to do that crap in Photoshop, and

37
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.160
like exploiting multiple images to show

38
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.560
what color something changes
at a different state.

39
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770
I mean that's just doesn't, that's a pain.

40
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.130
You can just do it in the browser.

41
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.960
It's really simple to do those things.

42
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.660
Literally, I can sit with
a client in our conversation

43
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.780
with a style pro prototype on
the projector and get their feedback.

44
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.260
And in real time,
just make some changes to it.

45
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.440
I mean it's happened so fast and
we get through a lot of the challenging

46
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.560
conversations about their preferences for
style early in the process.

47
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.790
And then we'll get into more
detailed comps in designing in and

48
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.880
we'll talk a lot about how we do that,
but the thing is we don't miss later.

49
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.200
We get it right because we've already had
some of those interesting conversations

50
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.160
about what their preferences are.

51
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.280
These things we can build
in less than a day.

52
00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.580
I mean it's so simple and
we may do one or two of these.

53
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.420
We may make some modifications to one.

54
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.390
But literally in a couple days time,
we can have a really solid direction

55
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.870
on where we're headed with the with
the visual side of the site.

56
00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.330
So let's take a look at a couple these.

57
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.890
Actually, I wanna show you, so
we are gonna show you a couple of ours.

58
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.170
One for our old site the see
sparkbox.com that's out there now and

59
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.260
one for the Dress Responsibly.

60
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.670
Yeah, for another one of our ideas.

61
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.426
And then I'm gonna show you what has
started cropping up all over the web and

62
00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:31.199
a handful of other people who are doing
something kind of like this, okay?

63
00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.820
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So this is an example
of a style prototype, okay?

64
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.880
This is this was built for
our site, sparkbox.com.

65
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.910
You can kinda see we're indicating some
of these big bold kinds of headlines,

66
00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:00.450
full width kind of bleeding
black color bars or black bars.

67
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.450
You can see it's responsive in nature,
but it's just very simply responsive.

68
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.050
We're not doing anything crazy here.

69
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.670
What we're starting to imply to our
users or our clients, that they can.

70
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.160
Actually, like if CEO, or whatever,
gets the thing on his Blackberry,

71
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.990
he can open this up and
look at it on his phone.

72
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:18.480
He can look at it.

73
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.010
And it's really nice because we can
start those conversations about

74
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.650
trying to build stuff that works
regardless of the view port with.

75
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.150
We've we're showing some iconography,

76
00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.120
some hover states,
some of the illustrations style.

77
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.240
Our side is a little bit quirky and so

78
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.580
this kind of indicated some of
those things, really simple right.

79
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.220
You can imagine that this doesn't take
long to build especially after you've

80
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.510
built a dozen of them.

81
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.600
You're really just going in and
kind of changing some colors.

82
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.390
You've already got some of
the responsiveness in there.

83
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.350
It's very simple to do.

84
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.560
Here's another one for
the Dress Responsively project, okay?

85
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.470
Same kind of thing.

86
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.600
Again, indicating some of
the responsiveness here and

87
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.990
starting to see a little tags that hang,
some typography.

88
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.450
This is web type.

89
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.240
So we can show them what this type is
gonna look like in their browser, right?

90
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.230
Pretty simple.

91
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.270
Now Steve Fisher is a buddy of mine.

92
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.550
He works at Yellow Pencil and
I saw him tweet this a few months back.

93
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.080
This is sort of maybe combination of

94
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.750
the two things that we just
that we just talked about.

95
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.620
This is one of his deliverables.

96
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.080
It's sort of a priority.

97
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.120
I don't think he's
implying style with this,

98
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.900
but you can see he's doing
the same kinds of things.

99
00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.000
This is more of like an interactive
wireframe is kind of what this is, right?

100
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.830
You'll also notice that
he's got these little guys.

101
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.820
So he's kind of worked in.

102
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.630
What he's found I think probably from his
previous version of this was probably done

103
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.820
statically and like Illustrator or
Keynote or some wireframing too.

104
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.560
And they probably had a section where
you could kinda indicate something and

105
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.580
provide some notes about those elements,
right?

106
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.230
So he's built that in with
a sort of a modal system here.

107
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.870
Pretty simple, main navigation,
a simple one level bubble block, okay?

108
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.351
Pretty cool.

109
00:06:07.351 --> 00:06:11.980
Again, what this is doing is
trying to get into the browser,

110
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.620
using the actual medium that
we're gonna be delivering in.

111
00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.150
So this isn't throwaway stuff.

112
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.600
And you use something like
Bootstrap if you want.

113
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.520
Just some framework to just to kind
of quickly get things laid out.

114
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.430
Here's Brad Frost's version.

115
00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:27.670
Same kind of thing.

116
00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.270
Brad's a great guy.

117
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.056
This feels a bit too designed to me.

118
00:06:34.056 --> 00:06:38.970
I feel like, again,
this is sort of that mentality of we

119
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.535
feel like we need to keep getting closer
and closer to that final deliverable.

120
00:06:42.535 --> 00:06:45.975
And really what we should be doing is
identifying the earlier the process

121
00:06:45.975 --> 00:06:51.565
the design preferences and
style preferences and then also priority.

122
00:06:51.565 --> 00:06:55.115
But he's got this idea of
annotation they're turned off here.

123
00:06:55.115 --> 00:06:58.890
And if I turn them on, I start to get
this little it's hard to see probably for

124
00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.270
you guys but
that little question mark icon.

125
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.000
And I can click things and

126
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.950
it pops up a little annotation
about the element that I clicked.

127
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:12.310
So same kind of idea trying to
sort of help a user understand

128
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.300
some of the things that are important
these resolutions in terms of priority.

129
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.580
Again, it's responsive, works pretty well.

130
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.410
He's demonstrating how the nab might work.

131
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:25.910
Really cool.

132
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.232
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: And
then Dan Mall just, he and

133
00:07:30.232 --> 00:07:35.600
his team are doing a public redesign
right now of an organization.

134
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.160
That's intended to help with reading.

135
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.020
And so this is something he
just put out the other day.

136
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.030
This is sort of their design round two,
okay?

137
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.990
You can see the URL up there.

138
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.360
All these will be in the slides, too,
these links, so you can play with them.

139
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.740
But he's kind of taken
time to really design out

140
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:55.130
a deliverable here that's
being viewed in the browser.

141
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.310
But a lot of this stuff
is just sort of static.

142
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.540
But you can see, it's he's trying
to indicate how type might look.

143
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.468
A couple different options for typefaces.

144
00:08:07.468 --> 00:08:13.470
I mean, it's very nice design,
a nice concept.

145
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:18.620
Again, this feels like this could
take a lot of time to build this.

146
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.400
And in this context, it's really sort
of static, it's pictures of a website.

147
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:28.570
So it's interesting.

148
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:33.350
The further down you go even
starts to show some websites

149
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:38.080
literally in this is more like a moodboard
on the web it's kind of what this is.

150
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.020
So anyway some pretty cool.

151
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.714
Pretty cool deliverables
that are starting to pop up.

152
00:08:44.614 --> 00:08:47.354
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Questions
about any of those concepts?

153
00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:54.860
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So
I'll pop through these quickly.

154
00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:59.590
So a couple articles for you guys on this.

155
00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:04.210
My Creative Director Jeremy Lloyd
wrote this a month or two back.

156
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.760
Called Our New Responsive Web Design
Deliverable The Style Prototype.

157
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.320
This goes into much,
much greater detail on this,

158
00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.670
on the subject of style prototype,
our specific implementation.

159
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.670
It's out on our blog The Foundry.

160
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:20.740
And then, my buddy Matt Griffin at Bearded
in Pittsburgh wrote this recently on

161
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:26.180
a list a part called Responsive Comping
Obtaining Signoff without Mockups.

162
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.720
This is a really good article.

163
00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.270
I mean go read this if
you haven't read it yet.

164
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:36.280
He goes into really great detail
on the process they use to

165
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:40.940
avoid doing all of their
design straight in Photoshop.

166
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.860
And what he says and

167
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.830
what we've kind of started to see as well
is that we're not ditching Photoshop.

168
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:52.370
I mean we still use Photoshop or
whatever design tool your preference is.

169
00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.960
But we're just finding that

170
00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.560
it's necessary to use Photoshop
almost more as a scratchpad for

171
00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.000
getting some of these textures and
getting some of these elements created.

172
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.730
And then pulling those in as quickly as
we can into the browser into the actual

173
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:07.060
medium that we're going
to be delivering in.

174
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:13.520
The big takeaway here is you cannot
throw the stuff over the wall

175
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.950
anymore, all right?

176
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:18.930
We literally have I mean
collaboration is key for us.

177
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:21.758
We, like I said,
we have content people writing markup.

178
00:10:21.758 --> 00:10:25.000
They are sitting with content
management backend devs and

179
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.585
trying to figure out what a good
architecture for that would be.

180
00:10:28.585 --> 00:10:30.755
We take the idea of sort
of pair programming.

181
00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.912
But we apply it across our organization,

182
00:10:32.912 --> 00:10:36.570
so that we have designers in
front end sitting together.

183
00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.850
UX people in front-end dev sitting
together and really trying to solve these

184
00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:44.030
problems and thinking from a planning
perspective throughout the process.

185
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:45.940
Those are the kind of things
that I think are necessary for

186
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.329
us to build good experiences
across resolutions.

187
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:50.995
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I have a quick question.

188
00:10:50.995 --> 00:10:51.755
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah, what's up?

189
00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:54.795
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you're showing this stuff
in the browser to the client this early,

190
00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:58.070
are you running into a situation with
the client where they expecting you to be

191
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.500
further along than you actually are and
much closer to a final deliverable?

192
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.480
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah,
that's a good question.

193
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.070
He asked, if we're finding that
because we're showing these things

194
00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:10.309
in the browser early in the process,
they're expecting us to be further along.

195
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.540
It's funny because this all has to come
with some sort of client education.

196
00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:22.430
And so what happens a lot of times
if we're answering a request for

197
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.460
a proposal or something is they dictate
out the process they expect to be used.

198
00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:30.930
They're reading great literature that
was written maybe two years ago.

199
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.110
But it was before responsive
came on the scene.

200
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.320
And so the things that they're
saying a really good things.

201
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:42.640
But we try and meet, before I even spend
time writing an estimate for somebody,

202
00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.120
I have a conversation
with them where I say,

203
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:47.240
listen, our process is
a little bit different.

204
00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.230
And in the end,
it generates really good results, but

205
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.520
you're gonna have to
trust me through this.

206
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.690
Is that something that you're open to?

207
00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.670
And so, those are the kind
of conversations I have.

208
00:11:55.670 --> 00:12:00.550
And to be honest, you notice I didn't put
a big process diagram up here, right?

209
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.970
Because every project is different.

210
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:10.240
I could throw some really general buckets
up here, but that's not how it works.

211
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.070
Our medium is too flexible, too dynamic.

212
00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.380
The needs of our customers are so
different.

213
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.250
And so

214
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:21.140
we just take the appropriate deliverables
from our part of the pile of options.

215
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.080
And we think we say okay this is
gonna be what would really help

216
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.800
them to understand what's next for
their site.

217
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.760
And we try to pick and choose those so

218
00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.870
that we kind of in the end
have a really good experience.

219
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.830
And I'm also constantly talking
to our clients about users

220
00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.000
always saying to them if
they push back on something.

221
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.590
I'll say you know what,
I appreciate that you like that color or

222
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:46.090
whatever or you want your logo
to be bigger or whatever.

223
00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:49.380
But let's talk about
the usability of this thing.

224
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.310
Cuz to be honest with you, I don't really
care that your favorite color is green.

225
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.160
What I wanna know is what's gonna work for
your clients?

226
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.670
And that's, I mean that's that simple.

227
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:02.330
A client,
a smart customer of mine gets that.

228
00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.960
And so that simple conversation
happens once or twice, and

229
00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.180
then they start to get it.

230
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:11.970
But you definitely have to find
sort of forward thinking folks.

231
00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.240
So especially if they've
been around the block.

232
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.170
They've built a few sites all ready and
they're very used to the process, yeah.

233
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:21.359
So other questions on process?

234
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.050
Okay, I didn't wanna spend
too much time here, but

235
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.290
I do think it's really relevant for
us to cover some of these things.

236
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:33.940
And then the final point the smaller
you get in terms of the viewport or

237
00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:36.170
the resolution of the of
the browsing device.

238
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.750
The more important priority becomes and

239
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.930
the fewer ways you have to
communicate priority, right?

240
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:47.710
I don't have the ability to sort of set
things out in a nice wide area, but

241
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.570
make one in the top right really bold and
important and different colors.

242
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:54.810
I don't have that ability if I'm
severely limited on the viewport.

243
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.680
So you have to start to think about
ways to reserve screen real estate,

244
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.050
you know, vertically.

245
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:04.080
That's one the biggest challenges I see.

246
00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.490
We'll take a look at some of
those issues a little later on.

247
00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.730
Content priority prototype, style
prototype, these are just a couple ways

248
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:15.360
that you can start to to get your
customers into the browser quicker.

249
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.100
Get your work into the browser sooner.

250
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.970
And I think that they they've actually
dramatically changed the way we

251
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:25.820
build sites so any other questions?

252
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.320
Okay.
