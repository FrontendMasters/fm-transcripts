00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.498
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.498 --> 00:00:07.694
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I wanna walk you guys
through a few things that I feel like

3
00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:11.806
[COUGH], some mistakes that I've made,
and a little bit of, I don't know,

4
00:00:11.806 --> 00:00:16.198
a bit of experience that I've had that I
feel like I need to kind of be sharing

5
00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:19.109
with people as I talk about
some of these things.

6
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.320
I get asked all the time,
how do you price this work?

7
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.810
What does a responsive website cost?

8
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.930
And the answer to that is as ambiguous
as what does a website cost, right?

9
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.340
I mean, it depends on how much
time it takes [LAUGH] in my world.

10
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850
And so what I've tried to do is,

11
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.790
we're very diligent about
tracking our effort on projects.

12
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.770
We track every hour that
we spend on a project.

13
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.390
And so what I've been able to do is
kind of look back at those numbers,

14
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.200
compare those to similar projects that
were not responsive projects, and

15
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.660
start to see what kinds of increases
we're seeing or decreases are we seeing.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.340
And these numbers are always changing.

17
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.470
I'm not gonna give you dollar figures,

18
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.200
I'm gonna give you a percentage increases,
okay?

19
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.170
The other thing that's
important about some of this is

20
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.500
you need to make sure that you're
comparing apples to apples.

21
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.980
So your process, you can't take a process
where you don't have content discovery and

22
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.790
you don't do any of those kinds of
planning deliverables like we talked

23
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.720
about, and then do all of those things and
compare them to that dissimilar process.

24
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.410
So you need to make sure that
you're kind of thinking about

25
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.390
what have you added on top of
what your standard process was.

26
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.660
We've seen our first couple
sites as much as double

27
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.930
in terms of the amount of
effort it took for us.

28
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.438
But this was us kind of reaching
blindly in the dark [LAUGH],

29
00:01:42.438 --> 00:01:47.324
not really understanding what was going
on, trying to figure these things out.

30
00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:51.850
And then, quickly thereafter,
we got down to just 50% more.

31
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.595
And we're starting to kind of
settle at around 25% more time is

32
00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:57.509
about what it takes us to do this.

33
00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.206
Now, interestingly enough,
sorry, go ahead.

34
00:02:00.206 --> 00:02:02.821
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just wanna know,
when you say soon after,

35
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.770
how long do you think it takes?

36
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.337
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: After a couple sites,
a couple sites, so two or three sites in,

37
00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:12.490
we saw that 100% drop significantly.

38
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.490
It's like we just figured
a couple things out [LAUGH]

39
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.470
that we didn't have to go back and
rework, and go back and rework as much.

40
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.760
So that was very quick,
the 25% more was sort of a longer period.

41
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.440
I mean, you can imagine what this
chart looks like, it's that long tail.

42
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.640
And I don't know that we'll ever get to
what it was before, but I am seeing now

43
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.739
that the changes, the small changes,
we're making in our process,

44
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.200
things like doing a style prototype first
instead of a full comp in Photoshop.

45
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.240
Things like that are having impact on
the amount of time that it takes us to

46
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.200
do this stuff.

47
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.270
And we're getting closer and closer to the
same amount of time it used to take us.

48
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.690
I don't know if it'll ever be less.

49
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.870
I can't see that happening,
but we're getting it down.

50
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.520
We're starting to figure
some of these things out.

51
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.280
And it's important, too,
to note that content

52
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.550
driven sites where a lot of these patterns
have kind of emerged and we're starting to

53
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.370
see some really good solutions, are a bit
different than working on an app.

54
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.400
More complex interactions that
you have to make work and

55
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.330
rethink components at smaller resolutions.

56
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.815
You could spend lots of time,
lots more time,

57
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:22.319
trying to think through
some of those things.

58
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.078
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Did you find that
your sites end up being simpler?

59
00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:28.308
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Do you mean
because we're doing responsive?

60
00:03:28.308 --> 00:03:29.009
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

61
00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:33.970
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I've found that we
ask a lot of those questions up front.

62
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.210
Some are sort of this mobile first
mentality saying, hey, you're telling me

63
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.830
that you don't think that functionality
is needed at small screens?

64
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.660
Well, why is it needed on larger screens?

65
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.810
We're not afraid to have
those conversations, but,

66
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.640
no, we try not to dumb them down,
if that's what you mean.

67
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.948
We try to still have a site that's very
usable and that meets sort of what

68
00:03:55.948 --> 00:04:01.891
people would expect to see in top tier
web design at high resolutions, as well.

69
00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.069
And just trying to take those things and

70
00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.695
shift the interaction models enough to
work well on touch at smaller resolutions.

71
00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:10.951
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Do you think the maintenance

72
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:15.135
going forward becomes more or
less with a responsive website?

73
00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:21.050
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Well, there's more CSS,
so there's more maintenance costs there.

74
00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.500
Now, is it exponentially more?

75
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.300
I don't think so.

76
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.850
At Sparkbox we try to also offer
training when we do this stuff.

77
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.690
I don't know how you guys have done this,
we've always done this with our websites.

78
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.260
But what we do now is we
offer a level of sort of

79
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.420
responsive training to their dev
team if they're gonna maintain it.

80
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.304
So we'll come in and do a little bit
of consulting, help them prototype it,

81
00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:45.720
build and write some production code.

82
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.110
And then come behind with a little
bit of a training where we can

83
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.770
sit down with their primary designers and
developers and talk through some

84
00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.980
of these process changes and some of
the techniques we used to do this stuff.

85
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.380
Those kinds of things go a long
way in helping maintain.

86
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.800
And a lot of times it's like
teaching them how to use SAS.

87
00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.081
They've never used some of those tools
before, but they do go a long way.

88
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.270
The kinds of things that
are increasing this are things like

89
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.680
project management costs.

90
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.910
It's more PM time to do this.

91
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.420
I feel that I'm constantly sort
of interacting with my client

92
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.820
to make sure they're coming
alongside this different process.

93
00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.000
[COUGH]
There's fewer patterns out there.

94
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.720
We've built websites for a long time,
but we've only been doing this stuff for

95
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.350
a couple years.

96
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.830
There isn't the same volume of solutions,
ready to use solutions,

97
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.890
out there like there are for
other kinds of web design.

98
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.333
It's more code, so
it takes more time coding.

99
00:05:47.333 --> 00:05:50.773
And testing,
we spend a lot of time testing.

100
00:05:50.773 --> 00:05:54.060
I mean, you can imagine [LAUGH].

101
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.746
No longer are we sort of limited
to a handful of desktop browsers.

102
00:05:57.746 --> 00:06:01.190
Now we're trying to build something
that works on all those browsers at any

103
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.770
viewport width, and

104
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.740
on all of these devices that
have multiple browsers on them.

105
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.950
So this just exponentially
increases the testing.

106
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:13.720
We're gonna talk about testing as well.

107
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.090
The other thing to keep in mind
when you're comparing pricing is

108
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:24.470
if I tell you that it's gonna cost, say,
50% more to build a responsive site than

109
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.500
a fixed width site, you've got to
understand is the value you're getting for

110
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.000
that is significantly greater, too.

111
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.380
The real comparison would be
build me a fixed width site and

112
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.424
a mobile specific site and compare that
price to a responsive site, right.

113
00:06:38.424 --> 00:06:42.830
When clients start asking those
kinds of questions, that's a good

114
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.380
conversation to have, say, well, you have
to have a solution for mobile, right.

115
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.300
I mean, we've seen this growth chart,
you've got to do something.

116
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:54.090
You're rebuilding or redesigning now,
you need to be thinking about mobile.

117
00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:55.290
How do you want to approach it?

118
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.770
Mobile specific, responsive?

119
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.630
And when you start to look at those
numbers, the percentages are not higher,

120
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.530
they're lower.

121
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.840
At least that's what we're seeing.

122
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.650
Plus maintenance,
now I'm maintaining a single code line.

123
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.530
So there's some real robust
selling points, I guess,

124
00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.380
is what you might call them.

125
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:14.992
Questions on pricing?

126
00:07:14.992 --> 00:07:19.000
Those of you who said you had built sites,
are you seeing that same kind of range or

127
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.228
are you seeing anything different?

128
00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:26.807
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: My experience
is having each page

129
00:07:26.807 --> 00:07:34.430
as its own responsive kind of solution.

130
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.130
Each page has a different
set of solutions.

131
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:43.440
So the designer delivered a mobile comp,
and

132
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:48.490
a desktop comp, and
there's not the same type of grids.

133
00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.870
So it's kind of like looking,
well, coming up with

134
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:59.670
an intuitive way to make this
responsive and fill in the gaps.

135
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:04.140
And then each page ends up becoming
its own solution where there's

136
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:10.760
different ways that you
have to switch images.

137
00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.640
I found that to be the most taxing, and

138
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:19.700
I'd say as much as double to
triple the amount of work.

139
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.930
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Because each page was coming

140
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:29.650
up with its own solution versus how
do you take the mobile version and

141
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.290
fill in all the gaps, tablet and all these
different sizes of tablets all the way to

142
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:39.310
desktop, and make it look really good for
all these different screen sizes.

143
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:42.938
To me it felt like way, way more work.

144
00:08:42.938 --> 00:08:46.842
But, I mean, yeah,
I'm getting a lot better at it now, and so

145
00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:48.188
it's less and less.

146
00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:53.266
As it gets Integrated into
your process ahead of time and

147
00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:58.669
your psyche and
you're just kind of used a flexible model,

148
00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:05.282
it gets a lot easier because you're
asking the hard questions upfront.

149
00:09:05.282 --> 00:09:10.934
But I would say the first few
sites it was like double or

150
00:09:10.934 --> 00:09:17.729
triple because each page warranted
its own set of midi queries.

151
00:09:17.729 --> 00:09:22.514
It wasn't like there was a common template
across lots of different settings.

152
00:09:22.514 --> 00:09:26.222
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah, I mean when we
started doing sites, we picked our own

153
00:09:26.222 --> 00:09:31.720
site first so we made a lot of mistakes
on ourselves, which I'm okay with.

154
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.937
And so we did that and it took us forever.

155
00:09:34.937 --> 00:09:39.708
And then we did a site for a client,
they didn't even ask for responsive.

156
00:09:39.708 --> 00:09:42.092
We just said, you know what,
we believe in this enough,

157
00:09:42.092 --> 00:09:45.637
we think it's going to change the industry
enough, that we're just going to do it.

158
00:09:45.637 --> 00:09:48.708
And we still met all of the needs that
they had at their larger resolutions,

159
00:09:48.708 --> 00:09:50.339
we just delivered a lot more than that.

160
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:56.365
The pricing was about 125% of
what I would have charged them.

161
00:09:56.365 --> 00:10:01.980
And we probably spent 175% of the time,
so we lost a little bit on the job.

162
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.460
But that was a no-brainer for me.

163
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.140
My team is learning a new skill set,

164
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.570
of course we're gonna lose
a little bit on the first few.

165
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:13.570
And I think that's kind of what it takes.

166
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.975
You kind of gotta step out a little
bit and you've gotta do it.

167
00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:21.601
If you're internal in a company somewhere,
I'm not telling you to ask for

168
00:10:21.601 --> 00:10:24.108
forgiveness as opposed to permission.

169
00:10:24.108 --> 00:10:28.290
But, I mean, start to use percentages and
components, and

170
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:30.835
then fix the width of the container.

171
00:10:30.835 --> 00:10:34.620
Just get a little bit of practice
thinking about that flexibility.

172
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:38.740
And then later when your manager says hey,
you know what, I read about responsive web

173
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.010
design, we should be doing that,
you can say, yeah, check this out.

174
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:44.950
Boom, one little change, and
all of a sudden things are flexing.

175
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.130
I mean, those are the kinds of things
that I think we need to be doing.

176
00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.680
We never fix widths of things anymore.

177
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.455
Even if it's a fixed width element in
some weird way that we're building,

178
00:10:54.455 --> 00:10:58.700
it's percentage based with
a wrapper that locks it down, so

179
00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.600
that in the future we can open that up,
we can set it free [LAUGH].

180
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.597
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And
then you mentioned patterns,

181
00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:08.376
that you showed responsive to Brad Frost.

182
00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.000
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah,
I haven't shown that.

183
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.472
Brad has a huge repository just full
of all kinds of different patterns.

184
00:11:15.472 --> 00:11:21.590
I can't remember the URL, but
you just search for Brad Frost patterns.

185
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.469
And he's Brad_Frost on Twitter, tons and
tons and tons of great content.

186
00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:28.463
This guy is just incredibly prolific.

187
00:11:28.463 --> 00:11:31.490
He's in Pittsburgh, he works for
RGA, really nice guy.

188
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.030
And BradFrostWeb.com is his site.

189
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.910
Just always generating content about
this stuff, a really forward thinker.

190
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:43.829
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And stuff like that,
the pattern library and

191
00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:46.718
also migrating to mobile first,

192
00:11:46.718 --> 00:11:52.510
I feel like has really reduced the cost,
so it's getting closer.

193
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:53.536
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yes.

194
00:11:53.536 --> 00:11:54.657
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: But, I mean,

195
00:11:54.657 --> 00:11:59.710
like you said on your own first
site it was probably three times.

196
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.998
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yes.

197
00:12:00.998 --> 00:12:04.367
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So, I agree with that,
you kinda have to go through that.

198
00:12:04.367 --> 00:12:04.969
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.

199
00:12:04.969 --> 00:12:05.975
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Those growing pains.

200
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.630
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah, you definitely do.

201
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:10.460
Other questions or thoughts on this?

202
00:12:12.514 --> 00:12:13.014
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Okay.
