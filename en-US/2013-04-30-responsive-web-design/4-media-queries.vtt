[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:06.800
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So
now let's talk about media queries.

3
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.714
Once we have our content and
our design sort of your responding.

4
00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:16.170
As soon as we find a place where
those are no longer in harmony,

5
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.638
that's when we need to start thinking
about larger adjustments to our layout.

6
00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:25.666
And we can do that with media queries.

7
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.718
So here's a few examples of media queries.

8
00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:32.697
These top two are what you might
find in the head of a document, so

9
00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:35.630
literally a link to a stylesheet.

10
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.819
And the bottom two are using the media
keyword inside of an actual style sheet,

11
00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.209
so literally right in line
with your other styles.

12
00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:47.138
The first one, I'm not suggesting
that you use all these together,

13
00:00:47.138 --> 00:00:48.970
these are just four different examples.

14
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.360
The first one we're saying we
wanna link to a style sheet, and

15
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.766
you'd have a rel style and
a reference to the actual CSS file.

16
00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:05.113
But we only want those styles to apply
when the width of the viewport is 30 ems,

17
00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:10.460
minimum of 30 ems so
30 ems or greater, okay.

18
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.940
And then here we're saying screen end, so
we're combining a media type with a media

19
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.870
feature and if it's screen and
the minimum width is 30ems.

20
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.800
Down below inside of your CSS file itself,
you could put a block of styles,

21
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.440
literally nesting styles right
inside these curly brackets, right.

22
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.410
And these styles would only apply
if the minimal width is 30ems and

23
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.840
the same kind of thing right
there with the screen end.

24
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.110
Let's break this down a little bit.

25
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.780
So media types.

26
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.732
Something that you guys are probably
familiar with if you've ever done a print

27
00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:45.240
stylesheet, nright.

28
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.210
Media print like the bottom
there in the link.

29
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.690
And you can link to a print CSS or
whatever you would call it.

30
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.160
That's media type,
been around for a long time.

31
00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.020
And there's a ton of media types that
most people don't really use for much.

32
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.430
Let's take a look at
a couple of those quickly.

33
00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.050
So all is a media type,
which literally just means all.

34
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.055
And if you don't specify a type according
to the spec, all is the default.

35
00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:14.423
[COUGH] Braille, embossed,
speech handheld, projection,

36
00:02:14.423 --> 00:02:16.110
screen, tv print tty.

37
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.720
I mean all these are out there.

38
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.750
Go take a look at the spec if you're
curious about what all these do,

39
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.740
the ones that generally we use the most
at this point are screen and print.

40
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.164
I've got a lot more I could say about
media types, and catch me on break if you

41
00:02:34.164 --> 00:02:37.293
wanna talk in more detail here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do some of those overlap,

42
00:02:37.293 --> 00:02:40.188
like handheld and screen?
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: No, sometimes when you

43
00:02:40.188 --> 00:02:45.870
just look at the list, that would make
sense, but according to the spec.

44
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:46.880
It's mutually exclusive.

45
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.459
You can only be one media type.

46
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.100
This has actually created
a lot of problems, and

47
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.500
we'll talk a little bit about that here.

48
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.790
So let's look at the other side
of a query, the media feature.

49
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.270
This is,
when most people talk about media queries,

50
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.390
this is kind of what
they're talking about.

51
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.060
You can see the min-width,
the max-width, orientation, color,

52
00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.818
generally their named value pairs or
just the name as in the case of color.

53
00:03:12.818 --> 00:03:20.632
So a named value pair would be the minimum
width name 30 ems is the value.

54
00:03:20.632 --> 00:03:26.350
And most of the media features
except a min and the max prefix.

55
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.670
Except in cases where it doesn't
really make sense like orientation,

56
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.630
min orientation doesn't
really make a lot of sense.

57
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.210
But you know min-width.

58
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.640
You could also just say width.

59
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.070
You could say width, 100 pixels or
width, whatever, any unit that you want.

60
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.870
But that's only gonna apply styles
when the viewport is exactly 100

61
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.720
pixels, you know?

62
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.640
So there's not a lot of use for that.

63
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.340
So these are just a few examples.

64
00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.128
Here's a list of all the others and
there's many more coming.

65
00:03:53.128 --> 00:03:59.210
Width, height, device-width,
device- height, orientation, aspect-ratio.

66
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.820
I mean, you get the idea.
There's a ton of these things.

67
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.060
Okay, again.

68
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.760
Go read the spec.

69
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.640
This is not a complex
specification to read.

70
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.680
It's actually very simple.

71
00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.770
There's a ton of really good examples.

72
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:15.400
We really use width pretty much that's
what we most people are doing these days.

73
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.167
If you look at Apple's home page, they've
started experimenting kind of in some cool

74
00:04:20.167 --> 00:04:22.210
ways with the height media feature.

75
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.350
It's really kind of neat,
some of the things they're doing.

76
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:31.010
Orientation lets you sort of
determine portrait versus landscape.

77
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.480
It's more helpful if you're
using orientation to use

78
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.720
it in combination with device width and
device height.

79
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.930
Let's talk a little bit about the
difference between width and device width.

80
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.910
So, this laptop that I'm
presenting on is a device and

81
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.840
it has a resolution that it can support.

82
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.460
It also has a browser that has a viewport
width which doesn't have to necessarily

83
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.380
be the same width as
the display of my device.

84
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.750
On something like an iOS device however,

85
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.700
the browser is pretty much
always full screen, right.

86
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.210
And so there's a little bit of confusion
about what these actually mean.

87
00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.820
But with is viewport width.

88
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.990
So if you adjust your browser width,
that's gonna change the width attribute or

89
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.520
the width feature.

90
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.890
If you were on an iPhone versus an iPad,

91
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.540
those have different device widths,
make sense?

92
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.905
Now, you should know too that an iPhone
is gonna report a device width of

93
00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:32.970
320 pixels whether it's portrait or
landscape, okay.

94
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.010
Cuz the device width in its
standard orientation is 320 pixels.

95
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.336
So that is kind of a quick summary.

96
00:05:42.336 --> 00:05:46.932
We don't generally use device width and
device-height because really what

97
00:05:46.932 --> 00:05:52.080
that's doing is sort of tying us down
to specific resolutions of hardware.

98
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.230
And that's kind of the problem
that we're trying to get out of.

99
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.860
This mentality of fixed width.

100
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.610
What you might end up doing is building
a bunch of sites that work for

101
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.400
very specific devices and
then something else comes out and

102
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.500
like say the iPhone 5
with a taller screen.

103
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.460
So now, how do you adjust and you don't
wanna leave weird layout issues there.

104
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:17.940
So if we use percentages and we use media
queries with a width, instead of a device

105
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.030
width, we can actually get stuff that
works well in between those gaps as well.

106
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.650
All right, so let's take a look at some
of these questions on media queries.

107
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.005
We're gonna talk in more detail here so
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm guessing the color was

108
00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:33.006
just like color versus black and white.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: You can give it,

109
00:06:33.006 --> 00:06:35.510
there's several color features.

110
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.460
There is a something about black and
white, grayscale.

111
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.060
There's also a number of colors supported,
that kind of thing, so.

112
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.620
Let's see here.

113
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.740
So we're looking here at two
different media queries.

114
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.090
Again, I'm not suggesting
you'd use these together.

115
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.550
These would be literally right
in your actual stylesheet.

116
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.790
So in this case,
I'm saying a min width of 600 pixels.

117
00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.190
Styles for 600 pixels and
greater would go inside that block.

118
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:07.381
Max width 38 ems and down,
styles would go inside that block.

119
00:07:07.381 --> 00:07:11.272
And there's,
in a really simple way to consider it,

120
00:07:11.272 --> 00:07:16.213
there's sort of two ways to approach
writing your queries, okay.

121
00:07:16.213 --> 00:07:20.596
Large resolution first and
small resolution first.

122
00:07:20.596 --> 00:07:25.300
Generally what happens is, if you just
take a really simple example here.

123
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.060
If you have got a site already
that's designed at say 960 or

124
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.900
1000 pixels and you wanna start to adjust
that site for smaller resolutions.

125
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.110
You might leave your existing stylesheets
with all the large resolution layouts.

126
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.980
Styles at the top, and then at
the bottom of that same style sheet,

127
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:47.950
apply some max width queries,
which indicate 62 ems and lower.

128
00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:50.830
So as the browser, or
as the viewport shrinks,

129
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.570
you'll start to trigger these
media queries below, okay.

130
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.790
And what you would end up doing
in this style block is you'd

131
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:00.490
be putting a bunch of
styles that are undoing

132
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:04.250
some of the more complex layout that
you've done at a higher resolution, okay.

133
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:10.580
So we call this subtractive CSS and
this is pretty, pretty, pretty common.

134
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.680
A lot of people are doing things this way.

135
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.650
In fact I think even in Ethan's book,

136
00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.160
he kind of talks about this,
as a starting point.

137
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.230
And small resolution first is
the exact opposite of that.

138
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.620
So you would start your CSS
file with the smallest layout.

139
00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.588
You're trying to build for between 0
pixels and whatever you think is a,

140
00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:33.471
whoever that layout starts to break down,
you know.

141
00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:37.783
And so then you would use min-width
instead of max-width queries at

142
00:08:37.783 --> 00:08:41.053
the bottom of those styles,
and apply styles for and

143
00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:45.090
these trigger as the view
port increases in width.

144
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.075
One thing that's important to note is
that styles here, 28 ems and greater, so

145
00:08:50.075 --> 00:08:52.468
all of these styles have been applied.

146
00:08:52.468 --> 00:08:55.808
And now these are going to
be added on top of those.

147
00:08:55.808 --> 00:08:59.556
And 53 ems is greater than 28 ems.

148
00:08:59.556 --> 00:09:01.809
Right, so this style block would be
applied and this would be applied.

149
00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:05.099
And the same thing in
the large resolution first,

150
00:09:05.099 --> 00:09:09.500
those are all gonna apply and
just continue to stack on.

151
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.765
We call this additive CSS because you're
starting with the simple and adding to it.

152
00:09:14.765 --> 00:09:17.425
You end up with smaller
stylesheets generally

153
00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:21.365
if you take this approach because you're
not defining a bunch of styles and

154
00:09:21.365 --> 00:09:24.660
then having to undo all those definitions.

155
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.760
This is a little bit more.

156
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.810
It's a little harder to get started with
this but once you've kind of adjusted your

157
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.240
workflow to adapt to this,
it makes a lot more sense.

158
00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.160
We do all of ours with this format now.

159
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.930
Let's talk a little bit about pros and
cons here.

160
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.748
So larger as first you get by default,

161
00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:46.719
you kind of get easy support for
older versions of IE.

162
00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:50.326
The nice thing about CSS is if a browser
or a user agent doesn't understand what

163
00:09:50.326 --> 00:09:54.050
you're trying to do,
it's just gonna ignore those styles, okay?

164
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:57.670
I mean if you don't get errors oouts,
it doesn't error out, it just ignores it.

165
00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:04.850
So however,
old IE is not gonna support media queries.

166
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.540
So IE 8 and older.

167
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.640
What that means is, if you start,

168
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.356
if we take a look at that
small resolution first.

169
00:10:11.356 --> 00:10:15.190
If I define all of my simplest layout,
or say it's just a linear

170
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.860
one column layout at small resolutions,
in IE, that doesn't support media queries,

171
00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.570
it's gonna ignore this and this, it's
gonna ignore everything else in the file.

172
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.082
So desktop resolution browser,

173
00:10:26.082 --> 00:10:31.180
older IE RE is gonna get of
a single column very simple layout.

174
00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:33.290
And some people are okay with that.

175
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:34.697
You know that's a decision you can make,

176
00:10:34.697 --> 00:10:40.030
but I'm gonna show you some ways to kind
of get around that in a little bit here.

177
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:44.200
If you start with your large rez first and
undo those styles, older IE or

178
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.337
any other user agents that
don't support media queries,

179
00:10:46.337 --> 00:10:49.380
you're gonna get that more complex
layout and then you'll undo it.

180
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:53.610
So you actually serve them what they would
maybe be expecting to see the largest

181
00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:54.910
resolution layout.

182
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.270
Small Rez First is more logical.

183
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.470
You're kind of building things up
as opposed to tearing them down.

184
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.070
But again support for older IE.

185
00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:06.860
And then small devices
loading all the assets.

186
00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.760
This is a little bit tricky.

187
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.544
Most people think that if I
put a media query on a link,

188
00:11:12.544 --> 00:11:16.140
I'm not gonna actually load those
styles or try to render them.

189
00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.350
Actually the truth is,
it's gonna make a request.

190
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.100
Even if the media doesn't fit and
if it could never fit.

191
00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.500
So you really need to be
careful about those things.

192
00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:28.766
If you do large rez first, a small device
like a phone is gonna load all those

193
00:11:28.766 --> 00:11:32.359
styles, make all the requests
needed in background images and

194
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:34.424
a URL that's referenced in there.

195
00:11:34.424 --> 00:11:38.816
It's gonna request the stylesheets, it's
gonna do all that work, try to render them

196
00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:43.044
and then undo a lot of that stuff, so the
processing is greater on smaller devices.

197
00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:46.592
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I get asked a ton like

198
00:11:46.592 --> 00:11:49.908
usually what happens as soon as
you talk about media queries,

199
00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:53.330
somebody says how do I decide
where to put a media query?

200
00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.630
What resolution should I put it at?

201
00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.430
And there have been people
who've written articles about,

202
00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.880
here's a breakdown of using analytics,
figuring out what devices are popular, and

203
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:05.540
here's what you should set for
your break points.

204
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:07.780
And I don't really subscribe
to that philosophy at all.

205
00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:14.330
I think that the best way to determine
it is to figure out where the layout and

206
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:16.120
the content no longer work together.

207
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.980
So start small.

208
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.950
Get your styles working.

209
00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:19.690
Get your layout working.

210
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.610
Get your content into the browser.

211
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.760
Start to adjust, and
as soon as things start to break.

212
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.990
So your line length gets too long, right.

213
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.060
Then you need to start
adding a media query there.

214
00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.660
And you need to across the system.

215
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.120
You're not building pages really anymore.

216
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.140
You're building a system
to display content.

217
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.870
So you need to think about it in
the context of multiple templates and

218
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.370
multiple pages, but you're really looking
for places where those break down and

219
00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.910
then you can add one of these queries
to actually improve that layout.

220
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.450
This is a tool,
the Media Query Bookmarklet.

221
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:57.960
If you just Google Media Query Bookmarklet
by one of my devs Rob Tarr.

222
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.820
And it's incredibly useful.

223
00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.750
What this will do, and
I'll show you quickly here.

224
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:06.270
What it'll do is actually indicate what
media queries are being fired, and also

225
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:10.310
indicate what the width and height of your
view port is as you change the browser.

226
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.220
So it's really helpful in finding
those places where you might need to

227
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:14.530
add a larger adjustment.

228
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.880
So I'm gonna show you that as we
jump into this next example but

229
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:23.370
what I'd like to have you guys do is add
a media query into the br-44.html file.

230
00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:27.731
Let's take a quick look here at that.

231
00:13:37.293 --> 00:13:38.535
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So inside that BR 4,

232
00:13:38.535 --> 00:13:41.778
again I just was playing around
with the image styles and

233
00:13:41.778 --> 00:13:46.608
then there's a media query that you should
put, I've put a little comment here for

234
00:13:46.608 --> 00:13:49.729
where I would like you to
put that media query, okay.

235
00:13:49.729 --> 00:13:52.086
And if we open up BR 4, and

236
00:13:52.086 --> 00:13:56.930
I run that bookmark that I
was just telling you about.

237
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.030
It creates this little guy up here, okay.

238
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.830
What this does is it gives you
the current viewport width and

239
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:11.207
height in both pixels in AMS and
it gives you your cursor position.

240
00:14:11.207 --> 00:14:12.893
And you can adjust.

241
00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:13.710
Oops.

242
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.927
Sorry about that.

243
00:14:14.927 --> 00:14:17.570
You can adjust the width and
you'll see that that adjusts.

244
00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.275
So what you might do is start small and
take this up until you feel like it's

245
00:14:22.275 --> 00:14:26.155
appropriate to add a break and
you can look and see.

246
00:14:26.155 --> 00:14:28.955
It's around 600 pixels or
it's around 30 ems.

247
00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:34.025
So this tool just helps you in time to
determine where a good point, where there

248
00:14:34.025 --> 00:14:38.189
is a break in the layout, in the design
and layout and you need to add a query.

249
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:44.440
So what I like for you guys to do is add a
media query in to be our -4 and to try and

250
00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.150
get that image to adjust a little bit
better at certain resolutions, okay.

251
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:53.350
I'll pull up the slides as well.

252
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:55.425
So we can see some of that syntax for you.

253
00:15:17.038 --> 00:15:21.210
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So we've kind of defined
our smallest resolution styles already.

254
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:26.330
So at the bottom of that CSS file,
we're gonna wanna add a min width query

255
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.540
which would apply at a certain
resolution and higher only.

256
00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:37.780
You could choose to use pixels or ems.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So where's

257
00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.660
the tool to get the pixel at the top?
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Media query bookmarklet.

258
00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.892
You just Google that, you'll find it.

259
00:15:44.892 --> 00:15:49.984
It's out on GitHub,
just drag it to your toolbar there

260
00:15:49.984 --> 00:15:54.733
and,
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: He's always updating it

261
00:15:54.733 --> 00:16:01.446
too so
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: There's

262
00:16:01.446 --> 00:16:04.430
a handful of other bookmarklets
that do the same kinds of things.

263
00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.681
This one's nice because you can move that
little window from left to right if you

264
00:16:10.681 --> 00:16:13.045
need to, if it's covering content.

265
00:16:13.045 --> 00:16:15.888
Kind of makes things nice.

266
00:16:15.888 --> 00:16:17.139
All right, let's jump back in.

267
00:16:28.002 --> 00:16:29.449
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So if we take a look at

268
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:34.370
br-5, I can show you quickly
what I did as an example.

269
00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:37.840
And then we will play around
a little bit with it here.

270
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.260
Okay, so I chose.

271
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:44.480
So you can see the styles for
the image here I've left, right.

272
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.548
So the foot right with
the max width of 100%.

273
00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:53.563
And then what I opted to do was look for
a place here where we reached that

274
00:16:53.563 --> 00:16:59.258
resolution, in fact the native resolution
of the image and it started to stop in

275
00:16:59.258 --> 00:17:04.629
the text of floating up to the left
because of it, kind of broke the layout.

276
00:17:04.629 --> 00:17:08.404
And what I chose to do there is set
the width of the image to 60% and

277
00:17:08.404 --> 00:17:10.842
give it a little bit of
a margin on the left.

278
00:17:10.842 --> 00:17:15.917
It's still floated right but
those styles above are still applied.

279
00:17:15.917 --> 00:17:19.128
So we open up a BR-5.

280
00:17:19.128 --> 00:17:20.517
Kind of play around with how this works.

281
00:17:20.517 --> 00:17:23.348
I've also gotten rid of some of
the background colors just to

282
00:17:23.348 --> 00:17:24.636
clean this up a little bit.

283
00:17:24.636 --> 00:17:27.301
But you'll see that works fine here and

284
00:17:27.301 --> 00:17:32.562
then once we reach a point where we reach
the native resolution of that image.

285
00:17:32.562 --> 00:17:37.294
I just quickly add a little margin
to the left of the image and

286
00:17:37.294 --> 00:17:40.713
let the text kind of set
up there next to it.

287
00:17:40.713 --> 00:17:44.132
So very simple, right.

288
00:17:44.132 --> 00:17:48.766
Simple little query, min width 850.

289
00:17:48.766 --> 00:17:52.635
We could set this to happen
sooner if we wanted,

290
00:17:52.635 --> 00:17:58.382
550.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: And

291
00:17:58.382 --> 00:18:03.278
you'll see that it actually just
happens much sooner as soon

292
00:18:03.278 --> 00:18:08.178
as the view-port width itself is 550 or
greater, okay?

293
00:18:08.178 --> 00:18:11.171
Pretty simple, questions on this?

294
00:18:11.171 --> 00:18:15.889
The rest of the day, we're gonna talk
in more detail about all this stuff.
