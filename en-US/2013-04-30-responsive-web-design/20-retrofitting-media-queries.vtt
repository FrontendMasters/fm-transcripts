2
00:00:04.465 --> 00:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So that's tables.

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.458
And again, with just 100 lines of CSS,
we were able to go from sort

4
00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:16.604
of an unusable experience at small screens
to something that's very functional.

5
00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.800
You require some experimentation.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.060
So let's talk a little bit
about how you might apply

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.430
styles in a retrofitting scenario.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.910
We covered large resolution first in
the 101 session but just as a recap,

9
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.420
your original styles go here and
then you could apply max with queries

10
00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.100
that sort of undo a lot of the layout
that you've done at smaller resolutions.

11
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.040
If you're retrofitting,
this probably makes a lot of sense, right?

12
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.630
Because this already exists.

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.040
They've got a site.

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.610
HTML, CSS, it's all working and
this already exists.

15
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.350
And if you could add a single CSS file.

16
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.827
Behind a query, a media query that
just had this kind of stuff in it,

17
00:01:02.827 --> 00:01:04.370
that'd be great.

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.150
But what we found is occasionally we come
across a site where they're asking for

19
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.013
a retrofit but there is so much junk going
on in their CSS that it's gonna take more

20
00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:21.630
work for us to undo all that stuff than
it is to just start over with CSS.

21
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.410
But I don't wanna have to recreate
their top resolution layout, right.

22
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.640
So what I really want is what I'm kind
of calling small resolution first kept.

23
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.470
Okay.
I wanna keep their original style

24
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.367
sheet and I want that to work
at maybe 900 pixels and greater.

25
00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:43.970
And then I wanna start with no styles,
mobile first up to that point.

26
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.080
The trick is, I can't apply those styles
at the same time as their styles are being

27
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.650
applied because if I were to do that, it's
gonna break their original layout, right?

28
00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.650
So this is what we're trying to do,
don't change the original styles.

29
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.900
Serve mobile first, CSS for
small view ports and

30
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.370
then just serve their original styles
untouched at larger view port.

31
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.681
So I'm gonna show you guys quickly a way
hat we're actually that we've actually

32
00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:13.100
successfully implemented this.

33
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.910
So again looking at the sort of
the head of a document here.

34
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.220
I'm using modernizer here and

35
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.130
this moderniser.mq test will test
a media query for you, okay?

36
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.552
So, all I'm saying with this test is,

37
00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:34.180
hey is min-width; 0px true?

38
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:41.060
Which is always true, if the browser
understands media queries, right.

39
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.009
So I can run this test to see if this
browser actually supports media queries or

40
00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.033
not, that's what all that's doing.

41
00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.360
And then this is yep, no.

42
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.000
So if this is true, I'm gonna load base.

43
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.480
Otherwise I'm just gonna give
them the original styles.

44
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.010
So if they're in a browser that
doesn't support media queries,

45
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.950
all my fun stuff that's retrofitting
ain't gonna work anyway.

46
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.740
This is given the original styles,
they get what they've always got, right.

47
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.850
And then a noscript fallback
to give them the original.

48
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.050
So if JavaScript is disabled,

49
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.570
in this case they're gonna get
the original styles as well.

50
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.489
Now let's take a look at that base CSS.

51
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.370
Again this is a SAS aggregate, okay?

52
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.800
So that base CSS is generated
by this aggregate file, okay?

53
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.440
Same kind of technique
we were using before

54
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.850
to build up a single file that
has media queries in them.

55
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.585
These are not requests, these imports,
these are SAS imports, okay.

56
00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:38.269
But what we're doing is we're applying
I've got basically three different tiers

57
00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.804
of styles that I wanna apply here.

58
00:03:39.804 --> 00:03:41.980
A small set of styles.

59
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.610
A medium set and the original styles.

60
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.610
So you could break these
down however you needed for

61
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.320
your specific project,
just kind of proving their concept here.

62
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.612
So if the browser viewport
is 979 pixels or lower,

63
00:03:54.612 --> 00:03:59.559
okay, maximum is 979,
I wanna import small.

64
00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:06.430
If it's between 661 and 979,
I'm also gonna import medium, right.

65
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.890
So this is true.

66
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.480
In cases where this is true,
this is also true.

67
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.580
So you would import this regardless.

68
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.930
And this is gonna get added on,
if I'm between these two.

69
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.650
So now if I've included medium,
I've also included small.

70
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.530
And then here, a mind-width 980 and
higher, I just serve them the original.

71
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.270
Okay, so
what this does is it's that capping, okay.

72
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.933
Neither of these two styles
are applied over 979.

73
00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:37.020
And only this is applied over 979.

74
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.880
It's a little bit crazy.

75
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.240
There's a working demo though in
the folder that shows kind of how this

76
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.840
actually works pretty well.

77
00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.631
Again this kind of stuff is like,

78
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:54.046
there's no need to figure this out unless
you get that crazy request from a client.

79
00:04:54.046 --> 00:04:57.950
But just know that there's all kinds of
creative ways that you can link styles.

80
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.870
Using this sort of book and

81
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.379
approach of media queries can
really get you some cool results.

82
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.747
Questions on how this is working or, no.

83
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:12.801
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Okay.
