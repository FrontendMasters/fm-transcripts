00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.261
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.261 --> 00:00:05.510
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: All right, so 101.

3
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:09.030
We started off with this idea,
the web is not fixed width.

4
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.680
A couple more stats for
you really quickly here.

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.260
In the United States,
the penetration of desktop and

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.860
laptop ownership is the same
today as it was In 2007.

7
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.580
What that means is that all
the growth we're seeing is in mobile.

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.150
I mean you guys know this right.

9
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.560
But you've probably seen this stat
that orange line represents the growth

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.670
of mobile browsing.

11
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.030
So end of 2013, beginning in 2014,
it's predicted that more people

12
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.970
will be browsing the web on mobile devices
than on your desktop or laptop computer.

13
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.530
That's coming really fast.

14
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.390
You know this is triple digit
growth that we're seeing?

15
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.910
My clients are seeing year
over year from small devices.

16
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.290
So this stuff is coming really fast and
really what it means the truth is that.

17
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.350
Flexibility has to be the new normal for
us.

18
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.130
And if you've looked at your
analytics you'll realize this, too.

19
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.540
That people are already trying to browse
your sites on these devices, right?

20
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.960
And one way to address that,

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.140
that we're gonna spend the rest of the day
talking about, is responsive web design.

22
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.910
So quick definition and

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.240
sort of a little bit of information
about where this all started.

24
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.610
You guys know Ethan Marcotte
coined this phrase?

25
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.160
In an article,

26
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.290
that he wrote in Alistapart,
just over two years ago, in May.

27
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.090
And this is a is a great article.

28
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.470
Who's read this Responsive
of Web Design on Alistapart?

29
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.630
If you haven't read this, go check it out.

30
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.080
I mean, this is like the starting.

31
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.730
This is where this whole
kind of idea started.

32
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.140
And Ethan is incredibly eloquent,
great writer,

33
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.020
just one of the nicest guys
you'll ever meet online.

34
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.610
And he's incredibly just really
defines it very succinctly.

35
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.490
He also recently has written
a book by the same title,

36
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.600
Responsive Web Design
through A Book Apart.

37
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.710
It's a nice short read, and it covers
all this stuff in pretty good detail.

38
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.680
I would certainly recommend
that you pick that up as well.

39
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.410
The way that Ethan defines responsive

40
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.150
is really there's three
kind of core techniques.

41
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.400
And you'll see as we get into this that
these are all primarily happening in CSS.

42
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.930
So he talks about a fluid foundation.

43
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.930
The idea that we need to
shift away from pixels and

44
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.690
fixing widths in our layouts and start
to use a more proportionate thinking.

45
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.190
He talks about flexible content.

46
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.390
Once the layout systems are flexible,

47
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.560
the content we put in those layout
systems also has to adjust.

48
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.290
And media queries,
when we find a place where the design and

49
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.980
the layout no longer work well with
the content that we've put into them.

50
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.250
We can to make larger adjustments in our
layout through the use of media queries.

51
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.820
We're gonna talk about
all these in detail.

52
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:46.930
So a fluid foundation.

53
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.414
Honor of the proportions of the design
by creating percentage-based grids.

54
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.971
Instead of fixed-width pixel based grids.

55
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:01.239
I wanna take this into some code quickly
and just get some really, really,

56
00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.080
simple examples in front of us.

57
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.710
So we can make sure we are all
on the same page here.

58
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.558
So this is a really kind of a typical
way that you might see grid systems

59
00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:12.242
being done these days.

60
00:03:12.242 --> 00:03:16.050
Using classes on a div and
some sort of a class.

61
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.590
In this case I just chose span-1.

62
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.620
That indicates that this div is a
container that should be one column wide.

63
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.670
And then span-2 is two column
span three three columns.

64
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.640
So if you can imagine that each of these
are say 100 pixels each column say

65
00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.480
100 pixels wide.

66
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.540
We have a 300 pixel column grid,
really simple, right?

67
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.120
300 pixel wide grid.

68
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.130
And then in your CSS,

69
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.760
you might do something like this
span-1 has a width the 90 pixels.

70
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.040
We're kind of assuming that the there's
maybe a 10 pixel gutter or something.

71
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.350
So that adds up to 100.

72
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.660
For span-2,
we would do 190 with that same ten pixels.

73
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.270
Really simple, right?

74
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.470
What we need to think about when we shift
to this more fluid of a fluid foundation

75
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.284
is how do we convert that
into percentages instead.

76
00:04:05.284 --> 00:04:10.010
And so in the case where our
context is 300 pixel wide and

77
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.920
we have a 90 pixel-wide element.

78
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.070
We wanna use a little bit of math.

79
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.510
And Ethan kinda walks through all this
in his introductory article there.

80
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.980
He talks about this
idea of target/context.

81
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.350
Really, we're just
calculating a percentage.

82
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.642
And so for our specific case, 90 divided

83
00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:33.499
by 300 is 0.3, which is 30 %.

84
00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:38.760
30% for
one column of a 300 pixel-wide grid.

85
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.270
So this is theoretical.

86
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.040
Let's jump into some
code really quickly here.

87
00:04:50.648 --> 00:04:52.810
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Can you guys see
the code all right in the back there?

88
00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:55.500
Large enough?

89
00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.380
Yeah, Okay.

90
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.230
So what I've got, this is in
repository if you wanna jump in here.

91
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.904
There is a z01-RWD 101 folder and

92
00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:10.054
inside that are five different HTML files.

93
00:05:10.054 --> 00:05:12.755
We're gonna start kind of walking
through these one at a time.

94
00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:15.890
br-1.html is what we're looking at here.

95
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.900
If I scroll down to the body
of this of this file,

96
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.820
you'll see really all I have is some
spans, some divs with a class of span.

97
00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.360
Just dead simple here, okay?

98
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.640
We''ll just put a tiny bit
of text inside each one.

99
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.840
If I open this up in the browser,
this is kinda what it looks like, okay?

100
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.380
What we're doing here.

101
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.090
Right in the head of this document,
I've got a little bit of css.

102
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.150
Quick caveat,

103
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:49.980
obviously, you shouldn't be putting all of
your CSS in the head of your documents.

104
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.490
This is just an example, okay [LAUGH]?

105
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.910
But you can see I've given the body
itself or width of 300 pixels.

106
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.023
I'm centering it with just a margin.

107
00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:04.431
And then each of the spans, span-1, 2, and
3, I've given a height of, a min height,

108
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:06.460
just so that we can see them.

109
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.330
And then flow to them left with and
they all have a margin right and

110
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.672
bottom of 10 pixels, okay?

111
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.110
And then span-1 is 90 pixels wide
with background color of red.

112
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.960
Span-2, 190, span-3,
290 different colors on the background.

113
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.760
And all that comes together to give
us something beautiful like this.

114
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.950
So obviously this is sort of our
fixed width version of this.

115
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.450
What we'd like to do is start to think
about how can we adjust this grid.

116
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.880
Adjust these simple styles in the head
of this document to make this

117
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.460
percentage based instead of pixel based.

118
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.680
So I'm going to I'm gonna open up
that slide that I just showed you

119
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.818
guys that had the target
of a context math.

120
00:06:48.818 --> 00:06:52.370
And I'm gonna give you guys a few minutes
to actually play with this file itself.

121
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.985
You can open this index file
up directly in your browser.

122
00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:58.240
You don't need to be running local host or
anything and

123
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.250
you can see just literally
just drag in your browser.

124
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:05.280
It'll open up and go at that code
quickly modify br-1.html and

125
00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.820
try to add some percentages in.

126
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.810
And so
that this thing will flex a bit, okay?

127
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.314
Anybody have questions on what
they're supposed to be doing?

128
00:07:15.314 --> 00:07:20.750
Okay, and just holler if you would like
to discuss or have a question, okay?

129
00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.900
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: You wanna to modify
anything that impacts the width.

130
00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:48.735
&gt;&gt; Ron: Do you use 90 or 100?

131
00:07:48.735 --> 00:07:52.784
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: For your body?

132
00:07:52.784 --> 00:07:53.620
&gt;&gt; Ron: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So

133
00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.290
the question about what percentage
should we be using on the body element?

134
00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.670
You can really pick anything you want.

135
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:04.710
When I do this on my post,
I set it at 9, so

136
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.610
there's a little bit of
something on the other side.

137
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.780
But we'll take a look at that,
too, here in just a minute.

138
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:10.280
Good question.

139
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.480
If you don't modify the width of the body,
then in the end,

140
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.390
it should sort of look the same
if you've done your math right.

141
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.340
If you leave that body
set to 300 pixels and

142
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.380
you adjust all the widths of
the columns to be percentage based.

143
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.840
They're still inside of
a fixed-width container.

144
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:33.136
So it should look the same
as it does in the fixed

145
00:08:33.136 --> 00:08:38.058
width mode.

146
00:09:00.575 --> 00:09:02.230
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Okay,
let's take a quick look here.

147
00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.623
So the way this is gonna run
here is that I've got br-1,

148
00:09:05.623 --> 00:09:07.612
which is kinda where we started.

149
00:09:07.612 --> 00:09:11.530
br-2 is actually a modified
version of br-1 and

150
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:15.817
I've gone ahead and
made some changes to these widths.

151
00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:16.900
So we'll walk through quickly.

152
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.290
Again, I haven't changed anything
in the body at all, okay?

153
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:25.150
Just made some changes in the style
block in the head of that ofbr-2.

154
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.550
So I opted to set the body
to a width of 90%.

155
00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:36.840
And I down here for the margin right for
all three of these elements.

156
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.700
I did 10 because this was 10 pixels.

157
00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.480
10 over 300 gives us this repeating 3.333.

158
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.226
I put in five decimal places here.

159
00:09:44.226 --> 00:09:47.160
And we're gonna talk a little bit about
rounding in some older browsers and

160
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:48.859
how this impacts layouts.

161
00:09:51.698 --> 00:09:57.308
span-1 was 30% which we which we kind of
figured out in the actual slide there.

162
00:09:57.308 --> 00:09:59.760
span-2, 63.3 repeating.

163
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.564
Again, the math is just in
the comment to the right.

164
00:10:03.564 --> 00:10:07.340
And span-3, 96.6 repeating.

165
00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.941
So now when we take a look
at this in a browser.

166
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:15.136
Here's our original fixed width layout and

167
00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:19.680
here is the same layout but
using percentages.

168
00:10:23.983 --> 00:10:26.450
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: See, you can kinda
see this adjusts its width now, right?

169
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:28.770
So now we've modified.

170
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.010
We've shifted mentality from this
fixed sort of pixel-based layout

171
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.070
to start to think about
things in proportions.

172
00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.661
This is what I meant when I said in that
first slide to honor the proportions of

173
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:40.898
the design, okay?

174
00:10:40.898 --> 00:10:43.610
And one thing that actually you asked,
what's your name?

175
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.140
&gt;&gt; Ron: Ron.

176
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.690
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Ron was asking earlier
about what should we set the width of

177
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.070
the body to?

178
00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:52.900
Well, in a case where I'm actually
modifying of a fixed-width design

179
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.910
to make it percentage-based.

180
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:59.650
A lot of times, I'll leave the wrapper
a container set to fixed-width.

181
00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.170
Just to be able to sort of think,
see if I did my math work out right.

182
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:06.838
So if I switch this back to 300 pixels,
okay?

183
00:11:06.838 --> 00:11:08.486
I'm in br-2.

184
00:11:08.486 --> 00:11:12.370
If I do that and refresh and
then sort of switch between these two.

185
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:15.970
You'll see there slight
difference here but

186
00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:20.880
generally this is a very very close
to what the original was okay.

187
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.754
So that's one little kind of technique
you can use just to make sure that your

188
00:11:25.754 --> 00:11:27.898
math actually worked out right.

189
00:11:27.898 --> 00:11:29.040
And you could do this.

190
00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.504
This could be any percent.

191
00:11:30.504 --> 00:11:32.578
So if I choose 50%.

192
00:11:32.578 --> 00:11:36.127
It'll stay, it'll basically leave
25% on either side of that column.

193
00:11:36.127 --> 00:11:38.772
So again, very simple.

194
00:11:38.772 --> 00:11:42.700
So let's see here.

195
00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:48.610
&gt;&gt; Ron: The 300 came from
the original body size, correct?

196
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.922
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah, so
in the context of a 300 pixel wide grid,

197
00:11:52.922 --> 00:11:55.750
each column is 100 pixels.

198
00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.506
So what we need to do is figure out
what percentage is 100 of the 300.

199
00:12:00.506 --> 00:12:06.018
So that it can extend beyond once
our container changes its width.
