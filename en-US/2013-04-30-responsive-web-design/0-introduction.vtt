00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:40.751
&gt;&gt; Ben: September 9th,

3
00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:45.950
2007 at 6:30 in the morning is
a moment that kind of changed my life.

4
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.790
I'm gonna get a little
bit cheesy on you here.

5
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.260
That's actually my birthday,
September 9th.

6
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.110
And somehow my wife had
managed to purchase for

7
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.940
me the first generation
iPhone without me knowing.

8
00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.170
Somehow, she got the credentials
to my iTunes account and

9
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.060
activated this phone probably
at about two in the morning.

10
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.820
She set the alarm for 7:30 AM,
snuck back into our room and

11
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.870
put the thing right next to my head
on my little night stand there.

12
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.150
And I'm, the whole time,
clueless probably snoring.

13
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.930
And she snuck around the bed, climbed in.

14
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.341
Laid there for about ten minutes and

15
00:01:21.341 --> 00:01:23.680
realized she wasn't gonna
able to sleep until 7:30.

16
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.590
She hopped back up,
went back around, changed to 6:30.

17
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.665
All this happening while
I'm still sleeping.

18
00:01:28.665 --> 00:01:31.240
6:30 in the morning boom,
my alarm goes off.

19
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.849
And it's the original
you know that [SOUND].

20
00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.280
You know that, all right,
you've heard that a million times.

21
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.690
And I have this moment where I
can see this in my mind's eye.

22
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.540
I'm laying sort of horizontally,
obviously, with my head on my pillow.

23
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.970
I happen to have my head tilted
right towards this iPhone and

24
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.980
I can see this glow.

25
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.470
And I hear that sound, and
I'd heard that sound on commercials and

26
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.820
other things but I'd never owned
an iPhone up to this point.

27
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.035
And it's probably been since that day
that I've been walking around with

28
00:02:07.035 --> 00:02:08.622
an iPhone in my pocket.

29
00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:16.310
Almost immediately, this kinda changed my
perspective on the Internet, on the web.

30
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.270
And you guys remember Steve standing there
with, I think, the New York Times or

31
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.830
some popular newspaper.

32
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.560
And he's kinda showing
us double tap zoomed in.

33
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.110
Swipe to the left, or the right, and

34
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.800
we get to see the article next,
double tap again zoom out.

35
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.440
And that experience was one that
he said the Internet in your hand,

36
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.860
the internet in your pocket and it really
has kind of changed our perspective on

37
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.380
what's happening in our role as
web designers and developers.

38
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.788
How many of you guys have
a smartphone of some kind?

39
00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:50.740
Okay, most people.

40
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.360
Those of you who have a smartphone,
how many of you also have a laptop or

41
00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.220
a desktop computer?

42
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.890
And those of you have both of those
how many of you also have a tablet of

43
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.390
some kind?

44
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.180
Right, it's crazy isn't it?

45
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.160
Look at this, 52% percent of laptop
owners also own a smartphone.

46
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.149
This is in the US.
31% of smartphone owners also

47
00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.655
own a tablet.

48
00:03:12.655 --> 00:03:18.756
23% of laptop owners also own a tablet,

49
00:03:18.756 --> 00:03:23.680
and 13% in the US own all three.

50
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.280
The past five years have
completely changed our industry.

51
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.340
We've sort of been faced with coming
to the realization that the web is not

52
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.890
fixed width.

53
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.850
And so
we're gonna spend the rest of today,

54
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.160
talking about ways that we can approach,
sort of addressing this truth, okay.

55
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.180
Before we do that,
a little bit of housekeeping for you.

56
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.846
My name is Ben, as Mark said
bencallahan on Twitter and on app.net.

57
00:03:53.846 --> 00:04:01.390
And you can check out my company,
it's called Sparkbox, seesparkbox.com.

58
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.496
We're a small shop,
there's only 10 of us, 10 or 11 of us.

59
00:04:04.496 --> 00:04:08.309
And we're always hiring good people.

60
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.364
We've only been around for
a few years, actually.

61
00:04:13.364 --> 00:04:18.340
And we've staked our
reputation on the idea

62
00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.440
that websites need to work at
a lot of different resolutions.

63
00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.320
I also was a founder of a workshop
series called Build Responsively,

64
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.460
it's just been going on this
year we're planning 2013 now.

65
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.680
Just kind of an opportunity for
us to get out and

66
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.760
start some conversations about
how this stuff should be done.

67
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.170
Opportunity to meet some really smart
people in some really cool cities.

68
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.820
And it's something that I've
really enjoyed this year.

69
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.450
And Marc mentioned I
really do enjoy education.

70
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.220
I hope that as we spend this day together
you don't hear me speaking down to you

71
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.860
in any way.

72
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.476
I really am just here to
facilitate a conversation.

73
00:04:53.476 --> 00:04:55.620
I've got a lot of ideas and
I'm very opinionated and

74
00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.896
I'll share all that with you.

75
00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:01.301
But I'm really looking for you guys to
jump in share some of your experiences and

76
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.260
let's figure out there are some things
we can all learn from all right.

77
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.510
I enjoy a good brew on occasion and so
I don't know if you guys got the email,

78
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.110
I tried to send something out to everybody
before but if anyone is interested.

79
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.410
Maybe at lunch time we can talk and
see who's interested in having a beer or

80
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.610
something after.

81
00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.030
I've distributed this little beer
icon throughout the presentation and

82
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.160
what that really means is that I probably
have a whole lot more to say about

83
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.330
that topic and I would love to
discuss it with you over a pint.

84
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.290
So if you see the icon really I can
probably put that on every slide but

85
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.130
I've kind of picked out some key areas
where I have a lot more thoughts and

86
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.990
just probably don't have time to
squeeze all that into a single day.

87
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.340
Yeah, so we'll try to figure out a time,
maybe this evening.

88
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.530
If you can't make it, no worries.

89
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.020
But yeah, we'll talk.

90
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.540
Speak up, I already said this, but

91
00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.830
I really am looking for
you guys to participate here.

92
00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.564
From what I understand, it's the same
group that's attending each of these,

93
00:05:56.564 --> 00:05:58.880
so you guys probably
already know each other.

94
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.080
So I'm the odd man out here.

95
00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.260
So don't hesitate to jump in and

96
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.780
ask some questions, and
contribute some of your ideas.

97
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.470
Also, in that email,
I mentioned this repository.

98
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.950
If you haven't had a chance
to pull those files down,

99
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.100
we are gonna be walking through some code.

100
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.195
I'm not going to get through all
the stuff that's in that repository.

101
00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:19.610
There's a ton.

102
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.340
There's 14 or 15 different directories in
there with lots of different examples and

103
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:25.670
some cool stuff.

104
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.880
So there's also a readme file in
that in that repository that has got

105
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.299
loads of links, resources on this stuff.

106
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:37.268
I haven't provided
the slides ahead of time.

107
00:06:37.268 --> 00:06:38.953
I will put them up for you afterwards.

108
00:06:38.953 --> 00:06:43.654
But what I'd like to do is see where
the conversation goes and then go back and

109
00:06:43.654 --> 00:06:48.900
make sure that the slides are accurately
representing what we actually discussed.

110
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.290
But the readme in that repo
has a ton of information and

111
00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:54.540
all the links in here
are also in that repository.

112
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.880
So don't feel like you need to jot
all that down or type everything.

113
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.330
You can get to that info at any time.

114
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.080
This is what I have.

115
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.780
I'm going to try to get through
all of this stuff today, okay.

116
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:12.010
I've actually got more than this in my
presentation and so I'm pretty flexible.

117
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.410
If there's something that you don't see me
covering that you want really want to get

118
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.350
to, make sure you bring it up.

119
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.450
Try to hit me at lunch time or
something and mention it so

120
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.720
that we can try to work
it in the afternoon.

121
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.590
But we're gonna start with this 101,
the idea of just bringing everybody up

122
00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.550
to speed with Responsive and what are
the three core techniques, what are some

123
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.860
other considerations we should be thinking
about as we do this kind of work.

124
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.121
We're gonna talk about process, and

125
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:38.572
I know that a lot of you guys maybe are in
the code regularly, but I think that

126
00:07:38.572 --> 00:07:42.479
any time I talk about Responsive I
try to also talk about process.

127
00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:46.162
Because these techniques,
they're sort of interruptive,

128
00:07:46.162 --> 00:07:49.292
they're disruptive with
with the way that we work.

129
00:07:49.292 --> 00:07:52.638
And for a long time I think we've been
trying to just squeeze it into our

130
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.970
existing process and there's a lot
of things that need to change.

131
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:58.660
So we're gonna cover some of that stuff.

132
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.050
We're gonna talk about
ways to apply styles,

133
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:03.110
because there's a lot of
different ways to do this.

134
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:06.290
And we'll get into some details on
ways that you can link to styles,

135
00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.960
and how you can write media queries and
those things.

136
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.930
We're gonna talk about retrofitting.

137
00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:13.950
Not everybody gets to start
over with every project.

138
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.910
And so, how are there other ways
that we can use some of these

139
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.379
responsive techniques on
more legacy type sites?

140
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.670
JavaScript to the rescue.

141
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:26.105
We're gonna talk about some really
incredibly useful poly fills and

142
00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:30.310
wrappers for HTML 5 API stuff
that's gonna be really cool.

143
00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.274
There's a ton of stuff.

144
00:08:31.274 --> 00:08:32.826
I could spend the whole day just on that.

145
00:08:32.826 --> 00:08:35.830
So I hand-picked a few of these
that I think are most critical.

146
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:39.900
Lessons learned, some stuff that I've
learned just from doing this for a couple

147
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:45.150
years now and then we're going talk about
what I think is next and responsive.

148
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.900
And I guess with that we will jump
right in any anything immediately,

149
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.200
you guys are seeing that I'm not
going to cover that you wanna get to?
