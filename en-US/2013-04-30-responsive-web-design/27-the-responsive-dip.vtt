[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:06.835
&gt;&gt; Ben: All right, so
I wanna close this up today,

3
00:00:06.835 --> 00:00:09.604
just I wanna tell you
guys a couple of stories.

4
00:00:09.604 --> 00:00:11.930
I wanna just wrap this stuff up and

5
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.130
tell you where I think we are as
an industry with responsive and

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.950
where I think we're gonna be headed,
where I think we need to go.

7
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.200
So this is a picture
actually taken in my office.

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.780
We were incredibly lucky.

9
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.860
We moved my three partners at that time,
and it was just the four of us,

10
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.900
when we started back in beginning of '09.

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.190
We moved our business, we had been
contracting with each other prior to that,

12
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.850
and we decided to merge and
really try and take it seriously.

13
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.440
We moved our business up to the top floor
just like a loft apartment of the of

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.250
the building we were in.

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.342
And the guy who owns the space
moved down to Florida.

16
00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:51.117
So he said, would you guys be interested?

17
00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:56.064
And he can get this massive pool
table out of the office [LAUGH],

18
00:00:56.064 --> 00:00:57.790
or of his apartment.

19
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.614
So it got left, and needless to say,

20
00:01:00.614 --> 00:01:04.912
we've played many games of
pool while we were working.

21
00:01:04.912 --> 00:01:08.406
And actually, we solved a lot of problems
around the pool table, cuz it's just

22
00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:11.555
getting your mind off of what you're
doing sometimes is what you need.

23
00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:14.430
But I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.902
I love to be really good at
the things that I do, and

25
00:01:17.902 --> 00:01:22.723
I hadn't played much pool up to
the time that we moved into the space.

26
00:01:22.723 --> 00:01:25.661
And so I think three days
after we got into this space,

27
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:30.010
I played a couple of games, and
my partners realized that I sucked.

28
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.730
I went to a bookstore and
bought a book on how to play pool [LAUGH].

29
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
And so I'm sitting at home that night I
got the book, and I'm reading through,

30
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.420
I read the first chapter.

31
00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.640
It was all about angles, and I thought,
okay, this makes a lot of sense.

32
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.330
I understand physics, I can do angles, so

33
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.310
I started to play the game
a little bit differently.

34
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.940
Really, all I cared about was angles,
and I started focusing on

35
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.230
making sure that where I
contacted the ball, the cue and

36
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.810
the next ball I was shooting for
would guarantee that that was gonna go in.

37
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.100
And I actually got a lot
better at pool pretty quickly.

38
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.776
Now, I was terrible to start with,
so a lot better is relative.

39
00:02:10.776 --> 00:02:15.583
But what happened is we play a game called
nine ball, and I don't know if your a pool

40
00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:20.408
player or not, but in nine ball, you're
supposed to contact the balls in order.

41
00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:24.575
So when you break the one balls
at the front of the rock,

42
00:02:24.575 --> 00:02:27.212
you strike that one ball to break.

43
00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:31.803
And then if it doesn't drop,
your next shot has to contact the lowest

44
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:34.820
number ball, so
it would be one in that case.

45
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.770
Now, the goal of the game is
still to put the nine ball in, so

46
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.980
if you can combo it in, you win.

47
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.740
But generally,

48
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.170
what the flow of the game is generally
that you put in the balls in, in order.

49
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.050
So hitting the first shot is great,
getting those

50
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.100
angles right is great, but in nine ball,
you have to do a lot more than that.

51
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.880
You have to position the cue
ball after you sink a ball so

52
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.857
that you have a shot on
the next lowest number of ball.

53
00:03:01.857 --> 00:03:06.250
So I got really good at putting the first
ball in, and I never had a shot at

54
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.570
the second ball, so it didn't actually
help me out in the long run in this game.

55
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.755
So I thought, okay,
something's wrong here, I plateau,

56
00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:16.814
and I was getting the first shot in, and

57
00:03:16.814 --> 00:03:20.014
I just need to start thinking
about how to position the ball.

58
00:03:20.014 --> 00:03:23.996
So I went back to my book, and I started
reading a little bit further, and

59
00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:26.300
I started to read about English for spin.

60
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.429
And I realized that if you spin the cue,
when it contacts that next ball,

61
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:34.014
it actually has a great amount of
impact of how it was spinning as

62
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:35.690
to where that cue ball goes.

63
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.520
So you can actually do quite a bit
of positioning of that ball.

64
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.820
So I said, excellent, now I know what
to do, I'm gonna start spinning.

65
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.300
So I get in to the next day, and I start
playing, and I'm thinking about the angle,

66
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.830
but I'm also thinking, okay,
the two balls over there.

67
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.570
I got to position the cue, so
I needed a little down to the right.

68
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.460
Okay, boom, and
what do you think happened?

69
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.360
I missed the first shot, all right?

70
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.570
I actually got worse at pool [LAUGH],

71
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.250
because I had been living in this false
sense of security that I had improved,

72
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.850
because I hadn't really
torn down what I knew.

73
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.641
And I had to just break it all down,
and start over, and

74
00:04:14.641 --> 00:04:19.060
I needed to learn how to spin and
get the angle right.

75
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.450
So I'll show you guys a little chart here.

76
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.570
This is my pool game over time, right?

77
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.630
So I started out over here.

78
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.750
I had no idea what was
possible in this game.

79
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.640
I'm on this side.

80
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.250
I creep up to the top.

81
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.100
I'm getting the first shot right, and

82
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.040
then I realized I need to start spinning
to be able to control the ball.

83
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.950
And boom, I go down almost as bad
as I was when I first started.

84
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.940
But now,
I have the potential to get a lot better.

85
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.320
And I had to go through this breakdown
in order to get to a point where I could

86
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.460
actually get a lot better at this.

87
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.280
I'm not the first guy to start
thinking about this idea.

88
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.650
Seth Godin wrote a book
about it called The Dip.

89
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.810
And even before that,
Noel Burch coined the term,

90
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.040
and she called it the four stages
of learning any new skill.

91
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.794
Today, we call it
the stages of competence.

92
00:05:09.794 --> 00:05:13.900
And I've overlaid those four stages
on top of this dip diagram for

93
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.980
us to think about a little bit.

94
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.030
So that first stage,
unconscious incompetence, right?

95
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.236
The world is new,
you don't know how bad you are.

96
00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:25.279
Unconscious incompetence, okay?

97
00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:28.504
That was me when we first
walked up to this pool table.

98
00:05:28.504 --> 00:05:33.241
And finally, you get to a point where
you're still terrible at something, but

99
00:05:33.241 --> 00:05:37.784
you recognize that you're bad,
you're conscious incompetence,okay?

100
00:05:37.784 --> 00:05:41.394
So you recognise it,
you're still incompetent, okay?

101
00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:43.953
There's still much more
competent people out there.

102
00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:45.338
If you push through the dip,

103
00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:48.124
you get to a point where you
reach conscious competence.

104
00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:52.216
In other words, you are very good at
what you do, you're competent, but

105
00:05:52.216 --> 00:05:53.280
you have to focus.

106
00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.830
You have to really think about it.

107
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.526
It's not second nature to you.

108
00:05:56.526 --> 00:06:01.262
And then, unconscious competence is the
final stage where you get to a point where

109
00:06:01.262 --> 00:06:05.947
you have mastered something so much so
that you almost don't even need to think.

110
00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:11.502
It's second nature, it's just in your DNA.

111
00:06:11.502 --> 00:06:16.848
And I think that as an industry,
we're learning some new skills,

112
00:06:16.848 --> 00:06:20.864
and I think that this
applies to us as an industry.

113
00:06:20.864 --> 00:06:23.883
We've been playing around
with these techniques.

114
00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.778
CSS guys and gals have been playing
around with these techniques for

115
00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:29.144
a couple years now, and

116
00:06:29.144 --> 00:06:33.743
we need to realize that there's a whole
lot more we can be doing with this stuff.

117
00:06:33.743 --> 00:06:37.599
We've got to start inviting some
other people into the conversation.

118
00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.964
That's why I wanted to talk about some
of the process stuff earlier today.

119
00:06:40.964 --> 00:06:43.842
We need to invite the user experience
people into this conversation.

120
00:06:43.842 --> 00:06:46.151
We need to get some
content people involved.

121
00:06:46.151 --> 00:06:49.704
Back-end devs, you were asking me
what can you do as a back-end dev.

122
00:06:49.704 --> 00:06:51.049
You're interest in this stuff.

123
00:06:51.049 --> 00:06:54.109
There are some real problems with
content management systems right now,

124
00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:56.730
especially when you start to
implement some of these things.

125
00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.640
So there's lots of challenges that we've
all got us put our heads together on to

126
00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.910
solve, and I think there's
a lot we need to learn still.

127
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.880
So I've written a bit more about this.

128
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.909
It's called The Responsive Dip.

129
00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:11.406
You're welcome to check that out.

130
00:07:11.406 --> 00:07:16.314
But the end game there is that I think we
need to push through that responsive dip,

131
00:07:16.314 --> 00:07:18.478
but we need to do that together, and

132
00:07:18.478 --> 00:07:22.806
the way that we'll do that
is the responsive mindset.

133
00:07:22.806 --> 00:07:26.250
Ethan Marcotte is very eloquent, but

134
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:29.580
he's also very protective of
the definition of responsive web design.

135
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.440
Obama's site, during the campaign,
was redesigned several times.

136
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.860
I know a couple of the guys working
on that site, but it was interesting,

137
00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.960
cuz they had done an adaptive
approach where they weren't using

138
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.890
percentages flexible foundation.

139
00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:50.800
They were really using
three fixed width layouts.

140
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.390
It's what they had chosen to do initially.

141
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.830
And Stephanie Rieger did a write-up
about it in .NET magazine.

142
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.604
It tore apart,
like it was pretty negative.

143
00:08:00.604 --> 00:08:02.760
.NET magazine tweeted about it and
said, hey,

144
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.250
check out Stephanie's review of
the new Obama responsive site.

145
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.788
And Ethan wrote back immediately.

146
00:08:10.788 --> 00:08:13.530
He said, that site is not responsive.

147
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.520
And it wasn't responsive
by his definition,

148
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.675
because there was no fluid grid.

149
00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:23.595
So okay, I understand that, and
he started this whole thing, so

150
00:08:23.595 --> 00:08:27.005
I'm not gonna speak
poorly of him in any way.

151
00:08:27.005 --> 00:08:30.307
But I do think that we need
to shift to a mindset.

152
00:08:30.307 --> 00:08:33.098
We need to start stop thinking
about the specifics of this and

153
00:08:33.098 --> 00:08:35.190
start to embrace it in
a more holistic level.

154
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.980
Check out this quote from Andy Clarke.

155
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.030
The truly responsive design web designer

156
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.330
wasn't born until after
the launch of the iPhone.

157
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.150
We haven't seen his or
hers work yet, right?

158
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:50.150
This is true.

159
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:51.876
How many of you guys have kids, right?

160
00:08:51.876 --> 00:08:53.468
They're playing with these touch devices.

161
00:08:53.468 --> 00:08:58.140
It's amazing, some of the speed
with which they pick this stuff up.

162
00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.900
Sometimes I work a little bit from home,
I'll be sitting at the kitchen table,

163
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.720
I have my daughter on my lap.

164
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.821
We type in something,
flip over to a browser, and

165
00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:06.600
she reaches up to my laptop screen.

166
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.450
She wants to touch that.

167
00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:09.970
Same thing, we have a big television.

168
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:11.890
A friend of mine has a big
television that's pretty low.

169
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.750
Kids can reach it, and all of the sudden,
the kids are walking up, and

170
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.940
they're trying to swipe things on the TV.

171
00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.920
That's just this is their mindset.

172
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:29.860
I think if we could start to think more
along the lines of these children, really,

173
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:33.000
I think we could start to do some really
amazing things with these techniques.

174
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.630
So let's talk about moving
beyond the techniques.

175
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:44.049
We've talked about small resolution first,
CSS structure today,

176
00:09:44.049 --> 00:09:48.692
but we haven't spent a lot of time talking
about the idea of mobile first process.

177
00:09:48.692 --> 00:09:54.876
Luke Wroblewski coined the term mobile
first, and he's got a book out.

178
00:09:54.876 --> 00:09:57.274
Same publishing company as Ethan's.

179
00:09:57.274 --> 00:10:00.124
It's book apart a really incredible read.

180
00:10:00.124 --> 00:10:03.098
You need to get that if you're
seriously considering doing some work

181
00:10:03.098 --> 00:10:04.029
in the mobile space.

182
00:10:04.029 --> 00:10:08.576
But the premise there is that
our sites are like the microwave

183
00:10:08.576 --> 00:10:10.550
interfaces we looked at.

184
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.740
They're just overloaded
with too much stuff.

185
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.190
Users don't want that stuff,
they really don't.

186
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.650
They have a couple things
they want to get to.

187
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:24.890
Your site exists to communicate,
and so you need to let it do that.

188
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.830
And mobile first process is a way for

189
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.170
us to look at things from a different
perspective, start to think about what's

190
00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:36.890
truly needed when your real estate on
the screen is so severely limited.

191
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.180
And if you can make some prioritization
decisions at that stage,

192
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.080
then you can start to ask the question,
are those things that you cut out,

193
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:47.400
are they really needed even
at larger resolutions?

194
00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.600
So mobile first process.

195
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:52.227
I think performance as a feature,
Stephanie Rieger has done some good, and

196
00:10:52.227 --> 00:10:54.846
Brian have both done some
really good writing on this.

197
00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:56.559
I know you guys talked about performance.

198
00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:58.200
Was it last week when you're
talking about performance?

199
00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:01.780
There's so much to be done here.

200
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.048
So much of this stuff in responsive,
it's gotten a bad name,

201
00:11:05.048 --> 00:11:10.610
because people are taking massive websites
and cramming them down onto small screens.

202
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.160
Of course it's not gonna be performing.

203
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.560
So we need to start thinking about ways
that we can implement these techniques and

204
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.090
still get performance sights.

205
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:26.010
Truth is users expect your site to be
faster if they're on a small screen,

206
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.180
they have a higher expectation.

207
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.300
And most of the time, they're not faster.

208
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:32.390
So we need to think about this.

209
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.920
It needs to be something that's worked
into the process throughout as we go.

210
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.066
You can't just make a site fast
at the end of a job, okay?

211
00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:43.910
Chris Coyier has some really good,

212
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:47.420
he actually did at
the Responsive Web Design Summit.

213
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.237
He did a really good,
I think his talk was called,

214
00:11:50.237 --> 00:11:53.940
let's do a bunch of simple things
to make our sites faster [LAUGH].

215
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.498
And really good.

216
00:11:55.498 --> 00:11:59.240
Just a ton of really simple things
that most of us just don't do.

217
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:03.210
Limit requests,
do some expires headers that make sense.

218
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.860
There's really simple things,
Gzip, all kinds of stuff.

219
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.740
The idea that the server is our friend,
we've been using server side

220
00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:18.350
technology forever to serve different
components, different versions of sites.

221
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.430
These techniques are really
well-documented.

222
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.580
I think we need to start thinking about
how we use the server in responsive.

223
00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.860
Most of the sites out there now
just completely ignore the server.

224
00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.500
It's all happening in
the browser on the front end.

225
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.480
I think there's a lot
that can be done here.

226
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.560
So again, in a single day, we don't
have time to dig into all these things,

227
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.920
but a lot to be done.

228
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:44.894
More modular content systems, Karen
McGrane is talking a lot about this now.

229
00:12:44.894 --> 00:12:45.821
Just really,

230
00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:50.850
we need to start thinking about building
systems to manage content, right?

231
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:52.980
We're not building web pages anymore.

232
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.070
We're past that, guys.

233
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.530
There's so much content in a given
system that needs to be represented.

234
00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.550
We need to do it in a way
that's much more modular.

235
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:05.860
We need to start thinking about content
management systems in a way that actually

236
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.550
is more closely related to what they're
called, content management systems.

237
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.430
They're not website management systems.

238
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:16.160
We need to build systems
that manage our content and

239
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.750
allow it to be served
to multiple channels.

240
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:21.730
I think there's a lot that
needs to be done there.

241
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.580
And then content and functional priority,
just I've talked a lot about this today,

242
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.670
it's something I harp on all the time.

243
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.564
I just feel like we need to
start prioritizing content,

244
00:13:32.564 --> 00:13:35.420
we need to start
prioritizing functionality.

245
00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.570
Those are the things that we can do on
the front end to make the experience

246
00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:42.190
a lot better when the functionality and
content is fairly complex.

247
00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:48.630
And then, I think there's some things
we can do to move the industry forward.

248
00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:53.510
In fact,
being here today is significant for

249
00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.900
me, because I love this man,
this is incredible.

250
00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:02.520
To sit down with peers in the industry
who care about the same things,

251
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.850
talk about some of the challenges
that we're all trying to solve and

252
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:07.770
just share what's working and what's not.

253
00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:12.550
This is how we get better at what we do,
so cheers to you guys for being here.

254
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.380
Apprenticeships.

255
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.095
This is something we've
been thinking a lot about.

256
00:14:15.095 --> 00:14:19.660
If you're in a scenario where you have
the capacity to bring in some younger

257
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.270
talent and get them in front of
people who care about the web,

258
00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:26.640
who care about standards,
we need to start doing that sooner.

259
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.534
Colleges and universities,
they're not educating

260
00:14:30.534 --> 00:14:34.790
the young kids coming into this
field well enough to do this stuff.

261
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:38.340
Think about it.
If you started university three years ago,

262
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.580
responsive web design didn't even exist,
right?

263
00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.500
Our industry is changing so fast.

264
00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.310
I sit on a couple different
advisory boards for curriculums for

265
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.220
these colleges, and it's frustrating.

266
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:54.520
They need people like you guys to be
on those boards to be asking the hard

267
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.380
questions, pushing them to
make some decisions faster.

268
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.140
It takes us a year to get
some new curriculum through,

269
00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:05.180
and that's just an initial pass.

270
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.590
This stuff, it's moving too slowly.

271
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:13.880
Our industry is changing way beyond
what we can do and in colleges.

272
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.480
And then, experimentation,
experimentation, experimentation.

273
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.480
You've got to start
playing with these things.

274
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.909
Don't be afraid to use these techniques
even though they're not fully proven.

275
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:27.040
Think about it.
If you don't do any of these stuff,

276
00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.310
your users are still gonna go
to those sites on small screens.

277
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.176
You're still gonna
download all those assets.

278
00:15:32.176 --> 00:15:35.480
They're just gonna have a much
worse experience doing it, so

279
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.010
we might as well make it
a little bit easier for them.

280
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:41.420
And with that, I will thank you guys so
much for your time.

281
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.710
That's all I've got, but I'll be around.

282
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.260
We'll have questions,
we'll have some brew.

283
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:55.904
Thanks.
