[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.185 --> 00:00:07.409
&gt;&gt; Ben: So,
in terms of priority deliverables,

3
00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:12.064
I'll tell you guys a little bit
about a content priority prototype.

4
00:00:12.064 --> 00:00:17.060
[LAUGH] This sort of takes the place of
your traditional wireframe for us, okay.

5
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.920
We're not doing highly
designed wireframes.

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.790
As much real content as we can get,
we put into these things.

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.960
So it's actually our customers' content
in the browser, it just happens in HTML.

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.840
It's in the browser immediately,
as soon as we can get it in there, okay.

9
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.150
There's almost no style applied to these.

10
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.130
What we're going for

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.434
is something that doesn't imply at
all that this has been designed.

12
00:00:44.434 --> 00:00:46.920
What we're really concerned
with is priority, okay.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.380
It's very linear in nature,
priorities kind of assumed or

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.900
implied based on the the order of things.

15
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.120
And then we do this in HTML..

16
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.970
It's delivered to our clients in
a browser, so they literally get a URL and

17
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.150
they get to open this thing up.

18
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.200
The very first deliverable in
the prioritization section comes to them

19
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.810
in their browser, okay.

20
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.297
This is actually one of
the most important points here.

21
00:01:13.297 --> 00:01:17.863
We're trying to get them to understand
that I'm not gonna give you a picture of

22
00:01:17.863 --> 00:01:19.189
your website, okay.

23
00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.389
We're gonna work with you In
the medium of the web, HTML,

24
00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:31.010
CSS, JavaScript, whatever other
functionality we can tack on, okay.

25
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.940
And we actually have this built,
this HTML, with a tiny bit of CSS is

26
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.010
written by our content people,
content strategists writing markup, okay.

27
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.650
Think about this.

28
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.710
How many of you guys have a process
where you do some of that strategy and

29
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.890
some planning, some you UX kind of stuff.

30
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.040
And then a designer gets the UX
deliverables and goes into Photoshop or

31
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.130
whatever tool they use,

32
00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.400
designs a nice nice comp, maybe they
do multiple resolutions of designs.

33
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.450
That's great.

34
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.380
And then that is handed to a front-end
developer who's gonna write markup

35
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.210
based on the design.

36
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:12.190
How many of you guys do something like
that, writing markup based on the design?

37
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.410
When we when we started to do this,

38
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500
it completely changed my
perspective on how we do this.

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.400
Think about how wrong
this actually is [LAUGH].

40
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.080
If I have my front-end developer writing
their markup based on the design,

41
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.960
it's almost impossible for
them to write really semantic markup cuz

42
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.640
they're completely influenced by
the way the thing looks, right?

43
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.510
We shouldn't be making decisions
about markup based on the design.

44
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.800
So what we do is we have our content
people start our markup for us.

45
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.160
These are the people who best understand
the content that's being marked up.

46
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.250
Markup, that's what we're doing.

47
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.740
We're trying to add, we're layering on a
layer of semantics on top of our content.

48
00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.880
That's really what we're doing with HTML.

49
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.440
And so
this has completely changed how we work.

50
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.463
Let's take a quick look at one and
it's not pretty, so

51
00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:06.274
hope you guys are okay with that [LAUGH].
&gt;&gt; Ben: It's actually out there,

52
00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:09.270
there's an example of one
out in the folder there.

53
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.660
There's a zero two plan design,
there's an HTML file in there.

54
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.567
This is it, okay,
you can see it happens in the browser.

55
00:03:17.567 --> 00:03:23.738
Hold on a second here.
&gt;&gt; Ben: Happens in the browser,

56
00:03:23.738 --> 00:03:29.833
get rid of some of these other things.
&gt;&gt; Ben: All right,

57
00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:34.690
and you can see it's completely ugly,
it's just grey boxes.

58
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.360
No real styling other than to just
indicate separation between elements is

59
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.310
really all it's doing, okay [COUGH].

60
00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.290
And as I adjust the width of this thing,

61
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.030
you'll see that it's
not really responsive.

62
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.600
Things are percentage-based,
but there's really no layout.

63
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.430
I mean, it's just linear
even at larger resolutions.

64
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.790
What we're trying to do is indicate the
priority of the stuff on the page, okay.

65
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.744
This was built for
a site call dressresponsively.com,

66
00:04:01.744 --> 00:04:04.332
which is actually out there.

67
00:04:04.332 --> 00:04:07.352
And I'll show you two deliverables here.

68
00:04:07.352 --> 00:04:11.311
They're both kind of based on this
concept, which was the idea that

69
00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:16.590
we're gonna let people vote on t-shirts,
responsive attire [LAUGH], if you will.

70
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.780
They would vote on t-shirts and

71
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.880
then the winner would get printed,
that kind of thing.

72
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.630
Actually, last week,
United Pixel Workers ran this one.

73
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:23.960
I don't know if you guys saw it or not.

74
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.300
So the idea here is just
dress responsively,

75
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.522
navigation, the big sort
of you decide 2012.

76
00:04:30.522 --> 00:04:33.520
We were playing on the election theme, so

77
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.860
that was some of
the direction that was given.

78
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:43.000
And this is, whoops not that, this is the
content priority prototype for that site.

79
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.120
So you can see Dress Responsibly,
the name of the organization,

80
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.470
the most important thing.

81
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.560
You Decide 2012 indicated, and
if you look at the markup,

82
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.215
you'll see how we've semantically
marked this up, okay.

83
00:04:54.215 --> 00:05:01.478
[COUGH] Anyway, concept that we've
really seen this as beneficial for us.

84
00:05:01.478 --> 00:05:05.508
Now, this works well on sites
that are content driven as

85
00:05:05.508 --> 00:05:08.176
opposed to function driven, okay.

86
00:05:08.176 --> 00:05:11.765
If you're actually building
something that's a bit more appy,

87
00:05:11.765 --> 00:05:15.942
a bit more interactive in nature as
opposed to something that's really just

88
00:05:15.942 --> 00:05:17.196
displaying content.

89
00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:22.009
What we've done there is actually created
a more static like wireframe, but

90
00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.983
we usually use Keynote or
something like that.

91
00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:26.745
You could use whatever tool it
is you're comfortable with.

92
00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:30.841
But we do those at smaller resolutions
to try and get some of the same kind of

93
00:05:30.841 --> 00:05:35.060
benefit of prioritization of function
in that sort of linear layout.

94
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.689
Questions on this, ideas, is anybody
doing anything kind of like this?

95
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.080
No, okay, all right, let's move on.
