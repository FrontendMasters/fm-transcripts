2
00:00:05.064 --> 00:00:09.911
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Let's talk a little
bit about client interaction throughout

3
00:00:09.911 --> 00:00:11.690
this process, okay?

4
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.090
Big companies with no mobile presence

5
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
seeing triple digit mobile grow can
create some pretty anxious people.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.960
And then you start to demonstrate that
we've been able to do some of this

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.740
stuff in less than half of the time,
less than half the cost and

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.860
we're seeing significant increases
in conversions because we've

9
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.729
built a better experience for
smaller screens.

10
00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.630
That creates desperate clients,
[LAUGH] and so

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:49.130
I've felt like I've had to kind of develop
this set of kind of questions that I

12
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.760
kind of force our organization to consider
before we take a retrofitting project on.

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.080
And I would encourage you guys to come
up with whatever set you think it's

14
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.990
appropriate for you.

15
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.340
But whatever you do don't just
always say yes to this work and

16
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.760
make sure that you have experimented
with it before you commit, okay.

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.950
Solid UX at higher widths,

18
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.700
so if you're working with a client
where they've really put some good

19
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.030
amount of effort into building a solid
experience at higher resolutions.

20
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.140
You're gonna have a much easier time
making that experience work on smaller

21
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.220
screens.

22
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.520
If they've got a lousy
experience at high resolution,

23
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.110
there's nothing you can do to make
that thing work well at small.

24
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.420
I mean you're gonna have
a hard time with that, okay?

25
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.070
So that's a real red flag.

26
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.160
Do they have reasonable markup?

27
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.580
Like Twitter was so easy to mess with
because the markup is very clean.

28
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.290
And this isn't always a sign that you
should say no it's just a caution you know

29
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.890
you need to take a look at
that market before you commit.

30
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.900
If you have somebody who's got their
entire layout built in tables and

31
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.260
they want to retrofitted that's going to
be a real significant challenge you need

32
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.770
to do some real experimentation before
you sign a contract to do that work.

33
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.290
Is it a scenario where
they can't start over.

34
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.390
You know.
Or is there an immediate need.

35
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.200
I mean in a lot of cases
clients are coming to us.

36
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.610
They're reacting to
something in the market.

37
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.360
You know in the case of that table.

38
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.900
They had literally their competitor had
just released a mobile specific version of

39
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.310
the exact same process and
they were like scared, you know.

40
00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.170
And so I said, well, okay.

41
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.510
And we took that job,
I had a two week turnaround,

42
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.760
we finished it in a week, you know.

43
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.740
And charged them probably a tenth of what

44
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.580
it would have cost to rebuild that,
you know.

45
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.540
And it's a step in the right direction.

46
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.050
It's just a temporary solution for them.

47
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.390
Real benefit for the user, this is the one
I kind of, this is like the purist in me.

48
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.720
I mean,
the only reason to do this in real,

49
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.790
the real reason to do this is to try and
create a better experience.

50
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.670
I mean that's why we're
doing all of this stuff so

51
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.990
make sure that you're kinda
focusing them back to the user.

52
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.880
And I'm always saying this kind of thing.

53
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.090
Retrofitting is a step
in the right direction.

54
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.810
This is a step we need to talk about
the next step before we finish this one.

55
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.750
You know so
they understand kind of where we're going.

56
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.130
And for your benefit.

57
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.890
You're going to want to make sure you're
capturing analytics this is what's going

58
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.460
to give you the data.

59
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.900
To kinda force them to
act on the next step,

60
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.490
even though you may have it planned out.

61
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.930
If you can start to track what you
can do with just a little bit of CSS.

62
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.530
It's easy to sell them.

63
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.450
Hey, if you let us redo this from
the ground up, you're gonna to have a much

64
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.890
better experience, you know,
you think those conversions are good?

65
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.430
Just, you know, just watch what we can do.

66
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.870
Constantly remind them of the user.

67
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.460
And when you're done and
they ask for more,

68
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.600
because I guarantee you that they will,
push for even better experiences.

69
00:03:48.164 --> 00:03:52.850
So, a real quick little demo
of some fun with retrofitting.

70
00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.170
I was just goofing around online
one day and realized that.

71
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.880
If I wrote a little bookmarklet
that would sort of inject

72
00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.710
some CSS onto the page and then I kind of
made that CSS dependent on the URL and

73
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.480
looked in a get hub repository we could
actually kind of build new styles for

74
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.066
existing sites without them
really knowing [LAUGH].

75
00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:24.880
So I started playing around with that
one day and I got some stuff happening.

76
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.010
So I asked somebody out there.

77
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.580
One of my buddies on I just kind of put
a call out I said hey is anybody have fun

78
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.202
some time for
a fun geek project this weekend.

79
00:04:34.202 --> 00:04:37.220
My buddy Philip Zastro wrote
back to me that he works at

80
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.619
Notre Dame he's in their web group.

81
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.920
And he said he would tackle
Apple's site for me.

82
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.250
So this is how Apple site works here.

83
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.400
And I created this
retrofitting bookmarklet.

84
00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.000
And since he's done this they've done
something with the background color that

85
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.600
creates this blue.

86
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.010
But you can see, he said he spent eight
hours, I think, or six hours on this.

87
00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.760
And I mean it's not perfect, right,
but he didn't touch the markup.

88
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.070
And literally, this is just injecting
a single style sheet onto their page.

89
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.320
Pretty cool, right?

90
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.540
So he focused on the navigation and

91
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.810
it actually works kind
of throughout the site.

92
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.820
Another example,
who reads John Gruber Daring Fireball?

93
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.570
Yeah.

94
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.320
Cool site.

95
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.380
Some good content, but
you know this is kind of what we get here.

96
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:38.460
One of the one of my guys in the office,
Andy built a style sheet for this.

97
00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.820
So he's actually, you'll notice he's
increased the font size, right.

98
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.200
Like we were saying before, smaller

99
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.440
displays doesn't necessarily mean smaller
type and I mean this is like dead simple.

100
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.770
There's like a dozen lines of
code total to do all this.

101
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.360
All the work is in the css which
is in the the GH pages branch

102
00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.740
of a repository in GitHub.

103
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.180
[LAUGH] And
all it does is look at the domain name and

104
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.860
inject a style sheet based on
the domain name, really simple.

105
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.585
So this just kind of goes to show
that there's a whole lot that you

106
00:06:10.585 --> 00:06:11.745
can do, you know?

107
00:06:11.745 --> 00:06:14.605
If you're interested in creating
some style sheets for some sites,

108
00:06:14.605 --> 00:06:16.765
let me know and I'll get you
hooked up with the repository and

109
00:06:16.765 --> 00:06:21.009
we'll build some better experiences.
