00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:08.720
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Prioritization, so
I wanna tell you guys a little story.

3
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.930
I grew up in a house where we
actually owned this very microwave.

4
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.056
That's not my mom, but
this is the amana radar range, and

5
00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:24.152
this thing is incredible, okay,
dead simple, I love this.

6
00:00:24.152 --> 00:00:28.730
It feels like it's cast iron,
the thing is massive.

7
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.832
It's got chromed front,
I mean, the thing is gorgeous,

8
00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.933
my parents still have this to this day.

9
00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:38.613
And you can see these two big dials and
two big buttons, right?

10
00:00:38.613 --> 00:00:40.574
That top dial, you can turn that thing,

11
00:00:40.574 --> 00:00:43.350
and it'll let you go up
to like three minutes.

12
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.150
Okay, you can turn all the way around
to the top, that's three minutes.

13
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.534
The bottom dial lets you go
all the way up to an hour.

14
00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:51.554
And you can see she's pulling
a roast out of there, right?

15
00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:55.837
[LAUGH] I mean, but the beauty of this
thing is really in those two little

16
00:00:55.837 --> 00:00:58.174
buttons, one is green and one is red.

17
00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:00.252
Any ideas what those might be?

18
00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:03.310
Yeah, start and stop.

19
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.670
You can't really screw this up, right?

20
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.020
They tried to figure out what is
the priority of using this microwave?

21
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.330
Well, you wanna warm something up.

22
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.440
And so, you put your stuff in,
you close the door, you turn the dial, and

23
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.264
you push the green button.

24
00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:20.451
That's it, dead simple.

25
00:01:20.451 --> 00:01:24.842
I grew up with this microwave, and
I still to this day am actually microwave

26
00:01:24.842 --> 00:01:28.049
handicapped because literally
when I got to college,

27
00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.204
this is what I started
seeing on microwaves, right?

28
00:01:31.204 --> 00:01:34.420
I mean, look at all that stuff.

29
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.650
No idea, I just wanna read you guys
a couple of what these say, okay.

30
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.515
Breakfast bar, lunch on the run,
one dish dinners,

31
00:01:43.515 --> 00:01:49.160
super defrost, and compu defrost,
I have no idea what any of that is.

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.490
And then this, believe it or not, is
actually a remote control for a microwave.

33
00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.030
So I guess if you're really, really lazy,
you can sit on the couch and add a minute

34
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.160
to the time that you're cooking your
popcorn or whatever, ridiculous, right?

35
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.160
Finally, I mean, I literally would walk up
to these microwaves and just stand there.

36
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.500
I didn't know what to do,
I just wanna warm something up.

37
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.320
Until finally, I found this little
button on a lot of these, Minute Plus,

38
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.330
sometimes it's like a plus one.

39
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.770
All this does, add a minute to the time
that you're cooking something.

40
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.896
And so this is my favorite
button on modern microwaves.

41
00:02:29.896 --> 00:02:31.190
If I'm gonna warm something up and

42
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.800
it says it's gonna take three minutes, go
to the microwave, put my thing in there,

43
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.220
close it, Minute Plus,
a minute later, Minute Plus.

44
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.180
A minute later, Minute Plus,
that's how I use microwaves.

45
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.260
And this is because I grew up
with this super simple model.

46
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.968
And I've yet to really try and
understand how all this complexity works.

47
00:02:51.968 --> 00:02:54.094
If you're gonna build a microwave,

48
00:02:54.094 --> 00:02:57.324
you better make it really
easy to warm stuff up, right?

49
00:02:57.324 --> 00:02:59.428
This what they're for.

50
00:02:59.428 --> 00:03:00.530
Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't

51
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.908
mean to blow your mind, but you can
actually hit the Minute Plus three times.

52
00:03:03.908 --> 00:03:04.482
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Seriously?

53
00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:04.982
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

54
00:03:04.982 --> 00:03:07.042
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

55
00:03:07.042 --> 00:03:07.764
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Wow, dude,

56
00:03:07.764 --> 00:03:09.542
I'm buying your beer tonight.

57
00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:14.990
[LAUGH] So, let's talk about
this in terms of priority, okay?

58
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.190
Cuz really what those makers of
that first microwave had done is

59
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.910
prioritize the real
functionality of that device.

60
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.580
What's happened over time with microwaves
is we've loaded up this interface with all

61
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.630
kinds of fancy features and

62
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.810
completely hidden what people
really wanna do with a microwave.

63
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.282
So I think we've done
that with websites too.

64
00:03:34.282 --> 00:03:39.520
Somebody was asking about priority
later or earlier, this is an example.

65
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.660
I love this example because I feel like

66
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.270
they've taken the time to really kind of
prioritize what's important for the users.

67
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:51.648
So this is what the other site looks like
at a large resolution, nothing crazy here,

68
00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.450
nav over in the top left there.

69
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.040
And if I take my browser down or
if I load this on a small screen,

70
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.140
this is what I get.

71
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.810
A menu link, okay, we talked about the
pattern where the nav lives in the footer.

72
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.890
If I touch that,
it scrolls me to the bottom,

73
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.110
all the nav that we just
saw in the top left corner.

74
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.030
No big deal,
I can get to that stuff with one click.

75
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.530
I can also choose to see the schedule,
the program, or buy a ticket.

76
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.470
Okay, those are the two things that
are their, in their minds, top priority.

77
00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.620
So what they've done
here is those two links,

78
00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.710
they live in the head of the document.

79
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.490
They're just hidden at higher resolutions.

80
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.240
They're inside the nav, if you drill into
the nav, you can get to those functions.

81
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.250
You can still do those things.

82
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.563
They're not saying you can't buy a ticket
unless you're on a small screen.

83
00:04:35.563 --> 00:04:39.629
They're just prioritizing the function
of buying the ticket when you're

84
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:41.310
on a small screen.

85
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.505
I think we need to start
approaching things like this.

86
00:04:43.505 --> 00:04:48.300
We need to start thinking about what
is that mobile context that people

87
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.410
talk about, understanding that part of the
time, that mobile context is very true.

88
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.413
I'm on the go, and I have very few,
a short amount of time, and

89
00:04:56.413 --> 00:04:58.840
a couple things that I really need to do.

90
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.767
But there's a whole other
side to those statistics,

91
00:05:01.767 --> 00:05:06.570
which is people sitting on the couch and
browsing while they're watching TV.

92
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.490
And those people don't want you
to restrict what they have,

93
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.676
what the capabilities are.

94
00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:15.320
But to prioritize things gives that
on–the–go user what they want and

95
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.720
give the ability to kind of get
to the rest of that content.

96
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.080
Really simple example, but I think that
we need to start thinking that way.

97
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.725
Also, to kind of follow up
with that microwave story,

98
00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:31.213
there's a lot of people who use your sites
and didn't grow up using the Internet.

99
00:05:31.213 --> 00:05:35.854
Most of us have grown up being
very familiar with browsers and

100
00:05:35.854 --> 00:05:39.137
using the Web and this whole interaction.

101
00:05:39.137 --> 00:05:44.118
But I look at my kids now, and
my daughter, she can take that iPhone, and

102
00:05:44.118 --> 00:05:45.680
she's two years old.

103
00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.532
And she can just, [SOUND] she
can open up whatever she wants.

104
00:05:47.532 --> 00:05:51.840
She's incredibly fluent in
that touch interaction model.

105
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.030
You put a mouse in front of her,
and she's confused, right?

106
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.980
It's just,
she's coming from a different paradigm.

107
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.420
Same thing with me and microwaves,
same thing with a lot of our users and

108
00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.420
the interfaces that we're trying
to shove in front of them.

109
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.390
So, you need to make sure you're
prioritizing content function that's

110
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.606
really needed.

111
00:06:07.606 --> 00:06:09.540
If you wanna get all fancy,
that's great, but

112
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.420
make sure you're not covering up
what's really needed on your site.
