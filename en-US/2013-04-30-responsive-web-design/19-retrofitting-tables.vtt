2
00:00:04.996 --> 00:00:08.810
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I got a call
one day from a company.

3
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.760
I'm not allowed to, technically,
I'm not allowed to talk about them.

4
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.260
So, I got a call from this company,

5
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.060
you would probably know them
if I gave you their name.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.560
And they showed me this thing,

7
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.760
this kind of process that I had to kind
of walk through with them on the phone.

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.706
This was one of those cases where
they said this has to work with,

9
00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:28.103
you can't touch the markup, you get
one link in the head of the document.

10
00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:31.514
And they let me put the meta tags in for
the view port with, but basically,

11
00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:35.041
this is where this whole process I
answered a bunch of questions through this

12
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:36.560
web app that they had.

13
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.755
And at the end of the app, it presented
me with this in a modal popup.

14
00:00:42.755 --> 00:00:45.019
And I'm on my, I'm in, like,
Chrome or something, and

15
00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.278
I'm looking at this with them.

16
00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:49.484
And what's going on here is,
this is sort of a,

17
00:00:49.484 --> 00:00:54.712
each of these rows represents a payment
schedule that you can choose, okay?

18
00:00:54.712 --> 00:00:56.570
And then the dates go across the top.

19
00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.790
So, if you choose 11 payments, you're
gonna pay 18 bucks a month for 11 months.

20
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.150
If you choose four, you're gonna make one,
today, one in October,

21
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.560
one in December, and one in February.

22
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.710
So you could choose,
the user got a choice, and

23
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.500
the prices were different for them.

24
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.150
The total price paid
is a little different,

25
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.675
if you make that payment right upfront.

26
00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:19.879
Paid in full, 152 bucks, so I got to this
point in the in this explanation and

27
00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:25.690
I said, there's, I don't think we can
do anything with this, this is a table.

28
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.490
It's in a modal, it's like,

29
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.860
there's just too many things that I
thought to over to try and overcome.

30
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.120
But I had at least
learned enough to think,

31
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.484
maybe I should just try to
experiment a little bit.

32
00:01:36.484 --> 00:01:42.930
So again, in that repository,
there's a /tables folder, but

33
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.350
I'm just gonna show you a little bit
about kind of how that worked out for us.

34
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.996
So, I've kinda taken that and
kinda mocked it up as a demo here.

35
00:01:51.996 --> 00:01:57.624
[SOUND] So I mean,
this is a pretty standard table,

36
00:01:57.624 --> 00:02:01.650
table with a header, th is inside.

37
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.520
Width's being specified right here.

38
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.560
This kind of stuff was in there,
some inline styles,

39
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440
some of those kinds of things, whatever.

40
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.440
And there was some styles to kind
of make it look the way it looked.

41
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.770
And what I did,
basically was write a single HTML,

42
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.140
CSS file that got applied to this.

43
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.933
Let me just, kinda.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So here's that table,

44
00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:30.110
before any of my styles
are applied except one rule.

45
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.580
So I had one media query that was applied
at like below 500 pixels or something,

46
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.360
and I've got as you can see one rule right
here, background color red on the body.

47
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.720
So that I could tell that it was firing.

48
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.050
Everything else is commented out in there.

49
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.370
So when I get below a certain point,
you can see that,

50
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.060
that mediocrity is being applied.

51
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.410
That those styles are being loaded.

52
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.990
So, as I kinda just walk through this.

53
00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.950
So here's the style we just
talked about box sizing, right?

54
00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.970
I wanna head and applied that by default.

55
00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.090
And then I gave the table
itself a width and a border.

56
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.100
And you'll see that at this point,
it doesn't really take much effect.

57
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.710
But as I start to get through some
of these other elements, you'll see.

58
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.500
So now I'm just giving
the table cells themselves,

59
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.510
table headers and
TDs are getting a display block,

60
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.020
they're floating left, text aligning,
a little bit of a border.

61
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.860
Those kinds of things.

62
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.200
And now, we start to get it so that it
actually fits right on on a screen.

63
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.598
Still, obviously not perfect and

64
00:03:36.598 --> 00:03:41.190
we have all this stuff now which is
kind of lost a bit of its meaning.

65
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.284
Because the table's no longer really
working in columns like it was.

66
00:03:47.284 --> 00:03:48.942
[COUGH] So if I just,

67
00:03:48.942 --> 00:03:55.000
I decided I would take the headers
which was that left column.

68
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.180
I'm sorry, the top column.

69
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.364
And you kind of see the top
on the left are both th.

70
00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:05.150
So we've got this nine payments,
right here, right?

71
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.510
Is now being represented in a full width,
100% wide cell.

72
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.420
Okay, so I've just taken that cell.

73
00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.080
I gave a display block already above and
I just set its width to 100%.

74
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.700
Now, it also means that all of these
are 100% which is kind of ugly.

75
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:26.336
I'm actually just gonna hide those
a little later, I'll show you.

76
00:04:26.336 --> 00:04:31.980
But the TDs where all the actual data is,
width of 25%, give them a minimum height

77
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.000
of 3ms, and now all the sudden,
they kinda fit in a nice little grid.

78
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.583
Just literally, just I mean,
we've used tables for

79
00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:44.360
years to do crazy stuff with our layouts.

80
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.460
All we're doing is just kind of,
okay well,

81
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.220
we know we can do some
crazy stuff with tables.

82
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.950
Let's let's style it a little bit.

83
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.270
That top row up there,
I'm just gonna hide it.

84
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.537
I mean at this point,
I'm not allowed to touch the markup.

85
00:04:56.537 --> 00:05:00.530
We're talking about a dozen
text attributes, essentially.

86
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:05.270
So now I've got something that's
actually pretty readable,

87
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.930
but I just hid all the dates, right?

88
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.880
The dates across the top, so

89
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.800
it's very unclear to me as a user
when I'm gonna make these payments.

90
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.080
I can tell that I have four
payments of 40, 30, 30,

91
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.320
30 but
I don't know when those are gonna happen.

92
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.707
And you'll notice that this on the server
was being generated dynamically, so

93
00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:30.259
they were looking at
the current date today and

94
00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:34.007
calculating a month from that day and
writing that in on the server.

95
00:05:34.007 --> 00:05:35.956
There's no way I can do that in CSS,
right?

96
00:05:35.956 --> 00:05:39.012
I can't, I mean,
we're talking about getting crazy,

97
00:05:39.012 --> 00:05:41.050
[LAUGH] if I try to solve that in CSS.

98
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.878
So, I started to think
a little bit about what

99
00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:50.844
we could do and
I started experimenting a bit.

100
00:05:50.844 --> 00:05:55.290
What I ended up doing is using
some generated content here.

101
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.689
And what I've done is actually,
you can see I added in the word,

102
00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:07.776
today using CSS with a content,
a generated content in CSS.

103
00:06:07.776 --> 00:06:10.690
So now in this case,
I have to know about my table, right?

104
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.200
I have to understand that the second td,

105
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.984
td:nth-child(2) is today, right?

106
00:06:19.984 --> 00:06:25.228
Cuz the first one was the column on
the left that had the payment information,

107
00:06:25.228 --> 00:06:26.930
the number of payments.

108
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:31.848
So now I can do the exact same
exact same thing with each of

109
00:06:31.848 --> 00:06:34.787
these using nth-child, okay?

110
00:06:34.787 --> 00:06:38.924
So I'm just going down the row and
I'm adding in month two, month three,

111
00:06:38.924 --> 00:06:39.676
month four.

112
00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:45.100
So a more a generic version of what they
had previously at larger resolutions.

113
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.950
And you'll see that quickly that,

114
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.680
that at least makes the content
understandable to my user, right?

115
00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.110
So now it's clear that if
I choose nine payments.

116
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:55.860
I gotta pay 32 bucks today.

117
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.610
The second month, I'll owe 20,
third month I'll owe 20,

118
00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:01.140
fourth month, etcetera, right?

119
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.020
Same thing with sixth.

120
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.510
I can see that I don't make
a payment on the third month.

121
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.420
So again this is, if you're building this
from scratch, do not do it this way.

122
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.100
Right?

123
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.270
You don't want your content that
like actually important content

124
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.750
to be generated by CSS,
that's not really what the intent is.

125
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.750
But in a scenario where you're trying
to build a better experience on

126
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.830
a small screen.

127
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.710
If my choice is to do
something like this or

128
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.795
to give them unmanageable table,
I'm gonna choose this.

129
00:07:28.795 --> 00:07:34.230
So, just a couple more styles that kind
of hide some of those empty cells.

130
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:37.824
So you can see over here that some
of these aren't quite working and

131
00:07:37.824 --> 00:07:41.366
I've got some empty stuff, and
I need to get rid of some of those.

132
00:07:41.366 --> 00:07:47.582
So I can just do display non on a handful
of those, to get some of those gone.

133
00:07:47.582 --> 00:07:53.811
And then finally, that paid in full, that
last one is just a single element always,

134
00:07:53.811 --> 00:07:58.050
so I'm just gonna set that
one to 100% and, ta-dah.

135
00:07:58.050 --> 00:07:58.650
Pretty cool right?

136
00:07:59.672 --> 00:08:05.390
I mean, that's just,
it's 100 lines of CSS to do that, and

137
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.730
this actually ended up working for them.

138
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.906
So we took that project and
we built with a single CSS file,

139
00:08:11.906 --> 00:08:16.434
we were able to build a much,
much better experience for them.

140
00:08:16.434 --> 00:08:21.412
Again, kind of with the understanding that
this is a step in the right direction.

141
00:08:21.412 --> 00:08:24.864
And if you're gonna use these
techniques on older sites,

142
00:08:24.864 --> 00:08:28.810
you need to be planning that next phase,
which is coming back in and

143
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:31.940
rethinking the usability
at smaller resolutions.

144
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:32.810
Questions on this?

145
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.350
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This is super awesome, but

146
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.820
what gives you the thought or

147
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.208
inspiration to actually think
to do something like this?

148
00:08:42.208 --> 00:08:48.740
Where, what's the process look like to
thinking, well, I need this to be nicer.

149
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.680
I guess,
a creative infusion kind of happens there,

150
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.300
and I'm not sure where I get that.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: It's experimentation,

151
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.490
is really all it is.

152
00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:02.300
I mean, literally, in 30 minutes of me
just playing around in the inspector,

153
00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.970
like I showed with Twitter.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

154
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.530
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: That's exactly all I did.

155
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.690
I just started floating things.

156
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.010
I said, I don't know.

157
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:12.560
I've never tried to set a TD as
a display block and float it left, and

158
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.090
set the width.

159
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.450
I never tried that before,
what if I do it?

160
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.080
Let's see if it works.

161
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.520
And after a little bit of experimentation
quickly realizing that I could actually

162
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.160
do that, that just opens up a whole world

163
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.070
of possibilities of ways that
you could adjust the table.

164
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.220
So, I think it's, I don't know,

165
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:35.150
it's just, I guess it's kind of just,
again my instinct was to say there's

166
00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.620
no way we can do this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

167
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.530
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: This is the point where

168
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:41.260
I'm saying, stop talking to me on
the phone, you're wasting my time.

169
00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:44.563
But I was just willing to kinda try it.

170
00:09:44.563 --> 00:09:46.009
I guess that's it, an experiment.

171
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:47.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah?

172
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.761
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: This is a similar question.

173
00:09:48.761 --> 00:09:52.918
You showed the example of the Twitter
site, where you're making them stretch.

174
00:09:52.918 --> 00:09:54.383
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.

175
00:09:54.383 --> 00:09:56.877
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The techniques you did were

176
00:09:56.877 --> 00:09:59.269
possible for a long time.

177
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.957
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right.

178
00:09:59.957 --> 00:10:00.457
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.

179
00:10:00.457 --> 00:10:01.546
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So why didn't they do

180
00:10:01.546 --> 00:10:03.556
in that?
I'm just curious cuz-

181
00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:04.278
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: [LAUGH] Because

182
00:10:04.278 --> 00:10:06.580
why didn't Twitter do it?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah

183
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:07.906
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Because we've been

184
00:10:07.906 --> 00:10:10.012
building sites as fixed width,

185
00:10:10.012 --> 00:10:15.480
we've been thinking about the web is as if
it's fixed width for a long, long time.

186
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.995
I mean, I can remember
sitting at an event apart and

187
00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:26.406
Eric Meyer was on stage, and he was
presenting some some cool CSS thing.

188
00:10:26.406 --> 00:10:32.306
And somebody asked him,
can we start designing our websites for

189
00:10:32.306 --> 00:10:34.606
800 by 600, yet?

190
00:10:34.606 --> 00:10:40.113
And I mean it just shows how it
entrenched in that mentality we've been,

191
00:10:40.113 --> 00:10:46.072
they wanted to know what they were asking
is, our global analytics indicating

192
00:10:46.072 --> 00:10:51.968
that enough people are using monitors
that are bigger than some resolution.

193
00:10:51.968 --> 00:10:54.490
So that we can start designing
our sites at that size.

194
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.630
And he answered, he said, well,

195
00:10:57.630 --> 00:11:03.260
you shouldn't be asking me
about the global analytics.

196
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:06.880
You should be looking at
the analytics of your specific site.

197
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.527
I mean, he was saying at the time, if
you're doing a website for an old people's

198
00:11:10.527 --> 00:11:13.816
home, they may have much smaller displays,
and their type maybe huge.

199
00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:18.110
And so no, you can't do that,
you need to serve them where they are.

200
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.710
But nobody was really thinking about
this idea of embracing the fact that

201
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:27.050
you could set your browser in
a different width than your display.

202
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:33.260
So, I mean there were people talking about
liquid layouts and those kinds of things.

203
00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:37.851
I think when media queries, when Ethan
connected liquid layout kind of techniques

204
00:11:37.851 --> 00:11:42.047
for that fluid foundation with a media
query, which lets you adjust a much,

205
00:11:42.047 --> 00:11:44.229
make a much larger adjustment layout.

206
00:11:44.229 --> 00:11:47.430
That's when it was like,
light bulbs, everywhere going off.

207
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.870
You're right.

208
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:52.090
We have been changing the width
of our browser forever and

209
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:53.760
all the sites that are fixed width.

210
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.030
If I take Twitter and make my,

211
00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:01.470
view that site full width in my desktop
that's like my big old cinema display.

212
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:04.360
It's like, I could fit three
Twitter websites on that.

213
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.000
I mean there's massive
spaces on either side.

214
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.660
I mean, I think, we should be
rewarding users with big displays.

215
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.210
There's all kinds of
techniques we could use.

216
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:17.670
These exact same techniques that we could
use to do some really fun stuff for

217
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.990
people with bigger resolutions.

218
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.870
So there's lots more to think
about than just small, and

219
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.340
I don't know why Twitter didn't do it.

220
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.610
Twitter has a separate mobile site,
I think, so if you hit their site with

221
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.250
a small device, you actually get
redirected to the mobile Twitter site.

222
00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:37.660
So they've chosen to do it that way, and
they're actually having great success.

223
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.430
More people are using Twitter in
the mobile web than on the on apps,

224
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:43.925
partly because they're killing
all the apps that use them.

225
00:12:43.925 --> 00:12:48.682
[LAUGH] I don't know if that answered
your question or not but, yeah.

226
00:12:48.682 --> 00:12:50.926
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And also, looking at your

227
00:12:50.926 --> 00:12:57.454
own analytics, that's not always a great
picture of what's possible because for

228
00:12:57.454 --> 00:13:01.942
instance, people that
either will side on mobile,

229
00:13:01.942 --> 00:13:06.246
will not come back to it, if it's bad.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Sure.

230
00:13:06.246 --> 00:13:06.806
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: If you

231
00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:09.270
made it mobile friendly,

232
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.633
maybe you get a lot more traffic.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.

233
00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:13.917
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: And that's like,

234
00:13:13.917 --> 00:13:19.213
quite a few cases when you revamp your
site to make it mobile friendly, then all

235
00:13:19.213 --> 00:13:23.249
the sudden, your mobile traffic doubles.
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah, people aren't

236
00:13:23.249 --> 00:13:25.389
afraid to come there anymore.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Right.

237
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.903
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah, and

238
00:13:25.903 --> 00:13:29.563
it's funny cuz I've used that kind of
an argument with clients in the past,

239
00:13:29.563 --> 00:13:32.207
too, where they've said to me,
hey, you know what?

240
00:13:32.207 --> 00:13:36.017
It's cool, all that stuff you're doing for
mobile, but

241
00:13:36.017 --> 00:13:39.636
I also have a big population
that's still using IE7.

242
00:13:39.636 --> 00:13:42.570
10% of my traffic is still on IE7.

243
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.990
So, what are we gonna do,
it needs to look and

244
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.910
function just like it does
on the modern browsers.

245
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:51.440
And usually, I'll say to them, okay,
let's talk about analytics for

246
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.150
a little bit, okay?

247
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:57.432
So what, let's look at the growth
rate of IE7, people browsing IE7.

248
00:13:57.432 --> 00:13:59.560
What do you think that
growth rate looks like?

249
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.460
Right?

250
00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.190
Yeah.

251
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:04.014
And what do you think the growth rate for
people using modern,

252
00:14:04.014 --> 00:14:05.217
smaller devices is like.

253
00:14:05.217 --> 00:14:09.116
I mean, I can spend,
hours and hours, and hours,

254
00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:13.674
trying to make your site
function picture perfect on IE7.

255
00:14:13.674 --> 00:14:16.620
Or we can just say, you know what,
let's give them the content, that's great.

256
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.901
But let's invest that money doing
something else, like building for

257
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:20.685
the future.

258
00:14:20.685 --> 00:14:26.511
So that's kind of an argument that you
can't, like nobody's gonna say no to that.

259
00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:30.402
At least I haven't had them say no yet,
[LAUGH] so.

260
00:14:30.402 --> 00:14:33.330
Now, that doesn't mean we should
ignore those older browsers.

261
00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:37.350
We still need, the content should still be
available to those to those individuals,

262
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:38.450
so.

263
00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.510
Other questions on this, okay?
