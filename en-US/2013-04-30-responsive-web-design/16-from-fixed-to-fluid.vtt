[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.380
&gt;&gt; Ben: Okay, so
over lunch somebody sent me this.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.300
Is it James?

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.278
Is that right?
Okay, so

5
00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:16.174
we're gonna talk about a different kind of
responsiveness here today this afternoon.

6
00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:28.046
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

7
00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:36.375
&gt;&gt; Ben: [LAUGH]

8
00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:37.712
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

9
00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:39.730
&gt;&gt; Ben: There you go.

10
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.951
[LAUGH] I have no idea why we're looking
at this, but I thought it was kinda funny.

11
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:46.900
And James shared it so,
[LAUGH] [COUGH] yeah, there you go, enjoy.

12
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.706
Okay, so before we jump into retrofitting,
couple things.

13
00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:54.610
I didn't get to talk to anybody
about having beers this evening.

14
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.610
Is there anybody who's actually
interested in doing this, or

15
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.530
am I gonna be drinking alone?

16
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.570
Okay, awesome, nice.

17
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.750
So, we got a handful.

18
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.050
I don't know where I am, so you guys
are gonna have to recommend a good place.

19
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.710
Hopefully it's not that far from here.

20
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.073
Someplace that we can get to quickly and
get back.

21
00:01:11.073 --> 00:01:12.477
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That would be,

22
00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:14.535
I'll tell you after.

23
00:01:14.535 --> 00:01:18.159
Well, Burger Jones.
&gt;&gt; Ben: Okay, so, if you're interested in

24
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.760
having some brew after this we can talk
shop a little bit or we can just drink.

25
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.464
That's fine, too.

26
00:01:22.464 --> 00:01:25.034
But just hang around
a little bit after and

27
00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:29.288
we'll figure out.
&gt;&gt; Ben: Okay.

28
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.402
&gt;&gt; Ben: So what dying questions do we have

29
00:01:35.402 --> 00:01:37.300
after our morning?

30
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.250
Anybody?

31
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.470
No questions at all.

32
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:43.720
I'm either a really good teacher or

33
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.865
you guys are really smart,
one of the two, right?

34
00:01:45.865 --> 00:01:49.720
[LAUGH] Okay, so let's talk
a little bit about retrofitting.

35
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.380
I believe that there are times in the life
of an organization when starting over

36
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.990
with their web presence
is a really good idea.

37
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.850
But I also think that there are times,

38
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.180
I also think that a lot of times
we kinda jump to that conclusion.

39
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.930
I think we're tempted by file new and
starting from scratch, and

40
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.390
not having to figure out
what's already going on.

41
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.810
But I would like to see us,
as a community,

42
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.830
start to kind of evolve our sights a bit
more than just redesign them all the time.

43
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.030
Now I say that as

44
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.070
my organization is embarking on
a complete rebuild of our site.

45
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.970
[LAUGH] So I mean, I get it.

46
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.780
Sometimes it's something
that you gotta do.

47
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.720
But not only is it something that we kinda
sometimes have to choose whether we start

48
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.790
over or not, but sometimes we're
in a scenario where we're asked by

49
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.160
a customer to do sort of the minimal that
we can do to get a better experience.

50
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.760
And so what I wanna do is,
somehow we've kind of gotten into a couple

51
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.780
projects here where we've been asked
to do some of those kinds of things.

52
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.860
So I have a little bit of experience
embarking down those kinds of paths.

53
00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.130
And I wanna share with you guys a little
bit about what I've learned there.

54
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.630
So quickly, what is a Retrofit?

55
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.130
Here's kind of how I wanna define it, just
for the sake of our conversation today.

56
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.750
Finding the fastest and lowest-risk
approach to creating a better experience

57
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.720
on an existing site for
users of any screen, okay?

58
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.180
Any screen size.

59
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.170
Now we're not necessarily talking
about a specific implementation.

60
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.928
So it may be that sometimes you're
allowed to rewrite the HTML.

61
00:03:26.928 --> 00:03:30.312
And that's, you're just sort of
retrofitting the back end essentially, and

62
00:03:30.312 --> 00:03:32.156
then you can redo everything on the front.

63
00:03:32.156 --> 00:03:37.120
It may be that you're not allowed to touch
the HTML, and you have to only write CSS.

64
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.910
And we've been put in
that position many times.

65
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.750
And there's some really, I mean there's,

66
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.828
you can imagine how challenging that could
be depending on how that markup looks.

67
00:03:45.828 --> 00:03:50.000
So I wanna walk you guys
through two different things.

68
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.640
We're gonna cover some techniques you
can use to try and do some retrofitting.

69
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.050
And we're also gonna talk
about something that,

70
00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.870
I refuse to talk about retrofitting
unless I get to also talk about how you

71
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.900
work with the client in
a retrofitting scenario, okay?

72
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.060
So you'll see why I
think that's important.

73
00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.160
I mentioned a little earlier this
morning this book by Kristofer Layon,

74
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.620
a really, really good book.

75
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.940
Nice short read, actually I think
I even have it with me here.

76
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:16.800
That's how good it is.

77
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.240
I carry it with me.

78
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.260
All right, this is really good.

79
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.220
If you wanna come up and
take a look, you're welcome to.

80
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.320
But it's just a lot of really
good information about

81
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.900
how to create a better experience for
users on small screens in particular.

82
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.530
But using these kinds of techniques
that we've talked about,

83
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.160
when you can't always start over.

84
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.520
Dealing with legacy sites.

85
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.660
So, a really good resource for
this kinda thing.

86
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.997
[COUGH] I also have another
repository that we could,

87
00:04:44.997 --> 00:04:48.185
if you're interested in looking at
some of these kinds of techniques,

88
00:04:48.185 --> 00:04:49.790
I have a separate one out on GitHub.

89
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.081
If you just go to github.com/BenCallahan
there's a rwd-retrofitting.

90
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.244
And a lot of these examples
are in there as well.

91
00:04:59.244 --> 00:05:01.970
And this'll be in the slides if you don't
wanna necessarily get into the code

92
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.550
for this part.
