[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:09.842
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So fluid foundation,
flexible content, media queries,

3
00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:14.744
these three things alone all happening
really in CSS let us do a ton of

4
00:00:14.744 --> 00:00:16.900
adjustment to a site, okay?

5
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.230
If you just use these three things,

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.120
you can actually get
a layout to work pretty well

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.280
if you're kind of smart about it, you can
get it to work pretty well across devices.

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.690
Now let's talk about some
other considerations though.

9
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.480
Because it's a lot more
than just the guy writing

10
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.800
the CSS that probably needs
to be involved in this.

11
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.740
We're gonna cover quickly, touch target
area, hover states, contrast and

12
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.340
readability.

13
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.880
So not always, but most of the time,

14
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.370
as the viewport width shifts down, okay,
the smaller I get the more likely it

15
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.910
probably is that I'm actually on a device
with a different interaction model, okay?

16
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.700
I'm no longer using on
my phone a mouse and

17
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.699
a pointer, which is incredibly accurate.

18
00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.690
/You know, we get we've gotten really good
at using those things to be very accurate

19
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.900
with our clicks and our interaction, but

20
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.280
I've got a big fat finger that I've got
to try and touch stuff with now, okay?

21
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.800
How many of you guys have been on a site
that's maybe it's a really cool responsive

22
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.640
site, but the nav is so tight I can
hardly, yeah, I can hardly touch the lid.

23
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.613
I mean that's so frustrating.

24
00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:23.399
You know ,and it's not that
hard to it to figure out.

25
00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.984
We can just add a little padding to those
links, put a little space between them.

26
00:01:26.984 --> 00:01:28.366
All that can be done in CSS.

27
00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:29.870
It's really not that hard.

28
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.950
Apple recommends in their
native iOS guidelines,

29
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.930
they talk about 44 by 44
pixels being the smallest

30
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.610
target area touch size that somebody
can reliably hit with a finger.

31
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.830
That's kinda big if you think about
it in terms of what a link generally

32
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:47.630
is on the web.

33
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.410
So we're talking about adding
some significant space around

34
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.430
around links to give people the ability
to actually use them effectively.

35
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.250
A lot of times I see this too.

36
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.760
I see people using margin on their anchors
to separate stuff, and if all they would

37
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.940
do is switch that to padding instead,
it's gonna increase the touch area.

38
00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.690
Padding is gonna add to the height or

39
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.740
to the width of that link, as opposed to
margin, which would put space around it.

40
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.255
So it's something as simple as
using padding instead of margin can

41
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:19.840
actually be incredibly helpful for
usability.

42
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.520
There's lots of other guidelines too on
those kinds of touch target areas from

43
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.580
different hardware manufacturers.

44
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.680
But that's kinda what Apple says.

45
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.700
Hover states, I mean, good grief.

46
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.940
I've seen this a lot where I'm playing
around with a site on a touch device, and

47
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.500
there's content hidden behind hovers.

48
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.670
Drives me nuts.

49
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.500
The devices, to be honest,
are getting a little bit better

50
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.580
at showing that content and
registering the first touch as a hover.

51
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.860
But man, it's still frustrating at times.

52
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.951
And we could use some feature detection
actually to really simplify this.

53
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.800
Modernizr, who's using Modernizr?

54
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.380
Really cool feature detection library,
JavaScript based.

55
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.450
You can build your own little production
bundle that only tech tests for

56
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.040
the features you need.

57
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.070
And what it'll do is add this.

58
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.750
It'll add a series of
classes to the HTML element.

59
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.640
And what they do is indicate whether
a feature is supported or not.

60
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.060
So now in CSS,
I could do something like this.

61
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.630
Apply standard styles to an anchor.

62
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.470
And then in cases where no touch,
in cases were to the user agent is

63
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.090
not a touch agent, generally we could sort
of expect that we're using a mouse and

64
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.780
a pointer or some other interaction model.

65
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.340
Then we could allow hovers.

66
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.380
So just simply hiding our
hovers behind a no touch class,

67
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.674
you know, really simple to do, and
could actually be very beneficial.

68
00:03:40.674 --> 00:03:43.770
I'm gonna show you guys one
quick example of what I think

69
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.020
is gonna be happening
a lot more in the future.

70
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.430
You guys saw the,

71
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.150
who saw the new microsoft.com
that launched not too long ago?

72
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.750
Some giggles in the audience,
what's that mean?

73
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.580
You guys don't go to
microsoft.com on a daily basis?

74
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.920
[COUGH] Well, believe it or not,
they actually did an incredible job.

75
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.500
Perivale and Austin did this.

76
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.560
Trent Walton and his crew,
Dave I mean this is amazing.

77
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.060
It's responsive.

78
00:04:14.397 --> 00:04:16.600
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: It's
actually a really nice site.

79
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.390
What's interesting about this and I had
just literally three weeks before this or

80
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.170
maybe a month before they launched,
I had said to one of our clients that we

81
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.870
are working on a big, a big kind of
complex nav and a responsive sys scenario.

82
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.850
I said I don't think we should
use hovers on your primary nav.

83
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.820
They were the previous version
of the site had a big, you know,

84
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.330
horizontal nav you could hover over these
things to get these mega drop downs.

85
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.790
I said I thought why don't we even on the
even on the desktop with them with a click

86
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.250
of a mouse interaction,
why don't we just make the user click

87
00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.780
products download security,
why don't we do that?

88
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.000
And so we did that.

89
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.370
And then Microsoft launched and
I was looking at the site and

90
00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.180
I just noticed this.

91
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.100
I love it.

92
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.400
They still got a little hover right, it's
hard to see, but the color of the link

93
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.580
changes when you hover, but I have to
click to get the Mega Drop Down here.

94
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.640
Okay, I think we're going to
start to see this a lot more,

95
00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.340
shifting away from hiding
that content behind a hover.

96
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.206
I mean, a click versus a hover here,
come on,

97
00:05:15.206 --> 00:05:19.040
like let's be real about how
much time we're talking about.

98
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.494
So I think this is great, and

99
00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:23.721
I think we're gonna start to see
a lot more of this kinda thing.

100
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:35.738
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: [COUGH] There's lots
of other things we could consider with

101
00:05:35.738 --> 00:05:39.345
feature detection as well here but
that's just one example.

102
00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:41.740
Contrast.

103
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.890
I don't see a lot of people walking down
the sidewalk with a laptop kind of like

104
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.580
this, right?

105
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.040
You will see that a lot.

106
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.630
Generally with a laptop,
you're sitting someplace.

107
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.500
It's kind of hard to use them standing or
maybe you're a standing desk, but

108
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.140
you're a bit more stationary.

109
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.190
Occasionally maybe you're on a train or
a subway or a bus or something.

110
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:02.830
So there are use cases but
especially in, you know, the more mobile

111
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.848
context of a phone, I see people walking
down the street all the time like this.

112
00:06:06.848 --> 00:06:13.370
You know, I think you know that the sun is
bright and it's shining on that display.

113
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.740
It's not a controlled environment.

114
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.559
We need to be thinking about
things like contrast, you know?

115
00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:23.410
And I see some of the coolest designs
out there are the ones where they

116
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.100
really are playing with just these
minute differences in contrast and

117
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.360
it looks great.

118
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.970
When I'm looking at it on my
cinema display in the office, but

119
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.330
man I can't even see it sometimes on
a phone, especially if I'm outside.

120
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.490
You need to try this stuff.

121
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.250
Take it outside,
take your site outside on a device.

122
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.780
Try it in bed when it's dark.

123
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.330
Let's be honest,

124
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.100
how many of you guys play with your phones
at night when you're laying in bed, right?

125
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.020
Who woke up with their alarm clock
on their phone this morning?

126
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.740
Okay, right next to you, right?

127
00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.170
I mean, these things are always with us.

128
00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.990
People are gonna try it and
take it with you.

129
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:57.590
Get out and
experiment a little bit with it.

130
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.050
Try it in other places.

131
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.970
And then readability,
a lot of times this drives me crazy.

132
00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.980
Small screens does not mean small type.

133
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:12.120
[LAUGH] Okay, have you seen people doing
this with their phones too, right?

134
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.270
Crammed it right up to their face because
they can't read the text, because somebody

135
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.890
thought as the screen gets smaller,
the type should get smaller too, but

136
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.850
we actually use them much comfortable
a comfortable place to use them is here.

137
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.160
You know, it's a different distance than
what we work with than what we might

138
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.120
use a laptop.

139
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.350
So when you think about those things,
just try it, you know?

140
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.680
It's not as easy to increase the font
size on a phone as it is on a browser.

141
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.480
I have to sort of pinch and
zoom, you know?

142
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:42.420
And then I've, if I've created a nice
responsive of site and I zoom in,

143
00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.640
I have to like, I have to typewriter it,
you know, to be able to read it.

144
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.300
So try to create type
sizes that are readable.

145
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.760
Those are just a handful of things.

146
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.440
There's a ton more that we could
talk about and will talk about.

147
00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.936
But this is a quick overview, responsive,

148
00:07:55.936 --> 00:07:58.900
just to kind of bring
everybody up to speed.

149
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.160
I think we should take
a quick five minute break.

150
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:03.260
I'm gonna grab a little bit more water,
and then we'll come back and

151
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.800
talk a little bit about process,
all right?

152
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.300
Excellent.
