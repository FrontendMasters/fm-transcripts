2
00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:06.735
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Little bit about testing.

3
00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:11.453
The big, the best advice I can give you
want testing is that you've got to use

4
00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:12.860
real devices.

5
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.760
There's all kinds of stuff I mean all day.

6
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.000
We've been looking at sites like Tate
changing the width of our browser, but

7
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that's not enough.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.460
All you can really test there is layout.

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.700
You know,
you can't test things like contrast.

10
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.450
You can't test things like performance.

11
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.770
I mean, there's so many other
things that are factors here and

12
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.590
we really need to start
testing on actual devices.

13
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.010
I would recommend,
this is just my personal thinking, but

14
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.760
I'd recommend that you use Web Kit for
your browser during development.

15
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.920
The reason I would recommend
that is because IOS and

16
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.020
Android are all sort of, the default
browsers are all webkit based browsers.

17
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.170
You're going to get a good portion of
the market share of a lot of those smaller

18
00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.840
screens, just by using the same
rendering engine on your local box.

19
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.300
So you should consider this at least.

20
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.590
And then we talked a little bit.

21
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.990
Marc was mentioning patterns.

22
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.560
You know build patterns build libraries
of the patterns the components that

23
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.190
you're designing.

24
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.210
This is going to help you in testing so
much because if you would rather sit and

25
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.390
kind of flip through every
page of a website or

26
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.440
every page of your app, you can do that,
but you can also get 80% of your testing

27
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.400
done if you just have a single page
that has all those components on it.

28
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.240
Get them loaded in, get them into
the same kinds of layouts, but let people

29
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.570
have a single page, or maybe a half
a dozen pages that have unique layouts but

30
00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.730
have those elements living kind of outside
of the functionality of your app but

31
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.560
just visually let them
live in a single page.

32
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.190
And we do a lot of work where we do,

33
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.350
we're basically a front end
consultancy occasionally.

34
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.630
We work with the backend development
shop and we have to deliver the HTML,

35
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.140
CSS JavaScript components to them.

36
00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.280
And when we do that we do
it in a pattern library so

37
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.000
that we can test somebody goes and makes
a change to something in the Cascade,

38
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.390
in CSS is affecting all kinds of other
things I can go back to that one page

39
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.810
see all those components and
make sure I didn't screw something up.

40
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.120
So this will save you a ton of time and

41
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.880
testing If you don't have
real devices go buy some.

42
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.700
They're really not that expensive.

43
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.910
You can find them used on Craigslist,
on eBay.

44
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.060
Used bookstores tend to carry
a lot of the used readers as well.

45
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.820
Get them for less than 100 bucks.

46
00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.010
I mean, to be honest with you, the price
on these things is being driven down.

47
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.110
We found a couple big organizations that
had a bunch of Blackberries they wanted

48
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.010
to get rid of them, they're buying
new versions, so we got old versions.

49
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.600
That's great.

50
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.500
Got to test on the old ones too.

51
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.220
If you really can't afford devices go to
the Verizon store, go to the AT&amp;T store.

52
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.060
You know there's a whole suite of devices
right there you can play around with.

53
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.060
I mean I'm guilty of doing this,
I've done it myself.

54
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.598
If you've got to test,
you've got to test, right?

55
00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:56.210
There's also been this sort of.

56
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.730
A lot of people sort of all over

57
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.320
big cities are starting to
kind of build labs together.

58
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.890
So maybe this actually would be a great
placemark for a device testing lab.

59
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.440
You know?
Get a handful of devices that are in one

60
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.190
space everybody knows.

61
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.790
In your community knows that those devices
exist and then you don't all have to buy

62
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.740
the same devices you can kind
of keep them in one place.

63
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.920
Do your testing in one place.

64
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.720
Any other ideas on testing or, yeah?

65
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So there's you go against
any kind of emulator or simulator?

66
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.480
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: I don't,
I'm not saying you shouldn't use them.

67
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.630
I'm just saying that.

68
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.630
Testing on an emulator is different
than testing on a device.

69
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.569
You know, they're not one 100% accurate.

70
00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.230
They do their best and
sometimes they're helpful, but

71
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.290
you need to test on a real device if
you wanna know what it's really like.

72
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.870
Cool.

73
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.660
Okay, consistency.

74
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.250
I talked a little bit about this earlier.

75
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.320
I really believe this is true,
familiarity breeds usability.

76
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.270
So if you can find a way to create
some consistency across resolutions.

77
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.770
That's gonna help your users
understand the usability of the site.

78
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.150
Don't do crazy stuff just because you can.

79
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.310
Some of that off canvas stuff
we looked at is really cool.

80
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.350
I think it has a lot of potential, but

81
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.610
I think it could also be
misused in a lot of ways.

82
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.010
So make sure it's something that
actually makes sense before you try and

83
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.430
implement it.

84
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.180
And users do resize their browser.

85
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.900
We talked about this already, but the idea
that they're viewing your site from lots

86
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.940
of different resolution devices on
different browsers in different contexts.

87
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:34.820
So, you know,

88
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.970
make sure that you're thinking
about cross resolution consistency.

89
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.110
I've done a bit more writing about that
here and we can have a beer later.

90
00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But
they don't resize after they visit.

91
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.810
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Well okay.

92
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.160
So when people say this I see
all these response people say

93
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.439
you know this is a developer behavior
your users aren't resizing your browser.

94
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.340
What they're implying is what they're
saying what they really mean to say is

95
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.880
that in a single visit they're not
going to all these sites and like I do.

96
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.210
Resizing the browser is the new increasing
the font size they're not changing their

97
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.780
browser width all the time but they view
your site from lots of different devices.

98
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.090
The same person you have an i Phone.

99
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.650
Do you have a tablet?

100
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.980
I mean.

101
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.350
You go to those same sites from
different resolution devices so

102
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.260
they are resizing their browser it's
just in a different way, make sense?

103
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.160
I'm just saying if we can create some
consistency in all of those experiences

104
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.660
the usability is gonna increase
familiarity breeding usability.

105
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.770
Experimentation.

106
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.470
We talked about this a bit previously too.

107
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:45.000
You know,
get into the browser as quick as you can.

108
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.440
I can't say this enough.

109
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.280
You know, we're trying to
shift as much of the process

110
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.770
into the browser as we can because that's
where, we're building sites, you know,

111
00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.700
we should be working in our medium.

112
00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.430
And the inspector is your friend.

113
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.830
You know we saw some of those
experimentations earlier.

114
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.000
Like, get in there and play around.

115
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.640
Those things are so powerful.

116
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.540
Those tools are incredibly powerful.

117
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.840
You need to understand
how those things work.

118
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.680
Okay, if we could, I'd like to
take just a really short break.

119
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.850
And then we'll come back and
wrap this all up, all right?
