[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:08.030
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Let's talk
about how to apply styles.

3
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.090
We looked at a couple different
ways that you can structure or

4
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.790
write your media queries.

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.100
But we didn't talk about actually getting
those media queries into an actual

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.760
document.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.236
And sort of some the default
behaviors that you can get

8
00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:25.835
supported on older browsers.

9
00:00:25.835 --> 00:00:30.312
So let's jump right in here, I'm gonna
show you guys a little bit of code.

10
00:00:30.312 --> 00:00:32.412
[COUGH] I just kinda
wanna walk through this,

11
00:00:32.412 --> 00:00:36.000
this is just like a standard index.html,
the head of a document.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.990
I'm missing probably a lot of things here,

13
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.810
I just wanted to show a couple key
elements so I've kinda put those in.

14
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.150
First things first,
if you gonna do a response of site,

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.850
you have to you have to use
this viewport meta tag.

16
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.720
Actually that should be meta,
not media, sorry about that [LAUGH].

17
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.190
But this is a meta tag that you'll see
in the top of every site that's actually

18
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.280
responding.

19
00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.870
What happens is,
all we're saying is that the viewport

20
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.450
that your report needs to be your
actual device width, and I want

21
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.720
you to start your scale out at one like
I don't want you to zoom in or zoom out.

22
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.910
When Steve was standing there,
with the iPhone first gen and

23
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.710
double tapping on those things,
the way I saw that and I was like,

24
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.970
how the heck did he get that
browser to shrink down?

25
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.290
Cuz at that point if you just
open up New York Times and

26
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.250
take your browser down it doesn't
fit in a 320 pixel browser window.

27
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.220
And this is actually what he did.

28
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.791
Apple introduced this okay this is not a
standard actually that's being considered.

29
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:43.180
And we're gonna take a look at another
standard that's actually gonna probably

30
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.040
replace this at some point but
yeah, what's up?

31
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that supposed to be-
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: It's supposed to be meta.

32
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.740
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.460
If you didn't hear me say it earlier, that
media should actually be, it's a meta tag,

34
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.840
it's not a media tag, it's not my bad.

35
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.470
If I had something like a t-shirt,
I'd give it to you right now, but sorry.

36
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.550
[LAUGH] Okay,

37
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.260
so what this is doing is it's telling
the device to report its actual width.

38
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.490
If you don't have this in
an iPhone is gonna report back

39
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.280
that it's a lot wider than it actually is,

40
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.760
which is how the site is kind of
compressed into a small viewport.

41
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.640
So just something like this simply

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.510
would allow you to kinda get
the site to actually respond.

43
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.050
And then it will fire appropriately based
on the media queries that you're using.

44
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.580
You can also do some other stuff
with this some evil things like

45
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.720
not allow your users to zoom, okay?

46
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.940
And there's for

47
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.740
a while an older versions of iOS there
was this orientation change bug where

48
00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.318
if you looked at a site and portrait
rotated to landscape in the rotated back.

49
00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:49.900
It would zoom you in a little bit and
you had to kind of like pinch.

50
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.530
I've got one of these devices you
probably are familiar with this.

51
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.940
And so one way to prevent that was to say,
don't zoom,

52
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.100
there's another parameter here.

53
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.590
You can specify, I don't recall what it
is, but you can say basically don't zoom,

54
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.140
don't allow them to pinch and
zoom on the site.

55
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.223
A lot of people implemented that
immediately because it fixed that

56
00:03:08.223 --> 00:03:11.759
orientation issue but it also is kind
of an accessibility problem, right?

57
00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:16.519
If somebody has very poor vision and
they want us to still be able to read your

58
00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.660
site they should be able to zoom in and
read it.

59
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.660
So you don't really wanna
prevent that kind of behavior.

60
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.200
Something like this in the head is gonna
be necessary if you're gonna get your

61
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.470
site to respond.

62
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.790
Questions on that meta tag?

63
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.580
Okay, so the next,

64
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:38.400
the rest of this section here is Is a way
that you might include your styles, okay?

65
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.310
There's a ton of people doing
this in a ton of different ways.

66
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.250
We do some some custom rails development,
as well.

67
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.220
And with rails comes the Sass
preprocessor, CSS preprocessor.

68
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.310
So basically, we're using Sass
on all of our projects now.

69
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.490
And there are some really cool things
you can do with this technology,but

70
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.970
you don't have to do any of that other
stuff you can take a standard CSS file,

71
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.500
change the extension to SCSS and
it is a valid Sass file, okay?

72
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.540
And if you just do that with it you can
get some of the benefits that we're gonna

73
00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.310
talk about here.

74
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.620
So what we're doing here is with no
media types, no media query at all.

75
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.320
Everybody loads this base CSS file, okay?

76
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.330
And I'm gonna show you what each
of these CSS files looks like.

77
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.985
And then our next line here,

78
00:04:29.985 --> 00:04:35.920
[COUGH] we're specifying this with
a media query of not print, okay?

79
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.860
There's a not keyword which you can use.

80
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.310
And what it does is according
to spec negate the entire query.

81
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.310
Okay, so
any media types as well as features.

82
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.460
So all I'm doing is,
kind of this is basically a way for

83
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.585
me to nest some media queries
because I'm saying I only

84
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:58.370
wanna apply these more complex layouts
when I'm not printing the page, okay?

85
00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.220
And this is a sort of [COUGH] this sort
of a simplified version of this line I'll

86
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.770
show you my site and
the head of my of bencallahan.com

87
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.320
we'll take a look at some more complex
list of media types you might use here.

88
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.730
And then we do a little conditional
comment here that says if.

89
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:17.120
So this was MQ.CSS, okay?

90
00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.050
So this is a file that has our
styles all in a single file but

91
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.470
all inside immediate queries.

92
00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.990
All the basic layout was
taken care of with base.

93
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.770
No media queries inside there.

94
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.040
Actually inside base I usually
put a print block at the bottom.

95
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.500
So this is what's loaded first,
linear layout and

96
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.270
then a little bit of stuff at the bottom.

97
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.560
Cuz that linear, that sort of simplistic
layout, is actually really good for

98
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.920
printing, right?

99
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.340
All we need to do is kind of hide our nav,
hide our videos,

100
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.570
audio those kinds of things
you might wanna get rid of.

101
00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.570
You might increase font size or
change your margins a bit.

102
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.530
But the base is a really good
starting point for printing as well.

103
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:58.540
And here we do everything that's a bit
more complex that we maybe wouldn't

104
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.500
necessarily wanna see multiple columns and
those kinds of things in a print scenario.

105
00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.670
So that's mq.css.

106
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.370
If I'm less than or equal to IE8, so

107
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.050
if I don't support media queries if I'm IE
that doesn't support media queries.

108
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:17.270
And I'm not IE mobile then I'm gonna
include this nomq.css for screen.

109
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.060
nomq is, believe it or not,

110
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.230
exactly the same as mq with all
the media queries stripped out, okay?

111
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.830
So you can imagine that if you
were trying to do this without

112
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.670
something like a CSS pre-processor,
you've got two files that are pretty much

113
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.160
identical with a couple of lines
different that you've got to maintain.

114
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.610
Nobody wants to do that.

115
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.878
This is why we use a pre-compiler,

116
00:06:38.878 --> 00:06:41.710
because we can,I'll show you
exactly what I'm talking about.

117
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.490
So what this does, is this ends up
building up a more complex layout

118
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.710
without the need for those media queries.

119
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.241
That all the styles are still applied but
these browsers that don't support

120
00:06:54.241 --> 00:06:58.152
those are gonna just load
the largest resolution layout, okay?

121
00:06:58.152 --> 00:07:00.008
Let's jump in quickly to
look at each of these.

122
00:07:00.008 --> 00:07:01.896
So yeah question at the back.

123
00:07:01.896 --> 00:07:05.792
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think you kinda
mentioned earlier so with your mq.css.

124
00:07:05.792 --> 00:07:07.312
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yeah.

125
00:07:07.312 --> 00:07:11.784
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The file is always gonna
be full even if the media query returns

126
00:07:11.784 --> 00:07:12.994
false, right?

127
00:07:12.994 --> 00:07:16.114
Like you'll still have the resource there,
it just won't be applied unless

128
00:07:16.114 --> 00:07:17.824
that media-
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Yep, absolutely, yeah.

129
00:07:17.824 --> 00:07:22.823
Yeah, so
this technique adds one request is

130
00:07:22.823 --> 00:07:27.468
kinda we used to do this
without this this split, okay?

131
00:07:27.468 --> 00:07:32.229
And I'm gonna talk to you a little bit
about why we've shifted to this model now.

132
00:07:32.229 --> 00:07:36.892
And there's some other things you can do
here to kind of limit those things, but

133
00:07:36.892 --> 00:07:41.275
you gonna just need to make a decision
based on the performance needs of your

134
00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:42.966
specific site, all right?

135
00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:45.830
Okay, so base.css.

136
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:47.970
So again we're looking at what's included.

137
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.540
This is loaded for
everybody regardless of user agent.
