00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.259
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.310
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Okay, let's jump back in.

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.460
Any questions as we jump into process
a little bit here before we get into this?

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.530
Okay, I want to quickly get an idea

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.260
of sort of what you guys actually
do on a day-to-day basis.

6
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.810
So how many project managers do we have,
one?

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.700
Okay, how many content strategy or
copywriters,

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.330
people who are in charge of
getting the content together?

9
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.240
No content people?

10
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.358
Okay, how many front end developers,
you write HTML, CSS, JavaScript?

11
00:00:39.358 --> 00:00:45.680
Okay, designers, UI kind of designers?

12
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.840
One designer, are you kidding me?

13
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.850
Wow, two designers.

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.230
Okay, how about user experience
kind of stuff like wire framing,

15
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.600
architecture, a couple of those?

16
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.220
Okay, a handful of those.

17
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.840
What about back end of, your in the on
the server, database, that kind of stuff?

18
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.690
Okay, project manager and back end dev?

19
00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I do everything.

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.750
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: You do it all.

21
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.510
You should be up here, man.

22
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.360
Awesome.

23
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.140
Okay, what did I forget?

24
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.270
That's it.

25
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.180
Okay, all right, so mostly front end devs.

26
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.770
It's funny, I think one of the reasons I

27
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.770
think that responsive web
design has become so popular so

28
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.450
quickly is because we put so much power in
the hands of a single role in our process.

29
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.600
You know, the front end
developer could make a decision,

30
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.870
whoever is writing the CSS, could make
a decision at any point in the time in

31
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.656
the process that they just wanted
to make the site responsive.

32
00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:52.650
And what I think that's resulted
in is a bunch of web sites

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.270
that are definitely responsive, but
that are actually not very usable.

34
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.807
And so what I think we need to
do is start to invite some other

35
00:02:01.807 --> 00:02:03.725
people into the conversation.

36
00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:07.801
I mean, we have completely changed
the way we build sites in the past

37
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:12.737
two years because we've just found that
taking these techniques that happened,

38
00:02:12.737 --> 00:02:16.168
primarily in CSS, and
just kind of cramming them into our

39
00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:19.623
existing process doesn't
really result in good stuff.

40
00:02:19.623 --> 00:02:24.115
[LAUGH] So let's talk a little bit about
process, and I don't want to spend a lot

41
00:02:24.115 --> 00:02:28.190
of time on this, but I think it's
really important for us to hear.

42
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.600
So let's start off with
a myth about process.

43
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.950
A lot of people out there
I think believe this.

44
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.900
Each client deliverable needs
to look more like a final

45
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.770
beautiful end product than
the previous one, right?

46
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.220
It's like you're on a journey.

47
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.250
You're taking a step with your clients.

48
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.128
They expect that each step that you
take should look more like that web site

49
00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:51.270
that they gonna get at the end of the day.

50
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.497
And when I say clients here, I don't
necessarily mean that you're necessarily

51
00:02:55.497 --> 00:02:57.362
always in a service organization,

52
00:02:57.362 --> 00:03:00.174
you may be internal at
a company working on a product.

53
00:03:00.174 --> 00:03:01.278
You still have clients,

54
00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:05.780
you still have somebody who's got to
approve the stuff that you're building.

55
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.140
So what does this result in?

56
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.710
Pushing towards nearly designed
wire frames quickly and

57
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.449
completely designed comps soon after,
okay?

58
00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:18.850
And I think that this kind
of gets us in trouble.

59
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.030
We've been actually creating throwaway
deliverables for a long time.

60
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.635
We've been making pictures of websites.

61
00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:29.530
[LAUGH] And
we should be making websites, right?

62
00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.570
I think we do those things to try and
convince our clients that

63
00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.690
they hired the right guy or that we're,
you know, good in our position.

64
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.020
So a better mindset that
we might start to consider.

65
00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.470
Deliverables that best
serve the organization and

66
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.460
prioritization of content in function
across multiple resolutions.

67
00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.974
If we can get this stuff down, then
we're gonna have a much better chance of

68
00:03:53.974 --> 00:03:56.994
creating a usable experience
at any resolution.

69
00:04:00.772 --> 00:04:03.400
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: So
the first Venn diagram of the day.

70
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.784
I'm sure that I've missed some skill
sets in these sort of outer circles,

71
00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.759
but the point here is this.

72
00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.791
We think a lot of times when people talk
to you about their process, they say well,

73
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.123
we start with a research, and
we do planning, and we do design, and

74
00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:20.310
then we do development.

75
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.930
And the problem with that is
they've taken planning, and

76
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.330
they've kinda just put it
up here at the beginning.

77
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.160
And then you're making all kinds of
decisions, the rest of the whole process.

78
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.880
Months of decisions are being made
based on this one little planning

79
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.020
session that you had.

80
00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.680
You know, or
maybe a couple days worth of planning.

81
00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.438
I think that's a bad idea, especially
in a case where we're building lots

82
00:04:40.438 --> 00:04:44.450
of different, essentially lots of
different designs from the same document.

83
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.950
So what we try to do is we try to

84
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.810
think about our process
in terms of deliverables.

85
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.060
And we try to make sure that planning
is included in all of them, okay?

86
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.610
And planning is something that should be
happening at every stage that you're,

87
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.410
that you're,
that you're progressing through.

88
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.270
It should cover all disciplines.

89
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.120
I'm sure that I've missed a few
disciplines here, but you get the idea.

90
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.990
So here is a rundown of the kinds
of deliverables that we

91
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.420
at Sparkbox,
that we actually have in our process.

92
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.990
We do research deliverables, okay?

93
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.410
We're talking about brand analysis,
competitive analysis,

94
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.300
requirements gathering, stakeholder
interviews, all these kinds of things.

95
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.410
We do that stuff.

96
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.180
We do a good investigation
of their current site.

97
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.390
You know, what's working,
what's not working.

98
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.510
We do content,
we have content deliverables.

99
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.530
We talk about content inventory,
gap analysis,

100
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.020
we do writing, those kinds of things.

101
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.100
We do priority deliverables.

102
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.239
So, we have things like
information architectures,

103
00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:47.961
wire frames, experience design,
experience mapping, those kinds of things.

104
00:05:47.961 --> 00:05:50.945
We have, and
when I talk about priority here,

105
00:05:50.945 --> 00:05:56.007
I'm not talking about just priority of
content, also priority of function.

106
00:05:56.007 --> 00:06:00.131
We have style deliverables obviously,
we do layout, topography, color, texture,

107
00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:01.424
all those kinds of things.

108
00:06:01.424 --> 00:06:05.678
And then functional deliverables,
templates, content manager system,

109
00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:10.270
database integration,
customizations to those things, okay?

110
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.600
And today I wanna focus on two of these,

111
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.410
priority deliverables and
style deliverables.

112
00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.420
Cuz I think that we've kind of been
handling all of this up to this point in

113
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.046
the functional deliverable section.

114
00:06:22.046 --> 00:06:25.270
So I wanna start to move some of
the thinking a little bit further back

115
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:26.030
in our process.

116
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:32.130
Okay, I'm gonna assume that you guys
are doing some sort of research,

117
00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.000
some sort of contents work, okay?

118
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.590
In fact, we spend probably

119
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.560
a significant portion of our
time on those first two things.

120
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.580
Cuz we just really think that it's gonna
create a better product in the end.

121
00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.240
So please don't hear me
as saying that we don't

122
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.820
really those things aren't important.

123
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.460
I just wanted to cover a couple
specifics today, and save some time for

124
00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:54.980
some more technical
stuff a little later on.
