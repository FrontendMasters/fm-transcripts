00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.262
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:06.329
&gt;&gt; Ben: So let's talk a little
bit about some techniques.

3
00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:09.931
I'm actually gonna jump right
into the browser here, so

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:17.209
we can start to experiment a bit.
&gt;&gt; Ben: So

5
00:00:17.209 --> 00:00:22.267
you guys are familiar with
the RWD Twitter handle.

6
00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:29.150
This is managed by Ethan Marcotte, who
coined the phrase, Responsive Web Design.

7
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.680
He's on Twitter as RWD,
where he talks almost endlessly about

8
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.280
awesome techniques that are coming out or
different sites that have been launched.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.490
So if you're on Twitter, and
you're not following this and

10
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.440
you're interested in Responsive,
you should check this out.

11
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.100
But what I would like to do today
is to actually play around with

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.210
this website a little bit.

13
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.044
So Twitter, you can kinda see
how the Twitter site works at

14
00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:57.394
a small resolution,
in a desktop browser, right?

15
00:00:57.394 --> 00:01:01.740
So it's actually kinda giving me this
scrolling left and right behavior.

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.191
So what I'd like to do is just get in
with the inspector a little bit and

17
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:04.884
play around here.

18
00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:09.660
So this is kind of a habit
that I have these days.

19
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.540
Over lunch a lot of times,
I'll bring my lunch in and

20
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.970
I'll sit at my computer while I eat and
just kind of find a site that I'm curious

21
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.510
about how it was built, open up
the inspector and start tearing it apart.

22
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.954
The tools we have today to do
this stuff are incredible.

23
00:01:24.954 --> 00:01:29.190
I mean the inspector, I'm in Chrome today,

24
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.910
whatever modern browser you're using
there are, these kind of tools exist.

25
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.020
So make sure that you're figuring
out how to use these things.

26
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.950
We're gonna really just look at
how to look at HTML and CSS today.

27
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.930
So we're gonna just have a very
simple approach to this.

28
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.972
But what I'd like to do is see if
I can get these columns kind of

29
00:01:44.972 --> 00:01:46.473
flexing a little bit, okay?

30
00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:53.270
So, I'm just hovering over stuff here in
the DOM, you can see this page outer div.

31
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.900
You guys able to see this okay?

32
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.071
It's a little bit small.
&gt;&gt; Ben: This page outer

33
00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:06.996
div is kinda got everything inside of it
and inside that is this page container.

34
00:02:06.996 --> 00:02:11.905
And you can kinda see there's some margin
on the outsides here and some padding for

35
00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:12.840
this element.

36
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.988
So, in this element
itself in the CSS here,

37
00:02:16.988 --> 00:02:20.924
has a width of 837 pixels, all right.

38
00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.966
So we're gonna need to remember that
number a little later for some context,

39
00:02:24.966 --> 00:02:25.661
but 837.

40
00:02:25.661 --> 00:02:29.337
So let's just set that to 100%, okay.

41
00:02:29.337 --> 00:02:32.032
So now, what's happened is,

42
00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:37.015
you can kinda see.
&gt;&gt; Ben: The site is

43
00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:40.020
actually sort of flexing
a little bit right?

44
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.502
But as soon as I get too small for

45
00:02:41.502 --> 00:02:45.448
those two fixed-width containers to live
on the same page, one pops down below.

46
00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:50.223
And you'll also notice, it's a little bit
hard to see here, but if I scroll left and

47
00:02:50.223 --> 00:02:54.527
right a little bit, you'll see that
that padding that was on that element,

48
00:02:54.527 --> 00:02:59.168
because we set it to 100% and padding
actually adds to the width, now the width

49
00:02:59.168 --> 00:03:03.510
of that container is actually greater
than the width of the browser itself.

50
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.213
Well, let's look and
see what the padding is itself.

51
00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:12.288
So 28, 14 pixels on either side.

52
00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:17.371
So, I wanna show you guys a really
quick rule that a little,

53
00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:23.694
some styling that will, this
completely changed my life, completely.

54
00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:31.924
[LAUGH] So,
&gt;&gt; Ben: box-sizing,

55
00:03:34.336 --> 00:03:35.270
&gt;&gt; Ben: border-box.

56
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.140
Who's used this before?

57
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.380
Yeah.
It's awesome isn't it?

58
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.960
Man, this is incredible.

59
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.911
Did you see what happened there?
As soon as I applied that style to that

60
00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:49.070
container, I'm not needing to
scroll left and right anymore.

61
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.810
What's happening is,

62
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.104
this rule basically says padding should
be included in the width that you define.

63
00:03:56.104 --> 00:03:59.470
That's kinda how we really
want it to work anyway, right?

64
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.640
How many of you guys would do this,
where you write,

65
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.490
you say something is 100 pixels wide and
it has 10 pixel padding.

66
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.737
And now it's 120 pixels wide, and I gotta
go make it 80 pixels wide because I had 10

67
00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:11.098
pixel padding, and
I really wanted it to be 100 pixels wide?

68
00:04:11.098 --> 00:04:13.500
That's frustrating.

69
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.300
Older versions of IE actually
worked like this but

70
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.340
this lets us do some really cool stuff
in Responsive as you can imagine.

71
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.874
So just that simple rule and

72
00:04:22.874 --> 00:04:26.084
there are browser prefixes
that you need to think about.

73
00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:29.471
Paul Irish has done a great
write up on how useful this is,

74
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:33.847
if you just go to his site paulirish.com
I think, or if you just search for

75
00:04:33.847 --> 00:04:36.950
box-sizing you'll find it as well.

76
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.290
He's done some performance testing.

77
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.930
He's actually recommending
that you apply that rule

78
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.370
to the star selector as
the first thing in your CSS.

79
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.102
That means apply it to every
single element in your DOM, okay?

80
00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:53.374
Now he's done some interesting performance
tests, or some of his colleagues have,

81
00:04:53.374 --> 00:04:57.051
to see what kind of impact that has,
but it's actually pretty minimal and

82
00:04:57.051 --> 00:04:58.617
gets you a lot of flexibility.

83
00:04:58.617 --> 00:05:02.490
This is especially helpful too,
on inputs in a form.

84
00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.506
If you tried to mess with laying
a form out in a responsive way,

85
00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:11.374
a lot of times what happens is you can't
really get the padding that you want

86
00:05:11.374 --> 00:05:16.318
around the text inside of the input to
work well, and so your percentages and

87
00:05:16.318 --> 00:05:20.340
all these things, it gets pretty tight,
usually on a form.

88
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.380
So using this technique, you can add
padding right inside that width and

89
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.310
get a really nice experience.

90
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.933
You also notice that this container
now has two different units of

91
00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:35.307
measure that are being
used to add to its width.

92
00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:40.277
So we set it to be 100% wide and
then there's also a padding of, I think,

93
00:05:40.277 --> 00:05:42.079
14 pixels is what we saw.

94
00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:45.000
Yeah, 14 pixels on the left and the right.

95
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.824
So we're combining percentages and
pixels and yet we're still able to get

96
00:05:48.824 --> 00:05:52.966
a consistent width and it's because those
pixels are now being counted inside.

97
00:05:52.966 --> 00:05:55.960
That rule would also apply to borders.

98
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.788
So if I had a 10 pixel border on this,

99
00:05:57.788 --> 00:06:00.311
that 10 pixels would
also be inside the 100%.

100
00:06:00.311 --> 00:06:04.539
Really, really helpful.
&gt;&gt; Ben: So now,

101
00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.179
you can see that as I adjust that space
on the right is still there and we've got

102
00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:12.270
a little bit of a better experience,
in terms of scrolling left to right.

103
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.610
Now let's take a look at
these two columns themselves.

104
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.830
Okay, so again,
right here they start to break down.

105
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.573
So, let's see.

106
00:06:21.573 --> 00:06:24.544
So inside page container here.

107
00:06:32.317 --> 00:06:37.270
&gt;&gt; Ben: Okay, dashboard seems to be
what's containing this left column.

108
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.800
See how it highlights there.

109
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.900
So let's take a look at
the rules associated with that.

110
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.260
Okay, width of 302 pixels.

111
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.143
Who's got a calculator handy?

112
00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:49.937
302 pixels here.

113
00:06:49.937 --> 00:06:55.107
Originally the width was 837 pixels,
I need somebody to do,

114
00:06:55.107 --> 00:07:00.400
302 divided by 837.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 36.08.

115
00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.480
&gt;&gt; Ben: 36.

116
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.270
So we'll just cut it off, 36%, okay.

117
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.359
We're gonna just round these and make
sure that our math kinda works out well.

118
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.250
And now let's watch how this
adjusts as I change the width here.

119
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.490
So now that column itself is adjusting,

120
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.815
when I get down to the place where it
actually meets, it kinda breaks down,

121
00:07:22.815 --> 00:07:26.590
[LAUGH] still, because that
other column is not adjusting.

122
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.950
But we also can see that those inputs
are still kind of fixed width, right?

123
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:38.195
So let's take a look at those.
&gt;&gt; Ben: You can see,

124
00:07:38.195 --> 00:07:39.547
they kinda stick out, right?

125
00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:41.820
If I get too small there.

126
00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.883
So let's take a look at
how those are working.

127
00:07:51.155 --> 00:07:52.979
&gt;&gt; Ben: So, let's see input.

128
00:07:52.979 --> 00:07:54.640
Okay, 264.

129
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.089
So, I just had this inside
of something that was 307.

130
00:07:58.089 --> 00:07:59.796
So I could do the math on that right?

131
00:07:59.796 --> 00:08:01.780
Or I can just kinda play around right,
I in the inspector.

132
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:05.672
I could say, I want this to be 80%.

133
00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:08.750
Okay, I want it to be a little higher.

134
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.740
As I bump this number up, you'll see
those guys get a little bit wider.

135
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.760
Okay, 94 looks reasonable.
&gt;&gt; Ben: We

136
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.800
could probably do the same
with the button there, right?

137
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:23.060
But you get the idea.

138
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.278
Okay, so
now those things are flexing inside,

139
00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:27.612
well maybe we should
get that button going?

140
00:08:27.612 --> 00:08:28.780
[LAUGH]

141
00:08:37.687 --> 00:08:38.363
&gt;&gt; Ben: Same kinda thing.

142
00:08:38.363 --> 00:08:40.580
94%.

143
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.541
Okay, so we can play with those
to get those working more but

144
00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:48.330
let's look at that next column.

145
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.602
Content main here, and
that's where I get that highlighted 522.

146
00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:57.738
522 divided by 837.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [COUGH]

147
00:08:57.738 --> 00:09:00.487
62%.

148
00:09:00.487 --> 00:09:01.374
&gt;&gt; Ben: 62.

149
00:09:06.118 --> 00:09:06.736
&gt;&gt; Ben: Okay.

150
00:09:06.736 --> 00:09:08.677
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH]

151
00:09:08.677 --> 00:09:09.680
&gt;&gt; Ben: Awesome.

152
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.550
So now as I start to adjust,

153
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:16.600
you'll see that the whole thing is
flexing, actually pretty darn well, right?

154
00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.330
So really just a handful of rules

155
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.058
on an existing site without
touching their markup.

156
00:09:23.058 --> 00:09:26.080
Now, Twitter has a pretty
reasonable markup, right?

157
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.353
But really, the point here is just is
you gotta get into the browser and

158
00:09:30.353 --> 00:09:33.205
you gotta start to play with these
things before you commit to doing them.

159
00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:36.830
[LAUGH] I've had some calls before where
somebody would say to me, hey I've

160
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.814
got this site, take a look at it, and we'd
be look and walking through it online.

161
00:09:40.814 --> 00:09:44.654
And they say, you can't touch the markup,
I'll give you one stylesheet,

162
00:09:44.654 --> 00:09:47.959
one link essentially, in the head
of the document is all you get.

163
00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:50.814
And I want this thing to
work great on a phone.

164
00:09:50.814 --> 00:09:55.090
And I'm looking at this thinking,
there's no way that I can do this.

165
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.300
But I've learned now to always say,
okay, give me 30 minutes.

166
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.891
I'll bill you for half of an hour, [LAUGH]
and let me play in the inspector for

167
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:04.502
a little bit.

168
00:10:04.502 --> 00:10:09.445
And usually what I find is that
I don't give CSS enough credit.

169
00:10:09.445 --> 00:10:13.573
[LAUGH] It's really sometimes kind
of incredible what you can do and so

170
00:10:13.573 --> 00:10:16.006
I wanna show you guys a couple examples.

171
00:10:16.006 --> 00:10:18.226
Let's let's do a quick review
of some of these things.

172
00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:19.860
Any questions on this or.

173
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.530
Obviously what the next step here would be
to start to add some media queries, right?

174
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.593
To get these columns to kind of
flow down at some point, but yeah.

175
00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:37.080
&gt;&gt; Ben: So Twitter.

176
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.060
We again use this rule,
target / context = result, right?

177
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.026
In our case, we had 302 pixels and 522.

178
00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:50.110
And we used that original width, that
original fixed width, to calculate these.

179
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.886
And we just got rid of this other stuff.

180
00:10:51.886 --> 00:10:58.900
Just, I mean in this case, 0.08%, that's
not gonna make a huge impact on this.

181
00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.940
Leave a percentage or two in between is
kind of what happens when you do that.

182
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.600
It works pretty well.

183
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.870
We also looked at that box-sizing rule,
okay.

184
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:12.950
And here's a link to that article by
Paul Irish that kinda details a lot

185
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:16.930
more information on to how to use this
cross browser and that kinda thing.

186
00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.450
But right away, you'll see there's
Firefox, the Mozilla prefix,

187
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.960
and a webkit prefix and
then the standard definition.

188
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.700
Again, that just includes the padding and

189
00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:33.780
the border inside the width declaration as
opposed to having those things add to it.

190
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.227
This rule is so simple,
is hugely helpful and responsive, so

191
00:11:38.227 --> 00:11:40.373
really take heed of that one.

192
00:11:40.373 --> 00:11:41.175
[COUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I have

193
00:11:41.175 --> 00:11:42.410
a question.
&gt;&gt; Ben: Yeah?

194
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Are those,

195
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.510
are the modern implementations in Firefox,
Safari,

196
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:51.940
and Chrome not obeying the non-prefixed?
&gt;&gt; Ben: Modern versions

197
00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:52.930
are now.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

198
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:55.442
But older versions maybe not.
&gt;&gt; Ben: Right, yeah.

199
00:11:55.442 --> 00:12:00.504
Yeah, and there is a way that
you can sort of make this work,

200
00:12:00.504 --> 00:12:03.150
sort of a hack for IE as well so.

201
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:09.870
So, that article has all those
details spelled out on it.

202
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.848
But really, this is something
that's pretty significant so.

203
00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:18.046
Okay, so that's a rough,
sort of retrofit of a layout.

204
00:12:18.046 --> 00:12:21.417
And you can imagine that adding a few
media queries, we could get that

205
00:12:21.417 --> 00:12:25.330
site Twitter to respond really easily,
actually that would not be hard at all.
