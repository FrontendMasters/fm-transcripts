[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.344
&gt;&gt; Ben Callahan: Okay,
this is actually a SAS file.

3
00:00:08.344 --> 00:00:13.374
It's an SAS aggregate file
that generates based on CSS.

4
00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:17.192
So the file itself would
be called base.css, okay?

5
00:00:17.192 --> 00:00:22.178
When my CSS preprocessor runs on
this file it generates base.css.

6
00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:26.743
So, what we're doing here is we're using
these imports are not CSS imports,

7
00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:28.209
these are SASS imports.

8
00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:33.443
Okay, this is just basically being
used to build up a single CSS file,

9
00:00:33.443 --> 00:00:35.940
and we call these SASS partials.

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.340
Okay, so these are like little
subsets of CSS that we wanna pull in.

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.640
You can see this viewport keyword
at the top, this is what I meant

12
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.710
when I said that meta tag previously that
meta viewport tag, Apple created that.

13
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.790
And I was I was speaking,

14
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.620
I was doing a workshop at a conference in
Atlanta a couple weeks back, Re-Mix South,

15
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.420
and there was Microsoft was one of
the sponsors and they had Surface there.

16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.170
So I was I was playing with it, you know,
and there's a, when you're using

17
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.290
IE on the surface there's this mode called
snap, snap view or snap mode I think.

18
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.556
And what you can do is take
your browser and kinda like,

19
00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:17.977
toss it off to the left and
it goes [SOUND].

20
00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:21.615
You know and it goes over to like 400,
or 300 pixels or something and

21
00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:24.270
it's like a position fix
thing that sits on the left.

22
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.380
It's like a frame, is really what it is,
and then you can use the operating system

23
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.820
over in the right side,
the right three-quarters of the device

24
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.460
while the browser that you
had open is sort of fixed.

25
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.650
So, I think it's like a multitasking
kind of implementation.

26
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.810
I was playing with my site on it.

27
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.290
And I tossed it over in the SnapView and

28
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.520
the site zoomed to out,
like it wasn't responsive.

29
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.130
Even though the viewpoint with it
shrunk way down and I was like what.

30
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.010
Okay, what's going on cuz it was
responsive fine when I rotated it it

31
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.090
did its thing it was working well in
the browser out side of the SnapView.

32
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.370
So I started doing a little
digging online and

33
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.960
I found Tim Cadillac who runs
the breaking development conferences.

34
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.060
He had just like the day before written
an article about this and what he found

35
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:20.250
was that Microsoft opted to not support
that meta tag in SnapView only.

36
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.720
And what they're doing is supporting what
the spec says they should be doing but

37
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.870
they're doing it with a browser
prefix at this point.

38
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.440
So like in the same way that
we have this media keyword

39
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.770
that we can use in our in line in our
style sheets to specify a media query.

40
00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.820
There's also a viewport keyword and
it lets you do the exact same thing but

41
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.590
in your CSS file as opposed to
in the head of the document.

42
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.140
So in order to get your website to
respond in SnapView on a Surface,

43
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.650
right now at least,
you also need to specify this.

44
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.060
And probably it will be smart for me to do
this without the browser prefix as well.

45
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.550
Make sense?

46
00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.910
So really all this first section is
doing is the exact same thing as

47
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.810
that meta tag was doing okay.

48
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.460
But the meat of this is happening here.

49
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.680
So again this is a SASS
import not a CSS import, so

50
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.950
we're not making requests
with these imports, okay.

51
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.360
I would import say a reset or

52
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.890
normalize whatever you use as a sort
of a starting point for your CSS.

53
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.370
And then I have a SASS
partial called smallest.

54
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.020
And I call it smallest because this is
sort of everything that's applied at that

55
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.200
initial layout, the simplest, the smallest
layout that I want to support.

56
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.140
And then I have a query block
this is a SASS media query, but

57
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.250
it generates the exact same
syntax as you would see in CSS.

58
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.850
And it's just basically what I said
before is that we might have might

59
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.800
wanna suggest do a little hiding
of a navigation and a video,

60
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.210
those kind of things for a print case.

61
00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:57.730
So what what I've done is built our basic
stylesheet that does sort of a linear or

62
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.670
sometimes linear, sometimes just whatever
the simplest layout is that you have.

63
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.700
And also I'm using this as
a print print stylesheet

64
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.020
with just a few little additional styles.

65
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.470
Does that make sense?

66
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.260
Okay, so let's take a look at
the next file so we looked at base.

67
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.700
Okay, that was what we just saw mq.css,

68
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.500
so remember that we're linking to
this only when it's not print.

69
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.469
Okay these styles are only gonna
be rendered when it's not print.

70
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:32.400
So here's mq.css, so again we're
using these this SASS include okay.

71
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.716
And we're going to build up this is the
SASS aggregate file which generates mq, so

72
00:04:37.716 --> 00:04:43.049
it would be mq.scss is what we're actually
looking at and it generates mq.css.

73
00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:47.074
And what if inside you
know min width 30m.scss,

74
00:04:47.074 --> 00:04:50.636
which is another SASS aggregate or
partial.

75
00:04:50.636 --> 00:04:54.874
If inside of this I defined you know
the width of an li or something that

76
00:04:54.874 --> 00:04:59.700
would this include would literally bring
those styles right into this file and

77
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.230
generate a single file called mq.css.

78
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.450
All the media queries
are right in line here.

79
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.230
So this is a single css file that
has blocks of media queries in it

80
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.530
when it's when it's generated, okay.

81
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.210
I'm using m based media queries,
we use those,

82
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.880
I'll show you guys why we do
that in a few minutes here.

83
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.780
And you can see that I'm doing
this sort of additive css.

84
00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.300
So base was included which gave us
smallest, the smallest layout and

85
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.260
now I've decided I need
to break it 30em's.

86
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.180
And as when the browser
viewport is 30em's or

87
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.560
greater I include this CSS file when
it's 60em's greater I include this.

88
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.550
Questions on this?

89
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.860
Okay so we've included base basic layouts.

90
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.815
In cases where we're not printing,

91
00:05:46.815 --> 00:05:50.358
we're including styles which give
us a bit more complex layouts.

92
00:05:50.358 --> 00:05:54.708
Okay and then when IE doesn't
support media queries,

93
00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:57.270
what are we going to do for them?

94
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.870
So here's a nomq, okay.

95
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:08.840
It's exactly the same as mq except that
there is no media queries inside of this.

96
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.720
So right now if IE were to load this,

97
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.440
old IEs is gonna load this, this is
not gonna render any of these styles

98
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.469
because it doesn't understand this rule,
this selector, okay, this media keyword.

99
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.100
min-width-30em's IE just doesn't get it,

100
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.670
it's going to just ignore
everything in there.

101
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:30.700
So if I just do this
without the media query for

102
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.090
older versions of IE,
I can build up a more complex layout

103
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.420
with the exact same styles
that I've already created.

104
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.250
So I write on my CSS, the actual meat
of what I'm doing in these partials.

105
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.190
And inside these partials
there's no media queries and

106
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:49.830
that's how we're able to serve a larger
resolution layout to older devices,

107
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.760
older user agents that don't
support media queries.

108
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.020
Does that make sense?

109
00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.290
And I know that's kind of a mouthful.

110
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:01.290
I want to I'm going to
jump out quickly here and

111
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:09.479
show you guys,
the actual styles in my site.
