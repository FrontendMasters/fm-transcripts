00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.230
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So the kind of baseline for

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.000
adding interactivity is to add hover
states to elements inside of your email.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.520
I usually just links or buttons of some
sort you want to add a hover state

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.690
somewhere or
how you would have on a website.

5
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.500
So this is great for

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.590
accessibility because it adds that
additional visual cue to let somebody

7
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.580
know that this is interactive you can take
some sort of action with this element.

8
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.870
These do have to be included in
the head of your document now.

9
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:33.550
So if any mail client does end up
stripping those embedded styles,

10
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.110
then that hover functionality won't
work for your subscribers and

11
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.120
it's pretty easy, you're just using
again that hover pseudo selector.

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.120
Similar to how you would on a website and
just adding that into the head of your

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.740
document to adjust any of the CSS
properties that you want.

14
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.050
So let's look at an example here.

15
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.940
Let's go over our code and
if we open up that single column hybrid,

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.110
I'm going to start using that email
from going to here on out and

17
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.340
we can see that we have our button that
we added in there from buttons.cm.

18
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.270
And then we have our link down
here in the footer of our email.

19
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.200
That's an unsubscribe link.

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.090
If we go over here you can see these hover
states, both of those are changing color.

21
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.330
Pretty simple stuff.

22
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.338
You're just going to be targeting
those different things for the button.

23
00:01:26.338 --> 00:01:30.090
We're going to add a class a button to
that link since we don't want to target

24
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.576
all links necessarily with this styles.

25
00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:36.600
We're just going to target that specific
button using the class of button and

26
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.610
then we go to our embedded CSS up here and
we're adjusting those styles.

27
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.600
So, just to make sure it's usually handy
to have some sort of default anchor

28
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.030
styling embedded in your CSS because
a lot of times you'll be working with,

29
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.440
they'll be coding a template for like a
wizard wig editor or something like that.

30
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.870
That you don't really have access to
the code that's injected into your email.

31
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.290
So if you have some universal settings for
links, even if somebody adds a link and

32
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.660
you can update that a tag specifically,
it'll still cover that link.

33
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.880
Which is nice but then we're just
starting the hover state of that and

34
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.080
changing the color of that.

35
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.730
Whatever that link happens to be, in this
case, it's changing from blue to red.

36
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.980
Similar to the button, all we have to
do for that VML based button which is

37
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.710
super nice if you wanna add
this kind of interactivity is

38
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.020
just target the background color and
update that background color.

39
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.280
If you're using something
like that padding approach,

40
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.520
well padding is pretty easy because you're
still relying on background colors but

41
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.770
if you're using the border or padding
plus border based approach, then this

42
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.550
CSS will be a little bit longer because
then you have to update each individual

43
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.580
border property with that updated color
that with whatever you happen to be using.

44
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.720
You can get a little bit
fancier with hover's stuff.

45
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.010
You can pop them the CSS.dash
animations.html example.

46
00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.730
And this is doing
a couple of other things.

47
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.260
You'll see some other animation
in here too when we open it up.

48
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.150
So, for this button,
we're raising it up here,

49
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.610
we're adding little it's hard
to see on the screen here.

50
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.250
By adding a box shadow beneath that
side to note some sort of depth to it so

51
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.130
similar what you'd see on websites but
it happens to work inside of an email.

52
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.350
It's the way we're doing that is
by again targeting that button and

53
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.680
then just adding a couple of different
properties to that hover state.

54
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.480
So, again we're updating the background
color but then we're using this CSS 3 box

55
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.150
shadow property which is super
handy setting those properties.

56
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.290
In this case, it's the I believe
it's the X axis off-set,

57
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.492
the Y axis off-set and
then the blur of it.

58
00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:46.880
So, It's going to go down a little bit and
then be blurred out to 24 pixels.

59
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.725
Then we're using GBA to set the capacity
of that so it's not super dark and I don't

60
00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:55.370
we're adjusting the height or the the
placement of that by using the transform

61
00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.310
property and then translating why so
that it shifts up 10 pixels.

62
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.380
You can ease all of that which is awesome
using this transition property set on

63
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.740
that the non hover state of that button.

64
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.620
So here we're saying we want to transition
all these properties over 0.2 seconds and

65
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.210
we're going to use this easing function
to make it look nice kind of eases and

66
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.010
eases out which is awesome.

67
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.259
And that'll give you that

68
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.350
nice little animation which is not super,
it's not necessary for

69
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.870
the functionality of the button but it is
one of those nice enhancements for people,

70
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.240
and kinda sets your email apart
from others inside of the inbox.

71
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.530
The nice thing about all this
interactivity is that if it's not

72
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.420
supported then it just falls back.

73
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.350
You don't have to worry about
overriding any styles or

74
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.790
anything like that for
where it's unsupported.

75
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.250
It'll just fall back to that default.

76
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.130
That simple hover state or
no hover if hover is not supported.
