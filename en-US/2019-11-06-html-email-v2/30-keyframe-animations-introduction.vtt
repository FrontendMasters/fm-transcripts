00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.108
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: The next step up
from that is going to be using keyframe

2
00:00:05.108 --> 00:00:09.672
animation, so
CSS animations inside of your email.

3
00:00:09.672 --> 00:00:15.431
So this is cool cuz you can do more
complex stuff using CSS animations.

4
00:00:15.431 --> 00:00:18.781
That keyframes property allows you
to set different waypoints for

5
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:21.124
when things should occur
in your animations.

6
00:00:21.124 --> 00:00:23.563
So you can create really complex stuff.

7
00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.983
We're gonna see a pretty simple example.

8
00:00:25.983 --> 00:00:30.185
And then you can pair this again with that
transition property to make everything

9
00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:33.783
kinda fade in and out, or
move around nicely and look really smooth.

10
00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:37.161
So if you're not familiar
with CSS keyframes,

11
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.881
there's a couple of things
you need to worry about.

12
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:45.122
The main thing driving this is
the @keyframes property inside of CSS.

13
00:00:45.122 --> 00:00:47.919
So this will go on
the head of your document.

14
00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:52.733
And it tells the rendering engine that
you're setting up this animation that you

15
00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.655
want to then call at some point.

16
00:00:54.655 --> 00:00:57.469
So the way this works is
you have your keyframes.

17
00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.407
And then you have your
animation name here, and

18
00:01:00.407 --> 00:01:04.231
that's what you're going to
call later on for your element.

19
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.363
In this case, it's called animation-name.

20
00:01:06.363 --> 00:01:09.562
And then, we have a class of whatever
the element is we're targeting and

21
00:01:09.562 --> 00:01:10.459
trying to animate.

22
00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:13.963
And we'll call that name down here
using this animation property.

23
00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:18.789
So inside of the keyframe's curly
braces you have different states

24
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:20.659
that you're setting up.

25
00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.514
So you can do something simple
like save from the state,

26
00:01:24.514 --> 00:01:27.395
from these properties to this end state.

27
00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:30.641
That can be anything from
the background color or

28
00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:34.134
the color of an element
through to the positioning.

29
00:01:34.134 --> 00:01:35.949
You can move things around the screen,

30
00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:39.036
you can do all kinds of crazy stuff
inside of keyframe animations.

31
00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.313
You could get more complex and

32
00:01:41.313 --> 00:01:47.155
have different steps by using
percentages inside of that, 0 to 100%.

33
00:01:47.155 --> 00:01:51.189
So if you want one thing to happen
in the first 20% of that animation,

34
00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.562
then you'd say 20% and
then set all of your properties.

35
00:01:54.562 --> 00:01:57.773
Then you could do 30%, 50%, 70%.

36
00:01:57.773 --> 00:02:00.872
So you can have this stepped
approach to your animations, and

37
00:02:00.872 --> 00:02:03.564
using that you can create
some pretty complex stuff.

38
00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:06.741
For our purposes,
we're just gonna have simple states.

39
00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:11.270
We're gonna have a faded out state, and
then a faded in state for our element so

40
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.994
there's this nice fading in animation for
our email campaign.

41
00:02:14.994 --> 00:02:18.632
So if you open it up and it looks cool, it
kinda draws your attention to the campaign

42
00:02:18.632 --> 00:02:20.925
but it's not overpowering or
anything like that.

43
00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:22.493
So we'll just use from and to.

44
00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:26.249
So you're going from one state,
the initial state, to another state,

45
00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.550
which is that end state.

46
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.650
And then for any element we want
to apply this animation to,

47
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.914
we use this animation CSS property
which takes a whole bunch of

48
00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:39.530
different rules in there,
different properties.

49
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.904
But the main ones we're looking at
are the duration of the animation itself,

50
00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:46.942
how many times we want
the animation to play through.

51
00:02:46.942 --> 00:02:48.758
And then calling the name
of the animation,

52
00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:50.930
that keyframe animation
that we originally set up.
