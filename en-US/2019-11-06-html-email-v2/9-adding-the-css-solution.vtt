WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.330
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So the main point is that
we have this container element, so

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.477
we have our dev.

3
00:00:05.477 --> 00:00:10.828
And what we generally wanna do is use
that to provide most of the styling for

4
00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:12.654
the content in that dev.

5
00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:16.921
So we're gonna open up the style
attribute and we'll set things like,

6
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:18.211
we can set the color.

7
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:21.980
I like using high contrast also,
see it's black,

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.585
it's default anyways,
but we can set it there.

9
00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:31.426
And then things like font family, font
size, so we'll add, make this sans-serif,

10
00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:36.227
I expect some of you will have questions
while using web fonts in email,

11
00:00:36.227 --> 00:00:38.568
which we can definitely dig into.

12
00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:42.958
There's definitely a few
gotchas about doing it, but

13
00:00:42.958 --> 00:00:47.837
we'll make sure our text is big enough so
people can read it.

14
00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:52.806
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Good thing is to keep in
mind that we wanna have a generous line

15
00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:56.434
height, just so people can read
things a little bit more clearly.

16
00:00:56.434 --> 00:00:59.330
We don't want it to get too big and
make it hard to read, but

17
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.816
especially in email when so
much relies on links,

18
00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:05.867
you're trying to get people out of your
email and take some sort of other action.

19
00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.649
If you have those text links and
a block of copy,

20
00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.757
you can create those link clusters and
really closely packed links and

21
00:01:12.757 --> 00:01:16.598
people will try to tap and
they'll go where they don't wanna go.

22
00:01:16.598 --> 00:01:21.059
So line height's probably the best way to
make sure you have enough breathing space

23
00:01:21.059 --> 00:01:23.490
for all those links and
those blocks of copy.

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.000
So here we don't want to
use again pixel units and

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.930
set of relative units like just that
1.4 use ems or something like that.

26
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.439
Just cuz a lot of email clients don't
they haven't been updated a long time, so

27
00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.361
they might not recognize or
know how to render those relative units.

28
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:47.825
So for the most part, all of our units and
our emails are gonna be pixel sizing,

29
00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:49.460
which is a little bit weird.

30
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.046
There's formulas for

31
00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:56.314
kind of converting those relative till
you fixed units if you need them by.

32
00:01:56.314 --> 00:02:00.290
I usually just give it plenty of space
maybe double whatever that pixel size

33
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.446
happens to be or a little less than that.

34
00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:06.764
When you start doing things like headings
like longer lines of heading then

35
00:02:06.764 --> 00:02:09.503
you might want to shrink
that down a little bit so

36
00:02:09.503 --> 00:02:13.153
that the text sits a little bit closer and
it's easier to read.

37
00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:17.478
Yeah, so let's look at that and
see, let's look like here.

38
00:02:17.478 --> 00:02:21.758
So better,
we don't have that outdated like,

39
00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:26.252
Times New Roman style,
Serif that nobody likes,

40
00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:30.545
pretty much outside of
print books these days.

41
00:02:30.545 --> 00:02:31.803
Yeah, nothing too fancy,

42
00:02:31.803 --> 00:02:34.984
we can see that we haven't really
done anything to the heading here.

43
00:02:34.984 --> 00:02:38.903
So we get this default styling,
which is just bold,

44
00:02:38.903 --> 00:02:44.440
a little bit bigger than our normal
tech size, but we can update that too.

45
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.197
So we have our default universal styles
as display whole set to any of that

46
00:02:48.197 --> 00:02:49.189
content in there.

47
00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.333
When it comes to black level elements,
the main thing we're gonna be doing is

48
00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:56.920
overriding any of those margins or
the padding on those elements.

49
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.295
So, for headings especially we wanna
make sure that we control those margins,

50
00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:06.562
we don't leave it to the browser or
the email client to do that.

51
00:03:06.562 --> 00:03:09.830
So I usually zero this out
to start out with, and

52
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.686
then introduce more padding or
more margins as needed.

53
00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:18.384
The same thing applies for paragraphs so
we can add a style in there,

54
00:03:18.384 --> 00:03:21.021
I add this margin set up 0 for now, and

55
00:03:21.021 --> 00:03:25.818
this becomes especially important
as we start to add up more copies.

56
00:03:25.818 --> 00:03:29.408
So let's copy that and
another paragraph down here,

57
00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:33.493
and you can see we don't really
have any space between that.

58
00:03:33.493 --> 00:03:36.030
So that's where we start
using those inline

59
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.809
styles to add that additional space,
but we wanna control that.

60
00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:44.473
We don't wanna leave it up to the browser
or the email client to set that for us.

61
00:03:44.473 --> 00:03:49.825
So for the heading, let's add a little
bit of space on the top and bottom.

62
00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:53.538
Let's say, since having all
maybe add 40 pixels and 0,

63
00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:58.152
you can use shorthand, most email
clients will respect that shorthand.

64
00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:03.280
You don't have to declare margin top,
margin bottom, margin left, margin right.

65
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.884
Unless you want different settings for
those elements or for that spacing.

66
00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:11.772
So plenty of space around the heading and
then for

67
00:04:11.772 --> 00:04:15.154
the most part, for
paragraphs as I start training them,

68
00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:19.395
I just add the margin to the bottom
of that paragraph instead of the top.

69
00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:21.279
It'll just help keep things nice and

70
00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.959
consistent as we start
adding more content in here.

71
00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:27.347
So we can do, it goes top right,
bottom, left for

72
00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:29.952
that shorthand property for margin.

73
00:04:29.952 --> 00:04:33.284
So we can do 0 for top, 0 for right, but

74
00:04:33.284 --> 00:04:38.386
maybe add 20 pixels on the bottom,
and then 0 for the left.

75
00:04:38.386 --> 00:04:42.996
So when I just copy that style down here,
then we have a little bit of space,

76
00:04:42.996 --> 00:04:46.810
we have plenty of line height
maybe even a little bit too much.

77
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.917
We're gonna take that down some,
so like 28.

78
00:04:52.674 --> 00:04:55.031
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: That's a little bit better,
a little bit more comfortable.

79
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:59.248
Obviously, we aren't doing
anything structural to the email,

80
00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:03.247
but we can see how that might
work with our container div here.

81
00:05:03.247 --> 00:05:07.415
So, all these styles control
the text in our email,

82
00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:12.246
but if we want to start structuring
things a little bit more,

83
00:05:12.246 --> 00:05:16.339
we can get started by using
the max width property.

84
00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:19.023
This doesn't we're again,
not using tables yet,

85
00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:21.953
we'll see how that comes into
play a little bit later on.

86
00:05:21.953 --> 00:05:26.339
But this is kinda part of the basis of the
hybrid coding approach which will look at,

87
00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.042
but max width is super helpful.

88
00:05:28.042 --> 00:05:32.098
We can make a something like 600 pixels,
that'll constrain it, and

89
00:05:32.098 --> 00:05:36.483
we can see that our image is still blowing
out of that container because it's so

90
00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:38.825
large, we're using this retina image.

91
00:05:38.825 --> 00:05:43.712
But we'll look at how to constrain that
when we need to start digging more into

92
00:05:43.712 --> 00:05:45.076
images themselves.

93
00:05:45.076 --> 00:05:49.572
Similar on the web right now we're gonna
use margins to center that content.

94
00:05:49.572 --> 00:05:53.127
So we'll do the old 0 auto trick, and

95
00:05:53.127 --> 00:05:58.143
then we're centering that content,
which is cool.

96
00:05:58.143 --> 00:06:01.084
One thing I wanna do is resize this logo,
so

97
00:06:01.084 --> 00:06:06.013
if that was my logo, it'd be gigantic and
I don't want that to happen.

98
00:06:06.013 --> 00:06:10.570
So I'm gonna had a width
attribute here and

99
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.756
set it to say, let's say 60 pixels.

100
00:06:14.756 --> 00:06:20.027
See what that was, so that's a little
bit better, I wanna style that a little

101
00:06:20.027 --> 00:06:26.580
bit too on the add a border radius
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: To make it circular so

102
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.317
I'll just set it to whatever that
width happens to be, that's cool.

103
00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:35.283
So one thing to note, though,
is that as you start using a little

104
00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:39.485
bit more advanced CSS,
like things that were introduced in CSS 3.

105
00:06:39.485 --> 00:06:44.804
Things like border radius, this isn't
supported across all email clients.

106
00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:49.079
And when we start getting into
things like centering these images,

107
00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:51.862
that doesn't work across clients as well.

108
00:06:51.862 --> 00:06:56.266
So let's center, let's again
let's say call us display black,

109
00:06:59.034 --> 00:07:01.179
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Margin 0 auto.

110
00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:04.466
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So
we're centering that in the email,

111
00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:06.694
I think I'm going to center
the heading as well.

112
00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:13.368
So again, we can receives text
align center on our hr heading tag.

113
00:07:13.368 --> 00:07:18.223
That's not something we wanna set at
this universal kinda container level,

114
00:07:18.223 --> 00:07:22.119
because we don't want all this
copy down here to be centered.

115
00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:25.242
That definitely has very big
accessibility implications,

116
00:07:25.242 --> 00:07:29.416
which we'll look at in a minute, but
we'll just set that on the heading itself.

117
00:07:29.416 --> 00:07:32.306
So we have that centered
heading looks nice,

118
00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:34.826
we have the body of the email down here.

119
00:07:34.826 --> 00:07:39.651
If we want to style that footer text
a little bit differently a common

120
00:07:39.651 --> 00:07:44.066
practice is to make it a little
bit smaller than the main copy.

121
00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:49.679
And then make it lighter colored, so
instead of black we could make it gray.

122
00:07:49.679 --> 00:07:54.060
And then maybe make it 14 or 16 pixels,

123
00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:58.937
decrease the line height
a little bit to match.

124
00:08:00.077 --> 00:08:02.837
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: And you can see that
we have this footer copy down here,

125
00:08:02.837 --> 00:08:04.525
that's a little bit different.

126
00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:09.695
We can add in here a little bit
more spacing to our email or

127
00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:14.645
to this footer section, so
we'll use margin again.

128
00:08:14.645 --> 00:08:20.851
Let's say, 60 pixels up top,
and a little space below, and

129
00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:28.125
then down below too we can add a little
bit extra space on the bottom there.

130
00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:37.289
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So now we have a little
bit of spacing between our footer and

131
00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:40.223
the rest of our content
which will help separate it.

132
00:08:40.223 --> 00:08:44.292
But pretty basic stuff,
we're just using those tried and

133
00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:46.711
true well tested CSS properties.

134
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:50.764
We're adding a little bit of structure
using this max width and the margin,

135
00:08:50.764 --> 00:08:54.691
we don't need that since that's
contained in this overarching div, and

136
00:08:54.691 --> 00:08:57.058
just making things look
a little bit nicer.

137
00:08:57.058 --> 00:09:01.752
And so let's see what something like this
actually looks like when we look at it in

138
00:09:01.752 --> 00:09:02.658
real clients.

139
00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:05.478
So this is again using
that limits extension,

140
00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:09.181
which will load depending on
the speed of the Internet here.

141
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:12.069
Load our email and
all these different email clients,

142
00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:14.913
right now I'm just testing
in 35 popular clients.

143
00:09:14.913 --> 00:09:18.365
Right now we have 87 available,
it's usually closer to 100 but

144
00:09:18.365 --> 00:09:20.448
sometimes some of the machines are down or

145
00:09:20.448 --> 00:09:23.620
we have issues with some of
the clients who will pull them down.

146
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.166
So you can see a couple of things here for
things like Apple mail

147
00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:34.936
works there which has like really
good support for HTML and CSS.

148
00:09:34.936 --> 00:09:36.949
You can see that all of this works,

149
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:41.614
our images are still blowing out here
we'll make that a responsive in a minute.

150
00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:47.094
By all this copy works our images has that
border radius applied and it is centered.

151
00:09:47.094 --> 00:09:49.200
But when we get into things like Outlook,

152
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.375
you can see that a lot
of that does not work.

153
00:09:51.375 --> 00:09:53.497
The border radius doesn't work,

154
00:09:53.497 --> 00:09:58.412
centering that image by making it block
level and using margins doesn't work.

155
00:09:58.412 --> 00:10:01.451
And then that max with doesn't work,
which is a huge issue for

156
00:10:01.451 --> 00:10:04.681
us because we do have a lot of
people still using Outlook clients.

157
00:10:04.681 --> 00:10:08.909
So that's where things like tables or
hybrid coding will come into place to

158
00:10:08.909 --> 00:10:12.280
provide better,
more robust structure for those emails.

159
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.767
And just kind of flip through and
see how it renders again,

160
00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:19.525
the Outlooks are not pretty at all.

161
00:10:19.525 --> 00:10:24.327
But when we get into things like Outlook
2019, which happens beyond Mac that

162
00:10:24.327 --> 00:10:29.143
uses WebKit again as a rendering engine,
which is awesome it works really well.

163
00:10:29.143 --> 00:10:34.341
The Apple models are awesome, old versions
of Android are actually really good,

164
00:10:34.341 --> 00:10:36.314
newer versions, not so much.

165
00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:40.300
The Gmail app depending on how
you're using it tends to be

166
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.717
a pretty solid rendering engine.

167
00:10:42.717 --> 00:10:47.512
Surprisingly there's a lot of different
versions of Gmail out in the wild.

168
00:10:47.512 --> 00:10:51.377
So there's a great article by
a guy named Remy Parmentier,

169
00:10:51.377 --> 00:10:53.551
who is a French email developer.

170
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.772
And he mapped out all
the different versions of Gmails.

171
00:10:56.772 --> 00:11:01.736
So there's not just like consumer Gmail
but there's G Suite, there's Google Apps,

172
00:11:01.736 --> 00:11:05.340
there's whether or not you're
using it in the app or via iMAP,

173
00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.597
it does different things to your code.

174
00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:12.425
So it's definitely something to dig a
little bit into and try to understand, but

175
00:11:12.425 --> 00:11:15.268
for the most part the Gmail
app is pretty solid.

176
00:11:15.268 --> 00:11:17.492
You get into the iMAP rendering,

177
00:11:17.492 --> 00:11:21.946
sometimes you run into some issues there,
the Outlooks are good.

178
00:11:21.946 --> 00:11:26.531
Samsung as its entire own world has a lot
of different problems with the e-mail

179
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:31.550
rendering so it's usually pretty tricky to
get things working well in Samsung mail.

180
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:36.002
But we'll look at using tables and
hybrid coding to account for

181
00:11:36.002 --> 00:11:37.770
some of those problems.

182
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.075
Gmail Outlook, but
it's nice you can go through and

183
00:11:41.075 --> 00:11:45.824
see exactly how your email renders
across these different email clients.

184
00:11:45.824 --> 00:11:50.194
So, a nice trick to account for
things like for

185
00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:55.012
centering in Outlook is to
rely on a good old tag that

186
00:11:55.012 --> 00:11:58.612
nobody uses anymore which is center.

187
00:11:58.612 --> 00:12:02.057
So this is completely deprecating, but

188
00:12:02.057 --> 00:12:07.642
we can use it in the context of
email to make that work and outlook.

189
00:12:07.642 --> 00:12:11.906
So if we say that we
can rerun the messier,

190
00:12:18.017 --> 00:12:19.583
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Hopefully Outlook pop

191
00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:20.243
up soon.

192
00:12:23.562 --> 00:12:25.881
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So
you can see we do get that centering, so

193
00:12:25.881 --> 00:12:29.660
depending on what you need to do,
that's really common for logos,

194
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.469
different images like icons and
stuff like that.

195
00:12:32.469 --> 00:12:37.433
You can use that dedicated HTML, it's
pretty commonplace in email development

196
00:12:37.433 --> 00:12:41.596
to make Outlook handle some of
our styling a little bit better.

197
00:12:41.596 --> 00:12:43.497
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We did
have a question in chat.

198
00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:45.080
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What about borders,

199
00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.631
should it be used or
not on block level elements?

200
00:12:47.631 --> 00:12:51.579
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So borders you totally
can use it's pretty reliable, so

201
00:12:51.579 --> 00:12:54.218
the way you do that is just using that.

202
00:12:54.218 --> 00:12:58.782
Border shorthand so say, width UR,
what type of border that is whether

203
00:12:58.782 --> 00:13:03.206
it's solid dash dotted, whatever and
then the color of the border.

204
00:13:03.206 --> 00:13:07.342
Padding again is pretty well supported
across block level elements.

205
00:13:07.342 --> 00:13:11.231
So those are used together a lot
of times to create like buttons or

206
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:15.767
like a grid type element or like a card
type element you'll have that border

207
00:13:15.767 --> 00:13:18.739
around there with padding
around that element.

208
00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:23.374
So yeah, go for border works well,
and usually combine that with padding

209
00:13:23.374 --> 00:13:26.837
to get cool effects like
buttons which we'll look at.
