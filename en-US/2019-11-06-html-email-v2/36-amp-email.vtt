00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: There's this
thing called Amp Free Email.

2
00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:05.780
So is everybody familiar
with AMP just as a project?

3
00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.790
It's called Accelerated Mobile Pages.

4
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.260
So it's a project that
was developed by Google,

5
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.960
in theory to provide a better
experience on mobile devices.

6
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.796
Whether or not it accomplishes that goal,

7
00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:20.645
I see some shaking heads
on your side here.

8
00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:25.326
But in theory, what it does is strips
out a lot of the JavaScript or

9
00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:29.601
the assets, things that
are a heavy payload for browsers.

10
00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:33.950
And makes a simplified version
of content on mobile devices.

11
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.508
There's a lot of debate about whether or
not it's a good thing to do.

12
00:00:38.508 --> 00:00:42.771
It's interesting because Google's kinda
using it to drive search results, and

13
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:45.660
work with advertisers and
publishers to drive that.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.480
So they definitely have business reasons
why they're pushing something like this.

15
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.150
But in the email world, last year they
announced this idea of AMP for email.

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.162
And so it's not so much about providing
a lighter weight mobile experience for

17
00:00:58.162 --> 00:00:59.500
email campaigns.

18
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.240
It's more about adding
interactivity into the inbox.

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.330
So the best way to show this
off is really going in.

20
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.170
I don't have a hand coded version but
they have a good playground.

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.262
And there's a reason why I haven't devoted
a lot of time into hand coding my own

22
00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:15.695
versions of AMP for Email.

23
00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:19.170
But let's look at what
something like this looks like.

24
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.547
So if we go over to here,
you can see they have really good

25
00:01:23.547 --> 00:01:28.498
documentation around AMP for
email, and just AMP in general.

26
00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:34.963
So the developers.google.com/gmail
has some good Gmail documentation.

27
00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:40.350
But then they have this entire
website about AMP called amp.dev.

28
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.850
So you can go into the documentation,
the different tools,

29
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.120
look at where it's supported, different
tools for creating AMP based emails.

30
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.520
Right now the only tool that
really supports like a drag and

31
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.440
drop WYSIWYG experience is Stripo,
which is interesting.

32
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.550
But then you can see it's one of the main
things, one of the problems with AMP for

33
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.920
Email is that there's not
wide adoption for it, yet.

34
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.080
And that largely depend on how this works.

35
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.682
So you can see only a couple
of different ESPs or

36
00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:11.490
services support sending AMP for Email.

37
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.886
And that's because you're
essentially sending a third

38
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.457
version of your email campaign.

39
00:02:18.457 --> 00:02:21.987
So any HTML email you send,
you're sending the HTML version.

40
00:02:21.987 --> 00:02:25.380
And then you're sending a plain
text version of that email as well.

41
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.660
And those are sent using those MIME types.

42
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.621
So it's this little package that's
delivered with your e-mail.

43
00:02:30.621 --> 00:02:34.993
So depending on the user's preference
if they want to see that HTML e-mail,

44
00:02:34.993 --> 00:02:38.712
it'll load that HTML e-mail,
that MIME type, and display it.

45
00:02:38.712 --> 00:02:41.387
If they have it set up so
they prefer plain text e-mails,

46
00:02:41.387 --> 00:02:44.590
it'll fall back to that plain
text version of your email.

47
00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.030
So AMP for Email is creating this
third MIME type, this AMP MIME type.

48
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.970
So anytime you wanna send one,

49
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.700
you have to use a tool that is set
up to send that third MIME type.

50
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.350
And right now only a few of them are.

51
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.050
The other thing is that not many
email clients support this.

52
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.930
So it's not even available across all
of Gmail, there's different versions.

53
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.481
So Gmail doesn't fully support displaying
these AMP versions of their emails.

54
00:03:12.481 --> 00:03:16.820
Right now, Outlook.com is testing
out support for AMP for Email.

55
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.640
I think Yahoo or
AOL maybe as they say on here.

56
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.100
Another web browser is testing
out support for AMP for Emails.

57
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.300
But there's not a ton of support for
actually displaying this stuff.

58
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.180
And on top of that,

59
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.740
the third thing kind of setting us all
back is, which is actually a good thing,

60
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.000
is it requires more serious security for
sending, for you as a sender.

61
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.750
So you have to have DCAM and
an SPF and DMARC.

62
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.203
All these different security settings
set up on your sending server that

63
00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:52.891
Google can then validate.

64
00:03:52.891 --> 00:03:55.912
And make sure you're a trusted center
before you start sending these

65
00:03:55.912 --> 00:03:57.240
interactive emails.

66
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.360
But once you do that, and
once support gets better, you could,

67
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.970
in theory, do some really advanced
interactive stuff that you couldn't do

68
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.230
using just a check box hack
without a lot of work.

69
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.870
Just using this abstracted
away version of HTML.

70
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.800
So here this is kind of their
boilerplate hello world type email.

71
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.840
You can see we have a little
content switcher down here.

72
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.880
And the way that's working is by using
this proprietary markup language for AMP.

73
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.460
So instead of HTML, you can see
this amp-carousel and amp-image.

74
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.060
So it's really easy to build out
these interactive experiences.

75
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.990
But right now,
nobody really supports that.

76
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.739
Which kind of sucks,
I mean, it's good and bad.

77
00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:44.495
I would argue that relying on standard
HTML and CSS to achieve this stuff is

78
00:04:44.495 --> 00:04:49.958
a better route than using something that's
almost entirely controlled by Google.

79
00:04:49.958 --> 00:04:50.480
It is for

80
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.413
all intents and purposes, proprietary
to them to achieve some of this stuff.

81
00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:59.623
But you can do some really cool stuff,
you can do text binding,

82
00:04:59.623 --> 00:05:03.834
which will allow you to create
these more interactive forms and

83
00:05:03.834 --> 00:05:09.750
send those forms back to a server a lot
easier than you could using HTML and CSS.

84
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.410
They have a full form that you could
fill out to get subscriber feedback.

85
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.130
They have different examples for
animation, an image lightbox,

86
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.320
which is kind of interesting.

87
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.720
So it's this really cool idea for
adding all this interactivity, but

88
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.110
the thing to note is that
there's not wide support for it.

89
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.720
And I don't expect as somebody
that's been in the industry for

90
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.540
the better part of a decade.

91
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.290
Based on experiments
like these with Gmail and

92
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.630
other providers, I don't expect there
to be wide support for it anytime soon.

93
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.639
There are some examples of this out in the
wild that they've done kinda a proof of

94
00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.331
concept, Pinterest is using it.

95
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:51.437
Booking.com I think is using it.

96
00:05:51.437 --> 00:05:54.650
There's some really cool stuff
they're doing, Pinterest is.

97
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.531
But again, it's gonna take a while for
everybody else to get on board,

98
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.600
if they ever get on board.
