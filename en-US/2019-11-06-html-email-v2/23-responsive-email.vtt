00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.026
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So let's start
talking about responsive email.

2
00:00:03.026 --> 00:00:07.423
This where things start getting a little
bit more interesting, because again,

3
00:00:07.423 --> 00:00:08.792
there are some gotchas.

4
00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:12.523
There's a couple of different ways to
make responsive emails across all these

5
00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:13.670
different devices.

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.320
So there's generally three approaches
to creating mobile email campaigns,

7
00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.280
which is increasingly important because
more of our world is going mobile.

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.250
We track email opens,
we have a tool called LMS analytics.

9
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.605
And that we anonymize a lot of that
data and put it up on a website called

10
00:00:32.605 --> 00:00:38.760
emailclientmarketshare.com, which tracks
the top ten popular email clients.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.960
And over the years we
have seen the adoption

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.690
of mobile just increase drastically.

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.490
So, if you're talking five, six years ago,
barely any subscribers were

14
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.870
opening on mobile, something around 10%
of subscribers, something like that.

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.420
Now, it's closer to 50%.

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.020
So, like half of your subscribers
are opening on mobile devices.

17
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.250
The most popular clients are Gmail
apps and the iOS mail apps.

18
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.320
Super popular,
lots of people using mobile devices.

19
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.440
So we want to make sure that our
emails look good on those devices.

20
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.200
So there's generally three
different ways to do that.

21
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.590
There's this mobile-aware approach
which we'll see what that looks like.

22
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.760
There's not really anything to do code
wise with mobile-aware, which is nice.

23
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.660
So it's easy to implement.

24
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.260
But then you get a little bit more
involved each step down that ladder.

25
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.710
So traditional responsive
is very similar to,

26
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.190
how you would build a responsive website
which we'll see what that looks like.

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.700
And then this hybrid or spongy coding
technique, which was developed in

28
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.800
response to Gmail, stripping out those
embedded styles in the head of our email.

29
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.290
So while traditional responsive uses
media queries to drive a lot of that

30
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.330
responsive stuff, when that was stripped
out of the email then none of it worked.

31
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.137
So this different
approach called hybrid or

32
00:01:56.137 --> 00:02:00.360
spongy depending on who you talk to,
was developed to account for that.

33
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.600
So we'll look at that world, we're gonna
mostly focus on traditional responsive

34
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.610
because since Gmail made that update
it's super reliable, works really well.

35
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.470
And almost every email client and
is easier for

36
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.650
people to actually implement because the
hybrid method gets, a lot more advanced.

37
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.000
It's sometimes brittle depending
on what you're trying to do,

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.110
if you're doing multiple columns
like four or five columns,

39
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.000
it can be really hard to get that
working reliably across clients.

40
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.280
So we will look at that what
that code looks like, but

41
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.935
at this point since Gmail updated their
rendering engine that traditional

42
00:02:35.935 --> 00:02:39.900
responsive approach is a really good
way to think about responsive email and

43
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.890
make those emails work.

44
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.750
So mobile-aware is cool though in that

45
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.340
you don't have to do anything code related
beyond what you've all ready learned.

46
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.590
So mobile-aware is more about considering
mobile devices, mobile users.

47
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.710
From a design perspective,
when you're first designing your email and

48
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.510
implementing it, so you generally want
to favor simpler layouts, a large text,

49
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.410
large buttons, and anything that
scales down well across email clients.

50
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.750
So a lot of mobile clients
will just simply shrink down,

51
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.320
almost like zooming out,
your email to scale it to fit that width.

52
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.040
They won't do any like reordering or
choreography of your content and

53
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.510
stack things like that.

54
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.920
But if you're not used to building
responsive emails, then you could just

55
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.870
design your email kind of like Trello
does, Trello does awesome emails.

56
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.800
They look beautiful.

57
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.510
They're fun and easy to use.

58
00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.040
But, at least recently, for

59
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.850
years now they've been doing it
in this mobile-aware approach.

60
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.330
I think that's a pretty recent email.

61
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.990
They may have updated since I've
been talking, I don't know.

62
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.490
But it's just this simple layout.

63
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.300
It uses large enough text that when
it's scaled down, it's still readable.

64
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.230
The buttons are big enough that
you can tap on them easily,

65
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.960
even when it's shrunken
down on a smaller screen.

66
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.220
But it's not using any code stuff
beyond just fix what containers and

67
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.430
the same kind of table-based
structure that we've seen all ready.

68
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.960
So this is awesome for teams that might
not have the resources to devote to

69
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.080
building and testing responsive or
hybrid email campaigns and

70
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.180
want to use this existing template or
it's good for

71
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.140
legacy templates that you don't have
the time to dig in and update fully.

72
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.180
So mobile-aware's cool,

73
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.075
just keep things big, keep layouts simple,
keep buttons easy to use, and

74
00:04:29.075 --> 00:04:32.960
it'll just naturally scale down on most
mobile devices and work beautifully.

75
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.930
But if we want additional
control over our emails,

76
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.170
then we'll use this traditional
responsive approach.

77
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.140
So this is those same tenants that we've
seen that Ethan Marcotte introduced

78
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.480
however many years ago.

79
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.730
What was this back in 2012, 2013, maybe,

80
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.580
when this responsive design concept
first came into the industry.

81
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.400
So responsive design as a refresher is
all about fluid layouts, fluid images.

82
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.630
And then using media queries to

83
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.720
adjust specific things across
these different device sizes.

84
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.570
So we're doing a couple things
all ready to get halfway there.

85
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.440
So we're using fluid images by default.

86
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.820
We have those responsive by default images
that automatically scale down because

87
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.670
we're using that max width, width, and mid
width approach on all of our image tags.

88
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.460
The fluid layouts were kind of there.

89
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.970
We have a couple of fluid tables, but
then we have those fixed width tables,

90
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.650
which we'll see how to swap those
over to be responsive and fluid.

91
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.021
And then right now we haven't
been using any media queries,

92
00:05:32.021 --> 00:05:35.657
but we'll introduce media queries
to our email to make those more

93
00:05:35.657 --> 00:05:39.110
minute adjustments across
different pieces of our content.
