00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.490
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Well,
welcome everybody to HTML email v2.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.440
This Frontend Masters workshop.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.270
We have a fun day filled
with email delights aplenty.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.569
I'm excited to kinda dig into some more
modern approaches to email development,

5
00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:19.409
hopefully show you
a couple of new tricks and

6
00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.046
interesting things you can do in email.

7
00:00:22.046 --> 00:00:26.034
It should be a pretty quick workshop
because all we really need for

8
00:00:26.034 --> 00:00:28.470
an email is this, right?

9
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.514
You just need an image dumped into some
HTML and then we send it on our way.

10
00:00:33.514 --> 00:00:36.924
Now, we'll get in a couple of
reasons why this is a terrible idea.

11
00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:40.782
And hopefully, you're not sending
emails that are all image-based.

12
00:00:40.782 --> 00:00:42.431
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: To kick things off,
I'm Jason Rodriguez.

13
00:00:42.431 --> 00:00:44.595
I work for a company called Litmus.

14
00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:46.315
This is our logo.

15
00:00:46.315 --> 00:00:50.015
Sometimes gets mistaken for like weird
Ironman logo or something like that.

16
00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.695
I'm the email evangelist there.

17
00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:55.645
I basically go around and
teach people about email design,

18
00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:57.900
development, marketing practices.

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.360
I've written a couple of different
books on email development.

20
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.220
You can check out my website rodriguez
comma j dot com, or follow me on Twitter.

21
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.170
But I spend most of my
time thinking about email.

22
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.740
I like to say that I've lost most
of my hair because of that fact.

23
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.321
Usually dealing with Outlook and Gmail.

24
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:16.572
Until recently, Gmail's gotten a little
bit better in the last couple of years.

25
00:01:16.572 --> 00:01:21.195
We'll look at how that's affected email
design development historically, and

26
00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:22.870
kind of moving forward here.

27
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.756
So today,
we have a couple of things planned.

28
00:01:24.756 --> 00:01:28.080
Pre-lunch, we're gonna be looking at
just the foundations of email design and

29
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.760
development.

30
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.410
So we're gonna be looking at
what HTML you're gonna use,

31
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.870
what CSS you're gonna use, and

32
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.600
how to make those emails accessible to
you, the widest range of users out there.

33
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.610
After lunch, we're gonna dig into more
about layouts and responsive design.

34
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.720
And then, we'll touch a little bit
on adding some interactivity to any

35
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.220
any email campaigns.

36
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.810
We're not gonna go super deep into that,
but

37
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.900
I'll show you some basics of how
interactivity in email actually works.

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.794
Because you don't have the luxury of
something like JavaScript in the inbox, so

39
00:01:55.794 --> 00:01:59.583
we have to do a couple of hackier things
to get interactivity in email working.

40
00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:04.134
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: To get started,
you don't really need anything very fancy.

41
00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:07.305
We're not gonna be installing any
frameworks or JavaScript libraries or

42
00:02:07.305 --> 00:02:08.280
anything like that.

43
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.630
You can use the editor of your choice.

44
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.460
I'll be using Visual Studio Code today.

45
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.410
But literally,
anything you can write HTML and CSS in and

46
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.180
see a preview works for
you, which is nice.

47
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.676
The tooling for
email development is super easy.

48
00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:24.980
The one add-on I usually like
to have in my editor is Emmett,

49
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.530
which allows you to just quickly
expand code based on shortcuts.

50
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.330
So if you do have that, it's nice,
especially when we start using things like

51
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.160
tables for our development,
because that'll save you the trouble of

52
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.130
writing table tr td,
table tr td a million different times.

53
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.876
So Emmet's a good thing to have.

54
00:02:42.876 --> 00:02:47.050
A lot of times, as you start getting
deeper into design development,

55
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.240
you'll start creating some well-worn
kind of battle tested codes.

56
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.322
So you'll wanna save those as snippets or
partials, and

57
00:02:54.322 --> 00:02:57.610
most editors allow you to have
that functionality in there.

58
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.660
So that's a good thing to have, too.

59
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.940
When it comes to previewing our emails,
we're just gonna be using a browser.

60
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:03.840
I'll be using Chrome.

61
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.030
We will look at another
tool called Litmus,

62
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.290
which is obviously the company I work for.

63
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.066
But we have an extension for
Chrome that allows you

64
00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:17.311
to preview your email campaigns in
almost 100 different email clients.

65
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:21.381
Which is really at the heart of email
development is figuring out what works

66
00:03:21.381 --> 00:03:25.257
across all these different email
clients and knowing what HTML to use,

67
00:03:25.257 --> 00:03:28.060
what CSS to use, and what breaks where.

68
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.632
So we'll see how that kind of works out so
we can preview those email campaigns,

69
00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:33.352
make sure it's working as intended.

70
00:03:33.352 --> 00:03:36.730
But really, browser works for you.

71
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.217
If you want to,
you can set up an Outlook account or

72
00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:42.791
a couple different email addresses and
send your test emails in there.

73
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:48.920
It's always handy to test on real devices,
but Litmus kinda eases the pain for that.

74
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.920
The code up there I put in
both CodePen and GitHub.

75
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.637
The GitHub repo is nice because it has
a read me with a bunch of different

76
00:03:56.637 --> 00:04:00.797
resources, links out to tools,
things we're gonna be talking about today.

77
00:04:00.797 --> 00:04:02.340
So definitely check that out.

78
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.110
But if you do wanna see
the CodePen stuff and

79
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.790
have that kind of interactive environment,
it's up there as well.

80
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.303
But
github.com/rodriguezcommaj/frontendmasters

81
00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:15.271
will get you that repo with all the kind
of finalized examples of what we're gonna

82
00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:16.601
be looking at today.

83
00:04:17.821 --> 00:04:18.747
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
anybody know who this guy is?

84
00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.392
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: It's not my dad.

85
00:04:21.392 --> 00:04:22.945
It's nothing like that.

86
00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.567
So this is Ray Tomlinson.

87
00:04:24.567 --> 00:04:27.293
Does anybody know what he did?

88
00:04:28.522 --> 00:04:29.318
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: No?

89
00:04:29.318 --> 00:04:32.530
He invented the modern concept of email.

90
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.262
I'm curious what year do you think
the first email was actually sent?

91
00:04:38.734 --> 00:04:39.281
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Anybody?

92
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:40.494
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 1969.

93
00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:41.172
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: 69.

94
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.974
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: No, close.

95
00:04:43.974 --> 00:04:48.804
1971 was the first use of
an email with that at symbol.

96
00:04:48.804 --> 00:04:52.085
So prior to that,
people were using things like the ARPANET,

97
00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:55.504
a precursor to the Internet, and
leaving messages on servers.

98
00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:59.729
But Ray Tomlinson invented that idea
of using the at symbol for an email.

99
00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.064
Who knows when the first kind of
marketing spam email was sent?

100
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.776
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: '91.

101
00:05:06.776 --> 00:05:07.642
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: '91.

102
00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:08.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Early '90s.

103
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.407
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Early '90s.

104
00:05:09.407 --> 00:05:11.276
1978, actually.

105
00:05:11.276 --> 00:05:14.909
Yeah, there was a guy named
Gary Thuerk who worked for

106
00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.624
DEC, D-E-,C
the Digital Equipment Corporation,

107
00:05:18.624 --> 00:05:23.310
which built like massive
mainframe computers and stuff.

108
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.240
So in '78,
he actually emailed a list of 400 people.

109
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.830
It was a message about DEC's new whatever
their mainframe was at the time.

110
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.770
So at this point, though, the ARPANET
was controlled by the government,

111
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.970
so it was the defense
communications agency,

112
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.300
I think it was, that was overseeing
this network of computers.

113
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.750
So when that happened, some military
guy contacted Gary Thuerk's boss and

114
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.620
was really pissed off
about that email campaign.

115
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.625
But it actually worked out really well.

116
00:05:56.625 --> 00:05:59.554
He ended up generating
somewhere between 13 and

117
00:05:59.554 --> 00:06:03.570
$14 million in sales from
that 400 person list.

118
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.510
But since then, we've kinda redefined and

119
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.490
seen how that definition of spam
has progressed over the years.

120
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.230
So in the last couple years, it's
something like 180 billion spam messages

121
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.180
are sent everyday,
which is insane to think about.

122
00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.610
That's a lot of email that's
sent that nobody wants.

123
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.830
But it's interesting to see how
that's developed over time.
