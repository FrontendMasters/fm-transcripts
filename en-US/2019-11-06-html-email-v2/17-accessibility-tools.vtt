00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.435
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: One of the big
things you can do though to help,

2
00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:06.182
you should follow all those guidelines,
but really, just testing for

3
00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:08.445
accessibility is a really helpful thing.

4
00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.405
So setting up and using screen readers,

5
00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:13.415
getting familiar with screen
readers can be really helpful.

6
00:00:13.415 --> 00:00:15.379
If you're on Windows, NVDA is awesome.

7
00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.975
It's free.

8
00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:17.177
It's easy to use.

9
00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:19.702
You don't have to keep it on all the time.

10
00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:20.674
It sits in the tray.

11
00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:21.450
You can click it on.

12
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.902
You can start reading through your emails.

13
00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:28.677
VoiceOver on Mac stuff, iOS, Mac OS.

14
00:00:28.677 --> 00:00:32.296
JAWS is a paid option,
a little bit more expensive, but

15
00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.534
one of the most popular
screen readers out there.

16
00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:40.430
VoiceOver is massively popular because
it's built into Mac's operating

17
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.690
system iOS, and it's free to us.

18
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.731
There's a couple of browser extensions,

19
00:00:44.731 --> 00:00:47.462
which I can actually show off
to that are helpful as well.

20
00:00:47.462 --> 00:00:50.540
So this is one of my email
campaigns that I sent out to you,

21
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.345
a fairly small subscriber list.

22
00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:56.216
Just updates about things that
I'm working on, whatever.

23
00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:58.722
But there's a couple of
tools that you can use,

24
00:00:58.722 --> 00:01:01.049
install on your browser that'll help out.

25
00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.836
One of my favorites is called NoCoffee
Vision Simulator which will allow you

26
00:01:05.836 --> 00:01:08.766
to simulate different visual disabilities.

27
00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.254
So low acuity,
it will blur that content, so

28
00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:14.020
you can see people that
have blurry vision.

29
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.649
What they're actually seeing, and

30
00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.651
this is where creating that strong
hierarchy is really important.

31
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:22.732
So using heading elements that are bigger,
bolder, darker,

32
00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:26.967
that they contain the child elements
will help people to scan that

33
00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.442
regardless of their visual ability.

34
00:01:29.442 --> 00:01:31.161
Contrast loss is important.

35
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:34.385
You can see how hard it gets to
actually read through this content,

36
00:01:34.385 --> 00:01:38.200
especially if you're using really
light-type faces on a light background.

37
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.352
Or dark-type faces on a dark background.

38
00:01:42.313 --> 00:01:44.215
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Ghosting
is interesting,

39
00:01:44.215 --> 00:01:48.934
see how unreadable that gets what
people have to content with that.

40
00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:55.630
You can even test out macular
degeneration, cataracts, things like that.

41
00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.337
So you can see how people with all
these disabilities have to interact

42
00:02:00.337 --> 00:02:02.214
with your email campaign.

43
00:02:02.214 --> 00:02:03.942
So that's one of my favorites.

44
00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:07.939
Let me turn this guy off.

45
00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.306
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: There's.

46
00:02:13.306 --> 00:02:16.487
It works better with the little bookmark.

47
00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:22.497
It is called TotAlly, Tot-Ally,
which is developed by the Khan Academy.

48
00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:25.807
And this just adds this little
tab down here with sunglasses.

49
00:02:25.807 --> 00:02:30.341
That allows you to quickly see different
aspects of your email campaigns, so

50
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:32.027
you can identify headings.

51
00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:35.875
It'll show you the structure of your
email based on the heading structure.

52
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:39.351
So you can see how that
hierarchy works out.

53
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:44.191
It'll identify any contrast issues so
it's actually looking at

54
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:48.506
the W3C recommendations for
ratios for color contrast.

55
00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:51.030
And telling you whether or
not you have problems.

56
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.660
It'll show things like link text,
what a screen reader will actually say or

57
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.130
any problems that you might run into.

58
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.540
So this link text is unclear.

59
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.560
I might wanna fix that.

60
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.010
If you have labels,
then your email would identify those.

61
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.390
Image alternative text landmarks,
so this really cool one,

62
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.340
is the screen reader wand.

63
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.080
So, if you don't have
a screen reader installed or

64
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.280
aren't familiar with using something
like that, you can use a tool like this.

65
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.084
Which you just hover over whatever
the element is, and it'll show you what

66
00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:24.211
a typical screen reader will
actually say out loud to that user.

67
00:03:24.211 --> 00:03:27.376
So for here, this is reading
the alternative text, which says

68
00:03:27.376 --> 00:03:31.391
an inaccessible image-based email
versus an accessible text-based email.

69
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.475
So, that's what hear out,
so that's super helpful.

70
00:03:35.475 --> 00:03:36.237
Just a couple of other ones.

71
00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:41.848
There's a cool one called Silk Tine,
which is a service.

72
00:03:41.848 --> 00:03:47.242
I think they're a testing service for
websites, but they have this great

73
00:03:47.242 --> 00:03:52.380
free browser extension that does
a lot of simulation for disability.

74
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.360
So it has a screen-reader emulator
which you can turn on, and it'll.

75
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.682
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The Intermittent Newsletter,
red heart suit,

76
00:03:59.682 --> 00:04:02.470
issue 35by Jason Rodriguez- Heading.

77
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.680
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
it'll read through your email,

78
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.403
show you exactly what
somebody is gonna be hearing.

79
00:04:08.403 --> 00:04:09.665
You can turn that on, off.

80
00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:14.320
It has visual stuff that you
can test again, blurriness,

81
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.170
different varieties of colour blindness,
which is cool to see what that looks like.

82
00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.600
Really important when you're dealing
with graphics and stuff like that.

83
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.563
Again, people that have tunnel vision,
have lost their peripheral vision,

84
00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:34.562
their central vision is cool,
cuz that hovers over it as well.

85
00:04:34.562 --> 00:04:35.776
This one's interesting.

86
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.450
Let me turn these ones off first.

87
00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.453
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: It's
like a flashlight.

88
00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:47.490
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: The dyslexia one's
interesting cuz this will actually go

89
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.150
through and [LAUGH] start rearranging
the letters in your email.

90
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.016
Which gives you an idea of people that are
dyslexic, what they have to contend with.

91
00:04:56.016 --> 00:04:59.860
Because their brain, their eyes,
just do that automatically for them.

92
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.376
So it's more work for
them to read through this.

93
00:05:03.376 --> 00:05:08.033
So this is where looking at your copy,
looking at the language you're using,

94
00:05:08.033 --> 00:05:12.634
making your emails more human and
readable sound like humans talking to you.

95
00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:15.887
And using simple language
could be really helpful.

96
00:05:15.887 --> 00:05:17.230
There's a couple other ones.

97
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.645
You have stuff built into the browser.

98
00:05:19.645 --> 00:05:21.149
Chrome has Lighthouse,

99
00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:25.880
which is an audit tool which will bubble
up any of those accessibility issues.

100
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.405
Wave is another one that's really
popular which will show you any errors

101
00:05:29.405 --> 00:05:31.555
that you might have in
your email campaign.

102
00:05:31.555 --> 00:05:34.997
Any suggestions, features that
you might wanna work into there.

103
00:05:34.997 --> 00:05:38.467
But really testing your emails
is a super-helpful thing to do.

104
00:05:38.467 --> 00:05:43.007
Because that will allow you to experience
your emails similar to how somebody with

105
00:05:43.007 --> 00:05:47.898
whatever disability they're contending
with will experience your email campaigns.

106
00:05:47.898 --> 00:05:50.798
So accessibility, massively important.

107
00:05:50.798 --> 00:05:55.210
Fortunately, there's things we can
do to make more accessible emails,

108
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.562
especially when it comes from
the design and development perspective.

109
00:05:59.562 --> 00:06:02.630
So again, using text,
using alternative text,

110
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.368
using all that good stuff that
we've talked about already.

111
00:06:06.368 --> 00:06:10.329
And then especially in email, making sure
that your tables are read out loud to

112
00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:13.960
people using screen readers,
using that semantic markup.

113
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.300
That'll provide that baseline,
really good accessible experience for

114
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.620
anybody using your email campaigns.
