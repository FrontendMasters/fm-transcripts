1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.302
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So I mentioned a couple
of times, accessibility and email.

2
00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:06.166
This is something that for a long time,

3
00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:08.489
wasn't really talked
about in the email world.

4
00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:13.150
Accessibility was always an afterthought
if people even thought about it.

5
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.619
We've been using tables for
a long time to code emails, tables are for

6
00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.720
layout are not inherently accessible.

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.170
We've been using all image based
emails which aren't very accessible.

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.020
We just haven't really cared about it,
but it's nice that there a move in

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.500
the last couple of years to
create more accessible emails.

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.363
But there's a couple of very specific
things you should really account for

11
00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:38.748
in email itself that's a little
bit different from the website.

12
00:00:38.748 --> 00:00:42.768
But why should we care about
accessibility in the first place?

13
00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:46.036
Hopefully, a lot of you have
studied accessibility, or

14
00:00:46.036 --> 00:00:50.817
take some of the Frontend Masters courses
about it, or at least thinking about it.

15
00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:55.626
Because it is increasingly important,
there's 285 million low vision users.

16
00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:58.740
I think this was from the World
Health Organization study last year.

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.740
39 million of which are blind.

18
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.710
So those are people that
are relying on assistive technology

19
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.950
to consume digital
content including emails.

20
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.740
So if we're not accounting for
those users,

21
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.410
that's a lot of the large portion of the
population that are completely ignored.

22
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.656
They can't interact with their emails,
they can't consume our content.

23
00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:22.314
From a business perspective, that's people
that we're leaving out of the equation.

24
00:01:22.314 --> 00:01:25.735
We're not getting money from them,
we're not participating with them,

25
00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.756
we're not creating those relationships.

26
00:01:27.756 --> 00:01:29.968
So you really wanna focus on those users,
and

27
00:01:29.968 --> 00:01:33.078
think about how we can create
more accessible emails for them.

28
00:01:33.078 --> 00:01:36.809
A colorblind,
8% of men are colorblind to some extent,

29
00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:40.630
there is different variations
of that by that kind of fact.

30
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.591
When we are thinking about links or
design of our email,

31
00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:46.496
what information people can
actually get from those.

32
00:01:46.496 --> 00:01:50.459
Women are a little bit better off
point 0.5% of women are colorblind.

33
00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.870
But still significant portions of
population that have these disabilities,

34
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.826
these different abilities that
affect how they consume our content.

35
00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:05.300
My favorite thing though is that this idea
that everybody's temporarily able bodied.

36
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.862
This graphic's from the Microsoft
Inclusive Design Toolkit which is

37
00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:12.243
an amazing resource for
creating accessible digital products and

38
00:02:12.243 --> 00:02:13.590
digital content.

39
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.530
But they propose this idea that we're
all only temporarily able bodied.

40
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.710
At some point we're gonna
have some sort of disability.

41
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.922
Whether that's a permanent disability
like we lose a limb, or we go blind.

42
00:02:24.922 --> 00:02:29.257
If it's temporary, it could be something
like you just got an eye exam, and

43
00:02:29.257 --> 00:02:32.673
your pupils are dilated so
your vision's a little bit off.

44
00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:36.507
It could be completely situational, or
you are holding a baby in your arm, and

45
00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:40.400
you don't have the full use of your
limbs for interacting with an email.

46
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.940
God forbid you're driving, you're trying
to figure out where you need to go, and

47
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.580
that information is in your inbox.

48
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.250
So you're distracted, and you're trying
to figure out where you need to go.

49
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.770
So anything we can do to increase
accessibility for the smaller portion

50
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.064
of the population that has permanent
disability is going to make and

51
00:02:59.064 --> 00:03:03.755
create a better experience for
all users regardless of their abilities.

52
00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:06.773
So it's really important to think about
that kind of stuff when you're designing

53
00:03:06.773 --> 00:03:08.950
emails, when you're developing emails.

54
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.730
So accessibility and
email comes down to those two sides,

55
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.750
the visual design of your campaigns and
the content and your campaigns.

56
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.880
And then the development practices
we use to implement that stuff.

57
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.790
So from a design perspective you
wanna ensure a couple of things,

58
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.230
you want to rely on color contrast,
keep that high.

59
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.910
So anybody with low vision, or anybody
with a dim screen, or like an older screen

60
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.330
that doesn't have as wide of a color
range, they can still read your content.

61
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.432
They can consume that content
interact with your emails.

62
00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:43.732
It's important for people with
any sort of reading disability,

63
00:03:43.732 --> 00:03:47.220
they might not be the strongest readers,
they might have dyslexia.

64
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.343
There's other things that could
affect the way they read content or

65
00:03:51.343 --> 00:03:53.232
process visual information.

66
00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:56.986
You wanna create a strong visual hierarchy
in your email so that it's easy for

67
00:03:56.986 --> 00:03:58.760
people to scan that content.

68
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.035
Get what they need out of that email
campaign, and move on with their the day.

69
00:04:03.355 --> 00:04:08.030
Again, with reading disability
is focusing on readability using

70
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.039
things like left line text.

71
00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:14.351
Using that generous font size,
that generous line height is gonna make it

72
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:18.885
easier for people to read that content
regardless of their reading ability.

73
00:04:18.885 --> 00:04:20.841
And then keeping layouts simple, and

74
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:24.680
making sure things like buttons
are usable, text links are usable.

75
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.540
Embracing those link conventions that we
saw earlier are gonna create much better

76
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.630
more accessible email regardless
of somebody's ability.

77
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.310
Readability is a big thing for

78
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.280
me just because I feel like a lot of
people don't consider it in their email.

79
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.360
So this is an email example,

80
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.690
you can see it's a huge amount of
text that's all center aligned.

81
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.540
For most people,
it's not a massive problem,

82
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.980
but depending on your reading ability.

83
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.650
Depending on just what you're
doing throughout the day,

84
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.500
this could prove a problem.

85
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.880
Because all of those different lines have
different starting points for a reader.

86
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.306
So mentally what your brain's doing is,
you get to the end of the line, you're

87
00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:10.598
jumping down to the next line, trying
to figure out where it needs to start.

88
00:05:10.598 --> 00:05:14.109
It might not seem like a big problem for
people that are comfortable reading,

89
00:05:14.109 --> 00:05:16.064
or have really strong reading abilities.

90
00:05:16.064 --> 00:05:20.333
But for others that's a huge hurdle for
them finding that next line,

91
00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:25.282
and it could create this friction that
sometimes they're unable to overcome.

92
00:05:25.282 --> 00:05:30.308
So using left line text is a great way
to just provide baseline readability and

93
00:05:30.308 --> 00:05:32.178
accessibility for emails.

94
00:05:32.178 --> 00:05:36.750
Because you don't want all these different
starting points for these lines.

95
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.410
I generally say if it's more than one or

96
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.950
two lines of text then
you should left align it.

97
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.030
Headings are usually fine
to have center aligned, but

98
00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.800
longer paragraphs like this
can be problematic, yeah?

99
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.453
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Maybe we're doing does that
apply for like justification as well,

100
00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.688
like or no-
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So, [LAUGH]

101
00:05:54.688 --> 00:05:55.791
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Somehow, yeah.

102
00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:56.580
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So there you go.

103
00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.191
Yeah, so the question about justification
so you can justify that tax so

104
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:05.197
that it has that even those outer
portions so the ending line and

105
00:06:05.197 --> 00:06:08.850
starting liner even it looks nice and
symmetrical.

106
00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.056
The problem with that is I introduced
those similar hurdles as rivers of white

107
00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:14.229
in between the text.

108
00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:19.974
So the spacing is adjusted in between
each word to make it that uniform,

109
00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:21.618
symmetrical look.

110
00:06:21.618 --> 00:06:24.089
But when you do that it's
the same mental hurdle for

111
00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:26.519
people that have any sort
of reading disability.

112
00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:30.043
So it's just creating that friction for
them, that frustration, and

113
00:06:30.043 --> 00:06:31.817
that's something we wanna avoid.

114
00:06:31.817 --> 00:06:37.035
That's why I usually suggest left
align text with that ragged edge for

115
00:06:37.035 --> 00:06:40.761
anything that's longer
than a few lines of text.

116
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:47.424
Headings, center line it, smaller blocks
of copy, you can try justifying that text.

117
00:06:47.424 --> 00:06:52.045
It's nice visual look, but
it's not really that useful for

118
00:06:52.045 --> 00:06:55.953
people that have to worry
about that kind of stuff.

119
00:06:55.953 --> 00:07:00.970
But the best way to make emails
accessible is to use real age email text.

120
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.006
So we saw earlier those image based
emails, they don't use that text, so

121
00:07:05.006 --> 00:07:06.777
anybody using a screen reader.

122
00:07:06.777 --> 00:07:10.310
They're gonna really have a difficult
time consuming that content.

123
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.900
There's nothing for them to pull from.

124
00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:15.490
So using live text, using html and

125
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.340
CSS is the best way to create
more accessible email campaigns.

126
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:25.040
As much of your design and copy you
can put into real text, the better.

127
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.140
This is a great example from STRAVA,

128
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:32.543
that does the exercise tracking,
cycle tracking.

129
00:07:32.543 --> 00:07:35.861
They have this beautiful email,
it looks gorgeous,

130
00:07:35.861 --> 00:07:40.516
has this big bold typography,
these bright colors, it's a great email.

131
00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:43.200
But most people would think
this is all image based.

132
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.820
But when you disable images, you can
see that it's almost all live text.

133
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.720
So that design is consistent across
those different experiences from

134
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.110
images being turned on,
images being turned off.

135
00:07:56.110 --> 00:08:00.887
Lose a couple of things like the logo,
the sharing icons on the right there.

136
00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:03.820
But all the important information,
your activity,

137
00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.680
your statistics that you wanna get
from that email, it's all there.

138
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.860
And it's all beautifully designed
because it is using html and CSS.

139
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.710
So I would urge you to use as
much text as possible, and

140
00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.476
kinda rethink that a lot of
people will think that for

141
00:08:20.476 --> 00:08:25.292
something to be accessible,
it doesn't necessarily look good.

142
00:08:25.292 --> 00:08:28.390
It might look outdated, or
not be well designed but

143
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:33.228
you can create really great while design
experiences like this driving email.

144
00:08:33.228 --> 00:08:38.043
And keep them accessible by relying
more on text than anything else.

145
00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:41.326
When it comes to development, there's
a couple of things we wanna make sure we

146
00:08:41.326 --> 00:08:44.090
account for
when we're coding our email campaigns.

147
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.382
Perhaps, the most important one is
making sure that any tables we use

148
00:08:48.382 --> 00:08:52.016
are accessible for
people using screen reading devices.

149
00:08:52.016 --> 00:08:55.784
By default tables like they denote
that you're presenting some sort of

150
00:08:55.784 --> 00:08:57.160
tabular data.

151
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.920
They're not traditionally used for
layout like they were never intended to

152
00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.940
structural elements, or laying out
a web page, or an email campaign.

153
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.520
So when you start using them for that,
if you're not accounting for it then,

154
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:11.150
somebody using a screen reader.

155
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:15.683
Will encounter your email, and it'll read
out each individual table, table row, and

156
00:09:15.683 --> 00:09:16.368
table cell.

157
00:09:16.368 --> 00:09:20.595
If we're using multiple columns, multiple
cells, then it will literally say table.

158
00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:25.400
Table row one of three, table cell one of
three before it even gets to your content,

159
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.391
which is a horrible experience for

160
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:31.045
somebody that just wants to get
into the content of your email.

161
00:09:31.045 --> 00:09:34.344
So the way we take care of that is
by using this attribute role and

162
00:09:34.344 --> 00:09:36.440
setting that to presentation.

163
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.950
So that tells screen or
APs is that this is purely presentational,

164
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.150
we don't want the table being
read out loud to our user.

165
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.903
So it'll skip over all those table tags,
all those table rows, table cells,

166
00:09:48.903 --> 00:09:52.089
and just focus on the content
of our email campaign.

167
00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:56.705
Which we're hopefully using that semantic
markup to provide that additional context.

168
00:09:56.705 --> 00:10:01.401
It should be noted that that role needs
to be set on each individual table,

169
00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:02.860
it's not inherited.

170
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.888
So a lot of times,
email designs will have nested tables.

171
00:10:06.888 --> 00:10:09.330
You'll have a container table,
which we'll look at again in a minute.

172
00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:12.990
But you'll have nested tables
depending on your layout.

173
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.120
So if you set that at that main container
table it's not gonna hair down to your

174
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.810
other tables.

175
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:22.509
So any table you introduce in an email,
unless it's presenting tabular data of

176
00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:26.872
some sort, then include that role
attribute and set it to presentation.

177
00:10:26.872 --> 00:10:29.510
Using semantic markup,
again, is really helpful.

178
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.870
That can help reinforce that visual
hierarchy by providing that same hierarchy

179
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.380
for people using assistive technology.

180
00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.660
So using things like headings,
and slanted like paragraphs,

181
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.470
and emphasis,
all those semantic elements that

182
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.550
work across email should be used to
provide that additional context.

183
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.601
Again, we saw using those
texts alternatives for

184
00:10:49.601 --> 00:10:54.397
all of our images is really important for,
not only accessibility purposes,

185
00:10:54.397 --> 00:10:57.319
but for
sited users that have images disabled.

186
00:10:57.319 --> 00:11:01.892
They can still get some sort of contacts,
some value from our email campaigns.

187
00:11:01.892 --> 00:11:05.569
And then we saw earlier when we were
you're just starting off with our dock

188
00:11:05.569 --> 00:11:09.566
using the lang attribute to make sure
that people using assistive technology.

189
00:11:09.566 --> 00:11:13.442
It uses correct language profile so
that they can understand exactly what that

190
00:11:13.442 --> 00:11:15.628
content of the emails
trying to say to them.
