&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So how many people
are familiar with responsive web design,

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.030
have built some responsive pages?

3
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.720
So I want you to take a stab at

4
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.630
trying to make those multiple
columns stack on mobile.

5
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.480
So you can just shrink
down your browser window.

6
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.309
If you're in CodePen,
slide over the view port.

7
00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:22.127
And see if you can get
those columns stacking.

8
00:00:22.127 --> 00:00:24.660
And whatever way that you
would think you would do that.

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.080
And then adjust the text size of things
like the headings, the paragraph,

10
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.000
the body copy.

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.174
And see how that goes for you,
and then we'll jump back in.

12
00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:36.773
And see how I would approach something
like that to make a responsive email

13
00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:37.520
campaign.
