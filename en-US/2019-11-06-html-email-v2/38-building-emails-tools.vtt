00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.124
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: I tools.

2
00:00:03.124 --> 00:00:06.690
There's a couple of different tools out
there that can help you build these

3
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.893
campaigns, a lot easier than you typically
would if you're just coding from scratch.

4
00:00:10.893 --> 00:00:15.693
Litmus Builder's our own dedicated,
essentially an ID and a build tool for

5
00:00:15.693 --> 00:00:16.972
email developers.

6
00:00:16.972 --> 00:00:20.228
You can code directly in your browser,
and you can see all those previews on

7
00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:23.290
the right-hand side which makes
testing those things really quick.

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.029
But one of the couple of things that I
really like about Builder that you can

9
00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.588
mimic in other platforms, but
it's sometimes not as easily is we have

10
00:00:30.588 --> 00:00:33.028
the concept of partials and
snippets built in.

11
00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:36.938
So it acts as this build tool,
you can pull in partial in,

12
00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:42.158
code blocks from this library that you
build up over time and just have that.

13
00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:47.198
It'll say curly brace, curly brace,
header, and it'll just pull that in.

14
00:00:47.198 --> 00:00:50.492
So if you're building a lot of different
emails then you can update that in one

15
00:00:50.492 --> 00:00:51.819
place, that header partial.

16
00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:54.908
And that'll propagate across
all those different campaigns.

17
00:00:54.908 --> 00:00:57.566
You can sort those snippets so
as you're starting to use more of

18
00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:00.637
these code snippets, you don't have
to recreate the wheel every time.

19
00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:02.625
You don't have to code them from scratch.

20
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:06.773
A lot of other cool things, we integrate
with PSP, stuff like that, but

21
00:01:06.773 --> 00:01:11.261
definitely a helpful tool that says I
think behind Dreamweaver which is select

22
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:13.718
the number one tool for email developers.

23
00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:17.111
This the number two tool
that people are using for

24
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:20.020
email development which was good to see.

25
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.087
You might be surprised that people are
using Dreamweaver but I think it's that

26
00:01:24.087 --> 00:01:27.860
design view that they have, they have
the code view and the design view.

27
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.532
So people are kind of clicking
around that wizard type editor,

28
00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:34.459
seem to enjoy that for
building email campaigns.

29
00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:38.193
I know there are a couple of questions
about like frameworks to try to

30
00:01:38.193 --> 00:01:41.012
abstract away some of
the like boilerplate stuff or

31
00:01:41.012 --> 00:01:43.980
some of the hacks that we
have to worry about in email.

32
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.535
So there are a couple of tools that
are out there out there that are really

33
00:01:47.535 --> 00:01:50.510
polished, really cool for
developing campaigns faster.

34
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.120
My favorite is this MJML, which stands for
Mailchimp markup language.

35
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.388
So mail is an ESP.

36
00:01:57.388 --> 00:01:59.140
So they do send me emails,

37
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.895
but they've invested a lot
in the tooling of their ESP.

38
00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:07.655
So they came up with this MJML
framework that allows you to abstract

39
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:12.330
away the underlying HTML and
sometimes the CSS of your campaign.

40
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.228
So you can see on the left
here on the code editor,

41
00:02:15.228 --> 00:02:18.140
this is the kind of
playground on their website.

42
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.170
They have great documentation,
it has ton of cool features, but

43
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.050
you can see it uses these MGMM or
MJ tags to build out this email so

44
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.636
they have a lot of different components.

45
00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:31.877
Those modules we were talking about,
already built in and

46
00:02:31.877 --> 00:02:36.046
it's kind of like an free email but
this will compile down to actual HTML and

47
00:02:36.046 --> 00:02:38.048
CSS that you can send with anybody.

48
00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:41.670
So that's the beauty of it,
it abstracts away some of that stuff.

49
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.511
But you still get HTML and

50
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:48.427
CSS that you can send to anybody
using any tool at the end of the day.

51
00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:52.981
It's cool that you can extend those
tags and create your own components so

52
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:57.094
you can still work with that
underlying code that's generated and

53
00:02:57.094 --> 00:02:58.868
build your own components.

54
00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:02.522
By the thing about any of these tools
these frameworks is that you're kinda

55
00:03:02.522 --> 00:03:04.674
stuck into how they build email campaigns.

56
00:03:04.674 --> 00:03:08.130
So you don't have full control over
what it's actually generating and

57
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.695
what that output happens to be.

58
00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:11.521
So this is good for a lot of uses but

59
00:03:11.521 --> 00:03:14.981
if you're building something
that's really like bespoke and

60
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:19.236
customized version of an email, hand
coding is still probably the way to go.

61
00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:23.387
Similar to MJML is Foundation, so
is anybody familiar with Foundation?

62
00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:27.808
It's like a log framework, pretty popular,
kinda like a Twitter Bootstrap.

63
00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:29.387
So they have an email version of this.

64
00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:30.993
It used to be called Inky.

65
00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:35.916
They still have their templating
languages called Inky but it's all about

66
00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:41.071
doing a similar thing where they abstract
away a lot of that underlying code and

67
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:44.921
make it easy for
you to develop campaigns really quickly.

68
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:46.610
So Inky is our template in language.

69
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.605
It's very close to MJML format or
those amp tags that you would see, but

70
00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:54.735
it just does it in the foundation's
own way and it's very similar to you,

71
00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:57.151
the web framework version of Foundation.

72
00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:00.239
So if you're familiar with it,
using Foundation for

73
00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.062
emails is a pretty lightweight,
easy way to go.

74
00:04:03.062 --> 00:04:05.849
One of the newer ones that
I'm super impressed with and

75
00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.283
wanna play around more
with is called Maizzle.

76
00:04:08.283 --> 00:04:12.204
So Maizzle is similar to
those other frameworks, but

77
00:04:12.204 --> 00:04:17.186
it takes things a step further and
takes it closer to that web world.

78
00:04:17.186 --> 00:04:19.391
So it's like this entire build process.

79
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:24.880
You can have JavaScript config files, you
can pull in different packages from NPM,

80
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.281
stuff like that to automate
a lot of this building and

81
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:31.156
work at more into your
typical web tooling.

82
00:04:31.156 --> 00:04:36.071
It's interesting too because they
use tailwind CSS which is a really

83
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:38.444
cool functional CSS framework,

84
00:04:38.444 --> 00:04:43.103
that allows you to really abstract
away a lot of this styling, and

85
00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:47.872
use classes to build out these
custom styles for your components.

86
00:04:47.872 --> 00:04:52.046
But Maizzle's relatively new,
I think it was released maybe a year ago,

87
00:04:52.046 --> 00:04:53.339
if not less than that.

88
00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:57.016
But, it's super interesting
because it's super powerful, and

89
00:04:57.016 --> 00:05:01.300
has a lot of these kind of head on since
they can all do really cool things with.

90
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.033
By any three of those
are really interesting.

91
00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:07.334
There's other tools out there
as well that are similar, but

92
00:05:07.334 --> 00:05:12.393
I would definitely say that, MGML,
Foundation and Maizzle are kind of

93
00:05:12.393 --> 00:05:18.320
the pinnacle of these frameworks that you
can use for developing email campaigns.

94
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.866
Tons of resources, you're all officially
email geeks now because you sat through,

95
00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:26.418
what, eight hours of me talking
about email design development.

96
00:05:26.418 --> 00:05:29.901
So it's time to go congregate
with your fellow email geeks,

97
00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:33.808
and the best place to do that today
is this email geek slack channel.

98
00:05:33.808 --> 00:05:35.739
So just go to email.geeks.chat.

99
00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:38.241
You have to submit a quick invitation, but

100
00:05:38.241 --> 00:05:42.147
I think there are automatically
allowing people into this point.

101
00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:46.351
But there's thousands of different
peaks in there all talking about email,

102
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:49.652
there's channels for
literally anything your career stuff

103
00:05:49.652 --> 00:05:52.449
your code Your Design
different events out there.

104
00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:57.094
You can obviously private message
with other fellow email geeks, but

105
00:05:57.094 --> 00:06:01.739
this is an amazing super active
resource for email developers when you

106
00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:06.164
run into some of those issues or
trying to troubleshoot a problem.

107
00:06:06.164 --> 00:06:08.613
You want to talk about a new technique or
something like that.

108
00:06:08.613 --> 00:06:13.066
This is usually the first place people
go to discuss that kind of stuff.

109
00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:15.725
A lot of people in there
try to be active in it.

110
00:06:15.725 --> 00:06:18.440
I definitely lurk as much
as I possibly can and

111
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.308
try to jump into
conversations when possible.

112
00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:25.394
But tons of smart people that are knee
deep in email every single day,

113
00:06:25.394 --> 00:06:29.706
that are ready and willing to help you
out with any issues you might have.

114
00:06:29.706 --> 00:06:33.199
Similar to that we have our own community,
our sort of forums and

115
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.004
resources on Litmus that are free to use,
free to access columnist.com/community.

116
00:06:38.004 --> 00:06:40.139
So there's tons of discussions about,

117
00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.350
there's thousands of different
discussions about troubleshooting issues,

118
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.952
different design techniques, industry
news, opinions on tools, stuff like that.

119
00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:51.543
There's a lot of code out there,
too, that you can access for free.

120
00:06:51.543 --> 00:06:54.899
So we have these snippets that
just collect specific things.

121
00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:59.660
So if you want an example of a bulletproof
button, you can go on there and search for

122
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:02.213
buttons and see those different examples.

123
00:07:02.213 --> 00:07:05.701
There's templates up there that
are full fledged templates,

124
00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:09.801
fully designed that you can download for
free and use and adapt as needed.

125
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:13.358
And then if you're looking for a job in
the industry, we do have a free job board.

126
00:07:13.358 --> 00:07:14.239
It's free to post.

127
00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:17.344
We have a bunch of different
cool companies posting there,

128
00:07:17.344 --> 00:07:21.455
trying to target the email geeks community
and get some smart people on there.

129
00:07:21.455 --> 00:07:24.297
So there's definitely some
cool opportunities up there.

130
00:07:24.297 --> 00:07:28.839
And I'm always surprised when we see
really interesting companies like

131
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:33.083
Twitter or somebody like that will
be posting jobs for Email Geeks,

132
00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:34.951
which was really cool to see.

133
00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:37.782
I have my own set of resources.

134
00:07:37.782 --> 00:07:41.039
It's at TheBetter.Email/resources.

135
00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.973
So The Better Email is of
the books that I publish and

136
00:07:43.973 --> 00:07:47.194
of course that I published
a few years ago at this point.

137
00:07:47.194 --> 00:07:49.088
So it's the better email on design.

138
00:07:49.088 --> 00:07:53.447
But I try to maintain this list of
resources that you can access for free.

139
00:07:53.447 --> 00:07:57.403
It's kind of my personal bookmarking
site for anything email related.

140
00:07:57.403 --> 00:08:00.028
So I have categories for people on the.

141
00:08:00.028 --> 00:08:05.481
I have categories for code examples,
tools, ESPs, articles, books and courses.

142
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:10.017
So it's a good place to go if you wanna
dig deeper into some of these topics,

143
00:08:10.017 --> 00:08:14.698
especially from, I talked a little bit
about how email's cool because it's

144
00:08:14.698 --> 00:08:18.605
forgettable and we don't have
a lot documented for posterity.

145
00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:19.910
But this is a good place to go.

146
00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.165
I have a bunch of articles and stuff
that discuss these different techniques.

147
00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:28.044
We've seen like hybrid coding,
like interactive email, and

148
00:08:28.044 --> 00:08:31.849
it has a bunch of older articles
that go into the first inklings

149
00:08:31.849 --> 00:08:35.748
of how this stuff was developed
through to modern techniques.

150
00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:39.617
So it's pretty cool, I try to
update it as much as I possibly can

151
00:08:39.617 --> 00:08:43.714
as I come across new resources and
try to add them to the list there.

152
00:08:43.714 --> 00:08:48.188
TheBetter.Email/resources, definitely
check that out.

153
00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:51.257
All that stuff is linked
to that GitHub repos balls,

154
00:08:51.257 --> 00:08:53.711
bunch of as well as
a bunch of other stuff.

155
00:08:53.711 --> 00:08:55.018
And then again, grab the code.

156
00:08:55.018 --> 00:08:56.284
We saw this earlier.

157
00:08:56.284 --> 00:08:59.609
It's up on codepen as a collection
you all have access to.

158
00:08:59.609 --> 00:09:03.242
Definitely check that out it because
that's a good way to dig deeper in

159
00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:03.919
this code and

160
00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:08.432
then tie it right back to what we've been
discussing throughout this workshop today.
