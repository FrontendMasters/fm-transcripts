00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.847
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So the first thing we
wanna do is to reset some of that default

2
00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:06.350
email client behavior.

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.877
So there's a couple of things
we're gonna look at here,

4
00:00:08.877 --> 00:00:10.800
is some Microsoft Office behavior.

5
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.575
That just kind of comes by way
of using something like Outlook.

6
00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:17.498
Then some browser and
client default behavior.

7
00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:21.248
And then the main thing though,
is disabling, not disabling,

8
00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:26.180
but overriding any auto-linking behavior
that certain mobile clients especially

9
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.940
will add into our email campaigns,
if we don't account for it.

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.332
So a good example of this
is this email campaign.

11
00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:36.109
You can see that it's using that
dark background and then white text.

12
00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:40.877
But we have a mobile client, I think
this screenshot was from Apple Mail.

13
00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:44.466
But you can see that it's
auto-linking things like days,

14
00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:49.657
that Thursday through Sunday, or Monday
through Wednesday, those dates in there.

15
00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:53.439
You'll see this with addresses
in your email campaigns,

16
00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.612
telephone numbers,
times, things like that.

17
00:00:56.612 --> 00:01:01.142
So it's helpful behavior because
they want you to use this

18
00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.644
across your operating system.

19
00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:06.797
So they see a date, they want you
to make a calendar event for it.

20
00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:09.337
They see a phone number,
they want you to call that number.

21
00:01:09.337 --> 00:01:11.544
They see an address, they want you
to use maps to look up that address.

22
00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:17.205
So it's a really helpful, cool user
feature, but it causes a lot of problems,

23
00:01:17.205 --> 00:01:21.530
really in two areas,
one is from a design perspective.

24
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.453
A lot of times, that doesn't go along with
the branding or the style guidelines for

25
00:01:25.453 --> 00:01:26.780
our email campaigns.

26
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.390
But more importantly, it causes really
big accessibility issues like this.

27
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.326
So you can't really see that dark
text on that dark background.

28
00:01:35.326 --> 00:01:39.583
So anybody that can't really
see that really low contrast,

29
00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:41.341
which is a lot of people.

30
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.667
I have contrast issues,
this is very hard for me to read.

31
00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.425
Or if you're using a mobile
device with a dim screen,

32
00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.215
then that's gonna be even worse.

33
00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:53.177
We wanna make sure our emails are always
as accessible as possible, and

34
00:01:53.177 --> 00:01:54.904
contrast is a big part of that.

35
00:01:54.904 --> 00:01:58.112
So we don't wanna disable this
behavior because it is helpful for

36
00:01:58.112 --> 00:02:01.219
a lot of people that wanna take
advantage of that information.

37
00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.151
But we do wanna override that
styling on our email campaigns,

38
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:10.063
to make sure that whatever they do link
will just inherit whatever that parent

39
00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:13.182
styling happens to be,
that original styling.

40
00:02:13.182 --> 00:02:17.168
So let's look at what that actually
looks like in practice, so

41
00:02:17.168 --> 00:02:19.211
we have our starter email here.

42
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:24.740
The first thing we're gonna do is add some
CSS to take care of all those resets.

43
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.438
So I have a snippet here,
I'm gonna expand.

44
00:02:29.724 --> 00:02:32.147
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So we'll see a couple
of things that were added up in here.

45
00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:34.461
This is stuff that's
essentially just boilerplate,

46
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:37.860
that we add to all of our email campaigns,
that do a couple of things.

47
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.830
So these client-specific styles
are essentially to account for

48
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.645
Microsoft Office products.

49
00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:48.506
So you can see we're using this
ms prefix here to make sure

50
00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:53.284
that Microsoft Office will
not adjust our text sizing.

51
00:02:53.284 --> 00:02:56.386
They won't shrink or
enlarge things unless we want them to.

52
00:02:56.386 --> 00:03:01.504
Same thing for webkit, that's just
to make sure they do the same thing.

53
00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:04.703
Sometimes they will try to
adjust our text settings.

54
00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:09.870
If you're using anything less than font
size of 14 pixels on iOS, then they

55
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.287
will automatically bump that up to 14
pixels, so this helps account for that.

56
00:03:15.287 --> 00:03:18.881
So if you do need really little copy,
which I don't as rule of thumb recommend,

57
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:22.263
you wanna make sure all of your copy
is readable, even those disclaimers,

58
00:03:22.263 --> 00:03:23.516
that footer information.

59
00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:28.170
You should be using something bigger 14
pixels, but if you need something small

60
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.421
for whatever reason, then that'll help
make sure that both Apple Mail and

61
00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.526
then Microsoft don't adjust that.

62
00:03:34.526 --> 00:03:40.547
These tables, since we do use tables and
table cells very heavily in email design,

63
00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:45.554
Microsoft likes to add some spacing
around those tables by default.

64
00:03:45.554 --> 00:03:49.574
So using this mso-table-lspace and
table-rspace properties, and

65
00:03:49.574 --> 00:03:53.996
setting that to 0 points helps us to make
sure that they don't add that spacing

66
00:03:53.996 --> 00:03:55.590
around our tables.

67
00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.241
And then the images, we just wanna make
sure that when we're scaling images,

68
00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:03.980
a lot of times, we'll be using
what are called retina images.

69
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.467
Which are larger images
that are scaled down,

70
00:04:06.467 --> 00:04:10.050
to make sure that they display
really clearly on high DPI screens.

71
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.665
If you're doing that,
sometimes in different Outlook clients,

72
00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:17.857
that interpolation is a little bit off,
so things look a little bit fuzzy, or

73
00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:19.422
introduce some artifacts.

74
00:04:19.422 --> 00:04:22.462
So if you set it to bicubic for
that interpolation mode,

75
00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:24.804
then it helps take care of those problems.

76
00:04:24.804 --> 00:04:30.087
Just general resets, we're again just
taking care of some defaults that

77
00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:35.466
different browsers and different
rendering engines like to add in there.

78
00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:38.701
For images, we wanna make sure that we
don't have borders around that unless we

79
00:04:38.701 --> 00:04:41.769
want that on the image itself, and
then we'll apply that to the image tag.

80
00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:44.738
And then we wanna make sure of the height,
and

81
00:04:44.738 --> 00:04:49.205
the height is just autosizing, so
it maintains that aspect ratio.

82
00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:53.735
line-height, we like to put just so
there's not different spacing and

83
00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:57.980
stuff added that we don't intend,
outline's similar to border.

84
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.323
And then text-decoration, again,
helps take care of any underlining on

85
00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:04.096
images that happen to be linked
that we don't want to happen.

86
00:05:04.096 --> 00:05:09.010
The tables, we want to generally make sure
that our borders collapse because we don't

87
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.909
want those table cell outlines.

88
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.338
And that just helps take care of that for
us by default.

89
00:05:14.338 --> 00:05:17.662
If you do want something like
that border for your table,

90
00:05:17.662 --> 00:05:22.163
if you have some tabular data or some
list of things, that's really common in

91
00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:26.066
receipt-type emails,
then you can set that on the table itself.

92
00:05:26.066 --> 00:05:30.756
But if you're just using tables for
layouts and that structural component of

93
00:05:30.756 --> 00:05:35.748
emails, we don't generally want those
borders, we wanna rip them out of there.

94
00:05:35.748 --> 00:05:38.459
And then again, similar to what
we do in line, we have body,

95
00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:39.800
we set the heights 100%.

96
00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.916
So if we're using any background colors,

97
00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:45.048
then it'll hopefully render
properly across email clients.

98
00:05:45.048 --> 00:05:49.470
And then reset things like the margin and
the padding and the width too,

99
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.726
to make sure that our
document renders as intended.

100
00:05:52.726 --> 00:05:55.305
We don't get all that added spacing or
anything like that,

101
00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:57.377
depending on what email
client you're using.

102
00:05:57.377 --> 00:06:02.642
So those blue links we were talking about,
it used to be that you had

103
00:06:02.642 --> 00:06:07.640
to essentially code in a little
bit of HTML to take care of that.

104
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.415
So if you had something
like some suspect text, so

105
00:06:10.415 --> 00:06:14.513
you have your address in the footer of
your email, you think it's gonna be

106
00:06:14.513 --> 00:06:18.768
auto-linked because it probably will,
then you would wrap that in a span.

107
00:06:18.768 --> 00:06:23.389
And then you would target something like
span, whatever that class happens to be,

108
00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:26.557
and then the child anchor tag
that's added in there, and

109
00:06:26.557 --> 00:06:28.422
then you override those colors.

110
00:06:28.422 --> 00:06:33.318
But somebody smarter than me discovered
that Apple actually adds this attribute

111
00:06:33.318 --> 00:06:36.929
to those anchor tags,
this x-apple-data-detectors.

112
00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:40.299
And that's how they tell and
provide that auto-linking behavior.

113
00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:45.265
So we can just target any anchor tags
with that x-apple-data-detectors

114
00:06:45.265 --> 00:06:46.855
attribute added to it.

115
00:06:46.855 --> 00:06:50.178
And then we can just make sure that
everything that they might change

116
00:06:50.178 --> 00:06:52.938
is inherited or
overwritten from what they would have.

117
00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:57.616
And the same thing kind of applies for
Gmail, Gmail does the same thing.

118
00:06:57.616 --> 00:07:03.273
For this one, though,
they do something funky where they

119
00:07:03.273 --> 00:07:10.788
change the HTML to be an underline using
this u tag, that tag instead of HTML.

120
00:07:10.788 --> 00:07:15.225
And then we're using that ID body
that we applied to body to say we're

121
00:07:15.225 --> 00:07:20.062
selecting that body and then any anchor
tags in there to inherit whatever.

122
00:07:20.062 --> 00:07:25.147
That's a weird color,
inherit any of those set

123
00:07:25.147 --> 00:07:31.006
properties that we have on
those anchor tags instead.

124
00:07:31.006 --> 00:07:33.509
Samsung Mail will do similar things.

125
00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:38.529
This has been kinda, they seem to be
pushing updates that will break this

126
00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:43.405
randomly, different updates come
around and this technique works.

127
00:07:43.405 --> 00:07:45.606
Then a month goes by and
that doesn't work, and

128
00:07:45.606 --> 00:07:47.209
then it'll be back a month later.

129
00:07:47.209 --> 00:07:51.668
So I think they're always making
updates to their client, but

130
00:07:51.668 --> 00:07:55.967
they usually add this
MessageViewBody ID to your document.

131
00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:58.662
So then you can just target
that with any anchor tags and

132
00:07:58.662 --> 00:08:00.196
override all their settings.

133
00:08:00.196 --> 00:08:05.993
Later on, we'll look at what CSS
we're gonna be adding in here.

134
00:08:05.993 --> 00:08:12.112
But we'll get into the best place to add
CSS to our emails in just a second here.

135
00:08:12.112 --> 00:08:13.636
Any questions about any of these resets?

136
00:08:16.314 --> 00:08:17.050
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: No, cool.
