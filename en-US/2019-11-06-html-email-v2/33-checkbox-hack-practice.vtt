00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: The main things you're
going to be worrying about are inputs,

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.470
labels, and

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.070
then the content that you're going to
be selectively hiding and showing.

4
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.284
So I'm gonna walk through one of these
examples before trying to get you guys to

5
00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:14.160
create your own interactive
experience in an email.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.210
So this is an Interactivity.html document
up on the GitHub repo or in CodePen.

7
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.500
So this what we're gonna be building.

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.730
It's nothing too fancy.

9
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.020
It's a really simple kind of
slideshow type tool here.

10
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.660
So we have these different slides.

11
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.050
We have these buttons up here, and
when you click on one of those buttons,

12
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.320
it just swaps out that content.

13
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.960
So you can see we have Slide 1,
Slide 2, Slide 3, just pretty easy.

14
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.510
This could be adapted for
something like a product slide or

15
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.000
a product view where you have multiple
products, and you wanna show those off,

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.920
but you don't wanna have a product grid or
something like that in your email.

17
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.820
So the way this works is by
relying on inputs of some sort.

18
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.750
Labels for those inputs and
then the content that you are selectively

19
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.650
hiding and showing, and
we track that state, the different state,

20
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.260
based on which input is
tracked at that specific time.

21
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.240
So if we were going to be doing this from
scratch, we'll do a couple of things here.

22
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.710
I'm gonna clear out a lot of this content
from our starter document just so

23
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.920
it doesn't really get in the way and
start fresh here.

24
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.960
So we're gonna add a couple of things.

25
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.073
We need the triggers for
switching that content.

26
00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:35.338
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: We need
the content to be switched.

27
00:01:39.808 --> 00:01:42.356
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: And then when
we get up here, we're gonna have to

28
00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:46.320
worry about these different states and
adapting styles and stuff.

29
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.663
So let me just drop down here, and

30
00:01:48.663 --> 00:01:53.900
this will be our interactive
elements that we'll add in there.

31
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.430
So again, we talk about these triggers
like the things that are going

32
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.004
to be tracking that state and
what those elements are.

33
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:03.725
While it's called the checkbox hack,

34
00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:07.420
you're more often going to use radio
buttons, and the reason you do

35
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.990
that because radio buttons only allow for
one state at a time.

36
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.400
You can't have multiple radio
button selected at the same time.

37
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.115
So you don't get into these weird issues
where you have multiple states happening

38
00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:21.390
in your stuff, you have two things
displayed at the same time or

39
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.940
your layout breaks there.

40
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.790
So instead of check boxes, we're going
to be adding inputs, type radio.

41
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.636
We're going to make sure we have a name
for those, in this case, we'll call

42
00:02:32.636 --> 00:02:37.439
them slides and then an ID for those,
each these are gonna have a unique ID.

43
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.198
IDs always need to be unique, and we're
gonna start the first one to checked,

44
00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:45.456
that's gonna be our default state,
is the slide1.

45
00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:49.070
So we can copy that and
paste it three times.

46
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.007
We'll remove this checked attribute
because only one can be checked at a time,

47
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.630
and then we'll update these IDs so
that they're unique.

48
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.400
We have slide1, slide2, and slide3.

49
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.455
So right now if we were to look at that,

50
00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:06.650
then we have these three
different radio buttons,

51
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.630
nothing fancy, but it gives us that
input that we're going to be tracking.

52
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.750
But you don't usually want those
radio buttons displayed, or

53
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.650
you want to style them in some way.

54
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.360
So usually, you're going to use something
else to be the switcher for that content.

55
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.200
In our case, it's going to be labels.

56
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.090
So we're going to use three labels.

57
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.440
We're going to tie them
to those radio buttons so

58
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.350
that they control the state for
each of those.

59
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.836
So when one of this label is clicked,
then it will make that input checked,

60
00:03:37.836 --> 00:03:39.990
and we are gonna give them classes.

61
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:44.860
We're going to associates with this label
here, so a label needs to be associated.

62
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.806
We're going to use that for attribute and
associate it with each input,

63
00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:51.500
so the first one would be slide1.

64
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.390
We want to do a couple of things like
add a class which will come in later.

65
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.240
We'll call this slide-label.

66
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.750
We have it for that, and

67
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.540
then we usually want to set
a couple of different styles so

68
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.090
that we know that it looks like a button,
we have that border and stuff like that.

69
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.970
So we'll just add a border of,
let's say, 2 pixels, solid black.

70
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.980
Maybe make a display inline-black,

71
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.090
so that they line up next to each other.

72
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.939
We want a little bit of spacing between
them, so we'll add a margin in here.

73
00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:30.906
Let's say 10 pixels, and
then we want it to look like a bottom, so

74
00:04:30.906 --> 00:04:34.392
we'll use padding here
on these elements too,

75
00:04:34.392 --> 00:04:38.678
give a some extra padding, so
maybe something like that.

76
00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:43.699
Open it up in a browser,
we have this label here.

77
00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.133
It doesn't always say anything,
so let's add some copy in there.

78
00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:47.570
We'll say slide1.

79
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.705
And then we can do the same thing for
each of the other labels, and

80
00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:58.456
then you're really just updating
what this label is for so slide two,

81
00:04:58.456 --> 00:05:03.310
slide three, but they're all
essentially going to be the same thing.

82
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.341
So we have our Slide 1, Slide 2, Slide 3.

83
00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:06.443
Whoops.

84
00:05:06.443 --> 00:05:09.600
That's add proper text in here.

85
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:17.010
So you can see when we click on these,
then it changes that state for

86
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.700
which radio input is selected currently,
and that's how we're going to

87
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.300
control that state and
selectively show or hide that content.

88
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.210
We need some content to actually display.

89
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.230
So we'll add a couple of divs here.

90
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:37.271
Just add a paragraph with
some dummy copy there.

91
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:43.007
It's nice to style this to see
what's going on, so we'll make this.

92
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.228
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: We don't
need to do the margin yet,

93
00:05:46.228 --> 00:05:54.647
maybe use a background color,
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Just go

94
00:05:54.647 --> 00:05:58.118
over that content, maybe add some padding
here, so it looks a little bit nicer.

95
00:06:01.012 --> 00:06:03.160
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
this might be that first slide there.

96
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.790
It's not really doing anything.

97
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.120
We'll add some other slides in here.

98
00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.274
But we'll,
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Make it so

99
00:06:11.274 --> 00:06:13.591
it's a little bit easier
to see each of these.

100
00:06:15.647 --> 00:06:19.090
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Sorry,
I'm a nut with alignment in code.

101
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.458
I hope everybody else is, too.

102
00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.943
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Let's make
this a little bit more obvious,

103
00:06:25.943 --> 00:06:31.561
we'll use like red, blue,
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: And gold.

104
00:06:33.598 --> 00:06:36.530
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
we have these three content blocks, and

105
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.450
that's all we want to be swapping out
based on the state of our radio inputs.

106
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.010
So we need to be able to
associate these labels

107
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:51.400
with each of these divs of content,
those specific slides.

108
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.268
So the way we're going
to do that is by using

109
00:06:55.268 --> 00:06:59.036
the general sibling selector in our CSS.

110
00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:04.936
First, I want to give these slides a class
here, we'll do slide and slide1, and

111
00:07:04.936 --> 00:07:11.340
then we'll apply that across the other
ones, too, just so we can target these.

112
00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.340
Do some general styling and use that
sibling selector to swap out that content,

113
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.960
so slide2, slide3.

114
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.089
Again, that doesn't change anything here,
but

115
00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:27.420
It'll come into play
a little bit later on.

116
00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.320
So then we're going to go up
to our embedded styles and

117
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.180
start adding all this interactivity.

118
00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.250
So the first thing we wanna do though,
is get rid of those radio inputs.

119
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.170
We don't need to display them.

120
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.530
So we're going to hide those inputs.

121
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.249
Then after that, we're going to
make those labels appear clickable.

122
00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:53.590
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: That's
easy enough to do.

123
00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.960
We'll see in a minute.

124
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:59.530
We're going to hide those
other slides by default so

125
00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:03.000
that it's not displaying all
three of those slides, and

126
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.453
then we're going to Show
the checked slides.

127
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.999
So this all will just kind of scaffold
out what we need to accomplish.

128
00:08:12.999 --> 00:08:14.863
So hiding inputs is super easy.

129
00:08:14.863 --> 00:08:19.410
We're just going to say input and
display equals none.

130
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.860
Pop that open, cool.

131
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.560
Those are gone.

132
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.400
We just have these different buttons.

133
00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.249
You can't see it, but it's still
updating that state of those inputs.

134
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.650
So if we could see this, then Slide 2
would be checked right now, Slide 3 now,

135
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.610
so that's cool.

136
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.850
Let's make the labels look clickable,
right now that cursor doesn't update.

137
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:45.130
It's not like a button or something
that'll force that cursor updating.

138
00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:49.979
So we're going to say label,
cursor equals pointer.

139
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:54.960
And now we can tell that those
are intended to be buttons,

140
00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.360
which is cool,
it makes it a little bit more accessible.

141
00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.770
So then we want to hide
the slides by default.

142
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:08.030
So we're going to say .slide was a class
we apply to all three content sections.

143
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:10.178
We're going to go ahead and
say display none.

144
00:09:12.481 --> 00:09:13.744
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: And
then those go away.

145
00:09:13.744 --> 00:09:14.802
So now we don't see anything.

146
00:09:14.802 --> 00:09:18.980
We want to get those slides back,
but we only want one at a time.

147
00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:24.077
So the way we do that is by
associating those content blocks with

148
00:09:24.077 --> 00:09:28.790
those different radio buttons and
with those labels, and

149
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:34.195
the way to do that is by using those
IDs for the inputs that we set up.

150
00:09:34.195 --> 00:09:38.337
So we have slide1,
we'll start with slide1 first, and

151
00:09:38.337 --> 00:09:41.870
then we want to use this
checked pseudo class.

152
00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.860
So we're seeing when that slide,
when that input is checked,

153
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:49.370
we want to display slide1,
whatever that content is.

154
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:53.825
And the way you do that is by using
that tilde, the little general sibling

155
00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:58.340
selector and then target that
slide1 class for that content.

156
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.414
So when we do this,
then we can say display equals black.

157
00:10:03.414 --> 00:10:08.567
So since Slide 1 is checked by default,
you saw that in that input

158
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:13.627
radio button, they will trigger
the display block of that div,

159
00:10:13.627 --> 00:10:18.708
that's the child of that general
sibling of that radio button.

160
00:10:18.708 --> 00:10:22.750
Since the other ones aren't,
they have a unique class name.

161
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.320
It's not going to trigger those.

162
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.170
So all we have to do at that point
is just chain those different ones.

163
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:34.809
So we'll do slide, oops, slide2 checked.

164
00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.520
The general sibling of that,
we want it to be slide2, and

165
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.040
that'll make that display block.

166
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.590
So now, when slide2 is checked,
then that content displays, and

167
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.990
the same thing goes for
our good friend slide3.

168
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.040
General sibling selector and

169
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.950
with that,
we have a really simple content switcher.

170
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:03.880
So there's not too much going on with it.

171
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.460
Once you break it down to that checkbox
hacks, it gets, I don't want to say easy,

172
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.720
but it's hopefully easy enough to
understand how that's working.

173
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.380
You need to track state somehow.

174
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.510
So those radio buttons or
a track box is how we track that state,

175
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:22.310
we usually don't want to
display those radio inputs.

176
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:23.740
So that's where the labels come into play,

177
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.850
and you can style those a lot better
than inputs are usually stylable,

178
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:31.330
to make those buttons or those different
triggers that people can click on.

179
00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.490
And then you need to associate the content
that you're selectively hiding and

180
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:36.960
showing with those labels and
those inputs.
