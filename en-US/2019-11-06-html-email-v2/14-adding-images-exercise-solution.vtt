00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:02.760
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Add in some images
hopefully you already had some,

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.390
if not add a little logo similar to mine,
and then a hero image, use something

3
00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.290
like Laurinpixel.com or something like
that if you don't have images ready and

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.150
make them responsive most importantly for
your email make them responsive by default

5
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.590
so that they scale appropriately
across the screen sizes.

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Question for you.

7
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.820
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.270
say you're using an extension for
EMET or just the built in one for.

9
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.910
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So I usually use EMET
when I'm coding something from scratch.

10
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.120
Like for any of the snippets
that I have been expanding.

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.060
Just speed things up as TextExpander.

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.920
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So I have those and

13
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.610
a couple just saved for basic things
like a boilerplate for like an image.

14
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You created those,
that's not an extension.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.100
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Yeah.

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.000
There's a good tool, you can go Litmus.

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.870
We actually have like an online
community that has a bunch of resources.

18
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.260
You can go to
litmus.com/community/snippets.

19
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.924
And there's a bunch of like
crowdsource snippets for

20
00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:01.306
things like that you can pull and
put in whatever system you need to.

21
00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:09.770
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Hopefully you all had
a chance to add some images to your email.

22
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.640
We can look at that code again real quick.

23
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.790
So we have our same email campaign.

24
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.670
We have the image that we added up here.

25
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.490
Again, we're not doing anything
responsive because it's that logo image.

26
00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.800
It's small enough,
we don't need to really account for

27
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.830
it on mobile devices, it's not gonna
resize or do any weird stretching.

28
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.620
But the main one is this hero image we
added descriptive alternative text.

29
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.266
We added this width of 600.

30
00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:39.580
So that in outlook it constraints properly
and it's not blowing out the layout.

31
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.540
And then most importantly,
for responsive stuff,

32
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.390
we added the max width to 100%,
min width to 100 pixels, and

33
00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.470
then width 100% to make sure that it
scales cross those different device sizes.
