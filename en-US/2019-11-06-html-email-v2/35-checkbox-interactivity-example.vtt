&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Go in to your email.

2
00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.070
You can start at the basic starter
HTML document if you want.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.370
And add some interactivity to it.

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.940
So you're gonna add those three inputs,
those three labels,

5
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.340
tie those together by referencing the ID
of the input with that 4#P for your label.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.010
And then start swapping out content that
you associate with those different labels

7
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.560
using that display property.

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.350
If you wanna update other
styles feel free, have at it.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.770
And just play around with the interactive
example and see how that actually works.

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.420
Play around with that mechanism.

11
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.711
We'll take ten minutes and
then we'll come back and

12
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.993
kinda finish up the rest of the workshop
by talking about some cool tools and

13
00:00:40.993 --> 00:00:43.726
resources to help you out on
your email development journey.
