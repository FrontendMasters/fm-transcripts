00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.980
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: I want you to take a stab
at creating a single column layout.

2
00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.219
So you'll have that table overriding
those properties, that browsers and

3
00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:13.130
email clients and by default, things like
cells padding, cell spacing, the border.

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.873
Create that single column layout by
making that percentage based 100%

5
00:00:17.873 --> 00:00:22.841
wide container table, and then within
that add that fixed width container for

6
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:25.940
our purposes let's make
it 600 pixels wide.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.790
That's a good clean number for everybody.

8
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.190
And then add some content inside of there.

9
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.934
You can build this on top of the email
you're already developing that has,

10
00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.160
hopefully, that logo, the headline,
the here image, some copy and a button.

11
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.835
So see if you can get that working
inside of a table-based design,

12
00:00:42.835 --> 00:00:45.430
that ends up being 600 pixels wide.

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.201
And then try to think about that email,
those table rows and

14
00:00:49.201 --> 00:00:51.810
table cells as components.

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.010
Do stuff like put your logo in
a single table row and table cell.

16
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.957
Put your here image in a single
table row table cell, so

17
00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:01.440
you can start building out that
modular design for your campaign.
