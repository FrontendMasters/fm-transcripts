00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.280
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
let's look at what a base document for

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.390
an email campaign looks like.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.870
So literally nothing very fancy
going on here, which is nice.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.570
It's pretty easy to get an email.

5
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.860
It doesn't get super-hard until you start
getting into layouts and stuff like that.

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.400
But a couple of things going on here.

7
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.060
We're using the HTML5 DOCTYPE,
which is nice and short and succinct.

8
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.070
We used to rely on the most
popular DOCTYPE used to be

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.192
the XHTML Transitional 1.0 from,
what, a decade ago at this point.

10
00:00:36.192 --> 00:00:41.440
It tended to force different email clients
to render that HTML a little bit better.

11
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.830
But HTML5 came out and
it's nice and short, and

12
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.730
things render really well
using the stack type.

13
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.070
So I usually push people to use that.

14
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.260
We have our HTML tag up here.

15
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.130
One thing to notice, that we are including
the language attribute on it.

16
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.130
Right now it's set to English since I'll
be coding and writing things in English.

17
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.970
But if you are sending
to different audiences,

18
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.370
you want to make sure you localize
that campaign for those audiences.

19
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.370
So this lang attribute is really
important, especially for

20
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.050
people that are using things like
screen readers or assistive technology.

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.650
Because that will tell the technology
to drop into whatever language

22
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.085
profile it needs to.

23
00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:23.684
So a good example of this is [COUGH] if
you are sending an email that has Spanish

24
00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.280
and it says hola.

25
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.820
But you still have
English as the language,

26
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.020
then it might pronounce
it hala instead of hola.

27
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.740
Which is absolutely not what's intended
unless you're getting a little

28
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.520
cheeky with your email copy.

29
00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.546
But this is important to have in there for
accessibility purposes.

30
00:01:38.546 --> 00:01:43.610
And the lang attribute can actually be
used on pretty much any tag, any HTML tag.

31
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.047
So common use of this would be if you
have multiple languages and an email.

32
00:01:48.047 --> 00:01:51.888
So your main document might be English,
but then you could have disclaimer for

33
00:01:51.888 --> 00:01:53.470
French users or Spanish users.

34
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.930
So you can go in there and set that on
whatever that container element happens to

35
00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.770
be, whether it's a table or div.

36
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.490
An old towel assistive technology
to drop into that language profile.

37
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.900
So you make sure accents and
pronunciation are correct.

38
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.720
We have the head up here, we're gonna
be playing a lot in there when we

39
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.320
get to styling certain elements
of our email campaigns.

40
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.630
But a couple of things in here,
I like to include the title in an email.

41
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.430
This won't be used in most email clients
but we've actually found through our

42
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.680
research that a lot of people will
triage their emails and the browser.

43
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.270
So you'll see something like that view and

44
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.760
browser link at the top
of your email campaign.

45
00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.020
And people will pop that
open in a browser tab and

46
00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.000
they'll use it as like a read
it later type service.

47
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.860
So if you include the title in there,

48
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.506
then you can have that
populated in the browser tab.

49
00:02:40.506 --> 00:02:43.466
So people know exactly what that tab is,
and they can come back to it,

50
00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:45.930
it's a nice little reminder for people.

51
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.360
Nice thing to do is kind of just either
have your company name in here with

52
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.630
a quick message.

53
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.950
If you have a cool subject line or
something like that,

54
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.050
you could pull it in using a merge tag for
most the SPS.

55
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.280
But it's definitely one of
those nice to haves and

56
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.980
it helps to with people that
are using screen readers.

57
00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.910
Because they'll read out that title of the
document when it starts going through it.

58
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.050
There's first meta tag, we're just setting
the UTFA to make sure that all of our

59
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.400
character and coding stuff are good.

60
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.440
And all those character render properly,

61
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.660
especially if we started using
HTML character stuff like that.

62
00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.360
The second one is all about helping
out with making our emails responsive.

63
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.070
We'll be looking at that later this
afternoon when we start digging into

64
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.930
different responsive approaches.

65
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.760
But this is just setting that width,
the device width, and

66
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.840
that initial scale of one.

67
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.930
I would encourage you not to disable zoom
settings which you can do using this.

68
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.250
But we don't wanna do that because
a lot of people will zoom in on

69
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.040
content to make it more readable or
adjust their zoom settings.

70
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.780
And we don't wanna disable that behavior
cuz that's not our right to do that,

71
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.640
we don't wanna override
those user preferences.

72
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.090
The second or this third one here is all
about just making things a little bit more

73
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.834
compatible for Microsoft products for
anything using IEE or IE Edge.

74
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.350
This'll just help out with
random little bugs and stuff,

75
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.480
it's kind of like a boiler plate
thing to keep in there just so

76
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.130
we don't have to worry
about weird edge cases.

77
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.290
And then we have a style tag which
is where some of our CSS will go.

78
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.560
But we'll talk about in a little bit where
we should be placing most of that CSS in

79
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.723
our email campaign.

80
00:04:19.723 --> 00:04:21.786
We do have something on the body here,

81
00:04:21.786 --> 00:04:25.450
we have an idea body which we can
use if we need to target that.

82
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.730
But this inline style just overriding
margin settings and padding settings.

83
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:32.800
We wanna just zero those out so

84
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.160
that email clients are adding
anything around our email.

85
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.470
Introducing that extra space
that they might do by default.

86
00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.592
This is important to have here on the body
instead of up here in the style block.

87
00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:47.437
Because some email clients will
strip out the embedded styles or

88
00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:50.507
the head of our document and
just display the body.

89
00:04:50.507 --> 00:04:54.255
So if we included there, that helps ensure
that it's consistent across the widest

90
00:04:54.255 --> 00:04:55.870
range of email clients available.

91
00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.320
Any questions about any of this stuff?

92
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.840
Pretty basic.

93
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.039
There's not too much going on until we
actually start adding some code and

94
00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.110
seeing how that renders
across email clients.
