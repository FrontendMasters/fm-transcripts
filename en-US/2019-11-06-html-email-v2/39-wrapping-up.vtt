&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: There's
a lot of random websites.

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.180
That's one of the great things about the
email community is that everybody's very

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.240
open and
willing to share what they've learned.

4
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.070
And the resources they've
developed over time.

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.760
So they add their stuff like that.

6
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.287
There's like, I think it's, have to check,
but like responsiveemailpatterns.com.

7
00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:23.390
Or there's an entire GitHub repo
dedicated to accessible email resources.

8
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.910
So a lot of cool stuff
that people have released.

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.742
So just hunt around, Google's your friend.

10
00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:33.495
The email community is super active on
Twitter too, just use #email geeks or

11
00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:36.610
#email development or email marketing.

12
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.580
And you can find tons of
cool resources that way too.

13
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.630
If you have any questions
about anything we discussed,

14
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.790
you wanna chat about
anything email related.

15
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.150
