00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:02.735
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So text is awesome,
I love all text emails.

2
00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:08.480
So I love beautiful topography,
I love simple designs and simple layouts.

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.714
But most the time you're gonna
wanna include some images in

4
00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:16.304
your email campaigns to spice it up, to
create a connection with your subscribers,

5
00:00:16.304 --> 00:00:18.650
to provide some additional information.

6
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.399
I love illustrations and animated gifs for

7
00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:25.761
providing some lightweight education
inside of email campaigns.

8
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:29.052
But there's a couple of things we
wanna make sure that we account for

9
00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:30.622
when using images in the email.

10
00:00:30.622 --> 00:00:35.136
The first one is that it's great to
make images responsive by default and

11
00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:39.507
there's a pretty easy way to do that
in email that's relatively new.

12
00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:42.040
It's been around for
a couple of years as technique,

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.193
but it's an awesome way to not have
to target every single image and

14
00:00:45.193 --> 00:00:48.260
then override something in like
a media query like that sizing.

15
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.280
The next thing is to always use
alternative text for emails.

16
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.900
So we'll look at accessibility after this
and why that's important, but you always

17
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.680
wanna include some sort of alt text for
the images in your email campaigns.

18
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.893
There's a couple of rules
that go along with that.

19
00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:07.959
If you're using something like a
decorative image, like an icon or a logo,

20
00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:11.084
then usually you want that
alternative text to just be md.

21
00:01:11.084 --> 00:01:13.707
You still have that alt
attribute on the image tag,

22
00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:17.001
but it's md because it doesn't
provide any additional value or

23
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.050
information outside of
that decorative element.

24
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.535
But then if you're using images that do
provide some of that context, some of that

25
00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:29.345
additional information, then you wanna use
fairly descriptive alternative text that

26
00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:34.043
describes what's happening in the image as
opposed to what that image happens to be.

27
00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:36.554
So instead of saying,
illustration of something,

28
00:01:36.554 --> 00:01:39.073
you would just describe
what that illustration is.

29
00:01:39.073 --> 00:01:44.643
That helps cut down on repetition because
most screen readers will say image of and

30
00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:47.720
then it'll read it at
the alternative text.

31
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.304
So you don't wanna say,

32
00:01:49.304 --> 00:01:54.214
image of a picture of a person eating
a sandwich [LAUGH] or something like that.

33
00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:58.803
And then you wanna make sure that you
stick to the stock standard image formats

34
00:01:58.803 --> 00:02:02.121
because some of those newer
image formats like WebM, or

35
00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:05.792
whatever crazy stuff that Google or
Apple are coming up with,

36
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:08.717
they're not gonna work
cross email campaigns.

37
00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:13.734
So stick to jpg or png files, gif files,
you wouldn't really wanna use

38
00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:19.350
a TIFF image because that's gonna be
massive and be a huge download for people.

39
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.735
But that's another thing, you wanna make
sure that you compress those images as

40
00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.439
much as you can without losing quality.

41
00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.747
You wanna make sure that you're not
cutting into people's mobile data plans or

42
00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:31.782
causing really long delays
in downloading that image.

43
00:02:31.782 --> 00:02:35.860
And this is especially important as you
start using like animated gifs in emails,

44
00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.256
which is a super popular
technique in an email campaign.

45
00:02:39.256 --> 00:02:43.808
But those gifs can get really heavy,
that file size can get huge.

46
00:02:43.808 --> 00:02:47.333
So if somebody's opening on a mobile
device on a mobile connection,

47
00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:51.302
then it could potentially take a really
long time for that image to download.

48
00:02:51.302 --> 00:02:55.927
But those three things
are a great way to use images.

49
00:02:55.927 --> 00:03:00.857
You wanna make them responsive, you wanna
use alternative text, and then you wanna

50
00:03:00.857 --> 00:03:05.663
rely on those tried-and-true formats for
those images in your email campaign.

51
00:03:05.663 --> 00:03:09.612
So when you talk about responsive images
the traditional way to do that on

52
00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:13.772
the web side would be you have an image,
it's used in that image tag in HTML.

53
00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:18.658
Then in your CSS, you just target
that image and set height to auto,

54
00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:20.470
max-with to 100%.

55
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.642
Since a lot of email clients will strip
out that those embedded styles or

56
00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:28.686
strip out that head of our document,
we can't totally rely on that.

57
00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:32.502
It's been getting better as Gmail and
other clients are making updates, but

58
00:03:32.502 --> 00:03:36.201
we wanna make sure that our images
are responsive by default without having

59
00:03:36.201 --> 00:03:38.560
to rely on additional embedded CSS.

60
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.488
So the way to do that is to first set
a fixed width on that image tag for

61
00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:48.166
Outlook so that it's properly
setting the size of that image.

62
00:03:48.166 --> 00:03:51.810
We saw earlier that when we had that big,
giant Retina hero image,

63
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.609
for Outlook it was breaking
out of that 600 pixel

64
00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.600
width because we're not doing anything
in account for that in Outlook.

65
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.108
And the way to do that is to use
the width attribute, that image tag.

66
00:04:02.108 --> 00:04:06.397
So we'll see in an example here, we're
gonna set the width to 600 pixels for

67
00:04:06.397 --> 00:04:06.983
Outlook.

68
00:04:06.983 --> 00:04:11.329
But then for other clients, especially
mobile devices, we can use inline styles.

69
00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.440
We can use max-width, min-width, and

70
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.662
width inline on that image tag, which will
force that fluidity, make those images

71
00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:21.792
scale across those different device sizes,
those different container sizes.

72
00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:27.336
So let's see how something
like that might work.

73
00:04:27.336 --> 00:04:31.783
I'm gonna go back over
to the starter email.

74
00:04:31.783 --> 00:04:35.835
So we have this hero image,
right now we're not doing anything fancy,

75
00:04:35.835 --> 00:04:39.562
we just have the source and
then the alt attribute, it's empty.

76
00:04:39.562 --> 00:04:44.147
But I'm actually going to
use one of my snippets here,

77
00:04:44.147 --> 00:04:46.746
[INAUDIBLE] saved email image.

78
00:04:46.746 --> 00:04:51.401
And you can see that we're doing a couple
of different things to this more

79
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:53.248
robust version of an image.

80
00:04:53.248 --> 00:04:56.896
So we still have this alt attribute for
here,

81
00:04:56.896 --> 00:05:00.258
I might say something like, in mailbox.

82
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.209
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So
we have a little bit more descriptive,

83
00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:10.099
it's describing what that hero image is.

84
00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.133
I'm not saying it's an illustration of red
mailbox because that's gonna be repetitive

85
00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:17.266
for screen readers, but
I'm just describing what it happens to be.

86
00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:20.433
If you're using images that
contain some sort of text in them,

87
00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:23.499
which is really common for
those big, splashy hero images.

88
00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.388
They might have an offer or
something like that.

89
00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:29.606
You would wanna describe that
in your alternative text,

90
00:05:29.606 --> 00:05:33.638
you want that textual equivalent of
whatever that image happens to be.

91
00:05:33.638 --> 00:05:35.486
But for here, it just gonna describe that.

92
00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:36.807
We have our source again.

93
00:05:36.807 --> 00:05:41.757
But then for Outlook, we're setting this
with to 600, which will be 600 pixels.

94
00:05:41.757 --> 00:05:43.919
We're including this border of zero,

95
00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.126
which is important especially as we
start linking these images [INAUDIBLE].

96
00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:51.591
Usually this will be linked out some
sort of landing page or an offer or

97
00:05:51.591 --> 00:05:53.260
something like that.

98
00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.270
Then we have this inline style, which
is setting this image to display block,

99
00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.210
which is good for Outlook because
some versions of Outlook will,

100
00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:05.180
by default, add some spacing around
images if they're not block level.

101
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.260
So if you display block it,
then it will just cut that out.

102
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.019
And then we're setting
the max-width to 100% so

103
00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:13.419
that it doesn't break
out of any containers.

104
00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.817
We're setting the min-width
here to 100 pixels,

105
00:06:15.817 --> 00:06:18.485
that's just we don't really
want it any smaller than that.

106
00:06:18.485 --> 00:06:23.385
But the chances of it getting smaller than
100 pixels on a mobile device is slim to

107
00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:25.562
none, so it's just a nice default.

108
00:06:25.562 --> 00:06:27.940
And then we're setting
the width to 100% so

109
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.120
that it naturally scales across
those different container sizes.

110
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.470
So let's open that back up in our browser,
and

111
00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.350
you can see that now it's
listening to that container size.

112
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.096
It's rendering it properly,
it's not breaking it out of there.

113
00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:46.741
I'm gonna add a little bit of
padding just above here so

114
00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:48.890
it stands out a little bit more.

115
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.879
Oops.

116
00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:57.114
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So yeah, it works well,

117
00:06:57.114 --> 00:07:02.382
it's contained within that 600 pixel
structure of our email campaign.

118
00:07:02.382 --> 00:07:06.885
And then most importantly though,
when we start scaling it down for

119
00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:12.341
different device sizes, then it will flow
across those different device sizes.

120
00:07:12.341 --> 00:07:15.594
So we can pop this open in Litmus and
see how that actually works.

121
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:24.293
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So
in all these email clients,

122
00:07:24.293 --> 00:07:26.220
it'll just be properly constrained.

123
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.680
So that's where that response
of by default comes into play.

124
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.445
Apple Mail, works awesome.

125
00:07:31.445 --> 00:07:34.528
But more importantly,
when we get into the Outlooks,

126
00:07:34.528 --> 00:07:37.485
then it won't be blowing
out that giant container.

127
00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:41.889
We're still getting this really wide email
layout because we aren't using tables or

128
00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:47.360
doing anything specific for Outlook yet,
which we'll look at later this afternoon.

129
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:53.130
So yeah, all the Outlooks it's properly
size using that width attribute.

130
00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.590
This is really important for Retina images
because we are using those larger images

131
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.310
and scaling them down to ensure that
works properly for the Outlooks.

132
00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.131
But yeah, it's a nice hack to
use that max-width, width, and

133
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:07.830
min-width on any of those
images you need to scale down.

134
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:11.805
Importantly though, we're not doing
anything to this logo image because that's

135
00:08:11.805 --> 00:08:15.667
already small enough that we don't really
need to worry about scaling that image

136
00:08:15.667 --> 00:08:17.269
across different device sizes.

137
00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:22.074
So we can just leave that width in there,
we can use the border radius,

138
00:08:22.074 --> 00:08:24.857
and all that good stuff as we did before.

139
00:08:24.857 --> 00:08:28.254
But we're not gonna do anything really
specific to that because we don't need

140
00:08:28.254 --> 00:08:30.168
it to scale across different device sizes.

141
00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:34.277
So yeah, we are doing all
that stuff in our images now.

142
00:08:34.277 --> 00:08:36.116
We're using that HTML attribute for

143
00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.021
Outlook to make sure that
width's constrained and that we

144
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.770
are using those inline styles to make sure
that it is responsive across device sizes.

145
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.635
That alternative text becomes into play
when we start looking at image blocking

146
00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:48.730
in emails.

147
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.529
So most people have seen
images like this or

148
00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:55.198
emails like this where that
email is all image-based.

149
00:08:55.198 --> 00:08:59.673
It's everything in that email with
the exception of that little top preheader

150
00:08:59.673 --> 00:09:03.603
text up there that says view in
browser and then probably the footer,

151
00:09:03.603 --> 00:09:08.795
which probably has some super long lengthy
disclaimer that's completely unnecessary.

152
00:09:08.795 --> 00:09:09.899
It's all an image.

153
00:09:09.899 --> 00:09:14.016
So a lot of email clients will disable
those images by default largely for

154
00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:15.590
security reasons.

155
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.280
We actually did a study a few
years ago because Gmail

156
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.205
changed how they handle images.

157
00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:24.356
Previous to the change,
they were blocking images by default and

158
00:09:24.356 --> 00:09:28.138
then they started caching all those images
in the email on their own servers and

159
00:09:28.138 --> 00:09:29.874
then displaying those by default.

160
00:09:29.874 --> 00:09:32.639
So by caching them on their own servers,
they could check and

161
00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:35.749
make sure they're not a security risk,
and then it enabled those.

162
00:09:35.749 --> 00:09:39.976
But it over-wrote your URLs and pointed
to Google server, it was a whole thing.

163
00:09:39.976 --> 00:09:44.519
But we actually looked at before and
after, and we were able to determine

164
00:09:44.519 --> 00:09:48.550
that about 43% of all email sent
had images blocked on Gmail.

165
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:52.540
And you extrapolate that out to all those
other email clients that have this similar

166
00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.116
behavior.

167
00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:57.410
That's potentially half your audience that
aren't seeing your emails if we're using

168
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.638
all image based emails.

169
00:09:58.638 --> 00:10:00.472
So it's a huge problem even for

170
00:10:00.472 --> 00:10:05.638
people that don't rely on something like
assistive technology like a screen reader.

171
00:10:05.638 --> 00:10:09.801
They won't see your content and the
chances of them going into their settings

172
00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:13.260
and enabling those images or
clicking on that little pop-up for

173
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:16.482
an image saying,
download this external content is slim.

174
00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:19.297
They're not gonna take the time to
do that because they're busy people.

175
00:10:19.297 --> 00:10:23.956
They have other things to get to and,
unless you have that brand relationship

176
00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:27.611
that's really strong,
they don't care about your email so

177
00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:31.930
they're just gonna delete it or
mark it as spam or something like that.

178
00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.194
When it comes to people using
screen readers, if you're

179
00:10:35.194 --> 00:10:39.954
sending all image based emails, they don't
really have any content to work with,

180
00:10:39.954 --> 00:10:44.400
so we wanna make sure that we have as
much content for those users as possible.

181
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.421
And that's why it's important to
use live HTML text, that true text,

182
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:51.382
in our emails as opposed
to just image based emails.

183
00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:56.176
And a design like this, it's relatively
simple to recreate in HTML and CSS.

184
00:10:56.176 --> 00:10:59.866
The only thing that really needs to be
an image are these people over here,

185
00:10:59.866 --> 00:11:01.304
those images of the models.

186
00:11:01.304 --> 00:11:05.094
Whereas all of this is just text and
you could easily do that with HTML and

187
00:11:05.094 --> 00:11:07.254
CSS, the buttons are easy enough to do.

188
00:11:07.254 --> 00:11:11.164
A lot of the companies will push back and
say, you know,

189
00:11:11.164 --> 00:11:15.784
we have brand guidelines, we have
a style guide that we have to follow.

190
00:11:15.784 --> 00:11:19.796
And a lot of times they'll have typefaces
that are proprietary to them or

191
00:11:19.796 --> 00:11:22.908
they might not work on web fonts or
something like that.

192
00:11:22.908 --> 00:11:27.029
In those cases, you should still push
back and try to use good alternatives for

193
00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:31.165
those fonts or those styles that work
cross email clients and are accessible.

194
00:11:31.165 --> 00:11:35.587
But if you're using all images or you
have to rely on images, then provide that

195
00:11:35.587 --> 00:11:40.358
descriptive alt text because something
like your URL isn't gonna help people out.

196
00:11:40.358 --> 00:11:43.763
They could very easily have the Handbag
and Shoe Shop, visit the shop or

197
00:11:43.763 --> 00:11:46.829
whatever that text is as the alternative
text for those images so

198
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:50.121
that when people don't see it or
if people are using screen readers,

199
00:11:50.121 --> 00:11:52.438
they know exactly what
they're getting into.

200
00:11:52.438 --> 00:11:54.120
They can get that value out
of your email campaign.
