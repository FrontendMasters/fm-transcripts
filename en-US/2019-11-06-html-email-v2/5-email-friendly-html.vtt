&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So what HTML are we actually
gonna be using for email campaigns?

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.840
I mentioned that it's kind of a limited
subset of HTML that you're probably used

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.810
to using.

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.030
And it comes down to
just a couple of things.

5
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.750
So for the most part, we're gonna
be using generic containers for

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.020
setting certain things like larger
style blocks for children elements.

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.920
So that's usually something like a div.

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.160
If we're targeting specific elements
inside of a paragraph, then we use a span.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.420
And then to help keep things accessible,
then we're using heading elements

10
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.130
H1 through H6 for those, you know, that
proper usage to provide those headings.

11
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.960
Other than that,

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.470
everything should really be wrapped up in
a paragraph tag for paragraphs of text.

13
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.920
If you want to, you know,
add that additional context and

14
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.930
help make things a little
bit more accessible.

15
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.170
You can use strong to bold or
use strong language to denote that.

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.790
And for emphasis, or

17
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.230
just use a span to update the styling
of that text inside of there.

18
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.180
And then the good old image tag for
all of our images, so nothing too fancy.

19
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.220
We're not gonna see a lot of usage
of semantic elements like section or

20
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.070
article or anything like that.

21
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.724
You can certainly add those things
in there if you want to provide that

22
00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:19.507
additional context for people.

23
00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:22.150
But in email clients if
you're using a screen reader,

24
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.210
a lot of them won't pick those up and
they don't support them yet anyways.

25
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.120
So it's kinda, not necessary,
it's not really necessary at this point.

26
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.570
If we're doing couple of base things for
emails,

27
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.260
they'll be accessible by default
which we'll look at this morning too.

28
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.220
But it's really about using
these very simple things,

29
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.790
relying on these ones to
get most of your work done.

30
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.580
Beyond this,
we're gonna be looking at using tables to

31
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.260
actually structure the content
of our email campaigns.
