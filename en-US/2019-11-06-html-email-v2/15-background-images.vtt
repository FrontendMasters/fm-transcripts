00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.068
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: One thing that people don't
necessarily know that you can do in email,

2
00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:10.270
or don't use it as they probably should,
cuz it's a really useful technique,

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.900
is using background images in email.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.810
So background images are just
images that are applied

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.650
to the background of an element,
pretty simple.

6
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.910
This is usually done using CSS,
the background property for

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.460
shorthand, background image,
background position, background size.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.350
There's a whole host of
different CSS properties.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.211
But for email, it takes a little
bit more work, nothing too fancy.

10
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:39.005
But it's super helpful because it allows
you to account for better designs.

11
00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:43.141
When you're fed a Photoshop mockup that
has a bunch of text on images, and

12
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:47.612
you're prompted to create an all
image-based email, but you don't want to,

13
00:00:47.612 --> 00:00:52.490
this is where something like a background
image can really come into play.

14
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.400
So you can still use live
HTML text in your email, but

15
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.150
then apply background images for
that graphic element underneath it.

16
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.110
So it'll allow you to get around, still
provide that accessible experience for

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.730
people, but have a really well-designed,
cool style for your email campaign.

18
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.250
A couple of things keep in mind is
that this uses not only inline CSS.

19
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.460
But to be a little bit more
reliable across email clients,

20
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.670
you wanna use the HTML attribute as well,
which we'll look at how that's applied.

21
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.970
And then this is really
useful on table cells.

22
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.890
So it works most reliably
when that background image is

23
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.420
applied to a table cell.

24
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.270
That's kind of a container element of
whatever that content happens to be.

25
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.210
So let's look at how
this is actually applied.

26
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.163
I don't think I have an assignment for
you guys,

27
00:01:39.163 --> 00:01:41.907
because it's similar to just using images.

28
00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:44.306
But we'll look at an example
of how this might be applied.

29
00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:50.410
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: I'm gonna open up
this background image example.

30
00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:57.591
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: And if we open this up, you
can see that we have pretty basic email,

31
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.280
what we've been building up to this point.

32
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.630
It has that logo, it has a heading,
it has a hero image, has a bunch of copy,

33
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.090
and then a button down below.

34
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.160
You can see we applied these background
images to just show off how that works for

35
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.956
an HTML email.

36
00:02:12.956 --> 00:02:15.070
So if we go into the code here,

37
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.640
you can see that we're providing a little
bit more structure for our email.

38
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.110
We'll look at how this works
a little bit later on too.

39
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.740
We're using tables to structure our
email content and fry that layout,

40
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.790
instead of just relying on that
max width on that container div.

41
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.880
So a little bit different,
we don't have that div for

42
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.960
each of these container elements.

43
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.711
We're using the container table
to provide that default styling,

44
00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:42.524
like the background color,
the color of the text, the font family,

45
00:02:42.524 --> 00:02:44.588
and then we have our usual elements.

46
00:02:44.588 --> 00:02:49.039
But then on something like the headline,

47
00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:53.930
where we have that,
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Where we

48
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.372
have this dark blue kinda transparent
background image, and then the hero image,

49
00:02:58.372 --> 00:03:02.310
where we have another one that's
a little bit lighter colored.

50
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.450
We're doing a couple things,
we're using the background attribute,

51
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.810
and we just provide the source of that
background image for that attribute.

52
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.140
So this helps with older email clients
that don't necessarily understand or

53
00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.700
render properly the background shorthand,
or any of those CSS background properties.

54
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.090
It'll make sure that that image applies
in those different email clients.

55
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.285
Then we also use this bgcolour,
the background color attribute,

56
00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:32.170
to provide a fallback color.

57
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.780
So this is really important when we
are in clients that disable those images

58
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.320
by default.

59
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.690
So they'll disable the background images,

60
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.030
as well as any other regular
images in your email.

61
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.985
So if you're using something
like white text on top of that

62
00:03:46.985 --> 00:03:50.785
background image, and that image
doesn't load and you don't account for

63
00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:54.395
the background color, then that's
gonna be completely inaccessible.

64
00:03:54.395 --> 00:03:57.195
Nobody's gonna be able to read that
text because it's white text on a white

65
00:03:57.195 --> 00:03:58.505
background.

66
00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:02.135
So it's good to provide this
fallback background color for

67
00:04:02.135 --> 00:04:04.035
when your images aren't loaded.

68
00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:10.257
For more modern clients, we can use this
background CSS rule, this shorthand.

69
00:04:10.257 --> 00:04:17.540
We can provide the background fallback
color here, the URL for our image.

70
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.434
You can also set things like how it
repeats across the x and y axis.

71
00:04:22.434 --> 00:04:29.130
If it's a larger image, like a graphic,
like a photograph or something like that,

72
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.100
then you can set like the background
size like to cover or contains, some of

73
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.628
that more modern stuff, to make sure that
it scales properly across those elements.

74
00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:41.130
But beyond that,
you don't have to worry about too much.

75
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.630
Combining these two elements, these two
approaches together using HTML attributes.

76
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.515
And the inline CSS will make
sure that it works across

77
00:04:49.515 --> 00:04:52.975
the widest range of
different email clients.

78
00:04:52.975 --> 00:04:57.831
It's still not gonna work everywhere, but
that's why we have these fallback colors,

79
00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:01.390
to make sure that any text that's
on top of it is still readable.

80
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.100
So you can do some cool things
with background images too.

81
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.910
You could add an animated GIF in there
if you want some sort of motion for

82
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:09.847
that background image.

83
00:05:09.847 --> 00:05:14.739
LMIS, a couple years ago for a conference,
actually used background videos

84
00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:19.550
to do a little bit longer,
lighter weight version of an animated GIF.

85
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.920
It didn't work everywhere, it fell back
to just a static background image.

86
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.900
And then clients that didn't respect that,
it fell back to a background color.

87
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.929
There's definitely some cool techniques
that you can use background images for.

88
00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:34.479
And it's one way to create more accessible
emails while still providing that extra

89
00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.639
styling that you get with graphics and
illustrations and photographs, and

90
00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.618
stuff like that.

91
00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:44.098
Again, this example,
it's standalone Background-image.html, so

92
00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:46.130
it's worth checking out there.
