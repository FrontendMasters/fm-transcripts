00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.480
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So this has taken us into
the last main part of the workshop, where

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.203
we start taking those email campaigns that
we've built, that are relatively simple,

3
00:00:11.203 --> 00:00:15.256
then we start adding some
progressive enhancements to them.

4
00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:19.658
So we're gonna add some animation, see how
we can have some basic interactivity and

5
00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:21.525
animation in our email campaigns.

6
00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:26.075
And then look at a little bit more
complicated interactive email example that

7
00:00:26.075 --> 00:00:29.645
would mimic something like a carousel,
an image switcher,

8
00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:32.445
something like that you
would see on a website.

9
00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:37.597
So, animation interactivity in email is
a hot topic right now in the industry.

10
00:00:37.597 --> 00:00:42.002
We do this research every year to see what
marketers are prioritizing, what they

11
00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:46.277
wanna focus on in the coming year, and
where they're setting their budgets,

12
00:00:46.277 --> 00:00:49.415
what they're actually
prioritizing with their money.

13
00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:53.490
And one of the biggest things every
year is interactivity in emails.

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.309
So it's good to see that people
are focusing on more important things like

15
00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.453
boosting personalization,
doing better segmenting, and

16
00:01:00.453 --> 00:01:03.919
using automation a lot better in
their email marketing programs.

17
00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:08.284
But 43.8% of marketers
are prioritizing adding

18
00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.781
interactivity to their email campaigns.

19
00:01:11.781 --> 00:01:13.889
There's couple of different
reasons why they might do that.

20
00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:17.944
It can drive engagement and
keeps people in email a little bit longer.

21
00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:22.019
When you get into really advanced
versions of interactive emails,

22
00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:24.805
you can even do cool stuff like,
in the inbox,

23
00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:28.395
you're gonna have a checkout
experience for our product.

24
00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:30.254
And for our conferences,

25
00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:35.337
we do the ticket purchasing process
starts in that interactive email.

26
00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:40.171
We've done weird things with having a live
Twitter feed inside of an email campaign.

27
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:43.677
You can do choose your own
adventure games inside of emails,

28
00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:45.540
it depends on what you wanna do.

29
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.801
But a lot of times you don't necessarily
need an interactive email for

30
00:01:50.801 --> 00:01:55.258
it to be effective and
to have it work for your business, and

31
00:01:55.258 --> 00:01:58.487
get what you want out
of an email campaign.

32
00:01:58.487 --> 00:02:02.286
The most common things that people are
adding from an interactivity standpoint

33
00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:04.723
tend to be those carousels,
the image galleries,

34
00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:07.460
which we'll see how we would
build something like that.

35
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.612
But it's essentially just tabbed contents,
so we have a couple of tabs.

36
00:02:11.612 --> 00:02:15.596
Some of them are hidden by default, and
then depending on what you click on,

37
00:02:15.596 --> 00:02:18.040
then it will display
some secondary content.

38
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.809
And we'll see how that works, but
there's other cool things you can

39
00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:23.209
do with interactive email,
you can have hamburger menus.

40
00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.174
If you don't want to show an entire
navigation bar inside of your email,

41
00:02:27.174 --> 00:02:31.541
I would argue that you should rarely have
a navigation bar in an email campaign.

42
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:35.708
But that's, I guess open for
debate depending on your opinion,

43
00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:37.614
you can do quizzes and polls.

44
00:02:37.614 --> 00:02:39.784
You can do some basic kinda forms and

45
00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.610
stuff to get feedback
from your subscribers.

46
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.436
You can do accordions say which is kinda
handy if you're doing something like I

47
00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:51.310
have a lot of disclaimers in
the footer of your email campaign,

48
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.249
which is really common for
retail businesses.

49
00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:58.600
The financial industry, higher education
oftentimes have to have a lot of

50
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.095
disclaimer information in their footer.

51
00:03:01.095 --> 00:03:05.110
If you don't want to display that by
default, you can put it in accordion so

52
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.838
people can pop it open if they really
need to get to that information.

53
00:03:08.838 --> 00:03:10.839
Some cool marketing type stuff,

54
00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:15.420
you can reveal an offer depending on
what they do inside of the email itself.

55
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.692
You can get really complicated and
add products to a cart and

56
00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:22.768
then send that over to your website and
then complete the purchase there.

57
00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:26.403
So all kinds of really cool things that
people are experimenting with in email.

58
00:03:26.403 --> 00:03:30.433
But the main thing to note is that it
doesn't work everywhere across the board

59
00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:31.492
for email clients.

60
00:03:31.492 --> 00:03:35.719
So you have to think really carefully
about what your fallback is,

61
00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:40.172
when you're creating this email to
make sure that it's still a useful

62
00:03:40.172 --> 00:03:43.114
email campaign for
the large number of users,

63
00:03:43.114 --> 00:03:47.515
for most audiences that won't be
seeing that interactive content.

64
00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:52.059
Some pros for interactivity though is
that it can increase accessibility.

65
00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:56.331
Especially when you're doing simple things
which we'll see about like using hovers in

66
00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:57.321
an email campaign.

67
00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:01.026
That's interactivity, you interact
with the email by hovering over and

68
00:04:01.026 --> 00:04:02.829
it changes some state in the email.

69
00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.555
That can make things more accessible for,
excuse me,

70
00:04:06.555 --> 00:04:09.637
people that need that added accessibility.

71
00:04:09.637 --> 00:04:13.668
They need some sort of trigger
visually to show that something can be

72
00:04:13.668 --> 00:04:14.806
interacted with.

73
00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:19.217
You can add some cool functionality
like that checkout process or

74
00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:24.361
things like feedback surveys or
something like that using interactivity.

75
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:27.760
And the big one tends to be, though,
just increasing that engagement,

76
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.498
that buzz around an email campaign.

77
00:04:29.498 --> 00:04:33.791
Like what we do with our Twitter feed or
something like that, or

78
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:37.518
in email game,
like a choose your own adventure game.

79
00:04:37.518 --> 00:04:41.387
But again, it doesn't work everywhere,
it works very few places.

80
00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:46.212
Usually Apple Mail and some WebKit
based clients are your main bets for

81
00:04:46.212 --> 00:04:48.510
getting interactivity to work.

82
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.980
It's usually complex to
add that interactivity,

83
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.569
we'll see how it's actually added.

84
00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:57.545
It's not just using JavaScript or
something like that,

85
00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:01.389
it's kind of like most things email
it's an old school approach to adding

86
00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.688
interactivity to some
markup on a web page.

87
00:05:03.688 --> 00:05:06.540
It can be harder to track
depending on what you're doing.

88
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.646
You have to think more deeply about
how you're tracking engagement,

89
00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:13.919
set up triggers for
those different interactive states

90
00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.062
to let you analyze how people
are using those emails.

91
00:05:17.062 --> 00:05:20.601
And then, more often than not, it tends
to be flashy instead of functional.

92
00:05:20.601 --> 00:05:25.059
So there's no real goal behind the
campaign, other than to make it flashy and

93
00:05:25.059 --> 00:05:28.503
create some buzz around your brand or
something like that.

94
00:05:28.503 --> 00:05:33.013
So, I would suggest if you're thinking
about adding interactivity consider why

95
00:05:33.013 --> 00:05:35.313
you would wanna add that interactivity.

96
00:05:35.313 --> 00:05:38.931
If there's a real goal behind it,
if you're providing some sort of

97
00:05:38.931 --> 00:05:42.363
functionality that people really
are asking for in your email.

98
00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:45.730
Or you wanna show off and it actually
works for your product or your company,

99
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.320
then that's awesome,
definitely check this stuff out.

100
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.234
But if not,
you're just trying to be flashy and stuff,

101
00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:55.092
you can oftentimes get away with just
having a nice animated GIF in there.

102
00:05:55.092 --> 00:05:58.378
Or, getting them out of the inbox and
back on your website or

103
00:05:58.378 --> 00:06:01.994
in your application where you can
do all that stuff a lot better and

104
00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:04.660
a lot more readily than
you can inside of email.
