00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
when you get into more advanced stuff

2
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.534
like that example,
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: That we saw before,

3
00:00:11.534 --> 00:00:13.806
all of these different elements are,

4
00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:18.574
in this case it would be track boxes
because you're tracking multiple states.

5
00:00:18.574 --> 00:00:22.999
But something like that color switcher or
the size switcher, those are gonna be

6
00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.176
radio inputs, because you only want
one of those states checked at a time.

7
00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:32.696
But all of this just uses a more complex
variation of that check box hack.

8
00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:36.204
There's a lot of styling that
goes into something like this.

9
00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:39.814
When you start thinking about fallbacks,
you have to consider what

10
00:00:39.814 --> 00:00:44.011
that experience is because this checkbox
hack isn't gonna work everywhere.

11
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:48.620
So in that case, you might just have
whatever that product happens to be and

12
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.538
then a CTA button that says go visit it on
the website or check out on the website.

13
00:00:53.538 --> 00:00:58.227
But there's a lot of stuff you can
do just taking that really simple

14
00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:02.006
checkbox hack and
then applying it in creative ways.

15
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.403
Test as much as you possibly can when
you're using something like this.

16
00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:10.383
It doesn't work everywhere, it's usually
Apple Mail or webkit-based email clients.

17
00:01:10.383 --> 00:01:13.162
And just make sure you're thinking
about those fallbacks and

18
00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:14.346
having good experience.

19
00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:18.155
In the case of the example that we were
playing with, the fallback would just

20
00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:22.277
be hiding those labels so that it doesn't
look like there's anything to switch.

21
00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:25.215
And then you can stack those.

22
00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:32.555
I think I have it on
the mobile version here.

23
00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:36.426
So when you get down to mobile,
where just, this will be the fallback for

24
00:01:36.426 --> 00:01:39.355
anything that doesn't
display that interactivity.

25
00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:42.629
We can hide those labels, those inputs,
so that it doesn't look like anything's

26
00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:44.469
clickable, then we just
stack that content.

27
00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.797
So all of that content still visible,

28
00:01:46.797 --> 00:01:50.290
still available for
anybody that wants to access it, but

29
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.047
they don't get that nice little
progressive enhancement of that switcher.

30
00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:56.056
Any questions about that?

31
00:01:56.056 --> 00:01:59.254
I feel like it can get really complicated.

32
00:01:59.254 --> 00:02:03.447
I'll try to put up on the GitHub repo
some additional examples of some

33
00:02:03.447 --> 00:02:06.136
of the crazier stuff
that people have done.

34
00:02:06.136 --> 00:02:10.729
We did for the launch of our litmus
builder, our code editor for

35
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.122
email designers.

36
00:02:12.122 --> 00:02:17.056
We built our it was an interactive
product tour of the builder product.

37
00:02:17.056 --> 00:02:21.459
So it had these little kinda glowing
icons, when you tapped on it,

38
00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.405
it would pop open a tool tip and
tell you about that feature.

39
00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:28.964
You'd go to the next one,
it was this cool interactive product tour.

40
00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:34.186
But I feel that's a good example of using
this checkbox hack to provide this really

41
00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:39.345
elegant, interesting, and educational
experience for subscribers, yeah?

42
00:02:39.345 --> 00:02:43.623
&gt;&gt; Student: This may not be relevant,
it's more just for curiosity, but

43
00:02:43.623 --> 00:02:47.254
on the example like shopping
cart within the email.

44
00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:49.036
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Student: Do you know if they're just

45
00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:53.682
like constructing a insane set of string
params that then gets sent over the wire?

46
00:02:53.682 --> 00:02:55.896
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Yes
that's exactly how it works.

47
00:02:55.896 --> 00:02:58.738
So when you add those
different states then it's,

48
00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:02.914
you're essentially updating that URL and
sending it over as a parameter.

49
00:03:02.914 --> 00:03:06.821
So when you hit your application or
whatever the web app is,

50
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:12.076
then it'll read that populate the check
out, and you can just finish up there.

51
00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:15.805
So yeah, you can get super complex
with this kinda stuff, but

52
00:03:15.805 --> 00:03:19.760
it's pretty damn cool what people
have been able to come up with.

53
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.418
I was saying earlier too,
you can do some cool things where,

54
00:03:23.418 --> 00:03:28.249
this is where interactive stuff is kinda
where linked CSS might come into play.

55
00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:33.109
So I was saying before, most email clients
will strip out that linked style sheet.

56
00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:36.349
But you can do some cool stuff using
linked style sheets for clients that

57
00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.348
support it, like Apple Mail, where you can
have these different interactive states.

58
00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:44.879
And then you can dynamically feed in
content using a linked style sheet.

59
00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.799
So in your content here,
this might be an element with a class, and

60
00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.739
there's nothing by default
in that element, but

61
00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.604
then you can use this CSS content
property and a link style sheet.

62
00:03:55.604 --> 00:03:59.424
So on your server you can inject
whatever the hell you want into that CSS

63
00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:01.842
style sheet, into that content property.

64
00:04:01.842 --> 00:04:06.269
And then when you trigger say an email
then it pulls in, loads that link style

65
00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.062
sheet, and that content property fills
out whatever that content happens to be.

66
00:04:11.062 --> 00:04:15.294
There's another guy that does a lot of
interactive stuff named Cyril Gross who

67
00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:19.077
works, I believe he's Swedish,
works over in Sweden for Mayoress,

68
00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:20.182
which is an agency.

69
00:04:20.182 --> 00:04:24.483
And he built a really cool interactive
dynamic advent calendar for

70
00:04:24.483 --> 00:04:28.882
Christmas for I think like
American Express or somebody like that.

71
00:04:28.882 --> 00:04:31.896
So every day they would
update that style sheet and

72
00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:34.708
reveal another grid in
that advent calendar.

73
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:38.472
When you clicked on an element it would
pop up a modal and have information or

74
00:04:38.472 --> 00:04:40.165
a dealer, something like that.

75
00:04:40.165 --> 00:04:42.849
So crazy stuff you can do inside of email.

76
00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.020
But it all hinges on this
checkbox hack which is brilliant.
