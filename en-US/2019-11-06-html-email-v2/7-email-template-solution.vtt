00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.619
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So hopefully you don't
have any trouble adding a couple headings

2
00:00:05.619 --> 00:00:08.737
and paragraph of text and
an image to your email.

3
00:00:08.737 --> 00:00:13.309
But let's look at what that looks like
if I'm coding something like that.

4
00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.130
So we have our starter document in here.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.981
We added in that CSS reset to just
cancel any of that default behavior,

6
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.120
override that link styling but

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.986
still maintain that auto-linking
behavior for people that need it.

8
00:00:26.986 --> 00:00:31.273
So what I like to do is usually use
comments to scaffold out what's gonna be

9
00:00:31.273 --> 00:00:32.250
under my email.

10
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.283
So for this, it's gonna be pretty
simple single column thing.

11
00:00:35.283 --> 00:00:41.036
I'm gonna have a logo image in here.

12
00:00:41.036 --> 00:00:47.053
Let's say a headline of some sort.

13
00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:49.125
We wanna have a hero image.

14
00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.757
We'll make it look kind of like a simple
marketing message that a lot of people

15
00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:55.831
are sending out, some body copy.

16
00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.497
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Since it's email,
we wanna put it to work and

17
00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:03.737
make sure that it has some goal
associated with that campaign.

18
00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:06.033
And that's usually we're trying
to get people some place.

19
00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.520
We want them out of the inbox and
onto our website, onto our product page,

20
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.160
in our app, something like that.

21
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.181
So we usually wanna include
a call-to-action of some sort.

22
00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:16.896
So we'll add a button down here.

23
00:01:16.896 --> 00:01:18.892
And then since you're sending email,

24
00:01:18.892 --> 00:01:22.470
there are legal requirements when
you're sending those campaigns.

25
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.409
And a lot of that is tied up
in the footer of the email.

26
00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.624
So this is where we'll add in
things like an unsubscribe link,

27
00:01:29.624 --> 00:01:31.759
which every email campaign should have.

28
00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.285
Unless it's a transactional email, it's
not required, but sometimes it is handy to

29
00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:40.448
have those depending on what type of
transactional campaign that actually is.

30
00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:43.595
You'll wanna add in something
like your address in there.

31
00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:47.297
So people know you as a sender,
where you're sending from.

32
00:01:47.297 --> 00:01:52.079
That's actually required by the CAN-SPAM
law that dictates how we can send

33
00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.028
email messages for marketing purposes and
transactional purposes in the US.

34
00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:00.498
There's newer laws too that you
should probably be aware of,

35
00:02:00.498 --> 00:02:04.915
even though if you don't wanna like dig
in too deeply, but Canada has CASTLE.

36
00:02:04.915 --> 00:02:07.510
I forget what it actually stands for.

37
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.494
But that's their law.

38
00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:12.378
That's kinda like CAN-SPAM, but
it's a lot more strict than that.

39
00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:15.735
And then,
have most people heard about GDPR?

40
00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:19.367
So the general data protection regulation.

41
00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:23.137
Which is a European law that
dictates what you can and

42
00:02:23.137 --> 00:02:29.402
cannot do when you're collecting email
addresses, when you're sending messages.

43
00:02:29.402 --> 00:02:32.975
But it's super strict compared
to something like CAN-SPAM.

44
00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:34.912
So there's a lot of things
we have to account for.

45
00:02:34.912 --> 00:02:37.820
And a lot of that ends up in
the footer of your email.

46
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.193
So just be aware of those things.

47
00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:42.503
Definitely, if you have any
questions about any of that stuff or

48
00:02:42.503 --> 00:02:46.871
wanna dig into other resources later on or
during break, then I'm happy to do that.

49
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:49.029
But yeah,
this will be a pretty basic email.

50
00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.485
We'll have the logo in the top here.

51
00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:56.179
So, for our purposes,
let's add just an image tag.

52
00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.134
And then I have some
images in a folder here.

53
00:02:59.134 --> 00:03:01.180
We'll use the logo.

54
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.337
We won't do anything beyond that.

55
00:03:02.337 --> 00:03:07.100
We're gonna look at what a good image
tag looks like for email later on.

56
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.043
The headline, since this is the main
heading, we're gonna use an h1 tag.

57
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.486
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: The hero image, again,
we're just gonna use the image tag,

58
00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:24.855
pretty bare bones,,
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: jpg, body copy,

59
00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:29.702
since it's gonna be a paragraph text,
we'll add a paragraph tag in

60
00:03:29.702 --> 00:03:34.818
there to make it semantic for
anybody that needs that additional help.

61
00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:36.210
The button,
I'm gonna get to a little bit later.

62
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.656
Right now we'll just put a link in there.

63
00:03:38.656 --> 00:03:45.313
We'll have it go to frontendmasters.com
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: I

64
00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:51.788
should probably mention that
these should be absolute URLs.

65
00:03:51.788 --> 00:03:57.105
you don't really wanna use relative
pads for the purposes of this.

66
00:03:57.105 --> 00:04:00.757
We're doing it for our images, but
when you're sending an email campaign and

67
00:04:00.757 --> 00:04:04.811
the client downloads it, it essentially
goes into a temporary directory somewhere.

68
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:08.797
So we don't really have this concept of
relative path, it's just dumped somewhere.

69
00:04:08.797 --> 00:04:11.106
We don't know where that happens to be.

70
00:04:11.106 --> 00:04:14.615
So if we're using something
like images/logo.jpad,

71
00:04:14.615 --> 00:04:19.146
we're hopefully not sending all those
images as attachments or as a ZIP or

72
00:04:19.146 --> 00:04:22.860
something that you expect
them to open up and extract.

73
00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.891
So we wanna make sure that we're using
those full URLs, not those just relative

74
00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:32.788
links, to make sure that those all
render properly, you're sending from.

75
00:04:32.788 --> 00:04:36.529
Especially with images you're sending
using a publicly accessible server,

76
00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:39.790
you don't have some weird read
rights restrictions on that.

77
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.522
So make sure all that works properly.

78
00:04:42.522 --> 00:04:43.437
For links,

79
00:04:43.437 --> 00:04:49.027
most email clients will generally
allow you to leave off that protocol.

80
00:04:49.027 --> 00:04:52.640
But it's nice to have it in there just for
peace of mind.

81
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.946
For anything that doesn't respect that,

82
00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:58.092
people will still be able to get
to where we want them to go.

83
00:04:58.092 --> 00:05:04.408
The footer down here, again,
we're gonna add in a paragraph.

84
00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:07.579
So you might wanna say,
Feel free to unsubscribe.

85
00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:13.833
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Let's make that
a link so they can actually do that.

86
00:05:15.414 --> 00:05:16.888
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: Just
use a placeholder here.

87
00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:25.498
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: And then usually,
you wanna add in your address too, so

88
00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:27.861
we'll just make something up.

89
00:05:37.122 --> 00:05:39.558
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: And then a lot
of times people use that photo for

90
00:05:39.558 --> 00:05:40.880
any legal disclaimers.

91
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.468
They'll have that view in
browser link down there.

92
00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:45.709
You might have a reminder.

93
00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:48.270
It's nice to remind people of
how they got on your list.

94
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.576
So before we do unsubscribe,
we can be like,

95
00:05:50.576 --> 00:05:53.689
you signed up because you wanna
learn more about HTML email.

96
00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.756
Or you showed interest in this product,
you're coming to our event, or

97
00:05:57.756 --> 00:05:59.034
something like that.

98
00:05:59.034 --> 00:06:00.519
But this is pretty basic.

99
00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:04.764
The one thing I did mention before we
started, that it's good to wrap all this

100
00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:09.030
content in some sort of container element
that we can do certain things with.

101
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.105
So I'm gonna grab all this and just
open up a div and dump it all in there.

102
00:06:15.105 --> 00:06:18.295
And we'll see where this div comes into
play in just a minute when we start

103
00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:19.930
talking about styling our content.

104
00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.797
Yeah, question?

105
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:25.756
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you usually, if there's
any logic around this, go one div deep,

106
00:06:25.756 --> 00:06:29.274
or would you ever wrap
the footer in a div as well?

107
00:06:29.274 --> 00:06:30.333
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: You totally could,
yeah.

108
00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:33.432
So a good example of that,
we could actually do that.

109
00:06:33.432 --> 00:06:35.790
And I think I might do
it later on in examples.

110
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.020
The footer is a good example of that,

111
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.480
cuz a lot of times you'll want to have
that smaller copy or something like that.

112
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.536
So when we start styling this,

113
00:06:45.536 --> 00:06:50.612
our divs are really to house the universal
styles for that content section.

114
00:06:50.612 --> 00:06:54.935
So for the main part of our email,
we'll see how we style things,

115
00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:57.300
the text styling for the most part.

116
00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.001
But since that footer tends to
be a separate little component,

117
00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:04.761
we'll house that in its own div too.

118
00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.846
So we'll just add that in there, and

119
00:07:06.846 --> 00:07:10.760
we can manipulate that bottom content
a little bit differently too.

120
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.182
That is a good point though, is, anytime
you need to do something wholesale to

121
00:07:15.182 --> 00:07:19.269
a section of content, then you can use
something like a div to wrap that.

122
00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:21.049
When we start talking about layouts, too,

123
00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:24.130
I'll talk a little bit about how
we should be building things.

124
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.188
Thinking modularly and
using modular components.

125
00:07:27.188 --> 00:07:31.090
And using things like divs or
table rows, table cells,

126
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.261
is a good way to do that, cool.

127
00:07:35.948 --> 00:07:39.436
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
we can say that, let's open it up, and

128
00:07:39.436 --> 00:07:42.430
nothing too great here.

129
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.991
We have a couple of images.

130
00:07:43.991 --> 00:07:45.418
My fun little avatar there.

131
00:07:45.418 --> 00:07:47.163
Our hero image.

132
00:07:47.163 --> 00:07:50.731
We can see our link down
here to unsubscribe.

133
00:07:50.731 --> 00:07:51.714
But nothing fancy.

134
00:07:51.714 --> 00:07:56.258
It looks like garbage right now
because we haven't done any styling.

135
00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:57.172
So that's kinda the next step.

136
00:07:57.172 --> 00:07:59.761
We have some basic HTML in here.

137
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:01.220
We haven't really introduced tables yet.

138
00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.258
We'll talk about that a little bit later
on when we start wanting to structure this

139
00:08:05.258 --> 00:08:06.201
a little bit more.

140
00:08:06.201 --> 00:08:09.563
But for the most part,
this is what you're going to be using,

141
00:08:09.563 --> 00:08:14.230
just simple HTML elements like the image
tag, like heading tags, like paragraphs.

142
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:18.756
If we wanted to target something
specific in here, that's where we would

143
00:08:18.756 --> 00:08:23.583
use something like the span tag or the m
tag, depending on what you need it for.

144
00:08:23.583 --> 00:08:25.372
I forgot to add some copy in here.

145
00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:30.410
&gt;&gt; Jason Rodriguez: So
let's show that link.

146
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.571
This is a link down here.

147
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:34.674
I've apparently already visited that link.

148
00:08:34.674 --> 00:08:36.204
So it's purple.

149
00:08:36.204 --> 00:08:39.942
And then our footer down here with all
the additional legal requirements,

150
00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:42.153
all that information
that we want in there.

151
00:08:42.153 --> 00:08:43.541
So nothing fancy going on.

152
00:08:43.541 --> 00:08:47.118
We'll get a little bit fancier when
we start manipulating the layout,

153
00:08:47.118 --> 00:08:51.180
introducing multiple columns, looking
at different responsive techniques.
