00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.200
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So let's go through and

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.610
add a button to our campaign
using this buttons.cm approach.

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.330
So we're going to hop
back over to code here.

4
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.646
We have this link that was kind
of a placeholder for our button.

5
00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:16.240
We want to style that and
make it look like call to action.

6
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.139
So we're going to hop over to buttons.cm.

7
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.140
And then we can update
whatever we want in here.

8
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.350
This is a button that's
not very descriptive but

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.960
we don't really have any
real content in here.

10
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.370
I'm not going to worry about a background
image, I like kinda that flat style.

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.460
If I want to I can update
the color on this.

12
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.020
Hopefully ensure that it's still
accessible, it has the high contrast

13
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.940
between the background color and
the color of the font.

14
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.060
We can make this a little bit
bigger like nice big buttons.

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.248
That's maybe a little bit too big.

16
00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:56.234
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Border radius is cool and
then add our URL in here.

17
00:00:59.528 --> 00:01:01.741
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So you can see that
button.cm they generate all that

18
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:03.160
code for you.

19
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.780
So you can go in here and
then just wholesale copy and

20
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.200
paste it to replace whatever
that URL happened to be.

21
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.390
Usually like to kind of format this a
little bit just so it's easier to read and

22
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.540
update if needed.

23
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.950
But it's just using that VML that
most people are not familiar with at

24
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.480
all and it's hard to kind
of come to terms with it so

25
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.688
that's why generators like buttons.cm
are so important and we save that.

26
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.740
Pop it back, open our browser here.

27
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.900
So you can see here after we add that in
there that it's not centering this button

28
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.990
but we might want it center looks a little
bit nicer kind of balances out the center

29
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.370
heading up there.

30
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.970
So on this container day of
we can apply inline style and

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.810
just use text align center for that.

32
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.730
I added a center button, which is awesome.

33
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.160
If we want to we can add some
additional spacing around the button,

34
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.180
give it a little bit of breathing room,
make it easier for people to click on.

35
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.850
The one thing I don't particularly like
about button.cm is that it tends to use

36
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.180
smaller font sizes but that's something
that's easy enough to go into

37
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.430
the Inline CSS for that tag and
update as needed to make

38
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.870
it a little bit more readable, a little
bit more usable for people that need it.
