&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: So
I want you to open up that starter email,

2
00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:08.048
let me know if you want to look at that
reset code again I added in there.

3
00:00:08.048 --> 00:00:11.260
But I want you to just
take a stab at adding some

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.637
content to that email document.

5
00:00:13.637 --> 00:00:17.376
I'll give you a hint that you should
probably use a div as a container for

6
00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:19.070
all of your content.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.865
And you can set some styles
there if you want to, but

8
00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:23.565
just add a couple of headings.

9
00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.780
Add an image in there, and
add some texts in there.

10
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.895
Whatever you wanna add in there,
it's placeholder's stuff use.

11
00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:34.573
Fill Murray for images,
placeholders, something like that.

12
00:00:34.573 --> 00:00:36.956
And yeah, we'll take maybe 5 or
10 minutes and

13
00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:39.236
I'll let you guys start
editing that content.

14
00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:43.248
And then we'll look at how I might add
some of that content and some of those got

15
00:00:43.248 --> 00:00:46.920
yous that you need to be aware of
when you're actually coding emails.
