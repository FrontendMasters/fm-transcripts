00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.298
&gt;&gt; Rodriguez: Email actually has a ton
of really good things going for it.

2
00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:07.041
Maybe the biggest one is that
pretty much everybody uses email.

3
00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:11.816
3.9 billion email users in
2019 which will blow out

4
00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:16.111
pretty much any app or
social network, that usage.

5
00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:19.275
So everybody's literally in
the inbox pretty much all the time.

6
00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.769
People spend two and
a half hours per week day in their inbox.

7
00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.283
One of the greatest things is that email
generates a huge return on investment.

8
00:00:28.283 --> 00:00:33.007
So most marketing channels hover
around 5 to $10 for return.

9
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.069
Email is usually between $38 and $42 for

10
00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:40.083
every dollar spent on an email campaign,
which is amazing.

11
00:00:40.083 --> 00:00:44.722
That's gonna blow out any other digital
marketing channel out of the water.

12
00:00:44.722 --> 00:00:49.640
So I like to remind people that
email is the farthest thing from

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.638
being dead as possible.

14
00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:55.536
We always see those blog posts, we always
see people talking about the death of

15
00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:59.510
email in favor of negative advertising,
social apps, all that kind of stuff.

16
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.941
But email is not going
anywhere anytime soon.

17
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:05.023
It's not gonna be replaced.

18
00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.759
All those different apps you use,
all those social networks,

19
00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.093
they all require an email
address to sign up for them.

20
00:01:10.093 --> 00:01:14.414
So I like to think of the inbox as
kinda like the holy place online,

21
00:01:14.414 --> 00:01:17.178
that's people's kinda personal home.

22
00:01:17.178 --> 00:01:20.187
So you have to think about that when
you start sending them email campaigns.

23
00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:24.219
And avoid things like spamming messages,
like and

24
00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.804
all those 180 billion other spam
messages that are sent everyday.

25
00:01:28.804 --> 00:01:33.252
So you have to think about how you want to
create that connection to subscribers and

26
00:01:33.252 --> 00:01:35.261
make your emails valuable for them.

27
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.174
One way to do that is through design
development which is what we're gonna be

28
00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:39.047
talking about today.

29
00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:43.788
Email, four of my favorite things
about email, the first one is that

30
00:01:43.788 --> 00:01:48.475
email is pretty damn easy to send and
it's relatively affordable.

31
00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:52.872
You don't need a lot of technology
to send an email campaign.

32
00:01:52.872 --> 00:01:56.940
There's a ton of different companies
that allow you to quickly code up or

33
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.739
use a WYSIWYG editor to
create an email campaign,

34
00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:01.822
send it out to a list of subscribers.

35
00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:04.321
And then you can track those campaigns.

36
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:06.029
You can track most things
in an email campaign.

37
00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:09.843
You can see how long people
are actually engaging with your email.

38
00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:12.709
You can see what they're clicking on,
where their areas of interest are,

39
00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.769
how they're interacting
with that email campaign.

40
00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:20.426
So that means that testing emails
is super, super quick and easy.

41
00:02:20.426 --> 00:02:22.631
The fact that we can send things so
quickly.

42
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:25.767
We can design something one day and
send it the next day.

43
00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:28.928
And we can track everything that's
happening with that campaign,

44
00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:30.433
allows us to test assumptions.

45
00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:34.155
Do experiments in our email campaigns
to figure out what's working for

46
00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:37.951
our subscribers and for our companies
a lot faster than other channels.

47
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:43.397
You might spend weeks, months, years
creating a newly designed website for

48
00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:47.438
your company, creating new features for
your product.

49
00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:51.015
Then it's gonna take a long time to
get that feedback on that product

50
00:02:51.015 --> 00:02:54.682
to figure out what's working and
not working wnd then iterate on it.

51
00:02:54.682 --> 00:02:58.859
With email, you can do stuff
in a very short time period.

52
00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.621
You can make an assumption, have some
sort of hypothesis you want to test,

53
00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:06.644
send a campaign, and
within a matter of hours,

54
00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:11.430
if not minutes, then you can see
what's working and what's not working.

55
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.022
Perhaps my favorite thing about
email is that it's completely and

56
00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:16.311
utterly forgettable.

57
00:03:16.311 --> 00:03:19.006
Nobody remembers their
favorite email campaign or

58
00:03:19.006 --> 00:03:21.394
something that just
really pissed them off.

59
00:03:21.394 --> 00:03:25.500
It's very rare for people to get super
worked up about email campaigns unless

60
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.657
something goes really, really wrong.

61
00:03:27.657 --> 00:03:30.705
So it's nice that email's forgettable,
sucks for posterity.

62
00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:36.677
We don't have this kinda public record of
these great email campaigns we've sent.

63
00:03:36.677 --> 00:03:38.229
There are cool places out there,

64
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.454
reallygoodemails.com that collect
really cool email campaigns.

65
00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:46.393
But there's nothing like
the webarchive.org, or whatever it is,

66
00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:51.514
collecting our history as email can,
email marketers and designers.

67
00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:55.638
But that's cool that things are
forgettable because we all do things wrong

68
00:03:55.638 --> 00:03:56.235
in email.

69
00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.283
Things will always break
in an email campaign.

70
00:03:58.283 --> 00:04:01.855
Whether that's sending to
the wrong subscriber list,

71
00:04:01.855 --> 00:04:07.023
you forgot to take out some placeholder
copy, your merge tags aren't working so

72
00:04:07.023 --> 00:04:10.761
people see hello first name
instead of their actual name.

73
00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:13.918
Having broken links,
having broken designs and

74
00:04:13.918 --> 00:04:18.629
layouts, even when those things happen,
we can quickly correct them.

75
00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.527
We can send an apology
email if you need to.

76
00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:25.914
We can send another campaign the next day
and people forget about it really easily.

77
00:04:25.914 --> 00:04:28.074
So our mistakes are pretty
easy to overcome, and

78
00:04:28.074 --> 00:04:31.461
that's a good thing because there's
a lot of mistakes in email marketing.

79
00:04:31.461 --> 00:04:32.645
There's a lot of things that can go wrong.

80
00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:37.133
So it's nice to be able to
correct those things, and

81
00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:40.603
then move on to the next email campaign.

82
00:04:40.603 --> 00:04:42.738
This is some research we did at Litmus.

83
00:04:42.738 --> 00:04:46.750
We tracked a couple of months in 2019,
three months.

84
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.954
And we looked at four different popular
email clients so the Gmail apps on iOS and

85
00:04:51.954 --> 00:04:55.929
Android and then the Outlook
apps on iOS and Android as well.

86
00:04:55.929 --> 00:04:58.970
We found that over that
three month period,

87
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.655
there were something around 45 different
updates to those four email clients.

88
00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:08.601
So all of those updates are potentially
things that can break our email campaigns.

89
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:12.302
And this is something that people
aren't usually aware of that all these

90
00:05:12.302 --> 00:05:14.980
different email clients
are constantly changing.

91
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.614
They're always pushing updates.

92
00:05:16.614 --> 00:05:18.039
Well, modern ones at least,

93
00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.579
are always pushing updates that could
potentially break our HTML or CSS.

94
00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:24.814
So that's something we wanna be aware of.

95
00:05:24.814 --> 00:05:28.493
So a lot of email development is really
about kind of coding defensively.

96
00:05:28.493 --> 00:05:32.195
And making sure you know what works where,
what doesn't work where,

97
00:05:32.195 --> 00:05:35.331
testing your email campaigns on
a regular basis to make sure

98
00:05:35.331 --> 00:05:37.667
these updates don't break our campaigns.

99
00:05:37.667 --> 00:05:41.940
And just get in that defensive mindset to
make sure that your emails aren't breaking

100
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.323
and all these different email campaigns or
email clients rather.

101
00:05:45.323 --> 00:05:47.713
But yeah, email's awesome.

102
00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:51.478
I hope everybody kind of understands
this that no one really owns email.

103
00:05:51.478 --> 00:05:54.065
It's this open protocol out there,

104
00:05:54.065 --> 00:05:59.663
anybody can build an email app with
minimal headaches, I guess, as some TP is.

105
00:05:59.663 --> 00:06:05.220
Sometimes a little finicky implementing
iMap is hard to do, but it's open.

106
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.029
It's open technology that anybody can use.

107
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:11.811
Everybody uses email to some extent, it's
completely universal, it's ubiquitous,

108
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:12.906
it's everywhere.

109
00:06:12.906 --> 00:06:16.207
And perhaps, most importantly,
for people that are working for

110
00:06:16.207 --> 00:06:20.167
companies using email, it makes a lot
of money with fairly limited investment

111
00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:22.040
which is a good thing to keep in mind.
