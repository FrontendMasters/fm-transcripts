00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:03.158
What if we don't wanna
fetch isomorphic li we want

2
00:00:03.158 --> 00:00:05.379
this always to happen on the server?

3
00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:10.326
And for that reason we came up something
we like to call server functions.

4
00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:11.819
And server functions,

5
00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:16.449
denoted by this dollar sign cuz they're
kind of like a compiler trick, or

6
00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.838
our ability to basically make RPC calls,
anywhere that's remote procedure calls.

7
00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:27.869
So we can do something
like pretend like a hello,

8
00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.163
let's say, and we can go wrap a function,

9
00:00:33.163 --> 00:00:39.065
an a sync function here like this,
and this code

10
00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.149
Will only run on the server.

11
00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.872
What I mean by that is,
I could take this hello here, and

12
00:00:49.872 --> 00:00:53.604
let's say, call it inside our route data.

13
00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:58.195
And we see hello from the server, and

14
00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:06.356
if we look at our client app when
we refresh our page, essentially

15
00:01:08.353 --> 00:01:12.470
We're not actually gonna see it here,
okay?

16
00:01:20.797 --> 00:01:22.048
Beautiful, okay?

17
00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:27.184
Now, what's really cool about this though,

18
00:01:27.184 --> 00:01:30.111
is pretend we actually
wanna parameterize it.

19
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:34.048
We wanna add some arguments here,
like a name.

20
00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:36.536
Well, you saw what happened
in this immediately.

21
00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:40.761
Hello is, hey, I'm expecting one argument,
not zero arguments.

22
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:45.194
Using server calls allow us to be
keep types as well as typesafe as we

23
00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:47.022
can across this boundary.

24
00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:51.621
So if I try and pass it like zero,
it's gonna be like, nope, not a number,

25
00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:52.801
we wanna a string.

26
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:58.215
And essentially, we have this ability to
kind of type our arguments anywhere and

27
00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:02.131
do these functions that literally
just run on the server.

28
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:05.373
And this is really powerful because,

29
00:02:05.373 --> 00:02:10.147
it means we can do stuff like,
we can say this fetch API.

30
00:02:10.147 --> 00:02:15.129
If I always wanna it to run on the server,
well, I could always run it on

31
00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.955
the server and now it's that could
be a database call, or whatnot.

32
00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:25.554
So when I run this in dev now what
you're gonna see, is that yes,

33
00:02:25.554 --> 00:02:30.143
the initial page always
runs on the server anyways.

34
00:02:30.143 --> 00:02:33.879
But now when we navigate, what you're
gonna see is instead of hitting

35
00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.823
the specific endpoint the hacker news
endpoint I was looking at earlier.

36
00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:42.619
We're actually hitting our own local
server with this kind of trumped up

37
00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:43.335
URL here.

38
00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:44.717
And that's kind of the power here,

39
00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:47.541
with server functions you can have as
many as you want, in the same file.

40
00:02:47.541 --> 00:02:49.925
And we generate a URL in the background,
and

41
00:02:49.925 --> 00:02:52.644
you don't worry about
that wiring essentially.

42
00:02:52.644 --> 00:02:57.173
So, the server function itself,
has a dot URL on it, if you need that for

43
00:02:57.173 --> 00:02:58.673
the API you're using.

44
00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:03.868
But generally speaking we
can use server functions

45
00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:11.377
to basically declare as many route
fetches or actions as we want in a file.

46
00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:16.642
So this a little clunky so
to make our lives a little bit

47
00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:23.077
easier solid state actually has
this as a kind of first class API,

48
00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:30.574
instead of create resource if you go
create route or server data let's see.

49
00:03:30.574 --> 00:03:34.957
No, not that let's import it, and

50
00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:41.389
it simplifies things a little bit and
essentially,

51
00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:47.108
let's get here from this
create server data.

52
00:03:51.025 --> 00:03:57.687
And swap over All right?

53
00:04:00.913 --> 00:04:08.044
All right, sorry API's updated slightly.

54
00:04:08.044 --> 00:04:11.559
We can pass into our the first argument
to a server function as always the server

55
00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.914
function to make sure that it runs on
the client that's what the dollar sign

56
00:04:14.914 --> 00:04:15.836
convention means.

57
00:04:15.836 --> 00:04:22.328
So we just need to set this as our key,
and

58
00:04:24.583 --> 00:04:30.550
Now We have the same
kind of working API and

59
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.183
it's a little bit slimmed
down it makes it easier.

60
00:04:33.183 --> 00:04:38.272
So quite often with a lot of these
kind of a lot of loader type function

61
00:04:38.272 --> 00:04:43.811
scenarios where you're just doing all
your data fetching on the client,

62
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.680
you're just gonna kind of go in here and
go, okay?

63
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.795
It's a kind of doing this song and
dance where there's

64
00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:57.910
a whole bunch of extra
features from create resource,

65
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.923
you can simply just go create server data.

66
00:05:01.923 --> 00:05:06.820
And then just return this and
essentially we can set our

67
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.304
key to this and
assuming that it imported import.

68
00:05:11.304 --> 00:05:18.830
Create server data from solid start,

69
00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.708
slash server, we now have for

70
00:05:24.708 --> 00:05:30.586
our stories route as as well,

71
00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:37.889
the same sort of API consideration.

72
00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.683
Here, okay?

73
00:05:40.683 --> 00:05:46.260
So this pattern allows you to basically
co locate database queries and

74
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.622
whatnot and
it all works with transitions and suspense
