00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.645
Spreads are a way that we can dynamically
add multiple properties from an object.

2
00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:09.709
Maybe those properties change and
pass them down through our children.

3
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.281
And it also has a convenience
factor cuz sure,

4
00:00:13.281 --> 00:00:17.777
we could pass each of these
things individually, right?

5
00:00:17.777 --> 00:00:21.464
And to be fair, this can be more
optimized because we can impact each

6
00:00:21.464 --> 00:00:23.611
change independently when we do that.

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.708
But sometimes, we don't know all
the variables that are gonna come through.

8
00:00:27.708 --> 00:00:35.478
So in those cases, it's easier
sometimes to just use the syntax and

9
00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:39.992
we get the same result of our info here.

10
00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:45.886
And our info components literally
just taking these props and

11
00:00:45.886 --> 00:00:48.952
just writing us a nice message.

12
00:00:51.362 --> 00:00:55.409
The thing that always
remember what spreads is,

13
00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.280
they work as this great in the GSX.

14
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.382
But we have to remember that once more
we're passing stuffs to those spreads

15
00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:06.805
merging objects to use those helpers that
we showed earlier to make sure you don't

16
00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:07.853
lose reactivity.

17
00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:12.349
And the last binding syntax,
this one doesn't come out too often.

18
00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:17.317
But it is an interesting addition
that we added to the GSX language.

19
00:01:17.317 --> 00:01:21.811
Refs are great, but
sometimes you wanna package

20
00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:25.324
up more advanced behavior with them.

21
00:01:25.324 --> 00:01:30.708
And the way we can do that is
something we call a directive and

22
00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:38.043
some frameworks like felt call them
actions and angular calls them directives.

23
00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:39.977
I can't remember what view calls them.

24
00:01:39.977 --> 00:01:46.279
But essentially, we have this ability
to kind of add some custom DOM logic.

25
00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:51.556
So let's say on this modal class, we
wanted it to have click outside behavior.

26
00:01:51.556 --> 00:01:53.180
You wanted to add this behavior so

27
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.791
that it closed whenever you
click outside the modal.

28
00:01:55.791 --> 00:01:59.352
Well, we can define that here, right?

29
00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:03.876
And this is where we basically
implement that click outside logic.

30
00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:10.183
And the way we do this is creating
this function that has a signature.

31
00:02:10.183 --> 00:02:12.458
It takes the element and
it takes an accessor.

32
00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:17.636
And essentially, let's think here.

33
00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:19.020
If we wanna click outside,

34
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.527
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
make some kind of click handler.

35
00:02:22.527 --> 00:02:26.807
And we can do this by
essentially checking if

36
00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:31.558
the element contains the event target,
right?

37
00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:39.874
So, and it's a, Right, and
we actually are gonna give the ability for

38
00:02:39.874 --> 00:02:42.584
our click outside to be enabled
to be toggled on and off.

39
00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:46.546
So we're also gonna check if our
accessor which is a function,

40
00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:48.955
it's always a function regardless.

41
00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:56.710
Sorry, it's writing off the side of
the screen here, is has a truthy value.

42
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.173
And then if there's a click handler here,
we're going to.

43
00:03:01.173 --> 00:03:06.354
On our document.body, add an event

44
00:03:06.354 --> 00:03:13.717
listener to the click that
uses this click handler.

45
00:03:13.717 --> 00:03:17.757
It's also important that we
clean up after ourselves here.

46
00:03:17.757 --> 00:03:21.596
So we're also going to add in on cleanup.

47
00:03:21.596 --> 00:03:25.940
Again, because this is all
part of solid rendering,

48
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.511
we can do this anywhere and
we're gonna go,

49
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:35.027
we're gonna remove our event listener
that we just added on click.

50
00:03:35.027 --> 00:03:39.546
And this is basically our direct
that we just wrapped up some simple

51
00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:41.170
JavaScript behavior.

52
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.351
Then, here, we import our function.

53
00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:52.310
We go to our div and go use colon.

54
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.885
So this is namespace thing,
click or is it click outside?

55
00:03:57.885 --> 00:04:02.017
And by default, it's a Boolean,
so this will just work.

56
00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:08.253
But we can also for
implementation here, toggle it.

57
00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:13.779
So that we're only managing it
when the modal is visible, right?

58
00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:17.816
And set show to false.

59
00:04:17.816 --> 00:04:20.539
And if everything works properly,
we're gonna have a modal.

60
00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.635
Clicking in, it's fine, but
when we click out of it, sorry.

61
00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:31.428
If we click out of it, okay, we can there.

62
00:04:31.428 --> 00:04:34.273
Typo, my bad.

63
00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.586
Contains, isn't it?

64
00:04:35.586 --> 00:04:39.022
Yeah, there's an S, there we go.

65
00:04:39.022 --> 00:04:41.221
We open it, click in it, nothing happens.

66
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:45.896
We click out of it and
we get another error.

67
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:55.357
Cuz I forgot to put click on the click
handler, beautiful, all right.

68
00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:58.579
This is in clicking,
fine, click out, close.

69
00:04:58.579 --> 00:05:01.345
And we basically have
basic modal behavior,

70
00:05:01.345 --> 00:05:05.948
that we can add to really any DOM element
by just including this directive.

71
00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:11.424
So as I said, it's just syntactic
sugar over ref, but it's kind

72
00:05:11.424 --> 00:05:18.016
of a nice convenience to be able to kind
of packaged up these behaviors as well.

73
00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:19.572
We've seen a lot of this usage and

74
00:05:19.572 --> 00:05:23.131
things like custom form libraries where
they'll have some custom hooks and

75
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:26.928
then they'll have some custom directives
and it kind of like all ties together.

76
00:05:26.928 --> 00:05:33.225
So there's a lot we can do
with the GSX language, right?

77
00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:40.645
And that is basically it for
the specific syntaxes.
