1
00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.430
What else we need, to do,
is we need to find, our ability to,

2
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.550
add it to do that's probably
the easiest place to start.

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.930
So, in order to add it to do,

4
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:19.135
we're gonna add an event to our input and

5
00:00:19.135 --> 00:00:25.532
interestingly enough to do MVC example.

6
00:00:25.532 --> 00:00:29.915
I mean,
we could just use one of the on blur,

7
00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:34.309
on change events, actually, typically.

8
00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.210
But to do MVC actually has more
functionality built into it,

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.668
whether we'll get all the way there.

10
00:00:40.668 --> 00:00:46.205
So we're actually going to,
for now I guess we'll we'll

11
00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:52.081
use a blur event we can change it
let's go later if we need to but

12
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:58.303
this input here I'm actually
gonna use onChange specifically.

13
00:00:58.303 --> 00:01:01.678
Some developers coming from
certain frameworks have

14
00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:04.607
completely mangled
the meaning of onChange.

15
00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:11.444
OnChange is an event that only
fires when the focus is blurred,

16
00:01:11.444 --> 00:01:16.090
lost from the element when it's changed.

17
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.812
If it hasn't changed, it won't fire, and
it only fires when you leave the element.

18
00:01:20.812 --> 00:01:24.745
So there's another native DOM event called
on input that happens whenever the key

19
00:01:24.745 --> 00:01:25.661
presses strokes.

20
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:30.186
But there are some other certain
frameworks and different conventions here.

21
00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:32.586
Even though the way the actual DOM works.

22
00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:34.989
The change event only fires when
you actually leave the elements.

23
00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:39.597
So it's important to know this and
for our to do example,

24
00:01:39.597 --> 00:01:44.685
we don't actually care that every
keystroke triggers an event

25
00:01:44.685 --> 00:01:49.103
we only care when we actually,
leave it, so to speak.

26
00:01:49.103 --> 00:01:51.055
Actually, after giving that spiel,

27
00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:54.847
I've decided I'm just gonna go with
keydown anyways just because I can.

28
00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:58.763
So, disregard that anyways, or
don't disregard it remember that, but

29
00:01:58.763 --> 00:02:00.721
we're gonna do onKeyDown anyways,

30
00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:04.590
because I'm gonna keep it closer to
the actual real to do some examples.

31
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.725
So we're gonna make an addTodo function.

32
00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:07.714
Okay?

33
00:02:07.714 --> 00:02:10.345
Okay onKeyDown we're gonna have to do but

34
00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:15.081
I just wanted to point that that one
out there it's one of those interesting

35
00:02:15.081 --> 00:02:18.256
differences that people
tend to get caught up on.

36
00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:24.440
So how do we add it to do well,
we're gonna make a function to addTodo and

37
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.573
our Todo function is essentially going to
let's think of the best way to put this.

38
00:02:31.573 --> 00:02:33.786
We're just gonna push
the item onto the list.

39
00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:37.774
What we'll have is we're
gonna have an event, right?

40
00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:42.027
And our event is gonna have
a target with some text on it,

41
00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.572
which is gonna be from our input.

42
00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:47.055
So we're gonna go,
let's get the title first.

43
00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:53.867
So it's gonna be like
event.target.value and

44
00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:58.020
we're actually gonna trim it

45
00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.838
because we don't need empty space

46
00:03:02.838 --> 00:03:07.654
on the ends of our to Todos right and

47
00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:13.469
essentially if the event.keyCode now,

48
00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.646
this is the enter key.

49
00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:20.335
This will be relevant later but
if it's the enter key and

50
00:03:20.335 --> 00:03:23.318
there is a title I'll
give you the keyCode for

51
00:03:23.318 --> 00:03:27.732
enter in just a moment then we're
gonna update some stuff okay so.

52
00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:29.003
Up at the top here,

53
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:33.777
I'm gonna just will add a couple
keyCodes here that will come in later.

54
00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:38.563
If you've ever implemented
to do MVC specifically you

55
00:03:38.563 --> 00:03:42.411
will have hit this before but
we're gonna so

56
00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:48.252
we're gonna do this ENTER_KEY and
we're gonna do ESCAPE_KEY.

57
00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:51.944
This is important when we add
editing functionality a bit later.

58
00:03:51.944 --> 00:03:55.540
But let's see here.

59
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.320
So ENTER_KEY ESCAPE_ KEY.

60
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.190
And so if there is a title and
the person clicked enter,

61
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.144
then we need to add it and in our case,

62
00:04:08.144 --> 00:04:13.904
we're gonna do something
fairly straightforward.

63
00:04:13.904 --> 00:04:18.520
We're gonna say setTodos and
then we haven't covered this yet

64
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.788
on our signals because we've
been just setting a value but

65
00:04:22.788 --> 00:04:26.206
our signals actually
take a functional form.

66
00:04:26.206 --> 00:04:30.374
So what we can do is we can
get the current todos and

67
00:04:30.374 --> 00:04:35.154
parse like a function form in
like this and actually go,

68
00:04:35.154 --> 00:04:40.138
actually we wanna take the current todos,
copy them, and

69
00:04:40.138 --> 00:04:44.102
then add a new todo to the end,
which has an id,

70
00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:47.994
which is our counter plus plus, let's say.

71
00:04:47.994 --> 00:04:55.054
And, completed:false.

72
00:04:55.054 --> 00:05:01.116
And we'll add, the title will be
just the title that we just had.

73
00:05:01.116 --> 00:05:03.664
So see if this all things yeah so

74
00:05:03.664 --> 00:05:08.173
setTodos current todos return
an array spread it in and

75
00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:13.857
then add the new todos to the end sorry
let me keep that on the screen for

76
00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:18.094
a second so
make sure everyone everyone's got that

77
00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:27.726
I'm actually gonna remove
this todo here for a moment.

78
00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:33.524
And if everything is still building okay,

79
00:05:33.524 --> 00:05:37.394
we have some stuff going on.

80
00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:39.410
If I type something and click enter,

81
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.130
of course you can see there's
already a couple problems with this.

82
00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.617
I'm not clearing the input
after each one and

83
00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:50.760
it just keeps on adding as
many as I want here, right?

84
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.763
So what we're gonna do,
in addition to setting those

85
00:05:55.763 --> 00:06:01.433
todos we're gonna need to actually
handle our title a little

86
00:06:01.433 --> 00:06:06.548
bit differently we're or
actually not differently so

87
00:06:06.548 --> 00:06:11.328
not yet what we need to do
actually simply just clear

88
00:06:11.328 --> 00:06:16.135
the title from our event,
target, essentially.

89
00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:20.714
So target.value="".

90
00:06:20.714 --> 00:06:21.687
All right.

91
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:28.840
Internal Server Error, fun.

92
00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:35.334
See if that actually,
it's cuz I put in the wrong spot.

93
00:06:35.334 --> 00:06:41.281
We only need to clear the title if
it actually is in the if statement.

94
00:06:41.281 --> 00:06:45.608
So now this should basically working,

95
00:06:45.608 --> 00:06:49.548
so what do we have, learn SolidJS.

96
00:06:49.548 --> 00:06:52.665
Do something else, okay?

97
00:06:52.665 --> 00:06:57.610
So now we have this but
it's not completely working

98
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.980
because we need to actually
do some stuffs for

99
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.845
at least when we're checking
stuffs it's not completing,

100
00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:11.534
when have no other functionalities.
