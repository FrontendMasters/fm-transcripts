1
00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:04.777
Those topologies, those models they can
learn a lot of things by just gonna

2
00:00:04.777 --> 00:00:07.465
doing that propagation, this training.

3
00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:14.352
And it's gonna now next level how you take
those models and do something with them.

4
00:00:14.352 --> 00:00:18.404
For instance,
another interesting example is

5
00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:22.263
combination of different neural networks.

6
00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:27.113
For instance, you can have convolutional
neural network, which is used for

7
00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:31.143
processing images and
some type of recurrent neural networks,

8
00:00:31.143 --> 00:00:34.665
which are used for data series,
for instance, sound.

9
00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:38.704
Waveform, right, is just the amplitudes or

10
00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:44.339
kinda change in pressure if we're
talking physics in the air,

11
00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.608
but it can be just record
it as your data series.

12
00:00:48.608 --> 00:00:54.096
You can do the prediction using
convolutional neural network

13
00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:59.173
to basically see what is you're
looking at on the image.

14
00:00:59.173 --> 00:01:03.631
And with select indications, you can even
predict the location of those objects.

15
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.637
With RNN, so you can simply analyze text.

16
00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:10.760
And combining those together
by mixing them together,

17
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.969
what you can do,
you can actually create the smart system

18
00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:19.544
which will analyze the question
pretty used by user, right?

19
00:01:19.544 --> 00:01:24.208
So for instance just some
question can be fit into RNN.

20
00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:29.457
And our model, so in this case,
this model now is the combination

21
00:01:29.457 --> 00:01:33.951
of those simpler models,
can try to give you an answer.

22
00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:41.518
So for instance you can ask what
color of the house I'm looking at.

23
00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:46.206
And CNN will analyze the image,
will locate the house and

24
00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.235
will actually even find the color and

25
00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:53.640
the answer will be blue or
brown, [LAUGH] or whatever.

26
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.182
So you can kind of combine now
those parts and pieces and

27
00:01:57.182 --> 00:01:59.191
the training will be similar.

28
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:04.601
You will need to provide a lot of
questions, corresponding images and

29
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:10.210
corresponding answer, what your model
shoots give you as the results.

30
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.098
So for instance, in the example I've used,

31
00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:16.295
it will just tell you blue,
something like that.

32
00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:23.128
And with backpropagation, you will
retrain convolutional neural networks and

33
00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:28.152
recurrent neural networks on
the scan aggregator to figure

34
00:02:28.152 --> 00:02:33.085
out what should be the answers
depending on the question.

35
00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.430
So you can combine those parts and pieces.

36
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.543
And for me,
that is what I probably gonna call AI.

37
00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:42.030
So, yes.

38
00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.841
&gt;&gt; So are these two different models and

39
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:48.468
are they specializing in different-
&gt;&gt; Types of data?

40
00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.027
&gt;&gt; Types of data?

41
00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:49.797
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

42
00:02:49.797 --> 00:02:55.189
&gt;&gt; So then could you have a model
that let's say visualizes or

43
00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.816
can see, take camera and
then a model that processes sound?

44
00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:01.582
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.

45
00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:06.020
&gt;&gt; Like your eyes and your ears and
another model that processes temperature.

46
00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.683
&gt;&gt; Yes, so I put question here as
the text but it can be sounds.

47
00:03:11.683 --> 00:03:15.124
Sound will be processed by
recurrent neural networks

48
00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:20.053
You just need to have
tons of training data.

49
00:03:20.053 --> 00:03:23.385
So it means that, for
instance for this system, but

50
00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:25.443
then what should be our output?

51
00:03:25.443 --> 00:03:29.528
What do we want to predict?

52
00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:34.337
&gt;&gt; So let's say we're out in the world and
we have hardware that

53
00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:38.954
can pull in that data and
feed it in real time to the models,

54
00:03:38.954 --> 00:03:44.615
could predict whether that thing
there's a duck based on the sounds and

55
00:03:44.615 --> 00:03:46.135
the-
&gt;&gt; Just the label but

56
00:03:46.135 --> 00:03:47.967
then you don't need the sound.

57
00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:53.590
Although, yes if you wants
to have almost like a system

58
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.971
which will use additional
source of information and

59
00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:04.120
in this case, sound as well,
yes, absolutely.

60
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.368
But I'm just saying that your system
at the end will just produce the label,

61
00:04:09.368 --> 00:04:12.823
right, if we're looking at the dark or
not dark.

62
00:04:12.823 --> 00:04:16.184
But you can do so much more.

63
00:04:16.184 --> 00:04:20.353
So as I said, [LAUGH] no,
I'm not talking about shooting the duck,

64
00:04:20.353 --> 00:04:24.083
we're not talking about
automated robots killing stuff.

65
00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:29.946
It is possible but
I'm against it, completely.

66
00:04:29.946 --> 00:04:33.206
Yeah, it's also deregulated, okay?

67
00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:39.436
But the thing is, yes,
with all of those building blocks,

68
00:04:39.436 --> 00:04:44.682
you can almost mimic or
replicate intelligence.

69
00:04:44.682 --> 00:04:49.372
So answering questions,
it's somehow in my brain,

70
00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:53.554
at least,
associated with the intelligence.

71
00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:57.659
If you can answer my question,
it means that he knows something, right?

72
00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.009
And this knowledge, understanding
what first of all I'm asking you,

73
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.909
and providing the answer yet behind
the scenes it's just weights and biases.

74
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.709
But at the same time,
those models starts, for instance,

75
00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:14.690
with text that I will show you.

76
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.294
Somehow by still modifying with
just those weights and biases,

77
00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:25.701
figuring out the relationship
between objects in our world.

78
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:30.649
So in word embedding, for
instance, that's the trick used.

79
00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:35.985
If you kinda visualize this
multi dimensional space,

80
00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:41.553
the distance and
kinda the direction between two words,

81
00:05:41.553 --> 00:05:45.845
let's say, man and boy,
will be the same as

82
00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:51.416
the direction between, for
instance, woman and girl.

83
00:05:53.912 --> 00:05:58.329
And just because the alignment,
so somehow and

84
00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:03.528
once again,
there are gonna be pretty cool demo there.

85
00:06:03.528 --> 00:06:08.833
Our system figuring out their relationship
between different objects and

86
00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:12.633
it's learning by itself just
by looking at the text.

87
00:06:12.633 --> 00:06:16.309
So yes, for me that's AI,
the combination of multiple kind

88
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:20.216
of building blocks originally more or
less kinda simple ideas.

89
00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:24.370
But now you can create something
really incredible out of it.
