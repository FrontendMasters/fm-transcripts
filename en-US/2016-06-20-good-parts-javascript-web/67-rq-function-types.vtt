00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:06.990
&gt;&gt; Douglas: RQ has four types of
functions in it and if you can manage

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.750
these four types of functions then
it's it's pretty easy to use.

4
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.210
We have requestor functions, which
are functions that can execute a request.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.120
We've got callbacks, which are
continuation functions that are passed to

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.300
requestors that's how
requester returns its result.

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.780
We have factories, which are like
the factories you've been making which

8
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.735
make requestor functions,
they act as a convenience.

9
00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.492
And in fact the four functions that
I've shown you are all factories and

10
00:00:37.492 --> 00:00:41.499
then cancel functions that cancel can
be returned by a requestor to cancel or

11
00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:42.070
request.

12
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.250
A callback function takes two parameters,

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.750
a success parameter and
a failure parameters.

14
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.600
If success is undefined then it fails and

15
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.700
the failure is undefined when it succeeds
and there's just one callback in

16
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.210
promises for example will be two callbacks
one for success, one for failure.

17
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.890
I think it's easier if you just have one.

18
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.060
Than a requester function will take a call
back and it can optionally also take

19
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.150
a value and that's how a sequence will
move results from one step to the next.

20
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.870
A requestor function can return
a cancel function which is used for

21
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.369
cancellation and
factories make requestors.

22
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.078
That's the relationship of
the four kinds of functions.

23
00:01:32.716 --> 00:01:35.090
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Let's look at an example.

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.520
This is the identity requestor this is
the simplest possible requestor It will

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.690
receive a value and it will then send the
value to the next thing in the sequence.

26
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.930
If you put this in the middle of
a sequence, it's a do nothing it

27
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.610
will just take whatever's going on and
give it to the next one.

28
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.962
You never do that but
this is the model for the simplest form.

29
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.906
&gt;&gt; Douglas: We can wrap those things or,
I'm sorry, this is the fullname request

30
00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:18.679
this one receives an object containing
parts of names and we'll concatenate

31
00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:23.680
them together to make a name and
then deliver that to the callback.

32
00:02:25.254 --> 00:02:27.700
I could add this as a processing step for
example.

33
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.370
And we can write functions
which will automate that for

34
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.490
us, so request arise is similar to
functions that you've been writing.

35
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.660
It will produce a requestor that
will call some ordinary function.

36
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.293
We can take any existing function and
turn it into a requestor which could

37
00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:56.077
reduce the amount of work you
have to do in transiting to RQ.

38
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.190
&gt;&gt; Douglas: This is a Delay Requestor.

39
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.040
This is the simplest real time thing.

40
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.450
You would never put a delay
into a server application.

41
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.910
What you would do in a real situation is
instead of calling setTimeout, you're

42
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.980
going to send a message to some service
and instead of calling clearTimeout

43
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.240
you would send a message probably to the
same service telling it to please stop.

44
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.330
You just make the substitution but if
you were to take the delay requestor and

45
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.380
put it in a sequence, the sequence will
run exactly the same it will just take

46
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.290
longer but
it will take longer without blocking.

47
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.830
If then this is the Delay Factory.

48
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.060
It's this code is
the delay requestor except

49
00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.600
the factory is providing
the milliseconds value.

50
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.418
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: These are all part of RQ?

51
00:03:52.418 --> 00:03:54.593
&gt;&gt; Douglas: No these are examples
of how you could use RQ.

52
00:03:54.593 --> 00:03:57.406
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Things that
you put in there okay.

53
00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:58.422
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Now know that this code is.

54
00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:02.108
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Request.

55
00:04:06.234 --> 00:04:10.770
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Then this is a factory for
reading files.

56
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.290
This factory will produce
a requestor which you can then

57
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.020
put in a list which will
then read files for you and

58
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.520
this one is wrapping the node file system.

59
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.830
This is the widget that was in
the demo that I showed you earlier.

60
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.140
This is all HTML crap, so
I'm not gonna bother you with that but

61
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.090
and I did it this way cause I didn't
want to have to depend on any one

62
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.190
library because if I chose a library
that's not everybody's favorite, and

63
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:49.320
it turns out everybody is
not somebody's favorite so

64
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.960
it's just, so it's awful.

65
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.565
But the interesting features here
are that this is the quick handler or

66
00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:03.220
the success handler, so
when I clicked on yes on success,

67
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.020
I'd changed the color of
the widget to green and

68
00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.530
I called the callback to let it know
that it finished successfully and

69
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.515
on the failure side was similar except
I set the background color to pink and

70
00:05:18.515 --> 00:05:24.025
success is undefined now to indicate
that we have a failure result and

71
00:05:24.025 --> 00:05:29.171
in the case of cancellation,
I just set the background to gray.

72
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:36.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why'd you reverse your
success fillers conviction node?

73
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.588
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Because node got it wrong.

74
00:05:37.588 --> 00:05:38.123
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Because it got it wrong?

75
00:05:38.123 --> 00:05:39.027
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Yeah
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay,

76
00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:41.633
I agree that it seemed really weird but

77
00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:47.103
now you start to use to hire people who
do it the right way it seems weird.

78
00:05:47.103 --> 00:05:49.585
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Yeah, exactly and
I know I mentioned this in the hazard,

79
00:05:49.585 --> 00:05:51.979
doing things right in a system
that does things wrong.

80
00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.756
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Douglas: It's going to, yeah, and

81
00:05:53.756 --> 00:05:54.670
I understand that.

82
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.000
I apologize for it.

83
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Douglas: I just couldn't bring myself

84
00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.890
to do it the wrong way.
