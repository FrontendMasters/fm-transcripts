2
00:00:04.128 --> 00:00:07.482
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So those last
two exercises are the introduction to

3
00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:09.840
the subject of security.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.650
And security is a really,
really important topic, and

5
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.550
unfortunately it's not well understood
at any level in our industry.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.140
So, some people think of security as a war
between people in invisible colored hats.

7
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.200
They're the white hat guys and
the black hat guys, and

8
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.360
the white hat guys are probably good guys
and black hat guys are probably bad guys,

9
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.090
except there are famous white hats that
used to be black hats, and black hats

10
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.230
who used to be white hats and grey hats
who seem to be playing both sides.

11
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.630
And it turns out you cannot easily
identify somebody by their invisible hat.

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.940
That this is a model of security
that just doesn't work.

13
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.037
Security is not about hats.

14
00:00:57.037 --> 00:01:00.422
The thing that's even worse
about that model is that it

15
00:01:00.422 --> 00:01:06.040
says that security belongs to the
specialists, and that model doesn't work.

16
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.990
So in the specialist model it means you've
got security experts who are responsible

17
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.150
for all the security and
nobody else is responsible for security.

18
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.170
And in fact everybody else is working
against the guys who are helping to

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.900
deal with security and
that model is not effective at all.

20
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.420
One consequence of, or one source of
insecurity is that things change.

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.210
It might be that within a limited scope or
a limited context you could do things and

22
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.520
there's no security
vulnerability in doing that.

23
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.760
But then, things change,
the scope increases, or whatever.

24
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.380
And now suddenly that turns
into a big security problem.

25
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.740
It is not unusual for
the purpose or use or

26
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.120
scope of software to change over its life.

27
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.040
Rarely are the security properties of
software systems reexamined in the context

28
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.130
of new or evolving missions.

29
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.680
This leads to insecure systems.

30
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.640
You know who wrote this?

31
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.812
I did, I wrote that, that's me.

32
00:02:05.936 --> 00:02:11.280
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So I'm going to
be giving you a set of principles.

33
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.790
And most of them are pretty simple and
pretty obvious and once you've got it,

34
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.840
you're able to reason about
security on your own.

35
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.490
The world of security is
incredibly complicated, and

36
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.045
is always changing, and it's impossible
for any human to keep on top of it,

37
00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:34.980
particularly a human who has a day job,
there's just no way.

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.225
But the set of principles is actually
very small and if you can understand

39
00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:44.705
the principles, you can work out
most of the rest of it on your own.

40
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:47.915
Security is not obtained by tricks or
hacks,

41
00:02:47.915 --> 00:02:53.435
if you ever encounter someone who says, we
can secure our system by doing this trick,

42
00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:55.840
that person is either misinformed or
lying.

43
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.722
Because it turns out tricks don't work,

44
00:02:57.722 --> 00:02:59.934
it's only adherence to
principles that works.

45
00:03:03.384 --> 00:03:05.530
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So
one of the first principles for

46
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.357
online security of computer systems
is that deterrence is not effective,

47
00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:15.050
and that's because you can't
punish an invisible attacker.

48
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.680
Now in the real world,
deterrence is very effective.

49
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.510
That's why we have not
blown ourselves up yet.

50
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.150
But online an attacker doesn't need to
be awake while he's attacking you so

51
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.417
there's no threat you can make
to someone you can't see or

52
00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:30.768
touch to prevent them from doing things.

53
00:03:30.768 --> 00:03:33.127
So the only thing that
works is prevention,

54
00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:35.630
prevention is the only
effective mechanism.

55
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.130
So I'm gonna stop here and tell you
a story about Johann Martin Schleyer.

56
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.321
Schleyer was a priest
living in Bavaria and

57
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:50.026
one night God came to him in a dream and
told him to do something.

58
00:03:50.026 --> 00:03:53.190
Now in order to understand that story
I need to tell you an earlier story.

59
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.680
Long, long ago on the plain of Shinar,
the world's best architects,

60
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.080
builders, engineers,
material specialists, and

61
00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.310
workers got together to build
a tower that would reach to heaven.

62
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.950
It was the biggest construction project in
the history of the world at that point.

63
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.850
It was amazing project and
God was not happy about it.

64
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.528
We don't know what his complaint
about the project was but

65
00:04:20.528 --> 00:04:25.195
he did not want it succeeding, so
he decided to cause the project to fail.

66
00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:29.492
And he had a lot of options available as
to how he was going to fail the project.

67
00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:32.577
He could have caused earthquakes,
he could have flooded the plane,

68
00:04:32.577 --> 00:04:35.680
he could have thrown
thunderbolts down on them.

69
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.346
Instead he decided to go down and
confuse their speech.

70
00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:45.258
And after he did that they could no longer
understand each other when they spoke,

71
00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:48.945
and being unable to communicate
the project collapsed, and

72
00:04:48.945 --> 00:04:52.359
they all wandered off and
started their own countries.

73
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.266
Basically he created the i18n problem.

74
00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.782
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So thousands of
years later he comes to Schleyer while

75
00:05:02.782 --> 00:05:07.981
he's sleeping and says, I've changed
my mind about that, and what I want

76
00:05:07.981 --> 00:05:13.530
you to do now is to create a language that
everybody in the world can understand.

77
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.940
So Schleyer wakes up and he begins working
on his language, which he calls Volapuk.

78
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.250
Volapuk being the word in Volapuk,
meaning world speak.

79
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.790
He based his vocabulary on English, but

80
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.840
he transformed it so much that it is
no help to English speakers at all.

81
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.630
It's hard to see the words world and
speech in there,

82
00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.610
but that's where the roots came from.

83
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.708
And he was told that English speakers
did not have a problem with umlauts.

84
00:05:45.708 --> 00:05:50.951
But I can tell you this English speaker
has a lot of trouble with umlauts.

85
00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:52.943
But he published his language anyway.

86
00:05:52.943 --> 00:05:56.020
He worked for about a year and then and

87
00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.593
published a book in German
about Volapuk in 1880.

88
00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:05.934
Now people had been designing artificial
languages for many years before Schleyer.

89
00:06:05.934 --> 00:06:10.955
There was John Wilkins and
Paul Garneau in England were doing similar

90
00:06:10.955 --> 00:06:16.151
sorts of things, and there been lots
of artificial languages after but

91
00:06:16.151 --> 00:06:19.630
Schleyer was doing this
at just the right time.

92
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.306
Europe had been in a fairly constant
state of war for centuries and

93
00:06:24.306 --> 00:06:26.433
people were getting really tired of it.

94
00:06:26.433 --> 00:06:29.978
And they observed what had just happened
in the U.S with their civil war,

95
00:06:29.978 --> 00:06:33.752
where new technologies were coming onto
the battlefield for the first time and

96
00:06:33.752 --> 00:06:36.930
the terrible devastation
that happened there.

97
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.300
And they were very concerned that this
was going to get really, really bad and

98
00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.130
there was a lot of interest in trying
to solve the world peace problem.

99
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.910
And a lot of them saw Volapuk
as a method for doing that.

100
00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.880
That Volapuk would allow us to
experience de-babelization,

101
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.520
where we would break down the language
barriers between countries and maybe if

102
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.540
we can communicate more effectively,
maybe the coming war could be avoided.

103
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.070
And so the Volapuk movement took off
all over the world, not just Europe but

104
00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.650
everywhere.

105
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.850
In cities all over the world Volapuk
societies were being created.

106
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.600
Books were being published about and
in Volapuk.

107
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.266
New journals were being written in
Volapuk, coming online every month,

108
00:07:23.266 --> 00:07:27.630
and it was reaching all
classes of society.

109
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.130
It wasn't just the intellectual
elites learning this stuff.

110
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:35.390
Everybody was interested in Volapuk and
it was really taking off.

111
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.996
And a lot of the success of
the language was due to this guy.

112
00:07:37.996 --> 00:07:40.100
This is Auguste Kerckhoffs.

113
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.621
He was a Dutch linguist, and
he wrote extensively about Volapuk and

114
00:07:44.621 --> 00:07:47.680
traveled all over the world
teaching the language.

115
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:52.725
And he was so successful at doing that but
at the Second Volapuk Conference,

116
00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:57.775
he was elected to be director
of the Volapuk Institute, and

117
00:07:57.775 --> 00:08:01.385
given the job of popularizing
Volapuk throughout the world.

118
00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.485
The next year at the Third Congress,

119
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:10.828
at that Congress they did all of
the business in the Congress in Volapuk,

120
00:08:10.828 --> 00:08:15.207
even the waiters serving
the meals were speaking Volapuk,

121
00:08:15.207 --> 00:08:20.130
and Kerckhoffs at that meeting
proposed a change to the language.

122
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:24.757
There were some moods in the language
which were rarely used, that were very

123
00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:29.607
complicated and difficult to teach and
learn and Kerckhoffs was proposing that

124
00:08:29.607 --> 00:08:35.210
they be removed from the language in order
to make it more accessible to everybody.

125
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.700
Basically Volapuk, the good parts.

126
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.010
I love this guy.

127
00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:40.620
He was great.

128
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.770
Schleyer was extremely upset about this.

129
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.906
Schleyer insisted that
the language belonged to him and

130
00:08:48.906 --> 00:08:53.840
he demanded a veto over anything
that the Congress might propose.

131
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.374
At that point the movement forked.

132
00:08:56.374 --> 00:09:00.738
About half of the attendees were in
the German delegation and they went with

133
00:09:00.738 --> 00:09:05.250
Schleyer, everybody else went with
Kerckhoffs, and then suddenly chaos.

134
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:09.875
They're all these cunning linguists who
said well as long as we're proposing

135
00:09:09.875 --> 00:09:13.075
changes I got some ideas, and
they started throwing new features out for

136
00:09:13.075 --> 00:09:14.351
what could go into Volapuk.

137
00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:17.458
And other people saying well,
Esperanto's a better language,

138
00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:18.765
we should go with that one.

139
00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:20.783
And the thing collapsed.

140
00:09:20.783 --> 00:09:26.310
Almost overnight Volapuk was dead.

141
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:32.122
So we don't know what would have
happened had Volapuk succeeded,

142
00:09:32.122 --> 00:09:36.584
but we do know what happened
after Volapuk failed,

143
00:09:36.584 --> 00:09:41.270
that the world had its
bloodiest century in history.

144
00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.785
So they ended up with re-babelization.

145
00:09:43.785 --> 00:09:47.830
After it collapsed they had more
languages than when they started.

146
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:53.469
And people continue to design languages,
it's similar to the compulsion that causes

147
00:09:53.469 --> 00:09:55.820
some people to design
programming languages.

148
00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:01.850
The guy who designed the Saint,
you remember that TV show and the movie?

149
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.227
He designed a language called Paleo Neo.

150
00:10:05.227 --> 00:10:07.187
The guy who designed the board game,
Careers,

151
00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:08.960
designed a language called Interlingua.

152
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:14.558
Maybe the most famous of all
language designers was JRR Tolkien,

153
00:10:14.558 --> 00:10:19.880
who designed languages for
epic races like elves and

154
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.170
dwarves, and
wrote epic poetry in those languages and

155
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.460
then wrote histories to explain
the context of those epics.

156
00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.680
And then used all of that as the back
story to the Lord Of The Rings.

157
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.469
He once gave a talk about his compulsion.

158
00:10:34.469 --> 00:10:35.690
He called it a secret vice.

159
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.834
Anybody happen to know what the most
popular invented language in the world

160
00:10:41.834 --> 00:10:42.474
is today?

161
00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:43.758
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Klingon.
