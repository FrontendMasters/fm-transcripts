2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.770
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I told you
that story because I want to

3
00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.350
introduce you the Kerckhoffs.

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.670
Kerckhoffs was an amazing guy.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.060
After the bulletproof thing exploded,
things went really bad for him,

6
00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.020
his health suffered and
it just, it went bad.

7
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.070
But just before he got involved with them,

8
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.610
he wrote the first book
about modern cryptography.

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.470
Prior to Kerckhoffs, cryptography was
understood as the science of secret codes,

10
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.960
generally codes written
on pieces of paper.

11
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.390
Kerckhoffs reinvented cryptography
based on electronic communication

12
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.620
because they were now sending messages
through the telegraph and the properties

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.170
of the telegraph are radically
different from the properties of paper.

14
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.410
And he worked this stuff out and

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.730
came up with a set of principles which
are still understood to be true today.

16
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.710
He was one of these amazing
thinkers who's just so smart and so

17
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.630
far ahead of his time.

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.420
So one of the things he wrote is
called The Kerckhoffs Principle and

19
00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.450
he said the design of a system
should not require secrecy and

20
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.850
compromise of the system should not
inconvenience the correspondents.

21
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.100
So let me demonstrate what
he's talking about here.

22
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.000
So we have two correspondents Alice and
Bob and they need to communicate and

23
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.200
they don't want to be observed
while they're doing that.

24
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.430
So they have a cryptographic system.

25
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.900
In this cryptographic system, Alice
takes her message, her plain text and

26
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.420
puts it in an encryption machine.

27
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.430
She also puts a key into the encryption
machine and out comes a cipher-text.

28
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.690
She then transmits
the cipher-text to Bob and

29
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.200
it's entirely possible that that wire is
being observed and anybody can see it.

30
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.400
Bob receives the cipher-text, he puts it
in his decryption machine which may be

31
00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.080
identical to Alice's encryption
machine and also puts in the same key,

32
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.099
which they exchanged in a prior meeting,
and that allows him to obtain the plain

33
00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.720
text and this is basically how
all cryptographic systems work.

34
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.970
The thing that Kerckhoffs
said which was so

35
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.490
amazing was that there are no
secrets in the encryption machine.

36
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.210
The only secret in
the system is the key and

37
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:27.060
I still see people today, academics who
are saying, we should try to keep as

38
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.620
much of our system private as we can
in order to frustrate the attackers.

39
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.165
Kerckhoffs said no, just protect the keys,
that's all you have to do.

40
00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:43.340
And he was right and he was right because
there is no security in obscurity.

41
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.770
And it turns out the more secrets you
have, the harder they are to keep and

42
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.260
just keeping the keys safe is really hard.

43
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.330
So you should focus all of
your attention on that.

44
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.170
There are some people who take
The Kerckhoffs Principle so

45
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.700
far as to say we should publish everything
about our system except our keys,

46
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.860
the good thing about that attitude
is you're never confused about

47
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.620
what are the important
secrets in your system.

48
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.960
So cryptography is not security but

49
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.529
the way that cryptographers
think about problems

50
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.020
Is a really useful way of thinking and
we should think like that too.

51
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.360
So I'm gonna try to teach you
to think like a cryptographer.

52
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.570
I'm gonna do that by teaching
about a cryptographic system

53
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.780
called the One Time Pad.

54
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.490
This is the only cryptographic system
which is guaranteed to be truly

55
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.009
unbreakable.

56
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.270
In all other cryptographic systems,
if you have enough time and

57
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.400
enough computer power, eventually you
can brute force, try every key and

58
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.610
eventually you'll break the system.

59
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.586
Not possible with a system, guaranteed
unbreakable which is pretty nice.

60
00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:54.350
There are rumours that the hotline
between the White House and

61
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.950
the Kremlin is encrypted
with the One Time Pad.

62
00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.630
So this is how it works.

63
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.590
We have a number of rules
that we have to follow.

64
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.490
The first one is that the key
must always remain secret.

65
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.445
This is true of every
cryptographic system.

66
00:04:09.505 --> 00:04:13.755
Number two, the key must be at
least as long as the plain text.

67
00:04:13.755 --> 00:04:15.965
Now this is really unusual.

68
00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:19.835
In most cryptographic systems,
the key is some fixed size and

69
00:04:19.835 --> 00:04:23.035
the messages tend to be
much longer than the key.

70
00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:26.560
This one says the key has to be
at least as long as the message.

71
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.410
Then the cypher text is
obtained by Exclusive-ORing

72
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.606
the plain text and the key.

73
00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:32.210
That is the algorithm.

74
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.590
That is the implementation of the system,
so it's really, really simple.

75
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.750
So let me demonstrate it to you.

76
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.650
This my plain text.

77
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.890
This is the JSON logo.

78
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.984
I'm using it because I can.

79
00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:49.260
Usually you think of a plain text as being
a text, but this is an array of ones and

80
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.080
zeros, right?

81
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.320
So we can encrypt that.

82
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.000
This is my key.

83
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.530
The key is the same size as the message.

84
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.680
I'm going to Exclusive-OR them
together and if I do this correctly,

85
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.220
you should not see any sign, any ghost,
any whisper of the original message.

86
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.970
If a message is completely obscured,
hidden in the noise,

87
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.360
then I have encrypted it correctly.

88
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.620
The next rule says that the key
must be perfectly random or

89
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.980
cryptographically random.

90
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.460
Getting that kind of randomness is hard.

91
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.080
Now I went to a lot of trouble
to get that into my key.

92
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.750
So let me show you what
happens if you don't.

93
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.800
So this is a key, it looks just
like the key I showed you first,

94
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.500
except I made this one in Photoshop
with a noise filter, okay and

95
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.970
Photoshop's noise filters are not
guaranteed to be cryptographically random.

96
00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.740
So if I Exclusive-OR my plain text with
this weak key, you can see it, right?

97
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.740
It's leaking through.

98
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.140
This is what crypt analysts are looking
for when they're breaking codes.

99
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.980
They're looking for any kind of pattern,

100
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.170
any kind of signal that's
leaking through the noise.

101
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.220
You are breaking an unbreakable
code with your brain,

102
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.370
and you're not even working hard at it.

103
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.520
And the reason you're able to
do that is your visual system

104
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.210
is extremely effective at
separating signal from noise, and

105
00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.790
that's what crypt analysts do when
they're trying to break a code.

106
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.660
The next rule is so important,
it is the name of the system.

107
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.900
A key must never be used more than once.

108
00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.940
So the metaphor for
how the system is used is I will print

109
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.150
two identical books of random numbers.

110
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.549
I will keep one,
I will give you the other one.

111
00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:42.550
When I want to encrypt a message to you,
I will take the first sheet,

112
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:46.650
I will tear it out, I will encrypt
with it, I will then destroy it.

113
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.400
When you receive the message,
you will take the corresponding

114
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.700
sheet out of your book, you will decrypt
with it, and you will destroy it.

115
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.440
You will never use it again.

116
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.179
That's why it's called the One Time Pad.

117
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.830
So what happens if we violate that rule?

118
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.030
So this is a picture of me.

119
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.720
This was taken in Istanbul.

120
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.040
I'm using it because I can.

121
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.780
This, you'll recognise is
the first key that I showed you.

122
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.320
This is the first good key and

123
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:18.870
I'm going to encrypt my picture with
that and again, it's completely hidden.

124
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.450
I'm now going to
Exclusive-OR this one with

125
00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.370
the first cipher text that I obtained.

126
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.000
And what happens is because they
each are Exclusive-ORed with a key,

127
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.100
the key will cancel out and I'm left
with the two messages Exclusive-ORed

128
00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.430
with each other and
there is no security in that.

129
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.020
So cryptography is not security,

130
00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:43.810
but cryptography can teach
us stuff about security.

131
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.760
It's something I've found is that

132
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.200
often we think incorrectly
about how to use cryptography.

133
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.352
If I'm looking at someone's system and

134
00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:57.430
there are obvious security vulnerabilities
in them and I point them out to

135
00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:01.950
the architect, the architect's first
response is, we need to encrypt something.

136
00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:04.780
That turns out not to work.

137
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.040
But thinking like cryptographers,
that does work and

138
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.430
one of the tools that they use for
thinking

139
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:16.350
is they have a cast of characters who they
use for reasoning about their systems.

140
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:18.410
We've already met Alice and Bob.

141
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:21.640
They are standard characters
in the cryptographic show,

142
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.400
but there are lots of other characters.

143
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.500
For example, there is Eve.

144
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.990
Eve is an eavesdropper.

145
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:35.150
Eve might have a packet sniffer and
Eve might be NSA for example.

146
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.450
Eve is looking at everything
that's going between Alice and

147
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:42.440
Bob, and Eve is hoping to
accumulate enough stuff that

148
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.950
eventually she'll have enough information
to break their system or at least

149
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.309
be able to observe the pattern of their
communication and do a traffic analysis.

150
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.470
Then there is Mallory.

151
00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.630
Mallory can do man in the middle of it,
man in the middle attacks.

152
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:03.590
Mallory might be operating a public
hot spot, and so Bob connects

153
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.080
to Mallory's network thinking that
he's gonna connect to Alice, but

154
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.920
he's actually connected to Mallory.

155
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.920
Mallory connects to Alice and
Bob tries to log in.

156
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.740
Mallory asks Bob, what's your password,
Mallory connects to Alice.

157
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.620
Alice says what's your password,
Mallory gives Bob's password to Alice.

158
00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.660
Now he tells Alice,
please transfer my funds.

159
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.640
Mallory says to Alice,
please change my password.

160
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:32.630
Mallory says to Bob, I'm sorry we're
down right now, please come back later.

161
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.360
Is that something we
should be worried about?

162
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.380
Yeah, we should be worried about that,
yeah.

163
00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:42.056
And then finally in my own practice,
I have a character I call Satan.

164
00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:47.850
Satan is totally malicious.

165
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.954
He was very, very powerful, he is very,
very smart, he's very, very determined.

166
00:09:51.954 --> 00:09:57.080
And he's financed, he's got the tools and
he wants to hurt us and our customers.

167
00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.050
The approach that some people
take to him is to say well,

168
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.670
we won't let him connect to us.

169
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.400
You know if you're Satan,
you can't connect.

170
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.490
That's called a blacklist and
that doesn't work.

171
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.820
On the Internet, it is so
easy to create new identities that

172
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:19.830
you can't do that because
he'll just be somebody else.

173
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.480
So the other approach is we will
allow everybody to connect to us who

174
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.080
is not Satan.

175
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.820
That's a white list and
that doesn't work either in this case.

176
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:33.550
The only thing that works
is recognising that Satan

177
00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:37.520
is going to connect to us and
he is going to do to us and

178
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.700
our customers whatever we allow
him to do to us and our customers.

179
00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:48.250
And so we have a responsibility to do
everything right so that the capabilities

180
00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:54.170
that we give to Satan are so limited and
so weak that he cannot cause us harm.

181
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.870
That is the only thing that works.

182
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.290
Nothing else works.

183
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:06.280
So because of that, security must be
factored into every decision we make.

184
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.470
Everything we do has
security implications and

185
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.460
can either make things better or
worse for Satan.

186
00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:19.010
One big source of insecurity is
the idea that we'll go back and

187
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:20.450
make it secure later.

188
00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.300
It's very common that engineers who
are building something will think the hard

189
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.850
part is going to be to get the systems
to boot, or the boxes to talk, or

190
00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:28.950
the pixels on the screen.

191
00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.090
Once we've done that,
2,0 will go back and add security.

192
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:34.800
Turns out that doesn't work.

193
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.980
Security is a really
hard thing to retrofit.

194
00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:42.410
You need to get the stuff right at
the beginning and all along all the time.

195
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.310
You can't add security just
as you can't add reliability.

196
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.740
These are things that have to be removed.

197
00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.850
That you have to remove insecurity.

198
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.120
You have to remove unreliability.

199
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.910
You can't add them.

200
00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.310
Having survived to this point does
not guarantee future survival.

201
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:05.070
Everybody who does business on
the web has been under attacked

202
00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.730
since the beginning of the web and
they have not destroyed us yet, but

203
00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:13.680
that does not guarantee that they won't
and so you have to always remain vigilant.

204
00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:18.835
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: The impossible
is not possible, so

205
00:12:18.835 --> 00:12:23.220
don't expect impossible
means to protect you.

206
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.260
If a measure is not effective,
it is ineffective, and

207
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.659
we should not be wasting any time or
attention on it.

208
00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.960
Don't attempt to prohibit
what you can't prevent.

209
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.840
And what you don't prevent, you allow.

210
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.360
False security is worse than
no security because if you

211
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.870
know you're not secure, you'll be cautious
and if you think you're secure and

212
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.450
you're not, you will be reckless.
