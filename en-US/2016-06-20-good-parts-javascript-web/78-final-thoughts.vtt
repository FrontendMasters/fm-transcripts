2
00:00:03.665 --> 00:00:05.250
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Let's talk
about responsibility.

3
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.430
Who are you responsible to
when you're programming?

4
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.450
Well this is my answer,

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.630
this is who I think I am responsible
to when I'm writing code.

6
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.400
My number one responsibility
is to The People.

7
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.480
To the poor bastards who
have to use my software.

8
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.020
I want to work really well for them,
I don't want to frustrate them,

9
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.100
I don't want to confuse them,
I don't want to hurt them,

10
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.930
I don't want to lead them to ruin, I want
to give them the best experience possible,

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.820
I want to make their lives
better to the extent that I can.

12
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.420
We imagine in the software industry that
we're making the world a better place

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.840
despite all the obvious
evidence to the contrary,

14
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.410
we'd really want to believe that but
we should at least try to make it true for

15
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.110
the people who are using our
stuff as they're using it.

16
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.020
We should at least do that.

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.750
I've seen teams where they have contempt
for their users, they hate their users,

18
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.790
the user's always complaining, they
don't understand how to use their stuff,

19
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.970
they don't appreciate our genius,
they're stupid, they're awful people,

20
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.850
hate them, which I think is totally toxic,
that it's inexcusable.

21
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.990
We should never be thinking like that.

22
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.460
Everything that we do should
be in service to humanity.

23
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.100
Number two, The team.

24
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.440
I want to be writing the best code
that I can, the clearest, best,

25
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.480
well documented, easy to understand,
good code because

26
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.270
other people who I'm gonna be working
with are gonna have to take that code and

27
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.020
make it better and I don't want to
be setting them up for failure,

28
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.760
I don't want to be frustrating them, I
don't want to be making their lives worse,

29
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.870
I want to make their lives better,
I want good code for everybody and

30
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.470
I expect them to do the same so
programming can be

31
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.050
a solo activity but generally we're trying
to do stuff which is so complicated.

32
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.810
We're trying to do it so quickly.

33
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.780
We're working in teams almost all
the time and sometimes big teams.

34
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.350
And in large literary efforts, there's
this idea of writing with a single voice.

35
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.340
Like if you're writing an encyclopedia, or

36
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.700
if your a couple of authors writing a
book, or if you're writing a magazine, or

37
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.820
some other thing we've got lots of
writers working on the same project.

38
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.140
They're all trying to
write in the same voice.

39
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.740
And that doesn't interfere at

40
00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.170
all with being able to express good
ideas and presenting it clearly.

41
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.180
And I think we need to be doing
that in writing software too, so

42
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.190
I want us to be writing
all in the same voice and

43
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.040
that voice is the smartest most
professional programmer who's ever lived.

44
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.240
I want everybody on the team to
be writing up to that level.

45
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.220
I don't want anybody dumbing it down
because they think they need to

46
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.030
express themselves by
leaving out the semicolons.

47
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.770
I want everybody to be
writing really well.

48
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.300
Then number three, Management.

49
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.660
If they ask for it and it makes sense,
okay we'll do that too.

50
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.660
Now some managers might be saying, woh,
what a minute, we're supposed to be in

51
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.050
charge here, shouldn't we be
number one and I don't think so.

52
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.050
I think number three is
the right place for them.

53
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.990
If you look at what a CEO does one of
their most important responsibilities

54
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.680
is to help the company look out.

55
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.530
There's a tendency in the company
especially as they get bigger

56
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.330
that everything is focused inside.

57
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.940
There's competition for resources and
attention and promotion and

58
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.090
all of that stuff, and
you tend to forget about the customer and

59
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.220
you can forget the and you tend to forget
about the marketplace and all these really

60
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.190
things that are actually much more
important than what's going on inside and

61
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.230
part of the CEO's role is to
remind the company of that and

62
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.820
you see CEO's always saying things like be
the customer and be customer focused and

63
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.360
all that stuff that's
what that's all about.

64
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.440
And that's very compatible with
what I'm what I'm saying and

65
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.000
saying number one, The People.

66
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.930
Then one of the biggest problems
that companies have is that their

67
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.970
code bases are awful, that they're full
of croft there with the call legacy it's

68
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:17.240
just awful stuff and that seriously
impairs the company's ability to compete.

69
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:21.230
That you can't make changes,
you can't extend, you can't grow

70
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.390
because the software is holding you
back because of it's poor quality.

71
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.279
The software becomes a liability
rather than an asset.

72
00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.097
And I think we can change that if we're
writing high quality of software for

73
00:04:35.097 --> 00:04:38.710
the team, that we allow the company
then to be much more competitive,

74
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.620
much more responsive,
much better to serve the market.

75
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.575
Suppose you're writing your own software,

76
00:04:45.575 --> 00:04:50.190
your home and you're doing your own stuff,
what are your responsibilities then?

77
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.519
Number one still The People, assuming
that someone else is ever gonna have to

78
00:04:56.519 --> 00:05:00.650
write your stuff you really should write
it well for them whoever they might be,

79
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.968
even if you don't know who they're gonna
be should still have somebody in mind when

80
00:05:04.968 --> 00:05:06.533
you're writing this stuff.

81
00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:10.400
And then number two The Team,
if you have any ambition of

82
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.257
this stuff getting good enough that
you might wanna open source it that

83
00:05:15.257 --> 00:05:19.891
means your team is now potentially
every programmer in the world.

84
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:21.500
So make it good for them.

85
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.060
And then number three your management so
knock yourself out.

86
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.000
That brings us to the end.

87
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.250
I can't think of anything
else to tell you.

88
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.800
So, thank you all very much.

89
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.000
But before we go,
I've got one piece of advice.

90
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.830
This is really serious,
I hope you don't forget this.

91
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.330
This is, I'm really serious now.

92
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.629
Please, don't make bugs.

93
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.232
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Thank you.

94
00:05:47.232 --> 00:05:53.019
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We've

95
00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:57.069
got a couple random questions from Chad.

96
00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:59.928
I'm not sure if you want to
take any more questions but.

97
00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:01.630
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Are they good?

98
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well it's just kind
of opinions, opinions on Swift.

99
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.438
I don't have an opinion on Swift.

100
00:06:10.438 --> 00:06:15.397
[CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: How about your opinion

101
00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:16.079
on typescript?

102
00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:20.122
&gt;&gt; Douglas: On typescript, I see
typescript as a trap, it keeps you in

103
00:06:20.122 --> 00:06:26.410
a classical model, you'll never figure out
functions if yours locked into typescript.
