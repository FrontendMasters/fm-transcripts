2
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.992
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So
good morning, I'm Doug Crockford.

3
00:00:39.992 --> 00:00:43.420
This is three days of the good parts.

4
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.440
Unexpectedly, JavaScript has become,
perhaps the most important programming

5
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.020
language in the world,
which is surprising,

6
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.970
because it's also the world's most
misunderstood programming language,

7
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.080
which we'll try to fix
some of that this week.

8
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.010
So, this is the outline for the course.

9
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.670
Today is going to be a series of five
lectures and I apologize for that.

10
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.695
There's a lot of information
I need to give you and

11
00:01:05.695 --> 00:01:08.150
the only way I know to
do that is to say it.

12
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.079
So you're gonna have to listen
to me whining on all day, but

13
00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.130
tomorrow will be much better.

14
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.897
Tomorrow, we're gonna workshop.

15
00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:17.520
We're gonna have fun with functions.

16
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.595
You could be writing programs and
it's gonna be great.

17
00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:22.190
We're gonna have a much
better time tomorrow.

18
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.542
Then on the third day,
we'll do some more fun with functions,

19
00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:28.460
then we'll also look at
some very important topics.

20
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.583
Security, asynchronicity, which is
something you have to deal on a lot with,

21
00:01:33.583 --> 00:01:39.011
especially in servers and the better parts
looking at the future of this language and

22
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:41.771
other languages So that sound agreeable.

23
00:01:41.771 --> 00:01:46.940
So, let's begin with part one
programming style and your brain.

24
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.420
These are two topics which appear to
have nothing to do with each other.

25
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.512
Programming Style is the part of your
program that the compiler notice and

26
00:01:54.512 --> 00:01:57.878
some people think that because
the compiler doesn't care,

27
00:01:57.878 --> 00:02:02.250
you shouldn't care any styles as good
as another it's just a matter of taste.

28
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.426
I'm gonna try to persuade you
that that is not the case,

29
00:02:05.426 --> 00:02:09.770
that some styles are significantly
better than others and then your brain.

30
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.314
Your brain is that big wad of meat in
your skull that you think with and

31
00:02:14.314 --> 00:02:18.870
what possible connection could
there be between these two things?

32
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.400
Well, turns out there is a connection,
a surprising and important one.

33
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.597
I'm gonna be misrepresenting
the work of Daniel Kahneman,

34
00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:27.420
the Nobel Winning Psychologist.

35
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.520
Now, Nobel does not give a prize for
psychology.

36
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.178
So they gave him the award for economics,
but he's not an economist, but

37
00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:38.080
he found that one of the fundamental
assumptions of economics doesn't hold.

38
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.353
That is that in any transaction,

39
00:02:40.353 --> 00:02:44.830
a party can be expected to
pursue their own best interests.

40
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.376
Kahneman shows this is not the case
if a party is a human being,

41
00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:52.347
because human beings do not think
the way economists think we think.

42
00:02:52.347 --> 00:02:56.270
In fact, none of us think
the way we think we think.

43
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.914
And the more you study Kahneman,

44
00:02:57.914 --> 00:03:00.860
the more amazing it is that we
ever get anything done at all.

45
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.862
So Kahneman has a metaphor for

46
00:03:02.862 --> 00:03:06.634
human thought based on
the interaction of two systems.

47
00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:08.290
System two and system one.

48
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.310
System two, which we can think of as
the head is the higher level one.

49
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.120
It's analytic.

50
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.111
It's algorithmic.

51
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:20.420
It's where we do mathematics and
reasoning, and logic.

52
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.390
It's a really sophisticated machine.

53
00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.031
It requires a tremendous amount of
effort to use and it is very slow.

54
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.260
So, we leave it turned
off as much as possible.

55
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.524
It's because that system is so
slow that we had to invent computers,

56
00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:40.376
because system two is not capable of
generating all of the numbers that society

57
00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:43.640
needed in order to do it social evolution.

58
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.146
So we needed to come up with
machines to do that processing for

59
00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:49.015
us, then there's system one.

60
00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:51.700
System one, you can think of as your gut.

61
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.900
It is intuitive.

62
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.100
It's heuristic.

63
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.820
It's associative.

64
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.830
It is very, very fast.

65
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.500
It requires no effort.

66
00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.110
And in fact, you cannot turn it off.

67
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.590
It's on all the time and the idea that
we have these two systems is not new.

68
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.585
I mean, we all have this intuitive sense
that we've got these two systems and

69
00:04:08.585 --> 00:04:10.380
sometimes you can even hear them.

70
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.854
Sometimes if you're confused about
something important, you can hear your

71
00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:16.910
head telling you one thing and
your gut telling you something else.

72
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.134
We've all experienced that.

73
00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:22.628
What Kahneman found was how
the two systems are connected.

74
00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:27.019
It turns up system two gets
its assumptions, its givens,

75
00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:32.138
its working set from system one and
is not aware of that connection.

76
00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:36.470
System two thinks it's getting the stuff
from the vault of deep truth, but

77
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.170
it's not.

78
00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.263
It's getting it from system one and
system one,

79
00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:44.573
because it's an approximate system
sometimes gets things wrong.

80
00:04:44.573 --> 00:04:47.866
And if you have a logical
system with false inputs,

81
00:04:47.866 --> 00:04:52.010
you can get false outputs and
it turns out we do this all the time.
