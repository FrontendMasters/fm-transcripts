[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.146 --> 00:00:07.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: There's a question about
being able to freeze data objects.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.230
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: You can, I don't
recommend it unless you have something

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.460
that really wants to be immutable.

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.470
Remember that once you freeze
something you can't unfreeze it.

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.750
So you're only going one way.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: And
then let's see, Dates and JSON.

8
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.940
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Nope, JSON's done.

9
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah.

10
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.100
Well, no okay.

11
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.900
So you just don't have
a recommended format?

12
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.840
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: JavaScript didn't
have one so JSON didn't get one.

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:39.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Use timestamp?

14
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.710
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Yep,
I'd recommend using ISO Strings.

15
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.370
That seems to be the smartest thing.

16
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.660
I know there are lot of people who
don't like doing smartest things, so

17
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.860
they're free to do whatever they want.

18
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What's your take on
the JSON [INAUDIBLE] spec that's been

19
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.250
going around recently?

20
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.500
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: For Java?

21
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.791
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: No, it's a [INAUDIBLE] and

22
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:05.630
it's being kinda way to format JSON
admins for [INAUDIBLE] server.

23
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.603
Basic collection of how you
organize data inside the algorithm.

24
00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:11.780
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I'm not aware of it.

25
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.110
Anybody is free to do anything they want.

26
00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.105
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thread and bugs.

27
00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:20.186
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: No,
unfortunately they're free to do that too.

28
00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:24.815
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Why don't you have

29
00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:25.590
an opinion on Swift?

30
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.190
Have you just not looked at it enough, or-
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I've

31
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.450
not looked at enough.

32
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.480
I went to get the Swift report and

33
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.690
it was hidden behind some Apple
login thing and said hell with that.

34
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.880
So I didn't get it.

35
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.620
So I'm not up to date on it.

36
00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.067
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's the reason
you don't use camel case.

37
00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.866
[INAUDIBLE].

38
00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:46.329
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So
there's this big debate,

39
00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:52.251
what is the correct way to do
multi-word identifiers in any language?

40
00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.695
Should you use camel case or
should you use under bars and

41
00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:57.763
this is another one of those things
that programmers can't agree on,

42
00:01:57.763 --> 00:02:00.220
that you know there's an endless argument.

43
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.560
And the reason there is an endless
argument why it will never end,

44
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.110
is because they are both wrong.

45
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.820
That the correct thing should
have been to use space,

46
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.550
that our languages only have to get a tiny
bit smarter and we could have spaces as

47
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.960
valid characters inside of names and
then they would read better and

48
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.890
they'd be easier to, to,
process and all of that stuff.

49
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.650
So one of the aspects I'm looking for in
the next language besides getting numbers

50
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.140
right, is that it'll also allow
space as a component of names.

51
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: That's in Angular or
Angular 2?

52
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.190
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Lots of angular or
angular two.

53
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.060
That's two completely different question.

54
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Either or?

55
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.560
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I've
looked at angular and

56
00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.820
I was kind of surprised at how hard
it is to get to make something easy.

57
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.390
I don't get it.

58
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.480
I hear from people who swear by it and

59
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.140
I think that's great and
maybe it solves the problem they have.

60
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.120
I've not observed that solves
a problem that I have.

61
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.330
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: It's the Stockholm thing,
I think with angular, once you get there.

62
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah.
This is great.

63
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.430
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Well the problem
with all these frameworks is that

64
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.540
once you get committed you are stuck.

65
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.940
You can't go,
that was mistake and back off.

66
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.570
You're fully committed and

67
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.790
so, you can't find out if any of these
things are good or not until you commit.

68
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.700
And so you have to be careful.

69
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.632
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So I went from Github
to Douglas Crawford dot com and

70
00:03:32.632 --> 00:03:34.832
you clearly have no low CSS.

71
00:03:34.832 --> 00:03:39.420
[LAUGH] There's no CSS on there.

72
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.160
[INAUDIBLE] What?

73
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.650
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: What?

74
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.140
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What's
your issue with C.S.S.?

75
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.000
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Are you going
to bring up that old wound again?

76
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.453
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Sir I, Yeah
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So C.S.S.

77
00:03:52.453 --> 00:04:00.160
was designed for formatting technical
documents that was its purpose in life.

78
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.700
And that is not what we use it form, we
use it for all kinds of stuff that is very

79
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.130
badly suited for and
we use it because it's the only option.

80
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.840
And it's better than it was before it came
along because in the past there were no

81
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.161
options used to see people doing
typographic spacing by having tiny little

82
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:23.520
that with a little bit of
white space in them which

83
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.070
was considered a best practice on the day
but was always a terrible thing to do.

84
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.570
So, compared to that CSS is great but
compared to what we deserve it's awful.

85
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.009
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You can still use some HTML,
right, I mean-

86
00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.948
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Yeah That too.

87
00:04:38.948 --> 00:04:43.907
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Any opinions

88
00:04:43.907 --> 00:04:45.240
on the rust language?

89
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.510
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: No, I don't,
I have read some of their material.

90
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.680
It wasn't locked behind an Apple
password so I have read some of that and

91
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.820
some of it looks promising but
I don't have any conclusions yet.

92
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.596
I've not worked with it.

93
00:05:00.596 --> 00:05:03.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: What about trends,
pilers and, I mean,

94
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:06.237
do you have any recommendations or-
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: So

95
00:05:06.237 --> 00:05:11.390
let me say this about CoffeeScript,
which started this craze.

96
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.630
I like CoffeeScript a lot.

97
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.059
CoffeeScript makes some of the good
parts of JavaScript more visible.

98
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.520
For some people it's easier to learn how
to use JavaScript well if they learn

99
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.430
CoffeeScript also.

100
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.820
I think the thing I like
best about CoffeeScript

101
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.070
is that it doesn't look like C, or
Java, or any of those other languages.

102
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.810
It's got its own look.

103
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.350
It used to be said that no new programming
language could succeed unless it

104
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.920
looked like C.

105
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.580
In CoffeeScript is showing
that that's no longer true

106
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.510
CoffeeScript succeeds because
it doesn't look like C.

107
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.590
So, I like that a lot.

108
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.450
Then the question is,
should you use CoffeeScript in production?

109
00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.320
Absolutely not.

110
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.060
No, you should not use
CoffeeScript in production.

111
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.130
It's still an experimental language
it adds a lot of weirdness.

112
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.060
It makes it harder to
recruit people because

113
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.150
who's gonna write the CoffeeScript
stuff that some hipster left.

114
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.540
It's just not worth it.

115
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.870
So, I always recommend learn the language.

116
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.850
Pick up a new language and

117
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.310
some of the transpiled languages
are interesting, and are worth to study.

118
00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.110
But I don't recommend using
any of them in production.

119
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.350
I think, they don't add enough
value to justify the weirdness.

120
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Lots of thank yous, and

121
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.086
please extend their gratitude for
the training.

122
00:06:40.086 --> 00:06:44.100
Do you find anymore-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yes, somebody asking

123
00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.856
is there a reason that you disabled
bug reports on your get up projects.

124
00:06:47.856 --> 00:06:53.720
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I didn't do that.

125
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.600
What, I have complained to
get up that there is no

126
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:07.900
I'm trying to think of it the right way
to say this, I tend to attract trolls.

127
00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.690
I don't know why this is, but

128
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.490
there are a lot of people who really
want to come on to where I am and

129
00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:19.460
do trollish behavior, which is more
than annoying, it's a waste of time.

130
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:24.660
I have to deal with the patrols and
I don't like having to do that.

131
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.810
So I've asked Git Hub for
a no troll option.

132
00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.170
And so far they have not figured
out how to implement that.

133
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.615
So there are some things that I've turned
things off but it's not completely off,

134
00:07:35.615 --> 00:07:38.655
you can still get messages to me.

135
00:07:38.655 --> 00:07:43.255
But if you have trolled me, I put you on
the block list so that may be his concern.

136
00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:45.980
He may have trolled me in the past but
he can't troll me now.

137
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:54.903
[LAUGH]
So I'm not gonna apologize for that.

138
00:07:54.903 --> 00:07:58.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Did you have any
opinions on build systems?

139
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:05.210
You mentioned practices of concatenating,
and all that stuff.

140
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:09.780
They're saying things like web pack or
whatever.

141
00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.220
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: No,
I don't care, whatever works.

142
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:14.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I figured.

143
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.866
Not seeing any other questions.

144
00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:24.930
Anybody in the room?

145
00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:31.660
Your last chance to get
an opinion [LAUGH] all right.

146
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:32.647
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I
think we're adjurned.

147
00:08:32.647 --> 00:08:33.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Concluded, right.

148
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.220
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Thank you.
