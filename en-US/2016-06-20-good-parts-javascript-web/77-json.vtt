2
00:00:03.943 --> 00:00:06.534
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Now it turns out
I have a little bit of experience at

3
00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:09.508
convincing everybody in
the world to do the right thing.

4
00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:12.266
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: For example,

5
00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.611
there's the JSON data interchange format,

6
00:00:14.611 --> 00:00:17.270
the world's best loved
data interchange format.

7
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.988
It took a while to convince everybody but
eventually everybody got on board, and

8
00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:26.540
the death threat stopped and
we're all happy about it now.

9
00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:30.010
I'm very happy to report that this
took much less than a generation.

10
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.650
This is one of those very rare things
where we're able to move it in just a few

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:35.173
years.

12
00:00:35.173 --> 00:00:41.266
So, if you look at Google Trends and
compare the trends of JSON versus XML,

13
00:00:41.266 --> 00:00:46.890
you'll see that the world has
steadily been losing interest in XML.

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.060
Looks like that the years are chopped
off here but it's on the other screen.

15
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.170
Since 2005 the world has steadily
been losing interest in XML.

16
00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.850
And we've slowly, quietly been
seeing interest in JSON creeping up.

17
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.290
And this increase was not
motivated by any industry.

18
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.363
There is no JSON industry
which drives this there,

19
00:01:11.363 --> 00:01:15.935
because all the tools are free and
simple and so it's just happening because

20
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:20.457
you decided this is a better way of
doing things and so it's just taking up.

21
00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:25.796
So I can't predict when these lines cross
over but Google can, so looks like next

22
00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:31.541
year for sure JSON becomes officially more
interesting according to Google than XML.

23
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:35.625
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But in terms of
use people who were using JSON,

24
00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:41.810
as a data interchange there's
more people using JSON, right?

25
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.120
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I
have no way of knowing.

26
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.334
It seems like that to me too but-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think they're just

27
00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:48.625
Googling XML because it's still difficult
and we don't have to Google a JSON so

28
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:49.690
often cuz it's easy.

29
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.880
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I think there's
a lot to it there, yeah, so a lot of.

30
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.240
If the search suggestions, XML sucks,

31
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.970
that's a popular thing,
you don't see that on JSON searches.

32
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.309
So there may very well
be something to that.

33
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.428
So I did not intend for JSON to be
the last data interchange format.

34
00:02:15.428 --> 00:02:19.663
JSON was intended to do a very specific
thing of allowing applications written in

35
00:02:19.663 --> 00:02:23.150
different languages to be able to
communicate with each other over

36
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.975
the Internet.

37
00:02:23.975 --> 00:02:26.733
But JSON is now being used for
lots of other things,

38
00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.684
things that it wasn't
necessarily designed for and so

39
00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:32.940
I expect they're going to be
other data formats as well.

40
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.020
So, I have some advice to anybody else who
might be designing another data format.

41
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.980
Number one, please don't break JSON.

42
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.254
JSON is working really well for the thing
that it was originally designed for.

43
00:02:46.254 --> 00:02:51.800
One of the best things that I did in JSON
was, I did not put a version number on it.

44
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.770
So there is no way to revise it.

45
00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.600
We can't say JSON 1.1 because there
was no JSON 1, it's just JSON.

46
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.740
So the way it is,
is the way it will always be,

47
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.270
which is great because if
you look at the stack.

48
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.059
I expect over the years the stack is gonna
be changing all the time at every level,

49
00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.615
except in the JSON layer.

50
00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:19.157
The JSON layer will always work
the way it does right now.

51
00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:23.857
And that's a pretty nice thing,
having that level of reliability,

52
00:03:23.857 --> 00:03:27.500
the integrity and
anything in the net is huge.

53
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.290
I can't think of any feature we could add
to JSON which is more valuable than that.

54
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.250
So, if you want to make something else,
please make something else and

55
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.177
make it better.

56
00:03:37.177 --> 00:03:40.220
But don't try to break JSON,
leave JSON alone.

57
00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:43.814
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Whatever
you're gonna do,

58
00:03:43.814 --> 00:03:46.666
if you're gonna do something that's
kind of like JSON but different,

59
00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:48.580
make it significantly better.

60
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.130
If it's just JSON with one or two little
things, then what you're doing is you're

61
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.740
adding a compatibility hazard to
the world, that people are gonna

62
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.800
have to deal with this thing which
is kind of like JSON but isn't.

63
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.370
And so there's a cost to that.

64
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:10.682
So make sure the cost is worth it, add
enough value to it to justify that cost.

65
00:04:10.682 --> 00:04:16.458
And get a better name because no question,
the worst thing about JSON is the name.

66
00:04:16.458 --> 00:04:20.095
For one thing people are confused
about how to pronounce it.

67
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:23.029
I say JSON, a lot of people say JSON,

68
00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:26.926
it turns out the correct
pronunciation is JSON.

69
00:04:26.926 --> 00:04:29.541
&gt;&gt; Audience: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: Everybody?

70
00:04:29.541 --> 00:04:30.597
&gt;&gt; Audience: JSON.

71
00:04:30.597 --> 00:04:36.036
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: [LAUGH] Yeah, so and
I hear from guys all the time named Jason

72
00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:41.834
saying, I'm in the office and
I hear someone saying, what.

73
00:04:41.834 --> 00:04:44.342
So, I'm sorry Jason if you're here.

74
00:04:44.342 --> 00:04:47.174
I don't know what I was thinking, sorry.

75
00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:52.188
So I've heard from guys named
Jason that threaten to make

76
00:04:52.188 --> 00:04:58.300
new standards called Douglas, so
just to show me what it's like.

77
00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.770
But again,
the worst thing about JSON is the name.

78
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.200
It stood for JavaScript Object Notation
and almost everything about that is wrong.

79
00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.120
So I called it JavaScript
because I wanted to give credit

80
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.980
to JavaScript because that
is where the idea came from.

81
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.554
I didn't invent JSON, I discovered
it already in this language and

82
00:05:18.554 --> 00:05:20.889
I was trying to give respect to it.

83
00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:26.014
I was not trying to jump on JavaScript's
coat-tail because I'll tell you in 2001,

84
00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:28.970
JavaScript was not a much loved language,
right?

85
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.100
In saying, I'm JavaScript, that's not
a way to get credibility from anybody.

86
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.100
I was just trying to be honest, I was just
trying to recognize where it came from.

87
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.940
But the name is problematic, for one thing
people still don't know what Java is

88
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.910
versus JavaScript, and
that stuff is still going on.

89
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.668
And also there is a confusion that,
so JSON only works with JavaScript,

90
00:05:54.668 --> 00:05:57.638
no, that's not true, that was never true.

91
00:05:57.638 --> 00:06:02.523
There is also a confusion that I guess
the JavaScript language standard is

92
00:06:02.523 --> 00:06:05.375
what defines JSON and that was never true.

93
00:06:05.375 --> 00:06:09.083
But there are all these confusions that
happened because I chose the wrong name.

94
00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:10.416
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What should
you have called It?

95
00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:12.755
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: I don't know.

96
00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:14.560
&gt;&gt; Audience: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Douglas Crockford: That boat has

97
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.390
sailed, we're done.

98
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.760
Then there is object,

99
00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.350
object here represents the way that
JavaScript thinks about objects right,

100
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.390
just a loose collection of key
value pairs, that's an object.

101
00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.220
Which is not the way most languages
think about objects, right?

102
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.910
They have this more brittle thing, we've
got classes and instances, and so on.

103
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.230
So they get confused that we
can send them a JSON object and

104
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:38.564
they go that's not an object, yeah.

105
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.766
Notation, maybe that's okay.

106
00:06:41.766 --> 00:06:43.560
So notation is bad.

107
00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.920
So if you're going to make
up a new data standard and

108
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.030
I think you should, don't call it JSON.

109
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.390
Don't stick a letter in front of it or

110
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.190
a letter on the end of it or
anything like that.

111
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:58.910
Come up with some creativity,
do something good there.
