2
00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:07.089
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Both of these systems RQ and
JSCheck,

3
00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.260
make tremendous use of closure and
continuation.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.840
And the really great thing about
working with closure and continuation

5
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.630
is that they make you feel really
smart when you notice this right.

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.736
Yesterday, that you've been doing
a lot of work with closure,

7
00:00:24.736 --> 00:00:28.030
it makes you feel smart when you
get these things, it's like, mm.

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.207
So and everybody deserves to feel that way
yet you know how people who do a lot of

9
00:00:32.207 --> 00:00:37.770
functional programming are always acting
like they're so much smarter than you are?

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.462
They're not, but they're working
with this stuff all the time and

11
00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.482
it makes them feel good all the time.

12
00:00:43.482 --> 00:00:45.720
It makes them feel smart and
that's a really good way to feel,

13
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.300
everybody should feel like that.

14
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.360
Whereas the stuff you're working with
every day, does it make you feel smart?

15
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.680
No it does not.

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.230
So you want to get a hold of this stuff,
and it's great.

17
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.760
So both of these projects are public
domain, they're both on GitHub.

18
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.710
They're both totally free, if they can
help you go ahead and take it there's lots

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.240
of other good stuff in the world too if
that is better suited to you use that.

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.240
So any last questions about RQ or
JSCheck or synchronicity?

21
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.209
Yes?

22
00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
a couple that queued up here.

23
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.608
One, he was wondering if you,

24
00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:26.657
have you checked out Elm since the type
inference is the same as Hasko?

25
00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:29.720
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Yeah, I mentioned Elm earlier,
there's good stuff.

26
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.330
Everything in that list is good, but
I think our queue is of interest to you,

27
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.529
because it is the best suited, I think, to
the workflows that you have to implement.

28
00:01:47.448 --> 00:01:51.440
&gt;&gt; Douglas: Anything else?

29
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.750
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's one from
earlier from the security section.

30
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.360
He just wanted you to clarify,
or he's asking,

31
00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.390
we're learning about objects in
security and how to prevent attacks but

32
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.680
isn't this something that servers
are supposed to deal with?

33
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.300
&gt;&gt; Douglas: It's something everything
has to deal with, it's not so

34
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300
much the servers, it's us.

35
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.810
It's the people running the programs
we have to deal with the stuff.

36
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.986
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,
a little bit more specifically, though.

37
00:02:22.986 --> 00:02:26.224
It sounds like we're talking about,
you have an object and

38
00:02:26.224 --> 00:02:30.970
you don't want some other object to attack
it, this has to do with mash-ups, right?

39
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.160
Because you want to lend out
your code to somebody else and

40
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.800
you want to make sure that
they don't infect your code.

41
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.810
&gt;&gt; Douglas: I want to
strengthen everything, so

42
00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.730
if I can make my code strong enough
that I can run it with third parties,

43
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.600
which is the thing that we want
mash-ups to be able to do,

44
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.750
I can be confident that it's going to work
with my coworkers stuff as well that That

45
00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.300
most of the attacks that are bringing our
systems down are self-inflicted right.

46
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.050
The stuff that we do to ourselves because
we just didn't get it working well.

47
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Because you're not
saying if you're not doing mash-ups,

48
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.590
don't worry about this?

49
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.100
&gt;&gt; Douglas: No, no we need to
worry about this all the time.

50
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:16.060
Everything we write should be to that
level of quality, everything, everything.
