1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.872
So there's a little bit more game UI that
we need to add before we start making it

2
00:00:04.872 --> 00:00:07.611
look nice, and
that is the countdown timer.

3
00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:12.225
You'll recall from when we were
looking at this before we have

4
00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:15.252
a countdown timer at the top of the page.

5
00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:20.162
And you can see that the bar is gradually
dwindling, just makes the game a little

6
00:00:20.162 --> 00:00:24.430
bit more fun and challenging if
you're up against the clock.

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:32.046
So we're gonna create one more component,
that's a countdown.svelte component.

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.840
And inside there we're gonna

9
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.462
take a remaining prop.

10
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.215
And a duration prop.

11
00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:56.740
That should be a lowercase number.

12
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.070
We need to add lang=ts, so that we
know that we did them in Typescript.

13
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.539
Div class ="countdown", and then inside
that we're gonna have the pause button.

14
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.331
And the bar representing the duration, and

15
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:24.969
inside that bar,
the bar representing the remaining time.

16
00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:32.070
So the container element is
gonna be another flex element.

17
00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:45.668
The duration bar is
gonna fill the remainder

18
00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:50.849
of the space after
the button has been added.

19
00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:59.173
And then the remaining bar is just going
to be a position absolute bar inside that.

20
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:06.232
All right, let's add this component to the
page so that we can start seeing it, and

21
00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:09.417
that way, we'll get immediate
feedback as we're writing the styles.

22
00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:13.710
This will help us figure
out what needs to go where.

23
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.868
So go back to our page, and
then inside game.spelt in that

24
00:02:18.868 --> 00:02:24.282
top info container,
I'll add the countdown.

25
00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:34.470
Remaining let's just do LevelDuration for

26
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.884
now, and
then duration is also levelDuration.

27
00:02:46.524 --> 00:02:48.954
And you can see that it's
imported that component and

28
00:02:48.954 --> 00:02:50.628
put it at the top of our script block.

29
00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:03.244
So the first thing we wanna
do is get a pause icon

30
00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:06.761
that we can put inside our button.

31
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:12.836
What I usually do is I just
Google material design icons.

32
00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:15.754
There's a site called Pictogrammers,

33
00:03:15.754 --> 00:03:19.886
which I find pretty reliable
if I'm looking for an icon.

34
00:03:19.886 --> 00:03:26.320
If I go in here and I search for pause,
then I'll see this pause icon here.

35
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.050
That looks like basically what we want.

36
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.630
So I'm gonna open that,
click on the code symbol here.

37
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.923
It's gonna copy a bunch of SVG for me, and

38
00:03:35.923 --> 00:03:40.169
I'm just gonna put that
inside the button like that.

39
00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:48.560
We can't see it yet because we need
to make the button big enough.

40
00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.441
Okay, now we can see
the SVG inside the button.

41
00:04:04.441 --> 00:04:08.280
This duration div needs to have a width
and height so that we can see it.

42
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.115
We'll give that a height of 1em and
a background color of yellow so

43
00:04:14.115 --> 00:04:15.340
that we can see it.

44
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.500
And you can see that it is now
appearing at the top of the info block.

45
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.302
But we wanna make everything
inside here central aligned.

46
00:04:27.293 --> 00:04:34.513
Like that, and as is our custom,
we'll give it a gap of, let's say, 1.

47
00:04:34.513 --> 00:04:39.479
We're gonna make the button
have a square aspect

48
00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.443
ratio as well, like that,
and we're gonna make

49
00:04:44.443 --> 00:04:49.425
the contents of the button
fill this container.

50
00:04:59.155 --> 00:05:02.600
Okay, that's starting to
look how we want it to look.

51
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.423
Except that I think we're gonna want
to give the SVG a different fill color.

52
00:05:08.423 --> 00:05:15.290
I'm gonna make this slightly tidier so
that I can see what's going on.

53
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.340
At the end of the path, we don't have a
fill attribute, so we're gonna create one.

54
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.530
And for now we'll just put in 999 or
something like that.

55
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.995
At this point I think we can get rid of
the purple background on the info boxes

56
00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.790
because we don't need that anymore,
we can see what's happening.

57
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.499
Just gonna get rid of that, and I'm gonna
do the same for the grid container,

58
00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:42.550
we don't need that anymore.

59
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.780
I think it's starting to
look a little bit nicer.

60
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.694
Back over in countdow.svelte,

61
00:05:52.694 --> 00:05:57.597
we'll give the duration a background of,

62
00:05:57.597 --> 00:06:03.192
let's say, 999 again, a little later CCC.

63
00:06:03.192 --> 00:06:08.727
And then the remaining can
have a height of 100%,

64
00:06:08.727 --> 00:06:14.385
and a background that's gonna
be a little bit darker so

65
00:06:14.385 --> 00:06:18.329
that we can see it, let's do 999.

66
00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:22.514
Right now it's not visible because
we haven't given it a width.

67
00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:26.694
We're gonna need to control
the width based on how much time

68
00:06:26.694 --> 00:06:29.510
is remaining in our countdown.

69
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.550
One easy way to do this is to
use a CSS custom property.

70
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.567
So that's style=, and then do say, --p,

71
00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:41.621
it's gonna be remaining as
a proportion of the duration.

72
00:06:41.621 --> 00:06:45.986
And then we can base
the width on that value,

73
00:06:48.426 --> 00:06:55.385
To a count of 100% times
the p that we just parsed in.

74
00:06:55.385 --> 00:07:00.692
Right and now because the remaining
is default to the to the duration

75
00:07:00.692 --> 00:07:05.640
of the level, it's filling
the entire range that we've got.

76
00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.280
So let's actually make the countdown work.

77
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.158
Inside game.svelte,
we're gonna use request animation frame,

78
00:07:14.158 --> 00:07:16.342
we'll create a countdown function.

79
00:07:20.503 --> 00:07:25.239
And inside here, we'll have some
request animation frame logic that

80
00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:29.345
is gonna assign to some new
values that we're gonna create.

81
00:07:29.345 --> 00:07:34.206
So let remaining number is gonna

82
00:07:34.206 --> 00:07:38.528
begin as level.duration,

83
00:07:38.528 --> 00:07:44.837
that duration is also level.duration.

84
00:07:44.837 --> 00:07:47.590
But when we start the countdown,

85
00:07:50.552 --> 00:07:55.041
We're gonna decrement
remaining until it hits zero.

86
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:59.057
First thing we need to do is find
out what the current time is.

87
00:07:59.057 --> 00:08:06.270
Start = Date.now And

88
00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:10.962
then we can store how much time
is remaining at each point once

89
00:08:10.962 --> 00:08:16.121
the countdown activates,
remaining_at_start= remaining.

90
00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:20.502
Then we'll create our request animation
frame loop, just call it loop like that.

91
00:08:20.502 --> 00:08:24.843
And the first thing we're
gonna do is call itself,

92
00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:31.543
Inside request animation frame.

93
00:08:33.934 --> 00:08:40.074
And we're gonna assign to remaining
in the remaining_at_start

94
00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:44.682
minus whatever time has
elapsed since the start.

95
00:08:47.764 --> 00:08:50.617
Now, you might look at that code
that I just wrote and think, well,

96
00:08:50.617 --> 00:08:52.838
why not just subtract a 60th
of a second each time?

97
00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:54.115
It's a valid question.

98
00:08:54.115 --> 00:08:58.141
The reality is that you can't guarantee
that requestAnimationFrame is gonna be

99
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.375
called exactly 60 times a second.

100
00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:04.155
So you can get a kind of a drift
when you do things that way.

101
00:09:04.155 --> 00:09:07.587
It's better if you can deal with
deltas from absolute times,

102
00:09:07.587 --> 00:09:10.100
you'll get a more
accurate result that way.

103
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.208
So if remaining is less than 0 or
less than or equal to 0,

104
00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:22.290
I guess I should put, well,
then at that point the game has been lost.

105
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:27.039
So we'll just add a note to ourselves
TODO the game has been lost.

106
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.870
And we wanna stop
the countdown at that point.

107
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:35.602
So let's add another value.

108
00:09:35.602 --> 00:09:40.272
We'll do let playing,

109
00:09:42.287 --> 00:09:44.836
Is false.

110
00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:48.946
And then inside our loop,
if the game is no longer playing, then,

111
00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:55.895
We returned before calling
the requestAnimationFrame, and

112
00:09:55.895 --> 00:10:00.015
then down here playing becomes
false once we run out of time.

113
00:10:03.685 --> 00:10:09.371
I'm gonna add an on mount here,
that just calls countdown.

114
00:10:09.371 --> 00:10:14.040
And then we're gonna parse that remaining
value into our countdown component.

115
00:10:25.475 --> 00:10:28.790
It's not working because I forgot
to call the loop function.

116
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.298
VS Code has helpfully grayed it out so

117
00:10:30.298 --> 00:10:33.100
that I can see that it's
not being used anywhere.

118
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.989
If I now run that, hopefully,

119
00:10:35.989 --> 00:10:41.668
we're going to start seeing
that countdown bar to dwindle.

120
00:10:41.668 --> 00:10:43.276
Yes, we are, okay.

121
00:10:43.276 --> 00:10:44.710
So things are starting to come together.
