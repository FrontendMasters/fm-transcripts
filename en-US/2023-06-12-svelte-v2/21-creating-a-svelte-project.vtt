00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.654
So we've gone through the tutorial,

2
00:00:01.654 --> 00:00:03.830
we know everything there
is to know about Svelte.

3
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.180
Now it's time to use that knowledge
to actually build something.

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.270
And so
what we're gonna build is a little game.

5
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.760
We're gonna build a game called ematchi.

6
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.823
It is a matching game of the kind
that you've probably played before.

7
00:00:14.823 --> 00:00:19.979
You get a grid like this and
you reveal two cards at a time,

8
00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:25.148
and then you have to try and
remember where the pairs are.

9
00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:27.780
I got that right,
are up against the clock.

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.670
You can see the counter timing
down on the right hand side there.

11
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.669
And we're using a bunch of
different spell features here.

12
00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:38.720
We're using component composition,
we're using slots.

13
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.245
We're using transitions,
we're using animations,

14
00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:46.010
we're using life cycle functions,
loads of stuff.

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.027
So hopefully this is gonna be
a pretty good comprehensive summation

16
00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:55.699
of everything that we've learned
elsewhere in this session.

17
00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.583
We're gonna begin by creating a project
using a package called createsvelte.

18
00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:07.791
And the way that we use
it on the command line

19
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:12.862
is we type, npm create svelte@latest.

20
00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:17.864
I'm just gonna hit Enter there.

21
00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:21.765
And that's gonna get
the createsvelte package, and

22
00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:26.977
it's going to ask us where we want
to create our new SvelteKit project.

23
00:01:26.977 --> 00:01:32.324
I'm gonna create a directory called
ematchi, the name of the project.

24
00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:36.400
And we have a few options for what
kind of project we're going to create.

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.940
We're gonna use a skeleton project.

26
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.420
I'm gonna use TypeScript for this.

27
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.830
If you're not familiar with TypeScript,
it's all gonna be fairly easy to follow,

28
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.333
so don't worry about this.

29
00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.746
It's just gonna make things
a little bit easier.

30
00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:57.056
And I'm gonna add prettier to
keep our code nicely formatted.

31
00:01:57.056 --> 00:01:59.594
Okay, so it's scaffolded our project.

32
00:01:59.594 --> 00:02:01.567
I'm gonna open it in VS Code.

33
00:02:08.383 --> 00:02:14.599
And then I'm gonna install my
dependencies with pnpm install.

34
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.750
Now you don't have to use VS Code,
of course, although it is the editor that

35
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.743
I would generally recommend for
doing this stuff, mostly because we have

36
00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:30.160
a really good editor extension for
working with Svelte inside VS Code.

37
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.583
If you go to the extensions tab and
search for Svelte,

38
00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:38.250
You will see spelt for VS Code up here.

39
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.170
And I strongly recommend that
you install this extension.

40
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.137
It's gonna make your life a lot easier
when you're building things in Svelte.

41
00:02:47.137 --> 00:02:49.864
So this is a SvelteKit app
that we've just created, and

42
00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:53.357
we haven't covered SvelteKit yet,
and we're actually not going to.

43
00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:56.044
This is the way to build Svelte apps.

44
00:02:56.044 --> 00:02:59.181
But we're not gonna be learning
any of the SvelteKit features,

45
00:02:59.181 --> 00:03:01.981
we're just gonna be using
plain old Svelte in this demo.

46
00:03:09.182 --> 00:03:14.125
Most of our time is gonna be
spent in this page.svelte file.

47
00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:18.184
Right now we have some placeholder
content that says, welcome to SvelteKit.

48
00:03:18.184 --> 00:03:22.840
And if I fire up the development
server with pnpm dev, or

49
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.219
npm run dev, if you're not a pnpm user,

50
00:03:29.847 --> 00:03:34.627
Then that's opening a development
server on port 5,173,

51
00:03:34.627 --> 00:03:39.415
because we're using Vite, and
that is the port that Vite uses.

52
00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:42.318
So I'm gonna move this window
over to the left handside so

53
00:03:42.318 --> 00:03:45.169
that we can have our browser
open on the right handside.

54
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.098
I'm gonna open that to local 5,173, and

55
00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:57.491
you can see that we have our page
being rendered in the browser.

56
00:03:57.491 --> 00:04:00.944
If I make some changes here and save them,
you'll see that the page updates.
