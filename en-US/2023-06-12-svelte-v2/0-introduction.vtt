00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.975
Welcome, everyone to this Svelte workshop.

2
00:00:01.975 --> 00:00:05.399
Coming to you from Gorgeous, Minneapolis,
one of the things you cannot tell from

3
00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.120
watching frontend masters videos, is that
we are not in fact in a great prison.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.586
We are on the 36th floor
of a building in downtown,

5
00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:15.015
Minneapolis with some stunning views,
especially on a day like today.

6
00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:17.199
I've been looking forward to this for
a really long time.

7
00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.278
I'm really happy that you can join us,

8
00:00:19.278 --> 00:00:22.120
hopefully we're gonna have
some fun in this course.

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.301
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together, so

10
00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:27.440
let me introduce myself a little bit.

11
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.840
My name is Rich, I'm a principal
software engineer at the cell.

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.387
I live in New York City,
Brooklyn, specifically,

13
00:00:34.387 --> 00:00:37.150
though as you can tell from my accent,
I am not from there.

14
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.951
Things I love include music, I'm
a trombonist, there's no trombone emoji,

15
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:49.311
so we have to settle for this nonsense,
I like climbing, cycling, swimming,

16
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:54.051
cooking, cheese, beer, mountains,
and I love writing software.

17
00:00:54.051 --> 00:00:57.221
I got into software in a little
bit of a roundabout way.

18
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:02.136
After university, I fell into journalism
at a time when the gray-haired men running

19
00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:06.920
newsrooms were trying to figure out
this thing called the Internet.

20
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.500
And there was a lot of cache in
being able to understand computers.

21
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.754
And some of the most forward looking
newsrooms were using JavaScript to do new

22
00:01:14.754 --> 00:01:19.271
kinds of journalism, that involved
interactivity, and personalization, and

23
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:21.780
visual presentations of data.

24
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870
I was young, and I was hungry,
and I wanted a piece of it.

25
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.740
So I started learning web development
with the help of some friends.

26
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.205
And what I very quickly discovered is that
it is really hard, too hard to build apps

27
00:01:32.205 --> 00:01:36.089
on the web that work reliably across
browsers and across form factors,

28
00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:39.845
especially when you're dealing
with things like transitions, and

29
00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:44.000
animations as a core primitive for
communicating concepts.

30
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.644
And this is doubly true when you're
working in the high-pressure environment

31
00:01:46.644 --> 00:01:49.930
of a newsroom, where you're constantly
working towards a deadline.

32
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.582
So right from the very beginning of my
journey as a software development, I have

33
00:01:53.582 --> 00:01:57.510
been passionate about making it easier for
people to build things on the web.

34
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.002
Not just people who build things on
the web for a living, but also people who

35
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:04.570
aren't constantly immersed in the soap
opera of front-end development.

36
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.870
All of that is what led to
the origin of Svelte in 2016.

37
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.091
Svelte began almost as an experiment
designed to answer the following question,

38
00:02:14.091 --> 00:02:16.550
what if we let compilers
do the hard work for us?

39
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.739
I've been working on it for almost seven
years at this point, for most of that time

40
00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.743
it was kind of a side project, for the
last 18 months or so, it's been my full

41
00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:28.594
time gig at the cell, which has been
a friend of the project for a long time.

42
00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:32.725
A lot of things have changed during that
time but the mission has stayed the same,

43
00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:35.106
to make building stuff on the web easy and
fun.

44
00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:38.933
Luckily, I haven't had to do it alone,
Svelte and SvelteKit have had hundreds of

45
00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:42.818
contributors supported by an army of
community builders, and content creators,

46
00:02:42.818 --> 00:02:46.536
and financial backers, through tens of
thousands of Svelte developers around

47
00:02:46.536 --> 00:02:50.360
the world, if not more, and it's
a really fun community to be a part of.

48
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.016
And if you go to svelte.dev/chat, you can
join our Discord, and in fact, I believe

49
00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:59.430
there are some people in the Discord
watching this together live right now, hi?

50
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.666
They even made a documentary about us,
which you can watch on YouTube,

51
00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:05.650
it's called Svelte Origins.

52
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.920
So that's the back story.

53
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.334
If you're here, I'm gonna assume that you
are interested in learning Svelte and

54
00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:13.599
SvelteKit, and so I'm not gonna blather
on anymore about why you should learn

55
00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.480
those things, instead,
we're gonna get into some housekeeping.

56
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.470
Firstly, who is this course for?

57
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.158
Well, it's for
everyone who builds stuff on the web, or

58
00:03:22.158 --> 00:03:23.677
wants to build stuff on the web.

59
00:03:23.677 --> 00:03:26.210
If you've never used a framework before,
that's fine.

60
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.510
If your day job is working with
things like React, that's also fine.

61
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.291
The only real requirement is that
you do need to know html, CSS,

62
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:36.740
and at least a bit of JavaScript.

63
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.600
Later on, you will need to be able
to use Node in the command line,

64
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.990
you do not need to be
an expert in those things.

65
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.370
We're also gonna dabble with
a little bit of TypeScript.

66
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.304
Although, again,
if you're not a TypeScript wizard,

67
00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:47.670
don't let that put you off.

68
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.762
It's gonna be fine.

69
00:03:48.762 --> 00:03:50.684
We're gonna cover the basic concepts,

70
00:03:50.684 --> 00:03:54.189
then we're gonna learn some advanced
techniques, and then we're gonna

71
00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:57.989
put it all together by building a game,
specifically this game called Emachi.

72
00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.890
We've got a lot of material to get
through, so let's get into it.

73
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.770
Internet are you ready?

74
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.130
Attendees are you ready?

75
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.840
Don't think the Internet can hear you,
attendees are you ready?

76
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

77
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.358
&gt;&gt; All right, let's get into it.
