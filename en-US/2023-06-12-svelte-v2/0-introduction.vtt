00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.020
Welcome, everyone to the Svelte workshop
coming to you from gorgeous Minneapolis.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.287
One of the things you cannot tell from
watching Frontend Masters videos is that,

3
00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:09.120
we are not in fact in a gray prison.

4
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.677
We are on the 36th floor of a building in
downtown Minneapolis with some stunning

5
00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:14.440
views, especially on a day like today.

6
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.220
I've been looking forward to this for
a really long time.

7
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.289
I'm really happy that you can join us,

8
00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.120
hopefully we're gonna have
some fun in this course.

9
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.301
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time together, so

10
00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:27.440
let me introduce myself a little bit.

11
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.840
My name is Rich, I am
a Principal Software Engineer at Vercel.

12
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.326
I live in New York City,
Brooklyn specifically,

13
00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:37.150
though as you can tell from my accent,
I am not from there.

14
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.421
Things I love include music, I'm
a trombonist, there's no trombone emoji,

15
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:45.190
so, we have to settle for this nonsense.

16
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.479
I like climbing, cycling,
swimming, cooking, cheese, beer,

17
00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.200
mountains, and I love writing software.

18
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.380
I got into software, in
a little bit of a roundabout way.

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.147
After university I fell into journalism,
at a time when the gray haired men running

20
00:01:02.147 --> 00:01:06.920
newsrooms were trying to figure out
this thing called the Internet.

21
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.500
And there was a lot of cachet and
being able to understand computers.

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.939
And some of the most forward looking
newsrooms, were using JavaScript to do new

23
00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.247
kinds of journalism, that involved
interactivity and personalization and

24
00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:21.780
visual presentations of data.

25
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.870
I was young and I was hungry and
I wanted a piece of it.

26
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.060
So, I started learning web development
with the help of some friends and

27
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.085
what I very quickly discovered is that,
it is really hard,

28
00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:35.652
too hard to build apps on the web that
work reliably across browsers and

29
00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:40.070
across form factors especially when you're
dealing with things like transitions and

30
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.000
animations as a core primitive for
communicating concepts.

31
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.628
This is doubly true when you're working
in the high pressure environment of

32
00:01:46.628 --> 00:01:49.930
a newsroom, where you're constantly
working towards a deadline.

33
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.634
So, right from the very beginning of my
journey as a software development, I have

34
00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:57.510
been passionate about making it easier for
people to build things on the web.

35
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.374
Not just people who build things
on the web for a living, but

36
00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:04.570
also people who aren't constantly immersed
in the soap opera front end development.

37
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.870
All of that is what led to
the origin of Svelte in 2016.

38
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.993
Svelte began almost as an experiment
designed to answer the following question.

39
00:02:13.993 --> 00:02:16.550
What if we let compilers
do the hard work for us?

40
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.460
I've been working on it for
almost 7 years at this point.

41
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.841
For most of that time, it was kind of
a side project, for the last 18 months or

42
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:25.840
so, it's been my full-time
gig at Vercel,

43
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.820
which has been a friend of the project for
a long time.

44
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.059
A lot of things have changed during that
time, but the mission has stayed the same,

45
00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:33.880
to make building stuff on the web easy and
fun.

46
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.360
Luckily, I haven't had to do it alone.

47
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.524
Svelte and SvelteKit have had hundreds
of contributors supported by an army of

48
00:02:41.524 --> 00:02:45.330
community builders and
content creators and financial backers.

49
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.227
There are tens of thousands of Svelte
developers around the world, if not more,

50
00:02:48.227 --> 00:02:50.370
and it's a really fun
community to be a part of.

51
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.880
And if you go to svelte.dev/chat,
you can join our discord.

52
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.764
And in fact, I believe there are some
people in the discord watching this

53
00:02:57.764 --> 00:02:59.430
together live right now, hi.

54
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.690
They've made a documentary about this,
which you can watch on YouTube,

55
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.650
it's called Svelte Origins.

56
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.920
So, that's the back story.

57
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.301
If you're here, I'm gonna assume that you
are interested in learning Svelte and

58
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:10.840
SvelteKit.

59
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.270
And so, I'm not gonna blather on anymore
about why you should learn those things,

60
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.480
instead, we're gonna get
into some housekeeping.

61
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.470
Firstly, who is this course for?

62
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.744
Well, it's for
everyone who builds stuff on the web or

63
00:03:21.744 --> 00:03:23.570
wants to build stuff on the web.

64
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.210
If you've never used a framework before,
that's fine.

65
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.510
If your day job is working things with
things like React, that's also fine.

66
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.291
The only real requirement is that
you do need to know HTML, CSS,

67
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:36.740
and at least a bit of JavaScript.

68
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.820
Later on, you will need to be able
to use Node and the command line.

69
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.990
You do not need to be
an expert in those things.

70
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.370
We're also gonna dabble with
a little bit of TypeScript.

71
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.670
Although again, if you're not a TypeScript
wizard, don't let that put you off.

72
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:48.890
It's gonna be fine.

73
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.350
We're gonna cover the basic concepts.

74
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.180
Then we're gonna learn
some advanced techniques.

75
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.176
And then, we're gonna put it all
together by building a game, and

76
00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:58.050
specifically this game called ematchi.

77
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.890
Got a lot of material to get through,
so let's get into it.

78
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.770
Internet, are you ready?

79
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.990
Attendees, are you ready?

80
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.620
Don't think the Internet I can hear you.

81
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.840
Attendees, are you ready?

82
00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.382
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

83
00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.198
&gt;&gt; All right.

84
00:04:10.198 --> 00:04:11.070
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE].
&gt;&gt; Let's get into it.
