1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.184
Okay, so things are mostly looking good.

2
00:00:02.184 --> 00:00:06.624
But we would like to add some of the
polish that we saw in the original app.

3
00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:13.235
So if you remember, in the one that
we've got deployed, when we find a pair,

4
00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:19.157
then it kind of transitions nicely
from the grid into that boundary.

5
00:00:19.157 --> 00:00:21.705
And we can do this with spelt transitions.

6
00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.772
So let's, let's build that now.

7
00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:30.486
The first thing we're going to need
to do is create a pair of send and

8
00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:34.648
receive transitions just like we saw
in the example with the to do list.

9
00:00:34.648 --> 00:00:40.526
So we'll create a new module,
call it transitions.ts.

10
00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:45.647
And inside there,
we're gonna import the crossfade function.

11
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.274
From svelte transition,
Along with cubicOut.

12
00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:08.780
From svelte/easing, and we're gonna create
a pair of send and receive transitions.

13
00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:13.868
By calling crossfade.

14
00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:28.291
Give it a duration of 400 see how that
looks, and then an easing of cubicOut.

15
00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:35.644
Okay, and
now when something leaves the grid,

16
00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:39.329
we want it to appear in the found array.

17
00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.182
First, we need to add the send

18
00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:49.045
transition from the square.

19
00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:53.849
And you'll recall that, We do

20
00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.739
that by adding out:send,

21
00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.420
and then providing a key.

22
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.977
Let's for now we'll just use
the emoji itself as a key.

23
00:02:08.977 --> 00:02:17.514
We need to import the send function,
From transitions.

24
00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:24.005
We've got to export it.

25
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.682
So we'll do that now and
then we need to have the corresponding

26
00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:37.497
receive transition in the found array so
open that up.

27
00:02:39.558 --> 00:02:41.014
Same deal.

28
00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.242
When it comes in, we'll do a receive,

29
00:02:48.242 --> 00:02:53.425
just auto complete that,
import it from transitions.

30
00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:57.876
And we'll give it the same key.

31
00:03:02.295 --> 00:03:06.710
Let's see what happens now that
we've added those transitions.

32
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.294
First we need to find a matching pair,

33
00:03:10.294 --> 00:03:15.455
I think that was the monkey
no that was the monkey okay.

34
00:03:15.455 --> 00:03:17.739
All right, almost works.

35
00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.620
Only one of the monkeys went
down into that found array.

36
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.111
One thing I just noticed is that
this needs a height of 100% so

37
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:29.366
that it's properly centered.

38
00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:32.819
And the reason for that is that
when we create a pair of send and

39
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.565
receive transitions,
it operates on this map of counterparts.

40
00:03:36.565 --> 00:03:38.582
And if you have two
elements with the same key,

41
00:03:38.582 --> 00:03:41.500
it's a little bit like having a keyed
each block with the same key.

42
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.436
It just gets confused.

43
00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:45.486
It doesn't know which elements
it's supposed to be transitioning.

44
00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:50.336
So we need to be able to distinguish them
a little bit better, and we need to have.

45
00:03:50.336 --> 00:03:56.075
Two elements in the found array for
the images in the grid to correspond to.

46
00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:00.200
So we're gonna add a new element here,

47
00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.063
let's call it div class=pair And

48
00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:12.385
inside that,
we're gonna have two copies of this image.

49
00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:16.385
And those need to have two unique keys.

50
00:04:16.385 --> 00:04:22.348
So let's call them

51
00:04:22.348 --> 00:04:28.686
emoji a and emoji b.

52
00:04:28.686 --> 00:04:34.140
We'll add some styles to that per element

53
00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:40.731
And then the images we're
gonna have position absolute.

54
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:49.766
Left, top, 0 and the width and
height are gonna be 100%.

55
00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:53.500
Okay, so you've got two monkeys
stacked on top of each other now.

56
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.669
And they're gonna have
separate transitions, but

57
00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.485
we need to have some way
of representing this.

58
00:04:59.485 --> 00:05:04.539
inside the grid, in other words here.

59
00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:09.749
And so we're gonna need to be able to
pass that information in from the grid.

60
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:14.986
We'll add a new prop to
the square.svel component.

61
00:05:14.986 --> 00:05:16.536
We'll call it group.

62
00:05:19.086 --> 00:05:22.687
A group could be either a or b.

63
00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:32.622
And then we'll use that in the key that
we passed to the same trasnsition.

64
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:42.222
Right now, of course,
if we open the grid.svelte,

65
00:05:42.222 --> 00:05:46.250
it's gonna complain that we're
not passing in the group.

66
00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:53.485
And there's a few different
ways that we could solve this.

67
00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:57.111
The way that I'm gonna
do it is if the current

68
00:05:57.111 --> 00:06:02.013
iteration in this loop is
the first instance of this emoji.

69
00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:06.101
It's gonna be the a group,
otherwise it's gonna be the b group.

70
00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:11.811
And the way that we can do this is if grid

71
00:06:11.811 --> 00:06:17.356
index of emoji is the current index,

72
00:06:19.467 --> 00:06:23.297
Then it's group a,
otherwise, it's group b.

73
00:06:24.813 --> 00:06:29.636
And then maybe if we find another pair,
all right,

74
00:06:29.636 --> 00:06:34.135
it's starting to look
like it's supposed to.

75
00:06:38.524 --> 00:06:43.920
We can add a little bit more
styling to our found array,

76
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.567
give it a little bit of a drop shadow.

77
00:06:59.445 --> 00:07:05.126
And each of these will
turn into a white disk.

78
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.749
I'm just going to get rid of the position.

79
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:32.882
We'll get rid of the left and
the top here and

80
00:07:32.882 --> 00:07:37.809
we'll give these some
slightly different widths.

81
00:07:44.462 --> 00:07:47.557
We'll make this a display flex container.

82
00:07:59.056 --> 00:08:03.657
And it's starting to look a little
bit more like the original.
