1
00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:04.337
We don't have much of a game at this
point because the emojis are facing us.

2
00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.729
We need to make this start
to resemble a real game.

3
00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.692
And to do that, we're gonna have
the cards on their backs by default.

4
00:00:12.692 --> 00:00:15.527
And if you recall from the original demo,

5
00:00:15.527 --> 00:00:18.688
these kind of flip over
using CSS transforms.

6
00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:21.624
So we're gonna need to set a few
things up to make that work.

7
00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:29.223
The first thing we need to do is we need
to add some perspective on our grid.

8
00:00:29.223 --> 00:00:32.146
And there's CSS property
called perspective,

9
00:00:32.146 --> 00:00:36.360
we're gonna give it a value of 100 vw,
it doesn't really matter.

10
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.979
It just affects how severe
the distortion is when things

11
00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.678
are flipping over using CSS transforms.

12
00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:47.124
And then inside our square component,

13
00:00:47.124 --> 00:00:50.391
I'm just gonna close all of the junk
up here cuz I don't need anymore.

14
00:00:54.412 --> 00:01:00.782
We're gonna add some CSS transforms that
simulate the card being flipped around.

15
00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:12.019
In order to see the flip happen,
we're gonna need to add a transition.

16
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.454
Let's do something like that, transition
the transform property for 0.4 seconds.

17
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.075
So far nothing's happening,
and I think that's because

18
00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:36.743
we need to add a transform
style on here of preserve-3d

19
00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:44.528
CSS transforms especially
when we're dealing with 3D,

20
00:01:44.528 --> 00:01:48.948
is the kind of stuff that I have to look
at NDN at each time, I can never remember

21
00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:54.041
how to get it right, Clearly,
I haven't got it right at this point.

22
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.884
It's because we're applying the transform
only to the button instead of to

23
00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.058
the entire flipped element.

24
00:02:07.058 --> 00:02:12.841
So we're gonna change that selector so
that we're targeting flipped and

25
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:16.301
you'll see that cow flipped around there.

26
00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:21.446
Okay, so it's starting to look
a little bit like what we want except

27
00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:26.433
that the emojis shouldn't be
visible until the card is flipped.

28
00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:31.240
So to make that work,
we need to have a default

29
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.694
transform on the image of rotateY(180deg).

30
00:02:36.694 --> 00:02:40.859
And we also need to add a property
called backface visibility,

31
00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.516
which should be hidden.

32
00:02:48.666 --> 00:02:55.150
Okay, so now the emoji is not
visible until the card is flipped.

33
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.795
One thing that we don't want to happen is
for the button to continue being visible

34
00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:01.912
after we flip, because we don't want
you to be able to click on that.

35
00:03:01.912 --> 00:03:06.722
So the button is also gonna get
a back face visibility hidden.

36
00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:17.091
And that means that the background that
we put in earlier is now showing through.

37
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.365
So let's make that a nicer color.

38
00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:27.450
In fact, we're gonna need to add
another element for that background.

39
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.668
Let's call it div class=background

40
00:03:43.337 --> 00:03:45.548
And just like the image,

41
00:03:45.548 --> 00:03:51.561
that's only gonna become visible
when the card as a whole is flipped

42
00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:05.009
Okay, we're getting there, but we need
to add some more styles here clearly.

43
00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:08.558
Let's do width 100%, height 100%,

44
00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:12.843
and we'll slap in a position
absolute in there as well.

45
00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.382
Okay, things are starting to behave.

46
00:04:22.382 --> 00:04:26.645
But what we're finding is that some
of these cards are still flippable

47
00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:29.546
even though we've already
found those pairs.

48
00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:33.426
So we actually want to remove those.

49
00:04:33.426 --> 00:04:37.723
Or rather we wanna keep them
flipped once they've been found.

50
00:04:37.723 --> 00:04:42.483
So we're gonna keep
the flipped class active when

51
00:04:42.483 --> 00:04:47.936
the square has either been selected or
it's been found.

52
00:04:47.936 --> 00:04:52.996
And do that like that and so
now you can see which cards have

53
00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:58.283
already been found, and
which ones still need to be found.

54
00:04:58.283 --> 00:05:02.810
Okay, we're gonna get rid of
these default ugly button styles.

55
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.506
We're gonna give that a background
of #eee and get rid of the border,

56
00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:15.995
and let's give it a border radius
as well while we're at it of 1em.

57
00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:21.311
Okay, that's starting to look a little bit
like what we had on the published version.

58
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:26.235
We'll add that border-radius
to the background when

59
00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:28.810
the card is flipped as well.

60
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.039
We're actually going to change
that background to white and

61
00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:40.275
give it a border of, eee.

62
00:05:40.275 --> 00:05:44.092
Let's make that a little bit bigger maybe,
a little bit thicker.

63
00:05:51.844 --> 00:05:55.162
Okay, we're starting to get a little
bit closer to what we had before.

64
00:06:00.752 --> 00:06:04.913
The border-radius isn't quite the same
between the button and the div.

65
00:06:04.913 --> 00:06:07.895
And that's because,
by default in the browser,

66
00:06:07.895 --> 00:06:12.514
buttons have a font size that does not
inherit from the surrounding content.

67
00:06:12.514 --> 00:06:14.471
So we need to add that explicitly.

68
00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:16.933
font-size inherit.

69
00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:22.221
Now everything is using
the same border-radius.

70
00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:31.385
In the same vein,

71
00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:35.223
we wanna get rid of the default styles
on the button in the countdown.

72
00:06:37.594 --> 00:06:42.192
Give it a background of transparent and
a border of none.

73
00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:48.345
And the countdown button now
looks a little bit nicer.

74
00:06:48.345 --> 00:06:51.365
At the moment, it doesn't do anything
because we haven't wired up any event

75
00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:52.996
handlers, but we'll come to that soon.
