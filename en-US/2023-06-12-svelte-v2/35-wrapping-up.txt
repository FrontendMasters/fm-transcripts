>> There's one last little detail that I would like to add to this and that is I wanna reward the player if they succeed with a little bit of confetti. So we're gonna install the Neo confetti package. Again, I'm using pmpm, but you can use npm. So that is @neoconfetti/svelte.

[00:00:35]
And we're gonna import that into the page.svelte component. And then if we get into the win state, state is won. Then we're gonna create a confetti element. Gonna give it some styles, make it fill the screen. Offset it so that it's in the center and then make sure that it doesn't intersect any points or events.

[00:01:36]
And then the way that we use the confetti library it's an action, use confetti. We give it a stage width, which is equal to the Window's inner width, stage height which is equal to the Window's inner height. And then hopefully, if we've done this right, and we play another game and we win, we're gonna see some confetti.

[00:02:12]
All right, so we're looking for a badger, That goes there, I don't think we've seen that yet. The squirrel I think was this guy. All right, we have some confetti.
