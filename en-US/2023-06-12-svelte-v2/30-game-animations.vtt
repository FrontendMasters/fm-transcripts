00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.550
We don't have much of a game at this
point because the emojis are facing us.

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.940
We need to make this start
to resemble a real game.

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.720
And to do that, we're gonna have
the cards on their backs by default.

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.301
And if you recall from the original demo,

5
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:18.670
these kind of flip over
using CSS transforms.

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.530
So we're gonna need to set a few
things up to make that work.

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.640
The first thing we need to do is we need
to add some perspective on our grid.

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.380
And there's a CSS property
called perspective.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.517
We're gonna give it a value of 100 vw.

10
00:00:35.517 --> 00:00:40.416
Doesn't really matter, it just affects
how severe the distortion is when things

11
00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:42.905
are flipping over using CSS transforms.

12
00:00:45.247 --> 00:00:47.088
And then inside our square component,

13
00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:50.508
I'm just gonna close all of the junk
up here cuz I don't need it anymore.

14
00:00:54.296 --> 00:01:00.844
We are gonna add some CSS transforms that
simulate the card being flipped around.

15
00:01:08.893 --> 00:01:11.975
In order to see the flip happen,
we're gonna need to add a transition.

16
00:01:15.612 --> 00:01:20.317
Let's do something like that, transition
the transform property for 0.4 seconds.

17
00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:32.117
So far nothing's happening and
I think that's because we

18
00:01:32.117 --> 00:01:36.637
need to add a transform style
on here of preserve 3D.

19
00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:46.186
CSS transforms especially when we're
dealing with 3D is the kind of stuff that

20
00:01:46.186 --> 00:01:48.258
I have to look at MDN at each time.

21
00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:50.982
I can never remember how to get it right,

22
00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:54.119
clearly I haven't got
it right at this point.

23
00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.886
It's because we're applying the transform
only to the button instead of to

24
00:02:05.886 --> 00:02:07.084
the entire flipped element.

25
00:02:07.084 --> 00:02:10.847
So we're gonna change that selector so
that we're targeting flipped, and

26
00:02:10.847 --> 00:02:13.271
you'll see that that cow
flipped around there.

27
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.379
Okay, so it's starting to look
a little bit like what we want except

28
00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.430
that the emojis shouldn't be
visible until the card is flipped.

29
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.541
So to make that work,
we need to have a default

30
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:35.420
transform on the image of
rotate y by 180 degrees.

31
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.446
And we also need to add a property
called backface-visibility which

32
00:02:41.446 --> 00:02:42.711
should be hidden.

33
00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:53.318
Okay, so now the emoji is not
visible until the card is flipped.

34
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.524
One thing that we don't want to happen
is for the button to continue being

35
00:02:58.524 --> 00:03:01.928
visible after we flip because we don't
want you to be able to click on that.

36
00:03:01.928 --> 00:03:06.566
So the button is also gonna get
a backface-visibility hidden.

37
00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:19.105
And that means that the background that
we put in earlier is now showing through.

38
00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:21.440
So let's make that a nicer color.

39
00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.700
In fact, we're gonna need to add
another element for that background.

40
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:34.667
Let's call it div class equals background.

41
00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:48.319
And, just like the image that's
only gonna become visible

42
00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.285
when the card as a whole is flipped.

43
00:04:02.162 --> 00:04:03.962
Okay, we're getting there but
we need to add some more styles.

44
00:04:03.962 --> 00:04:08.615
So clearly, let's do width 100%,
height 100% and

45
00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:12.639
we'll slap in a position
absolute in there as well.

46
00:04:20.533 --> 00:04:22.431
Okay, things are starting to behave.

47
00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:27.046
But what we're finding is that some of
these cards are still flippable even

48
00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:29.697
though we've already found those pairs.

49
00:04:29.697 --> 00:04:32.660
So we actually want to remove those or

50
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.547
rather we wanna keep them
flipped once they've been found.

51
00:04:37.547 --> 00:04:41.712
So we're gonna keep
the flipped class active when

52
00:04:41.712 --> 00:04:46.480
the square has either been selected or
it's been found.

53
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.514
And do that like that and so
now you can see which cards have

54
00:04:52.514 --> 00:04:57.180
already been found, and
which ones still need to be found.

55
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.640
Okay, we wanna get rid of these
default ugly button styles.

56
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.930
We're gonna give that a background
of eee and get rid of the border.

57
00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.270
And let's give it a border radius as
well while we're at it of one ems.

58
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.510
Okay, that's starting to look a little bit
like what we had on the published version.

59
00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.422
We'll add that border radius to
the background when the card is

60
00:05:26.422 --> 00:05:27.820
flipped as well.

61
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.582
We're actually gonna change

62
00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:37.153
that background to white and

63
00:05:37.153 --> 00:05:40.970
give it a border of eee.

64
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.845
Let's make that a little bit bigger maybe,
a little bit thicker.

65
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.783
Okay, we're starting to get a little
bit closer to what we had before.

66
00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:05.306
The border radius isn't quite the same
between the button and the div, and

67
00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:07.946
that's because by default in the browser,

68
00:06:07.946 --> 00:06:12.603
buttons have a font size that does not
inherit from the surrounding content.

69
00:06:12.603 --> 00:06:16.785
So we need to add that explicitly,
font size inherit.

70
00:06:19.353 --> 00:06:22.166
Now everything is using
the same border radius.

71
00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:36.165
In the same vein, we wanna get rid
of the default styles on the button

72
00:06:36.165 --> 00:06:42.605
in the countdown to give it a background
of transparent and a border of none.

73
00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:48.428
And the countdown button now
looks a little bit nicer.

74
00:06:48.428 --> 00:06:51.451
At the moment it doesn't do anything
because you haven't wired up any event

75
00:06:51.451 --> 00:06:53.115
handlers, but we'll come to that soon.
