00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
So we've gone through the tutorial,

2
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.990
we know everything there
is to know about Svelte.

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.180
Now it's time to use that knowledge
to actually build something.

4
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.076
And so,
what we're gonna build is a little game.

5
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.260
We're gonna build a game called ematchi.

6
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.197
It is a matching game of the kind
that you probably played before,

7
00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:20.320
you get a grid like this and
you reveal two cards at a time.

8
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.630
And then you have to try and
remember where the pairs are.

9
00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.045
I got that right.

10
00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:28.703
We're up against the clock,

11
00:00:28.703 --> 00:00:32.294
you can see the counter timing
down on the right hand side there.

12
00:00:32.294 --> 00:00:35.760
And we're using a bunch of
different Svelte features here.

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.922
We're using component composition, we're
using slots, we're using transitions,

14
00:00:40.922 --> 00:00:46.010
we're using animations, we're using
lifecycle functions, loads of stuff.

15
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.023
So, hopefully this is
gonna be a pretty good,

16
00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:54.840
comprehensive summation of everything that
we've learned elsewhere in this session.

17
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.024
We're gonna begin by creating a project
using a package called Create Svelte.

18
00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:07.812
And the way that we use
it on the command line

19
00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:12.208
is we type npm create svelte@Latest.

20
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.410
I'm just gonna hit Enter there.

21
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.809
And that's gonna get
the Create Svelte package and

22
00:01:21.809 --> 00:01:26.966
it's going to ask us where we want
to create our new SvelteKit project.

23
00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:30.460
I'm gonna create a directory called
ematchi, the name of the project.

24
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.400
And we have a few options for what
kind of project we're going to create.

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.940
We're gonna use a skeleton project.

26
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.467
I'm gonna use TypeScript for this.

27
00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:45.950
If you're not familiar with TypeScript,
it's all gonna be fairly easy to follow.

28
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.120
So don't worry about this, it's just
gonna make things a little bit easier.

29
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.068
And I'm gonna to add Prettier to
keep our code nicely formatted.

30
00:01:57.174 --> 00:01:59.321
Okay, so it's scaffolded our project.

31
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:01.420
I'm gonna to open it in VS Code.

32
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.489
And then I'm gonna to install my
dependencies with pnpm install.

33
00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.742
Now you don't have to use VS Code of
course, although it is the editor that

34
00:02:19.742 --> 00:02:24.745
I would generally recommend for
doing these stuff, mostly because we

35
00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:29.857
have a really good editor extension for
working Svelte inside VS Code.

36
00:02:29.857 --> 00:02:34.402
If you go to the Extensions tab and
search for Svelte,

37
00:02:34.402 --> 00:02:38.250
you will see Svelte for VS Code up here.

38
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.170
And I strongly recommend that
you install this extension.

39
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.940
It's gonna make your life a lot easier
when you're building things in Svelte.

40
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.284
So this is a SvelteKit app
that we've just created.

41
00:02:50.284 --> 00:02:53.585
And we haven't covered SvelteKit yet,
and we're actually not going to.

42
00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:56.170
This is the way to build Svelte apps.

43
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.860
But we're not gonna be learning
any of these SvelteKit features.

44
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.891
We're just gonna be using
plain old Svelte in this demo.

45
00:03:09.178 --> 00:03:14.020
Most of our time is gonna be
spent in this page.svelte file.

46
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.290
Right now we have some placeholder
content that says Welcome to SvelteKit.

47
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.662
And if I fire up the development
server with pnpm dev, or

48
00:03:22.662 --> 00:03:25.832
npm run dev, if you're not a pnpm user.

49
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.828
Then that's opening a development
server on port 5173,

50
00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:39.860
because we're using VT and
that is the port that VT uses.

51
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.094
So I'm gonna move this window
over to the left-hand side so

52
00:03:43.094 --> 00:03:46.273
that we can have our browser
open on the right-hand side.

53
00:03:46.273 --> 00:03:50.663
I'm gonna open that to local 5173.

54
00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:57.769
And you can see that we have our
page being rendered in the browser.

55
00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.969
If I make some changes here and save them,
you'll see that the page updates.
