00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.477
There's one last little detail that
I would like to add to this and

2
00:00:05.477 --> 00:00:12.066
that is I wanna reward the player if they
succeed with a little bit of confetti.

3
00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:17.710
So we're gonna install
the Neo confetti package.

4
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.745
Again, I'm using pmpm,
but you can use npm.

5
00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.370
So that is @neoconfetti/svelte.

6
00:00:35.142 --> 00:00:38.981
And we're gonna import that
into the page.svelte component.

7
00:00:54.372 --> 00:01:00.196
And then if we get into the win

8
00:01:00.196 --> 00:01:04.815
state, state is won.

9
00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:08.133
Then we're gonna create
a confetti element.

10
00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:25.444
Gonna give it some styles,
make it fill the screen.

11
00:01:25.444 --> 00:01:29.767
Offset it so that it's in the center and

12
00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:36.854
then make sure that it doesn't
intersect any points or events.

13
00:01:36.854 --> 00:01:44.143
And then the way that we use the confetti
library it's an action, use confetti.

14
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.893
We give it a stage width, which is
equal to the Window's inner width,

15
00:01:55.893 --> 00:02:01.950
stage height which is equal
to the Window's inner height.

16
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.810
And then hopefully,
if we've done this right, and

17
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.892
we play another game and we win,
we're gonna see some confetti.

18
00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:15.937
All right, so we're looking for a badger,

19
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.043
That goes there,
I don't think we've seen that yet.

20
00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:30.043
The squirrel I think was this guy.

21
00:02:33.725 --> 00:02:35.752
All right, we have some confetti.
