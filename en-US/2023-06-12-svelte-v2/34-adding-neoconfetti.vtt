00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.453
There's one last little detail that
I would like to add to this, and

2
00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:12.162
that is I wanna reward the player, if they
succeed, with a little bit of confetti.

3
00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:17.760
So we're gonna install
the Neoconfetti package.

4
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.187
Then I'm using pnpm but you can use npm.

5
00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:26.813
So that is @neoconfetti/svelte.

6
00:00:35.213 --> 00:00:39.496
And we're gonna import that
into the page.svelte component.

7
00:00:54.301 --> 00:00:59.789
And then if we get into the win state,

8
00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:08.403
state is won, Then we're gonna
create a confetti element.

9
00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:23.245
I'm gonna give it some styles,
make it fill the screen.

10
00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:28.252
Offset it so that it's in the center.

11
00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:37.295
And then make sure that it doesn't
intercept any points or events.

12
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:44.578
And then the way that we use the Confetti
library, it's an action, use:confetti.

13
00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:53.789
We give it a stageWidth,
which is equal to the window's innerWidth.

14
00:01:56.864 --> 00:02:02.034
StageHeight which is equal to,
The window's innerHeight.

15
00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:05.614
And then, hopefully,
if we've done this right,

16
00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:10.461
and we play another game and we win,
we're gonna see some confetti.

17
00:02:12.667 --> 00:02:16.108
All right, so we're looking for a badger.

18
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.832
That goes there.

19
00:02:25.832 --> 00:02:28.190
I don't think we've seen that yet.

20
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.750
The squirrel, I think, was this guy.

21
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.906
All right, we have some confetti.
