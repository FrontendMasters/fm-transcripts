00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.500
All right, so now that we've had
some time to think about this,

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.606
let's look at how it would work.

3
00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:08.487
So here we have a fixed color.

4
00:00:08.487 --> 00:00:11.368
Its hue is fixed at zero, which means red.

5
00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:15.830
And what we actually want is for
the hue to be 50,

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.198
which is a warm yellow
when the intensity is one.

7
00:00:20.198 --> 00:00:23.145
And we want it to be zero,
which is pure red,

8
00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:28.349
when the intensity is five to communicate
that this was a stronger migraine.

9
00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.897
And let's not worry for

10
00:00:29.897 --> 00:00:33.936
now about the migraines that
don't have an intensity at all.

11
00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:39.161
So we would need to use a calculation

12
00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.001
here with our intensity.

13
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:45.740
And let's think about this for a second.

14
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.967
So if we want 50 when
the intensity is one,

15
00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:53.942
then we would need to multiply it
with something and subtract it from

16
00:00:53.942 --> 00:00:59.290
something else cuz we wanted to
decrease as the intensity grows bigger.

17
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.526
So let's start with 60.

18
00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:05.761
Let's multiply the intensity by 10.

19
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:11.234
And that actually works pretty much.

20
00:01:11.234 --> 00:01:17.993
So when the intensity is five,
we get 60 minus 50, which gives us 10.

21
00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:19.310
Let's make this 50.

22
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.390
Then when the intensity is five,
we get zero.

23
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.009
And when the intensity is one, we get 40.

24
00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.240
So I think that's actually okay.

25
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.788
We could change the numbers a little
bit to get a range of 0 to 50, but

26
00:01:36.788 --> 00:01:40.272
it's not gonna look as nice,
so let's go with that.

27
00:01:40.272 --> 00:01:43.381
Now how do we go with
a completely different hue for

28
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:46.423
migraines that don't
have an intensity at all?

29
00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:51.416
We can provide a fallback for
the intensity, but it's actually some

30
00:01:51.416 --> 00:01:57.200
intensive math to figure out how to get,
for example, 200, which is blue.

31
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.517
Well, it's actually turquoise, but
we would need to figure out what to add.

32
00:02:05.517 --> 00:02:09.488
And then we would divide and
that sort of thing.

33
00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:12.803
Wouldn't it be nice if we were
able to provide the fallback for

34
00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:16.523
the entire calculation instead of
just the fallback for intensity?

35
00:02:16.523 --> 00:02:18.700
We can actually do that.

36
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.604
We can use a separate variable for
the hue,

37
00:02:21.604 --> 00:02:24.360
which would also make it easier to read.

38
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.314
And then we move the calculation here,
and we call hue here.

39
00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:34.967
And then we just say
whatever hue we want for

40
00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:38.420
migraines that don't
have an intensity at all.

41
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.347
And if we want a different saturation and
lightness as well, we could do that, too.

42
00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:45.063
We would just use a variable for
the entire color.

43
00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:47.000
And then we would provide
a fallback color.

44
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.405
So what are main takeaways from this?

45
00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:55.810
We can use variables to set color
components to create dynamic palettes.

46
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.632
And we can provide a fallback for

47
00:02:57.632 --> 00:03:01.440
an entire calculation through
an intermediate variable.

48
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.933
This is not just useful for colors,
it's useful more generally.

49
00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:08.581
Anytime we want to provide a fallback for
an entire calculation,

50
00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:11.301
we could either try to solve for
x essentially and

51
00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:15.730
figure out what value we need to
provide as a fallback for our variable.

52
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.926
Or we can just use
an intermediate variable and

53
00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:21.150
provide the fallback right there,
which is more readable as well.
