Here's a little exercise to use fullbacks.

2
00:00:02.631 --> 00:00:08.622
So remember this demo what do we
use corner size to set the size

3
00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:14.388
of a cutout corner how could
we have separate properties?

4
00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:17.074
Corner size X and corner size Y.

5
00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:22.847
Two sets different horizontal and
vertical sizes of the cutout corner and

6
00:00:22.847 --> 00:00:27.594
also at corner sized property
that can set both if we wanted to

7
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:32.640
kind of like a shorthand,
let's take a pause and try to do that.
