00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:03.234
To practice the concepts
we've discussed so far,

2
00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:07.835
there is another simple exercise of
a customizable bar chart component where

3
00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:10.966
we're gonna make a component
that looks like this.

4
00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:16.254
And most of the style is already there,
this is a little bit more code that

5
00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:21.903
we've seen in other demos because I
expect you to fiddle with it by yourself.

6
00:00:21.903 --> 00:00:27.545
You could also open CodePen and you can
look at the notes to see what to do.

7
00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:31.653
The way we use this bar chart component
is through this HTML, like I said,

8
00:00:31.653 --> 00:00:34.386
I'm using component in
the sort of liberal way.

9
00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:39.018
This is not an actual web component, but
it is a usable blob of HTML and CSS.

10
00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:44.455
And we wanna be able to vary how
the component behaves, for example,

11
00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:49.633
what the values are by specifying
custom properties in the HTML.

12
00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:55.586
And then the CSS just displays
the bar chart component as it should.

13
00:00:55.586 --> 00:01:01.160
And we should also be able to style it
without having to know its structure.

14
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.826
The best part of this exercise
is to fill in the CSS, so

15
00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:08.257
it's actually visualizing
these percentages.

16
00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:10.349
The Flexbox part is already done here.

17
00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:12.036
You don't need to use Flexbox.

18
00:01:12.036 --> 00:01:17.584
And the second part is to introduce
properties to further customize the chart.

19
00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:22.384
For example, you could use a bar
color property to customize

20
00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:25.959
the color of the bars,
a bar width property,

21
00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:31.250
a bar spacing property to customize
the spacing between the bars.

22
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.040
Or a band count property to specify how
many of these horizontal bands do we have.

23
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.108
