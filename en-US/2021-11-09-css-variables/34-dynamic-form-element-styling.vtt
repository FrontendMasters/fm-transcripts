00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.526
Another effect that forces us to
combine CSS and JavaScript and

2
00:00:04.526 --> 00:00:09.493
write CSS in JavaScript quite frequently
is when we want the form elements

3
00:00:09.493 --> 00:00:11.730
styling to depend on its value.

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.439
For example,

5
00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:16.230
we have a slider and we want to change
its styling based on its current value.

6
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.876
So custom properties allow us
to just set a value property and

7
00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:23.290
do everything else in CSS.

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.960
So we can go over every input in our page,
or we could go over just range inputs, but

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.410
in this case we're going over all inputs.

10
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.403
And we set a value custom
property with the current value.

11
00:00:35.403 --> 00:00:39.411
And then we also obviously need
to monitor the input event so

12
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:44.712
that we can update this value property
otherwise it wouldn't be very useful.

13
00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:46.623
And let's see how we can use that, so

14
00:00:46.623 --> 00:00:50.957
here we have a slider we've applied slight
a little bit of CSS to make it styleable.

15
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:55.220
And we have this fixed radial gradient.

16
00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:01.237
And the code that I've showed
you is already applied here.

17
00:01:02.607 --> 00:01:04.916
So what I want is for this.

18
00:01:07.015 --> 00:01:11.778
Gradient to adjust, so
that when I move the slider handle,

19
00:01:11.778 --> 00:01:14.460
it actually shows me how far I am.

20
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.668
So the value property would range from
0 to 100 because it's just reflecting

21
00:01:20.668 --> 00:01:22.330
the value of the sliders.

22
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.833
And right now in outage the mail, I just
have an input type equals range with no

23
00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:30.662
min and max specified so
I get the 0 to 100 that is the default.

24
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.241
I can go there and

25
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:42.140
multiply value with.

26
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.299
I have 0 to 100,
I wanna make it 0 to 100%.

27
00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.147
So just be more multiplying it by 1%.

28
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:57.469
And as you can see it adapts, it needs a
little bit of tweaking to make to actually

29
00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.680
look nice but the main idea is there.

30
00:02:02.993 --> 00:02:10.175
And similarly, if I wanted, I could modify
the actual hue of the color to also adapt.

31
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.194
Or I could style I don't know,

32
00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:17.800
the box shadow based on the value
like the sky's the limit.

33
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.664
The JavaScript just sets the value
like just the pure number,

34
00:02:21.664 --> 00:02:24.210
that you've selected on the slider.

35
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.806
And the CSS can then go crazy without
having to make any changes to

36
00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:28.810
the JavaScript.
