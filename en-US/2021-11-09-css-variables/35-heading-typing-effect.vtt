Here's another demo where I'm using a set
of two CSS animations to emulate typing.

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.037
This is common in some types of websites
where you want to apply it to headings and

3
00:00:14.037 --> 00:00:17.190
have this progressive reveal
one character at a time.

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.950
Right now,

5
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.820
the length of the heading is hard coded
which doesn't make it very reusable.

6
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.973
I mean I could override some
inline styles to reuse it but

7
00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:32.931
I would need to override
a bunch of things.

8
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:38.027
I will need to override the width,
I would need to override the transition

9
00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:42.480
to the animation duration,
I would need to override the steps.

10
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.987
It's messy.

11
00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:49.060
However, all we really need to pass to
the CSS here is the content length.

12
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.880
And we can do this with
something like this.

13
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.626
We can go over all the elements
that have a typing class and

14
00:00:56.626 --> 00:00:59.160
just read the length and write it.

15
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.341
It's a little more involved if you have
like crazy Unicode characters, but

16
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:04.660
the main idea is there.

17
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.417
All we need to do is set the length
property to how many characters do we

18
00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:11.720
actually have?

19
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.560
It gets a little bit more complicated
if the content can change after load.

20
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.504
If the user can modify it or
if it can change in response to something,

21
00:01:22.504 --> 00:01:25.224
then you would need to
use mutation observers.

22
00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:26.150
It's still doable.

23
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.790
It's a little bit more tricky.

24
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.776
But the simple case is where you have
headings that don't actually change you

25
00:01:32.776 --> 00:01:34.040
load them.

26
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.250
That's the content they will have for
the entire lifetime of the page.

27
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.340
So let's try to apply that.

28
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.580
And right now nothing
applies to the JavaScript.

29
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.984
So we're gonna go here and copy this.

30
00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.723
And we're gonna go here and run it.

31
00:01:52.457 --> 00:01:58.140
And now I should be able to go here and

32
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.308
do, length times 1 CH and

33
00:02:02.308 --> 00:02:06.293
it seems to work lovely.

34
00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:07.295
And similarly.

35
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:16.710
Basically I should replace all
these 25's with var length.

36
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.696
And now I can apply it to any heading
that I want without having to

37
00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:25.827
customize any inline styles
