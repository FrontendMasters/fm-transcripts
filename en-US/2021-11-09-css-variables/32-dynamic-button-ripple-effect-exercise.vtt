00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.102
Here I've already applied
the JavaScript code that we've seen.

2
00:00:04.102 --> 00:00:09.190
So it already sets mouse local x and
mouse local y and we are using them here

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.210
to create a gradient that is centered
in the place where I've clicked.

4
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.143
I'm using the active pseudo class so I can
see the gradient when my mouse pointer is

5
00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:23.030
down and
it disappears when my mouse pointer is up.

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.496
So we can use this code as a starting
point to create a ripple like that of

7
00:00:27.496 --> 00:00:28.720
material design.

8
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.170
First let's transform this
gradient to show an actual circle.

9
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.687
Right now we just have a gradient from
a semi-transparent white to completely

10
00:00:40.687 --> 00:00:42.140
transparent.

11
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.204
Let's use the same trick
that we've seen numerous

12
00:00:47.204 --> 00:00:52.384
times in this workshop where
we use Color Stop at zero

13
00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:57.696
to create hardlines and
now we already have a circle.

14
00:00:57.696 --> 00:01:01.036
So what is the material design ripple?

15
00:01:09.408 --> 00:01:11.940
In material design,
it's actually very fast.

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.013
We're gonna make an effect that's
much slower but it's basically

17
00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:22.086
this circle that starts from where
the mouse pointer went down, and

18
00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:27.260
then simultaneously it's a positive
fades and it's radius grows.

19
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.014
So it looks like this ripple
that just grows and disappears.

20
00:01:31.014 --> 00:01:34.684
So how can we do that with
the same amount of JavaScript and

21
00:01:34.684 --> 00:01:39.210
basically just with CSS and
the same JavaScript that we already have.
