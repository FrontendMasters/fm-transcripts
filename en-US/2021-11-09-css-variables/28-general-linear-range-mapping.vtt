1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.490
There is a more general formula.

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.410
Right now we've seen how to do
range mapping from zero to one.

3
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.290
If our range is zero to one,
we've seen how to get any range.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.357
But there is a more general formula
basically, if our range is min

5
00:00:14.357 --> 00:00:20.290
x to max x and we want to get min y
to max y, we could actually do that.

6
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.030
It's just math.

7
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.206
We can essentially solve this
the system of these two equations and

8
00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:29.750
we can get values for a and b.

9
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.340
However, I don't expect
you to actually do that.

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.460
I just wanted to show you that it's there,
it's possible.

11
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.331
I did make a little app that you could
use instead so that you could just input

12
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:46.202
the values you have for example, for
the values you have for p and the output

13
00:00:46.202 --> 00:00:51.024
values you wanna get and you can modify
these numbers and it just updates.

14
00:00:55.097 --> 00:01:01.128
And remember this,
this would be much easier to reason about

15
00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:06.463
if we had this up when we when
we did this migrant demo.

16
00:01:06.463 --> 00:01:11.590
So remember what we wanted
our variable was intensity.

17
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.556
When intensity was 1 we wanted to output.

18
00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:19.056
What did we want to output with for 1?

19
00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:27.140
50 I think, and then when intensity was 5,
we wanted to add 0.

20
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.490
Okay this expects length, so
I'm gonna make it names for now.

21
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.790
I did push a fix to this but it's not.

22
00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:41.377
It hasn't caught up, so we could actually
just get this and remove the amps.

23
00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:46.280
So here we had compromise with a different
formula because like I said it would have

24
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.779
been trickier to figure out the numbers.

25
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.431
But with the app, we can actually
just get exactly the numbers we want.

26
00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.338
Since it just gives us the formula and

27
00:02:01.338 --> 00:02:05.180
now this goes from 0 to
50 just like we wanted.

28
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.822
It doesn't look as pretty though so

29
00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:11.120
we might still wanna
stick with the other one.

30
00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:18.940
So, range mapping allows the same
variable to control multiple things.

31
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.056
This can be useful in a number of cases.

32
00:02:23.396 --> 00:02:28.116
And I just wanted to give some credit
because the spotlight demo was

33
00:02:28.116 --> 00:02:31.410
inspired From this code
pen which is not mine.

34
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.185
This is a lot fancier
