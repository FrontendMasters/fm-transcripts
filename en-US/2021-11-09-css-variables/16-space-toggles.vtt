00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:03.210
Let's talk a little bit
about space toggles.

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.448
So that's kind of a strange name,
space toggles.

3
00:00:05.448 --> 00:00:08.368
What does that mean?

4
00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:11.575
Space toggles allow us to turn
parts of a value on and off.

5
00:00:11.575 --> 00:00:18.355
It's a technique some would say a hack I
agree it's a hack but it's quite useful.

6
00:00:18.355 --> 00:00:23.753
So let's see how these work again
we have the same two lines of code

7
00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:29.949
you're used to that now and then effects
and color is set to an empty value.

8
00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:30.780
What do we get?

9
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.030
We get the full back the empty value is
basically treated the same as initial.

10
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.986
Until recently,
it was actually a part time error, but

11
00:00:43.986 --> 00:00:46.945
we changed that behavior very recently.

12
00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:51.305
It doesn't make a difference in the actual
output because when it was a part time

13
00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:54.374
error it was as if accent color
was not specified at all.

14
00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:57.615
So we still got the full back.

15
00:00:57.615 --> 00:01:03.198
Now what if actual color
is set to just whitespace?

16
00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:06.749
What do we get then?

17
00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:10.227
We get transparent.

18
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.133
We actually get transparent in the same
way that we get transparent when we

19
00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.386
specify 42 degrees.

20
00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:21.236
Because whitespace is an invalid value for
background.

21
00:01:21.236 --> 00:01:24.306
What does background
white space mean nothing.

22
00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:26.851
So it becomes invalid
at computed value time.

23
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:33.910
And thus, we get the background's initial
value, but what happens in this case?

24
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.468
So here, if accent color is
said to the empty string,

25
00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:43.183
well, if it said to an empty value.

26
00:01:43.183 --> 00:01:45.780
Then we get the full back orange.

27
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.130
So we get a gradient from
white to transparent and

28
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.099
that is thrown over orange.

29
00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:59.786
Now what happens if accent color
is set to the to whitespace.

30
00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:04.411
If accent color is set to whitespace
then when it's substituted we

31
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.228
still get a valid value for background.

32
00:02:07.228 --> 00:02:12.062
We just get the linear gradient
from white to transparent.

33
00:02:12.062 --> 00:02:15.430
So we still get a value,
it's just a part of it has been turned off

34
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.152
Whitespace is a perfectly valid value for
custom property.

35
00:02:25.152 --> 00:02:29.184
If the second declaration is not invalid,
it looks invalid to many people,

36
00:02:29.184 --> 00:02:31.143
but it's actually perfectly fine.

37
00:02:31.143 --> 00:02:34.335
It's perfectly fine to have
whitespace as a value.

38
00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:39.022
It's whether the resulting value is
going to be valid after the custom

39
00:02:39.022 --> 00:02:42.609
property has been substituted
at the point of usage.

40
00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.555
That depends on what we have,
what value we have for

41
00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:49.401
our property after all these
whitespaces have been substituted.

42
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:53.172
So whitespace is perfectly valid and

43
00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:58.287
very useful in turning parts
of a value off and on.

44
00:02:58.287 --> 00:03:02.943
It can also be used as a fallback, and
it can also be useful as a fallback.

45
00:03:02.943 --> 00:03:07.633
So we want to add an inset
property as well to control

46
00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:10.916
whether the shadow is inset or not.

47
00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:14.436
So we would start by going
to the main role and

48
00:03:14.436 --> 00:03:18.349
resetting it to initial
to cancel inheritance.

49
00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:23.142
So it would be book shadow
inset in a show, and

50
00:03:23.142 --> 00:03:27.305
then we would go here to reference it but

51
00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:30.980
now all the shadows disappeared.

52
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.460
That's because it's not actually set.

53
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.404
While we could go here and do insert, or

54
00:03:38.404 --> 00:03:43.314
nothing even we could even
set it to whitespace.

55
00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:47.367
We don't wanna have to set it every
time we use these long hands of shorts.

56
00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:49.516
So what do we do?

57
00:03:49.516 --> 00:03:55.047
We just specify whitespace as
the fallback, and then it works just fine.

58
00:03:55.047 --> 00:04:00.333
It just turns this part of
the value off if we don't need it.

59
00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:05.059
So whitespace is perfectly useful as a
fallback as well not just as the value of

60
00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.014
the property.

61
00:04:06.014 --> 00:04:09.179
Now let's look at a slightly
more practical example.

62
00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:14.747
So here we have two variations of this
button, one that is completely flat,

63
00:04:14.747 --> 00:04:19.190
and one that has a subtle gradient
over it that we call shiny.

64
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.176
And right now we have to apply
a class to apply this gradient,

65
00:04:23.176 --> 00:04:25.137
which is not very practical.

66
00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:27.369
We don't wanna be adding and

67
00:04:27.369 --> 00:04:32.492
removing classes to our HTML just
to change the style of a button.

68
00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:35.758
It would be nice if we
could just summon this

69
00:04:35.758 --> 00:04:39.401
shininess straight from
the CSS wouldn't it.

70
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:44.041
What if we could do like
is shiny with some sort of

71
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:48.458
value here that turns the shyness off and
on.

72
00:04:48.458 --> 00:04:51.218
Well, we can actually do that.

73
00:04:51.218 --> 00:04:54.397
This gradient that we have here,

74
00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:59.974
it can just be the full back of
this value of this property.

75
00:04:59.974 --> 00:05:04.705
So we can do var is shiny
with the entire gradient As

76
00:05:04.705 --> 00:05:08.095
the fallback and now what happens.

77
00:05:08.095 --> 00:05:13.533
If it's shiny is initial,
we get the full back,

78
00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:18.850
if it's whitespace,
we just get whitespace.

79
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.980
And this means we can
even combine these right

80
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.515
here because we can just
turn the gradient off and

81
00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:33.172
on so whitespace no shininess.

82
00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:37.754
Initial, we get shininess.

83
00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.231
Let's try this from
an inline style as well.

84
00:05:40.231 --> 00:05:43.342
Because right now we're
still using this class.

85
00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:49.098
We can go here and specify initial for

86
00:05:49.098 --> 00:05:55.980
is shiny and
we would need to specify a base of

87
00:05:59.325 --> 00:06:02.730
Whitespace because we don't want it
to be active on the regular button.

88
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.435
And notice that now,
we can alternate between

89
00:06:06.435 --> 00:06:10.617
these values to turn the subtle
gradient on and off.

90
00:06:10.617 --> 00:06:13.532
However, the counterpoint to this is,

91
00:06:13.532 --> 00:06:17.145
this makes no sense to
anybody looking at my code.

92
00:06:17.145 --> 00:06:20.881
I don't wanna have to explain
this to any other developer.

93
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.360
This is awful.

94
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.546
Like having to specify
initial to turn things on,

95
00:06:26.546 --> 00:06:29.338
and whitespace to turn them off,

96
00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:34.040
good luck explaining that to
my colleagues and I agree.

97
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.257
Indeed this is very confusing.

98
00:06:36.257 --> 00:06:39.910
But there are ways to
make it easier to read.

99
00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:46.773
We can define aliases like ON and OFF.

100
00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:50.765
And ON can be initial since

101
00:06:50.765 --> 00:06:55.852
that's what turns the value on.

102
00:06:55.852 --> 00:07:01.803
So, here, we can come and
say, is shiny is off.

103
00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:06.781
So the base button has
shininess turned off.

104
00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:10.222
And then if we wanna turn it on,
we do this and

105
00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:13.670
nobody has to care how
this actually works.

106
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.420
They just use these on and off keywords.

107
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.791
And now despite this might be
a little more palatable and

108
00:07:22.791 --> 00:07:26.329
it's actually kind of
easy to read I find it.

109
00:07:26.329 --> 00:07:31.700
And obviously here it just turning
one part of one value on and

110
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.399
off but we could do an entire variations.

111
00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:39.358
Essentially this allows us to
emulate a lot of types of mixins.

112
00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:43.920
If you look at the notes,
I have a link to an article of mine

113
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.691
that has a more elaborate use case for
styling this button.

114
00:07:48.691 --> 00:07:53.022
So the takeaway here is that you can turn
off multiple different parts have custom

115
00:07:53.022 --> 00:07:56.790
properties in one go with whitespace and
this is called space toggle.
