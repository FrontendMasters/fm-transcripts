00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.717
So there's an exercise here,

2
00:00:03.717 --> 00:00:08.300
we have this repeated structure of items.

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.850
This is a supposed migraine log.

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.300
Migraine sufferers use applications
to track their migraines.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.068
And there's an intensity meter on each
of those items that allows people to set

6
00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:22.500
the intensity of their
migraines if they want.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.120
So the third item doesn't have
an intensity at all, the others do.

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.474
And this was output by some kind of
templating system, which also sets

9
00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:36.566
a custom property for the intensity so
that we can use it in our CSS.

10
00:00:36.566 --> 00:00:42.076
So what we want to do is we want to
change the main color of each migraine

11
00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:46.826
to be more red for
more intense migraines and more yellow for

12
00:00:46.826 --> 00:00:51.291
less intense migraines and
to be grey or actually blue,

13
00:00:51.291 --> 00:00:55.584
let's say blue,
something completely unrelated.

14
00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:59.290
For migraines I don't have an intensity
at all so that it's not confusing.
