00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.028
Alongside responsive design colors
are probably the most popular use

2
00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:04.059
of custom properties.

3
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.654
Let's look at an example here.

4
00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:16.060
So we have two accent colors.

5
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.100
One of them is this blue accent color and
one of them is red, but

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.614
it just happens to be red,
it could be anything else.

7
00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:27.023
And we've used them here both for

8
00:00:27.023 --> 00:00:31.906
the heading colors and
also for these buttons.

9
00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:35.816
And we've used them in
a variety of places.

10
00:00:35.816 --> 00:00:39.904
However, there is a problem
with using colors that way.

11
00:00:39.904 --> 00:00:44.113
And this problem becomes apparent
as designs evolve over time and

12
00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:47.261
CSS code changes by
multiple developers often.

13
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:51.990
So let's say we've designed this,
the website that

14
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:56.929
uses the these things and
later on we want to redesign and

15
00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.360
lovely custom properties
make it easy to do that.

16
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.235
We can just go here and change our second
accent color to use this kind of green.

17
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.305
Let's make it a little bit less saturated.

18
00:01:15.004 --> 00:01:19.845
Okay, and we quickly look at things and
we're like, this looks fine.

19
00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:25.039
However, the problem is that
we have used the second

20
00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.878
accent color variable as
just accent color two,

21
00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:34.850
when we actually wanted
to ascribe meaning to it.

22
00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.817
We had these cancel buttons and

23
00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:41.210
these delete button that didn't
just need the second accent color.

24
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.317
They actually needed red.

25
00:01:43.317 --> 00:01:47.571
And we had taken advantage of the fact
that our second accent color just happened

26
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:50.745
to be red, and we just said,
okay, we have this variable,

27
00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:52.796
we're just gonna use this variable.

28
00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:54.616
It looks fine, it's red.

29
00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:57.000
It conveys what we want to convey.

30
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.813
But the intent that we specified in
our code was not our actual intent.

31
00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:05.420
Our actual intent was to convey
that this action is dangerous.

32
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.150
This button will cancel what you're doing,
will delete what you're doing.

33
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.493
Colors have meanings,
they're not just decoration.

34
00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:18.858
So then when we change the second accent
color, this violated our intent and now it

35
00:02:18.858 --> 00:02:24.331
actually looks like you should be pressing
the cancel button because it's green.

36
00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:25.510
So what can we do?

37
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.101
There are many schools of thought here.

38
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:32.771
Some people name their colors after
after the main hue they say color red,

39
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:36.170
color green, color blue,
that would prevent this.

40
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.110
But also in other cases we do just want
whatever the first accent color is.

41
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.798
So what do we do then?.

42
00:02:43.798 --> 00:02:46.310
We don't actually have to choose.

43
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.076
We can just alias colors
to whatever we want.

44
00:02:51.076 --> 00:02:57.998
When we had red here, we could have also
said color red, var accent color two.

45
00:02:57.998 --> 00:03:05.491
And then when the redesign came along and
we wanted to change this to be green,

46
00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:09.989
whoever did the redesign
would look at this and

47
00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.160
say wait a second this
is not true anymore.

48
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.610
I need to specify a separate red for
whatever actually needs red.

49
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.970
And then we would have
still had a red there.

50
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.894
And obviously we would need
to actually use that here.

51
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.710
But we wouldn't be using
it in the heading.

52
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.756
Because the heading actually needs the
second accent color, we actually wanted to

53
00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:39.130
just use the second accent color,
whatever that was in the heading.

54
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.208
So one thing is that I think it
makes a lot of sense to use hue

55
00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:52.852
based aliases of accent
colors to make content clear.

56
00:03:52.852 --> 00:03:58.287
You don't need to decide whether
you're gonna use like primary and

57
00:03:58.287 --> 00:04:03.731
secondary and color one and color red,
you can just use all of them.

58
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:08.263
Now the main thing that most
people want from colors is

59
00:04:08.263 --> 00:04:10.890
creating variations of them.

60
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.802
Right now we can use custom
properties to specify entire colors,

61
00:04:15.802 --> 00:04:19.653
like primary color,
secondary color, and so on.

62
00:04:19.653 --> 00:04:25.160
But, what happens when we
want a darker primary color?

63
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.571
I mean,
surely we could do something like this and

64
00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:35.990
people do often specify these,
like primary color darker, whatever.

65
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.523
But then we need to change.

66
00:04:38.523 --> 00:04:42.303
We need to change these
colors in multiple places.

67
00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:46.763
Here we've applied a variety of
hacks that people often do to create

68
00:04:46.763 --> 00:04:48.964
variations of existing colors.

69
00:04:48.964 --> 00:04:54.189
We have a semi transparent white to
create a lighter primary color, and

70
00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.515
we've applied the brightness filter
to make a darker secondary color.

71
00:04:59.515 --> 00:05:03.740
How can we use custom properties to
actually create these variations without

72
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.520
these hacks?

73
00:05:08.593 --> 00:05:14.061
So we're first going to
see Tte most verbose but

74
00:05:14.061 --> 00:05:18.434
flexible way, so what we could do is,

75
00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:25.286
we could create variables for
each individual component.

76
00:05:25.286 --> 00:05:25.786
It's very, very verbose.

77
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.833
But it works.

78
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.030
And then here, we just use them.

79
00:05:47.768 --> 00:05:51.620
And we don't need fullbacks here because
they're all defined in the same rule.

80
00:05:54.913 --> 00:05:56.281
So we know they have a value.

81
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.784
There it is.

82
00:06:01.784 --> 00:06:06.780
And we could do the same thing
with the secondary color.

83
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.970
I know it's very tedious.

84
00:06:16.154 --> 00:06:19.974
40% here, and

85
00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:24.049
another 40% and

86
00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:30.930
then I'm just gonna copy this.

87
00:06:32.734 --> 00:06:38.720
And now we have all we know that we
actually need to create variations.

88
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.205
It's not gonna look pretty, but
it's it does make it possible.

89
00:06:43.205 --> 00:06:48.319
So here for
example in this link, instead of

90
00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:53.710
using this brightness hack,
we can go here and

91
00:06:53.710 --> 00:07:00.070
instead of specifying
the secondary color directly,

92
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.844
we can specify a variation of
it with a smaller lightness,

93
00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:12.672
something like this or
even something relative.

94
00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:18.604
Like we could multiply
the lightness by 0.6,

95
00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:25.124
which is closer to what we
were doing with the filter.

96
00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:27.590
And now let's go here.

97
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.202
We are specifying the semi
transparent white background.

98
00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:35.226
What we actually want is
a lighter primary color.

99
00:07:40.658 --> 00:07:46.357
This is primarily a proof of concept
because in this case I actually

100
00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:52.382
think the semi transparent white is
fine but let's do it a variation.

101
00:07:56.604 --> 00:08:02.876
And we could either multiply it by
a factor or we could add 50% for

102
00:08:02.876 --> 00:08:09.157
example, it depends on what kind
of variation you actually want.

103
00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:13.335
Some variations make more sense as
additions others as multiplications.

104
00:08:13.335 --> 00:08:17.731
You could even use clump to make sure
that the result is always readable.

105
00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:25.822
Like let's say you want the resulting
brightness to be between 80% and 95%.

106
00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:32.027
Whoops, this should be inside the clump.

107
00:08:32.027 --> 00:08:35.711
And now,
no matter what we do in the math here,

108
00:08:35.711 --> 00:08:41.675
we cannot actually go above 95% and
we cannot actually go below 80%.

109
00:08:41.675 --> 00:08:47.415
So we can not screw up the accessibility
of our website by doing incorrect

110
00:08:47.415 --> 00:08:52.979
math here or by having colors outside
the range of colors we expected.

111
00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.033
So, the first way we've seen to
do color variations is to specify

112
00:09:00.033 --> 00:09:04.890
each color component via separate
variables and just do math with it.

113
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.060
And that works.

114
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.329
It's very, very verbose.

115
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:14.183
It's painful to look at, but it works and
this is what a lot of code does today,

116
00:09:14.183 --> 00:09:18.830
and then as an aside we can use
clamp to to ensure readability.

117
00:09:22.664 --> 00:09:28.757
There is a second, there is a slight
improvement that we could make over this.

118
00:09:28.757 --> 00:09:32.021
So usually when we want to
create these variations,

119
00:09:32.021 --> 00:09:35.951
we just want to change the lightness and
sometimes the alpha but

120
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:40.770
we don't usually want to change the hue
and the saturation because the hue and

121
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.580
the saturation is what basically
makes our color what it is.

122
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.330
It's the essence of our color.

123
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:51.025
So what we can do is we can store
these in the same variable.

124
00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:53.740
We can have HHS instead of H and S.

125
00:09:59.754 --> 00:10:07.333
And then at least that reduces the number
of variables we need to use for

126
00:10:07.333 --> 00:10:12.096
each color by a third, which is something.

127
00:10:12.096 --> 00:10:18.770
Let's see and I need to change
them here as well and here too.

128
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.554
Yes and that works fine.

129
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.401
So the second takeaway around colors
is that we can store multiple

130
00:10:28.401 --> 00:10:30.977
color components in the same variable.

131
00:10:35.378 --> 00:10:38.678
Now what happens if we want to create
further variations within the same

132
00:10:38.678 --> 00:10:39.290
component?

133
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:42.123
Let's say we want to make the links.

134
00:10:42.123 --> 00:10:44.521
The links later on hover.

135
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:46.514
Let's try to do that.

136
00:10:46.514 --> 00:10:53.363
So if we add a hover rule here and
we want to apply a different lightness,

137
00:10:53.363 --> 00:10:59.885
we would have actually need to copy
this entire unwieldy thing and.

138
00:11:03.316 --> 00:11:04.752
Change the lightness.

139
00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:07.502
It works but it's not great.

140
00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:10.250
So what can we do?

141
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:18.025
We can use a variation of this
technique within this CSS rule.

142
00:11:18.025 --> 00:11:21.956
So you know how we have separate
likenesses and hues and

143
00:11:21.956 --> 00:11:24.181
saturations in the main rule.

144
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:27.882
We can do text color L and
you can also do hue and

145
00:11:27.882 --> 00:11:33.836
saturation if you need it but here we
just knew we just need L and use that.

146
00:11:37.476 --> 00:11:40.884
And that also makes our code
slightly easier to read I find.

147
00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:52.230
So all right we need we calc as well,
okay?

148
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:58.799
And- There we are.

149
00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:04.324
And then here, instead of having
to repeat the entire color,

150
00:12:04.324 --> 00:12:08.694
all we need to do is
override just the lightness.

151
00:12:12.043 --> 00:12:13.521
And it works.

152
00:12:13.521 --> 00:12:21.395
So another strategy is using
background color star, text color star.

153
00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:26.430
It could be even like box shadow,
whatever lightness, whatever you need for

154
00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.854
independent tweaking of color
components for specific elements.
