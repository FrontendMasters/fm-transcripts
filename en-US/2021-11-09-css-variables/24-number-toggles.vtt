00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.174
So we spoke earlier
about spaced toggles and

2
00:00:03.174 --> 00:00:07.989
how we can use these two obscure
values to swap between two values.

3
00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:13.455
However, there is-,
when we want to toggle between

4
00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:18.074
numerical values there
is a much easier way.

5
00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:19.222
Let's look at this example.

6
00:00:19.222 --> 00:00:22.170
It's slightly similar to
what we've seen previously.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.938
We have two blog posts.

8
00:00:23.938 --> 00:00:27.887
One of them has a class of dark and
the other one doesn't.

9
00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:33.970
And the one that has the class of dark
has some different CSS applied to it.

10
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.733
So that it could look more appropriate for
dark mode.

11
00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:42.539
Like here and here.

12
00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.259
However, this requires applying a class,
this requires changing the HTML.

13
00:00:47.259 --> 00:00:52.166
We want to be able to just change
a custom property to be able to

14
00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:57.000
toggle between dark mode or
light mode for that component.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.755
And that way we can decide in our
CSS when to enable dark mode for

16
00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:04.048
each individual component.

17
00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:08.979
We could set it with a media query
we could set it with a class we

18
00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.701
could set it but however we want.

19
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:16.030
So how could we do that?

20
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.445
Let's look at the values we have here, so

21
00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:24.630
this is white which we could
write ours HSL 0, 0, 100%.

22
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.222
And here we have black
which we can set as 0, 0,

23
00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:33.032
0% because black has zero lightness.

24
00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:37.715
And for now I'm gonna go here and

25
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:43.970
set is dark to 0 here and
is dark to 1 here.

26
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.423
So we can see what we're doing.

27
00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:48.920
So how could we use
the is dark variable so

28
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.499
that we combine these two rules into one.

29
00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:58.497
If we have a calc function here
to perform from a calculation.

30
00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:03.425
We want to get 100% when
is dark is zero and

31
00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:07.585
we want to get zero when is dark is one.

32
00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.969
So how are we gonna do that?

33
00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:15.091
So the general formula is,
we have our variable and

34
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:19.986
we multiply it by the value
we want when it's 1.

35
00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:24.239
The value we want when it's one is 100%.

36
00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.859
And then we add 1 minus that variable.

37
00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.753
Multiplied by the value
we want when it's 0.

38
00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:41.220
So now when is dark is 0, what do we get?

39
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.218
We get 0% here,
because this entire term disappears.

40
00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:52.300
And this is 1 minus 0 multiplied by 0,
so it needs to be the other way around.

41
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.124
Actually, I think, We

42
00:02:57.124 --> 00:03:01.270
need to 0 here and a 100% here, yes.

43
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.228
And now it's fine.

44
00:03:04.228 --> 00:03:08.464
However, this is a little bit difficult
to remember as you've just seen.

45
00:03:08.464 --> 00:03:13.113
So what we can do is defined and
is not dark.

46
00:03:16.381 --> 00:03:23.543
Property, Which is always the opposite

47
00:03:23.543 --> 00:03:29.157
when is dark is zero it gives us one and
when is dark is one it gives us zero.

48
00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:32.674
This is essentially Boolean logic and
coded into CSS.

49
00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:36.843
So here instead of having to
remember when to use one minus and

50
00:03:36.843 --> 00:03:39.471
when to use just the property itself.

51
00:03:39.471 --> 00:03:42.678
We just go here and
use is dark and is not dark.

52
00:03:42.678 --> 00:03:48.049
So basically we use is dark multiplied
by the value we want if is dark is 1 and

53
00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.909
then is not dark multiplied by
the value we want if it's dark is 0 and

54
00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.753
we use 0 and 1 to toggle between them.

55
00:03:55.753 --> 00:03:58.921
And similarly,
we can do the same thing here.

56
00:04:02.703 --> 00:04:08.525
So here we want the content to be black
in regular blog posts the color to be

57
00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:14.641
black in a regular blog post and the color
to be white in a dark mode blog post.

58
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.806
So we could basically do the same
thing here, and just flip these two.

59
00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.365
Now, we can remove that.

60
00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:35.395
And similarly, We can go here,

61
00:04:35.395 --> 00:04:42.754
so we want 0.8 in regular mode and
0.2 in dark mode.

62
00:04:42.754 --> 00:04:50.374
So, Let's go here,

63
00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:55.711
we want 0.2 in dark mode,
0.8 in regular mode.

64
00:04:57.907 --> 00:05:00.903
And we can remove this as well.

65
00:05:00.903 --> 00:05:02.812
And now, what does this give us?

66
00:05:02.812 --> 00:05:07.034
Right now, we have exactly the same result
pretty much with more complicated code.

67
00:05:07.034 --> 00:05:11.933
But what we have achieved is,
we can toggle this

68
00:05:11.933 --> 00:05:16.473
is dark property however
we want in our CSS.

69
00:05:16.473 --> 00:05:21.885
We could go here and
say prefers color scheme dark and

70
00:05:21.885 --> 00:05:25.455
make all of them dark on dark mode.

71
00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:32.110
Or we could go here and say if we have
a class in the HTML that is dark,

72
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.309
then we make everything dark.

73
00:05:39.575 --> 00:05:44.679
And we could also have the dark
class that we already had.

74
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:50.595
It gives us a lot more flexibility.

75
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:58.960
So to sum up, you can use 0/1 toggles for
any numeric value.

76
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.317
And the basic formula looks like this.

77
00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:05.332
If you're interested in this,
there is a lot more.

78
00:06:05.332 --> 00:06:07.580
You can go a lot deeper with this.

79
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.466
There is a tire on a tutor has
come up with entire formulas for

80
00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:13.351
like all logic operations.

81
00:06:13.351 --> 00:06:15.946
You can find a lot of
pointers in the notes here.

82
00:06:15.946 --> 00:06:18.330
There's a lot of literature on this stuff.
