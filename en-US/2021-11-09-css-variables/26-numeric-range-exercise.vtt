00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.541
Here we have a heading
with large shadow and

2
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:11.980
the background that is a spotlight.

3
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.998
And what we want to do is right now,
the spotlight is at the top left corner.

4
00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:25.910
And notice how we can increase this
number, the center of radial gradient,

5
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.240
to make it move to the top
right corner from 0 to 100%.

6
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.504
And we also want the offset

7
00:00:36.504 --> 00:00:41.050
of the shadow to change

8
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.852
accordingly to -1M.

9
00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:49.841
So let's take a few
minutes to practice making

10
00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:54.410
this a variable that controls
both of these at once.

11
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.984
And then we could even write
an animation around our variable.
