00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.650
Hello and welcome to this course.

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.700
I was delighted to be given
the opportunity to create this course for

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.030
frontend masters.

4
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.343
Because I always felt that
custom properties have so

5
00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:10.560
much untapped potential.

6
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.310
So before we start, who's Lea?

7
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.010
So hi, I'm Lea Verou.

8
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.250
My Twitter handle is right there.

9
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.100
Feel free to ping me with any questions.

10
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.700
I'm a CSS Working Group invited expert for
about a decade.

11
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.900
I co-edit several CSS specifications and
have provided input for a lot more.

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.726
So I have been actually involved in
a lot of the things we're going to

13
00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:34.430
discuss today.

14
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.390
Awesome this year,
I'm also an elected W3C TAG member.

15
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.547
The W3C TAG is a special
working group within W3C,

16
00:00:42.547 --> 00:00:46.940
which reviews all other proposals to
add new, APIs to the web platform.

17
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.304
My day job is a human-computer interaction
researcher at MIT human-computer

18
00:00:52.304 --> 00:00:55.810
interaction just the fancy
academic term for usability.

19
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.196
My research is centered around
usability in programming languages.

20
00:01:01.196 --> 00:01:03.982
And I've started a bunch
of open source projects and

21
00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:07.020
have reviewed 1000s of pull
requests at this point so

22
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.960
that also colors my perspective about
what kind of code is maintainable.

23
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.750
So what will you need for this course?

24
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.870
A solid understanding of modern CSS is
definitely an important prerequisite.

25
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.830
I'm not going to explain
things like grid and Flexbox.

26
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.520
I kind of expect you to be familiar.

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.378
And I expect you to have significant
experience solving problems with CSS so

28
00:01:30.378 --> 00:01:32.250
that you can recognize them.

29
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.306
When I describe these problems and
better solutions to them, a little bit of

30
00:01:37.306 --> 00:01:42.770
Sass would be useful because we're going
to use it in a few parts of the workshop.

31
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.784
But if you don't have any experience
with Sass or any other pre processors,

32
00:01:45.784 --> 00:01:48.110
don't worry about it it's a tiny part.

33
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.725
And for the last section, you will need
a little bit of experience writing

34
00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:56.383
vanilla JS without any frameworks
mainly events and Dom.

35
00:01:56.383 --> 00:01:58.508
But I'm going to go through them so

36
00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:03.140
don't worry if you don't have all
that much experience with JavaScript.

37
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.623
So what are we going to learn.

38
00:02:07.623 --> 00:02:11.647
We are going to learn how to use
custom properties to make our CSS more

39
00:02:11.647 --> 00:02:15.210
maintainable, more extensible,
more robust.

40
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.290
We are going to learn how to create
styling hooks so that other people can

41
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.070
style our components and allow us to still
change everything about them internally.

42
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.178
We will learn how to use custom
properties to create transitions and

43
00:02:29.178 --> 00:02:32.566
animations that were not
visible without JavaScript or

44
00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:35.968
even those that were visible,
but in a much easier way.

45
00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:39.598
And lastly but perhaps most importantly,
how to finally,

46
00:02:39.598 --> 00:02:45.240
cleanly separate style and behavior in
a way that was never possible before.

47
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.929
And along the way,
we're gonna mention a lot of caveats,

48
00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:52.780
gotchas workarounds because
this is a CSS course after all.

49
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.520
So when will you need?

50
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.748
All you will need to follow along
in Is basically a recent Chrome and

51
00:03:00.748 --> 00:03:02.870
the functioning keyboard.

52
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.620
That's about it.

53
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.050
You should open the slide deck.

54
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.307
The link is right there and

55
00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:13.445
you just press the arrow key
to advance through the slides.
