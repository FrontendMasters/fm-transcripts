00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.599
The landscape of color manipulation
today in CSS, it's not ideal.

2
00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:09.035
We could use separate properties for
hue saturation and lightness.

3
00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:13.792
Maybe hue and saturation can be stored
together to save some repetition,

4
00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:14.950
some verbosity.

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.920
We can have pre computed variations, at
least that ensures consistency throughout

6
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.378
our design, but it's more repetitive.

7
00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:27.721
And we could also have like separate
background color, whatever, text color,

8
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:32.290
whatever properties to create
variations within a part of the HTML.

9
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.600
None of this is ideal, but
this is what we have right now.

10
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.953
And of course, they can all coexist, they
can all be used together as we've seen.

11
00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.440
However, things are going to get better.

12
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.950
The future is colorful.

13
00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.390
In the future, we'll be able to have
functions that manipulate color.

14
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.338
These are already specified
in CSS color level five, and

15
00:01:03.338 --> 00:01:05.560
they are actually implemented in Safari.

16
00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.860
There is a color mixed function,
and actually Firefox also

17
00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.610
implements this color mix function just
in a limited way, in a more limited way.

18
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.405
Where you can specify
a mixing color space and

19
00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:21.670
percentages of the colors
that you're mixing.

20
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.777
So you can create tints,
you can like combine a color with white or

21
00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:28.460
combine a color with black,
and create tints and shades.

22
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.140
There is a relative syntax.

23
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.061
Actually I proposed this a few years ago,
so

24
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:35.560
I'm very happy that it's finally
starting to get implemented.

25
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.819
There is a relative syntax that
lets you specify a base color and

26
00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.459
then do math with all its components.

27
00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:51.788
And we'll also get better color spaces for
adjustment as well like I can't wait for

28
00:01:51.788 --> 00:01:53.480
LCH to be available everywhere.
