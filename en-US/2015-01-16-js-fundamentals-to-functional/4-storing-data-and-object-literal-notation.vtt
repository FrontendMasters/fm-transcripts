00:00:00.097 --> 00:00:03.876
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.876 --> 00:00:08.500
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: One last thing I want
to talk about objects is storing data.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.580
So as I mentioned briefly before,
we can store anything in our objects.

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.870
So here we have on, I guess, the second
line here, we're storing a string.

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.200
But we can also store an object.

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.550
And then we can also store functions.

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.600
When we store functions as a property and
an object we call it a method.

8
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.900
I'm not sure why we have to do that,
but that's what we do.

9
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.230
And yeah.

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.700
Any questions about that?

11
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.340
Sure?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you say that again?

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.840
Elaborate.

13
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.730
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: On?
Elaborate.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.090
So this slide is just showing that we can
store all kinds of any data in JavaScript.

15
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.260
So any data type.

16
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.000
So we have strings, we can store numbers,

17
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.810
you can store booleans,
you can store undefined, null.

18
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.210
You can also store functions and objects.

19
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.140
And when we store our function
as a property in an object,

20
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.250
we call that a method.

21
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.640
So if you hear the term
method thrown around and

22
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.790
function thrown around, just know that
they're the same thing pretty much,

23
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.280
except that a method is just a property
on an object that's a function.

24
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.999
That's the only difference.

25
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.360
But if you really think
about it in the browser,

26
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.290
everything's attached to
the window object, so

27
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.390
you could kind of say that everything's a
method, but maybe I'm taking that too far.

28
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So area here is the method?

29
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.738
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah
area is the method.

30
00:01:34.738 --> 00:01:35.779
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Got it.

31
00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:36.760
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

32
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.486
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
in the function part of your lecture,

33
00:01:41.486 --> 00:01:43.720
are you gonna get into the whole.

34
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.680
When is the difference between a function
and the method and all that stuff or?

35
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.770
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I mean yeah,
I'll talk about it,

36
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.100
I mean the difference between a function
and method is there's no difference.

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

38
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.910
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
Like as far as how you use them,

39
00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.930
the only thing it's just
a vocab word really

40
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.440
that a method is a function
that's a property of an object.

41
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.690
So if you say like an array has a method.

42
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.520
That just means that the array has
a function like array.push, right.

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.965
And we put the two parentheses on
the side, that means that is a function.

44
00:02:17.965 --> 00:02:19.974
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

45
00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:27.280
That's all, cool and then just, just
like some styles a lot of people say so

46
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.550
you can do bracket you can do dots,
when would you use one versus the other?

47
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.020
And it really really doesn't matter again,
at your job or if you're contributing to

48
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.230
open source, if they have a style guide
of course follow their guidelines.

49
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.286
For me, I always use dot notation unless
it's a variable or an odd character,

50
00:02:44.286 --> 00:02:48.651
just simply because it's shorter
to type and it's just easier, so

51
00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:53.627
in general, I just use dots unless I
need to do something with an expression,

52
00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:56.866
like evaluate a variable or
something like that.

53
00:02:59.326 --> 00:03:00.146
Cool.

54
00:03:04.287 --> 00:03:04.810
All right.

55
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.590
So, just going back up to a slide.

56
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.170
So we have like two different ways
to look at the object, right.

57
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.220
We have this sort of a notation to the,
I don't know if that's left or

58
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.980
right, to the side.

59
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.840
And then we have this notation where
we're dynamically adding properties.

60
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.820
So this one right here is
called object literal notation,

61
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.680
and I'm gonna talk about how to
translate one from the other.

62
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.600
So first, again,
we're gonna start with how we had it.

63
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.300
We have this object literal that's empty.

64
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.470
And then we expand out that bracket.

65
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.300
And so now that we have
everything inside of our object,

66
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.480
we can lose the reference to box,
right cuz it's inside,

67
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.110
so we take off box,
we don't need the brackets either.

68
00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.200
And then, we aren't assigning
anything we're just setting it.

69
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.000
So we just, we have some colons,
and then we added a comma,

70
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.540
and then we're gonna take out that
semi-colon and keep it at the end.

71
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.630
And so that's sort of
the walk-through on how to go from

72
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.770
dynamically adding properties and values
to an object, to object-literal notation.

73
00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:19.780
Which you've probably
seen both of them by now.

74
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.140
And the important thing here
is that property names,

75
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.050
in this case, are always gonna be strings.

76
00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.800
They're not gonna be expressions.

77
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.857
But you can put in
an expression as the value.

78
00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:37.917
Cool.

79
00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:42.677
Any questions about that?

80
00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:43.857
Sort of the different syntax.

81
00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:50.550
And also in this case,
we don't even need to have quotations.

82
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.130
Since it's going to be assumed that
size is a string, we don't need quotes.

83
00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.360
However, if you're going to have something
with funny characters, like this, you're

84
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.270
going to need to keep those quotes around
there, cuz it'll confuse your interpreter.

85
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.930
Cool, and then we can still use our
dot bracket notation still the same,

86
00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.000
even if we're using
object literal notations.

87
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.227
It's just a different way to writing it.

88
00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:17.087
Cool, any questions?

89
00:05:17.087 --> 00:05:19.975
I'm gonna wait for
just like one question, so

90
00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:23.470
if someone could just ask me a question,
we can move on.

91
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do, when teams are working,
they come to agreement on which

92
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.330
way to do things based on a style guide,
or how do you do that?

93
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, I mean,
there might be a style guide,

94
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.630
I don't know if it'll be as in-depth.

95
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.860
But as far as like when you should
use object rotation versus adding

96
00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:49.350
properties dynamically, it kind of depends
on your data and how you're getting it.

97
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.880
So if your data's gonna change,
for example,

98
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.648
like after run time, it might make
sense to store in a variable.

99
00:05:56.648 --> 00:06:00.910
And add it dynamically, especially if
the property names could be different.

100
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.765
So if it's gonna change after run time,
it would be you would probably wanna use

101
00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:10.216
the bracket or dot notation, but
if it's something that's static and

102
00:06:10.216 --> 00:06:13.379
it's just an object that you have and
that data doesn't change,

103
00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.687
then you can just put in object
literal notation and call it a day.,
