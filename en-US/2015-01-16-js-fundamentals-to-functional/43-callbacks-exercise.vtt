&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
I have just a short exercise for this.

3
00:00:09.074 --> 00:00:15.850
I'm gonna go back to the functionalJS
repo and it's in the callback section.

4
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.549
So we have this callback.

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.150
Only a few, but we also have one last
thing for the module pattern in closures,

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.160
that number seven, the toaster one.

7
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.460
You want to design your toaster.

8
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.159
You can get started with that.

9
00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:38.142
So what we're doing is in the closures
we're doing number seven which

10
00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:39.328
is the toaster.

11
00:00:39.328 --> 00:00:44.371
And then for
call backs we're going to do all of them,

12
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:49.640
one through three, and
then there's also extra credit

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.379
if you finish early that combines
call backs with closures.

14
00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.270
It's pretty interesting.
