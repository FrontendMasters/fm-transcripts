2
00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:06.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
now it's exercise time.

3
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.818
So if we just go back where we were,

4
00:00:09.818 --> 00:00:14.180
sort of like our table of contents.

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.200
You can just go to the functions exercise
and get started and it's the same.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.080
It's all in the scripts.js file or
in your JS Bin.

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.280
And you're gonna go through and
put some functionality in there.

8
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:36.740
So and we'll have about, 30,
let's see what time is it, 2?

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.839
Yeah, we'll have about 40 minutes for
these is a little bit longer.

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.170
So, let's go with 40 minutes.

11
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.999
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's a question
in the chat room here.

12
00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:55.943
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

13
00:00:55.943 --> 00:01:01.310
Pete asked, how does AnimalMaker
know when it is passed an array?

14
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.940
It is pass and array and

15
00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.290
has to iterate through it versus
just grabbing the first value.

16
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.370
So we're actually explicitly,
where are my slides?

17
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.080
We're actually explicitly
looping through it.

18
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.170
So AnimalMaker, the function
itself knows nothing of the array.

19
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.990
What we're actually doing
is we're just looping.

20
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.556
And here actually, this slide up
here makes it a little more clear.

21
00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:34.950
So this four loop is actually what's doing
the looping part, and inside of the four

22
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.240
loop, we're actually passing
the animal name, we can see it here.

23
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.870
This is where we're calling AnimalMaker,

24
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.170
and we're not calling AnimalMaker
with the entire array.

25
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.690
We're actually calling it
with one value in the array.

26
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.720
So, animalNames[i], so the first one,
the zero in index would be sheep.

27
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.984
So it's saying, AnimalMakers, and

28
00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:58.884
then you could replace that right
here with sheep, for example.

29
00:02:02.494 --> 00:02:07.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE].

30
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:08.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
that's how it knows.

31
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.420
Does that answer your questions?

32
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.230
Cool.
