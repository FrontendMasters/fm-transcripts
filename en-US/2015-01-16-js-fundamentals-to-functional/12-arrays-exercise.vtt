00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:07.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: So, actually,
I'm gonna do nesting in a minute.

3
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.300
And it's gonna be Exercise Time.

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.690
So again,
we're gonna jump right into the exercises.

5
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.640
We're gonna go to Arrays.

6
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.290
And this is a little bit,
a little bit longer.

7
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.210
So maybe 30 minutes, let's say 40 minutes,

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.670
let's do 40 minutes for this one and we're
going to create our second data structure,

9
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.560
which is going to be a collection.

10
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.010
Which is going to be an array
of our animal objects and

11
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.120
that's how we're gonna to be representing
our data for our application for eFarmony.
