2
00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:10.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So then let's talk
about the difference between each and map.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.860
So the important thing to know is
that each like I mentioned before,

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.100
you can't return anything from each.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.210
So, each will be something
better suited for

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.170
getting each animal to
speak versus if you wanted

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.990
to have it return something like
especially if you want to return an array.

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.810
Map is a better bet,
however if you don't wanted to

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.830
explicitly return an array maybe
you want to return an object.

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.587
You might wanna wrap each into a function
where it pushes to an object instead.

11
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:49.980
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So then we can run all
of our code, or let's get some more names.

12
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.880
Let's see, Kim, John.

13
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So if I wanted to map that
into a, if I wanted to use each to map it

14
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.340
into an object,
I still have to make the function.

15
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.445
But I don't have to iterate
because each does that for me and

16
00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:12.340
just push it on to that object.

17
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.950
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, exactly,
however you wanna implement it.

18
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.320
But, map is always gonna return an array.

19
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm

20
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The prior example had

21
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.520
an explicit return on animal maker,
why the inference?

22
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.550
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's do
they mean by an explicit return?

23
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: When you use map,

24
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.770
you have to have return, but
when you use each you don't use return.

25
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
When you use each, you can't use return,

26
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.140
each doesn't return anything.

27
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.550
But map, you have to use return.

28
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.220
Whatever is returned from
that callback function

29
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.230
is then going to be put into the array.

30
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.180
So it's really important that whenever
you're using map that you're actually

31
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.010
returning something.

32
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.630
Otherwise your gonna get
an array of undefined.

33
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.950
So if I didn't return here, we'd get and

34
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.950
we still mapped over it, we'd get
an array of three undefined values.

35
00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:12.360
So we need to make sure that we
return in that call back function.

36
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.640
Where as the animal, and this is for
the animal.speak is fine,

37
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.630
because we're not returning anything
there, we're just console that logging.

38
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're
a little bit behind us, but

39
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.260
the prior map example
didn't have a return.

40
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or
maybe did I miss the return?

41
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: When we did that one,
I think what they're saying is

42
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.100
when you did the map with var
farm there's no return there.

43
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Maybe that's what they're
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like this?

44
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.640
There needs to be a return.

45
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.680
So if there wasn't a return,
I made a mistake here, AnimalMaker(name).

46
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.180
So you have to return here.

47
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.398
Cuz what this is saying is, so AnimalMaker
return something and then you're

48
00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:08.630
returning whatever AnimalMaker returns,
so that's why there's two returns here.

49
00:03:13.713 --> 00:03:15.170
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
I hope that answers your question.

50
00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, cool.

51
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.707
We're right on time again, awesome.

52
00:03:34.707 --> 00:03:36.090
So.

53
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.890
Just a quick recap each,
we can't return anything.

54
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.790
Now we have to return something and
it returns into an array.

55
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.300
Do you have any question Mark?

56
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, they're the same that
by just putting animal maker there that

57
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.880
explicitly has a return?

58
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It explicitly
has a return inside AnimalMaker.

59
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right, but on that map,
I think that the last example,

60
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.630
the short version just had AnimalMaker.

61
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.758
So that implicitly does the return, right?

62
00:04:08.758 --> 00:04:09.552
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.

63
00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:12.338
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

64
00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:18.973
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But it's important
that you actually explicitly return

65
00:04:18.973 --> 00:04:21.650
something inside an animal maker.

66
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:22.400
That's the difference.

67
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Animal maker is already
returning something you didn't need

68
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.040
that intermediate autonomous
function to return

69
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.070
the value of calling animal feeder
because it's already did that.

70
00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.570
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, exactly.
