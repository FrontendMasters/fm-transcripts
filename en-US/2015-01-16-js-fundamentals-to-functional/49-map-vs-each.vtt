[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:10.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So then let's talk
about the difference between each and map.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.860
So the important thing to know is
that each like I mentioned before,

4
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.100
you can't return anything from each.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.210
So, each will be something
better suited for

6
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.170
getting each animal to
speak versus if you wanted

7
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.990
to have it return something like
especially if you want to return an array.

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.810
Map is a better bet,
however if you don't wanted to

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.830
explicitly return an array maybe
you want to return an object.

10
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.795
You might wanna wrap each into
a function where it pushes to an object

11
00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:46.151
instead.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

12
00:00:46.151 --> 00:00:49.980
then we can run all of our code,
or let's get some more names.

13
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.100
Let's see, Kim, John.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

14
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.350
if I wanted to map that into a,
if I wanted to use each to map it

15
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.340
into an object,
I still have to make the function.

16
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.445
But I don't have to iterate
because each does that for me and

17
00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:13.350
just push it on to that object.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, exactly,

18
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.950
however you wanna implement it.

19
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.885
But, map is always gonna return an array.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

20
00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:20.440
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm

21
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The prior example had

22
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.690
an explicit return on animal maker,

23
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.680
why the inference?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's do

24
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.450
they mean by an explicit return?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: When you use map,

25
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.050
you have to have return, but

26
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.130
when you use each you don't use return.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

27
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.140
When you use each, you can't use return,
each doesn't return anything.

28
00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.550
But map, you have to use return.

29
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.220
Whatever is returned from
that callback function

30
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.230
is then going to be put into the array.

31
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.180
So it's really important that whenever
you're using map that you're actually

32
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.010
returning something.

33
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.630
Otherwise your gonna get
an array of undefined.

34
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.950
So if I didn't return here, we'd get and

35
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.950
we still mapped over it, we'd get
an array of three undefined values.

36
00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:12.360
So we need to make sure that we
return in that call back function.

37
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.640
Where as the animal, and this is for
the animal.speak is fine,

38
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.180
because we're not
returning anything there,

39
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.410
we're just console that logging.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're a little

40
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.930
bit behind us, but
the prior map example didn't have

41
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.950
a return.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or

42
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.380
maybe did I miss the return?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: When

43
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.270
we did that one, I think what they're
saying is when you did the map

44
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.880
with var farm there's no return there.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Maybe that's what they're

45
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like this?

46
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.640
There needs to be a return.

47
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.680
So if there wasn't a return,
I made a mistake here, AnimalMaker(name).

48
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.180
So you have to return here.

49
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.611
Cuz what this is saying is, so
AnimalMaker return something and

50
00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:07.689
then you're returning whatever AnimalMaker
returns, so that's why there's two

51
00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.804
returns here.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

52
00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:15.170
I hope that answers your question.

53
00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:32.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, cool.

54
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.707
We're right on time again, awesome.

55
00:03:34.707 --> 00:03:36.090
So.

56
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.890
Just a quick recap each,
we can't return anything.

57
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.790
Now we have to return something and
it returns into an array.

58
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.190
Do you have any question Mark?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, they're the same that

59
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.880
by just putting animal maker there
that explicitly has a return?

60
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.400
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It explicitly has

61
00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.030
a return inside AnimalMaker.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right, but on that map,

62
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.630
I think that the last example,
the short version just had AnimalMaker.

63
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.552
So that implicitly does the return, right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.

64
00:04:09.552 --> 00:04:12.338
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

65
00:04:15.337 --> 00:04:16.625
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But it's important

66
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:21.650
that you actually explicitly return
something inside an animal maker.

67
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.940
That's the difference.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Animal maker is already

68
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.040
returning something you didn't need that
intermediate autonomous function to return

69
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.610
the value of calling animal
feeder because it's already did

70
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.450
that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, exactly.
