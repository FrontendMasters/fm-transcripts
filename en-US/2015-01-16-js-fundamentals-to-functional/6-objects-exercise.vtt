[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.115 --> 00:00:06.096
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
now it's exercise time.

3
00:00:06.096 --> 00:00:09.100
Normally, at how we handle
exercises is we would

4
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.470
go to the pairing machines and do that.

5
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.390
But since we can't do that,
we're going to have to mix it up.

6
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.630
If you're here together,
I recommend pairing.

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.880
I think it's really helpful and
it makes things fun.

8
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.310
You learn how to communicate your code,
and actually,

9
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.810
you can clarify in your mind your
understanding to take these intuitive

10
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.120
understandings of how JavaScript works and
apply these rules to them.

11
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.210
And really make that solid,
so if you can, pair up.

12
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.247
And I'm just gonna walk you through
a little bit how to get started with

13
00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:45.214
the exercises.

14
00:00:45.214 --> 00:00:49.644
Again, if you just type in the bit.ly, so

15
00:00:49.644 --> 00:00:54.824
the bit.ly is bit.ly/js102-exercises.

16
00:00:54.824 --> 00:00:58.063
And you can also find that
on the first slide and

17
00:00:58.063 --> 00:01:00.650
I think Mark sent out an email prior.

18
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.240
And so that will bring you to this,
this get hub repo.

19
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.840
And what you can do then is you can
download, hit this button here,

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.620
download zip, oops, so
you download the zip here.

21
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.870
Let's see.

22
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:21.890
I'll just save it for now.

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.290
And so what we're gonna be doing
today is we're gonna be doing this

24
00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.090
eFarmony Project.

25
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.145
So eFarmony is this hot new dating app for
animals.

26
00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:36.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Looking for funding,

27
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.890
so if there's any VC's out there,
it's a great idea, and

28
00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.692
I have hundreds of engineers across
the world working on it right now.

29
00:01:44.692 --> 00:01:52.800
Jokes aside, we're going to clone down
the repo and we're going to start here.

30
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.940
In the before you get started section,

31
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.160
it's gonna tell you how to navigate
the files and where to go.

32
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.690
We just downloaded the zip, and
now we're gonna explore the file.

33
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.859
So if we show this in our finder,
we had to unzip it, of course.

34
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.460
And then we're gonna go in here.

35
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.510
And so

36
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.236
the first thing we can do is we're
gonna open our index.html file.

37
00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:27.310
And we'll notice that this page
is intentionally left blank.

38
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.850
And basically what this is for,
this html page is for, is just to be able

39
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.940
to play in your console with the code
that you write and your script.js file.

40
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.600
So if we go here to our script.js file and

41
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.870
were gonna open it with our text editor,
whatever you choose.

42
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.450
And we'll see, and comments here, were
gonna use this file, its actually not just

43
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.040
part one, it's gonna be, we're just
gonna do all of our code in this file.

44
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.830
And so if we just console.log,
animal here.

45
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.790
You're gonna be typing animal a lot,
and farm a lot today.

46
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.020
And we refresh here,
we see we have a console.log animal.

47
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.940
So that's one way, that's one work flow.

48
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.080
Again, you type in the text editor.

49
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.780
You save it.

50
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.510
Saving is important.

51
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.710
And then you refresh the page, and

52
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.450
that's when you can access
the changes in your code.

53
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.530
For example,
we can say var myAnimal = {} and

54
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.490
we can give it some properties.

55
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.459
Maybe it's a sheep so it says baaahhhh.

56
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.660
Again, I've saved it so for me Cmd+S is
save and then I refresh the page, Cmd+R.

57
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.350
And then I can type in myAnimal.

58
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.140
So notice myAnimal I can then
access in my developer tools.

59
00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.030
So I'm using Chrome, you can also use
Firefox, if that's what you prefer.

60
00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.490
And to open your developer tools,
you go to View, Developer,

61
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.830
and then JavaScript Console.

62
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.680
And if you get lost in it,
you can always on this first,

63
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.790
there's a bunch of tabs and
it's easy to get lost in the tabs.

64
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.400
You can always just click here and
click back to console.

65
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.010
And so that's the workflow of how
you're going to be doing this project.

66
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.110
If you're online you could try jsbin.

67
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.470
It might be more helpful if you wanna
share your code in the chatroom.

68
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.690
So if you put it in jsbin you would just
need to put your JavaScript here and

69
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.310
then you have your console.

70
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.170
So if you open your JS Bin, this way.

71
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.540
So where you have the JavaScript tab on
one side and the Console on the other, and

72
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.340
then you can do the same thing.

73
00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.330
And then you would hit Run and
that would print out to your console.

74
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.050
And so, that's sort of the workflow of
how you're gonna be doing this project.

75
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.220
So, throughout the day,

76
00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.250
what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna
be implementing two parts of this app.

77
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.610
We're gonna be making
the data structures and

78
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.710
we're gonna be adding
some functionality to it.

79
00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.580
There's no UI,
this is not like a CSS class.

80
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.730
It's only gonna be two
parts of your application.

81
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.260
Again, the data structures and
the functionality, like very crude,

82
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.460
basic functionality.

83
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.760
And if you think about it,
apps are really just three parts.

84
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.750
You have your data,
you have your view, like the UI, and

85
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.680
then you have the functionality behind it.

86
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.990
So you're kind of making
two-thirds of an app, anyway.

87
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.480
So even though it might not be flashy,
you still, that's two-thirds done.

88
00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.520
And if anyone makes a UI for
it, please send it to me.

89
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.167
That'd be really cool to see that, cool.

90
00:05:48.167 --> 00:05:50.440
So we explored the files.

91
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.240
Some other fun things is, I do give
free tutoring to people who correct.

92
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.760
Whoever sends the most corrections
to either my slides, my

93
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.750
exercises, clarifies any unclear
directions or gives me anything like that.

94
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.670
I do give free tutoring.

95
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.950
For more directions on free
tutoring you can see this tab and

96
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:15.970
note on free tutoring.

97
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.120
And yeah, and so what we're gonna do
is we're just gonna do the objects one.

98
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.070
You're gonna open that here.

99
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.500
And this is just a readme file, so
you don't have to download it or anything.

100
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.510
You can just go through the projects.

101
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.830
And I'll give you about 15 or
20 minutes or so to go through this.

102
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:37.750
And I'll just walk around.
