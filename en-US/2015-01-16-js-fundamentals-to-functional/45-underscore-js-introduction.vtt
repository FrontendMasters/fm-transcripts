[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.058 --> 00:00:07.663
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So now we're finally
to the point where we can talk about

3
00:00:07.663 --> 00:00:08.590
Underscore.

4
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.200
So we talked scope,
we talked about how closures worked.

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.410
We talked about the complexities between
parameter versus an argument and

6
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.240
how all these components work together and
now we can use the utility library like

7
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.930
Underscore js which combines all these
concepts into a handy library that

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.820
gives us all the utility functions that
allows us to do some pretty cool things.

9
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.898
So first thing is,
has anyone used the library here?

10
00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:40.980
Raise your hand if you've
used a library before.

11
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.130
Cool, so underscore is just a library.

12
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.971
Which basically a library, in a sense,

13
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:53.490
is just a collection of
methods available to you.

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.440
So we have a jQuery library
which provides us a function,

15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.940
a jQuery function that looks like this.

16
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.980
And we can call it like that.

17
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.730
Underscore is a library that gives
us an object that's an underscore

18
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.350
with a bunch of different
properties on it.

19
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.350
So the syntax for underscore,
you'll see an underscore and a dot.

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.110
And you can just imagine that somewhere in

21
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.810
the library it says var_ = some object.

22
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.270
And that's why we used .notation.

23
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.772
And then we can say, _.

24
00:01:30.772 --> 00:01:34.320
Some method = some function.

25
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.910
And then,
some function that does something.

26
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.860
So that's how it's working at it's core
and we just include that JavaScript

27
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.860
file in our HTML, we have access to
all those methods and let's just check

28
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.940
out the underscore library just to
kinda get a feel of what it looks like.

29
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.460
So this is just their documentation, you
can see that, that underscore comes with

30
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.360
all of these handy functions that you
can use that make your code easier.

31
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.260
The cool thing about underscore
is it works in all environments,

32
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.430
it's just pure JavaScript, it's not like
jQuery where it only works in the browser.

33
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.930
So you could use underscore, for
example, in node it's used a lot.

34
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.330
Or if you're doing some
hardware stuff as well.

35
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.500
Cool.

36
00:02:26.868 --> 00:02:27.394
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then,

37
00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:31.150
you can also look at the annotated
source code which is really interesting.

38
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.210
You can see like how they
actually write underscore and

39
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.160
it's all annotated so
you could see like how reduce is

40
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.231
written here, and, let's see,
at the very bottom.

41
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:52.415
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So that's really
handy, if you're getting stuck and

42
00:02:52.415 --> 00:02:55.311
you kinda wanna see how it's
really working underneath.

43
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:56.431
Yup?

44
00:02:56.431 --> 00:02:58.951
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you say jQuery
only works in the browser?

45
00:02:58.951 --> 00:02:59.871
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.

46
00:03:02.151 --> 00:03:06.274
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If you think about it,
jQuery's all about selecting DOM nodes and

47
00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:10.260
then manipulating them and
then putting them back into the DOM.

48
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.580
The DOM is lives in the browser.

49
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.600
Cool.

50
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.870
So we're gonna talk about
a couple of underscore methods.

51
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.330
How to use them, and
then I'm kinda gonna set you use and

52
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.830
let you just explore and
work with underscore on some exercises.
