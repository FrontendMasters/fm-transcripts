2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.491
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now
what about function bodies?

3
00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:08.333
It's a little bit different
than a function definition,

4
00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:12.470
just because a body is what's located
between these two parentheses.

5
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.610
I'm sorry, these two curly brackets.

6
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.600
And the important thing, while you guys
are searching for more function bodies.

7
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.470
The important thing to note about
a function body is that it's never run

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.950
until call time.

9
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.880
So, the code located within
those curly brackets

10
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.310
is not interpreted until
you call the function.

11
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.670
So in this case, for nameImprovers,
since we're never calling it,

12
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.900
this code here Never runs.

13
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.092
And it has no real value.

14
00:00:46.672 --> 00:00:47.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.340
So let's see, who's next?

16
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.655
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the body, before
the .hide, the body of the function?

17
00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:01.920
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not quite, so
we are looking for two curly brackets.

18
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.340
That's how we know it's a function body,
unless it's an object or

19
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.100
in a statement, but on this slide.

20
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How about
after function vowel?

21
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
right here we have a function body.

22
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:18.462
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then Ben?

23
00:01:18.462 --> 00:01:23.358
&gt;&gt; Ben: In the on function,
the second parameter, yeah and

24
00:01:23.358 --> 00:01:26.960
then starting at the-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so right here.

25
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.820
That's a function body.

26
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.500
And Jake, what's important to
remember about function bodies?

27
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.539
&gt;&gt; Jake: They are the verbs.

28
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.030
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Functions are verbs,
that's true.

29
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.850
You can, what's it called?

30
00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.136
Phone a friend?

31
00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:52.686
&gt;&gt; Jake: [LAUGH] I can?

32
00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:56.756
Kim, help me out here, you're my lifeline.

33
00:01:56.756 --> 00:01:57.760
&gt;&gt; Kim: What was the question?

34
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.530
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's important
to remember about function bodies?

35
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.139
&gt;&gt; Kim: They're inside brackets.

36
00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.210
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, that's true.

37
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.010
But there's something else,
I'm looking for like one specific thing,

38
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.690
anyone remember?

39
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.050
&gt;&gt; Jake: They're not called till.

40
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.920
&gt;&gt; Kim: Doesn't call.

41
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, so
it's not run until we call the function.

42
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.210
Awesome.

43
00:02:16.774 --> 00:02:17.774
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

44
00:02:17.774 --> 00:02:24.210
Speaking of calling the function, we have
this thing called call-time invocation.

45
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.190
So, just for
fun we can improve someone's name.

46
00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:36.475
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Whoops, uh-oh.

47
00:02:36.475 --> 00:02:42.170
Okay, so
I'm just gonna put this function here.

48
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.960
And notice, I just put nameImprover there.

49
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.621
We have it, right.

50
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.310
When I type out nameImprover it shows
me what the function looks like.

51
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.380
That's not call time, that's just me
checking what is stored at that variable.

52
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.940
Just like when we say var x equals 2 and
I just type x, it returns 2, same thing.

53
00:03:07.983 --> 00:03:08.784
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So.

54
00:03:13.264 --> 00:03:16.144
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How many people
here really love their name?

55
00:03:18.204 --> 00:03:18.924
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No?

56
00:03:18.924 --> 00:03:19.983
Everyone?

57
00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:22.184
Okay, so we have three people
who really love their name.

58
00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:25.743
So everyone else,
could use some name improvement.

59
00:03:25.743 --> 00:03:28.003
So, everyone else just volunteered.

60
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:32.482
&gt;&gt; Jake: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] Full of tricks

61
00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:34.166
and traps.

62
00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:38.440
I mean it's Halloween time,
it's time for those things.

63
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.042
Okay, so of those people.

64
00:03:42.392 --> 00:03:44.391
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
you can recommend a friend.

65
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.211
He wants to nominate someone.

66
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:46.931
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Tanner.

67
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:47.811
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Tanner, okay.

68
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.751
&gt;&gt; Tanner: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] And

69
00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:56.420
who has an adjective that I can borrow?

70
00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.888
Has to be a nice one,
can't be like stinky or something.

71
00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:02.278
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Buff.

72
00:04:02.278 --> 00:04:03.797
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Buff?

73
00:04:03.797 --> 00:04:05.337
Okay.

74
00:04:05.337 --> 00:04:07.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Buff.

75
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.357
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nice.

76
00:04:08.357 --> 00:04:12.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome, so
Colonel Tanner McBuff pants.

77
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nice.

78
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.260
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You can call your
lawyer and arrange a new name if you want.

79
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.560
I know it's way better, right?

80
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.150
&gt;&gt; Tanner: I'll get right on it.

81
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.438
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, [LAUGH] All
right, I'm gonna call you that for

82
00:04:22.438 --> 00:04:23.722
the rest of the day.

83
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:24.582
&gt;&gt; Tanner: I appreciate that.

84
00:04:24.582 --> 00:04:26.183
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, no problem.

85
00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:32.550
So notice here, so we have, let's just
look at the inside of our function,

86
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.830
that we have our parameter here,
name and our adjective here.

87
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:46.390
And they have no value until we pass
these parameters, tanner and buff, right?

88
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.348
And then suddenly they have value and
suddenly the code in this line and

89
00:04:51.348 --> 00:04:55.142
in between the inside
the function body gets called.

90
00:04:57.385 --> 00:05:00.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And so that timing,
that order is really important.

91
00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:05.687
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

92
00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:06.627
So.

93
00:05:08.387 --> 00:05:10.067
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where
else do we see call time?

94
00:05:16.131 --> 00:05:17.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Hide.

95
00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:18.590
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, hide.

96
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:19.910
Here's a perfect example.

97
00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:20.930
So, we're calling hide.

98
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.950
Where else?

99
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.000
So, where did we leave off?

100
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.830
So, we had Jake and then Kevin.

101
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.443
Where else do we see call time?

102
00:05:32.443 --> 00:05:33.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: ForEach.

103
00:05:33.823 --> 00:05:38.611
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes,
right here, absolutely and

104
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:41.842
then, for sure
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Long.

105
00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:42.461
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where?

106
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.464
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Long?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

107
00:05:43.464 --> 00:05:45.023
on this call time.

108
00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:47.885
[SOUND] Let's see, so

109
00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:52.661
I guess we'll start again at John.

110
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:54.141
&gt;&gt; John: Dollar sign?

111
00:05:54.141 --> 00:05:56.700
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
here, we're calling jQuery.

112
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.750
Anything else?

113
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:01.440
There's one more.

114
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Long and val?

115
00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.850
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
they're just log.

116
00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.690
So console.log.

117
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.400
There's two of them.

118
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:14.710
So, mm-hm?

119
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.740
&gt;&gt; Ben: Are you saying call time
is another word for invocation?

120
00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:19.569
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
exactly the same.

121
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.980
&gt;&gt; Ben: But
not on val because that's just a function.

122
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:25.491
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Val here?

123
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.182
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: That's a parameter.
&gt;&gt; Kim: Parameter.

124
00:06:26.182 --> 00:06:27.941
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's
a parameter name.

125
00:06:27.941 --> 00:06:31.091
&gt;&gt; Ben: But that parentheses.

126
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:31.731
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This one?

127
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:34.132
&gt;&gt; Ben: No.
&gt;&gt; Jake: That's defining the function.

128
00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:35.032
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so you see.

129
00:06:35.032 --> 00:06:37.013
&gt;&gt; Jake: And the parameters that
are gonna be passed into it.

130
00:06:37.013 --> 00:06:39.253
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Whenever
you see the keyword function.

131
00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:40.013
&gt;&gt; Ben: Uh-huh.

132
00:06:40.013 --> 00:06:43.003
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Followed by two
parentheses, that's not call time,

133
00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:46.010
that's part of the function definition.

134
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.881
So, the main thing to pay attention
to is just the keyword function.

135
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:52.776
If it's followed by parentheses,

136
00:06:52.776 --> 00:06:57.290
then that's just,
that's gonna be the parameters.

137
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:02.040
&gt;&gt; Ben: So, like function val
that's kinda inline definition.

138
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.880
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so that's just
an anonymous function that we're passing

139
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.260
to fourEach.

140
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.885
And then val is gonna be
a parameter to that function.

141
00:07:10.885 --> 00:07:14.220
Mm-hm, cool.
