00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:08.788
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [NOISE] So
here we have an example of our inner box.

2
00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:11.780
So we just have a doubly nested object.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.140
We can handle this, right?

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.500
It's only two.
And with property full equals true.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.348
What's gonna happen in
this next line here?

6
00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:26.211
[BLANK AUDIO] How

7
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.247
about Ben,

8
00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:36.708
what do you think?

9
00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:43.670
&gt;&gt; Ben: For what, what's the question?

10
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's
the line going to do?

11
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:53.490
&gt;&gt; Ben: Set the property of height
of the objects in your box to 10.

12
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.179
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Good guess,
any one think something different?

13
00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:06.592
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undefined because
innerBox doesn't have quotes around it.

14
00:01:06.592 --> 00:01:07.870
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

15
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.370
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Good.

16
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.890
Good catch.

17
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.385
Seeing if you guys are awake.

18
00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:12.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: There's

19
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:13.675
coffee in the back.

20
00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:17.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, awesome.

21
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.130
So we fixed that.

22
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.780
Cool.
That will pass.

23
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.650
What about the last line there?

24
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.602
That's not gonna work.

25
00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:30.770
And so, what my request to you is

26
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.700
make that last line work without
changing the last line itself.

27
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.450
And we want innerBox2 is
gonna be in different object.

28
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.960
So, there's a few things you're gonna
need to do to make that last line work.

29
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.200
You can do it here above it so
that that won't throw an error.

30
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.629
So I'll give you guys about
five minutes to do it.

31
00:02:03.488 --> 00:02:07.920
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
also note innerBox2 is a different object.

32
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.068
It's not the same as innerBox.

33
00:02:11.018 --> 00:02:13.138
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Did
you have a question?

34
00:02:13.138 --> 00:02:15.538
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Did you mean
to do that without quotes?

35
00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:20.389
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, so
this line will not be changed.

36
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.385
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Box to be another box.

37
00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:27.648
[CROSSTALK] a sibling of inner box?

38
00:02:27.648 --> 00:02:29.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, exactly.

39
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.550
So it'll be another object.

40
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.228
So you need to create
a new object in there.

41
00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:40.024
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so
our online friend Soncar sorry if I

42
00:02:40.024 --> 00:02:43.650
pronounce your name wrong.

43
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.400
Answered this, so I'll just go ahead,
type out the answer.

44
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.686
So, to do this, we first need to
create a variable called innerBox2.

45
00:02:55.686 --> 00:03:00.551
We know that because innerBox2
doesn't have quotes, and

46
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.750
we can call it something else even.

47
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.779
So we can call it otherBox.

48
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.040
And then we have to unbox,

49
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.060
put a property called otherBox, and
set it equal to an empty object.

50
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.840
So we need to do this first so
that we have an empty object,

51
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.880
on box, to add the full property too.

52
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.610
So now we say, box Which is our object,

53
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.160
and then we say, look, that's a variable.

54
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.505
What is that variable?

55
00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:42.830
So, it's otherBox, so you can imagine
then that this is swapped out, so

56
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.130
that would say box, otherBox, which.

57
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.990
We know is an empty object here.

58
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.510
And then we'll just put in
nested property on there.

59
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.118
I'm sorry, we'll just put a property
onto that object, set equal to false.

60
00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:07.369
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And that's the answer.

61
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.990
Whoops.

62
00:04:16.858 --> 00:04:18.858
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Any
questions on how we got from.

63
00:04:22.198 --> 00:04:24.150
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: From
just the empty object?

64
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.749
From the variable to the empty object?

65
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Couldn't you just assign

66
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.360
inner box two to box [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then it would say,

67
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.270
then it would be kind of like saying this,

68
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.430
which wouldn't make sense because we
don't have But you really don't want,

69
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.710
that's called like circular pointing.

70
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.760
That's like, something you don't wanna do.

71
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.758
But, yeah, you can't really do that.

72
00:05:05.178 --> 00:05:08.390
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Because we don't have
a property called box on box, right?

73
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.868
So you could, create it, I guess, but.

74
00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:25.976
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So Kate asks,

75
00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:30.680
when do you know to set
a variable to an empty object?

76
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.970
Do you always have to do that,
is it a best practice thing?

77
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.850
Well, if you're creating an object-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Can you repeat the question?

78
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.120
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.
The question is,

79
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.270
when do you know to set
a variable to an empty object and

80
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.200
do you always have to do that,
and is it a best practice thing.

81
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.670
So whenever you create an object from
scratch, that's what you have to do.

82
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.570
There is constructor notation
with a keyword new and

83
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.390
then a capital O object, but
that's not a best practice in general.

84
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.452
And so,
it's better just to initialize your empty

85
00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:13.198
object using the curly brackets.

86
00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:29.757
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what this does is
that it just creates an empty object so

87
00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:31.948
that you can add properties to it.
