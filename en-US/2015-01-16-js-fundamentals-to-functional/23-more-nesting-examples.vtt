1
00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:08.788
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [NOISE] So
here we have an example of our inner box.

2
00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:11.780
So we just have a doubly nested object.

3
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.140
We can handle this, right?

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.500
It's only two.
And with property full equals true.

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.348
What's gonna happen in
this next line here?

6
00:00:19.348 --> 00:00:26.211
[BLANK AUDIO] How

7
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:30.247
about Ben,

8
00:00:30.247 --> 00:00:36.708
what do you think?

9
00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.875
&gt;&gt; Ben: For what,

10
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.500
what's the question?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's the line going

11
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.430
to do?
&gt;&gt; Ben: Set the property of

12
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.936
height of the objects in your box to 10.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Good

13
00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:56.947
guess, any one think something

14
00:00:56.947 --> 00:01:03.464
different?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Undefined because

15
00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:06.914
innerBox doesn't have quotes around it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.

16
00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:07.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

17
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:08.370
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Good.

18
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.890
Good catch.

19
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.680
Seeing if you guys are awake.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

20
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: There's coffee in

21
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.540
the back.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

22
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.690
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, awesome.

23
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.130
So we fixed that.

24
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.780
Cool.
That will pass.

25
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.650
What about the last line there?

26
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.602
That's not gonna work.

27
00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:30.770
And so, what my request to you is

28
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.700
make that last line work without
changing the last line itself.

29
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.450
And we want innerBox2 is
gonna be in different object.

30
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.960
So, there's a few things you're gonna
need to do to make that last line work.

31
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.200
You can do it here above it so
that that won't throw an error.

32
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.196
So I'll give you guys
about five minutes to do

33
00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:03.806
it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

34
00:02:03.806 --> 00:02:07.920
also note innerBox2 is a different object.

35
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.320
It's not the same as innerBox.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Did

36
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.009
you have a question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Did you mean to

37
00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.331
do that without quotes?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, so this line will

38
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:24.385
not be changed.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Box to be another box.

39
00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:29.480
[CROSSTALK] a sibling of inner box?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, exactly.

40
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.550
So it'll be another object.

41
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.228
So you need to create
a new object in there.

42
00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:36.594
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so

43
00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:43.650
our online friend Soncar sorry
if I pronounce your name wrong.

44
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.400
Answered this, so I'll just go ahead,
type out the answer.

45
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.686
So, to do this, we first need to
create a variable called innerBox2.

46
00:02:55.686 --> 00:03:00.551
We know that because innerBox2
doesn't have quotes, and

47
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.750
we can call it something else even.

48
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.779
So we can call it otherBox.

49
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.040
And then we have to unbox,

50
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.060
put a property called otherBox, and
set it equal to an empty object.

51
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.840
So we need to do this first so
that we have an empty object,

52
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.880
on box, to add the full property too.

53
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.610
So now we say, box Which is our object,

54
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.160
and then we say, look, that's a variable.

55
00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.505
What is that variable?

56
00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:42.830
So, it's otherBox, so you can imagine
then that this is swapped out, so

57
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.130
that would say box, otherBox, which.

58
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.990
We know is an empty object here.

59
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.510
And then we'll just put in
nested property on there.

60
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.184
I'm sorry, we'll just put
a property onto that object,

61
00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:07.369
set equal to false.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And that's the answer.

62
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:17.072
Whoops.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Any

63
00:04:17.072 --> 00:04:22.523
questions on how we got from.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: From

64
00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:24.150
just the empty object?

65
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.720
From the variable to the empty object?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Couldn't you just assign

66
00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.360
inner box two to box [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then it would say,

67
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.270
then it would be kind of like saying this,

68
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.430
which wouldn't make sense because we
don't have But you really don't want,

69
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.710
that's called like circular pointing.

70
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.760
That's like, something you don't wanna do.

71
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.814
But, yeah, you can't really

72
00:05:00.814 --> 00:05:05.618
do that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Because

73
00:05:05.618 --> 00:05:08.390
we don't have a property
called box on box, right?

74
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.868
So you could, create it, I guess, but.

75
00:05:24.888 --> 00:05:25.976
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So Kate asks,

76
00:05:25.976 --> 00:05:30.680
when do you know to set
a variable to an empty object?

77
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.970
Do you always have to do that,
is it a best practice thing?

78
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.070
Well, if you're creating an object-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Can you repeat

79
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.130
the question?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.

80
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.270
The question is, when do you know to
set a variable to an empty object and

81
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.200
do you always have to do that,
and is it a best practice thing.

82
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.670
So whenever you create an object from
scratch, that's what you have to do.

83
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.570
There is constructor notation
with a keyword new and

84
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:06.390
then a capital O object, but
that's not a best practice in general.

85
00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.452
And so,
it's better just to initialize your empty

86
00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:13.198
object using the curly brackets.

87
00:06:26.148 --> 00:06:27.351
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what this does is

88
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:31.948
that it just creates an empty object so
that you can add properties to it.
