[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:07.714
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So now we're gonna
look over some functions that you may or

3
00:00:07.714 --> 00:00:13.340
may not have seen before, and kind of
identify the parts of these functions.

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.550
So we have four of them.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.170
Some of them I took from jQuery.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.290
Has anyone here done jQuery before?

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.230
Okay, cool.

8
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.140
So a lot of people have done jQuery.

9
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.771
So the first thing is
the function definition, so

10
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:32.717
where do we see some functions defined?

11
00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:39.503
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So let's just go
in a line, let's start with the front,

12
00:00:39.503 --> 00:00:41.010
this way.

13
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: At the top
there's an anonymous function

14
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.360
assigned to nameImprover.

15
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.954
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
we're defining a function here.

16
00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:51.221
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then, Rich?

17
00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.470
&gt;&gt; Rich: We're looking for
where we're assigning functions?

18
00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.730
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where
we're defining functions.

19
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.020
&gt;&gt; Rich: We're defining functions?

20
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.340
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It could be assigned
a variable, it could be anonymous.

21
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.270
&gt;&gt; Rich: And not being,
the body height not down there.

22
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.940
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right there,
that's our next one.

23
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.610
We're defining a function there,
and it has no name.

24
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.110
That's okay.

25
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.310
&gt;&gt; Rich: That one doesn't have a name?

26
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.940
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, there's no name.

27
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.839
&gt;&gt; Rich: It's just passing.

28
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.150
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
it's a function definition.

29
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.990
It's also an argument.

30
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.620
Yeah.

31
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.230
And who sees the last one, Tanner?

32
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.446
&gt;&gt; Tanner: There's a function and
you click there.

33
00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:37.700
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right here,
function definition.

34
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.040
So these are the function
definitions in this code.

35
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.800
And just for

36
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.530
clarification nameImprover function
is this handy function that we use.

37
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.490
I it for when our friends have babies or
they have names that need to be improved.

38
00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.200
('body').hide() is a jQuery thing
that's just gonna hide the body.

39
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.860
So if I just did, goes to here.

40
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.610
Wait, is there even jQuery?

41
00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.890
Yes.

42
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.940
No there's not jQuery.

43
00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.917
Let's see if it works.

44
00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.260
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so it does work.

45
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.926
So, body dot hide, will just hide it,
and then dot show will show it.

46
00:02:20.926 --> 00:02:25.820
And then array.forEach,
forEach is a native iteration method,

47
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.270
it's gonna just loop over the array and
call this function a bunch of times.

48
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.720
And then button on click is another

49
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.240
jQuery functionality, and
it's just adding an event listener,

50
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.650
so whenever you click on the button
it's going to counsel log this.

51
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.750
This, don't press my buttons.

52
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.060
So that's just an explanation of what
functions we're looking at right now.

53
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.080
Cool.
And so what about function names?

54
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.390
And I use name a little bit loosely.

55
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.810
I refer to both as the function,

56
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.170
the name function as well as a variable
that has a function stored at.

57
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.840
So let's talk about,
where do we see function names?

58
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.240
So can we start with just Grace,
and we'll just keep going, so

59
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.830
you can anticipate when
you have to go next?

60
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.234
&gt;&gt; Grace: I don't see a name.

61
00:03:20.263 --> 00:03:21.760
&gt;&gt; Grace: Forward function?

62
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.618
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so like here,
for example, would be a name.

63
00:03:24.618 --> 00:03:25.310
&gt;&gt; Grace: Okay.

64
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.978
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

65
00:03:25.978 --> 00:03:27.923
&gt;&gt; Grace: That's the name for
the function versus the variable.

66
00:03:27.923 --> 00:03:31.030
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
well, it's variable.

67
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.440
I'm using name here loosely to mean both
the variable name that it's stored at and

68
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.260
the name itself.

69
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.112
Yeah, cuz there's another way.

70
00:03:41.112 --> 00:03:47.382
We could write function like this,

71
00:03:47.382 --> 00:03:51.986
function nameStaySame.

72
00:03:56.132 --> 00:03:57.419
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
this is another one.

73
00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.474
This is just a really
complicated algorithm that

74
00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:08.281
will just keep your name
the same versus this other one.

75
00:04:08.281 --> 00:04:11.190
That will change your name and
make it better.

76
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.446
This is another way to name our function.

77
00:04:15.446 --> 00:04:20.675
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is that the same as
the first decoration of a function where,

78
00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:25.699
in the sense that you're adding
[COUGH] in front of it versus

79
00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.250
adding it to the global,
I don't know if that make sense.

80
00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So when we name-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

81
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.660
you never wanna do that one that
you just did the stay name.

82
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.670
I don't know.

83
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You
could do it this way.

84
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.410
The only thing about doing it this
way is that your function name and

85
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.000
definition is hoisted, and
that can be, it can get messy.

86
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.
[COUGH]

87
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, it can get messy,

88
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.000
so I would just recommend
that you always just use

89
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.610
this one cuz you know that the rules for
variable hoists in things are the same and

90
00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.100
you don't have to keep track of this and-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [COUGH] Okay.

91
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.890
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
there's some situations like if

92
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.380
you have two functions of the same
name in the if else statement and

93
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.690
then you run it after
the if else statement.

94
00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.740
Then it can get mixed up and

95
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.470
do things that you don't expect because
of the hoisting works in this case.

96
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

97
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.290
So, you can do it but
you just have to be careful.

98
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.390
But just to be on the safe side, just
always do it this way, it's not gonna hurt

99
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:39.420
you it's just var, use one extra word
it's not gonna make a big difference.

100
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.920
So, okay.

101
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.480
So back to where we were.

102
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.220
Here's a name.

103
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.300
Then we also have a name here.

104
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.010
And then William, see any more names?

105
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.090
&gt;&gt; William: You just added
one called nameStaySame.

106
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.029
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm,
what about any other ones?

107
00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.960
&gt;&gt; William: I dont see any other ones.

108
00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What about hide?

109
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.114
That's a name, right?

110
00:06:06.114 --> 00:06:08.610
&gt;&gt; William: Yeah, yes.

111
00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:09.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

112
00:06:10.144 --> 00:06:12.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Kim,
do you see any name?

113
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.640
&gt;&gt; Kim: On.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: On.

114
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.930
Absolutely.

115
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:16.520
On is a name.

116
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.799
And, Andy?

117
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.420
&gt;&gt; Andy: ForEach?

118
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.984
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,
forEach is a function name.

119
00:06:27.037 --> 00:06:27.577
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Joe?

120
00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:30.647
&gt;&gt; Joe: Log.

121
00:06:30.647 --> 00:06:32.673
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, log.

122
00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.300
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see,
are we missing any?

123
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:39.800
There's one more.

124
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.890
It's kind of a trick question, though.

125
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.160
Anyone see it?

126
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.050
&gt;&gt; Kim: The dollar?

127
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
yeah, a dollar sign.

128
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.380
So this jQuery dollar sign
is actually a function.

129
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.850
It's not a special syntax,
it's just a function.

130
00:06:52.850 --> 00:07:00.680
So you can imagine that jQuery somewhere
in its library says var $ = function.

131
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:08.300
And then you know it returns like
a jQueryObject somewhere, right?

132
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.453
Oops.

133
00:07:12.376 --> 00:07:12.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: More like this.

134
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.400
So, some things that may
seems a little different,

135
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.330
they're actually following the same rules.

136
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.380
And I find that very comforting actually,
to know that.

137
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.640
That jQuery isn't doing something like
totally crazy that, I don't understand.
