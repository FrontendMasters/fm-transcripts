00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:42.865
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: My name's Bianca, I am
a JavaScript evangelist for Hack Reactor,

3
00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:46.870
which is an immersive JavaScript
school in San Francisco.

4
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.590
We have some cohorts coming up for

5
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.410
our remote program as well as our
in-person program in San Francisco.

6
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.590
More details on that at hackreactor.com,
and let's see.

7
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.000
So I guess we'll just jump in.

8
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Most of us have completed
the pre-event survey.

9
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.860
So I kind of have an idea
of your background,

10
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.450
your expectations for
the class and things like that.

11
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.810
Normally I would do a round of
introductions, but since we're running

12
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.200
a few minutes behind, I'll probably
save that for, I'll come around and

13
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.170
meet the in person people one by one
during exercise time just for fun.

14
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.350
So, this is a two part class.

15
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.370
Day one we're going to do
some JavaScript fundamentals.

16
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.800
We're going to go over and deep dive
objects and rays of deep functions, and

17
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.090
then tomorrow,
we are going to go even further and take

18
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:46.100
what we learned today and practice some
functional JavaScript on patterns with it.

19
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.060
So, lot's of fun stuff coming up.

20
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.148
For those of you who haven't seen,
we have some links to the slides,

21
00:01:52.148 --> 00:02:00.300
it's a bit.ly/js102-slides1,
as well as bit.ly/js102-exercises,

22
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.030
which that's where we'll be
going during the exercise time.

23
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.210
All right, well let's get started.

24
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.930
So first thing is who is this class for?

25
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.080
So maybe you've been
studying on your own for

26
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.170
a few months on Code Academy,
Khan Academy or more.

27
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.280
And you're thinking, okay,
what's that next step?

28
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.500
I've done all the beginner resources but

29
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.340
I want more, and
I can't seem to find that middle ground.

30
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.800
And I'm not able to solidify and

31
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.530
practice those concepts that I was
introduced in these beginner tutorials.

32
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.340
So that's what this class is for.

33
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.280
So it's someone who's
completed a tutorial before,

34
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.370
you have at least two to six months
experience practicing JavaScript, and

35
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.700
you want to solidify those fundamentals.

36
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.470
Maybe you're just looking for
more practice, and

37
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.620
even better, maybe you're interested
in becoming a hack reactor.

38
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.380
And this class initially
designed actually to help people

39
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.860
who don't have any traditional computer
science experience get into Hack Reactor.

40
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.290
So for those of you who are interested in
that, this course is perfect for that.

41
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.700
Cool, so like I mentioned before,
this is a two

42
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.510
part course that I teach in the evenings
and on the weekend at Hack Reactor.

43
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.660
Part one, again, is just solidifying
core JavaScript principles.

44
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.306
We're gonna do that using a project for
practice.

45
00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:38.940
And then part two, we're gonna be getting
started with some functional concepts

46
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.480
in JavaScript as well as introducing
the Underscore Library and how to use it.

47
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.820
And then afterwards, you can use this
foundation to keep growing as an engineer

48
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.670
or apply at Hack Reactor.

49
00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.270
Or I don't know, I think the next step
is take over the world generally.

50
00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:59.730
But you know, whatever you want to do.
