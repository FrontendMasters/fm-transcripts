[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.750
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so
knowing what we know now about map.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.810
Maybe it makes more sense instead of
using each, to rewrite this using map.

4
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:21.360
So that's our next step and I'll give you
about five minutes to get started with.

5
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.480
Transiting each function into the map
function, that saves all of our

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:33.772
animal objects into our farm.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

7
00:00:33.772 --> 00:00:36.632
so what's the first thing
that we need to do here?

8
00:00:41.992 --> 00:00:45.342
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Maybe do _.map.

9
00:00:45.342 --> 00:00:46.452
What are we gonna map over,

10
00:00:46.452 --> 00:00:50.195
do you known John?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The animal names.

11
00:00:50.195 --> 00:00:52.856
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

12
00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:54.241
No, I ran out of animal names.

13
00:01:05.242 --> 00:01:06.196
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're mapping over

14
00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:11.385
the animal names.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What

15
00:01:11.385 --> 00:01:13.162
function do we want to put here?

16
00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:30.723
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What was it?
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

17
00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.725
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No, this is speak.

18
00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.586
No we definitely want to
call AnimalMaker somewhere.

19
00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:40.782
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]

20
00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:41.767
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hmm?

21
00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you

22
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.500
just pass in AnimalMaker,

23
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.260
map is gonna call it with the name.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's true.

24
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.477
Let's do it out the long way and
then we'll all clean it up.

25
00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:59.502
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're passing,

26
00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:04.490
what's being passed here?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Name of the animal.

27
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.970
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then what did we

28
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.570
want to do next?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Call AnimalMaker with that

29
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.888
name.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, absolutely,

30
00:02:13.888 --> 00:02:19.350
name.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then what else?

31
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.210
There's a couple,

32
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.590
small, minor things that we need to do.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well,

33
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.442
we gotta put in the farm.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

34
00:02:24.442 --> 00:02:27.983
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Which you can do farm

35
00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:28.894
=
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

36
00:02:33.414 --> 00:02:35.154
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And one last but very,

37
00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.670
very important thing.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Return.

38
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.510
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, we need to return

39
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:48.672
it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome.

40
00:02:48.672 --> 00:02:52.980
So now we see we've kind
of condensed a line or so.

41
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.270
We have our animal names.

42
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.540
We're passing each name,
and we're returning it.

43
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.550
And now we don't have to do this extra
operation which is pushing it to the farm.

44
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.190
It just happens automatically,
which is awesome.

45
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.410
And and as John mentioned,
we can even go a step further and

46
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.590
not even have this function and we could
just put AnimalMaker directly here.

47
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.630
Then it will just call it with
the name as the first parameter.

48
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.480
So in fact we can just leave it like that.

49
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.670
And that's even shorter.

50
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.990
And then we can see, if you understand
the mechanics of how an app works,

51
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.710
you know already that we're
using animalNames and

52
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.010
you're making an animal
with each animal name.

53
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.890
So that even makes it more clear
to yourself and you're looking

54
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.100
back at the code, and you're like,
what does this code do again, I forgot.

55
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.520
Or your colleagues are going
to pick up code after you.

56
00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.985
And that's super common, everyone pretty
much uses it and should understand it.

57
00:04:01.985 --> 00:04:03.990
Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

58
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:10.060
I'm confused by what the return value
AnimalMaker is, it's an object, right?

59
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.983
But what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I guess I'm confused

60
00:04:14.983 --> 00:04:16.533
how this is working.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure, so

61
00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:20.994
whatever this function returns is
gonna be stored as an array, and

62
00:04:20.994 --> 00:04:25.640
then we're gonna store that array,
it's gonna be farm.

63
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.050
So map here is going to return an array of
whatever the callback function returns.

64
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.340
So our callback function is AnimalMaker.

65
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.440
So for the first loop,

66
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.450
the first iteration with Sallie,
we're going to call AnimalMaker.

67
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.220
We're going to pass the value, right?

68
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.920
The value is Sallie, so
that's the name to the AnimalMaker.

69
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.080
We enter into this function body and we
turning an object with one property on it.

70
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.450
That's the property called speak and
which is a function

71
00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.650
that all does is console.log my name is,
and it said it's name.

72
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.660
But, we're not,
we're not calling speak right?

73
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.340
No, you're not calling speaker,
you're calling AnimalMaker and

74
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.830
it's returning this.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: We're

75
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.770
not doing anything with the animals
once they get back into

76
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.530
the farm array.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not yet.

77
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: So that's why I

78
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.840
think we're kind of struggling with.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.

79
00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: The name of the function is

80
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.380
AnimalMaker, yet it's really making
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's making

81
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.520
animal objects.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So it's storing the animal

82
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.690
objects in the array?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, and

83
00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.700
we're giving our animals
the ability to speak.

84
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.765
So if we never use this function,
we'd all have just really quiet animals.

85
00:05:33.765 --> 00:05:34.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: [INAUDIBLE]

86
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:35.410
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Which might be better,

87
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.550
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Now if you did

88
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.590
access, let's say the first
index of the farm, list,

89
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.430
it'll basically spit out in the console,
hi my name is whatever that first tally or

90
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.981
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

91
00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:51.190
Mm-hm.

92
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.660
So we can just go ahead and delete this.

93
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:58.040
And we can run this code and
we can kind of look at it.

94
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.910
And so it's important,
wherever you're running this code,

95
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.560
that you have the underscore
library included.

96
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.370
Because it's a library,
if you just run it on any site.

97
00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.710
These methods aren't available but
luckily we know for

98
00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.990
sure that the underscore library
site has underscore on it.

99
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.250
That'd be funny if it didn't, but.

100
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.600
And so let's check out our farm.

101
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.790
So we see our farm is three different
objects with the speak function on it.

102
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.820
And then if we wanted someone in our
farm to speak what we could do is we

103
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.650
could say the first one.speak and
it says my name is Sally and

104
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.880
then we could try the next one and
it will say their name.

105
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.150
Like that.

106
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:55.210
And we can investigate, let's just
an object with one property, speak.

107
00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:07.288
Is that clear?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

108
00:07:07.288 --> 00:07:10.604
for those on chat who are asking
about the explicit return,

109
00:07:10.604 --> 00:07:13.200
we are explicitly
returning something here.

110
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.705
And then also inside of the map _map

111
00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:23.700
function.It's also returning in there, so
