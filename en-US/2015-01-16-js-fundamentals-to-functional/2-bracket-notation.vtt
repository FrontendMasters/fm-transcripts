[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:07.975
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We talked about
dots now let's talk about brackets.

3
00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:12.890
Dots and brackets are pretty
similar as far as functionality.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.221
The syntax is very different though and
the rules are also different.

5
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:22.340
We're here storing material,
a property material on our box and

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.356
it's gonna work exactly the same.

7
00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:31.180
Box dot material is more or less
equivalent to box bracket quote material.

8
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.260
You can kind of think of these two
syntax as interchangeable to an extent.

9
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.610
What is this gonna return?

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.940
How about you,
right here with the green sweatshirt.

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cardboard.

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.120
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
totally cardboard.

13
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.190
We can use them interchangeably,

14
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.920
it doesn't affect if we store
a value using bracket notation.

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.170
It doesn't affect our dot notation at all.

16
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.626
And then here, what about,
green sweater in the second row?

17
00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.121
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What
is this gonna return?

18
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:08.206
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cardboard as a string.

19
00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.366
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Totally,
cardboard as a string.

20
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:15.560
Here we are, I'm assigning values,
so here's us assigning a value.

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.046
Here's us accessing a value.

22
00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:26.179
If we then wanted to store a value,
we can just put it in cb and

23
00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.425
then we can reference it later.

24
00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:32.465
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

25
00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:33.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Real quick question.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

26
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is that updating
the property or the value on the object?

27
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.251
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Which one?

28
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:40.506
The second line?

29
00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:44.602
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just the brackets, is that
updating the property name or the value?

30
00:01:44.602 --> 00:01:48.566
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's adding a property
and a value, so it's doing both.

31
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.933
It's not updating anything,
it's just adding it.

32
00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.262
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Can you use that
syntax in the second line there and

33
00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:02.765
then reference it with
a dot notation later?

34
00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:03.885
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So they're interchangeable?

35
00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:07.376
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, they're
completely interchangeable, totally.

36
00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:13.027
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: They're completely
interchangeable until they're not and

37
00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:16.510
we're gonna talk about when they're not,
and so we're gonna talk about variables.

38
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.743
When we're gonna store our string value,
our property name as a variable,

39
00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:25.178
we're gonna then need to
use bracket notation but

40
00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:30.108
the important difference here is
we're not gonna use the quotations.

41
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:36.560
We see here in our code that we have our
key here is going to be holding the string

42
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.490
material and then we then put in
our bracket step variable name.

43
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.370
What's this going to return?

44
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.350
What about grey shirt, last row.

45
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.905
I wish you guys had name tags.

46
00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Material?

47
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.610
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is
there gonna be material?

48
00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.650
Anyone wanna help him out?

49
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.185
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: These are keys, right?

50
00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:03.830
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes,

51
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.660
this is gonna be the key.

52
00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Got it.

53
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.600
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
so it's gonna be cardboard.

54
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah.

55
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.384
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Key is, so
if we just like here said console.log,

56
00:03:14.384 --> 00:03:18.610
for example, key,
then that would be material.

57
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.440
That make sense?

58
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.140
Do you have a question?

59
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: A question in the chat room.

60
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.970
The difference between box
with the curly braces, and

61
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.480
then if you were to do
box equals new object.

62
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm, they're different.

63
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.490
One is constructor notation, and
one is object literal notation.

64
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.750
I'm going to recommend that you
always use object literal notation.

65
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.650
The key word new, is something you see a
lot on subject oriented languages as well

66
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.790
as object oriented Java script
when you are doing those patterns.

67
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.510
That's a little out of the scope of this
class but always just use this one and

68
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.661
you'll be fine but
they're essentially the same thing.

69
00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:01.482
Great question.

70
00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:10.639
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Variables, the
important thing again about variables is

71
00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.420
we're not going to put quotations
around it because why?

72
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.470
Anyone have a hunch on what would happen
if we put quotations around key here?

73
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.951
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Then it's just a string.

74
00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:25.224
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Absolutely,
then it's just a string and

75
00:04:25.224 --> 00:04:30.741
it will be interpreted by your browser
as a property on box called key,

76
00:04:30.741 --> 00:04:33.655
which then would return undefined.

77
00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:41.610
Because we don't have a property
called key on our object.

78
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.875
Cool.

79
00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:48.659
The cool thing about bracket notation as
well is that it's actually evaluating its

80
00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.130
expressions.

81
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.520
With dot notation, you can't put any
expressions or any code to be evaluated.

82
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.070
You can't say box dot 1 + 1.

83
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.380
That just wouldn't work.

84
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.210
However, with bracket notation,
we can do that.

85
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.080
Here's an example of us calling
a function in our bracket notation.

86
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.180
Here's a function creatively named func,
we call that function and

87
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.410
it returns a string material.

88
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.073
Think this is going to work, guys?

89
00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:22.887
What's gonna print?

90
00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:27.870
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I need to start mixing

91
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.130
this up because everyone can just guess
cardboard and it's always gonna be right,

92
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.910
I just realized.

93
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Can you back to that
previous slide when you did the key thing?

94
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.280
Because you used quote.

95
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.115
Now if there happened
to be a key called key-

96
00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:42.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Uh-huh.

97
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Would it then return
the value of that quote unquote key or

98
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.440
whatever just like-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yup.

99
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

100
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.216
Exactly. &gt;&gt; Speaker 7: All right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Hey,

101
00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:54.160
Bianca, what are the rules around
single quote, double quote?

102
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.790
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The rules
are that you should do as I say and

103
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.770
not as I do because I'm not
consistent in these slides with it.

104
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.290
But be consistent,
they have to match one side or the other.

105
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.640
Generally, wherever you work,
hopefully has a style guide or

106
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.260
if you're contributing to open source,

107
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.650
there's a style guide that will
tell you which one they prefer.

108
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.680
You want it to match on your code base but
there isn't really a rule.

109
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.050
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: The interpreter figures
that out that single quote and

110
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.750
double quote, same thing?

111
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.660
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, but for
example, if you did key like this,

112
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.010
that wouldn't work.

113
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.190
Yeah.

114
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.700
But yeah, it's all the same.

115
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.440
You had a question in the back?

116
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: That was
the question in the chat room.

117
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.870
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

118
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.820
Cool.
My slides are strategically created with

119
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.075
single and double quotes so
that it brings up that question.

120
00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:44.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's all planned.

121
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Another question
is can properties be Unicode?

122
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.700
If so, how do I quote them?

123
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.918
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm, I'm not sure,
that's a good question.

124
00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:56.630
Email me, bianca@hackwrecker.com and
I'll get back to you on that.

125
00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: It's Escape and
then slash u and then the hex code.

126
00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:02.370
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Really?

127
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.718
Cool.
So the answer to that is you Escape it,

128
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:07.600
dash u?

129
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Slash u and the hex code.

130
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.920
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Slash u and
the hex code.

131
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: There is the Unicode.

132
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Very cool, thank you.

133
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Could you
give an example of Unicode?

134
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.506
Is that difficult?

135
00:07:17.506 --> 00:07:21.120
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know,
you guys are asking hard questions.

136
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.295
What would be an example of the Unicode?

137
00:07:24.295 --> 00:07:26.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: I have no idea.

138
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know,
we can look it up.

139
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.535
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Maybe like ampersand,
or similar thing.

140
00:07:33.396 --> 00:07:39.555
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Local is A,
which is what, 65?

141
00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:41.176
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know.

142
00:07:41.176 --> 00:07:44.880
I don't have an example of Unicode,
but that's an easy Google search.

143
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.300
Cool.

144
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.550
So Hermanth is the person
I should be upset with

145
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.486
who are asking me silly questions.

146
00:07:55.486 --> 00:08:01.020
[LAUGH] Okay, cool.

147
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.990
Here we go, expressions.

148
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.620
Our bracket notation, unlike dot notation,
can handle expressions, and

149
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.240
that's pretty cool.
