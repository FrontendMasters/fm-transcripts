[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.055 --> 00:00:07.975
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We talked about
dots now let's talk about brackets.

3
00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:12.890
Dots and brackets are pretty
similar as far as functionality.

4
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.221
The syntax is very different though and
the rules are also different.

5
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:22.340
We're here storing material,
a property material on our box and

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.356
it's gonna work exactly the same.

7
00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:31.180
Box dot material is more or less
equivalent to box bracket quote material.

8
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.260
You can kind of think of these two
syntax as interchangeable to an extent.

9
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.610
What is this gonna return?

10
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.930
How about you,

11
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.940
right here with the green sweatshirt.

12
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cardboard.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

13
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.120
totally cardboard.

14
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.190
We can use them interchangeably,

15
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.920
it doesn't affect if we store
a value using bracket notation.

16
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.170
It doesn't affect our dot notation at all.

17
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.319
And then here, what about,

18
00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:04.455
green sweater in the second row?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What

19
00:01:04.455 --> 00:01:08.206
is this gonna return?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cardboard as a string.

20
00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:09.185
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Totally,

21
00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.366
cardboard as a string.

22
00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:15.560
Here we are, I'm assigning values,
so here's us assigning a value.

23
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.046
Here's us accessing a value.

24
00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:26.179
If we then wanted to store a value,
we can just put it in cb and

25
00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:28.425
then we can reference it later.

26
00:01:31.106 --> 00:01:32.562
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Real

27
00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:33.090
quick question.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

28
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.682
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is that updating

29
00:01:34.682 --> 00:01:39.251
the property or the value on the object?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Which one?

30
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:42.127
The second line?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Just the brackets, is that

31
00:01:42.127 --> 00:01:46.218
updating the property name or the value?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's adding a property

32
00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:48.566
and a value, so it's doing both.

33
00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:49.931
It's not updating anything,

34
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:55.684
it's just adding it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Can

35
00:01:55.684 --> 00:02:00.639
you use that syntax in the second
line there and then reference it

36
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:03.240
with a dot notation later?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Absolutely.

37
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.885
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So they're interchangeable?

38
00:02:03.885 --> 00:02:04.861
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, they're

39
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:11.037
completely interchangeable, totally.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: They're

40
00:02:11.037 --> 00:02:13.027
completely interchangeable
until they're not and

41
00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:16.510
we're gonna talk about when they're not,
and so we're gonna talk about variables.

42
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.743
When we're gonna store our string value,
our property name as a variable,

43
00:02:21.743 --> 00:02:25.178
we're gonna then need to
use bracket notation but

44
00:02:25.178 --> 00:02:30.108
the important difference here is
we're not gonna use the quotations.

45
00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:36.560
We see here in our code that we have our
key here is going to be holding the string

46
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.490
material and then we then put in
our bracket step variable name.

47
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.370
What's this going to return?

48
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.350
What about grey shirt, last row.

49
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.905
I wish you guys had name tags.

50
00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:56.028
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Material?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is there

51
00:02:56.028 --> 00:02:56.610
gonna be material?

52
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.185
Anyone wanna help him out?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: These are keys, right?

53
00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:03.610
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

54
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.402
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, this is gonna be

55
00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:05.750
the key.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Got

56
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.360
it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

57
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.730
so it's gonna be cardboard.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah.

58
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Key is, so

59
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.975
if we just like here said console.log, for

60
00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:18.610
example, key, then that would be material.

61
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.440
That make sense?

62
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.440
Do you have a question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: A question in the chat room.

63
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.590
The difference between box with the curly
braces, and then if you were to do box

64
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.480
equals new object.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm, they're different.

65
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.490
One is constructor notation, and
one is object literal notation.

66
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.750
I'm going to recommend that you
always use object literal notation.

67
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.650
The key word new, is something you see a
lot on subject oriented languages as well

68
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.790
as object oriented Java script
when you are doing those patterns.

69
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.510
That's a little out of the scope of this
class but always just use this one and

70
00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.661
you'll be fine but
they're essentially the same thing.

71
00:04:00.661 --> 00:04:07.711
Great question.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Variables,

72
00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:12.102
the important thing again about
variables is we're not going to put

73
00:04:12.102 --> 00:04:14.420
quotations around it because why?

74
00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.470
Anyone have a hunch on what would happen
if we put quotations around key here?

75
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.951
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Then it's just a string.

76
00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:23.074
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Absolutely,

77
00:04:23.074 --> 00:04:28.217
then it's just a string and
it will be interpreted by your browser

78
00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:33.655
as a property on box called key,
which then would return undefined.

79
00:04:33.655 --> 00:04:41.610
Because we don't have a property
called key on our object.

80
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.875
Cool.

81
00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:48.659
The cool thing about bracket notation as
well is that it's actually evaluating its

82
00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.130
expressions.

83
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.520
With dot notation, you can't put any
expressions or any code to be evaluated.

84
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.070
You can't say box dot 1 + 1.

85
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.380
That just wouldn't work.

86
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.210
However, with bracket notation,
we can do that.

87
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.080
Here's an example of us calling
a function in our bracket notation.

88
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.180
Here's a function creatively named func,
we call that function and

89
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.410
it returns a string material.

90
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.073
Think this is going to work, guys?

91
00:05:21.073 --> 00:05:24.270
What's gonna print?
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

92
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.870
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I need to start mixing

93
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.130
this up because everyone can just guess
cardboard and it's always gonna be right,

94
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.190
I just realized.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Can you back to that

95
00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.200
previous slide when you did the key thing?

96
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.280
Because you used quote.

97
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.115
Now if there happened
to be a key called key-

98
00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:42.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Uh-huh.

99
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:43.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Would it then return

100
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.980
the value of that quote unquote key or

101
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.440
whatever just like-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yup.

102
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Okay.

103
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:47.826
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah. Exactly.

104
00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:52.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: All right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Hey, Bianca, what are the

105
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.710
rules around single quote, double quote?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The rules are that

106
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.790
you should do as I say and

107
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.770
not as I do because I'm not
consistent in these slides with it.

108
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.290
But be consistent,
they have to match one side or the other.

109
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.640
Generally, wherever you work,
hopefully has a style guide or

110
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.260
if you're contributing to open source,

111
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.650
there's a style guide that will
tell you which one they prefer.

112
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.710
You want it to match on your code base but

113
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.760
there isn't really a rule.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: The interpreter figures that

114
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.050
out that single quote and

115
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.910
double quote, same thing?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, but for example,

116
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.010
if you did key like this,
that wouldn't work.

117
00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.190
Yeah.

118
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.700
But yeah, it's all the same.

119
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.523
You had a question in the back?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: That was the question

120
00:06:33.523 --> 00:06:35.870
in the chat room.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

121
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.820
Cool.
My slides are strategically created with

122
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.075
single and double quotes so
that it brings up that question.

123
00:06:42.075 --> 00:06:43.170
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: [LAUGH]

124
00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's all planned.

125
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Another question

126
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.630
is can properties be Unicode?

127
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.000
If so, how do I quote them?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm, I'm not sure,

128
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.918
that's a good question.

129
00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:56.630
Email me, bianca@hackwrecker.com and
I'll get back to you on that.

130
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: It's Escape and

131
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:02.370
then slash u and then the hex code.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Really?

132
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.718
Cool.
So the answer to that is you Escape it,

133
00:07:06.718 --> 00:07:08.236
dash u?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Slash u and

134
00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:10.160
the hex code.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Slash u and

135
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.170
the hex code.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: There is the Unicode.

136
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Very cool, thank you.

137
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Could you give an example

138
00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.500
of Unicode?

139
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.445
Is that difficult?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know,

140
00:07:18.445 --> 00:07:21.120
you guys are asking hard questions.

141
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.352
What would be an example of the Unicode?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: I have no

142
00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:26.570
idea.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know,

143
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.931
we can look it up.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 8: Maybe like ampersand, or

144
00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:35.106
similar thing.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 10: Local is A,

145
00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:41.176
which is what, 65?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know.

146
00:07:41.176 --> 00:07:44.880
I don't have an example of Unicode,
but that's an easy Google search.

147
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.300
Cool.

148
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:53.550
So Hermanth is the person
I should be upset with

149
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.486
who are asking me silly questions.

150
00:07:55.486 --> 00:08:01.020
[LAUGH] Okay, cool.

151
00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.990
Here we go, expressions.

152
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.620
Our bracket notation, unlike dot notation,
can handle expressions, and

153
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.240
that's pretty cool.
