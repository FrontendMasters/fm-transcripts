00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.020
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Who here didn't quite
understand recursion before this class,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.115
and then now feels like they
have a better understanding?

3
00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:10.300
You don't have to just, you don't have
to just say that to make me feel good.

4
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.830
I just wanna get your insight.

5
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.800
&gt;&gt; Student1: Sure, I definitely have
a better understanding of it now.

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.290
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,
what got you there?

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.820
&gt;&gt; Student1: I think the practice,
the implementing it.

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.380
It was helpful for
me when we talked about visualizing it.

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.540
I think you talked about
a snowball up a hill or something.

10
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.829
For me, I picture like sort of a staircase
that comes out and you walk back up.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
adding metaphors helped?

12
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.970
&gt;&gt; Student1: Yeah.

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.142
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Got it.

14
00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:52.413
&gt;&gt; Student2: I really liked when we
walked step by step through the code and

15
00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:54.800
you had paced it and keep track.

16
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.080
That really I think clicked for me.

17
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.550
&gt;&gt; Student1: Yeah that was key.

18
00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.320
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, yeah.

19
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.220
So kind of walking through the stack
frames and how the code is being executed?

20
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.720
Cool.

21
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.050
Cool, anything else?

22
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.680
Anything new, so
you probably heard of recursion before and

23
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.880
you probably used it before, right?

24
00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:19.436
Is there a different way that you
used it in this class that you hadn't

25
00:01:19.436 --> 00:01:21.229
used it before, that way?

26
00:01:25.558 --> 00:01:28.230
&gt;&gt; Student3: That's
the same as the last idea.

27
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.080
It was really helpful,
tracking just the stack frames,

28
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.710
the one you showed us, using the example.

29
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.875
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so that's kind
of changed the way you thought about

30
00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:43.370
recursion.

31
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.570
Yeah, instead of maybe something
magically is happening somewhere.

32
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.995
Or there's a lot of visualizations where
it has a function side of a function side

33
00:01:50.995 --> 00:01:52.825
of a function side of a function.

34
00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:54.120
Have you guys seen those?

35
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.190
Maybe if you research recursion,
like Fibonacci N -1,

36
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.730
N-2, and
it is like a bunch of parentheses?

37
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
Have you guys looked at that?

38
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.050
Who's seen that one?

39
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.870
&gt;&gt; Student1: I think I may have.

40
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:13.387
It's been a long, long time though,
ten years ago, maybe.

41
00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:14.594
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, cool.

42
00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:17.789
I guess my next question would be,
is this more helpful than that?

43
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.120
&gt;&gt; Student1: Going through those steps and
everything that's, I think,

44
00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.570
very important.

45
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:26.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

46
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.550
&gt;&gt; Student4: The part I didn't
really get before this class was,

47
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.511
I think before when I played
around with recursion,

48
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:40.290
the recursive call was always
the last thing in the method.

49
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.480
Which kinda changes how, or
it doesn't change how it works, but

50
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.850
it changes what you can do with it.

51
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.343
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student4: If you act on it after,

52
00:02:49.343 --> 00:02:51.270
it's differently.

53
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student4: It's different.

54
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.541
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we learned how the location,

55
00:02:55.541 --> 00:03:00.269
this is gonna be important later today,
of the recursive call,

56
00:03:02.772 --> 00:03:08.960
Matters in terms of execution order.

57
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.893
Cool, awesome, yeah, this is really
important cuz we're gonna go there

58
00:03:13.893 --> 00:03:17.810
later when we start traversing
trees in different orders,

59
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.270
the recursive calls are important.

60
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.239
Awesome, was there any exercise
that was particularly helpful?

61
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.960
&gt;&gt; Student1: When you walked us through,

62
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.200
there was one of them I
couldn't figure out on my own.

63
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.973
I think it was recursive multiplier or
something like that.

64
00:03:33.973 --> 00:03:40.180
And then it was you walking us through
the solutions to that that helped me.

65
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.144
I don't remember if it was recursive
multiplier or what was the other one?

66
00:03:44.144 --> 00:03:45.876
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sort,

67
00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:48.540
almost like a reversing an array or
something.

68
00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.004
&gt;&gt; Student1: Yeah it was multiply,
cuz then the reverse was the one after it.

69
00:03:53.004 --> 00:03:53.857
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Got it.

70
00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:56.536
Cool.

71
00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:02.048
So further study would be tail call
optimization which is available in ES6.

72
00:04:02.048 --> 00:04:06.050
