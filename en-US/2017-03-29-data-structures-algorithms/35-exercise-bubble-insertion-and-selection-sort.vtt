&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What we're gonna
be doing is we're gonna implement

2
00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.860
all of the elementary sorting algorithms,
bubble, insertion, and selection.

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.950
Keep in mind that when you're testing
out your code, the fact that it's coming

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.770
out sorted at the end isn't necessarily
a sign that you're doing it right.

5
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.470
Because for these particular sorting
algorithms, what you wanna check for

6
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.160
is that you're doing it in the order.

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.000
And the logic is the same.

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.550
So you might need to put a debugger
in there and walk through your code.

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.837
Maybe you throw in console dot logs or
whatever your style is,

10
00:00:30.837 --> 00:00:34.200
just to make sure that it's going
in the order that you expect.

11
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.510
Because it can be easy to
think you got them all right

12
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.750
just because it comes out sorted, when
actually, the logic's a little bit off.

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.090
Like maybe you're doing an insertion sort
for a selection sort, or vice versa, or

14
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.759
you're accidentally doing
the same thing twice.

15
00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:50.720
So keep that in mind.
