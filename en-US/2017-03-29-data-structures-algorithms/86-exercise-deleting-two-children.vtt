WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so we
practiced a little bit with the first two

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.660
cases when we did the min max and
we did it again for just more generic.

3
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.720
So case three is, if we wanted
to delete 2 here from our tree.

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.660
What we want to do is find the minimum

5
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.180
of the right tree, right, which is 4,
and swap it with a deletion.

6
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.300
So afterwards, you want the 4
to be in place of where the 2

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.432
was.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

8
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.214
&gt;&gt; Student 1: That's

9
00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:47.723
weird.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

10
00:00:47.723 --> 00:00:50.485
want me to say it one more time?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

11
00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:54.047
when we're deleting a note in a middle and
it has two children, whether or

12
00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:56.700
not it has subtrees or
whatever, it doesn't matter.

13
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.336
You wanna find the minimum
of the right subtree,

14
00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:08.298
and swap it,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: With the to

15
00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:12.991
be deleted.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: That will always work,

16
00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:16.650
because values on the right will always
be bigger than values on the left.

17
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.669
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so all of these.

18
00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:20.703
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Yeah.

19
00:01:20.703 --> 00:01:21.855
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All of these are gonna

20
00:01:21.855 --> 00:01:23.192
be less than 6.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Yes.

21
00:01:23.192 --> 00:01:24.802
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then since 4 is

22
00:01:24.802 --> 00:01:26.010
less than 5,

23
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.541
it's still meeting our requirement.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Yes,

24
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:31.073
okay.

25
00:01:31.073 --> 00:01:33.413
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Witchcraft.

26
00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:34.590
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

27
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.696
So something to think about,
again, is what if we deleted 6?

28
00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:46.556
And that's something to think about.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

29
00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:53.060
any questions before
we dive into the code?

30
00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.173
&gt;&gt; Student 1: So the, cuz if we delete 6,

31
00:01:58.173 --> 00:02:06.182
we can't do the thing we were doing
on the left cuz there is no min.

32
00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:09.850
No, there'd still be a min.

33
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.994
You just wanted us to think about that,

34
00:02:12.994 --> 00:02:14.670
not talk about it?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well,

35
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.416
it's something you're going to have
to account for in all of your code.

36
00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:21.960
And we're gonna go through
the solution for it, but

37
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.350
I want you to come up with it on your own,
basically, before I tell you.

38
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.040
But just think about it.

39
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.930
Think about the edge cases
whenever you're creating your,

40
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.700
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Your data structures

41
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.868
and algorithms, right?

42
00:02:34.868 --> 00:02:39.657
It's just good practice to try to predict
what edge cases might arise that you

43
00:02:39.657 --> 00:02:41.360
might need to account for.

44
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.760
Cuz it's useful to show,
if you're in an interview,

45
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.070
it's useful to show your interviewer,
I'm thinking about the big picture here.

46
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.738
I'm not tunnel visioned.

47
00:02:48.738 --> 00:02:53.226
I'm an engineer who is thoughtful and
intentional about my code and

48
00:02:53.226 --> 00:02:54.810
considers edge cases.

49
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.564
And there are more edge cases beyond this,
right?

50
00:02:58.564 --> 00:03:03.242
There's the traditional edge cases,

51
00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:08.775
like what if it's empty or
what if It's null?

52
00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:09.558
Some stuff like that.

53
00:03:09.558 --> 00:03:11.811
Cool?
All right, well,

54
00:03:11.811 --> 00:03:14.820
I think you know what to do.

55
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.048
You might want to pair, pseudocode it out,

56
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:24.079
maybe you want to finish
the other exercises first,

57
00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.956
so deleting the 1 and the 2.

58
00:03:26.956 --> 00:03:29.850
I'm sorry, the 0 and the 1.

59
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.173
Before moving on to the second one so

60
00:03:34.173 --> 00:03:38.694
that you make sure you can test your code.
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Should these be different

61
00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:41.252
methods or
one awesome method that does all

62
00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:43.923
the things?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I like to have

63
00:03:43.923 --> 00:03:47.425
different methods just to break it out,

64
00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:53.429
but,
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Chef's choice.

65
00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.617
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Exactly, there was one

66
00:03:56.617 --> 00:04:01.874
more thing I wanted to say about this.

67
00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:03.620
Yeah, it might be useful.

68
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.819
Actually, before we do
this let's implement

69
00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:16.408
a validation method that's gonna validate.

70
00:04:16.408 --> 00:04:18.467
It's going to,
you call it on your tree and

71
00:04:18.467 --> 00:04:22.261
it returns true if it's a valid binary
search tree, and returns false if not.

72
00:04:22.261 --> 00:04:25.053
And this will help you as
you're building all this,

73
00:04:25.053 --> 00:04:28.610
to make sure that you're
doing your swaps correctly.

74
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.976
So it's just a way to make testing easier,
cool?

75
00:04:30.976 --> 00:04:32.330
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Okay.

76
00:04:36.224 --> 00:04:40.860
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great, any questions?

77
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.620
So and that's also in the exercises, so
if you go into the binary search tree

78
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.960
exercises there is the is validate and

79
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.320
it should be right before
the delete node method.

80
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.347
Not required but super helpful.

81
00:04:56.347 --> 00:04:58.999
It's also a very common
interview question so

82
00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.930
it doesn't hurt to have
that one in your tool belt.
