1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.690
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna
pseudocode out contains, so

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.400
I'm going to delete our pseudocode.

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.010
I'll leave that down there so
we know what our.

4
00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:10.724
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

5
00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:16.360
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
here's our contains.

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.290
So, what is the contain's
interface look like?

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.018
Like what is the input and
what is the output?

8
00:00:25.018 --> 00:00:28.309
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Input is a value.

9
00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:33.012
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hmm?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Input is a value.

10
00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:34.483
And output is true or false.

11
00:00:34.483 --> 00:00:37.225
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yup.
It takes a value, and

12
00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:41.180
we expect it to return true.

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.060
Actually we just have to type true or

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.080
false based on if we find that value
in the tree that we're searching.

15
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.340
Cool?

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.380
That's contains.

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.370
That's it.

18
00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.017
You can expect most contains
methods to have this interface.

19
00:01:01.017 --> 00:01:02.141
Okay.

20
00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:08.030
So, who here has pseudo-coded out
contains already, or coded it?

21
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.780
Okay.

22
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.280
Starting.

23
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.050
What might be the first
thing we want to check?

24
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.300
Right, because for contains,

25
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.780
we're going to be checking through
the entire tree, well not the entire tree.

26
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.335
We'll be checking through
the tree as much as we need to.

27
00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:31.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: First I check
this.value is equal to value?

28
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
what if the root is what we need?

29
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.080
And then we can just call it a day, right?

30
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.250
So this again is going to be our tree and
our tree.

31
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.970
Instance is gonna be our root node,
everything else points.

32
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.993
Or everything else actually
is inside of it, right?

33
00:01:55.993 --> 00:02:00.088
Because we have these nested objects.

34
00:02:00.088 --> 00:02:07.517
Okay, so is the current

35
00:02:07.517 --> 00:02:12.719
value = value?

36
00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What
about if it's yes?

37
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And it's true you can exit.

38
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.487
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [CROSSTALK]
this is true, we over return, true.

39
00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:31.780
Sound good?

40
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.681
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What else do

41
00:02:32.681 --> 00:02:34.736
we have to check for?

42
00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:36.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,
you probably see if it's greater or

43
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.160
less than the current values.

44
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.154
So that you can know
which direction to go.

45
00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:41.395
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

46
00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:46.210
Greater than or less

47
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.314
than current value.

48
00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:53.174
Okay?

49
00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:56.220
Then what?

50
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.006
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So if it's greater go right.

51
00:02:58.006 --> 00:02:58.506
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

52
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if it is greater,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Go right.

53
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.288
I'm putting quotes around here cuz
it's a little more complicated, but

54
00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:11.402
we've done this before.

55
00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:18.400
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
then the other one is, check if it is.

56
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.911
Less than right?
And then we go left,

57
00:03:20.911 --> 00:03:24.470
we're gonna gor left, go left.

58
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.990
Cool?

59
00:03:28.261 --> 00:03:30.050
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What else?

60
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.765
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Nothing else.

61
00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:37.305
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nothing else?

62
00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:39.500
What if we don't find it?

63
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You go right, of course.

64
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.710
Call contains again.

65
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.290
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hmm,
yeah we can dig in to right means.

66
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.360
So we're gonna call contains
on the next node, right?

67
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.330
How do we do that again?

68
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.270
We just talked about-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Whatever

69
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.470
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That right?

70
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.320
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That contains value.

71
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
call on the value.

72
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.049
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you say we have
to go back right again or whatever?

73
00:04:12.148 --> 00:04:14.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You're gonna have to
return fall somewhere in there.

74
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.330
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

75
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you don't find it.

76
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.470
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if you just wanna
just look at a picture really quick And

77
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.560
what we're gonna be doing.

78
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.482
So, if we're looking for,
we're looking for let's say 19, right?

79
00:04:26.482 --> 00:04:30.100
19 does not exist,
if we're the computer we don't know that.

80
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.620
So we start here at 11,
we say, 11 are you 19?

81
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.957
11 says, no sorry I'm not 19.

82
00:04:36.957 --> 00:04:41.890
And then it says, okay are you less than?

83
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.512
Is 19 less than you?

84
00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:44.250
And then it's like, no.

85
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.700
Is 19 greater than you?

86
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.258
Yes.
And then we go right, right?

87
00:04:47.258 --> 00:04:51.642
We say this dot right contains,
it starts all over again and it says,

88
00:04:51.642 --> 00:04:53.236
hey 15, are you 19?

89
00:04:53.236 --> 00:04:58.690
15 says no and then says, but
you know then are you less?

90
00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:59.590
Are you greater?

91
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.030
If you're greater, go right and
it says twenty are you nineteen?

92
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.074
Twenty says no,
then they check if it's less it is less.

93
00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:14.566
So we go a left and
then say eighteen are you nineteen?

94
00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:15.840
Eighteen says no.

95
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.200
Then you check to the right because
its greater and there's nothing there.

96
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That means false.

97
00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then, that's
when we know that we have not found it.

98
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But
you would never have to backtrack, right?

99
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.560
Because they're all ordered.

100
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.590
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nope.

101
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.370
Yeah, because its always ordered,
so you always know that nineteen,

102
00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:38.890
if it's going to be anywhere.

103
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:40.625
It's gonna be somewhere
to the right of 18.

104
00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:44.130
And since there is there is nothing,
there is no right sub tree of 18.

105
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:48.560
There is no way that it exist in the tree
and that's just the constraints of a BST.

106
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.679
Cool.
So that's how we do it.

107
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.978
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we got the returning true part right.

108
00:06:05.194 --> 00:06:08.241
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Should we do some
stack tracing and kind of feel out what

109
00:06:08.241 --> 00:06:12.370
happens, and then see if we can
find a place where it makes sense?

110
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.930
Does that seem like a natural next step?

111
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:14.577
Or does someone have a hunch?

112
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
we'll feel it out.

113
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.190
Let's open up our thing.

114
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.700
Okay.

115
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:29.940
Alright.

116
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.880
So we're gonna look for
we're gonna pass in 19.

117
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.160
Okay?

118
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.601
Here, I'll write it out
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

119
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.125
let's keep open our picture.

120
00:06:48.764 --> 00:06:49.616
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay?

121
00:06:49.616 --> 00:06:53.810
So we can kind of look at the picture
while we're doing the pseudocode.

122
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.422
So we're gonna look for 19,
what's the current value at the beginning?

123
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 11.

124
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 11,
so they're not equal.

125
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:09.290
So is it greater?

126
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.030
Yes, right.

127
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.720
So we go right, which means we recurse.

128
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:22.260
We're gonna push another on to the stack,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right?

129
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.221
And so current value.

130
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:31.750
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'm gonna call current
value CV, if that's okay with all of you.

131
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.200
So current value for
the right child is 15, right?

132
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:36.548
CV here is 11.

133
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:40.997
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Are we following here,
current value is 15.

134
00:07:40.997 --> 00:07:43.210
We've gone to the right.

135
00:07:45.722 --> 00:07:48.820
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
are they equal, false?

136
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.498
Is it greater, true?

137
00:07:51.498 --> 00:07:55.550
And we're gonna go to the right again.

138
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.170
So what's our current value
the third time around?

139
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.460
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 20.

140
00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:08.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yup, 20.

141
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.970
So we went, started here and
we went right and we went right.

142
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:11.750
We are at 20.

143
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:14.920
Are they the same?

144
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:22.195
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nope, is it greater?

145
00:08:22.195 --> 00:08:26.420
No.
Nope, okay, so it is lesser.

146
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.821
This is true.
And then we're gonna go left.

147
00:08:29.821 --> 00:08:33.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You would have to
see if there's right and left.

148
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.820
Yeah, so
we wanna make sure there is a right or

149
00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:37.730
left because if we- Before you called it.

150
00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.230
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, if we.

151
00:08:41.607 --> 00:08:43.795
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's the way you
would know if it isn't there.

152
00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:46.914
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm,
but let's just finish it and

153
00:08:46.914 --> 00:08:49.451
then we'll put in our checks.

154
00:08:52.018 --> 00:08:55.660
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So 18, no.

155
00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.180
Is it greater?

156
00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:57.680
No.

157
00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then we have.

158
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The value,
it doesn't change, right?

159
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.216
It's 19.
CV is 18.

160
00:09:03.216 --> 00:09:07.840
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, well, we say
this.left and there isn't even a left.

161
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.960
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I see.

162
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.550
Right, so
we might have an upset browser saying,

163
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.550
you can't call contains of undefined or

164
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:22.420
something some Something like that,
which isn't saying no.

165
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.559
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we're gonna have to check.

166
00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right?

167
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.140
Where's our main.

168
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.423
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So like if there
is a right, then you go right.

169
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.973
If there is a left, then you go left.

170
00:09:48.659 --> 00:09:51.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then, what?

171
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.010
We still haven't returned false somewhere.

172
00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If there's not a right or
there's not a left.

173
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.890
To short or return false.

174
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.140
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, but
where should we put that in?

175
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:05.025
At what point do we know
there is no left or right.

176
00:10:05.025 --> 00:10:07.266
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: At the very end.

177
00:10:07.266 --> 00:10:08.477
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hmm, yeah.

178
00:10:08.477 --> 00:10:13.333
So the easiest way to do this is just to

179
00:10:13.333 --> 00:10:17.259
return false at the very end.

180
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:24.040
Something like that.
Does that make sense?

181
00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:30.091
Because if it returns true,
it's going to return true.

182
00:10:30.091 --> 00:10:32.130
Otherwise it's going to return false.

183
00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.280
There may be a bug here.

184
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.880
That I want you to debug,
when you implement.

185
00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:41.140
But this is on the right track.

186
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:45.068
Are you guys ready to implement this?

187
00:10:45.068 --> 00:10:47.560
Yep.

188
00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.060
Okay.

189
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:54.970
I'm going to say,
is 20 minutes reasonable?

190
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:55.470
Do you think?

191
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.124
Or do you want 30 minutes?

192
00:11:02.117 --> 00:11:02.828
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 20 and you'll check in.

193
00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:03.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 20.

194
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.285
Okay, I'll check in at 20.

195
00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:12.980
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, just to let you
know what we're doing, we're going to our

196
00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.180
binary search tree, and we are going
to finish implementing contains.
