WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.605
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we check if the
node has a left or a right, so just one or

2
00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.509
the other.

3
00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.580
If it has a left,
then you're gonna set the left.

4
00:00:10.384 --> 00:00:11.540
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're
gonna set the left.

5
00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To
the parent's relationship, right?

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.280
So the parent
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is

7
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.290
to the right of the 15, right?

8
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.600
So we want to, we're here,
this is our current value.

9
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.010
This is our this dot left, right.

10
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.919
We wanted to change our this dot
left to our parent dot right.

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.520
Or whatever our parent's relationship is.

12
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.470
Cool, so we could save that into
a variable called position or

13
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.130
something like that.

14
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.810
And then just use bracket notation,

15
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.687
say this bracket position
equals this dot left.

16
00:00:57.687 --> 00:00:58.910
Does that make sense?

17
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:11.823
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, if has a left,
then set the left to the parent's

18
00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:16.430
relationship for the to-be-deleted node.

19
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.431
It's really verbose, does anyone
have a shorter way of saying that?

20
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.450
In English though.

21
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:31.014
I'm trying to make it
more English than code.

22
00:01:31.014 --> 00:01:33.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Look to
the parent's relationship for it.

23
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.835
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We could just decide on
an acronym and then remember what it means

24
00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:43.520
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what about the PRD?

25
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.630
That doesn't stand for
anything bad, right?

26
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Not that I know of.

27
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.700
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, me either.

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.868
So parent's relationship to the deleted.

29
00:01:50.868 --> 00:01:52.711
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thank you.

30
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:53.568
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

31
00:01:53.568 --> 00:01:54.667
Cool.

32
00:01:58.991 --> 00:02:02.407
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: PRD.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

33
00:02:02.407 --> 00:02:04.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Did you look it up?

34
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

35
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.501
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No.
[LAUGH]

36
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:11.555
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That was super funny.

37
00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:13.255
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What about PRDN.

38
00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:18.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It doesn't matter.

39
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.780
PRD is fine.

40
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.784
It's just funny what it
actually stands for.

41
00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:22.490
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is it bad?

42
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.175
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: PRDN actually
doesn't have a reference.

43
00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:28.387
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's,like if you're

44
00:02:28.387 --> 00:02:32.511
a runner, pre-race dump.

45
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:33.765
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
we're gonna do PRDN.

46
00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:37.471
Just deciding.

47
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:40.661
Okay, so PRDN, okay, so

48
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:46.180
if it has a left then
you're going to set the.

49
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.433
Actually we're going to set

50
00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:58.193
the PRDN to this left It's easier.

51
00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:04.281
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?
And that's how we're swapping it out.

52
00:03:04.281 --> 00:03:09.340
So, if right, then

53
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.900
set PRDN to this.right.

54
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.580
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is it if it has one,
if it matches The value of that there?

55
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.210
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So.

56
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we already,

57
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.500
so the current node is the match node.

58
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.770
And so at this point we wanna say,
you know,

59
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.830
if it has a child then we wanna swap it.

60
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.590
And we wanna just make sure that
we're swapping it to the right place.

61
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.950
So what you really could do,
actually let me see, two

62
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.160
this dot left or this dot right.

63
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.390
Right assuming you are sending it
to the value not the entire node.

64
00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.000
Because the node but

65
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.225
actually either way it does not matter
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?

66
00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:09.161
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

67
00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:13.030
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What
else are we missing?

68
00:04:19.993 --> 00:04:22.518
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We were not suppose to do,
for this too.

69
00:04:22.518 --> 00:04:24.434
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

70
00:04:32.683 --> 00:04:34.800
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

71
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.280
So, let's walk through.

72
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.540
So if it's a root, we need to account for
that, we talked about earlier.

73
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.470
It's probably like three or
six lines of code.

74
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.190
To account for that, otherwise.

75
00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:50.670
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We'll set up,
who the parent is, right?

76
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.090
So if it's not the route, it has a parent.

77
00:04:54.618 --> 00:04:55.580
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And we're passing it.

78
00:04:57.299 --> 00:04:59.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So the first thing
is we wanna check if it's a leaf.

79
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:08.167
If it is, you wanna delete it And so

80
00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:13.643
how we delete that is we

81
00:05:13.643 --> 00:05:20.862
set the PRDN to null, right.

82
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.581
So that would look something
like parent[right] = null.

83
00:05:32.494 --> 00:05:34.300
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does that make sense?

84
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.370
What that means in code.

85
00:05:43.854 --> 00:05:44.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where
this is a string.

86
00:05:47.736 --> 00:05:51.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so
the other case is if it has one known.

87
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.316
We gonna check if it's a left or
right, you know.

88
00:05:56.316 --> 00:05:59.003
This is actually where we're
checking if there's one node.

89
00:05:59.003 --> 00:06:01.970
And then we're just gonna set it.

90
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:07.154
So what that might look like is,

91
00:06:07.154 --> 00:06:15.830
parent ["right"] =
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: One or the other.

92
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.140
So if one of these is evaluating to true,
it's going to save it.

93
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.320
We know that one of them is true and
one of them's false.

94
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.000
And so that should work for
what we're doing here.

95
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.630
Cool, anything else?

96
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.780
Who finished this in the three minutes?

97
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.160
You can raise your hand if you did.

98
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.670
Okay, all right.

99
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.700
You ready for case three?

100
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.650
Awesome.

101
00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.450
Any questions?

102
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What is case three?

103
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:50.330
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What
do you think is case three?

104
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.160
So case one it's a leaf,
case two there's one node.

105
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:56.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I would think two nodes.

106
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.510
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Umhm.

107
00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.260
Yeah, that's our only other option.

108
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.543
Case three is, what if there's aliens?

109
00:07:02.543 --> 00:07:07.433
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's a real thing.

110
00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:07.933
Okay.

111
00:07:09.642 --> 00:07:13.560
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So case three is,
when the node has two children
