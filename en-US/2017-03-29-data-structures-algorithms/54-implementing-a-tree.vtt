00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Took a little
deep dive into link list and

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.800
we're gonna circle back to Tree's.

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.366
All right,
let's take a look at our tree here.

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:13.356
So what is the main difference
between our tree here and

5
00:00:13.356 --> 00:00:18.131
a link list that we are implementing?
&gt;&gt; Male: Each node has two references.

6
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:20.824
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yeah, so instead of just having

7
00:00:20.824 --> 00:00:26.640
one maybe .next, we have multiple,
in this case we have two.

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.867
But trees could be general,
you can have like quad trees, so

9
00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.107
you can have a tree that has no
specified number of children.

10
00:00:33.107 --> 00:00:38.210
So like one can have three, one can
have one, one could have a million.

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.828
You know, probably not super useful,
but that would be like a general tree.

12
00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:50.900
What else?
&gt;&gt; Bianca: What's the same?

13
00:00:53.684 --> 00:00:54.413
&gt;&gt; Male: Yeah,

14
00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:58.612
that is now called the root.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yeah, so

15
00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:01.206
we have a little bit of
different vocabulary.

16
00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:04.773
The root is the same as our head, totally.

17
00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:07.175
What do we call our tail?
&gt;&gt; Male: Leaves.

18
00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:08.181
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Leaves,

19
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:13.330
can have multiple leaves, right?
&gt;&gt; Male: Mm-hm.

20
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.459
&gt;&gt; Bianca: But just one root.

21
00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:24.115
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Cool, anything else?

22
00:01:24.115 --> 00:01:27.252
&gt;&gt; Male: Do nodes hold references to their

23
00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:30.595
parents in the tree?
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Usually not,

24
00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:34.881
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Cool, so

25
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:39.690
one other tidbit about trees is that
it's different than a link list.

26
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.902
A link list can be circular, so a link
list could actually point to itself,

27
00:01:44.902 --> 00:01:47.150
and that would be an okay thing.

28
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.531
Where trees are not allowed
to have a circular loop.

29
00:01:50.531 --> 00:01:54.908
So this, for
example 13 couldn't connect to 12,

30
00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:59.200
that would be an incorrect
implementation of a tree.

31
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.147
Yup, cool.

32
00:02:02.147 --> 00:02:03.840
What else did I want to say about that?

33
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.504
Yeah, so we hold references,
usually from parent to child,

34
00:02:08.504 --> 00:02:15.155
similar to our single link, it's just one
direction, except we have multiple nodes.

35
00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:23.756
And so back to our pseudocode,
&gt;&gt; Bianca: How is our constructor gonna

36
00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:32.149
be different?
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Maybe we

37
00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:37.715
can just copy what we have.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: And

38
00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:45.156
then we can put it here.
&gt;&gt; Male: So

39
00:02:45.156 --> 00:02:49.566
the node, instead of this.next for

40
00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:54.401
a node, you could do this, children and

41
00:02:54.401 --> 00:03:00.130
set up to an empty array?
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yeah, yeah.

42
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.003
So we wanna have a collection of children.

43
00:03:03.003 --> 00:03:07.240
And for a general tree,
it could be an amount of children, right.

44
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.638
We're not creating rules right now,
but think about, if you did need to

45
00:03:11.638 --> 00:03:16.196
create rules with that it tells well,
just in the back of your mind, cool.

46
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.285
&gt;&gt; Bianca: What else will be different?

47
00:03:23.285 --> 00:03:29.428
Would we have a tail, nope.
&gt;&gt; Male: Change

48
00:03:29.428 --> 00:03:31.428
head to root.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yep.

49
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.559
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Great.

50
00:03:44.824 --> 00:03:45.449
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Cool,

51
00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:51.780
maybe want to add a node.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: What's the main

52
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.060
difference here for adding a node?
&gt;&gt; Male: Well, we need more information

53
00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.507
because with the link list tallies, or you
could assume it always goes on the end.

54
00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:03.071
But because we have branches here,
we need to know where it goes.

55
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:03.903
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Mm-hm, yeah.

56
00:04:03.903 --> 00:04:04.464
&gt;&gt; Male: Is that

57
00:04:04.464 --> 00:04:05.700
it?
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Yeah, but

58
00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.669
what about through the case
where we have to loop?

59
00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.709
Link list it took us a second to
figure out what kind of loop, but

60
00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.444
what if we needed to loop through,
we call this traversing

61
00:04:15.444 --> 00:04:20.426
a tree.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: That

62
00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.790
presents a new kind of
complication as well, right.

63
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.655
Cool, awesome, so that's a cliff hanger.

64
00:04:29.655 --> 00:04:34.160
Cuz tomorrow we're gonna be
traversing trees all over the place.

65
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.683
And we're gonna hope into just
creating your tree data structure.

66
00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:43.411
There's some exercises in there as well.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Let's check it

67
00:04:43.411 --> 00:04:49.076
out.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: But the last two,

68
00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:57.260
the searching.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: You can see the note here.

69
00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.625
Hold off on DFS, and BFS,

70
00:04:58.625 --> 00:05:04.214
cuz we haven't covered that yet.
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Unless you know it and

71
00:05:04.214 --> 00:05:05.564
you just want to do it, go for it.

72
00:05:05.564 --> 00:05:09.440
We'll be doing it a few different times
for a few different data structures.

73
00:05:11.928 --> 00:05:14.013
&gt;&gt; Bianca: Cool, are you ready?

74
00:05:14.013 --> 00:05:19.340
So now, armed with our knowledge,
we're going to implement a tree.
