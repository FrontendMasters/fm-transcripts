00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.020
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Here's a solution for

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.190
the implementation of our graph
with an addNode and addEdge.

3
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.710
We are representing our
adjacency list as an object.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.890
This allows us to do constant time
look up on permanent values so

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.910
you can save numbers,
you can save strings and such.

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.150
Here and just look it up

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.880
in real time versus when we were using
our example with an array, right?

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.098
It constrains us to only using numbers,

9
00:00:35.098 --> 00:00:39.930
asterisks, not 100% true but
let's go with that.

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.950
So, object is better,
we have a little more flexibility

11
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.110
there.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great.

12
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.688
So, we are going to, add a node,

13
00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:56.760
we have just a catch here,
it's under final return.

14
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.175
Otherwise, just like we would do in
our pseudo code, we are going to

15
00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:07.389
add,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: A key

16
00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.483
to our object.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

17
00:01:11.483 --> 00:01:18.010
have it equal either itself,
if it exists, or an empty array.

18
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.475
Let's break that down a little bit.

19
00:01:19.475 --> 00:01:26.158
We´re gonna say myGraph = newGraph.

20
00:01:26.158 --> 00:01:29.280
Right, we´re just gonna initialize that.

21
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.472
If we did a console.log,

22
00:01:34.472 --> 00:01:38.272
of our graph right now,

23
00:01:38.272 --> 00:01:43.983
it would look something like this.

24
00:01:43.983 --> 00:01:45.050
Does that surprise anybody?

25
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.990
No?
Okay, good.

26
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:55.483
So, we say myGraph.add,

27
00:01:55.483 --> 00:02:01.305
no, add node and
we're gonna add the node asdf.

28
00:02:01.305 --> 00:02:04.404
Let's use some strengths to mix it up.

29
00:02:04.404 --> 00:02:08.727
I have to see a circle with
a number in it, a line,

30
00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:11.924
again it's gonna make me go crazy.

31
00:02:11.924 --> 00:02:16.189
[LAUGH] I don't know.

32
00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:22.930
Okay, so now what does our
adjacency list look like?

33
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.351
It's gonna look like this.

34
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:32.106
We have asdf, right.

35
00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:34.060
And this is what we are doing
here on line seven.

36
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.782
So we're looking at notes value, right?

37
00:02:36.782 --> 00:02:42.103
We're just doing a look up on the object
and we're saving a value here

38
00:02:42.103 --> 00:02:48.190
which will either be node set value,
right, we do a look up, there is no asdf.

39
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.610
So we're gonna go to the right and we're
gonna initialize it as an empty array.

40
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.310
So we see here we have asdf and then
we just put an empty array right there.

41
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.683
And so that's our adjacency list
with one item in it, no edges.

42
00:03:05.683 --> 00:03:12.620
Okay, so now let's add,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Actually,

43
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.630
who has pets here?

44
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.440
Who loves animals?

45
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.180
Who is capable of making up names for
pets?

46
00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.930
All of us,
I'm glad we have an inclusive game here.

47
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.090
Okay, so
this is gonna be our pet name list.

48
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.640
Some of them are going to be friends, and

49
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.230
we'll just have our
relationships between them.

50
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.720
Instead of add edge,
we can call it make friend.

51
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.629
So every edge we add is when you go to
the dog park and they sniff each other and

52
00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.260
stuff and
then they become lifelong friends.

53
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.440
I think that's the process.

54
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.480
We can pseudocode that one out later,
but anyway, I think you get the picture.

55
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.690
We're gonna add pickle so pickle.

56
00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.140
I think pickles is a better name for
an animal plural.

57
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.370
Okay so we have pickles,
and then who's got a pet?

58
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.928
What's their name?

59
00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:08.567
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Dobby.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Dobby like

60
00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:09.100
from Harry Potter?

61
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.320
Okay and that's a great name.

62
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:21.235
So now our adjacency list
looks like this nodes.

63
00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:29.253
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pickles,

64
00:04:29.253 --> 00:04:32.330
comma, there we go.

65
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.762
Dobby, and
then since Dobby does not exist yet,

66
00:04:36.762 --> 00:04:40.770
we just initialized it, it's just empty.

67
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.350
Who here has a pet named Pickles?

68
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.631
No one, who else here has a pet name,

69
00:04:48.631 --> 00:04:51.560
any pet name?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Gibson.

70
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Gibson, you guys have

71
00:04:54.460 --> 00:05:00.330
good names.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Gibson,

72
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.450
and so now our.

73
00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.131
What could be a social network for
animals like pawbook or

74
00:05:10.131 --> 00:05:13.410
something, I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Pawbook's good.

75
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.392
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pawbook or furbook,

76
00:05:15.392 --> 00:05:18.700
furbook, furbook.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What if they don't have fur?

77
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.776
Well, what if you don't have a face?

78
00:05:24.776 --> 00:05:28.835
[LAUGH] You know?

79
00:05:28.835 --> 00:05:33.870
[LAUGH]
I'm really good at these insult wars.

80
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:34.803
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Really though,

81
00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:37.608
you don't have to have
a face to part of Facebook.

82
00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:44.140
[LAUGH]
I think we're all so tired.

83
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.420
Okay, so here we are.

84
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:53.050
We're adding nodes and
if we were to sort of draw this,

85
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.020
we would just be drawing circles and
space because they're not connected.

86
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.792
Least useful graph ever.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so

87
00:06:01.792 --> 00:06:04.170
that's where the addEdge comes into play.

88
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.990
So here we are.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's add some edges.

89
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.794
So who do you think Pickles,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Makes

90
00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:22.187
friends with first?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Probably Dobby,

91
00:06:22.187 --> 00:06:24.920
Gibson's kinda stand-offish.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

92
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.404
we're at the dog park, or
at the cat park, and Dobby and

93
00:06:30.404 --> 00:06:35.670
Pickles meet, and
they become life-long friends.

94
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.535
Because we don't have
a remove edge in this graph.

95
00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:39.100
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

96
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.860
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So once you become

97
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.070
a friend,
you're always gonna be a friend forever.

98
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.190
So that's okay,
there's something sweet about that.

99
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.210
Okay, I'm gonna move our
picture down as well.

100
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.620
Okay, what does this do?

101
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.030
We're gonna have dobby and pickles.

102
00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.250
We have value1 and value2.

103
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.350
So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If for whatever reason

104
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:08.464
these things don't exist yet,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then we

105
00:07:08.464 --> 00:07:13.740
are gonna say this is invalid,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah?

106
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:19.050
We might even wanna say, hey, why don't
we add the one that doesn't exist yet?

107
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.430
We could maybe initialize it,
I don't know, maybe.

108
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.580
So, this is undirective, so
we're gonna add both of these values

109
00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.590
into the other person's list, okay?

110
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.950
So value one dobby, right?

111
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:43.290
So this is the lookup, and
we're gonna pushing pickles

112
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.640
into dobby's friends list,
okay, for a book.

113
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.170
So who do we, dobby, pickles, okay.

114
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.880
So here we go Pickles is there, and

115
00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.740
then we also do the opposite.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

116
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:11.040
now we know that pickles and
dobby have a connection forever.

117
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:18.820
And what that would look like
In a graph would just be right.

118
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.490
So we just have a connection like that.

119
00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:28.520
All right,
let's make more friends with our pets.

120
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:36.479
Let's see we'll have Gibson

121
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:41.352
will make friends with dobby.

122
00:08:41.352 --> 00:08:44.670
And so, we're gonna add the edge, so

123
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:50.654
we're gonna add dobby to gibson.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

124
00:08:50.654 --> 00:08:55.139
then we're also going
to add gibson to dobby.

125
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.932
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool and now what we

126
00:09:00.932 --> 00:09:07.360
just did is we just added this connection.

127
00:09:13.155 --> 00:09:17.117
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool and now if we

128
00:09:17.117 --> 00:09:24.766
wanted to add pickles, right?

129
00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:29.605
Then we would have to put pickles

130
00:09:29.605 --> 00:09:34.984
inside of Gibson's friend list and

131
00:09:34.984 --> 00:09:40.362
then we'd have to put Gibson inside

132
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:44.860
pickles' friendship list.

133
00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.429
Cool and then that is,
represents this relationship.

134
00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:53.940
Something like that.

135
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.200
So now we have graph though it
really like, friend, yehey.
