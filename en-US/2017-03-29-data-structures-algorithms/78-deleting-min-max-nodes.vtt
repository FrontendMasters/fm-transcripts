1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.420
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So one thing we
haven't done yet is deleting our nodes.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.510
We'll delete the min which is
the same as delete the max.

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.926
And then we'll start back up tomorrow.

4
00:00:12.926 --> 00:00:17.198
Cool.

5
00:00:17.198 --> 00:00:19.234
So this is the binary searchery.

6
00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:23.290
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So this is deleting
the minimum value or the maximum value.

7
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.840
Is that clear?

8
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.570
So our minimum value,
you'd want to delete three.

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.000
Or for the maximum 25.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.199
Pretty straightforward.

11
00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.660
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
let's pseudo code this out.

12
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.320
We have some steps here.

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't really
understand the second step.

14
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Set its right
to the left of the parent.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.920
You have to, if you break the tree,

16
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.670
because you delete a node you have
to glue it back together, right?

17
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.063
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But it's the min,
It doesn't have any children, right?

18
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:09.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Right, but
it's down the minimum on the tree, right?

19
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.170
After you delete the three.

20
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what could we do?

21
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.690
I mean, we could literally
just set this to null, right?

22
00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

23
00:01:15.985 --> 00:01:16.850
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we could just do that.

24
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.410
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

25
00:01:19.864 --> 00:01:21.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
let's start the easy way.

26
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

27
00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:23.948
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You're speaking my language.

28
00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:29.188
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

29
00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:32.982
here, I'll delete this so
it's not as confusing.

30
00:01:37.335 --> 00:01:43.019
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's

31
00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:44.827
the first thing we need to do?

32
00:01:44.827 --> 00:01:48.387
Go left.

33
00:01:48.387 --> 00:01:51.424
So you wanna traverse left, right?

34
00:01:56.018 --> 00:02:00.812
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
if there's left, you wanna traverse,

35
00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:03.882
why do I do that sometimes?

36
00:02:06.393 --> 00:02:07.770
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

37
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.890
If there's a left, traverse left.

38
00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.008
This is for the minimum right,
the minimum's gonna be left left left.

39
00:02:15.008 --> 00:02:16.242
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

40
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:23.341
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then,
what else do we have to think about?

41
00:02:26.176 --> 00:02:30.968
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Once you can't go left
anymore, you wanna delete, right?

42
00:02:38.328 --> 00:02:41.466
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So delete-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That node.

43
00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:53.821
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
how do we delete that node?

44
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:54.443
What would that look like?

45
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.875
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is that
the parents left to null?

46
00:03:11.604 --> 00:03:14.148
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,
what do you think?

47
00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:20.390
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Should we try it?

48
00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You want to set the parents
left to the value of the right.

49
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.890
Is that the right signal?

50
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.050
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't
think we have to do that.

51
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.320
We'll just add to null, and
then it's not there anymore right?

52
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.145
We're deleting the minimum.

53
00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:39.592
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And we're good.

54
00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:45.994
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So let's run it.

55
00:03:50.645 --> 00:03:53.709
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, and let's
look at our tree while we're doing it.

56
00:03:58.063 --> 00:03:58.934
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

57
00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:04.784
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Can you
guys see that tree okay?

58
00:04:10.734 --> 00:04:11.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

59
00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:21.518
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
our first go round, val is 11, right?

60
00:04:21.518 --> 00:04:22.182
True?

61
00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:27.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, cool.

62
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.092
So does 11 have a left?

63
00:04:31.202 --> 00:04:31.702
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: True.

64
00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:34.912
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
then we traverse left.

65
00:04:38.415 --> 00:04:42.864
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
then we skip down.

66
00:04:42.864 --> 00:04:47.287
Our value in question is which one?

67
00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:48.967
Seven.

68
00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:52.727
Seven have a left?

69
00:04:52.727 --> 00:04:56.031
Seven have a left?

70
00:04:56.031 --> 00:04:57.544
True.

71
00:04:57.544 --> 00:05:06.584
Traverse left
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

72
00:05:06.584 --> 00:05:10.675
our value is what?

73
00:05:10.675 --> 00:05:17.718
5, this has a left TRUE.

74
00:05:17.718 --> 00:05:18.431
You're gonna traverse.

75
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:30.218
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
val equals equals equals three, okay?

76
00:05:39.223 --> 00:05:39.928
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does it have a left?

77
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: False.

78
00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:49.855
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we don't traverse left.

79
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.867
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And our next task
is delete that node by setting parents

80
00:05:57.867 --> 00:06:00.490
left node to null.

81
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.362
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So my question is,
are we gonna wreck the whole tree?

82
00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:05.169
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hm?

83
00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Are we about
the wreck the whole tree?

84
00:06:09.447 --> 00:06:11.395
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How do we
stop all of the deletes?

85
00:06:11.395 --> 00:06:15.763
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's going to keep
executing the deletes as it goes back up.

86
00:06:15.763 --> 00:06:18.381
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well, let's explore
what would actually happen before we jump

87
00:06:18.381 --> 00:06:19.112
to conclusions.

88
00:06:21.636 --> 00:06:26.499
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we need to delete
that node by setting the parents left

89
00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:27.330
to null.

90
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So we're on three right now.

91
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.980
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're here.

92
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.620
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We would want.

93
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.471
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We need
five's left to be null.

94
00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:41.551
That would be a way to delete it, right?

95
00:06:49.702 --> 00:06:52.237
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
how do we access five?

96
00:06:52.237 --> 00:06:54.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We're gonna need-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Argument of the function?

97
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hmm?

98
00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: To make it
an argument of the function?

99
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.140
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
you could pass it in every time.

100
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.040
You could always pass
a reference to the parent.

101
00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:08.720
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
how to get a reference to parent.

102
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.070
So that's probably the easiest way.

103
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.020
Pass it in.

104
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.910
So let's just say we have val and

105
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:21.748
then we have this.parent or
something that gets passed in.

106
00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:23.838
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: A question.

107
00:07:23.838 --> 00:07:25.230
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm?

108
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: On the minimum values three,
why you delete five?

109
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.600
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: From the minimum
value, why would we delete five?

110
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Yeah,
if we are going to find minimum,

111
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:37.730
we are deleting the minimum value or
the three?

112
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.472
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, you're
deleting the minimum values of three.

113
00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:48.604
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: So why make, why we change,

114
00:07:48.604 --> 00:07:52.270
make the parent null?

115
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.740
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well, we don't make
the parents null, we make their left.

116
00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:01.320
So 5.left should then be null, so that
it doesn't have a pointer to anything.

117
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.760
And then the three will just be garbage
collecting, that's what we want.

118
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.690
So, let's say we're passing
in a parent every time.

119
00:08:11.782 --> 00:08:13.470
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not really
a lot of overhead there,

120
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.052
that's pretty simple, right?

121
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.598
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so.

122
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:21.890
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great.

123
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.593
So then we would just say like
this.parent.next equals null.

124
00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:33.804
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not left?

125
00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:34.304
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Thank you.

126
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.763
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,
so we deleted it.

127
00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:41.930
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Are we happy?

128
00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.970
So let's see how we return up.

129
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:46.780
So we delete it.

130
00:08:52.508 --> 00:08:59.968
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So you wanna just say
if there is no left or something, right?

131
00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:03.168
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

132
00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:11.589
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH] Otherwise you
would just wreck your whole tree.

133
00:09:11.589 --> 00:09:13.686
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We'll see.

134
00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:15.839
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Which would
be kinda fun to try.

135
00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:19.556
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Trying to get it

136
00:09:19.556 --> 00:09:20.305
not turn yellow.

137
00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:29.650
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
so where were we?

138
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:33.756
So I'll just put this back up here,
all right?

139
00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:42.085
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we exit out of this, right?

140
00:09:42.085 --> 00:09:43.921
So we set it to null, three is gone.

141
00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:49.073
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
then we pop out of this traverse left,

142
00:09:51.227 --> 00:09:53.405
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then we say,

143
00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:56.678
is there a left for five?

144
00:10:00.714 --> 00:10:01.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: No?

145
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.316
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No.

146
00:10:02.316 --> 00:10:05.066
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: [LAUGH]

147
00:10:05.066 --> 00:10:06.250
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So then you're

148
00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.491
gonna delete five, that's a problem right?

149
00:10:10.491 --> 00:10:11.518
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: Yeah.

150
00:10:11.518 --> 00:10:12.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

151
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.056
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We want it to stop

152
00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:20.804
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what can we do to

153
00:10:20.804 --> 00:10:22.390
stop it?

154
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.350
We just want it, once it gets to three,
we want it to delete it and then move on.

155
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:29.320
We don't want it to keep deleting,
that doesn't make sense.

156
00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.840
Cuz then we're just gonna
have a really messed up tree.

157
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.950
Actually, our tree would be totally gone,
it just like.

158
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah that
would be totally gone

159
00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.400
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Forever.

160
00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Could we, when we,
after we, like, it, well.

161
00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:47.537
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Actually,
wouldn't the 15 tree remain?

162
00:10:47.537 --> 00:10:48.138
Sorry.

163
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.562
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you just set a flag or
something?

164
00:10:53.562 --> 00:10:54.980
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You could.

165
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:55.930
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I don't know
if that's a good way to do

166
00:10:55.930 --> 00:11:00.986
it,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What

167
00:11:00.986 --> 00:11:01.605
if we do it first?

168
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:06.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How
does that change the order?

169
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:07.928
Does that fix it for us?

170
00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:14.351
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, it does.

171
00:11:14.351 --> 00:11:15.158
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

172
00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:15.811
Try that.

173
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:18.410
&gt;&gt; Group: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Seems really simple,

174
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:23.152
but I don't think I would
have thought of that.

175
00:11:23.152 --> 00:11:24.170
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH] That's like all it

176
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.230
is with recursion, though.

177
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:27.930
It's like, well I can't do that much but

178
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.265
I can change the order of
the things that I'm executing.

179
00:11:30.265 --> 00:11:36.040
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
so let's try this.

180
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cuz my solution is gonna
be like five lines long or whatever.

181
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:41.164
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

182
00:11:41.164 --> 00:11:44.245
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But
the order you execute changes a lot.

183
00:11:44.245 --> 00:11:45.668
What's happening?

184
00:11:45.668 --> 00:11:51.015
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so, we're here.

185
00:11:51.015 --> 00:11:53.485
This is where we've been
ending at the end every time.

186
00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:56.755
Great.

187
00:11:56.755 --> 00:11:58.915
So we enter in our value is three.

188
00:11:58.915 --> 00:12:01.225
Three doesn't have a left.

189
00:12:01.225 --> 00:12:05.451
You delete the parents, pointer to null.

190
00:12:05.451 --> 00:12:08.220
Form, is there a left?

191
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:11.310
No, so I'll just return, we'll pop out.

192
00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:15.257
This has nothing left in
the function at all, we pop out.

193
00:12:18.145 --> 00:12:20.335
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right,
and we continue popping out.

194
00:12:20.335 --> 00:12:23.008
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Seems useful, right?

195
00:12:25.752 --> 00:12:26.350
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

196
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:33.750
So what about the case where
our minimum has a child?

197
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:37.738
So now we deleted three, but
five is our new minimum.

198
00:12:43.786 --> 00:12:47.873
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we need to account for that.

199
00:12:47.873 --> 00:12:50.977
And I'm gonna end it there,
so sleep on that.

200
00:12:50.977 --> 00:12:52.691
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sleep on that.

201
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:56.937
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

202
00:12:56.937 --> 00:13:00.690
then sleep on what if you're
deleting a random one in the middle,

203
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.479
what might you be able to do, just have it
fresh in your mind and we'll go over some.

204
00:13:14.175 --> 00:13:15.327
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

205
00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:16.327
All right.

206
00:13:16.327 --> 00:13:20.040
Well, see you guys tomorrow at nine-ish.
