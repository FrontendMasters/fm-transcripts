00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.560
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna
to hop into some exercises.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.050
You guys ready to do this on your own?

3
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.630
You have a friend.

4
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.790
You remember how to meet your friends
from yesterday, where you turn and

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.910
you shake their hand, like this.

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.262
If you're online you can use code
share to meet up with someone and

7
00:00:17.262 --> 00:00:19.600
talk about Time complexity.

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.480
Your exercises are gonna
be in the following slides.

9
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.110
So if you just continue,
it says what is the time complexity.

10
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's
the exercises you're gonna do.

11
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.460
It's not in GitHub, okay?

12
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.070
That's important.
