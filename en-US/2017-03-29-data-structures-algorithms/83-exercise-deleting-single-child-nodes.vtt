00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna scaffold
our general remove node methods.

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.310
That's gonna be in our exercise repo.

3
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.070
So if we go to Exercises

4
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.843
here,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're

5
00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:18.580
gonna start with the delete node method.

6
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.069
And we're only gonna count for
the first two cases.

7
00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:25.241
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For general nodes.

8
00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:30.569
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So the difference
here, instead of the min and the max,

9
00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.290
is that you're gonna pass a value.

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.114
You're going to have to search for
that value.

11
00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:40.978
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then, you need
to figure out if it has one children, or

12
00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.461
two children, or no children.

13
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:46.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For the case where
it has two children, we'll just return.

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.564
And we'll stop, and we're gonna,
after our exercise,

15
00:00:49.564 --> 00:00:53.536
we're gonna come back, and
we're gonna explore that next step.

16
00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:56.760
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That make sense?

17
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.382
You ready to go?
Nice little warm-up?

18
00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:01.099
Cool.

19
00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:04.875
And the question that
what should this return.

20
00:01:04.875 --> 00:01:07.357
Dimitri brought up a good point.

21
00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:12.010
If you wanna be able to chain, you could
just return the entire tree at the end.

22
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.939
Or if you want it to have more
like a pop implementation,

23
00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.062
you might wanna delete the node, right?

24
00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:23.380
And you're gonna have to save that and
delete it at the end.
