00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.023
&gt;&gt; Biana Gandolfo: First
exercise in the morning, so

2
00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:03.530
we have our binary search tree.

3
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.720
We're going to create first a binary tree,

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.240
binary search tree, and then you wannna
create an insert and a contains.

5
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.220
So first you're gonna
write the constructor.

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.107
Don't forget the rules left and right,
&gt;&gt; Biana Gandolfo: For

7
00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:31.888
insert,
&gt;&gt; Biana Gandolfo: And

8
00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:33.340
then we're gonna do contains.
