00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.220
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're just
gonna jump into exercises.

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.580
The first thing is,

3
00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.920
if you did not finish your string
exercise, I encourage you to finish that.

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.370
Second thing is, where are the exercises?

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.319
Let me tell you,
they are not there, they are here,

6
00:00:16.319 --> 00:00:21.064
thank you, reload, and
let me just make sure that this

7
00:00:21.064 --> 00:00:25.742
link even works.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nope,

8
00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:26.850
that's not even the right one.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:34.608
We need to go to this one.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Here we are,

10
00:00:34.608 --> 00:00:35.767
we are here.

11
00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:41.990
All right, so we click on this link,
ooh, it's working.

12
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.490
Look at that.

13
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.120
So here are the links to your exercises.

14
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.314
We're gonna do 1 and 2.

15
00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:55.895
Yeah, 3 and 4 are gonna be for
later this afternoon.

16
00:00:57.365 --> 00:00:58.950
So there is some notes here on the bottom.

17
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.646
There's some exercises bundled with these
data structures that you might not be

18
00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.935
able to complete until further study.

19
00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:09.807
So that just know, I have note on which
ones are gonna be unreasonable if you

20
00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:12.380
don't know the specific algorithm.

21
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.859
But everything else should be good to go,
yeah.

22
00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:20.241
So you're gonna implement these data
structures, not using an array,

23
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:26.078
but also not using a string, okay,
because we don't really use a string now.

24
00:01:26.078 --> 00:01:32.090
It's just a thought exercise.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?

25
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.834
So any ideas of what we might
use if we can't use a string,

26
00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:39.786
and we can't use an array?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: An object?

27
00:01:39.786 --> 00:01:42.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Bingo, an object.

28
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.870
That's my only clue, all right?

29
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.497
This is harking back to my Scooby Doo
mystery board game, that's my clue for

30
00:01:49.497 --> 00:01:50.806
you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I'm [INAUDIBLE].

31
00:01:50.806 --> 00:01:53.326
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

32
00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:55.560
You have a question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you repeats that last.

33
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The clue is,

34
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.600
instead of using a string, use an object.

35
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.740
You cannot use an array.

36
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.370
Yeah.
