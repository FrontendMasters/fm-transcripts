00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Question from that channel,
what is performant, or

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.231
more optimized, or better performance?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Performant

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:14.912
means that it runs faster,
so given more data,

4
00:00:14.912 --> 00:00:19.021
it will be able to compute things faster.

5
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:19.890
That's what it means.

6
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.670
So, we'll talk about that
more tomorrow when we talk

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.708
about,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Big annotation and

8
00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:30.070
things like that.

9
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.320
Run time, what makes algorithms fast,
things like that.

10
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.276
How to optimize them to go faster.

11
00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:39.300
So we'll talk more about that.

12
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.121
All right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I have one pending.

13
00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:48.517
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think he was talking about

14
00:00:48.517 --> 00:00:54.330
the wrapper function?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Okay, yes.

15
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.220
The wrapper function,
this is asked by Eric M, I think that's

16
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.970
called a higher order function?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'm pretty sure

17
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.300
a higher order function just means a
function that could be passed or returned.

18
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.417
So you might wanna double check me
on this, but I'm pretty sure it just

19
00:01:10.417 --> 00:01:16.516
means that you can return a function, or
you can pass a function like data, right?

20
00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:18.609
Some languages you can't do that.

21
00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:22.908
In JavaScript we have that and that makes
really cool things happen when we get in

22
00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:27.964
to functional programming type
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Worlds,

23
00:01:27.964 --> 00:01:31.740
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

24
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.259
If you want more vocabulary,

25
00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.789
like the variable,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Here.

26
00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.390
You can call this like a closure variable,
you're using a closure here.

27
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.658
If you're interested in that,

28
00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:47.581
that's all kinda the same.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: I have a really good

29
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:50.710
link I'll paste into the chatroom.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, absolutely.

30
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.242
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: From Eloquent JavaScript.

31
00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:53.460
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

32
00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:55.241
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and

33
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:58.955
then Kyle has a good class on it
as well here on Frontend Masters.

34
00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:05.128
All right, okay, so here we are.

35
00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:11.985
We're once again at the exercises,
how exciting?

36
00:02:11.985 --> 00:02:17.670
So we are going to move on to
number three and number four.

37
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.360
I recommend starting, trying to finish
most of these as much as possible.

38
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.206
The recursion, number four,
some of them are pretty tough, so

39
00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:33.054
just keep that in mind.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But

40
00:02:33.054 --> 00:02:36.950
they're just basically the most
common recursion questions.

41
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.470
It's almost like you
have to memorize them,

42
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.420
cuz these are just the questions
that they ask, and these

43
00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.160
recursion exercises are more based off
my slides, more based on the conceptual,

44
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.400
like how to loop with recursion,
and how it all works together?

45
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.860
That make sense?

46
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.670
So number three should be easier to
approach than number four is basically

47
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.440
what I'm trying to say.

48
00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.110
But number four, also very important
because if you're learning this for

49
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.400
interviews, there you are, but
they are tough, and that's okay
