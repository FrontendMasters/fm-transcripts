WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we're going to pseudo code this out.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.800
We're going to talk about pre-order,
post-order, and

3
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.390
then I'm going to set you free
to work on it on your own.

4
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.820
And then we'll come together,
we'll pseudo-code it out again, and

5
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.520
then we'll go through the solutions.

6
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.940
So first go all the way to the left,

7
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.270
then you wanna do,
what would be the English word for this?

8
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.893
Go all the way to the left,
and then I guess the parent,

9
00:00:34.893 --> 00:00:39.172
then the right, then the parent parent,

10
00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:44.711
something like that?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is this making sense?

11
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:47.570
So we go all the way to the left.
&gt;&gt; Abby: Yeah.

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.695
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then the parent is

13
00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:51.190
five, then the right, and

14
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.710
then the parent parent is seven.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is that clear?

15
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.828
Okay, so those are just our notes, okay.
&gt;&gt; Abby: How do you

16
00:01:03.828 --> 00:01:10.916
get all the way back up and to the left?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see,

17
00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:12.760
we're going to explore that right now.

18
00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.720
So, who here thinks this is recursive?

19
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.157
I do, awesome, cool.

20
00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:27.133
So we'll just call this traverse,

21
00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:32.989
to make it easier.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

22
00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:38.075
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna traverse.

23
00:01:40.018 --> 00:01:41.419
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What do you think our

24
00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:46.993
base case would be,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For-

25
00:01:46.993 --> 00:01:47.747
&gt;&gt; Abby: [INAUDIBLE]

26
00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:48.397
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

27
00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:52.149
&gt;&gt; Abby: There aren't any words

28
00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.296
[INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To

29
00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:59.054
the right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Traverse

30
00:01:59.054 --> 00:02:00.700
when you are a leaf, maybe.

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.690
Maybe, can explore what that's like.

32
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.790
So a leaf is anything that doesn't
have a child on the left or the right.

33
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.364
So, maybe we'll just stop,
cuz we need a return out of our recursion,

34
00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:22.367
and that's how we're gonna jump
backup levels, is once we return,

35
00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:27.486
that's a spoiler.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

36
00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:31.990
maybe our base case it's
a traverse when you're a leaf.

37
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.656
Does anyone have any other suspicions,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Of when we would stop?

38
00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.028
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No, okay,

39
00:02:53.028 --> 00:02:54.330
we could try that one out.

40
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.390
This is how we figure out a solution,
we come up with a hypothesis, and

41
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.150
then we test it.

42
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.757
We're like computer scientists or
something, I don't know, okay.

43
00:03:07.757 --> 00:03:12.080
So, what would be the next
thing that we do?

44
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.690
So we're like, okay,
we have this hypothesis for a base case.

45
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.850
And then maybe there's something where you
have to break down the problem smaller, so

46
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.430
that it reaches closer to the base case,
it's our thing in recursion that we do.

47
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.618
What would be a way to do that?

48
00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:38.992
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]

49
00:03:38.992 --> 00:03:40.061
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

50
00:03:40.061 --> 00:03:45.070
you can break it down by saying this.left.

51
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.440
Then we have this.value, right, which is
the current, then we have this.right.

52
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.390
Those are our main pieces in question, so
ideally, we wanna go left, current, right.

53
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.860
So here we have left, current, right,

54
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.450
that's the order,
recursion's gonna happen.

55
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.725
On which pieces of these
does the recursion happen?

56
00:04:08.725 --> 00:04:10.956
&gt;&gt; Abby: Left.

57
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.966
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What else?

58
00:04:16.966 --> 00:04:18.154
&gt;&gt; Abby: Right.

59
00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:18.939
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

60
00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:29.940
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, and

61
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.833
then we say when there's like no,
this.left or

62
00:04:35.833 --> 00:04:41.727
this.right, maybe return
that would be like,

63
00:04:41.727 --> 00:04:46.200
or and, that would be our base case.

64
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.695
Obviously there's no when in
JavaScript that's just pseudo code.

65
00:04:55.695 --> 00:05:01.581
What do we think?

66
00:05:01.581 --> 00:05:03.610
Should we try it with some numbers and
see what happens?

67
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.033
Okay, here we go.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's the hover.

68
00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:14.878
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

69
00:05:19.557 --> 00:05:21.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: My sneaking suspicion

70
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.404
is it would work either way, but sometimes
it's not worth it with JavaScript,

71
00:05:26.404 --> 00:05:31.420
it's too lenient, okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: There we go, now

72
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.756
can look at our picture at the same time.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

73
00:05:38.742 --> 00:05:39.545
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great,

74
00:05:42.206 --> 00:05:44.242
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So our current is

75
00:05:44.242 --> 00:05:50.957
gonna be 11, so this.val
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is 11,

76
00:05:50.957 --> 00:05:54.390
right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so

77
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.595
we're gonna play that game, that
popcorn game where you get to say what

78
00:05:59.595 --> 00:06:05.122
happens next.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You guys remember that

79
00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:08.130
game that we played, where we went through
and we said this is what happens next?

80
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.530
We pretend where the JavaScript engine,

81
00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.360
or whatever?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yes.

82
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.380
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Get excited about it,

83
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.970
you get to be a JavaScript engine,
just like you always wanted!

84
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.336
Okay, so John, do you wanna go first?
&gt;&gt; John: So

85
00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:39.967
first it's going to check to see
if there's a left or a right,

86
00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:44.854
and since there is, it's going to move on.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

87
00:06:44.854 --> 00:06:49.776
Abbey, you want to go next?
&gt;&gt; Abby: Are we like doing the things, or

88
00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:54.459
do we just?
&gt;&gt; Abby: Or, cuz,

89
00:06:54.459 --> 00:07:00.812
okay.
&gt;&gt; Abby: So it's going, I mean,

90
00:07:00.812 --> 00:07:03.910
it's continuing on in the left one.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

91
00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.750
we're gonna call recursively.
&gt;&gt; Abby: Yeah.

92
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.796
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what is this.left?

93
00:07:07.796 --> 00:07:09.460
&gt;&gt; Abby: This.left is,

94
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.145
if we're starting at 11?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

95
00:07:11.145 --> 00:07:13.140
&gt;&gt; Abby: this.left is seven.

96
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.992
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so, and

97
00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:19.317
maybe I can do this, this is our, remember
that's like where, that's where we stopped

98
00:07:19.317 --> 00:07:28.214
and left off before.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

99
00:07:28.214 --> 00:07:31.897
this.val is what now?
&gt;&gt; Group: Seven.

100
00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:33.229
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

101
00:07:36.631 --> 00:07:37.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Andy?

102
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.813
&gt;&gt; Andy: So now it's seven and the left

103
00:07:42.813 --> 00:07:49.555
and right are not null.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

104
00:07:49.555 --> 00:07:54.226
&gt;&gt; Andy: So we traverse the this.left.

105
00:07:54.226 --> 00:07:55.569
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, and

106
00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:00.338
Miranda you're up.
&gt;&gt; Miranda: So,

107
00:08:00.338 --> 00:08:03.649
now it's 5.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

108
00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:07.678
&gt;&gt; Miranda: And again, we're not null, so

109
00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:13.359
we're going to traverse this.left again.

110
00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:14.153
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,

111
00:08:18.116 --> 00:08:19.008
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so

112
00:08:19.008 --> 00:08:26.218
we're leaving off here somewhere.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

113
00:08:26.218 --> 00:08:30.909
then Jen, what's our current value then?
&gt;&gt; Jen: 3.

114
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then what happens?

115
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.760
&gt;&gt; Jen: That friendly evaluates, yay!

116
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.270
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So it returns, and

117
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:48.000
then what happens when we return?
&gt;&gt; Jen: Pops off.

118
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.920
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pops off the stack,

119
00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.651
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

120
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:58.726
we pop.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then we come here,

121
00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:04.010
and we continue executing.
&gt;&gt; David: And we have a bug, though,

122
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.944
that if 5 is right, sorry.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're going to

123
00:09:08.944 --> 00:09:10.972
get there, you're so good,

124
00:09:10.972 --> 00:09:14.554
we're going to discover it,
no, no, it's okay.

125
00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.762
&gt;&gt; Abby: Are we aggregating anything?

126
00:09:15.762 --> 00:09:17.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You don't need to,

127
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:21.155
we're just going to put
exclamation points at the end, but

128
00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:23.100
I think you're onto it too.

129
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.290
You guys went quick, okay, so
we stopped where we left off.

130
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:30.740
We just returned nothing, right,
so this is undefined, maybe.

131
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.207
And then we go to this.val,
what is this.val in this frame?

132
00:09:38.207 --> 00:09:39.285
&gt;&gt; Abby: Five.

133
00:09:39.285 --> 00:09:39.829
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Five,

134
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:43.731
this is where we wanna put
our exclamation points,

135
00:09:43.731 --> 00:09:45.623
right, probably?
&gt;&gt; Abby: Yeah.

136
00:09:45.623 --> 00:09:46.952
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cuz we did 3, and

137
00:09:46.952 --> 00:09:51.645
then we did 5, so we probably
have some function that does some

138
00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:57.437
transformation.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is that clear?

139
00:09:59.578 --> 00:10:03.783
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then what happens,

140
00:10:03.783 --> 00:10:07.993
David?
&gt;&gt; David: I think I was distracted.

141
00:10:07.993 --> 00:10:08.572
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We just did this.

142
00:10:08.572 --> 00:10:10.482
&gt;&gt; David: We just, okay, so we,

143
00:10:10.482 --> 00:10:12.679
we just returned the 5, so

144
00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:14.585
then we need to-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We just yeah,

145
00:10:14.585 --> 00:10:18.360
we didn't return it.
&gt;&gt; David: Return it, we called, whatever,

146
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.230
all right, we did the five.

147
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.250
So then we need to transverse the right,

148
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:27.614
which is labeled 6.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so

149
00:10:27.614 --> 00:10:32.750
that means we call function again.

150
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.790
Timbit, what's our value?
&gt;&gt; Timbit: Six

151
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:37.370
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Six, yep,

152
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:42.829
then what happens?
&gt;&gt; Timbit: Hit returns,

153
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:45.929
that would be true?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,

154
00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:51.730
returns.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then,

155
00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:54.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: John, what does

156
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.790
it mean when you return?
&gt;&gt; John: You pop

157
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.493
it off.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pop

158
00:10:57.493 --> 00:11:01.687
it off.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And Abby,

159
00:11:01.687 --> 00:11:03.020
what do you think happens after this?

160
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.178
So we just popped this off

161
00:11:11.767 --> 00:11:13.050
&gt;&gt; Abby: You popped off 6?

162
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.092
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so we called

163
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:21.609
this and we popped it off.
&gt;&gt; Abby: So, it's supposed

164
00:11:21.609 --> 00:11:24.300
to go back up to 7 after that, right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mh-hm, but

165
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:25.570
what is actually happening?

166
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.590
Now, why is it supposed to happen?

167
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:30.008
Once you reach the end of a function,

168
00:11:30.008 --> 00:11:33.388
do you know what happens automatically?
&gt;&gt; Abby: It returns

169
00:11:33.388 --> 00:11:35.923
undefined.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mh-hm, so what happens

170
00:11:35.923 --> 00:11:39.236
when you return from a function?
&gt;&gt; Abby: It pops off

171
00:11:39.236 --> 00:11:40.508
the stack.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,

172
00:11:40.508 --> 00:11:45.922
pops off the stack.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

173
00:11:45.922 --> 00:11:50.851
then we'll continue
from where we left off.

174
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:54.370
Andy?
&gt;&gt; Andy: Yes.

175
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.206
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What happens next?

176
00:11:56.206 --> 00:11:57.741
&gt;&gt; Andy: We'll do our function

177
00:11:57.741 --> 00:12:00.510
on this.value, which is 7?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, and

178
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.420
we'll give it some exclamation points.

179
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.530
And then Miranda, what happens next?
&gt;&gt; Miranda: You go right?

180
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.690
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, we go right, and

181
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.000
you can imagine this is gonna
keep drilling down, right?

182
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.440
So let's just keep going.
