1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.065
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So I think our next
question is, so if the current element

2
00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:10.352
in the array is greater than
our pivot point, what do we do?

3
00:00:10.352 --> 00:00:13.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We need to go on
the other side of the pivot point.

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.334
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,
so that's our else, right?

5
00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:20.310
So how do we do that is my next question?

6
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.016
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We need to know the,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do you need to do two swaps?

7
00:00:29.016 --> 00:00:35.416
So the first one is the other element,
minus 1 that's 7, and then 4 in that?

8
00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:39.930
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Say that slower.

9
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.831
What did you say?

10
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:43.941
So the last one, okay?

11
00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:45.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Minus 1.

12
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:46.832
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

13
00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:57.184
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: With 7, yes.

14
00:00:57.184 --> 00:00:58.558
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: With 7, which is what?

15
00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.143
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: i = 1.

16
00:01:04.786 --> 00:01:06.307
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, with.

17
00:01:06.307 --> 00:01:07.541
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: With i.

18
00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:11.316
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: arr(i)?

19
00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:11.909
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

20
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.901
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, cool.

21
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.422
So, we swap that.

22
00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:20.710
So now, 4 is swapped with 7.

23
00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:25.095
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay so
we're partly there,

24
00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:27.881
because we remember that we don't want 4.

25
00:01:33.108 --> 00:01:36.573
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What about the other
thing that you shoved at the end or

26
00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:38.430
the beginning of the array?

27
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.465
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You mean the 5?

28
00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:40.007
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

29
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:41.866
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so
what do we do with the 5?

30
00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:47.923
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It needs to go
where the 7 was, I mean not 7.

31
00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:48.640
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Where the 4 is now.

32
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.220
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where the 4 is now.

33
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.360
Wait, did the 4 go to the front?

34
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.150
So we did swap the 4 to the front.

35
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.940
Why did the 4 go to the front?

36
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.391
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cuz that's, I'm a robot.

37
00:01:59.391 --> 00:02:01.326
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Did
the 4 go to the front, and

38
00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:04.740
then it goes to the,
it goes around in a circle?

39
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.844
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You could do it that way.

40
00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:08.669
There are definitely two swaps happening.

41
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.559
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, okay,
okay, okay, I understand.

42
00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool, so
what's the next swap we have to do.

43
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.760
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if the 4 is
down here and what's at the end?

44
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.086
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 7.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The 7's at the end?

45
00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:26.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Here I'll put
a note of what we have.

46
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.792
So, so far we had [3, 7, ..] whatever.

47
00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:46.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 4, 5, right,
we had some things in between.

48
00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.790
So what we did, the first thing
we did was we looked at it and

49
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.810
something, maybe nothing happened.

50
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.020
Maybe that was a weird thing,
I don't know.

51
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.267
So we're like, okay, it didn't move,
it didn't do anything wrong, but

52
00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:57.997
why is it there?

53
00:02:57.997 --> 00:03:01.633
That was our,
what we came up with for that.

54
00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:06.216
Then we went to the next one, and
that's when we made our l statement.

55
00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:10.679
And we swapped our 7 with our 4.

56
00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:17.000
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The 4
needs to swap with the 5.

57
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.938
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep.

58
00:03:17.938 --> 00:03:24.430
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The picture shows that
we just took 7 to the last of 4 as it is.

59
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.577
And according to the data,
we didn't take 4 to the second line.

60
00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:34.794
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so
now we need to move it to 5, right?

61
00:03:34.794 --> 00:03:41.377
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just to result moving,
if you put 7 in the last place,

62
00:03:41.377 --> 00:03:45.969
just 4 would be in the position of 5.

63
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.048
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You don't need to take

64
00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:53.185
4 to-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you're saying hey,

65
00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:56.156
maybe we don't even have to swap twice.

66
00:03:56.156 --> 00:04:01.741
Maybe we save 4, put 4, then put 5, is
that what you mean, save 4 in a variable?

67
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.040
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For instance 4
is on the position not 10, right?

68
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.365
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
we don't want it there.

69
00:04:06.365 --> 00:04:12.956
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
just if you move 7 to the, yeah.

70
00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:14.717
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 7 like this?

71
00:04:14.717 --> 00:04:18.188
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Move 7 to the last.

72
00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:23.986
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And you can, no,

73
00:04:23.986 --> 00:04:29.027
leave 4 as in the previous position.l
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So the thing is

74
00:04:29.027 --> 00:04:33.465
is that we have to, if we're going to move
4 to the end, we're going to overwrite it.

75
00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:38.858
If we're moving 7 to the end,
we're going to overwrite the 4.

76
00:04:38.858 --> 00:04:43.989
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just 4 take the
position of, if you move 7 to the position

77
00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:49.140
4, 4 takes the position of 5 so
everything is lined up.

78
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.468
The diagram cross like that.

79
00:04:50.468 --> 00:04:56.032
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

80
00:04:56.032 --> 00:05:03.088
what you're saying then is you
want to save 4 in a variable,

81
00:05:06.417 --> 00:05:10.806
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Switch these two.

82
00:05:10.806 --> 00:05:15.410
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We haven't
done anything [INAUDIBLE].

83
00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Then you wanna move five to-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: i, right?

84
00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:25.257
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

85
00:05:28.358 --> 00:05:36.432
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then you're gonna move 4 to whatever.

86
00:05:36.432 --> 00:05:37.419
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 5.

87
00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.516
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, so
what was that array.length- 2?

88
00:05:46.238 --> 00:05:49.196
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Would you
be able to keep track of that?

89
00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:53.174
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes, so
how are you gonna keep track of that?

90
00:05:53.174 --> 00:05:54.332
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We do.

91
00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:56.591
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Easily.

92
00:05:56.591 --> 00:05:57.831
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: If you did like length- i.

93
00:06:00.303 --> 00:06:01.514
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would be a swap.

94
00:06:01.514 --> 00:06:08.844
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep,
well i at this- 1,- i would be,

95
00:06:08.844 --> 00:06:15.335
cuz i is 1, right, at this point.

96
00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:24.520
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well yeah, because as it
goes up it will be going backwards.

97
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.203
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
we want it to go backwards for sure.

98
00:06:27.203 --> 00:06:32.499
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do

99
00:06:32.499 --> 00:06:34.596
we always want the first
swap to be length- 1?

100
00:06:34.596 --> 00:06:36.069
Shouldn't that one be length- i?

101
00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:40.210
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, let's do it.

102
00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would it be simpler to keep
that as it was, and just do it twice?

103
00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.320
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Do what twice?

104
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.940
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The swap,
the one that's length- 1.

105
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.718
The line that you're on there?

106
00:06:54.718 --> 00:06:57.927
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just do this twice?

107
00:06:57.927 --> 00:07:00.243
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, but with- 1 not- i.

108
00:07:00.243 --> 00:07:07.266
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

109
00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:08.397
so there are a few ways of doing this.

110
00:07:08.397 --> 00:07:11.485
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So you can swap this,

111
00:07:11.485 --> 00:07:16.397
with this, well,
if we go back to how we were.

112
00:07:16.397 --> 00:07:24.391
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

113
00:07:24.391 --> 00:07:28.820
you can swap this one with this one,
right,

114
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.264
4 and then 7 and
then you can swap 4 and 5.

115
00:07:33.264 --> 00:07:33.831
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's what I meant.

116
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:34.858
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's what two swaps,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

117
00:07:34.858 --> 00:07:36.366
So you could totally do that.

118
00:07:36.366 --> 00:07:41.851
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool.

119
00:07:41.851 --> 00:07:47.460
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So is this gonna work?

120
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.930
Have we saved the day?

121
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.597
Broken pseudocode,
this is pseudo pseudocode.

122
00:07:54.597 --> 00:07:59.800
Not even real pseudocode pseudocode,
does this work?

123
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.394
Is this gonna do what we need it to do?

124
00:08:04.972 --> 00:08:08.230
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I know,
let's walk through it.

125
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:12.418
So maybe we aren't clear
if this even works.

126
00:08:17.371 --> 00:08:19.450
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right,
that's where we left with that.

127
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:22.543
Do we have opinions on it yet?

128
00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:25.777
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No one has opinions?

129
00:08:27.766 --> 00:08:28.926
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's okay.

130
00:08:32.196 --> 00:08:32.797
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

131
00:08:35.155 --> 00:08:37.737
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we have no opinions on that.

132
00:08:37.737 --> 00:08:38.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What was the question?

133
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:43.580
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
the question is, does this work?

134
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:48.230
If we turn this pseudocode into real code,
is this our solution?

135
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.570
If I just said okay,
see you guys later, go code this now.

136
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:55.722
Would you guys feel confident
to turn this into a real code

137
00:08:55.722 --> 00:08:57.893
that partitions correctly?

138
00:08:57.893 --> 00:09:00.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just the partition part,
not the, because we.

139
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.967
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
this is just the partition part.

140
00:09:01.967 --> 00:09:09.233
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,
this is just the partition part.

141
00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:10.666
Yeah, for

142
00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:17.310
this the partition,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Isn't

143
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.850
gonna do the slicing part.

144
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:23.470
It is the slicing part, but
it doesn't do it actively.

145
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:27.740
If you see the Quick Sort code,
it sorts it.

146
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.200
It makes a sub array in here,
but we'll get to that.
