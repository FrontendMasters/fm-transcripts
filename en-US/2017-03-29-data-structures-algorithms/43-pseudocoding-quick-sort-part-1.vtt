00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
here's our Pseudocode for the partition.

2
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.980
So we have the list.

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.950
We have a low, right?

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.810
And we have the high.

5
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.290
So we wanna choose the last
element as the pivot.

6
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.820
Then we wanna keep track of the pivot
location, which is initialized as low.

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.340
Okay, which is initialized as
the very first one, which is low.

8
00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.940
And then you're gonna
loop from low to high.

9
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.520
Which is from zero to array dot length.

10
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:38.073
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And if,
the current element is less than or

11
00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:42.300
equal to the pivot you're gonna swap it.

12
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.610
You're gonna swap
the pivot location in I and

13
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.590
then you're gonna increment
the pivot location.

14
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.960
Does that make sense?

15
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.520
Let me think about that.

16
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.709
So if I is less than the pivot,
swap the pivot.

17
00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:07.658
We wanna swap the pivot.

18
00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.752
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There are two
swaps in the other drawing.

19
00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:15.720
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

20
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.090
this is just a partition.

21
00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:21.304
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or
are we missing something?

22
00:01:21.304 --> 00:01:25.374
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You just move the pivot.

23
00:01:25.374 --> 00:01:26.103
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see.

24
00:01:26.103 --> 00:01:31.130
Choose last element as the pivot,
so this is our form, remember?

25
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.028
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm hm.

26
00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:36.191
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This is gonna be zero.

27
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:42.170
Array at zero, remember this one was,
what was it at first?

28
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.640
It was 3, remember that?

29
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.620
If 3 is less than or equal to the pivot,
swap pivot location in i.

30
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.700
So pivot location was the length.

31
00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:00.365
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then i was 0.

32
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.270
Okay, increment pivot location to 1.

33
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.330
That's not quite landing with me.

34
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is that right?

35
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.900
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Doesn't
appear to be right.

36
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.290
So what's wrong?

37
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.870
What's broken?

38
00:02:20.715 --> 00:02:23.010
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what do we say?

39
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.468
We chose the last element as a pivot,
which we can think of as our array.

40
00:02:31.444 --> 00:02:35.690
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let me
make this more readable.

41
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.071
Make it big, look at that.

42
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:42.072
Yeah.

43
00:02:45.483 --> 00:02:48.129
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, all right.

44
00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:52.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

45
00:02:55.457 --> 00:02:57.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so we're
gonna choose the last element as pivot.

46
00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.050
So what was that?

47
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.773
Like our array.

48
00:03:06.193 --> 00:03:09.900
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
which was 4 in our example.

49
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.880
You guys remember the numbers?

50
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.362
So we're gonna keep track of the index for
the pivot location which we're gonna start

51
00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:22.130
at 0
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 0.

52
00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:24.643
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cuz we
start at the beginning.

53
00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:32.980
So for I,
we're gonna loop from 0 to array.length.

54
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.745
If array at i, so
first one is 3, is less than or

55
00:03:38.745 --> 00:03:42.795
equal to the pivot, which is 4.

56
00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:43.840
It's gonna be true, right?

57
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.755
We swap the pivot location and i.

58
00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:51.730
Hm, what does that do?

59
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Aren't
they both zero right now?

60
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.770
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Wouldn't it move the four,
wait, what is i?

61
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Pivot location zero,
I assumed i started at zero.

62
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.

63
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So nothing.

64
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.465
Zero and zero doesn't do anything.

65
00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:12.033
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nothing happens.

66
00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:16.417
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Then you increment.

67
00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:18.320
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pivot location?

68
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And that would be one and
then y would be one.

69
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.011
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
nothing will happen every time.

70
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:24.110
Nothing will happen every time.

71
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
pivot location is one.

72
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.524
I is 1, so if array at i,

73
00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:36.455
which is 1, which is now 7, right?

74
00:04:36.455 --> 00:04:38.820
The next one was 7, is less than or

75
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.722
equal to 4,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then what?

76
00:04:44.722 --> 00:04:46.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,
it's not gonna enter the condition.

77
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.290
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

78
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.200
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Still nothing happens,
but for a different reason.

79
00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.229
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

80
00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:54.930
So, what blanks do we need to fill here?

81
00:05:02.003 --> 00:05:03.990
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're
not moving correctly.

82
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.949
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
what do we need to do?

83
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.030
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The four needs to be
moving over a space every time, right?

84
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.820
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The four only needs
to move when something is greater.

85
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.570
When something is greater.

86
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.544
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does this
need an else statement?

87
00:05:18.544 --> 00:05:23.212
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
let's plop an else in there.

88
00:05:23.212 --> 00:05:24.207
Come on.

89
00:05:28.593 --> 00:05:30.363
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Else what?

90
00:05:30.363 --> 00:05:34.859
Well my spacing is weird.

91
00:05:40.885 --> 00:05:43.652
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think the issue is
pivot location should have started at

92
00:05:43.652 --> 00:05:44.510
the other end.

93
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.556
I don't see the point of
keeping an i variable and

94
00:05:47.556 --> 00:05:51.950
a pivot location that are the same,
that are in sync, because every.

95
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:52.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're
not going to be in sync.

96
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.850
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They won't always be
in sync if you go into that else.

97
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It depends on
what condition is executed.

98
00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:05.910
Why do you start the pivot location
on the opposite side of the array?

99
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.921
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So in this case you can take

100
00:06:08.921 --> 00:06:14.130
the one array length minus one,
swap with seven.

101
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.882
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
far we're kind of saying,

102
00:06:15.882 --> 00:06:20.830
maybe this situation right here is doing
something that maybe isn't important.

103
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.910
Maybe, but we don't know.
