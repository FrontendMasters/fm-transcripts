1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
let's look at this pattern.

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.250
Can someone identify the pattern for me?

3
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.880
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's an act,
then left then right.

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or self act,

5
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.750
then left then right.

6
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
let's test it out.

7
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.470
So self 11, then we go left to 7.

8
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.420
Once we're on 7, the column on self and
then we go to five to the left, right?

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:31.250
Self, three, self and return and
relief, and then we go back up.

10
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.816
We already called on self, so
then the next one is right.

11
00:00:33.816 --> 00:00:38.640
So self, left, right.

12
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.570
And you might notice that it's easiest
to kind of see that in this leftmost.

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.790
Little subtree, so we have self,
left, and then right.

14
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.400
And because it works on one little subtree
it's gonna work on the bigger subtree.

15
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.290
And the big momma subtree of all
subtrees or the entire tree actually.

16
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.590
Unless it's a subtree, cuz I don't
know where this arrow is coming from.

17
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.580
That's pre-order, so
when we set the order for

18
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.470
post order it was left self right.

19
00:01:13.652 --> 00:01:15.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In order.

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.750
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sorry,
in order left self right.

21
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.300
Okay, in our code kinda looks like that,
in our pseudocode.

22
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.058
Let's see if I still have it.

23
00:01:25.058 --> 00:01:30.824
Left, self,

24
00:01:30.824 --> 00:01:34.200
right.

25
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.300
So pre order,
let's try to pseudocode out our pre order.

26
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.163
I'll put it over here
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

27
00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:49.311
those are post-order, but
we'll leave it up there for reference.

28
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:53.590
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

29
00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:57.895
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what's the pattern?

30
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:02.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For pre-order?

31
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, Self.

32
00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.980
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Self
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Left.

33
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Left.

34
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.240
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

35
00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:08.909
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

36
00:02:12.381 --> 00:02:14.128
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
how in this pattern up here,

37
00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:19.475
let's do,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Left, Self, Right.

38
00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:26.873
So this is in order,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

39
00:02:26.873 --> 00:02:29.490
then we have our Pre-Order.

40
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.760
Smiley face just cuz why not.

41
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.280
It's 3 o'clock on a Thursday.

42
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.690
Smiley o'clock somewhere.

43
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.093
Okay, Self, Left, Right.

44
00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:43.776
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Can anyone guess?

45
00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:44.944
We have a pattern up here.

46
00:02:47.352 --> 00:02:48.489
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How
do we apply the pattern?

47
00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:53.385
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You mean for post, or for

48
00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:56.830
just pseudocode in this one?

49
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.468
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For a pre-order.

50
00:02:58.468 --> 00:03:03.680
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: For pre-order, it would just
be you would use your function first.

51
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.300
And then you would traverse left and
traverse right?

52
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.560
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, exactly.

53
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.126
So here we have go left,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

54
00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:15.037
then we, this is Self, right?

55
00:03:15.037 --> 00:03:18.743
And you can almost just copy and
paste this over.

56
00:03:22.893 --> 00:03:24.569
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we need to start with Self.

57
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.420
Then we go left.

58
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.022
And then we wanna

59
00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:43.979
go right.

60
00:03:46.775 --> 00:03:48.044
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does
anyone not believe me?

61
00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:54.418
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sometimes there's
disbelievers in the world, and

62
00:03:54.418 --> 00:03:55.209
I accept all faiths.

63
00:03:57.402 --> 00:03:59.121
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But
you can join my cult any day.

64
00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:02.690
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just kidding,
I would never do that.

65
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.890
Okay, or would I?

66
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.390
I don't know.

67
00:04:07.875 --> 00:04:10.491
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know,
I'll let you guys, let that percolate.

68
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.027
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Do you guys wanna do

69
00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:21.510
the thing that we do?

70
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.710
Our stack thing?

71
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.460
Or are we good?

72
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.620
Stack thing, or are we good?

73
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Good.
I'm good.

74
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.050
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Good?
Everyone's good?

75
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Two thumbs.

76
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Two
thumbs if you're good.

77
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.840
MIddle thumb if you want
me to do the stack thing.

78
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.450
Middle thumbs?

79
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.530
Okay, we'll do it quick.

80
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.170
Okay, so we have the value Starts at 11.

81
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.700
Let's start at 5 just to make it small.

82
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.550
So our value is 5.

83
00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.220
We enter into this function.

84
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.530
The first thing we do is call in on 5.

85
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.390
We have our happy //5!!!

86
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.680
Then, we traverse on left.

87
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.490
So this is saying if there's a left.

88
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.300
This is coming up a lot.

89
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.950
You can totally do this and it's fine.

90
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.070
It does the same thing
as far as I'm concerned.

91
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.040
So if this is true,
then you are going to traverse left.

92
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.980
So when we traverse that's a recursive
call, we're gonna Stop here.

93
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.371
And we're going to put

94
00:05:25.371 --> 00:05:30.954
our
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Function here.

95
00:05:30.954 --> 00:05:37.534
So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We

96
00:05:37.534 --> 00:05:38.727
just called this.left.

97
00:05:38.727 --> 00:05:40.220
What is this.left?

98
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.673
Timbe, do you know?

99
00:05:41.673 --> 00:05:47.010
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 3, absolutely.

100
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.810
So the value here in our
next call is gonna be 3.

101
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.480
So then we call the function.

102
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.040
So now we have a super-happy 3,
all the smileys.

103
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.920
And then, is there a left?

104
00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.720
Nope.

105
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.810
Is there a right?

106
00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:08.010
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: From three.

107
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does three have

108
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:09.500
a this.right?

109
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.690
Nope.

110
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.380
So then we do what?

111
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:17.345
When come to end of function or
return we, we should all say together.

112
00:06:19.691 --> 00:06:20.822
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pop it off the stack,
yeah.

113
00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:25.152
I know it's late in the afternoon.

114
00:06:27.983 --> 00:06:29.750
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Tough
lives we have here.

115
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.980
Cool.
So we popped it off the stack.

116
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.310
We come where we left off.

117
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.100
So we left off there.

118
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.840
And again, we're back at five
cuz we've popped out the stack.

119
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.170
We're in the next level above.

120
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.730
The very next line of code we say,
is there a right?

121
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.040
Does five have a right?

122
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.350
Yes.

123
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.290
So let's traverse there.

124
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.590
And the value is six, right?

125
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.386
And then we do the thing
Here's a thing that we do.

126
00:07:02.347 --> 00:07:06.010
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So our value is 6,
put some exclamation points.

127
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.100
Does 6 have a left?

128
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.490
Nope, does 6 have a right?

129
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.990
Nope.

130
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.980
We come to the end and then we just
return the heck out of there, right?

131
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:16.381
Out of there, out of there, out of there.

132
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.148
And now, we left off here, remember?

133
00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.349
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're done,
and we pop off this stack.

134
00:07:29.385 --> 00:07:33.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To the next level,
what's the next level?

135
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.660
Seven.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Seven.

136
00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.550
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Seven, exactly,
and then we would go to sevens right.

137
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.460
Straight from there.

138
00:07:48.391 --> 00:07:49.151
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

139
00:07:53.353 --> 00:07:54.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Do we get it?

140
00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:55.310
Great.

141
00:07:57.308 --> 00:08:04.110
So that's pre-order, self,
left, right, self, left, right.

142
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:09.300
Again we can pick here to
kind of get a more and

143
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.890
easier to understand perspective,
self, left, right?

144
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.880
You do a dance with it too,
that's some hip so it makes you remember
