00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.818
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So Queues,
pretty similar stacks except kind of like

2
00:00:04.818 --> 00:00:09.276
the name suggest,
is kind of like a queue or a line.

3
00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:12.333
People are talking about Ideli a lot when
they talk about this for whatever reason.

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.560
Everyone's like a queue is like a line for
the deli.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.170
You know, the first person in line is
the first person to get their sandwich.

6
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.644
We call this FIFO.

7
00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:25.409
I don't like these abbreviations,
but you'll see them a lot.

8
00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.193
LIFO, LEFO, FIFO.

9
00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:34.030
LIFO is last in, first out and
FIFO is first in first out.

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.117
So, they, like, super confused me.

11
00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:39.111
So I even just avoid even saying them,
but I have them here for

12
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:41.240
your reference because you'll see them.

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.904
So when we add an item into our queue,
we call it enqueuing.

14
00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:49.145
We take them off and call it dequeuing.

15
00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.850
You'll see, push, pop, enqueue,
dequeue, things like these.

16
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.483
They'll be called different
names in different languages.

17
00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:57.273
But in general,
we'll call them this in this class.

18
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.242
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so
here, is our little line, so

19
00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:03.641
we're gonna go myQueue.enque(1).

20
00:01:03.641 --> 00:01:08.659
We're gonna add that value, so
you have a little man, he has a one.

21
00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.412
And then two,
this person becomes behind that person.

22
00:01:13.412 --> 00:01:14.733
We just dequeued them.

23
00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:20.277
So we just put a red, so they're gone.

24
00:01:20.277 --> 00:01:23.905
So we're gonna enque,
enque and then deque, yeah?

25
00:01:23.905 --> 00:01:28.149
One more time for good measure,

26
00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.659
enque one, enque, deque, one is gone.

27
00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.130
Enque, enque Deque, two is gone.

28
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.194
So whenever we take anything off,
you can only take from the front.

29
00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:44.781
And when you put anything on,
you can only put it on the back.

30
00:01:47.428 --> 00:01:50.396
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, we're good?

31
00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:53.322
Okay, awesome, here's our diagram.

32
00:01:53.322 --> 00:01:57.745
I don't know if you guys remember a time
when these pop-up windows didn't have

33
00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.464
a little checkbox,
say prevent more pop-ups.

34
00:02:00.464 --> 00:02:04.106
Then you'd get trolled into these stupid
websites where you're just like in this

35
00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:04.799
pop-up hell.

36
00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.540
You know what I'm talking about?

37
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.300
So, the underlying data
structure of that is a queue.

38
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.832
And you can see, this is a pop-up handler
queue as pop-ups rain Javascript,

39
00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.455
you just say alert, alert, alert, right?

40
00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.271
Loop times one bajlion.

41
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:20.641
At least that's what it feels like.

42
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:23.867
You enqueue on the back,
and you pop from the top.

43
00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.500
So as you hit OK,
it's gonna take off the front.

44
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.021
Okay, okay, okay, so
that is our queue in action, yeah?

45
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.167
People remember that, right?

46
00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:37.379
Okay, good, cool.

47
00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.420
So that's our queue.

48
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.519
What's our interface?

49
00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.710
We have our storage.

50
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.597
We enqueue, dequeue, we can also do size.

51
00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:50.780
Also lots of methods
where I can go on this.

52
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.219
But these are just the standard ones.

53
00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.849
So whatever you wanna do with your queue.

54
00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.652
Like maybe you wanna make it sparkly.

55
00:02:56.652 --> 00:02:58.169
Maybe you wanna make it dance.

56
00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.770
Whatever it is,
you can do it to your queue.

57
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.672
Just a rule of a queue is that
the enqueue and the dequeue,

58
00:03:04.672 --> 00:03:07.451
that's a core definition of the queue.

59
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:09.583
Whatever else you're gonna do with it,
great.

60
00:03:09.583 --> 00:03:15.689
As we are queue make things,
you know, I don't know, who knows?

61
00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.300
You are the master of your queue and
your stacks and everything else, great.

62
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.743
So this is our interface [COUGH].

63
00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:26.096
I'm not gonna make you do any string,
don't worry.

64
00:03:26.096 --> 00:03:28.090
And I'm not gonna pseudo code it for
you yet.
