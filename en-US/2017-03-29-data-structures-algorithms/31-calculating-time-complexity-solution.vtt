00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.286
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What is the time
complexity of this guy or gal, or neither?

2
00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:10.211
Anyone, anyone get to this one?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I thought this one was

3
00:00:10.211 --> 00:00:13.849
linear cuz it's the single.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's constant.

4
00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:14.864
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It has an increment within

5
00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:15.972
it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

6
00:00:15.972 --> 00:00:21.500
if we just broke it down,
this one's constant, right?

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.659
The loop is goinna be linear,
[SOUND] And here, constant.

8
00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.939
Constant, right?

9
00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.280
We don't really care about the constants.

10
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.820
We just throw them away.

11
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.044
So the end of the day,

12
00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:42.672
we're going to call this linear
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

13
00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:47.846
the fact that we're calling this
function twice means nothing

14
00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:53.277
to our big o notation.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Questions,

15
00:00:53.277 --> 00:00:57.616
comments?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Big surprises from

16
00:00:57.616 --> 00:01:01.555
this, no, okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

17
00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.451
this is an interesting question, right?

18
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.460
Because we have to know how
string dot length works.

19
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.368
Does anyone know how
string dot length works?

20
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.523
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] How does it

21
00:01:15.523 --> 00:01:17.436
work?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We googled it,

22
00:01:17.436 --> 00:01:22.176
cuz to try see how it worked, and it
seems like strings are so it just stores

23
00:01:22.176 --> 00:01:24.701
the length Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

24
00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:28.354
the trick here is that,
that length is not a function.

25
00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.836
It is just a property lookup.

26
00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:33.863
And all property lookup on objects.

27
00:01:33.863 --> 00:01:37.018
And secretly,
everything is an object in JavaScript.

28
00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:42.216
So anytime you see this dot, and you are
not calling it, it's a property lookup and

29
00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:45.839
it's going to be a constant time.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: It doesn't have the so

30
00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.625
it's not evoking a function.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, exactly,

31
00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:52.249
so if your'e envoking it
maybe you are popping.

32
00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:55.441
So if you have an array in here, [SOUND].

33
00:01:55.441 --> 00:02:01.716
And we did an array dot push, this is
still gonna be a constant time operation.

34
00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:02.995
We are still envoking it.

35
00:02:02.995 --> 00:02:07.370
When we envoke it, actually it's still
a constant, so it doesn't matter.

36
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.085
Let me do a better example, for unshift,

37
00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:13.507
we were talking about how
unshift is linear before.

38
00:02:13.507 --> 00:02:18.910
If we don't call it, this operation is
just a property lookup and it's constant.

39
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.019
When we call it, suddenly now it's linear.

40
00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.180
So the details do matter here.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: They matter but

41
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.192
we're also estimating.

42
00:02:27.192 --> 00:02:30.671
Cool, so str.length,

43
00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:35.980
property to look up, constant time.

44
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.087
We're good to go.

45
00:02:37.087 --> 00:02:42.775
We're good to go?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome.

46
00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:43.435
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

47
00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:44.865
we already talked about this.

48
00:02:44.865 --> 00:02:51.351
Push is what?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Constant.

49
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.975
What about unshift?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Linear.

50
00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.760
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Linear, o of n,

51
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.630
all right
