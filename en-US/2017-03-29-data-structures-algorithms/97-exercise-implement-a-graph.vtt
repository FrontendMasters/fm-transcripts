00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.420
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Exercise time.

2
00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.909
We are going to implement a graph,
so let's go into this really quick,

3
00:00:05.909 --> 00:00:07.435
and I'll tell you which ones.

4
00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:10.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So let's see.

5
00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:18.797
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Blah, blah, blah.

6
00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:24.739
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's do addNode.

7
00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:31.177
Let's do addNode, contains, and addEdge.

8
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.554
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So do everything
except for removals and traversing.

9
00:00:43.563 --> 00:00:48.270
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we want to check
for edges, addEdges, and no looping.

10
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.490
So no for each.

11
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.950
So hasEdge, addEdge, contains, addNode.

12
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.370
Does that make sense?

13
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.620
No traversing, no removal.
