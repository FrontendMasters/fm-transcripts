WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.118
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Should we try this
out? Should we do our stack trace thing

2
00:00:02.118 --> 00:00:02.680
that we do?

3
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.264
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Come on.

4
00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:20.095
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

5
00:00:20.095 --> 00:00:24.580
and just should have this
automatically be JavaScript.

6
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.407
Okay, this is all of our pseudocode.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All

7
00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:35.317
right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Actually we can

8
00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:37.880
have it all, we'll undo, never mind.

9
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.620
Here we go.

10
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.570
Are you ready?

11
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.828
So let's just say that we're gonna say,
we're gonna call it BST and

12
00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:51.130
we're gonna pass it,
this is our constructor.

13
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.710
We'll just pass it 11, okay?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

14
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.330
then we're gonna say BST.insert

15
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.058
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This is
kind of like some quick and

16
00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:13.750
dirty sort of pseudo code,
if that makes any sense to you.

17
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.463
So we can insert 15.

18
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.265
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We can say insert 7.

19
00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:29.626
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

20
00:01:29.626 --> 00:01:31.741
we're doing some inserts and

21
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:36.150
we're gonna trace this through and
see what happens, okay?

22
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.906
So the first one is our constructor.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Maybe

23
00:01:41.906 --> 00:01:45.450
we'll have two next to each other.

24
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:55.775
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

25
00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:59.917
we're gonna have our constructor, right?

26
00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:04.843
So we have our value, is what?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 11,

27
00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:10.480
yeah, then we have left which

28
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:17.020
is probably null, right, null.

29
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.830
Yeah, cool.

30
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.650
So now we're gonna insert 15.

31
00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.608
What we want it to look like,
you want it to

32
00:02:25.608 --> 00:02:30.283
look like this.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, and you

33
00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:34.390
know that this is gonna be a full object,
but I'm just shorthanding it there.

34
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.270
It's gonna be full object with a left and
a right.

35
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.405
Cool, so here we go.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So in our insert,

36
00:02:45.405 --> 00:02:51.009
we're calling insert, our value is 15,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

37
00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:53.200
our current is what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 11.

38
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.900
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 11.

39
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.500
So maybe that's something

40
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.000
right, that we need.

41
00:03:01.177 --> 00:03:06.045
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or

42
00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:06.640
maybe it's the stop-value.

43
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.970
You need to access your current somehow.

44
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.080
You get to choose how to do that.

45
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.294
So we'll start out at 11.

46
00:03:13.294 --> 00:03:16.230
So is it less than 11?

47
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.110
No.

48
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.340
So we skip this.

49
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.300
Is it greater?

50
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.595
Yes.

51
00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:28.390
Is there a right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No,

52
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:29.670
not yet.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not yet, so

53
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.540
we're gonna insert.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What does that mean,

54
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.472
exactly?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Create

55
00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:45.313
a new tree with the value of,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Whatever it was,

56
00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:47.007
15 in this case.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

57
00:03:47.007 --> 00:03:49.643
then what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

58
00:03:49.643 --> 00:03:52.623
then return that tree.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Return it?

59
00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:54.003
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

60
00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:02.346
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone have thoughts

61
00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:05.995
on this?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When said new tree with

62
00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:11.620
value to the right side.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

63
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.656
we want to add it to the right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

64
00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:19.561
we probably wanna return it eventually,

65
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:24.614
but-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Normally

66
00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:25.920
indentation is messed up.

67
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.380
It's driving me crazy.

68
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.490
So we're gonna insert it, and
we're gonna add it to the right.

69
00:04:33.628 --> 00:04:37.103
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Current's right.

70
00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:40.938
Cool, so depending on how
you're referencing current,

71
00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:43.320
it's gonna be something.right.

72
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.140
Cool, maybe return.

73
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.644
Great.

74
00:04:45.644 --> 00:04:47.260
So that worked.

75
00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.990
Good job.
Our pseudo code is up to snuff.

76
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.576
That's good news.

77
00:04:54.576 --> 00:04:57.540
So here is our tree you wanna insert 7.

78
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.540
Where do we want this to go?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's gonna go to

79
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.321
the left.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

80
00:05:04.321 --> 00:05:09.575
we're gonna put it here, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah the top level

81
00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:15.194
left.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

82
00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:19.740
and again, this is short hand,
this is gonna be a full tree.

83
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.285
So let's check it out.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So this returns,

84
00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:31.080
we pop it off, we're done.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

85
00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.770
our value is what?

86
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.020
7?

87
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.530
Is it less than 11 which is our current?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

88
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.029
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, so

89
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:45.400
is there a left?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: No.

90
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.470
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nope.

91
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.780
So we're gonna insert.

92
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.971
We already talked about insert.

93
00:05:49.971 --> 00:05:51.402
We need to create a new tree and

94
00:05:51.402 --> 00:05:56.498
we need to add it to the current right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, or left.

95
00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:58.144
Yeah.

96
00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:06.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great, so we did that.

97
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.854
Success.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So now let's try this

98
00:06:10.854 --> 00:06:16.208
one.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where should

99
00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:23.338
the 5 go?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: it

100
00:06:23.338 --> 00:06:28.467
will go to the left on the left again.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To the left of 7,

101
00:06:28.467 --> 00:06:32.457
right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Left of 7.

102
00:06:32.457 --> 00:06:34.074
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

103
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.810
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: My short hand

104
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.699
making sense.

105
00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:42.890
Yeah, I'll just type it out why not?

106
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:48.240
So here is 7, it has a left,
it does not have a right.

107
00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.410
All right, so right is null.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great.

108
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.600
All right, so let's see how that works.

109
00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:01.550
5, so is five 5 less than 11?

110
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.103
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

111
00:07:03.103 --> 00:07:07.918
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does 11 have

112
00:07:07.918 --> 00:07:13.100
a left?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.

113
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.520
Yes.
So then it says here, go left.

114
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.840
What does that mean, exactly?

115
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.093
How do we make it go left?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have to change,

116
00:07:25.093 --> 00:07:30.780
[COUGH] you have to make the current.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This.left- Yeah.

117
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:38.315
What he said, that's okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: This.left.insert

118
00:07:38.315 --> 00:07:40.063
the value.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

119
00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:40.756
this is a recursive call.

120
00:07:40.756 --> 00:07:49.120
Next one.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah?

121
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.502
So this.left, so this is our current,

122
00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:57.767
right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right, so we can just

123
00:07:57.767 --> 00:08:03.977
know that anything to the left of this dot
is gonna be this in that function call,

124
00:08:03.977 --> 00:08:09.490
so this.left.insert what?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The value.

125
00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:11.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The value, right,

126
00:08:11.472 --> 00:08:14.770
which is 5.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So then-

127
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.480
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The recursive side.

128
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.800
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Oops,

129
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.101
what is the value, 5?

130
00:08:32.101 --> 00:08:38.621
And what is current?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: 7,

131
00:08:38.621 --> 00:08:39.851
maybe?

132
00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:41.330
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 7.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay.

133
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.094
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, what's

134
00:08:42.094 --> 00:08:45.011
your question?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I think it clarifies here

135
00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:46.363
now.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, so

136
00:08:46.363 --> 00:08:50.208
what we did is so we are gonna go
left which is once we are at 7.

137
00:08:50.208 --> 00:08:53.934
So we're here, we are at 11 really and

138
00:08:53.934 --> 00:08:57.890
then we check left,
we say is there a left?

139
00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.820
Yes.

140
00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.350
If there is a left,
we wanna go to the next left.

141
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.320
And so we just recursively
call the function again.

142
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:12.430
And we say this.insert on this node, left.

143
00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:19.640
So now this-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is 7.

144
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.949
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Because- So that shifted 7,

145
00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:24.170
right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

146
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:28.170
this is going to be the 7 node.

147
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.815
The reason,
we need to think about whatever, so

148
00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:33.920
the key word this is to find
whenever you call a function.

149
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.970
So before you call
a function there's no value.

150
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.223
And one of the ways to define it is by
whatever this statement evaluates to and

151
00:09:42.223 --> 00:09:46.733
we just call it whatever is
left of the dot at call time.

152
00:09:46.733 --> 00:09:48.220
That's how we say it at Hackreactor.

153
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.789
So whatever this evaluates to,

154
00:09:52.789 --> 00:09:57.562
which this.left here when
this is talking to 11,

155
00:09:57.562 --> 00:10:03.970
talking about 11 is gonna be 7,
the 7 node, it's a node, right?

156
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:09.982
So this is-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This left,

157
00:10:09.982 --> 00:10:12.048
etc.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now,

158
00:10:12.048 --> 00:10:15.220
we're inserting there.

159
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.036
So, that's the equivalent.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And that's

160
00:10:21.036 --> 00:10:25.620
how we're drilling deep into our tree.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

161
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:30.223
now we're in a layer lower,
we're inside 7, so

162
00:10:30.223 --> 00:10:36.180
the current is 7.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

163
00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:42.336
is 5 less than 7?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

164
00:10:42.336 --> 00:10:43.078
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes.

165
00:10:43.078 --> 00:10:45.620
I'm so good at math.

166
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.600
So and is there a left?

167
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:54.400
Does 7 have a left?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No,

168
00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:58.805
so what do we do?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: We set on current's left.

169
00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.960
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, there you go.

170
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.770
So that's insert in a nutshell.
