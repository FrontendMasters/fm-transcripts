1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.530
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What are we going
to be doing over the next six days?

2
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.300
I'm thinking forever, this is
the longest workshop I've ever taught.

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.943
This is Day zero is today and
we're gonna be doing Recursion and

4
00:00:14.943 --> 00:00:16.820
Object Oriented JavaScript.

5
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.450
This is just a review of these topics,
so it's not a deep dive.

6
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.610
And this is going to be necessary in
order to continue on with the class.

7
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.460
You don't have to master it today, but
these topics are gonna come up over and

8
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.210
over again as we go through.

9
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.970
And so this is a pre-req for
all the following five days, right.

10
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.520
Everything else you can kind of pick and
choose and come or go.

11
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.320
But day zero, which is today, if you don't
have extensive experience with recursion

12
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.340
or creating classes in JavaScript, then
today is gonna be really valuable for you.

13
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.990
Awesome, so what is this class?

14
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.310
This class is a practical
introduction to JavaScript,

15
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.992
it's a carefully curated class based

16
00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:11.400
on me helping hundreds of engineers
get jobs as software engineers,

17
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.460
and all these MOOCs.

18
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.390
I did basically,
like stole a bunch of syllabus on line of

19
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.930
all major universities and
took all the main topics and found

20
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.630
the ones that were the most repeated,
and then packaged it up for this class.

21
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.720
So it is a combination of
the interview stuff and

22
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.050
also what you would be
learning in a university.

23
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.220
So it's a good starting point for those of
you who are gonna be interviewing soon,

24
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.700
those of you who don't have a traditional
computer science background.

25
00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.110
Those of you who are just wanting to
level up with your JavaScript and

26
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.330
apply what you know to maybe something
that's a little more abstract, right.

27
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.300
We're not gonna be jQuerying, selecting,
and toggling stuff in this class.

28
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.480
We're gonna be creating abstract data
structures and doing operations on them.

29
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.110
And number five,

30
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.970
I'm gonna keep saying this, super useless
if you don't complete the exercises.

31
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.280
All nice to have the theory down, but
it is really, really important and

32
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.550
I say this over and over again, because
for some reason it doesn't quite make it.

33
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.760
Or maybe people don't know, but they
just don't commit, they're on the cliff.

34
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.720
They're like, okay, I want to jump
in the water, I have to jump.

35
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.440
If I want to learn data structure and

36
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.970
algorithms, I have to write
data structures and algorithms.

37
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.750
You just have to do it.

38
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.710
It's kinda scary and
It's kind of intimidating.

39
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.460
A lot of people approach this topic like
they are about to jump off a cliff, right.

40
00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.200
It's very very intimidating for
a lot of people and I hope that

41
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.690
we can have a conversation together and
make it a little bit less intimidating.

42
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.570
That is really up to a lot of you to
sort of engage me, ask questions,

43
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.950
throw back your understanding
of what I just said.

44
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.700
So that we can have this be more
like a learning laboratory and

45
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.750
not like me standing here talking at you

46
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.440
about all this theoretical bullshit
that maybe you don't care about.

47
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.240
You know what I mean?

48
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.840
So let's engage each other, let's talk
about it, I'm not a scary person.

49
00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.200
For those of you online, I'm only like
5'0" so not intimidating, I don't think.

50
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:21.150
Yeah, so I encourage you to make this, own
this experience, own what you don't know.

51
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.140
Rehash if you just want to feel
like rehashing, that's awesome,

52
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.810
I appreciate that.

53
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.185
It also makes me feel less lonely up here,
if you guys talk to me.

54
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.217
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

55
00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:38.150
what is this class not?

56
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.060
Even though this is a six day class,
might seem like, my gosh there's so

57
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.730
much, is not every data structure and
algorithm ever invented.

58
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.350
Believe it or not, people spend years and
years studying this topic,

59
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.550
there's books and
books this thick covering this topics.

60
00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.895
So it's absolutely not realistic to
think we are going to cover even

61
00:04:00.895 --> 00:04:07.290
10% of all of the data structures
in an algorithm field.

62
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.270
My implementations are not gonna be
the best solution for every case.

63
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.050
There's going to be different cases in
which you're going to apply your data

64
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.150
structures and algorithms.

65
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.100
And we're going to talk about them,
all the different cases and

66
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.810
try to help you reason about which ones
to choose and how you should go about it.

67
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.930
But the solutions are not gonna be
the only way to implement them.

68
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.550
There's going to be all kinds of different
styles, you can find them on the internet,

69
00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.410
I encourage you to,
you know, to investigate and

70
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.780
to widen your understanding
of different ones.

71
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.320
Again it's not math heavy or
theoretical, this is not the end.

72
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.850
If you're studying for
a technical interview,

73
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.300
this is not the end, this class.

74
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.130
You do this class, you do all the
exercises, and you're like okay, great.

75
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.700
This is not the end, there's so
many resources out there for

76
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.330
different interview questions.

77
00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.540
All these question banks that I encourage
you to do because there's lots and

78
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.260
lots and lots of different questions.

79
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.026
And again practice and actually coding
it out is going to get you there.

80
00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:09.030
And lastly, I'm friendly and

81
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.330
I'm nice but this isn't
necessarily smooth and friendly.

82
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.430
It's going to be a lot of content.

83
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.300
And so you know sometimes we're gonna
have to speed through some things and

84
00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.570
you might be left to
answer your own questions.

85
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.830
That doesn't mean don't ask me questions,
please try to ask me questions.

86
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.300
But we might get to the end for
example of the day and I'm like

87
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.970
crap we have to finish this content and
we might just speed through it.

88
00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.686
And you know we can always
talk after class for

89
00:05:34.686 --> 00:05:39.600
questions that I might have had to skip,
but just know that that might happen,

90
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.010
and I'm sorry but sometimes that happens.

91
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.990
Cool, any surprises here?

92
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:49.423
No?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: People

93
00:05:49.423 --> 00:05:52.409
are getting the wrong set
of slides it appears,

94
00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.900
they're not seeing those slides.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

95
00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.504
these slides are linked here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And when they go there,

96
00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:06.350
they get a 404.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Interesting.

97
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:12.784
Let's fix that, are they?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Very odd,

98
00:06:12.784 --> 00:06:19.661
let's see if I can help.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hm.

99
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:20.765
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It could be just not

100
00:06:20.765 --> 00:06:24.111
published or something, private.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, so

101
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:28.217
there should be a password.

102
00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:33.655
Let's, private,
usually I have a password predict, but

103
00:06:33.655 --> 00:06:40.743
I'll just make it public for now.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

104
00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:42.690
it is released to the world.

105
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:44.960
Everyone should have it now.

106
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.680
Thank you for your patience.
