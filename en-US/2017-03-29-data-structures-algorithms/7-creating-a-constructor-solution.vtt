00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.894
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's your example?

2
00:00:01.894 --> 00:00:02.847
&gt;&gt; off screen male: We made a yurt.

3
00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:03.874
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: A yurt, nice.

4
00:00:03.874 --> 00:00:06.539
&gt;&gt; off screen male: So I took one
function, which is the number of ribs,

5
00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:07.944
which are poles, I guess.

6
00:00:07.944 --> 00:00:10.040
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [CROSSTALK] Reduce.

7
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.023
&gt;&gt; off screen male: That's about it,
we have a website, MyYurt.io.

8
00:00:13.023 --> 00:00:14.709
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; off screen female: Patent pending.

9
00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:15.720
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Patent pending.

10
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.572
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Wow, I like it.

11
00:00:18.572 --> 00:00:22.450
So here's our yurt, and
what does our yurt take?

12
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.016
It takes ribs.

13
00:00:25.016 --> 00:00:27.380
Like this?

14
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.880
Like barbeque?
Mm.

15
00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:34.970
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, great.

16
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.900
So here we are.

17
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.750
We have our constructor function.

18
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.500
We're using the keyword this.

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.460
That's where we define our properties,
everything else is just magic.

20
00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:55.292
We have biancasHouse, cuz I want to
live in a Yurt when I grow up, for sure.

21
00:00:55.292 --> 00:01:01.070
New Yurt, and
then how many ribs on estimate, 50?

22
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.252
&gt;&gt; off screen female: You said 16,
but you can have 15.

23
00:01:03.252 --> 00:01:05.535
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'll have
50 ribs because why not.

24
00:01:05.535 --> 00:01:07.848
Wow, that's a big yurt.

25
00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:08.964
&gt;&gt; off screen male: It's a full rack.

26
00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:09.755
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

27
00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:11.963
&gt;&gt; off screen female: [LAUGH]
She's going to meet you.

28
00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:12.748
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'm hungry.

29
00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:15.474
All right,

30
00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:20.390
so now I have a yurt,
it has lots of ribs, barbecue ribs.

31
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.170
I am from the South, originally, so
I can get behind some ribs in my yurt.

32
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.860
We'll say that's a good
combination of my Southern and

33
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.430
my Berkeley just like, all together.

34
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.470
We also wanna have some
things on our yurt, right?

35
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.516
Some things that our yurt can do.

36
00:01:35.516 --> 00:01:36.825
What can our yurt do?

37
00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:39.571
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; off screen female: Our yurt can count

38
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:40.460
the ribs.

39
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.194
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Count ribs?

40
00:01:41.194 --> 00:01:44.992
&gt;&gt; off screen female: Yeah,
we should've made it do something cool.

41
00:01:46.153 --> 00:01:52.262
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

42
00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:56.104
if you have more than ten ribs,
we're definitely gonna console.log.

43
00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.886
Yum, hello, absolutely, uh-oh.

44
00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:06.038
Also please feel free to
correct my live coding,

45
00:02:06.038 --> 00:02:13.270
because sometimes in the moment, just
kind of, it just falls out of my brain.

46
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.600
So here we are.

47
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.476
So our main components here, that we don't
want to forget, we have our constructor

48
00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:22.490
function, we have our key word this,
that's where we define our properties.

49
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.400
We have our methods.

50
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.740
And again, your going to have
lots of properties, lots of

51
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.250
methods on your data structures and
the operations for them.

52
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.200
We have a function here.

53
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.190
Key word this here, in this function, is
gonna be referring to the instance, yeah?

54
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.419
That's kind of confusing sometimes,
.countRibs, right?

55
00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.959
It's gonna say, well this was
always gonna say young, right?

56
00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:05.370
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But
the keyword this, it's like our pronoun.

57
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.820
It's gonna be the instance.

58
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.110
That's not always true.

59
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.290
There are a few different rules for

60
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.400
the keyword this, but that's the one
that we're gonna follow today.

61
00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.261
Awesome, any questions?

62
00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:23.170
Yes.
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Steven,

63
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.246
he has a request that you'll also
show the ES6 or ES2015 syntax.

64
00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:29.752
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't know it.

65
00:03:29.752 --> 00:03:35.023
Sorry, I'm not an ES2015 kinda girl yet,
there's still time.

66
00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:36.177
However, I haven't gotten there.

67
00:03:39.754 --> 00:03:45.279
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Do you have
equa script 2015 class, Mark?

68
00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.294
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Everybody
still calls it ES6, but

69
00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:48.234
yeah we do-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

70
00:03:48.234 --> 00:03:50.228
I'm trying to get in with the-
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Yeah, we do.

71
00:03:50.228 --> 00:03:50.794
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

72
00:03:50.794 --> 00:03:53.179
&gt;&gt; off screen male: Aaron Frost.

73
00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:57.599
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so for those of
you who are totally into the ES6 thing,

74
00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.085
Aaron Frost's class,
you should check it out.
