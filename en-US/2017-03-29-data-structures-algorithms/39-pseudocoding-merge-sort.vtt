WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:01.720
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
you see how that works?

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:07.301
So this is the merge.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: This is divide.

3
00:00:07.301 --> 00:00:11.771
Dividing, conquering,
that's the name of the game today.

4
00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:17.445
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And it's recursive,

5
00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:23.823
see that?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

6
00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:25.001
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So instead of just sorting

7
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.115
in place, you cut everything up and
then you paste it back together?

8
00:00:28.115 --> 00:00:29.197
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.056
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

10
00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:37.680
We could look at a picture.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.688
You're can look at the YouTube
video of this [LAUGH] of them doing

12
00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:44.324
some Eastern European dance.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I

13
00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:45.874
won't force you to do it at this time.

14
00:00:45.874 --> 00:00:48.215
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really?

15
00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:49.095
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Really?

16
00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:50.052
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'm really not

17
00:00:50.052 --> 00:00:51.755
gonna force you.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: But really,

18
00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:53.610
you have another dance visualization?

19
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.110
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yes, really.

20
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

21
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.251
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Really,

22
00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:00.312
they have a dance for almost every major
sorting algorithm [LAUGH] there is.

23
00:01:00.312 --> 00:01:01.051
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

24
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:01.614
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's very

25
00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:02.615
awesome.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's

26
00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:03.630
awesome.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

27
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.518
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm gonna post that

28
00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:06.143
to my work [INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You should,

29
00:01:06.143 --> 00:01:08.556
I was really happy when
I've just found that one.

30
00:01:08.556 --> 00:01:09.359
It's ten

31
00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:12.520
years old,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

32
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.111
I just happened upon it.

33
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:19.201
All right, so here is our,

34
00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:24.215
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Merge sort happening.

35
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:31.724
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

36
00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:32.892
All right.

37
00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:37.928
So here's pseudocode for
the merge sort total.

38
00:01:37.928 --> 00:01:40.718
So we looked at the merge already.

39
00:01:40.718 --> 00:01:47.607
We wrote that separately.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So here's the deal.

40
00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.629
So if the list is less than two,
the length, return.

41
00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:53.186
That's our base case.

42
00:01:53.186 --> 00:01:56.202
Going to break into left and right.

43
00:01:56.202 --> 00:01:58.890
And then you're going to merge sort left.

44
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.177
Merge sort right.

45
00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:04.004
And then you're going to pass
it onto the merge routine.

46
00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:11.596
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

47
00:02:12.673 --> 00:02:13.597
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So here's one that has

48
00:02:13.597 --> 00:02:14.671
a little bit more detail.

49
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.755
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So it's just saying
that you're going to cut it in half.

50
00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:31.434
Left you're going to slice it.

51
00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:34.104
You're going to slice it.

52
00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:35.176
Pass it to the left.

53
00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:36.528
Pass it to the right.

54
00:02:36.528 --> 00:02:37.880
Merge left and right.

55
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.892
I'm going to do the thing that
I did with recursion yesterday.

56
00:02:40.892 --> 00:02:41.418
Remember that?

57
00:02:41.418 --> 00:02:45.931
Where I put it in a text editor.

58
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:53.539
And we kind of talked about it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

59
00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:58.598
let me make this very big.

60
00:02:58.598 --> 00:03:07.387
Is that good in the back size wise?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah?

61
00:03:07.387 --> 00:03:09.172
Tomar, is it good?
&gt;&gt; Tomar: It's good here.

62
00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:10.910
I don't know what what
they'll see on screen.

63
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You can't see

64
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:12.379
it either.

65
00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.899
Bigger?

66
00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.536
Good okay, here we go.

67
00:03:18.536 --> 00:03:19.773
All right, so here we are.

68
00:03:19.773 --> 00:03:24.402
Let's say that our array is,
what was our array before?

69
00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:30.710
Like 34, 83, 10, 9.

70
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:38.304
Five, that's four, whatever.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, cool.

71
00:03:38.304 --> 00:03:40.480
So here's our list.

72
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.091
And I'm just going to walk you
through what's happening, ok?

73
00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:47.665
So our base case, so we're going to call

74
00:03:47.665 --> 00:03:56.179
it
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

75
00:03:56.179 --> 00:04:00.304
here's our first one on our stack.

76
00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:02.356
So this is going to be FALSE.

77
00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:04.717
We're going to break it into two-halves.

78
00:04:04.717 --> 00:04:06.781
What are our halves going to look like?

79
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:09.772
Maybe it's going to look
something like this.

80
00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:14.563
34, 83, 10.

81
00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:16.388
That's going to be left.

82
00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:20.844
Right, 9, 1,

83
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:24.715
and 4, yeah?

84
00:04:24.715 --> 00:04:30.605
We're going to pass left here,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

85
00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:32.649
then we just call it again.

86
00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:35.469
So here we go.

87
00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:42.719
This is us going deep, deep,

88
00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:49.406
deep.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nope.

89
00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:57.999
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

90
00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:03.895
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So here's our list.

91
00:05:03.895 --> 00:05:06.681
We're going to break it up.

92
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:15.145
Maybe we'll do it this way.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So now this is left.

93
00:05:15.145 --> 00:05:18.164
This is right.

94
00:05:18.164 --> 00:05:20.476
We go here, we're passing our left,

95
00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:26.415
which is just 34,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

96
00:05:26.415 --> 00:05:30.898
I need to copy and
paste this again, so here we go.

97
00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:39.043
Oops.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All

98
00:05:39.043 --> 00:05:45.762
right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Are we

99
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.383
following what's going on?

100
00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:49.099
Any questions?

101
00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.418
So we're just drilling down.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Three

102
00:05:53.418 --> 00:05:56.687
would be true.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: See,

103
00:05:56.687 --> 00:05:58.224
you guys are watching.

104
00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.430
Did that on purpose just to trick you.

105
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.862
[LAUGH] [SOUND] It's true, so

106
00:06:04.862 --> 00:06:09.831
we're going to return.

107
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.586
So we're going to pop this off.

108
00:06:12.586 --> 00:06:15.721
Pop, it makes that sound
actually internally.

109
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:17.217
No, it doesn't.

110
00:06:17.217 --> 00:06:18.456
That would be awesome though if it did.

111
00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.400
And then we're going to go.

112
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.884
Right?
We popped off, we did that.

113
00:06:23.884 --> 00:06:29.005
Lsorted is now 34.

114
00:06:29.005 --> 00:06:29.957
We're good?

115
00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:31.540
Okay.

116
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:37.298
So now we have 83 and 10, and we're going
to go all the way, all the way down.

117
00:06:37.298 --> 00:06:42.371
And it's going to come back.

118
00:06:42.371 --> 00:06:42.946
It's going to come [INAUDIBLE].

119
00:06:42.946 --> 00:06:44.714
I'm going to cheat so we can save us time.

120
00:06:44.714 --> 00:06:51.045
It's going to come back sorted.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right.

121
00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:57.920
Because return of the merge is going to
be the merge routine of these two arrays.

122
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:03.154
So we're going to put in 34,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 34.

123
00:07:03.154 --> 00:07:05.161
And then we're also going
to put in the 10 and

124
00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:09.920
the 83 as well.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And what this whole

125
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.124
merge thing returns is
just one array that's 10,

126
00:07:16.124 --> 00:07:20.928
34, 82.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 83.

127
00:07:20.928 --> 00:07:22.474
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 82.

128
00:07:22.474 --> 00:07:27.671
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

129
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:31.667
it also adds one, takes away one randomly.

130
00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:33.811
This is why the computer is
going to do it and not me.

131
00:07:33.811 --> 00:07:38.040
Okay, so we're returning here.

132
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.309
So this is the value that we're returning,
this sorted thing here.

133
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:49.036
So here's our return.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

134
00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:52.206
the arrow says that's
what's being returned,

135
00:07:52.206 --> 00:07:56.929
so we pop this off.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

136
00:07:56.929 --> 00:08:00.907
now we're back here, and we're going to-.

137
00:08:00.907 --> 00:08:04.207
So LSorteds is now this, so
I'm just going to erase this for

138
00:08:04.207 --> 00:08:08.479
us.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Everyone following how

139
00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:09.630
that happened?

140
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.683
Any questions about how that happened?

141
00:08:11.683 --> 00:08:13.790
Did you guys see what happened?

142
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:14.725
Okay.

143
00:08:14.725 --> 00:08:18.675
So now we have right,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And it's going to do

144
00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:21.859
the same thing all the way down to
the right, and it's going to come back up.

145
00:08:21.859 --> 00:08:24.235
And this is going to be magically sorted.

146
00:08:31.765 --> 00:08:33.138
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then we're going to

147
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:38.481
pass it in here, which then is going to
merge them and return the sorted array.

148
00:08:46.226 --> 00:08:48.827
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, merge sort,

149
00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:54.490
we divided and we conquered two mountains.

150
00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:00.755
We dug deep to the end, down, down, down,
so we only one sorted list of length one.

151
00:09:00.755 --> 00:09:05.784
We had multiple sorted lists of
length one, then we came up.

152
00:09:05.784 --> 00:09:10.554
We merged them, merged them,
merged them until we had one big

153
00:09:10.554 --> 00:09:14.195
sorted array.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Seemed like a lot of

154
00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:15.479
work?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Mm-hm.

155
00:09:15.479 --> 00:09:16.415
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Surprisingly,

156
00:09:16.415 --> 00:09:20.792
it's not that much work,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Compared to bubble

157
00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:25.194
sort or something like that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's a lot of work for

158
00:09:25.194 --> 00:09:27.513
our brains, but for the computer,

159
00:09:27.513 --> 00:09:31.629
it's actually faster because
the comparisons are much less.

160
00:09:31.629 --> 00:09:33.470
I might be getting ahead of myself.

161
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:36.220
Are we good with how that all works?

162
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.486
Question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I have a question.

163
00:09:37.486 --> 00:09:38.175
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.

164
00:09:38.175 --> 00:09:41.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: On the mergeSort, left and

165
00:09:41.202 --> 00:09:47.133
right says, but
the return says just for [INAUDIBLE].

166
00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:50.701
But we returned and
the merges [INAUDIBLE].

167
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:51.397
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah.

168
00:09:51.397 --> 00:09:52.398
So.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Why do

169
00:09:52.398 --> 00:09:56.369
we say [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What's happening in

170
00:09:56.369 --> 00:09:57.644
this merge sort,

171
00:09:57.644 --> 00:10:00.056
is that what you're asking?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

172
00:10:00.056 --> 00:10:03.860
That one word merge says is just merging,
right?

173
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.385
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

174
00:10:04.385 --> 00:10:07.451
it's merging them in the correct order.

175
00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:11.256
Just, it's sort of.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The left and

176
00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:13.296
the right result.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

177
00:10:13.296 --> 00:10:16.371
you pass the left and the right and
then they are already sorted.

178
00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:17.379
But they're two different ones.

179
00:10:17.379 --> 00:10:21.054
So what the merge does is it
makes it into one sorted array.

180
00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:23.594
Does that make sense?

181
00:10:23.594 --> 00:10:26.562
Yeah, we can talk about it
more one on one when we do

182
00:10:26.562 --> 00:10:29.126
the exercise too.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Just my question is

183
00:10:29.126 --> 00:10:32.754
the above is merge sort,
that one is merged now so

184
00:10:32.754 --> 00:10:36.500
I now I understand.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, cool.
