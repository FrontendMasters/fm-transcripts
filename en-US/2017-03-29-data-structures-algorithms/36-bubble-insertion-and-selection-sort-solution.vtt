00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.880
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
let's talk about bubble sort and then,

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.990
in the interest of time, we are just
gonna hop and merge sort after this.

3
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.420
There are solutions on the interweb
that you can peek through.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.570
If you have questions, I'll take
questions you know whenever about them.

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.370
But we want to get to the needy
stuff which is our recursive sorts

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.000
because these are slow.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.320
They're,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: They're slow.

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.744
They're not as useful, but
it's a good introduction.

9
00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:29.297
Cool?

10
00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:31.324
Here's our bubbleSort.

11
00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:37.127
So our bubbleSort has this concept of
a wall, which is the end of the array.

12
00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:41.892
The reason we do that is because
the end of the array after each

13
00:00:41.892 --> 00:00:44.420
pass Is gonna be sorted.

14
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.000
So the wall, after each pass,
will be decremented.

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.840
And the array becomes more and
more sorted, so it goes backwards.

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.430
So that's our wall,
we start at the length of the array.

17
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.990
And while it's greater
that are equaled in 0.

18
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.660
We're gonna loop,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Loop until the wall.

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.410
If it's bigger than the one on the left,
we swap them.

20
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.110
Some people were asking
about swap routines.

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.890
We have one over here that kind of fancy.

22
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.080
It's a Bitwise swap.

23
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.430
You can swap however you want.

24
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.500
It doesn't really matter.

25
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.910
So we're gonna swap it.

26
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.645
Once you get through it,
decrement the wall.

27
00:01:27.645 --> 00:01:31.258
[SOUND] Keeps going, keeps going.

28
00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:34.249
We're gonna return sorted array

29
00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.919
[INAUDIBLE].
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Who got through

30
00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:37.810
the bubble sort?

31
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.560
All righty, cool.

32
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.150
Did anyone do it differently?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did nest the four loops?

33
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.760
That's what we did.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: DId nest a four loops

34
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.285
instead of a y loop and a 4 loop.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm hm.

35
00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:53.149
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, anything else?

36
00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.550
Any big key takeaways here?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No?

37
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.540
How did you find that, was that
a challenge, was that intermediate?

38
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.230
Or was it straight forward
in your experience?

39
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: This one seemed the most

40
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.643
straight forward of the three.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, yeah.

41
00:02:12.643 --> 00:02:15.640
I would agree, cool.

42
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.414
Anyone else?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anyone find this

43
00:02:18.414 --> 00:02:20.416
difficult?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No,

44
00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:24.360
no-one's gonna admit that
in front of everyone.

45
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.620
I think it's hard if you've
never done it before.

46
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.220
Yeah.
Once you do it, then you have it.

47
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.000
You have it in your pocket and
it's not as hard the second time.

48
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.435
It's not as hard the third time.

49
00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:41.706
I think the second time you do something,
often it's just as hard as the first time.

50
00:02:41.706 --> 00:02:46.190
But once you get down to the third time,
you're good to go.

51
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.880
I used that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

52
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.188
did you name your variable, wall,
so that's it's stopping the loop.

53
00:02:51.188 --> 00:02:51.928
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm,

54
00:02:51.928 --> 00:02:52.672
mm-hm.

55
00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:53.536
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.

56
00:02:55.013 --> 00:02:56.254
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, yep.
