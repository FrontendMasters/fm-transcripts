00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.696
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, and
here's just some examples of how this is

2
00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:10.841
executed, and you have your instances,
so your house, you have the office, and

3
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:18.200
then your house at countFloors is going to
show, it's gonna say, I have two floors.

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.739
theOffice.countFloors says
I have 12 floors, cool?

5
00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.791
No surprises, we're good to go?

6
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:31.954
All right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

7
00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:37.406
things to note, there are other ways
to implement classes in JavaScript,

8
00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:40.272
this is sort of the industry standard.

9
00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:41.080
Then it's what's expected.

10
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.560
There are lots of debates on them, which
one's better, how to do it specifically,

11
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.380
I'm not really gonna engage in that
right now, It's not really important for

12
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.740
what we're talking about.

13
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.260
You can search on the internet
different class patterns in JavaScript,

14
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.890
and people have lots of angry opinions
just like, it's like one of those tabs and

15
00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.730
spaces kind of things.

16
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.176
They're super nitpicky about it,
however for your interviews you're

17
00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:09.260
probably going to be expected to know
the pseudo classical style, most likely.

18
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.800
You might see elements of this in
you favorite JavaScript framework.

19
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.876
So even if you haven't done this and
created classes yourself,

20
00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:19.342
you've probably been using
them in different way,

21
00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:21.639
especially if you're using the key word,
new,

22
00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:27.114
it's probably somewhere under the hood.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome.

23
00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:31.552
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so

24
00:01:31.552 --> 00:01:33.020
one last thing.

25
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.282
Subclassing and inheritance
are not covered in this course.

26
00:01:38.282 --> 00:01:42.009
If you want more information you
can follow this link to the blog.

27
00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:42.940
You can learn all about it.

28
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.820
It's very interesting,
also very important, but again,

29
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.250
outside of the scope of this class.
