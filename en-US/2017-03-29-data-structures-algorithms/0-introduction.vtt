[MUSIC]

2
00:00:37.947 --> 00:00:42.067
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Thank you everyone for
coming and giving me a week of your life,

3
00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:45.820
so that we can cook more data
structures and algorithms.

4
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.940
So this is a cooking class,
what does that mean?

5
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.010
Let's look at these awesome
cartoons that I found in another or

6
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.770
just like the most perfect thing ever.

7
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.320
So there's us, I'm wearing the chef hat,
that's you with the smile, and

8
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.870
you have the tools.

9
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.123
You have your editor,
your laptop and the internet.

10
00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:08.390
And you're ready to go, that's step one.

11
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.540
Step two, I'm gonna stand up here and
talk at you and

12
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.900
do some demonstrations
about different concepts.

13
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.860
And you're gonna sit there a watch,
and raise your hand and

14
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.739
ask questions.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're gonna do some

15
00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:26.360
stuff together, this is more of the
interactive question slide, or cartoon.

16
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.533
Where I'm gonna show you some stuff,
you're gonna also be doing it as well, so

17
00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:31.580
here we are.

18
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.310
It looks like we're cutting
corn on the cob, or something.

19
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.340
We're doing it together and
then you're gonna do it.

20
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.440
So this is the key here, right?

21
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.000
The key here is that you need
to implement these yourself.

22
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.870
So, there's me, just cheering you on,
woo, which I am really good at.

23
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.330
And there's you, in the kitchen.

24
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.990
Cooking out these data structures and
algorithms.

25
00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.850
Again, this is the key,

26
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.840
because we can talk about it
theoretically about it all day.

27
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.330
Trust me if you give me a chance, I will.

28
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.670
I will just talk to you
all day about this stuff.

29
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.820
But really the gold is when you're
implementing them yourself.

30
00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.650
When you're on the job and
you have to do it.

31
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.544
When you are in an interview and
you need to answer a question.

32
00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:20.610
Talking theory,
drawing pictures will only get you so far.

33
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.040
It might get you part of the way, right?

34
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.720
But the doing it yourself is going to be
super crucial, so with that this is not.

35
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.350
I just love it, this is so
perfect, my god.

36
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.210
It's not like a cooking show, where
you're just gonna sit back and relax, and

37
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.750
they talk to you.

38
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.030
And then suddenly you're gonna be an
expert in data structures and algorithms.

39
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.942
This is a very complex topic, and
it really just is gonna take time for

40
00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:48.868
you to dedicate, to actually
implementing these yourself, cool?

41
00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:52.083
So there you are, byond this class,

42
00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:56.310
continuing to cook with
your algorithms book.

43
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.970
Isn't this just a perfect cartoon?

44
00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.730
I just can't get over it, I love it.

45
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.960
I didn't make these myself either.

46
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.380
So that's this class, and
that's what I mean by cooking.

47
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.230
So a lot of people,
they'll come to a class and

48
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.200
they think you know I paid money for
a class.

49
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.200
I'm gonna be serve this information, and

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.440
maybe the in traditional
educational settings.

51
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.865
You may have a professor,
they may have a silver platter and say,

52
00:03:21.865 --> 00:03:26.714
here is the information,
here is a here's your hash table.

53
00:03:26.714 --> 00:03:30.435
And I'm gonna serve it to you, and you're
gonna sit a table with a white table cloth

54
00:03:30.435 --> 00:03:31.990
and like lots of forks and spoons.

55
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.290
And you don't know which one to
touch first, you know what I mean,

56
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.080
that kind of setting?

57
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.700
Are you guys following my visual here?

58
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.470
So this is not this class,
this is not a five-star restaurant,

59
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.040
this is a five-star kitchen, right?

60
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.180
You're gonna go in the kitchen,
I'm gonna coach you through.

61
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.130
But you're going to be practicing
these data structures and

62
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.870
algorithms on your own.

63
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.960
You're going to be cooking them up,
that make sense?

64
00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.260
You guys like my analogy?

65
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.000
It's awesome, right?

66
00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.392
I love it.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

67
00:04:00.392 --> 00:04:01.430
who am I?

68
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.720
I'm an educator, engineer,
I co-founded Telegraph Academy, and

69
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.560
currently I'm the Interim Managing
Director of Hack Reactor Remote Beta.

70
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.740
So I have a lot of experience in immersive
coding, educational environments,

71
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.460
teaching Mostly teaching,
but a lot of other things.

72
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.330
Job placement, stuff like that.

73
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.830
If you're curious, you can read my bio.

74
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.340
It's not super interesting.

75
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.430
My shoes, we were talking about that.

76
00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.504
I kind of skip my intro.

77
00:04:26.504 --> 00:04:32.238
My favorite shoes are probably like
sandals like the one's that I'm wearing,

78
00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.300
like Velcro, Team Velcro.

79
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.660
What does that say about me?

80
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:38.820
I'm kind of a hippie nerd.

81
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.530
I live in Berkeley, and
I just embrace that.

82
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.590
So, we'll be doing yoga.

83
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.060
We'll be drinking tea.

84
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.290
We'll be staring deeply into each
other's souls as we cook organic.

85
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.116
Data structures only, okay.

86
00:04:52.116 --> 00:04:59.110
Sustainable [LAUGH] Data structures,
so that's me.

87
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.030
A little bit of background on what do
I even know about data structures and

88
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.460
algorithms.

89
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.240
So basically,
it all started just a few years ago,

90
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.780
when I was inspired by in Queens
algorithm coding challenge.

91
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.190
I found it really really difficult and
those of you who

92
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.520
may have known me from other classes or
are getting to know me will know.

93
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.870
That if something is hard for me or

94
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.760
is a challenge then I'm going to jump
on it, that's a motivator for me.

95
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.680
I'm a very very competitive person,
and I'm just like, my god,

96
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.206
if it's winning, I have to beat it.

97
00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:35.870
So that's [LAUGH] kind of why I
started this algorithms meet up,

98
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.180
to start, to basically force
myself to learn about algorithms.

99
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.930
So every week we would come together,
I would teach about an algorithm,

100
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.370
we'd solve it together.

101
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.660
And that was sort of the beginning,
the seeds of this course.

102
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.410
And I was working at
Hack Reactor at the time.

103
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.647
And because of this I had to
study [LAUGH] a lot MOOCs.

104
00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:57.910
And all these kinds of data structures and
algorithms classes.

105
00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.820
Last year, I founded Telegraph Academy.

106
00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.430
A couple weeks ago, I just started as
Interim Managing Director of Remote Data.

107
00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.640
And over the year or so,
I officially created this course with

108
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.800
a couple of friends of mine,
Jeff Lee and Katrina Uychaco.

109
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.630
So, shout out to them for all their help.

110
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.580
And so what does this say?

111
00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.070
This says that I have a lot of
experience working with people,

112
00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.980
learning data structures and algorithms.

113
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.630
But this doesn't mean, I don't have
a PhD in data structures in algorithms.

114
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.460
I'm not the authority on this topic.

115
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.970
But what I can do is I can
coach you through them and

116
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.400
share on the practical aspects of it.

117
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.600
So this is not a theoretical
analysis of algorithms.

118
00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.760
This is, how are you really gonna
be using this on your day to day.

119
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.750
Where does this show up in interviews and
things like that?

120
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.930
Does that make sense?

121
00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.450
So there's a spectrum of
classes you can take on this.

122
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.440
There's the practical side, and then
there's like, my god we're writing proofs,

123
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.970
and there's math, right?

124
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.100
We're gonna be a little bit here,
does that make sense?

125
00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.270
So we're gonna be doing like big
on notation and a little bit of

126
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.840
like how you can estimate the speed
of your algorithm, stuff like that.

127
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.440
But it's not gonna be a hardcore analysis,
math kind of stuff.

128
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.879
So for those of you who,
who here has a math background?

129
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:20.750
You might be like aw, but, we can nerd out
about it off the beaten path if we want.
