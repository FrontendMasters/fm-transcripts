WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
zoom in for a second.

2
00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.640
Continue zooming in.

3
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.810
We're gonna do some pseudocode for

4
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.340
the merge routine.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: All right, L and

5
00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.218
R the lists?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, we have left and

6
00:00:08.218 --> 00:00:12.094
then we have right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

7
00:00:12.094 --> 00:00:13.218
do you guys wanna do that with me or

8
00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:20.803
do you wanna do it on your own?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

9
00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:21.500
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Which one?

10
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.219
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

11
00:00:23.219 --> 00:00:24.026
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can we do it with

12
00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:24.850
you?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Sure.

13
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.170
That just means I'm gonna ask you and

14
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.030
you're gonna have to talk
in front of everyone.

15
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.930
So you have to be talkative.

16
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.580
Do you guys commit?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yes.

17
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.430
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Can you put your,

18
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.550
how does scouts honor work?

19
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
Is it like this?

20
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.034
Can we scout's honor?

21
00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:42.020
Or what's this one, this one's Star Trek?

22
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.795
Okay, all right, great.

23
00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.021
So just to review,

24
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:50.962
what is the merge routine again?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We have two

25
00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:52.100
sorted lists.

26
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.590
We go through each sorted list.

27
00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.310
We put the smallest one next and
we keep moving around.

28
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.830
Yeah, okay.

29
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.830
Any questions about that?

30
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.406
Does everyone got that in their head?

31
00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:12.451
Awesome, okay, great.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

32
00:01:12.451 --> 00:01:13.325
who wants to go first?

33
00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:18.372
What's the first thing that we need to do?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Compare L[0] to R[0].

34
00:01:18.372 --> 00:01:19.427
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

35
00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:24.072
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if L[0] is what?

36
00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:25.012
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Greater than-

37
00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:26.033
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or less than, yeah.

38
00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:32.837
&gt; R [0].
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Wait,

39
00:01:32.837 --> 00:01:36.284
this is not pseudocode.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

40
00:01:36.284 --> 00:01:37.643
Pseudo pseudocode.

41
00:01:44.064 --> 00:01:45.760
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

42
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.953
Put 0 = R [0].
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm assuming,

43
00:01:50.953 --> 00:01:53.161
do we have a second?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, we can call it,

44
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:54.938
you wanna call it output?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah,

45
00:01:54.938 --> 00:01:58.900
anything's really fine.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so-

46
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.730
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So then output 0 equals-

47
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.877
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So push lower number,

48
00:02:01.877 --> 00:02:05.720
which in this case is R [ 0 ], right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

49
00:02:09.737 --> 00:02:10.283
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To,

50
00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:16.951
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To output array, so

51
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.932
seem fair?

52
00:02:18.932 --> 00:02:20.137
Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

53
00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:26.165
then push the other L's here.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Else?

54
00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:28.103
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well.

55
00:02:28.103 --> 00:02:29.636
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Else if?

56
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.621
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Elsa from Frozen?

57
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.284
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's not else,

58
00:02:37.284 --> 00:02:41.541
you want to do it any, so
I guess within the if you

59
00:02:41.541 --> 00:02:45.521
could then do push L 0.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

60
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:46.917
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, but what about for

61
00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:51.410
the case where- No, just what if
the next one in R is smaller than L?

62
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.740
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It can't be, right?

63
00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.860
Or can it be?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It could be.

64
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It absolutely could be.

65
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.884
So you're always gonna have
to compare back and forth.

66
00:02:59.884 --> 00:03:01.200
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cuz they're gonna be

67
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.107
sorted a bunch of high numbers, then one
could be sorted a bunch of low numbers.

68
00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:10.276
In which case you might have to take
all the ones from the left first, and

69
00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:12.477
then all the ones from the right.

70
00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:13.669
Okay.
It could be that way,

71
00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.987
you know?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So yeah, sorry,

72
00:03:17.987 --> 00:03:21.061
go back to else.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] [LAUGH] Let's

73
00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:26.436
see, let's try the back row.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Us?

74
00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:28.756
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or [LAUGH] the middle

75
00:03:28.756 --> 00:03:29.629
rows.

76
00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.369
But, yeah, anyone, anyone.

77
00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:43.030
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so

78
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.090
we have an important step
here that I will give to you.

79
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.620
So we push the lower number which in
this case (R(0) to the output array.

80
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.960
We then need to move our pointer, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

81
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.670
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: To the next one.

82
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.371
So how do we do that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You move the pointer

83
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:07.000
that you used.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

84
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.930
So maybe we need to like have a pointer?

85
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.149
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH] Like have a pointer.

86
00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.941
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Something like that?

87
00:04:14.941 --> 00:04:15.508
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

88
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.123
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So then this is gonna

89
00:04:20.123 --> 00:04:23.614
be Lpointer, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

90
00:04:23.614 --> 00:04:26.648
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, now,

91
00:04:26.648 --> 00:04:28.270
come on.

92
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.741
We can do this, look at that, beautiful,

93
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:38.704
okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All

94
00:04:38.704 --> 00:04:44.099
right.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

95
00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.538
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

96
00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:46.894
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then our pointer.

97
00:04:46.894 --> 00:04:50.029
There we go.

98
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:58.430
And then, so we just took,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The first one, maybe.

99
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.298
So we wanna increment our Rpointer, right?

100
00:05:01.298 --> 00:05:02.941
Yeah.

101
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:09.863
Rpointer++, oops.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So bad at pseudocode.

102
00:05:09.863 --> 00:05:14.674
Increment Rpointer, okay.

103
00:05:14.674 --> 00:05:22.519
Else.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just

104
00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:29.001
push the left one in increment.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Else

105
00:05:29.001 --> 00:05:35.282
[CROSSTALK] push.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Push

106
00:05:35.282 --> 00:05:40.380
what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just to say Lpointer.

107
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.942
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: L pointer, okay.

108
00:05:41.942 --> 00:05:45.547
Which in this case starting off as zero,

109
00:05:45.547 --> 00:05:51.530
right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

110
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.440
into the output array.
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

111
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.692
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, probably need

112
00:05:57.692 --> 00:06:04.781
an output array.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Some empty array,

113
00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.384
maybe.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great.

114
00:06:13.202 --> 00:06:14.454
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So I'm just cleaning

115
00:06:14.454 --> 00:06:19.308
this up again.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'm just gonna

116
00:06:19.308 --> 00:06:20.830
call this RP.

117
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:29.681
RP I like that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

118
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:35.084
so we've pushed.

119
00:06:35.084 --> 00:06:39.800
So far we're like okay,
is the right bigger or is the left?

120
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.630
Okay, if the right is smaller,
we're gonna put it onto our new one.

121
00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.024
Awesome, now we're saying, okay, our left
one is smaller, we're gonna push that

122
00:06:48.024 --> 00:06:52.552
onto the next one, right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great, and

123
00:06:52.552 --> 00:06:55.652
what's the next thing we have to do?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Think you meant the left

124
00:06:55.652 --> 00:06:59.645
point.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Great.

125
00:07:03.907 --> 00:07:05.532
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you need to move?

126
00:07:08.482 --> 00:07:09.736
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Move what?

127
00:07:09.736 --> 00:07:10.487
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The R and

128
00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:14.960
the L based on where
they took the number off.

129
00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.670
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

130
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:19.743
we incremented the pointers, but I think
you're bringing us to our next point.

131
00:07:19.743 --> 00:07:22.142
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

132
00:07:22.142 --> 00:07:23.022
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]

133
00:07:23.022 --> 00:07:25.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: [LAUGH] I love that.

134
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.790
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I love puns.

135
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Our next point which

136
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:35.930
is, okay, this is a procedure that
runs once and then it's over.

137
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.666
So we are [LAUGH] only gonna have
array at maximum length 1 for

138
00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:44.191
our output.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You know

139
00:07:44.191 --> 00:07:44.895
what I'm saying?

140
00:07:44.895 --> 00:07:48.608
Yeah, we have to loop.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Mm-hm.

141
00:07:49.913 --> 00:07:51.603
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Until we've gone through

142
00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:55.719
every number.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Until when?

143
00:07:55.719 --> 00:08:01.816
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

144
00:08:04.496 --> 00:08:06.824
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, until L and

145
00:08:06.824 --> 00:08:09.467
R.l or something.

146
00:08:09.467 --> 00:08:11.696
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

147
00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:21.148
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's equal to, LPR or

148
00:08:21.148 --> 00:08:27.961
something to that effect.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

149
00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:30.820
so let's walk through this.

150
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:36.200
So we have our two arrays,
we are initializing two pointers,

151
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.570
we have our left pointer and
our right pointer starting at zero, right?

152
00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.110
We have an output array, empty.

153
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.160
That's gonna be our answer.

154
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:48.310
We're gonna loop,
as long as both our left pointer and

155
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:54.169
our right pointer are less than the length

156
00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:59.660
of the left and
right arrays minus one, or whatever.

157
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.610
We're gonna keep running
this if else statement.

158
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:05.880
Yeah?

159
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:08.662
Great, so let's indent that properly so

160
00:09:08.662 --> 00:09:13.096
that's really clear.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

161
00:09:13.096 --> 00:09:16.694
if,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Left is

162
00:09:16.694 --> 00:09:18.916
greater than right.

163
00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:25.840
We're gonna add the right.

164
00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.580
Otherwise, we're gonna push the left one.

165
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.080
Yeah?

166
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.930
Cool.
So this is the basic logic around here.

167
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.790
There's a few bugs,
like what if it's undefined?

168
00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:37.210
Stuff like that.

169
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:41.360
But, for
the most part this is the merge logic.

170
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.620
Any questions about this?

171
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.020
This is just one part of the merge sort.

172
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:53.883
Does anyone see any major blaring errors?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,

173
00:09:53.883 --> 00:09:57.056
when you get to the point where one or
left or right is empty.

174
00:09:57.056 --> 00:09:58.090
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

175
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.104
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's what you're talking

176
00:09:59.104 --> 00:10:00.770
about, is a bug that
we can work out later?

177
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.430
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah,

178
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.047
so you have to account for that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

179
00:10:03.047 --> 00:10:03.859
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It should only be

180
00:10:03.859 --> 00:10:06.376
like,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well,

181
00:10:06.376 --> 00:10:08.805
I don't know, I'll let you figure it out.

182
00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:09.501
I don't wanna give you too much.

183
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:11.222
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

184
00:10:13.356 --> 00:10:14.043
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?

185
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:17.863
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then you're gonna

186
00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:25.410
return your output right after.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I think this is solid.

187
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:30.280
A couple bugs in there,
but the logic flows

188
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.830
in line with my understanding
of how the merge routine works.

189
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.789
Does anyone have a different idea
of how the merger team should work?

190
00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:45.580
There's some conflicting
brain stuff happening, no?

191
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:50.902
We're swapping place instead of pushing,
but

192
00:10:50.902 --> 00:10:56.410
that's quite more complicated.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Well in this case we

193
00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:01.570
can't really swap in place,
in this particular case,

194
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.240
because we're just doing a snippet.

195
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:11.390
But it's possible.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But not right now.

196
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:11.986
But yeah, good thought.

197
00:11:11.986 --> 00:11:19.520
Okay, anything else?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, all right.

198
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.060
So that's the merge routine.

199
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:27.680
That's the combine and the work, cuz
the merge is sorting and it's combining.

200
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.899
Awesome.

201
00:11:31.899 --> 00:11:32.654
Two for one.

202
00:11:32.654 --> 00:11:35.030
So here's a picture for us.

203
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:40.010
So when we're going
through the divide part,

204
00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:44.070
we're gonna divide doot,
doot, doot all the way down.

205
00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:44.885
This my each doot.

206
00:11:44.885 --> 00:11:46.918
Doot, doot, doot, doot.

207
00:11:46.918 --> 00:11:48.031
You see that.

208
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:50.618
So we cut it in half.

209
00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:54.800
And then we cut it in half until
we get to a length of one.

210
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.780
PS that's your base case, hint, hint.

211
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:03.490
Then once we get to our arrays of 1,
those are all sorted, right?

212
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.460
When you have an array of 1 element,
sorted, awesome.

213
00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.287
Then we merge.

214
00:12:08.287 --> 00:12:13.463
We say, which one is less?

215
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.520
We'll put it, just like the merge routine.

216
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.860
So this is the merge routine for 1.

217
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.720
This is the merge routine for
when the length is 2.

218
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.260
Merge, merge, merge.

219
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.510
And this is the one that
we did as an example.
