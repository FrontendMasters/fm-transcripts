00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.610
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, so fad diets.

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.612
What do we know about fad diets?

3
00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:08.626
People start these diets and
they think they're gonna work.

4
00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:12.426
They're gonna lose all this weight or
they're gonna get a six pack or

5
00:00:12.426 --> 00:00:14.337
whatever it is that they wanna do.

6
00:00:14.337 --> 00:00:16.127
And it doesn't work, and
that's why it's a fad diet.

7
00:00:16.127 --> 00:00:20.413
So here are some fad diets in this class,
in programming,

8
00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:23.484
in general, that I found from students.

9
00:00:23.484 --> 00:00:26.406
It's basically,
you think it's gonna work but it's not.

10
00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:30.639
So, first one is reading or
watching a video or

11
00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:38.148
a blog about this concept means I'm gonna
know how to implement it and code it out.

12
00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:41.020
Sorry, it doesn't work like that.

13
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.860
I'm going to look it up later,
no you're not.

14
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.550
My brain hurts, I'm not smart.

15
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.852
Trust me, my brain hurts, too.

16
00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:51.110
We're gonna be doing this for six days,

17
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.390
my brain is gonna be all
kinds of hurting after this.

18
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.300
So failing an interview means I'm a bad
engineer because interviews are testing

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.080
for my engineering ability.

20
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.150
Unfortunately that's not true at all.

21
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.120
Most technical interviews are not a good
measure of your abilities as an engineer.

22
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.150
For whatever reason, there are certain
metrics that tech companies

23
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.490
have employed to measure your
ability as a software engineer.

24
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.180
The bad news is that it actually
doesn't work at all, and

25
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.000
there's been many study's
proving this wrong.

26
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.440
Everyone is arguing right now about
a new type of tech interview,

27
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.640
that it's a better test of your skill and
people are trying that out.

28
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.720
But still, these data structures and
algorithms questions are gonna

29
00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.400
be typical of an interview for
a software engineering position.

30
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.440
And like Mark was saying,
he's been an engineer for 15 years, and

31
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.880
he doesn't even understand this.

32
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.790
It doesn't mean he's a bad engineer.

33
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.580
It just means this has very little
to do with what you are going to do

34
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.120
on a day to day.

35
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.990
You can apply these concepts.

36
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.613
But for the most part,

37
00:02:00.613 --> 00:02:05.823
they're almost a separate topic.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

38
00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:09.009
and then the last one is my favorite.

39
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.981
I read the solutions and
now I understand it.

40
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:15.600
It's not true, try it first before
you look at the solutions please.

41
00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.890
There are all these ways to give yourself
a false sense of accomplishment.

42
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.230
Yeah, it feels good,
you should read the slides and all that.

43
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.910
But the real goal is to
be able to code it out.

44
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.650
And so reading the solutions,
skipping the exercises,

45
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.820
anything that's gonna lead you down
that path, is the wrong path, right?

46
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.550
So just know that.

47
00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.510
And what else did I wanna say about that?

48
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.075
I had something and
I just went, just is gone.

49
00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:46.463
What else?

50
00:02:46.463 --> 00:02:52.430
[BLANK AUDIO] Okay,
maybe that's all I got.

51
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.970
Great, so with that how to succeed,
don't fall for

52
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.950
any of the fad diets
that I just explained.

53
00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.120
Pair with someone else taking the course.

54
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.180
Being able to explain your thought process
with another person is gonna be super

55
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.706
crucial in the communication aspect that
a lot of you guys were talking about.

56
00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:17.410
I wanna be able to
communicate like an engineer.

57
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.170
I wanna be able to get a job.

58
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.830
This is all based on communication.

59
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.660
Can you talk your interviewer
through your thought process?

60
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.570
Can you get someone else
on the same page so

61
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.840
that you can move forward
with the next line of code?

62
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.240
So try to do the exercise without
looking at the solutions.

63
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.904
If you can't control yourself
because you know the solutions

64
00:03:38.904 --> 00:03:40.973
are there on the Internet.

65
00:03:40.973 --> 00:03:43.183
When you look at them, [LAUGH] try and

66
00:03:43.183 --> 00:03:46.579
do the solution without looking
at it at the same time.

67
00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:47.580
Does that make sense?

68
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.480
So say you go, and you're,
my gosh, there's a marshmallow and

69
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.008
I have to eat it, I can't wait 15 minutes.

70
00:03:54.008 --> 00:03:57.530
You could [LAUGH] go look at it,
and then come back, but

71
00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.660
don't look at it while you're
implementing your solution.

72
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.350
And you can go back and
forth, back and forth.

73
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.010
As long as eventually you
get to a point where you can

74
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.750
come up with your own
solution without memorizing.

75
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:10.490
That's really important.

76
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.460
Don't memorize a solution,
cuz it's not gonna help you.

77
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.960
Come up with your own process for
these solutions.

78
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.930
Be okay with failing.

79
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.700
You're gonna mess up,
you might ask a question that

80
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.290
makes you feel like it's a dumb question,
it's probably not a dumb question.

81
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.920
So, be okay with that, we're here to
learn and learning is a hard process,

82
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.250
learning will hurt your brain and
this is one of those things.

83
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.890
These topics, I think it's
the name really, like algorithms.

84
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.483
Like that word is this long, and

85
00:04:45.483 --> 00:04:49.112
anything with a word that long is
automatically intimidating, right?

86
00:04:49.112 --> 00:04:56.830
But we're gonna learn,
we gonna mess up together,

87
00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.560
it's gonna be awesome, I already messed
up, it's only been like a minute.

88
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.340
So, we'll be here together, it'll be okay.

89
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.450
Ask me questions, please ask me questions.

90
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.910
Please, please, please ask me questions.

91
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.700
Okay, do you guys promise?

92
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.380
I'm gonna cry, I'm crying already,
can you see the tears?

93
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.358
Just kidding, those are freckles.

94
00:05:15.358 --> 00:05:18.256
All right, we're good?

95
00:05:18.256 --> 00:05:22.340
We're good, what else?

96
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.900
A guide to pair programming, read this,
I think I'm talking for too long.

97
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.420
It's gonna be hard to talk all day for
six days, I know.

98
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.560
But you guys probably have to do this
at work most of the time anyway.

99
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.859
Does anyone pair program at work?

100
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.340
Yeah, so you're used to it.

101
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:39.750
You know what the deal is.

102
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.860
Communicate deliberately, be specific,

103
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.960
don't say, save this thing and
then loop through the thing.

104
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.530
And then, stuff and things.

105
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:52.060
Leave those general words at the door,

106
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.930
come in with specific
programming terminology.

107
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.860
It's okay for you to think for
a moment about, what's that word again?

108
00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.370
Yeah, you know?

109
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.966
You know, variable, or
the variable i, etc.

110
00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:06.022
One person is typing,
one person is talking,

111
00:06:06.022 --> 00:06:09.650
that's typical of pair programming.

112
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.060
The style that you wanna do is totally
up to you, but that's one style.

113
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:21.697
If you are online, codeshare.io,
invite someone online to do a co-chair.

114
00:06:21.697 --> 00:06:27.150
Co-chair who will hang out or whatever you
wanna do, that's gonna be really important

115
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.440
to keep you engaged, accountable and
doing the exercises.

116
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.970
Last but not least, be nice.

117
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.200
Don't say things like my god,
I can't believe you don't know.

118
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.512
Or you didn't know that thing?

119
00:06:40.512 --> 00:06:44.925
Just stop, come on,
it's not even necessary.

120
00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:47.420
And most importantly, have fun.

121
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.860
I know this is like an academic topic.

122
00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.830
But trust me, it can be fun.

123
00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.980
And I already have an idea for
an awesome board game.

124
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.510
It's like a Scooby Doo mystery data
structures algorithm board game.

125
00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:59.250
It's gonna be great.

126
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.030
Coming to stores near you, probably,
I don't know, probably never.

127
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.480
But it's here, and it can be fun.
