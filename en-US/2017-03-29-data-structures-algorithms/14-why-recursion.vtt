00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: A lot of people go
through their life using recursion based

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.630
on just memorizing a pattern of syntax.

3
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.098
But we're gonna explore
a little more in depth.

4
00:00:08.098 --> 00:00:08.799
Yeah.

5
00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.209
Cool.

6
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:14.420
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So what is recursion?

7
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.010
So a lot of us have used it, so

8
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.130
if I ask the question what is it,
perhaps we have an answer somewhere.

9
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When a method calls itself.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.590
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

11
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.360
Exactly.

12
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.280
You're reading my slide.

13
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.780
Look at that.

14
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.740
You like it?
Call me.

15
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.500
Call me anytime.

16
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.920
I just love it.

17
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.730
This is how I get through this,
just like, make my own silly jokes.

18
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.800
So recursion is simply when
a function calls itself, however,

19
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.870
it doesn't stop there.

20
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.230
No.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It will never stop.

21
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No, this one will
never actually stop, it'll infinitely be

22
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.108
calling you like a creepy stalker
until it gets a stack overflow.

23
00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:56.709
Cool, all right, so recursion defined
a function that calls itself.

24
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.560
That doesn't really
mean much to us though.

25
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.350
You know?
Because recursion is just a way of

26
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.590
approaching a problem.

27
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.970
It's a way to take a procedure
that's repeated over and over again.

28
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.430
It's like a loop.

29
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.550
A lot of the things that we use recursion
for, you can simply do with a loop.

30
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.230
Most of the time until you get,
well you can actually always do it but

31
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.370
it's a little more complicated.

32
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.177
You can always do it with a loop and
in, like, another data structure.

33
00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:32.074
A recursion with loop you can loop and
do some practice in the exercises

34
00:01:32.074 --> 00:01:36.890
translating loops while loops for
loops and two recursion.

35
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.380
Until we get to the point we're like,

36
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.206
wait, now it gets really hard
to make that translation.

37
00:01:42.206 --> 00:01:43.024
Yeah?

38
00:01:43.024 --> 00:01:44.548
All right.

39
00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:48.681
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Any questions so far?

40
00:01:56.412 --> 00:01:57.200
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.400
So right now we are going to
talk about recursive functions.

42
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.920
On tomorrow we are going to talk
about recursive algorithms.

43
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.602
And then when we get to trees and

44
00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:11.599
graphs we will talk about
recursive data structures.

45
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.381
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Here we go.

46
00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:17.490
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Why?

47
00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.470
Elegant solutions that keeps your
code DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself.

48
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.090
As opposed to WET: We Enjoy Typing.

49
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.960
It's expected Computer Science knowledge.

50
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.280
You're going to see these
on interviews a lot.

51
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.110
It's useful, especially for
specific data structures.

52
00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.430
You feel really cool after writing like
a really elegant recursive solution.

53
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.190
It's like this much,
this many lines of code and

54
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.590
then it does a lot of cool stuff, yeah.

55
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.600
This is exciting.

56
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.960
It's difficult for people to tackle at
first, so if this is your first time,

57
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.850
it's totally cool.

58
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.620
Slow me down.

59
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.500
Ask me lots of questions.

60
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.930
Happy to do that.

61
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.370
All right, everybody ready?

62
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.830
We're like at the top of
the rollercoaster like choo, choo, choo.

63
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.120
We're about to go into the recursion.
