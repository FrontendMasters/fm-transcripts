1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.130
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We talked a lot
about okay what is class gonna be like,

2
00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.610
how to be successful.

3
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.647
Here are some things that are some
failure patterns to be aware of.

4
00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:12.190
And I talked a little bit about okay
this is a super intimidating topic.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.670
A lot of people are afraid of it, and
I wanted just to throw it out there and

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.090
also to our live streamers,
what about, what is like.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.729
What goes through your head when you're
feeling nervous about data structures and

8
00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:28.532
algorithms?

9
00:00:28.532 --> 00:00:32.787
Like is this a scene, where like,
you're in an interview, and they're like,

10
00:00:32.787 --> 00:00:34.490
can you implement a hash table?

11
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.550
And then you start crying in
front of your interviewer, or

12
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.618
your interviewer just gets up and
says, you're stupid.

13
00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:45.246
Like what goes through your mind
that makes you feel nervous,

14
00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:47.242
Abby?
&gt;&gt; Abby: Honestly feel like,

15
00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:52.022
at least in my experience, and
I went to boot camp to learn how to code,

16
00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:54.470
and I have been working since then.

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:00.310
But, most of the time when people hear
that I don't have a CS background,

18
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.990
they try to like one up me.

19
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.660
And I'll talk about things like this that
I necessarily didn't get the education

20
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.560
for, and it's just frustrating,
like it just makes me kind of upset.

21
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.900
Because it's hard to try to have

22
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.050
a conversation with someone's who's
trying to justify why they're like

23
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.770
better than you because they know about.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Because they spend

24
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.580
like $60,000 on their education.
&gt;&gt; Abby: Yeah yeah

25
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.120
versus much less than that or
you didn't have that option right.

26
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.960
I went to a boot camp
right out of high school

27
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.410
just because it's the one
thing I could afford

28
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.400
to just get onto a career path quickly.

29
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's awesome.

30
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.700
&gt;&gt; Abby: Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's awesome.

31
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.540
Well pat on the back for that.

32
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.200
Going to a boot camp right out of high
school non easy feat, so whatever

33
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.530
&gt;&gt; Abby: It was reallly scary.

34
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.310
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

35
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.160
you're such a brave person.
&gt;&gt; Abby: Yeah I was one of

36
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.720
the only women around.

37
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.629
There weren't that many
women in the whole thing, so

38
00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:53.781
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

39
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:55.897
it's a whole different world, yeah.

40
00:01:55.897 --> 00:02:00.909
So it's just sort of like these people
who are sort of belittling you because

41
00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.070
of your lack of a formal CS background,
that can be uncomfortable, for sure.

42
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.325
What else,
what comes to your mind when I say,

43
00:02:10.325 --> 00:02:13.583
I'm gonna make you do
an algorithm right now?

44
00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.844
And then you get this feeling like my God,

45
00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:20.620
like do you have an image or
do you have a feeling?

46
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.049
What experience do you have?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: No one,

47
00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:29.197
no experiences?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I hear people saying stuff

48
00:02:29.197 --> 00:02:32.840
like n something, and
I don't know what it means,

49
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.879
but that pops in my head.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

50
00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.779
yeah, like o of n or something?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

51
00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:38.805
&gt;&gt; Abby: Like n plus 1 query?

52
00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:39.363
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:41.769
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] Yeah, so

54
00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.697
sort of like the math and the jargon
around this topic can be a little

55
00:02:46.697 --> 00:02:51.274
bit intimidating, and
make you feel like an outsider right.

56
00:02:51.274 --> 00:02:53.722
Like similar to what Abby was saying,

57
00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:58.488
it was like those people are in the know
and somehow we have all these fancy words.

58
00:02:58.488 --> 00:03:03.089
Which come to find out,
it's not that complicated, thank God.

59
00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:05.994
They're are little bit complicated but
we'll get through it,

60
00:03:05.994 --> 00:03:07.080
we'll get through it.

61
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.021
And, after this class we'll ll be in
the know together, so that's awesome.

62
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:14.029
Let's see, for David it's terror,

63
00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:19.570
David it's like stump the chump,
stump the chump, I get it.

64
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.370
I was like, I was thinking like trip for
some reason,

65
00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.370
I was like that doesn't make sense,
stump the chump.

66
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.836
So it's like, again, this idea that
people are trying to trick you so

67
00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:34.846
they seem smart, and you're just like
crying on the floor like I don't know.

68
00:03:34.846 --> 00:03:39.006
You have your rattle, and then they're
like ha-ha, you don't know anything about

69
00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:44.090
data structures and algorithms!
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anything else?

70
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That actually kind of

71
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.719
happened to me.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]

72
00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:50.157
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So I'd only done like two or

73
00:03:50.157 --> 00:03:56.108
three interviews, two interviews
maybe in the last eight years.

74
00:03:56.108 --> 00:03:59.079
Interviewing for a job,
one was for Netflix, and

75
00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.901
Netflix is very algorithms heavy.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

76
00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:02.432
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Sorry, data

77
00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:03.750
structures heavy.

78
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.966
And so, there's four of them and
they're all like,

79
00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:10.266
basically quizzing me on
how to implement something.

80
00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:14.082
That you can't do an array an object,
you have to use like, a link list or

81
00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:15.834
whatever and I was just like, and

82
00:04:15.834 --> 00:04:18.278
do it on the white board, of course.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

83
00:04:18.278 --> 00:04:18.912
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Of course.

84
00:04:18.912 --> 00:04:20.242
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Because that is really

85
00:04:20.242 --> 00:04:25.213
going to show you how well you can code on
a keyboard right, it's on the white board.

86
00:04:25.213 --> 00:04:27.318
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I it's just like to put you

87
00:04:27.318 --> 00:04:31.912
on the most stressful situation and
see how you respond or

88
00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:35.757
something, I don't know it's really weird.

89
00:04:35.757 --> 00:04:40.207
That was actually Jaffer who
actually taught our courses,

90
00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:42.928
he was in that room.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: He made you cry?

91
00:04:42.928 --> 00:04:45.014
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yap, Jaffer made me cry.

92
00:04:45.014 --> 00:04:46.376
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH]

93
00:04:47.957 --> 00:04:48.755
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay one more and

94
00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:55.303
then I'll leave you alone.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I don't know, I guess,

95
00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:59.938
what I have a feeling with algorithms and
data structures is that there are often

96
00:04:59.938 --> 00:05:04.640
a lot of different words that mean almost
exactly the same thing and so my terror is

97
00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.293
I'm gonna use the wrong word, like I say.
&gt;&gt; Abby: Yeah.

98
00:05:07.293 --> 00:05:10.335
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: A hash table, and no that's

99
00:05:10.335 --> 00:05:15.158
an associative array or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, or a dictionary,

100
00:05:15.158 --> 00:05:18.693
a hash map, what's the difference,
is there a difference, yeah totally.

101
00:05:18.693 --> 00:05:22.309
So again this like being an outsider and

102
00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:27.490
not knowing the vocabulary
of the cool kids, right?

103
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.916
I think it's a centum of the cool kids,
nothing cool and then like,

104
00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:36.590
trying to like milk what they have for
that moment in these interviews.

105
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.580
Most interviewers are not like that,
most interviewers are gonna be rooting for

106
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.940
you or
just like kind of mutually disengage.

107
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.970
Because they're like,
I wanna be coding right now,

108
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.710
but recruiters are making
me interview you.

109
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.504
And I do need help on this project, so
it would be nice if this time that I'm

110
00:05:55.504 --> 00:05:58.397
spending talking to you for
an hour and I'm not coding.

111
00:05:58.397 --> 00:06:02.359
Would result in having someone
on the team that can help me,

112
00:06:02.359 --> 00:06:05.212
meet these crazy deadlines that you know,

113
00:06:05.212 --> 00:06:08.411
we have to do, does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And

114
00:06:08.411 --> 00:06:12.767
I would reckon that if that's the culture
that they're setting up in the interview,

115
00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:16.532
then you might not wanna participate
in that and join the company anyway.

116
00:06:16.532 --> 00:06:17.078
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

117
00:06:17.078 --> 00:06:18.720
yeah, absolutely.

118
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.277
So, part of an interview
you're interviewing them, and

119
00:06:21.277 --> 00:06:23.991
if their culture seems really
intimidating and exclusive and

120
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:29.482
like you have to hop through all of these,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Different hoops,

121
00:06:29.482 --> 00:06:32.580
then it might not be the kind of
environment that you wanna be.

122
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.526
Some people like that,
some people are really into it,

123
00:06:35.526 --> 00:06:39.720
they like the challenge and there's
different strokes for different folks.

124
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.997
But, I don't think that most
places are gonna be like that, but

125
00:06:44.997 --> 00:06:50.372
we do have this idea of this like
person who's like kind of smug and

126
00:06:50.372 --> 00:06:56.182
like maybe mean, [LAUGH] and this is
there to like make you feel stupid.

127
00:06:56.182 --> 00:07:00.809
And for the most part that's
not their intention, so,

128
00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:07.024
we have all these ideas and it's usually
not gonna be like that hopefully.

129
00:07:07.024 --> 00:07:10.324
And if not, you probably don't wanna
work there, at the end of the day,

130
00:07:10.324 --> 00:07:13.170
all interviewing is just
a learning experience, right?

131
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.970
Whether it goes good or bad or who knows,
they just never e-mail you back and

132
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:19.998
you don't know what happened.

133
00:07:19.998 --> 00:07:23.872
You just learned either what you didn't
know or you solved a new problem or

134
00:07:23.872 --> 00:07:26.070
you solved a problem that you knew again.

135
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.555
So cool, all right well thank you for
that thought experiment.

136
00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:33.379
Cuz I'm really trying to
learn from you all, so

137
00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:36.073
you guys are studying, I'm also studying.

138
00:07:36.073 --> 00:07:37.950
And I'm gonna learn from you all,

139
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.927
what is it that stops you from
jumping off that cliff and

140
00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:45.148
doing the exercises cuz that's something
I see over and over and over again.

141
00:07:45.148 --> 00:07:49.631
People who take my workshops and
I see them later, and they're like yeah,

142
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:53.351
I wish I did the exercises,
cuz I would understand it better.

143
00:07:53.351 --> 00:07:55.283
So I'm just trying to
understand the psychology.

144
00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:58.926
I'm not a psychologist, but
it's very fascinating to me.

145
00:07:58.926 --> 00:08:00.450
Awesome, well, thank you.

146
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:03.341
Okay, object oriented JavaScript.

147
00:08:03.341 --> 00:08:07.910
We have some big long words, god,
on the screen, pseudoclassical.

148
00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.830
So before we even look at the slide,

149
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:18.672
what do I wanna say?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We are,

150
00:08:18.672 --> 00:08:23.152
before we even look at this big word and
what it means,

151
00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:29.735
we're going to just explore,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just

152
00:08:29.735 --> 00:08:35.270
the idea of data structures really quick,
what's a data structure exactly, I forgot.

153
00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.204
I have these like periodic bouts of
amnesia, if you guys have taken classes

154
00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:43.458
with me before it's just like, I'll say
something then I'll totally forget.

155
00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:47.742
And then I need my friends to help me,
that's all of you,

156
00:08:47.742 --> 00:08:49.721
you saw my picture right?

157
00:08:49.721 --> 00:08:55.954
With us in the kitchen together, it's me
and all my friends and we're cooking.

158
00:08:55.954 --> 00:08:59.632
And I'm just like, and
back to the scooby doo analogy,

159
00:08:59.632 --> 00:09:01.829
like I'm not Velma here, okay?

160
00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:06.664
I'm Fred, who's gonna like try my
best to take you down the wrong way.

161
00:09:06.664 --> 00:09:10.095
But might be good intentionally wrong, and

162
00:09:10.095 --> 00:09:13.812
then you have to come in and
save the day, yeah?

163
00:09:13.812 --> 00:09:19.552
So what do we think is a data structure?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Give it a guess,

164
00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:23.097
I haven't even told you yet.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: A way of organizing data?

165
00:09:23.097 --> 00:09:23.981
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, it's a way of

166
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:29.641
organizing your data, for sure.
&gt;&gt; Abby: I think

167
00:09:29.641 --> 00:09:34.152
of types of data that are allowed in it?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, yeah, so

168
00:09:34.152 --> 00:09:38.227
there's some rules probably about
how you organize your data,

169
00:09:38.227 --> 00:09:44.070
it could be related to the type.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Do offers from the chat

170
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.590
room as structured to contain data?

171
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:47.688
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: A schema.

172
00:09:47.688 --> 00:09:49.201
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, absolutely,

173
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:53.749
so, the Internet, which is where
we all live and work, right?

174
00:09:53.749 --> 00:09:56.129
We all live and
work on the Internet, yeah.

175
00:09:56.129 --> 00:10:00.726
Full of data, right, can we imagine
a world, just close your eyes,

176
00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.726
with no data on the Internet?

177
00:10:02.726 --> 00:10:05.766
What would it look like?
&gt;&gt; Abby: It would be boring.

178
00:10:05.766 --> 00:10:06.684
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I don't even know,

179
00:10:06.684 --> 00:10:10.032
it's like that's even beyond my,
I have a pretty good imagination, and

180
00:10:10.032 --> 00:10:11.439
it's beyond my imagination.

181
00:10:11.439 --> 00:10:14.145
So the data, so the data.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Got a good one here.

182
00:10:14.145 --> 00:10:14.683
&gt;&gt; Abby: Yeah?

183
00:10:14.683 --> 00:10:15.792
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: A container for

184
00:10:15.792 --> 00:10:19.364
data that fits different needs.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I like that, yeah,

185
00:10:19.364 --> 00:10:23.460
that's definitely in the realm
of what a data structure is.

186
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:27.328
But back to why data is important, why we
have to structure our data is because we

187
00:10:27.328 --> 00:10:31.164
live and work on the Internet, which
is based basically just on data, right?

188
00:10:31.164 --> 00:10:38.079
If we can imagine the internet without
data, how could we, 1993, I like that.

189
00:10:38.079 --> 00:10:44.260
What was I gonna say?

190
00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.680
Imagine a world without data,
data structure.

191
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.177
We have to structure our data cuz
there's so much data out there,

192
00:10:50.177 --> 00:10:52.287
and we need to do stuff with it, right.

193
00:10:52.287 --> 00:10:54.739
Like one of the things
that we do with our data?

194
00:10:54.739 --> 00:10:57.860
We take pictures on our cats on
Instagram we post it up, right?

195
00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.772
We have friends on Facebook,
maybe we're on fallen masters

196
00:11:02.772 --> 00:11:08.087
watching live stream of the data
instruction algorithms class.

197
00:11:08.087 --> 00:11:11.252
Coincidentally maybe that is
something you're doing, right now.

198
00:11:11.252 --> 00:11:16.382
All of these things require data,
these things require data to be

199
00:11:16.382 --> 00:11:21.900
processes at increasing speeds as
the Internet grows and data grows.

200
00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.845
And all the different cool things you can
do on the Internet grows you need to be

201
00:11:26.845 --> 00:11:29.753
able to take that data,
and do stuff with it.

202
00:11:29.753 --> 00:11:33.826
Right and I'm saying do stuff right now
because there's a lot of different things

203
00:11:33.826 --> 00:11:37.500
that we're gonna be doing with our
data through the next six days, yeah.

204
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:45.640
So, we're gonna have a structure
to our data structures okay?

205
00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.947
So were gonna have
an underlining structure, and

206
00:11:48.947 --> 00:11:52.590
we're gonna do it in
object-oriented style, okay?

207
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.601
Take it back to slide
object Oriented JavaScript,

208
00:11:57.601 --> 00:12:02.960
so we are going to use classes
to keep our data structure

209
00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:08.215
sort of syntax and
formatting inconsistent, yeah.

210
00:12:08.215 --> 00:12:11.179
It's an industry standard way of doing it,
and

211
00:12:11.179 --> 00:12:14.080
we'll go specifically
into what that means.

212
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.980
We're gonna be using classes to make
instances of our data structure, so

213
00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.221
a class you can kinda think
of it like this is a factory,

214
00:12:19.221 --> 00:12:20.800
you might have heard that word before.

215
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.498
It's like a factory that creates little
stamps of your data structures right, and

216
00:12:25.498 --> 00:12:27.979
you can just think into
your mind right now,

217
00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:31.300
a data structure could be
a picture of a molecule, right.

218
00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:36.053
So we have a factory or
we call it a constructor and we're make

219
00:12:36.053 --> 00:12:41.305
little widgets of data structures,
so that we can just do that.

220
00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:45.094
And we'll have a consistent way
of doing that across the class,

221
00:12:45.094 --> 00:12:48.196
there are other ways to
make classes in JavaScript.

222
00:12:48.196 --> 00:12:51.099
We're just gonna talk
about pseudoclassical,

223
00:12:51.099 --> 00:12:54.930
it's gonna be expected in most
JavaScript interviews, yeah.

224
00:12:56.470 --> 00:13:01.800
Cool, so the trouble is that
until recent not until recently

225
00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:05.910
JavaScript didn't have like
a formal way of creating classes.

226
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.830
Most languages that give you a class key
word, and then you're good to go, right

227
00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:15.020
and you have maybe some different types
of things that you could do with it but,

228
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:20.741
simple, you say, keyword class perhaps,
and then you're good to go.

229
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:24.710
JavaScript it's not that easy, so

230
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.250
we're gonna go slow and
it's a little bit messy.

231
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:34.047
ES6 or ES2015 whatever we call it
these days, like Equiscript 2015,

232
00:13:34.047 --> 00:13:35.881
2016?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: 2015

233
00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:37.789
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: 2015, thank you.

234
00:13:37.789 --> 00:13:41.012
Does have a class key word but
we're not gonna dive into that.

235
00:13:41.012 --> 00:13:46.450
You can reference the interweb for
more information regarding that.
