1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.762
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're gonna do
some pseudocode for our delete node.

2
00:00:06.762 --> 00:00:08.840
Delete node.

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.780
It's gonna take a value.

4
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.960
What's the first thing we gotta do?

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.145
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We should see
if the stop value is equal to

6
00:00:21.145 --> 00:00:21.703
the
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

7
00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:22.860
what's that in pseudocode?

8
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.680
That sounds like code.

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.230
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: sorry.
See if this is the node to delete.

10
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.560
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
basically, search for the node.

11
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.238
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

12
00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:43.467
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,
and how we could do

13
00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:48.447
that is check if current

14
00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:54.423
value equals value, yeah?

15
00:00:54.423 --> 00:00:57.791
Cool, what's the next thing?

16
00:01:01.142 --> 00:01:03.455
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we're searching for the node,

17
00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:06.260
we're checking if it equals the value.

18
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.930
So we have two paths
that we can take here.

19
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.230
A binary tree, if you will, of options.

20
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:21.060
Either it's true, the current
value is the value, or it's not.

21
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.259
So what do we do in each of those cases?

22
00:01:31.562 --> 00:01:35.955
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: If it is,
then that's the one we wanna delete.

23
00:01:35.955 --> 00:01:41.049
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If so,
maybe we'll just call delete on it.

24
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.640
Like that and
then we can put in different function.

25
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.140
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Okay.

26
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.640
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or we can do search.

27
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.440
We could just take it out, okay?

28
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.398
Else what?

29
00:02:01.398 --> 00:02:02.769
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Keep looking.

30
00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:13.060
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right, maybe
a recursive call to this search function.

31
00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.209
Cool, all right.

32
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.740
So that's one thing that we have to do.

33
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.920
So let's write our delete function,
takes a val.

34
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.440
What's our edge case that
we were discussing earlier?

35
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.350
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Trying to
delete the parent or

36
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.200
trying to delete a node with two children?

37
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.490
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The edge
case was deleting the root.

38
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, sorry,
that's what I meant.

39
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.580
There is no parent root.

40
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if it's a root,
we have to do some other stuff.

41
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.662
Else it's not the root.

42
00:03:05.662 --> 00:03:06.790
Then what do we do?

43
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: If it's a leaf, then
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Check if it is a leaf.

44
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.495
If so,-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I guess my question is

45
00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:25.560
we need access to the parent still, right?

46
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Maybe.

47
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.810
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: We do, so
we need to be passing the parent.

48
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.589
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, and

49
00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:38.625
also depends on,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

50
00:03:38.625 --> 00:03:41.475
let's just pass, that would be easier.

51
00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:48.170
So delete,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And we'll say current.

52
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.092
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right, so
current is gonna be the parent.

53
00:03:57.423 --> 00:04:02.110
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, okay.

54
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.415
So we're gonna check if it's a leaf.

55
00:04:03.415 --> 00:04:10.142
If so, what do we do?

56
00:04:10.142 --> 00:04:11.398
Miranda do you know?

57
00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.000
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You
can pass if you don't.

58
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.030
&gt;&gt; Miranda: Yeah, let's pass,
[INAUDIBLE] [LAUGH]

59
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, no worries.

60
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.168
Rosie?

61
00:04:29.768 --> 00:04:30.647
&gt;&gt; Rosie: Pass.

62
00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:31.801
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pass, okay.

63
00:04:34.077 --> 00:04:36.211
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see, David.

64
00:04:36.211 --> 00:04:39.290
&gt;&gt; David: Well I was coding I guess,
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.010
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: It's okay.

66
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.170
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: If it's
a leaf we can just delete it, right?

67
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.790
We don't have to worry about
the children's, cuz it doesn't have any?

68
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.764
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Unknown Female Student: But you have to

69
00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:47.268
figure out if it's to the right or

70
00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:50.235
to the left of the parent that
you're removing the pointer from.

71
00:04:55.081 --> 00:04:56.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So delete it.

72
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:04.870
Some things to consider when we're
deleting it is which pointer do we swap?

73
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.440
Since, for this case it could be left or
the right.

74
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.920
For our min max, it was either always
a left or is always the right, right?

75
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.352
Cuz the minimum is always
gonna be on the left,

76
00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:20.879
maximum is always gonna be on the right,
cool.

77
00:05:22.844 --> 00:05:23.941
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right.

78
00:05:27.688 --> 00:05:31.354
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then we,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We actually just gonna

79
00:05:31.354 --> 00:05:32.130
make a null, right?

80
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.260
We're not gonna be swapping at this point,
cool.

81
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.780
Okay, so check if it is a leaf.

82
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.710
If it is, we're gonna delete it.

83
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.160
Something to think about when
we're implementing this is

84
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.300
how do we know if it's the left or
the right?

85
00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.170
&gt;&gt; Unknown Female Student: You'd check
the parents, children, basically,

86
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.000
and see which one it's equal to.

87
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.783
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
so you could just check.

88
00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:05.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So you could say,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If

89
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.761
the parent's left equals the value,

90
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.470
then set that one, for example.

91
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.740
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Equals this,
right?

92
00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.004
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hm?
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Equals this?

93
00:06:19.004 --> 00:06:21.956
&gt;&gt; Unknown Female Student: Yeah,
equals this.

94
00:06:21.956 --> 00:06:24.092
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: I
used the pseudocode.

95
00:06:24.092 --> 00:06:26.864
&gt;&gt; Unknown Female Student: I mean,
you could either compare the parent's left

96
00:06:26.864 --> 00:06:31.250
value with the value, or the parent's
left node and the node, right?

97
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.530
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You can't compare
the nodes, So it has to be the value.

98
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.070
&gt;&gt; Unknown Female Student: Okay.

99
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.570
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

100
00:06:36.801 --> 00:06:37.866
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

101
00:06:40.171 --> 00:06:41.370
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Anything else?

102
00:06:45.492 --> 00:06:48.283
&gt;&gt; Unknown Female Student: If
it has one child.

103
00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:50.917
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

104
00:06:50.917 --> 00:06:55.970
case one if it's the root.

105
00:06:57.396 --> 00:07:02.736
Sorry, case one if it's the leaf,

106
00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:07.627
right
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Just

107
00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:10.973
putting that so we know.

108
00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:14.110
Here's our case one.

109
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.302
Great, all right.

110
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:23.293
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Case two.

111
00:07:27.028 --> 00:07:28.129
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Has one node.

112
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.330
Is a leaf, right?

113
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.840
Is a elaf.

114
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.798
Is a leaf, okay.

115
00:07:34.798 --> 00:07:41.408
So check if you know the current

116
00:07:41.408 --> 00:07:47.009
node has a left or a right.

117
00:07:52.736 --> 00:07:53.950
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then what do we do?

118
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.660
Andy do you know?

119
00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:01.210
&gt;&gt; Andy: So you've checked
if it has a left or a right.

120
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.579
Whichever one it does have.

121
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.770
You wanna set that one.

122
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.981
So if it has a left then,
&gt;&gt; Andy: You

123
00:08:14.981 --> 00:08:19.355
wanna set that to the parent's left side?

124
00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:20.750
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We
can look at the picture.

125
00:08:26.365 --> 00:08:29.693
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where
is our picture here?

126
00:08:29.693 --> 00:08:33.423
So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Imagining there's no

127
00:08:33.423 --> 00:08:34.145
25 here.

128
00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:34.940
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Uh-huh.

129
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.070
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And
we're gonna delete 20?

130
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.080
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Yeah.

131
00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.190
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What
we wanna do is have 18.

132
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.210
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Yes.

133
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.171
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Be to the right-.

134
00:08:43.171 --> 00:08:44.211
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Of the parent.

135
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.539
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Of the parent, right?

136
00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:47.580
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Yes.

137
00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:52.708
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And does it have to
do with actually the fact that 18 is on

138
00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:54.260
the left?

139
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.220
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: No.

140
00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.050
&gt;&gt; Unknown Female Student: It
doesn't matter where 18 is,

141
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.740
it matters where 20 is to [INAUDIBLE] 15.

142
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:01.202
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if we didn't have

143
00:09:01.202 --> 00:09:04.546
18,
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Yeah,

144
00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:07.760
we would still be setting
the right of the parent.

145
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.390
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, got it.

146
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.590
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: So
did we have a step already where we found

147
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.220
our current node's
relationship to the parent?

148
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.556
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's see,
I don't remember anymore.

149
00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.141
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Where's
our pseudocode?

150
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:27.570
Okay, yeah, I know.

151
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:31.698
We're checking if the current
node is left or right, but

152
00:09:31.698 --> 00:09:36.092
we're not actually checking
the parent's relationship.

153
00:09:36.092 --> 00:09:38.286
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: You
may need to do that.

154
00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.086
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Should
we do that first?

155
00:09:40.086 --> 00:09:42.508
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Yeah, probably.

156
00:09:42.508 --> 00:09:43.669
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Like, here?

157
00:09:45.196 --> 00:09:53.748
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So.

158
00:09:53.748 --> 00:09:56.520
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: We could do
that like above the switch, right?

159
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:58.772
Somewhere, cuz we'll need
that info in every case.

160
00:09:58.772 --> 00:10:02.981
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

161
00:10:02.981 --> 00:10:07.584
maybe If it's not a root, right?

162
00:10:07.584 --> 00:10:08.288
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Yeah.

163
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.416
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.

164
00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:21.055
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,
set relationship from parent, right?

165
00:10:23.924 --> 00:10:27.170
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we want to know if
it was coming from the left or the right.

166
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:33.400
Because it's gonna inform where
our next node will be, right?

167
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:36.657
And we can use that in this step for
example.

168
00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.450
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, all right.

169
00:10:46.864 --> 00:10:48.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if it has a left,

170
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:57.118
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then set the left

171
00:10:57.118 --> 00:11:01.599
to the
&gt;&gt; Unknown Male Student: Parent's

172
00:11:01.599 --> 00:11:04.650
relationship side or
whatever you wanna call it.

173
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:10.285
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Parent's relationship

174
00:11:10.285 --> 00:11:14.847
to be deleted node.
