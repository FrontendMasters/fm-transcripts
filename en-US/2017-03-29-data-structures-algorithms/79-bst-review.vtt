00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.660
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we're in day four.

2
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.960
We're gonna review a little bit
about binary source trees only so

3
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.440
that we can get to deleting our nodes.

4
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.460
Then we're gonna get started with graphs.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.020
That's today.

6
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.710
Tomorrow we're gonna do some hash tables.

7
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.740
It's Saturday, we're gonna decide
a little bit later if we're gonna

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.650
have a half day or a full day tomorrow,
just depending on sort of attendance.

9
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.420
It's been a long six days.

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.910
So Mark'll be sending out surveys,
seeing who's planning on coming.

11
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.210
For those of you who are here or
in the chat,

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.130
I just wanna take sort of
an informal survey really quick.

13
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.400
Who is gonna be here tomorrow?

14
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.040
Raise your hand.

15
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.790
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, okay.

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.330
So most of the people.

17
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.420
Cool, okay.

18
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.630
And we'll definitely be
covering hash tables tomorrow.

19
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Beyond that,
we're still sort of TBD.

20
00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:05.250
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool, so if you have
any strong opinions on what you wanna see,

21
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.541
talk to me and I can,
be prepared for me to maybe say no,

22
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:14.478
but let me know and we can think about it.

23
00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:14.978
Cool.

24
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.680
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Awesome.

25
00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:24.630
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Ready to go?

26
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.640
Let's do this.

27
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.270
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Let's just start
from the beginning for a second.

28
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.850
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
binary search trees.

29
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.100
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What is it?

30
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.900
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What
is a binary search tree?

31
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.550
Rosie, do you remember?

32
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.420
Where you here yesterday?

33
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.390
&gt;&gt; Rosie: I wasn't.

34
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.880
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay, how about Jen?

35
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.910
&gt;&gt; Jen: Trees with only two children.

36
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.900
Maximum of two children each.

37
00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.952
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: David,

38
00:01:59.952 --> 00:02:04.180
do you know some more rules for
a binary search tree?

39
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.840
&gt;&gt; David: Well, the rule is that every

40
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.970
node in the left subtree has to
be less than the current node.

41
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.920
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: And every node in
the right subtree has to be greater than

42
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.480
the current node.

43
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.270
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, absolutely, cool.

44
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.950
So there we are.

45
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.720
Some things that we did is we traversed
them in different orders, in order,

46
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.350
preorder, post order.

47
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.670
We inserted, we searched for things, and

48
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.420
then we started to talk
about deleting nodes.

49
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.120
And it seemed fine for a moment, right?

50
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.910
We first deleted three,
and we're like, cool.

51
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.790
We just set the parents left to null,
right?

52
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.710
When we're deleting the minimum.

53
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:51.940
We're like, that's cool.

54
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.790
And then, we left off with, okay,
so the next run of this method,

55
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.270
deleting five,
presents a different challenge, right?

56
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:10.108
And so, we left off with, so
how do we account for that?

57
00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:17.310
How do we account for
a sub-tree here, being longer, right?

58
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.440
We have a balanced tree,
but what if it wasn't?

59
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.020
Does it matter?

60
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.630
Does it change anything?

61
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.189
So that's where we left off.

62
00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.130
And I asked you

63
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.677
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What do we do?

64
00:03:36.677 --> 00:03:38.992
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If you had to guess,
Andy,

65
00:03:38.992 --> 00:03:44.890
what would you guess we would do,
just by looking at this?

66
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.310
&gt;&gt; Andy: So instead of to delete,
say we were deleting 5.

67
00:03:55.776 --> 00:03:59.360
&gt;&gt; Andy: I mean, it has two child nodes,
so it wouldn't really work.

68
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.970
But I was thinking if it only had one
child node instead of nulling out

69
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.040
the parents child,
you could set the child to the grandchild?

70
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.550
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,
so for the minimum, right?

71
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.650
If 5 was the minimum,
it would have no left.

72
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.870
So there wouldn't be two child.

73
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.010
&gt;&gt; Andy: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So it would only have

74
00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.550
a maximum of one.

75
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.330
Otherwise we would,
if we're deleting the minimum, right?

76
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.630
Otherwise we'd just delete the left.

77
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.494
So that's part of the requirement here.

78
00:04:28.494 --> 00:04:30.220
&gt;&gt; Andy: Okay, so that would work, then.

79
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.030
So instead of just nulling out 7's left,
you could set 7's left equal to 6.

80
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.530
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep.
