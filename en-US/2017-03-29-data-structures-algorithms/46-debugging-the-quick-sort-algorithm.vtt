WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.040
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now that
we have reviewed the concept,

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.950
let's check our pseudocode and
make sure it matches.

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.200
So what's the first thing
that we need to do?

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.410
If you want me to erase this whole
thing and we can start from scratch?

5
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.919
Or you wanna edit it?

6
00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:15.160
It's always harder to debug?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Erase it.

7
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.282
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: You wanna erase it and

8
00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:16.970
start over?

9
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.900
Just know in real life you can't
always erase it and start over.

10
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.050
But, since I like you,
we can do it that way.

11
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.054
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Well, first of all,

12
00:00:27.054 --> 00:00:31.390
I think you only need an array as
an argument because you're gonna set

13
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.481
the pivot point and pivot location.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well, so because it's

14
00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:37.698
gonna be recursive, it's gonna change.

15
00:00:37.698 --> 00:00:38.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right, okay.

16
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.180
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And you're always

17
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.370
gonna pass the entire array every time.

18
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.560
That's why we do it that way.

19
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.497
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

20
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.984
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I forgot what order I

21
00:00:45.984 --> 00:00:54.034
had things in.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That's about right.

22
00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:55.240
It's good enough.
I'm missing one.

23
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.340
Should we put the 6 here?

24
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.588
Is that a good spot for it?

25
00:01:01.588 --> 00:01:04.165
Okay, so here's our original.

26
00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:05.950
We're gonna erase that one.

27
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.210
Okay, so
tell me what is the first thing we need to

28
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.319
do?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We

29
00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.960
have to initialize a couple things, right?

30
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.080
What are those things?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Pivot location and

31
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.588
the pivot?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right,

32
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:26.886
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So our pivot location,

33
00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.463
we're gonna start it at lo,

34
00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:34.347
which is gonna be zero at the beginning.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Pivot,

35
00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:37.590
you guys didn't even say it.

36
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.115
Well.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

37
00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:38.990
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I'll pretend

38
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.860
like you did.

39
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.210
Someone whispered it,
I heard it in their mind.

40
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.070
Okay, so we did some initializations here.

41
00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.040
We have our pivot is gonna be 4 and

42
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.140
our pivot location just
initializes at the beginning.

43
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.520
We're good?

44
00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.486
So what's the first thing we need to do?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: I know some

45
00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:07.210
people did the pseudocode cuz I saw it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Did you do a loop?

46
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.359
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

47
00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.420
loop through what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The length of

48
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.260
the array.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Loop.

49
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: From lo to hi.

50
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: From lo to hi,

51
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.452
why?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cuz that's the chunk of

52
00:02:26.452 --> 00:02:30.930
the array that we're gonna be sorting, so.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay.

53
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In the beginning it's 0

54
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.570
to the end, so
we're gonna sort the whole thing.

55
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.480
But as we go down recursively
it'll be like, from 0 to 5 or

56
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.144
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Okay,

57
00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:41.361
we'll go from there.

58
00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:47.247
So let's say we loop from
the beginning to the top.

59
00:02:47.247 --> 00:02:52.784
What are we gonna do in every loop?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We're gonna

60
00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:57.769
compare hi to the-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Compare

61
00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.305
the pivot.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right,

62
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:05.521
to,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The like, yeah, r sub i,

63
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:11.220
whatever the index is.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Right,

64
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.710
cuz you wanna, we're gonna keep
track of the pivot location, right?

65
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.520
Which is the beginning.

66
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.170
Starts at the beginning.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Should pivot be hi, or

67
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.570
should it be array?

68
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.322
High index of array?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hi is

69
00:03:29.322 --> 00:03:34.394
the last.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We

70
00:03:34.394 --> 00:03:35.902
can like-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But

71
00:03:35.902 --> 00:03:39.749
are those numbers integers or are they-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

72
00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:42.665
they're indices.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: They're both indices?

73
00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:43.970
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

74
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.470
Well, this one shouldn't be.

75
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.920
Yeah, that one shouldn't be.

76
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.820
Good catch.

77
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.616
So we wanted that one to be the value,
or actually-

78
00:03:54.616 --> 00:03:56.172
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: You could use indices and

79
00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:58.640
just compare in-
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

80
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.154
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The indexed array or

81
00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:03.550
that way, it's like it doesn't matter.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

82
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.285
it doesn't really matter.

83
00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:07.250
You just have to be able to compare.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: If you do it as an index,

84
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.603
then the comparison would be
array at pivot to array at

85
00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:12.582
pivotLoc.

86
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.192
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So it's-

87
00:04:16.192 --> 00:04:17.034
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Also we have to,

88
00:04:17.034 --> 00:04:19.240
we'd have to update it every time.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yep.

89
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.183
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So if we just save

90
00:04:22.183 --> 00:04:25.765
the value we can just compare it directly.

91
00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:31.036
But it can get tricky if we had doubles,
right, something to keep in mind.

92
00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:34.252
Well, let's pretend we don't,
let's make our life easy.

93
00:04:34.252 --> 00:04:39.632
Cool, so we are comparing our pivot value

94
00:04:39.632 --> 00:04:47.460
to the value at our pivot location.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

95
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.100
so we compare 4 to 3.

96
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.940
Now what happens?

97
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.550
3 is less than 4.

98
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.982
What does that mean for us?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So it definitely means

99
00:04:59.982 --> 00:05:04.850
we need to increment the pivot location.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, and

100
00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.490
that's because our pivot location,
everything to the left needs to be less.

101
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.780
So we know if we increment it to 1,

102
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.790
we now have,
we meet part of that criteria, right?

103
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.310
So we're moving closer to
where we wanted to be.

104
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:24.575
So if our, what were we saying,

105
00:05:24.575 --> 00:05:30.620
our pivot is greater than our current

106
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:38.609
item here,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What are we gonna do?

107
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.151
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Someone who didn't,

108
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:46.167
how about Jen?

109
00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:51.254
What are we gonna do?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

110
00:05:51.254 --> 00:05:55.897
we just discovered that our
pivot is greater than our

111
00:05:55.897 --> 00:06:00.710
3.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So then we increment

112
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.906
the pivot location.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yep, awesome.

113
00:06:12.026 --> 00:06:13.000
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What about our

114
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.759
else?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: What

115
00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:19.750
happens in the else?

116
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.960
So great, we did that.

117
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.615
We looked, and then we move.

118
00:06:24.615 --> 00:06:26.800
Our pivot location is now 1.

119
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.061
So I'll just keep this here.

120
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:39.490
So this is a value, and this is the index.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We're looping maybe.

121
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.940
Okay, so we compared it.

122
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.704
We incremented our pivot location,

123
00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:49.302
now it's 1.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Now we're gonna loop

124
00:06:49.302 --> 00:06:54.206
again.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, let's say,

125
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.984
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All right, so

126
00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:01.950
now we're at index 1, true?

127
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:10.130
So at index 1 we compare 7 to 4 and
it's not less.

128
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:16.034
So what do we do when 7 is greater then 4?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We swap around.

129
00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:16.866
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Swap them,

130
00:07:16.866 --> 00:07:22.460
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we, whoa, swap.

131
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.620
You guys read caps as yelling?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.

132
00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:29.160
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Swap the pivot.

133
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.870
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I would be so

134
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.504
annoyed if you typed
all of that uppercase.

135
00:07:32.504 --> 00:07:37.879
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: With pivot.

136
00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:41.540
Do you guys know what I mean when I say
the item, swap pivot location item?

137
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.930
Or maybe I'll make it a little more clear.

138
00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.350
We'll say array at the pivot
location with pivot, okay?

139
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.980
So that means that we swap 7 with 4.

140
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.850
Great, that's not exactly what we want,
right?

141
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.449
Then what do we need to do?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: How about our two

142
00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:05.720
gentlemen, Maurice and John?

143
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.198
I know you guys know.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Swap 5 and

144
00:08:11.198 --> 00:08:15.259
4.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, so swap

145
00:08:15.259 --> 00:08:21.953
the pivot with,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: The end

146
00:08:21.953 --> 00:08:22.999
of the array, right?

147
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.050
Something like that.

148
00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.434
Maybe this one needs to- Okay, we say-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: In every case it's not going

149
00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:35.528
to be that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so

150
00:08:35.528 --> 00:08:42.120
maybe that needs to change a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So we'll make a note.

151
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.071
Maybe we need to track this somewhere.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But

152
00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:51.121
don't you think, if it's minus 1,
the only way it's going

153
00:08:51.121 --> 00:08:55.878
to get to this point is if
the number before it is higher, so

154
00:08:55.878 --> 00:09:01.672
we'll have to switch with that one.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: But never mind.

155
00:09:01.672 --> 00:09:07.086
[INAUDIBLE] I don't know
if I need these or not.

156
00:09:07.086 --> 00:09:09.712
So carry, subtract one, and

157
00:09:09.712 --> 00:09:14.649
then kind of subtract another
one after you do the swap,

158
00:09:14.649 --> 00:09:19.278
so kind of keep a count on that.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so that could be

159
00:09:19.278 --> 00:09:23.270
useful for us to keep track of the pivot
location and not the pivot value.

160
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:29.289
So we can increment it, or we can,
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We can say

161
00:09:29.289 --> 00:09:31.859
this is pivot and
this is the pivot value or

162
00:09:31.859 --> 00:09:36.543
something.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

163
00:09:36.543 --> 00:09:37.870
then we can update this every time.

164
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.190
That's one way to do it.

165
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.740
Are you guys following here?

166
00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.810
So you just need to keep
track of that somehow.

167
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.610
I don't care how you do it.

168
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:54.698
Cool, what else do we need to do?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Shall

169
00:09:54.698 --> 00:09:56.120
we run our code and see if it works?

170
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.923
Run it in our brains?

171
00:09:58.923 --> 00:10:03.230
Okay, so
let's just keep going from where we were.

172
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.910
So we're at 4,

173
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:11.350
we're gonna loop again, we're gonna
compare the pivot to our pivot location.

174
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.120
Again, our pivot location
is in the same place.

175
00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:17.750
We haven't incremented it yet
so we're still at 1.

176
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:21.800
So pivot location, is it less?

177
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.320
No, it's not.

178
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.240
So we're gonna do this case.

179
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.380
We're gonna swap 4 with 5, and

180
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.969
then we're gonna swap 1 with

181
00:10:33.969 --> 00:10:38.400
4.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool,

182
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.296
we're gonna loop again, and our value,

183
00:10:42.296 --> 00:10:47.610
what loop are we at now, 3 or something?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

184
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:48.244
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: We've looped

185
00:10:48.244 --> 00:10:49.305
three times, I think.

186
00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:53.078
Cool, so our pivot location is still 1.

187
00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:55.040
Is 1 less than 4?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah.

188
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.772
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Absolutely,

189
00:10:55.772 --> 00:10:59.221
so we increment our pivot location.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: My God,

190
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:04.828
I understand that now.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: [LAUGH] Whoo hoo.

191
00:11:04.828 --> 00:11:06.190
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I did it.

192
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.280
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Light bulbs.

193
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:14.370
Okay, so we incremented our pivot
location, and we're going to loop again.

194
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.010
Is our pivot location less than 4?

195
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.700
Yes, so then we increment it again.

196
00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.810
Is 6 less than 4?

197
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:28.394
No, so we're gonna do our swaps.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

198
00:11:28.394 --> 00:11:33.827
then the one thing that we're
not doing is catching when

199
00:11:33.827 --> 00:11:39.040
our pivot location is in its
final place in the world.

200
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.936
So where should we do that?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Could

201
00:11:45.936 --> 00:11:48.240
we wrap the whole loop in a while loop?

202
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.490
Would that be weird?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You probably wouldn't

203
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.290
want to do that.

204
00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.935
I mean, we can just figure out, okay,
we just want to break from this loop.

205
00:11:57.935 --> 00:12:01.590
We don't want to loop more cuz
that would make it some crazy,

206
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:02.651
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

207
00:12:02.651 --> 00:12:05.191
then an else if kind of thing.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm-hm.

208
00:12:08.581 --> 00:12:10.794
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So, we're almost at 4,

209
00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.610
so here's our to do.

210
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:18.670
Add in your break for
when the pivot has landed.

211
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.880
It's almost like a pilot, or a plane.

212
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.330
So when your pivot has landed.

213
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.520
Cool, can you guys do that?

214
00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.300
And that would be your partition.
