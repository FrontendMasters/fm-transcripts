WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.997
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So
we're gonna pseudocode this, and

2
00:00:01.997 --> 00:00:04.730
then we are gonna talk
about breadth-first search.

3
00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.596
And we're gonna pseudocode that, and
then that might be the end of our day,

4
00:00:09.596 --> 00:00:13.870
and you guys can go home, and
code like crazy on your Friday night.

5
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.894
Cuz I think that's what you
were planning to do, right?

6
00:00:15.894 --> 00:00:19.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

7
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.360
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And

8
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.720
then we'll do the solutions
tomorrow morning.

9
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.470
That sound like plan?

10
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.140
Sounds solid?

11
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.730
Okay, here we go.

12
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.800
So we wanna do a depth-first search
on our graph, knowing that our graph

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.730
is an adjacency matrix.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Cool?

14
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.840
So, what order do you think that we might

15
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.067
go?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: If we were to explore

16
00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:55.823
this graph in a depth-first search.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we just go all

17
00:00:55.823 --> 00:00:58.000
the way across the first array?

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.560
Should be down the left column, right?

19
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.930
So we got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So you can only

20
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.718
traverse if there's a connection.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I was just gonna say,

21
00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:08.980
do you have to pay attention to that?

22
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.660
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

23
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.594
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So without looking at

24
00:01:15.594 --> 00:01:19.830
the adjacency list, just give me

25
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.446
an example path.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: 1,

26
00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:28.111
2, 4, 5, 6.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm, yeah, so

27
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:32.700
that would be depth-first,
so we could start at one.

28
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.846
We visit 1, we visit 2,

29
00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:40.570
we visit 4, we visit 5, we visit 6.

30
00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.210
6, we check if there's any adjacents,
and it's explored.

31
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.520
Once there's nothing, it's explored.

32
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.191
We go back.

33
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:53.019
5, we check, it's been explored.

34
00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:57.856
4, explored because these
are direct you can't go backwards.

35
00:01:57.856 --> 00:02:01.843
2, explored.

36
00:02:01.843 --> 00:02:04.870
1?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's not explored.

37
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.060
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Not explored, good.

38
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.910
3?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Not explored.

39
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.620
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Visited.

40
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.790
4?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]

41
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.912
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Is explored, so

42
00:02:13.912 --> 00:02:14.879
we come back.

43
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.680
3 is now?

44
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Explored.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Explored.

45
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.100
And now we're done.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

46
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.610
you can only go back on cycles?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Well this is

47
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.900
just happens to be a directed graph.

48
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.987
So if it was undirected then you could

49
00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:41.821
go either direction.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: But

50
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:45.456
it's been proven that
if it's connected and

51
00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:51.303
you do depth-first search, you will
visit all the nodes at least once.

52
00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:54.450
And probably twice if it's undirected.

53
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.360
Because you'd go both ways.

54
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.016
Or at most, twice.
Make sense?

55
00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:08.230
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: All

56
00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.610
right, so first things first.

57
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.810
We have to start somewhere.

58
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.740
So we'll start with 1.

59
00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.769
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Then what do we do?

60
00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.520
Now we're looking at the adjacency list,
right?

61
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.230
Our implementation is based
on the adjacency list, but

62
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.889
being mindful of how we should be
traversing in the actual graph.

63
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.980
That make sense?

64
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.298
Okay, so we start with 1.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]

65
00:03:46.298 --> 00:03:47.520
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Hm?

66
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Go to left to 2, 2.

67
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.275
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah, so go left.

68
00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:57.291
So we can say, so we'll start with 1,

69
00:03:57.291 --> 00:04:04.293
and when we say start,
we can just say let's visit 1.

70
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:13.563
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: And then we'll visit

71
00:04:13.563 --> 00:04:19.995
2, right?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: visit

72
00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:26.131
4.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: visit 5.

73
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.700
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: visit 6.

74
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.930
Right?

75
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.050
That's what we're doing.

76
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.580
This is gonna be our recursion, right?

77
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.360
Does that make sense?

78
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.780
Okay, so we're visiting down, down, down.

79
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.678
Once we get to the bottom,

80
00:04:55.678 --> 00:05:00.245
so we say like once

81
00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:04.507
there are no more

82
00:05:04.507 --> 00:05:10.129
unexplored.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Nodes?

83
00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.080
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Nodes.

84
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.158
return.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In that tab.

85
00:05:19.158 --> 00:05:20.576
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm,

86
00:05:20.576 --> 00:05:26.930
yep.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

87
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:27.720
we're getting there.

88
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.242
So once we got to the bottom
where we turned up.

89
00:05:32.242 --> 00:05:34.579
Then we're returning up from 5.

90
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.752
Where are we now?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So,

91
00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:41.980
these are recursive calls, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mm-hm.

92
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.577
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Does that make

93
00:05:42.577 --> 00:05:43.174
sense to you?

94
00:05:43.174 --> 00:05:48.900
So, we return up from 6,
we return up from 5.

95
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.682
Every time, we're checking for what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Another connection?

96
00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:55.710
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Mm-hm.

97
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.370
So, we have explored, we have visited,

98
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.480
and we have undiscovered, right?

99
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.540
So, the only one that we have
undiscovered right now is 3.

100
00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:15.050
And we can return once there
are no more unexplored.

101
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.508
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Or is it unvisited?

102
00:06:22.508 --> 00:06:24.720
Now I'm confusing myself.

103
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.990
We'll find out.

104
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.330
Either unexplored or unvisited.

105
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.098
Mm.

106
00:06:28.098 --> 00:06:35.790
Yeah, either way.

107
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:36.720
We haven't been there yet.

108
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.770
So once you've been there, all the places.

109
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.750
So 6, there's no places to go, so return.

110
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.370
5, we check 6.

111
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.120
6 has been explored for sure, right?

112
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.160
Cuz there's nothing left.

113
00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.260
So explored means we visited all
of its adjacent nodes, okay?

114
00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:02.074
And then we're at 4, and we can check 4.

115
00:07:02.074 --> 00:07:05.430
What's adjacent?

116
00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.430
5 has been explored, right?

117
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.730
Because of 6.

118
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.260
And 4 is gonna go back to 2.

119
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.321
2, it's gonna look at four,
but it's been explored, so

120
00:07:20.321 --> 00:07:22.610
it's not really gonna go in there.

121
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.280
It's not gonna recurse in.

122
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.050
And then 1.

123
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.369
Then we see, okay, 2 has been explored.

124
00:07:29.369 --> 00:07:34.710
And then we go, we look at 3, which is
actually undiscovered, we visited it.

125
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.630
And then we go to 3.

126
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:43.070
While we're visiting it, we wanna see
[COUGH] if we can go anywhere from there.

127
00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.880
Then we can go to 4.

128
00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.590
4 is explored so we come back.

129
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:54.976
Now 3 is explored cuz there's
nowhere else for it to go.

130
00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:59.086
And then we go back to 1.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So

131
00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:04.327
you end up going to 4 three times?
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

132
00:08:04.327 --> 00:08:07.680
we're not actually really
inspecting it three times.

133
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.860
You're just popping back into
that layer one of the times.

134
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.310
So you should only explore it,
the number of.

135
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.200
Well, you only explore it once, but

136
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:26.470
you visit it twice.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: That make sense?

137
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:31.398
Cuz exploring is when you actually go
there, and then you keep traversing into

138
00:08:31.398 --> 00:08:33.516
its adjacent, into all of the edges.

139
00:08:33.516 --> 00:08:35.290
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah,

140
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.180
so that's exploring.

141
00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:41.526
So you visit it, and
then once it has been explored,

142
00:08:41.526 --> 00:08:45.302
then that means you've seen it all.

143
00:08:45.302 --> 00:08:50.000
You've seen all of its-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So,

144
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.501
in order to explore 3,
you have to see that it's connected to 4?

145
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.550
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: For 3 to be explored,

146
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:04.494
that means you already visited 4 and left.

147
00:09:04.494 --> 00:09:06.370
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So

148
00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:08.660
there's nowhere else for it to go,
and so now it's explored and

149
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.356
you just mark it black.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Right,

150
00:09:09.356 --> 00:09:09.856
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: Yeah.

151
00:09:09.856 --> 00:09:10.441
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, yep.

152
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:12.220
&gt;&gt; Bianca Gandolfo: So you're done with

153
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.250
it.
There's nothing else for you to do.

154
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.844
You already did your business,
whatever it is that you're doing.
