1
00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.560
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: We're going to
go through a style of learning

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.370
that is going to be very
demanding of all of you.

3
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.080
I'm going to be calling on each person
in the room on a fairly regular basis

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.290
in order for us to talk through our code
as precisely and clearly as possible but

5
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.682
first briefly, that's my background,
there's Codesmith,

6
00:00:24.682 --> 00:00:30.320
Codesmith LA, we just left this office for
a beautiful new office in Venice Beach,

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.230
in the heart of Venice Beach,
underneath the Venice sign.

8
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.160
I don't know if anybody knows that place,
but it is nice.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.530
There's me with my
Newberry Talented Sisters.

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.250
All of whom, actually,

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.370
Ersey, on the far right there,
has just started her finals at Oxford.

12
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.030
Often they won't do a model where you

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.460
do intermediate exams that
form your final grade.

14
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.489
Your final grade is, instead,

15
00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.482
produced by two weeks of exams at
the end of the entire program.

16
00:01:00.482 --> 00:01:04.250
Meaning you can do what you want
until those final two weeks.

17
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.580
And in those final two weeks,
my goodness, it is the worst two weeks.

18
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.747
I remember three nights in a row,
getting two hours sleep before my papers.

19
00:01:14.747 --> 00:01:15.750
My goodness.

20
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.938
Anyway, there you go one of my sisters.

21
00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:22.352
I use to work at Icecom,
it was a popular WebRTC library and

22
00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:26.404
then Gem,
which is a block chain company that's done

23
00:01:26.404 --> 00:01:30.570
every possible thing in
the block chain crypto space.

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.190
Very, very cool company
with excellent leadership.

25
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.130
Very nice company.

26
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.230
All right, I run Codesmith.

27
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.030
Very briefly, what is Codesmith?

28
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.190
First and foremost, by the way, a center
of software engineering excellence.

29
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.070
I can't stress enough.

30
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.580
Yes, Codesmith, in the end, produces
people with the skills to go and build

31
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.900
the things they dream up, to go and work
in the companies they dream to work at.

32
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.620
But that is not the purpose and
that speaks for

33
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.320
everything we're going to do today.

34
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.130
The goal of becoming a great engineer,
is to have the ability to build.

35
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.097
As a side effect of that,
we get this unique opportunity to work

36
00:02:08.097 --> 00:02:11.848
in roles that
are intellectually satisfying,

37
00:02:11.848 --> 00:02:16.368
creative and I guess stable,
financially fulfilling.

38
00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:17.640
I don't know if this ever existed before.

39
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.750
That was a great great
privilege to have that so

40
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.670
that is what Codesmith produces,
grads work at Google,

41
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.280
Amazon, PayPal, Microsoft, Oscar,
okay all these other companies.

42
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.430
Only a quarter get senior positions,
most get mid-level engineering positions.

43
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.320
By the way, the kind of material we're
seeing today is the kind of material

44
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:44.330
that grads get asked interview
questions on the entire time.

45
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.360
We surveyed grads a few weeks ago,
what's the thing you get asked about most?

46
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.310
Number one, event loop, how is it working?

47
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.570
For mid senior jobs, number one question.

48
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.180
Number two, closure.

49
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.220
How is it working under the hood?

50
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.610
Now hard part's part one has
a detailed breakout of closure.

51
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.930
We're not going to go through it in
the same level of detail, but by the way,

52
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.010
is a preview for
us to understand iterators.

53
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.420
We're gonna need to deeply
understand closure, all right.

54
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.620
What is there to say?

55
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.540
I will say it's been in the middle.

56
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.800
It is special for
me that every person in this room,

57
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.660
we are independent agnostic
to your background.

58
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.320
And the same thing goes at Goldsmith.

59
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.880
You have the Princeton CS grad

60
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.920
learning alongside the person
who didn't go to college.

61
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.110
And that again, the beautiful
thing about software engineering.

62
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.440
We always focus on the program.

63
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.860
The only feedback you get in
interviews is not enough experience.

64
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.980
Everyone's favorite, but that's
the most empowering feedback on earth.

65
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.310
This is the only industry where
not enough experience is really

66
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.230
we asked you ten questions and
you go and answer four of them.

67
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.630
Well go fill in the six over the next
few days, and that's why in the end

68
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.170
being an engineer is the ability to break
through blocks in your understanding.

69
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.020
And what an incredibly
empowering industry that is.

70
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.810
Where you can go from not having enough
experience, to just three days later

71
00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.860
having enough experience because
you've broken through those blocks.

72
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.680
And that is the ess of the Codesmith.

73
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.270
Alright, good.

74
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.920
The team that makes Codesmith possible,
these very very very nice people.

75
00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.180
Ugh.

76
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.570
Shoutout to Eric.

77
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.379
Whose movie, he has a side project,

78
00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.182
a movie called Midnight Sun,
aimed at a young adult audience,

79
00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:40.006
had a $10 million budget,
broke $25 million globally.

80
00:04:40.006 --> 00:04:41.380
Isn't that incredible?

81
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.281
He's now close friends with Justine Bieber
who is at the premier conference.

82
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:52.110
But nevertheless, I think he does,
he may have the Bieb's number.

83
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.010
I'm not sure.

84
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.510
But this is a wonderful collection
of people he makes Codesmith.

85
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.540
LA, and New York.

86
00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.330
Two locations happen.

87
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.200
Wonderful people.

88
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.260
Snow there, who runs technical in LA,
20 years experience.

89
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.360
Anyway wonderful people.

90
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.860
Good.

91
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.020
By the way, the things we look for
in Codesmith candidates,

92
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.140
just if you're interested, but I will say
more significantly to everybody else.

93
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.850
The things that companies look for
in their own engineering candidates.

94
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.880
Not junior dev, not entry-level,
but mid or senior.

95
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.420
That is the ability to
take any new feature.

96
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.199
And implement it.

97
00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.480
Well what does that require?

98
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.680
Problem solving,
that is the fundamental thing.

99
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.280
Can I break through a block?

100
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.340
Notice fifth most important is your
knowledge of the language or framework.

101
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.650
Those things, they evolve.

102
00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.640
Our friend James here already commented.

103
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.120
The front-end frameworks,
they evolve as a new Reshe?

104
00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.690
Is that a word?

105
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.709
I made a word up.

106
00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:51.253
Is that a word?

107
00:05:51.253 --> 00:05:52.384
Is that a word?

108
00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:53.196
Sure.

109
00:05:53.196 --> 00:05:55.761
As the new boojey framework, and that's
not the word either, that I'm looking for.

110
00:05:55.761 --> 00:05:58.318
Reshe, Rishie, I'm sure it's a word.

111
00:05:58.318 --> 00:06:01.264
There's a new,
someone in line is going yes.

112
00:06:01.264 --> 00:06:02.238
That's a word.

113
00:06:02.238 --> 00:06:05.330
I haven't heard that word for
seven teen years.

114
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.072
70 years.

115
00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:12.189
New on trend framework every year,
that's not what makes a great engineer,

116
00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:14.720
you're a technician, in that case.

117
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.160
You're an angular technician,
you're inflexible.

118
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.420
What makes a great engineer,
by the way, what we look for

119
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.110
in Code Smith candidates is your
ability to break through your blocks.

120
00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.630
We're gonna do that today, and
you're technical communication.

121
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.990
When I call on every single person in this
room today to talk through your code,

122
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.280
what we're doing is refining
our technical communication.

123
00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.570
Okay, that's what we're doing.

124
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.600
And then best practice in approach and
your nontechnical communication.

125
00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.350
And even here,
expectation is supporting each other.

126
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.160
This is not an environment to show off.

127
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.090
But rather an environment to embrace
the growth of those around you

128
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.470
which is a wonderful context in
which to grow your own self.
