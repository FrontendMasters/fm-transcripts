00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.700
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay people.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:05.300
These are gonna get so
much more powerful in a moment but

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.340
first, we're going to go
back to our pairing, and

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.270
you're gonna start pairing through
some challenges on iterators.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.210
Get to your pairs.

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.536
You're gonna go to CS bin.

7
00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:24.526
This time, csbin.IO/, csbin.io/Iterators,

8
00:00:24.526 --> 00:00:27.720
and start working through,

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.186
building your very own
iterators from scratch.

10
00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:37.684
And then using some of
JavaScript's built in iterators,

11
00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:42.088
hint, you find the function
that creates them under a wee

12
00:00:42.088 --> 00:00:46.865
property called symbol.iterator
on every array.

13
00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:48.015
When you call that function,

14
00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.805
it's gonna give you out an equivalent
of the returnNext element.

15
00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:57.670
That is our built-in iterator functions
that are available for individual arrays.

16
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.270
But your challenge is gonna start off
with you building your own from scratch.

17
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.510
All right, folks,
here's csbin.io/iterators for

18
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.245
our online audience.

19
00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:05.120
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: The same,

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.265
get back to your pairing, people, and.

21
00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:09.920
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Let's just make sure

22
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.393
the link, I'll just put the link up.

23
00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:13.777
Actually no, I think everyone got that.

24
00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:17.655
csbin.io/iterators, csbin.io/iterators.

25
00:01:17.655 --> 00:01:19.152
And we'll leave this code up.
