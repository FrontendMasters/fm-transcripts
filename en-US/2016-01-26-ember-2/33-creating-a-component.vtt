[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.982
&gt;&gt; Michael North: I think the best way to
illustrate how this works is to jump in

3
00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:10.710
and code one of these things up.

4
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.250
So that you guys can see how it all
fits together and how it works.

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.370
And then we're gonna extend our example,
our project,

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.192
by componentizing a few things.

7
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:37.060
&gt;&gt; Michael North: So I'm just going
to create a component with Ember CLI.

8
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.070
&gt;&gt; Michael North: Called social-info.

9
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.450
Remember we need the dash in the name.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.910
And we can see that
a JavaScript file was created,

11
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.745
a template was created in this component
sub folder of the templates directory and

12
00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:55.089
an integration test was created for us.

13
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.566
So if we go back to our code,
I'm gonna close a bunch of this stuff out.

14
00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:08.471
&gt;&gt; Michael North: I'm going to just
start consuming it cuz right now it's

15
00:01:08.471 --> 00:01:11.444
a component that is blank,
it does nothing.

16
00:01:14.008 --> 00:01:18.120
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And what I want
us to do is display my name and

17
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.334
then some social network links.

18
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.509
&gt;&gt; Michael North: So
we'll just start there.

19
00:01:32.597 --> 00:01:35.846
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And right now we
are passing data into the component but,

20
00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:39.298
we haven't specified how things
should be rendered, and so

21
00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.343
it's not really interesting yet.

22
00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:50.480
&gt;&gt; Michael North: So,
I'm gonna open these up side by side,

23
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.449
so we can see the JavaScript on
the left and the template on the right,

24
00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:57.200
both corresponding to this component.

25
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.296
So, we'll start by consuming this name.

26
00:02:05.347 --> 00:02:06.640
&gt;&gt; Michael North: Fantastic.

27
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.098
And then, I'm gonna create a list.

28
00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.340
&gt;&gt; Michael North: So there we go.

29
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.740
And I'll just add this.

30
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.630
Right, so effectively we're already
seeing a little bit of a benefit here.

31
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.090
Because this is more expressive
than this over here on the right.

32
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.817
If you imagine that you're reviewing
your peer's code, I would much rather

33
00:02:56.817 --> 00:03:01.705
review what's on the right once and then
see this popping up all over the place.

34
00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:06.355
Cuz this is telling me what it is, and
it has a contract that makes sense for

35
00:03:06.355 --> 00:03:08.013
what we're trying to do.

36
00:03:08.013 --> 00:03:11.026
So we're already seeing a little
bit of a benefit here so

37
00:03:11.026 --> 00:03:13.533
I'm gonna add a second
social network thing.

38
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.827
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And
we'll add the equivalent.

39
00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:35.010
&gt;&gt; Michael North: Do not save.

40
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.310
All right.

41
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.150
So now we've got Twitter and GitHub.

42
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:45.570
So if we wanted to extend a little
bit further we can allow it to handle

43
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.740
the case where we don't have a Twitter
account a little bit more gracefully,

44
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.448
this looks silly.

45
00:03:49.448 --> 00:03:52.898
So, if twitter, and

46
00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:59.330
we can do the same thing for GitHub.

47
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.344
But now we're starting to see
that this logic even one to

48
00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:10.863
bread into the header bar file folder
of the screens that I'm building.

49
00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:15.540
This is really a lower level concern
that I wanna be working with.

50
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.920
So great, and let's say that I
want to be able to expand and

51
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.290
collapse the social network links.

52
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.950
So we'll have to deal with an action here.

53
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:33.197
So I'm gonna give my component
a property here called, is.

54
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:38.700
&gt;&gt; Michael North: So we have isExpanded,
which is true by default.

55
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.356
So it will start expanded.

56
00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:46.105
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And
I want to say if it is collapsed,

57
00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:49.270
I wanna see the expand link up here.

58
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.106
So.

59
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.255
&gt;&gt; Michael North: All right, so
it looks like my inequality maybe flipped,

60
00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.211
or my conditional.

61
00:05:28.922 --> 00:05:30.555
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you say it was standard?

62
00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:31.055
&gt;&gt; Michael North: You're right.

63
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.380
Thank you.
And

64
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.350
then down here I'm gonna
just wrap this whole thing.

65
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.446
And down here finally.

66
00:06:01.424 --> 00:06:02.418
&gt;&gt; Michael North: Great.

67
00:06:02.418 --> 00:06:04.110
So I've got collapse here.

68
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.627
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And
if I give myself a little more room.

69
00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:24.010
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And I click Collapse.

70
00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.100
All right, so we're getting a similar
error to what we were seeing yesterday

71
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.200
when we didn't have an action handler.

72
00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:31.210
And the reason is,

73
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:36.160
this is an action internal to
this component that is unhandled.

74
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:42.010
So the same rules apply for
unhandled actions in the outside world.

75
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.940
The only place where you get
the freedom to fire stuff and

76
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.720
not care whether someone
is listening is firing

77
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.350
through the contract between the component
and staff outside the component.

78
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.361
So here we're gonna add our action.

79
00:07:04.855 --> 00:07:10.520
&gt;&gt; Michael North: A shortcut for
flipping the boolean and toggle property.

80
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:16.120
And now we can see we have expendable,
collapsible component here.

81
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.940
And let's say that we wanted
to also make the outside world

82
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.290
aware of what's going on here.

83
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:27.520
So maybe, maybe the route needs to be able
to listen to what this component is doing.

84
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.275
We would simply do this.

85
00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:37.673
&gt;&gt; Michael North: On-links-toggle.

86
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:42.690
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And that's it.

87
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:50.200
So now we're sending an action out,
we can listen to it through the contract.

88
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.250
And now when we click we're
gonna get a new error message

89
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.960
saying nothing is handling links toggled.

90
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.220
So now what we've done is
we've created the binding.

91
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.880
We've gone through the contract.

92
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.510
But now we've opted into listening to it,

93
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:13.220
we have nothing listening, nothing
handling this action on the other end.

94
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:20.109
So we would simply go to the route and
add an action here.

95
00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:30.170
&gt;&gt; Michael North: And clear this out.

96
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:34.270
And now you can see, our route is aware

97
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.680
of what's going on inside this
component through an action binding.

98
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.040
Does this make sense to everyone?

99
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.105
Any question so far?
