&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm gonna go over the next
step to our wonderful little GitHub app.

3
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.210
So we're gonna have this
concept of favoriting orgs.

4
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.770
Favoriting orgs, and I want the service
to hold the source of truth for

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.420
the set of favorite orgs.

6
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.880
So, a couple steps here.

7
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.880
I think this time I'm on one page, but
yes, and just a screenshot of the result.

8
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.686
So we wanna create
a service called Favorites,

9
00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:41.635
with an array on it called Items, and

10
00:00:41.635 --> 00:00:47.240
I already did something that is just
a change of names away from that.

11
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.160
We want that service to be
available on the route for

12
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.740
the orgs list, and then, next to each org,

13
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:04.120
inside the each helper, I want
a span with an action binding on it.

14
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.000
And then an action on
the route that will add

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.520
that appropriate org to
the list of favorites.

16
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.519
And at the bottom here, and just so
we have some feedback, because

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.194
the visual state will not
actually update as you favorite.

18
00:01:26.194 --> 00:01:28.410
We're gonna take care of
that in the next step.

19
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.220
But you should console.log every
time that you add something,

20
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.960
just so you can see feedback that
you've actually favorited something.

21
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.250
And what I'm suggesting is just log
the whole array, dot join comma,

22
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.910
so that you can kind of
see what's going on.

23
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.690
And the last thing is,
addObject will check for

24
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.068
presence as long as you're
using primitive values.

25
00:01:55.068 --> 00:01:59.756
If you're using objects, as we just saw,

26
00:01:59.756 --> 00:02:04.340
each one is a unique instance, you know.

27
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.770
So this is what you're aiming for,
something that looks like this.

28
00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.330
Where if I click, you get something
like this logged to the console.
