[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:06.760
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The next thing
I wanna do is fire an action.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:13.236
The way we're gonna do that is by
clicking on the favorite span and

4
00:00:13.236 --> 00:00:20.801
I'm guessing the selector will be
something like this with a span after it.

5
00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.541
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So we've got our
debugger fired and let me just make

6
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:50.760
sure that this is doing
what I think it's doing.

7
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.010
Perfect, and so
actually before this, I'm gonna

8
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.400
set up the sort of listener, the handler
for the action in advance of the click.

9
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.023
And the action that we
fire is on-fav-clicked.

10
00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.045
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Make sure it's fired.

11
00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:27.245
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And we need to do
one extra thing here actually.

12
00:01:32.303 --> 00:01:33.628
&gt;&gt; Mike North: One.

13
00:01:35.397 --> 00:01:40.330
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So the test is finishing
before we actually get to what we need

14
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.210
to get to.

15
00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:45.613
This-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You need to pass that

16
00:01:45.613 --> 00:01:49.993
definition of we're actually retriggering,
when you instantiate,

17
00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:52.620
when you render the object into the.

18
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.046
Did you render the component?

19
00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.407
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Good point, good point.

20
00:02:03.517 --> 00:02:04.950
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I didn't have
my action binding there.

21
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410
Did not exist on object.

22
00:02:18.606 --> 00:02:20.764
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You know
what I think I can do here,

23
00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:23.749
pardon me stumbling
through this a little bit.

24
00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:40.145
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Shouldn't you mean this.set
favoriteWasClicked as a function-

25
00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:41.984
&gt;&gt; Mike North: No, this.set, so

26
00:02:41.984 --> 00:02:47.949
I'm doing this here, set my action and
then the action handler.

27
00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:57.031
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't think
that's the name of the function,

28
00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:59.910
I think you named in something different.

29
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.681
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It's the external
name of the action and

30
00:03:04.681 --> 00:03:08.056
we don't have a run loop on.

31
00:03:12.353 --> 00:03:15.113
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So let me write
another piece of the test first.

32
00:03:40.857 --> 00:03:41.847
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so,

33
00:03:41.847 --> 00:03:47.800
looks like the act of clicking on that
is not doing what I expect it to do.

34
00:04:01.253 --> 00:04:03.113
&gt;&gt; Mike North: favoriteWasClicked.

35
00:04:34.828 --> 00:04:35.328
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It's very odd.

36
00:04:44.295 --> 00:04:49.443
Yes, so beyond even the idea
of attaching to the action,

37
00:04:49.443 --> 00:04:54.701
I would expect it to fire
the internal component action and

38
00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:58.155
change from favorite to unfavorite.

39
00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:03.403
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE]
this.set [INAUDIBLE] this.set

40
00:05:03.403 --> 00:05:08.071
action test [INAUDIBLE] to a function.

41
00:05:08.071 --> 00:05:09.919
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay.

42
00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And it works.

43
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.890
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
let's give that a shot then.

44
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:22.598
So this.set on-fav-clicked,
and then I used the binding.

45
00:05:22.598 --> 00:05:28.094
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: And I passed in favorite
clicked equals on-fav-clicked,

46
00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.286
as a remote.

47
00:05:33.763 --> 00:05:35.260
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So that happened to do it.

48
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.450
Interesting, okay, whew.

49
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.067
So what I would do here,
is just have something like this.

50
00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:08.348
&gt;&gt; Mike North: This will help you catch,
two or three times,

51
00:06:08.348 --> 00:06:10.016
the action being fired.

52
00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:14.925
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Except
actually how easy it is-

53
00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:16.010
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah, you're right, sorry.

54
00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.513
And this is still not working
as I'd expect, interesting.

55
00:06:25.513 --> 00:06:29.529
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: So are we just
testing if that function fires?

56
00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:31.099
Is that what we've got right here?

57
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.350
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
that 'll test that the action is fired.

58
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.720
What it does not do and
I believe it's because,

59
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.130
what it doesn't do is validate that
favorite actually changes to unfavorite.

60
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.695
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: In chat they're saying
shouldn't you be listening to favorite

61
00:06:46.695 --> 00:06:47.530
clicked?

62
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.600
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So I actually think
I know what's going on here.

63
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.760
We haven't injected
the service onto gitHub-org.

64
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.240
That is the source of truth for
this array.

65
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.020
So there is really no way to know whether
something's been favorited or not.

66
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:06.187
So I'm going to create this here,

67
00:07:06.187 --> 00:07:12.497
let's see if that will
give us some better luck.

68
00:07:12.497 --> 00:07:16.738
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: All favorite clicked
does is pass through the action,

69
00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:20.251
it doesn't test anything with the service.

70
00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:22.112
Internal analytic component.

71
00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:24.962
When you trigger favorite clicked,
it just passes.

72
00:07:24.962 --> 00:07:26.333
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Action setting.

73
00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:28.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 7: It doesn't do
anything with the service at all.

74
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.390
The service is the least
favorite property.

75
00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.282
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I got you, okay.

76
00:07:34.282 --> 00:07:36.841
Sorry, we're getting in
the weeds here guys.

77
00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:41.653
So I'm gonna just blow this away here and

78
00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:46.619
leave this as the test for the component.

79
00:07:46.619 --> 00:07:49.693
And move on to the acceptance test in
the interest of making sure we get to

80
00:07:49.693 --> 00:07:50.880
keep covering stuff here.
