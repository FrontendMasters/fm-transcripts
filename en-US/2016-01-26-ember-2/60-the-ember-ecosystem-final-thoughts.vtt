[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:10.234
&gt;&gt; Mike North: In terms of how I feel
about Ember's big shining strength.

3
00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:14.656
It's that the decisions
they've made in terms of.

4
00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:17.960
The decisions that have been made by the
community in terms of bringing it to where

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.850
it is really are in line with the idea
that developers are expensive,

6
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.540
servers are cheap.

7
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.390
And improving productivity,

8
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.210
improving your ergonomics,
helping people get up and running.

9
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.780
Helping people get an app out there and
get feedback on it.

10
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.760
Facilitating the sharing of code.

11
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.610
Those are all first class concerns to,

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.009
particularly to businesses that
are building you know, products,

13
00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:52.040
and it has proven to be a good
pattern that has grown, you know,

14
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.710
a robust ecosystem at this point.

15
00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.410
It's also great to see how consistency
facilitates this interoperability.

16
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.310
It allows you, you know,
as someone who knows Ember to go and

17
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.310
look at someone elseâ€™s app, and
you know what you're dealing with.

18
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.220
You can help troubleshoot it,
you can give feedback on it.

19
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.130
There are well understood idioms that
we're all trying to align with, and

20
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.430
as a result, your skill set is
very portable in completeness.

21
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.870
It's not that you know how
to use jQuery widgets and so

22
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.330
you can go and immediately be productive.

23
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.240
And any app that has jQuery widgets,

24
00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.060
the tool chain is the same, the templating
language is likely to be the same,

25
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.370
the organisation of the product
is probably the same.

26
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.984
It's starting to go so far as to even
have very similar deployment processes,

27
00:01:48.984 --> 00:01:55.108
standardized across Ember apps because,
you know, there's a happy path that's so

28
00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:59.548
easy that people can't help but
adopt it and build around it.

29
00:01:59.548 --> 00:02:04.384
I love to see how great
attention has been paid

30
00:02:04.384 --> 00:02:08.591
to Apps with significant complexity.

31
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:12.500
You know, speaking as a developer
of complex apps, I don't fear

32
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.990
that I'm going to outgrow the idioms or
the patterns or the abstractions.

33
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.490
Because I've been to that

34
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.171
down that road of the 70 or
80,000 line UI,

35
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:32.550
80,000 lines of JavaScript and
the patterns hold up.

36
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.695
And so I know whatever I end up setting
out to build next, you can get massive and

37
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:44.165
things still operate in the same way
things the organizational structure still

38
00:02:44.165 --> 00:02:49.515
ends up being manageable all the way up.

39
00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:57.180
And lastly I just wanna kind of try shine
a light on some recent adoption of ember.

40
00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.340
A lot of companies use this for
internal and external apps.

41
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.100
You've definitely used
a lot of ember apps.

42
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.320
Like Heroku, dashboard is pretty famous.

43
00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.990
Vine is written in ember.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You forgot

44
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.020
Apple.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What's that?

45
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.275
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You forgot Apple.

46
00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:18.070
[INAUDIBLE] so Apple Music, you're saying?

47
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.790
Music's another app.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting.

48
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.708
And iCloud was written in Sprout Core,
which is in Ember's pedigree.

49
00:03:25.708 --> 00:03:32.350
So when considering like is this tried and
tested, absolutely it is.

50
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.200
Absolutely.

51
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.140
And there's more and
more adoption you know every month.

52
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.240
And I promised one of the goals
here was to leave you guys with

53
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.050
a set of places to go if you
have questions and need help.

54
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.010
And first, definitely tweet me,
reach out to me.

55
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.310
I'm happy to try to straighten people out.

56
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.007
I like unsticking people and
it gives me a lot of good fuzzy feelings

57
00:04:03.007 --> 00:04:09.000
to help people kind of keep
charging along and productive.

58
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.125
So definitely reach out to me and
look at the docs and

59
00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:18.620
the guides, a lot of time has been spent
on those they are better than most.

60
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.760
Definitely worth the read.

61
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.450
Ember-twiddle is a very
interesting online coding

62
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.960
app where instead of using
something like JSFiddle or

63
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.965
CodePen where you sort of have one big
HTML thing and a Javascript thing.

64
00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:37.127
Ember-twiddle will fill like yes,

65
00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:41.210
six modules in alignment with
the Ember-CLI project structures.

66
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.776
So you can actually create you
know your router.js file and

67
00:04:44.776 --> 00:04:46.780
share that as a link with people.

68
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.150
And one of the coolest things about it is
that gists are its persistence mechanism.

69
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:59.230
So you end up creating a gist for
this thing, which is great to have.

70
00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.426
That in itself is very useful.

71
00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:06.460
So recently it was brought into
the Ember CLI GitHub org and

72
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.050
the indication there is we're
making sure this works,

73
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.540
we're trying to adopt this is the tool of
choice, not to say other tools are worse,

74
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.330
but we're making sure that it is
it turns out very turns out great.

75
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.440
There's a website called emberaddons.com.

76
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.517
It's a searchable index of ready-to-go

77
00:05:32.517 --> 00:05:36.620
you know turnkey functionality.

78
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.557
And again, the ranking structure or

79
00:05:40.557 --> 00:05:44.749
the ranking rubric is very objective.

80
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:49.633
So generally, if you are looking at
something that's a nine out of ten,

81
00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:53.096
it's a good chance that
that works as advertised.

82
00:05:53.096 --> 00:05:58.650
Discussed at emberjs.com
is the official forum.

83
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.680
And it's particularly interesting
because discuss the form software itself

84
00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.270
is an Ember app.

85
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.290
So it's a good place to look.

86
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.300
I should say it's an open
source piece of form software.

87
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.920
So you can actually poke
around in the code.

88
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.974
But it's a good place to post longer
questions where you have an example and

89
00:06:19.974 --> 00:06:22.078
you're asking about a particular scenario.

90
00:06:22.078 --> 00:06:27.178
And definitely sign-up for the Slack
Channel, look at the Ember-CLI Docs in

91
00:06:27.178 --> 00:06:32.680
particular, if you're interested in Add
on development and extending Ember CLI.

92
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.230
So I hope that you guys have
gotten a lot out of this,

93
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.690
and just keep up to date
with the latest news.

94
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.940
It's a moving target and
we're very excited about what's

95
00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:45.500
coming forward.

96
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Question.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yes.

97
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Anyone using it for

98
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.540
mobile like.

99
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.820
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

100
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.920
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So a great example of Ember

101
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.964
in mobile is look at the company YAPP,
Y-A-P-P.

102
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.010
They've done some serious ember
mobile development stuff.

103
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.499
And I'm actually using it for

104
00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.987
mobile at Levanto as well.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: With Cordova

105
00:07:11.987 --> 00:07:12.952
or?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yep,

106
00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:15.480
Cordova it works well with Cordova.

107
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.650
And on desktop it works with electron and
with NWJS.

108
00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.770
And again if you think about the other
options you have when building mobile apps

109
00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.670
or desktop apps, you want a rich
application framework there.

110
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:36.990
And this is much closer to what
it would feel like to build

111
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:41.850
a native desktop app, an objective C or
a mobile app in Swift.

112
00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:46.040
You know, it's a great foundation
to build on for anything.

113
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.950
Alright, are there any questions?

114
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:53.410
We're here at the end of the workshop.

115
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.370
Last chance.

116
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.810
Except that I'm available to
answer questions all the time.

117
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.819
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: You showed [INAUDIBLE] is

118
00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:06.200
there a release cycle?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yes.

119
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Once a month,

120
00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.260
once a quarter?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It's once every six weeks.

121
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.120
And what that means is every
six weeks a new release is cut,

122
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.640
a new beta is sort of open.

123
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.707
Like in this case,

124
00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:20.920
we're on 2.2 beta because 2.1 was
just released earlier this week.

125
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:26.480
And typically there will
be very clear focus

126
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.130
as to what's happening in
the current release cycle and

127
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.250
the next release cycle there will
be some sort of high level goals.

128
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:38.117
And then beyond that there's really
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There's little point in

129
00:08:38.117 --> 00:08:42.316
planning that far ahead because,
as an open source project,

130
00:08:42.316 --> 00:08:45.545
you know it's velocity
is a little difficult to

131
00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:52.174
predict.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All

132
00:08:52.174 --> 00:08:53.490
right any questions online?

133
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.270
I see a question of IRC channel.

134
00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:05.750
So the ember IRC channel has sort of
become way less popular due to slack

135
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:11.690
being a better sort of conversational
medium for those kinds of discussions.

136
00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.690
And the slack channel right now has
somewhere between two and three thousand

137
00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.799
developers on it, and you know hundreds
are on it at any given point of time.

138
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.620
So it's a great place to ask questions,
core team members are on it very, very,

139
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.760
very often.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: And

140
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.910
very, very, very helpful.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

141
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:35.280
they're super helpful and accessible and
they will help you sort your problems out.

142
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.351
So definitely don't cheat
yourself of that important

143
00:09:39.351 --> 00:09:44.289
resource.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

144
00:09:44.289 --> 00:09:47.710
well thank you guys very much for
your attention and I hope you enjoyed it.
