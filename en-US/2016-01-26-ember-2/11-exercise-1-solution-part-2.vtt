00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:05.217
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I wanna
just go back to orgs.

3
00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:15.692
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We've got Welcome to
Ember there and that's kind of silly, so

4
00:00:15.692 --> 00:00:17.120
I'm gonna get rid of that.

5
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.780
I'm gonna go to application.hbs,
which is the place you put

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.220
things that are showing up no matter what,
it wraps everything.

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.190
I'm gonna delete that default stuff.

8
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.380
And then we have an outlet there.

9
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.340
So really, when we have
a template that looks like this,

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.660
it's really a pass through.

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.730
And in fact,
when Ember CLI generates a template for

12
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.458
you as part of building a new route,
this is what it's going to create.

13
00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:43.040
The reason is,

14
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.860
even if you don't touch this, everything
will continue to work as you expect.

15
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.750
If, for example, some parent route

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.720
doesn't add anything visual to the screen,
but child routes are important.

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.960
This will allow everything to pass
through and work as you would expect.

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.230
And in fact, if I were to delete this
file, Ember will fall back to a default

19
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.480
template and continue to function, and
this would be the default template.

20
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.776
So next I want to go to the orgs.

21
00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:22.436
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Template and
I'm just gonna say.

22
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.850
&gt;&gt; Mike North: My favorite orgs.

23
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.970
And I'm gonna create.

24
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.410
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Some lis and
I'm gonna link to.

25
00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.445
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Org.repos,
and I just wanna make

26
00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:55.160
sure that works, so I'll save it.

27
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.680
All right, so
if I hover over this I can see, and

28
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.530
it's very difficult to see, unfortunately
Chrome doesn't scale this up.

29
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.396
But my URL hovering over this
I can see is Org/jQuery/Repos.

30
00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.480
This would be the list of repos for
jQuery.

31
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.772
So this is in fact what I want.

32
00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:22.566
I'm gonna shrink this down a little so
we can make it look nice and copy it.

33
00:02:33.366 --> 00:02:34.706
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
we'll just change this to.

34
00:02:48.986 --> 00:02:54.627
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So now we've our list of
Orgs, and the URL changes as I go through

35
00:02:54.627 --> 00:03:00.050
and I can see that my dynamic
segment works as expected.

36
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.996
So we've got this part done.

37
00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:06.160
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, so
now I'm gonna go to an individual org.

38
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.300
So I'm on the,
I actually have two routes active,

39
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.260
that I haven't touched the template for.

40
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.704
I've got org.hbs, and org/repos.hbs, and

41
00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:21.080
I can find out that these templates
are active through the Ember inspector.

42
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.690
If I look at the Active Routes tab, it
will actually show you and the view tree

43
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.990
will let you hover over and see that these
are what are showing up on the screen.

44
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.812
So, if I go that org.hbs, and

45
00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:37.516
I'm just going to put Facebook here or

46
00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:43.400
something, and I'm gonna to orgrepos.hbs.

47
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.936
Orgrepos.hps, and here another list.

48
00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:58.156
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm gonna do link, so

49
00:03:58.156 --> 00:04:05.729
link-to react org.repo.issues and

50
00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:08.259
then react.

51
00:04:11.956 --> 00:04:16.809
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, so you guys may
have structured your routes differently,

52
00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:18.617
and I just wanna paint it,

53
00:04:18.617 --> 00:04:24.880
I wanna illustrate the difference between
what you're seeing on the screen here.

54
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.220
So here the list of orgs and
an individual org,

55
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.290
they don't really share anything in
common in terms of the template.

56
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.890
If I had just, had like orgs index for

57
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:44.410
the list and then orgs something else.

58
00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.920
They would share this
common orgs.hbs template.

59
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.980
You'd actually be pivoting at
a lower node in the route hierarchy.

60
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.500
And when you're pivoting on a lower node,

61
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.439
that will typically correspond to common
elements being shown on the screen.

62
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.036
Right, so I'll just hover over the view
tree here, so we can see what that means.

63
00:05:16.486 --> 00:05:21.246
&gt;&gt; Mike North: If you don't mind
I'm just gonna hopefully, oops.

64
00:05:21.246 --> 00:05:26.862
We're hopefully gonna speed things
up by not mirroring anymore.

65
00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:31.582
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,
that's much better.

66
00:05:31.582 --> 00:05:36.603
[LAUGH] So if we look at routes here,
and I make this wider, and you look at

67
00:05:36.603 --> 00:05:42.600
the current route only, we can see that
we've got application and we've got orgs.

68
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.790
And if you look at the views,
that is exactly what you'd expect.

69
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.890
Remember we cleared everything
out of application,

70
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.580
and so you're seeing that basically
orgs is the entirely of application.

71
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.816
It's filling that outlet, and
there's nothing else to application.hps.

72
00:05:57.816 --> 00:06:03.266
If we go into an individual repo here,
we've got org,

73
00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:08.963
right, instead of orgs and
that's the templates here.

74
00:06:08.963 --> 00:06:13.581
And then, within that,
we've got org.repos, and

75
00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:17.900
that's going to be basically
this section here.

76
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.170
So, one of the requirements on
the screen was that any time you're,

77
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:30.135
one of the requirements listed for
this exercise was, any time you're viewing

78
00:06:30.135 --> 00:06:33.536
a particular org, I want a link that says,
back to the list of orgs.

79
00:06:33.536 --> 00:06:34.946
And so I'm just gonna add that here.

80
00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:47.402
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And it will pop-up here and
so we can go back and forth and back and

81
00:06:47.402 --> 00:06:48.120
forth.

82
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.250
And of course we've hard coded everything,
and so you don't really see things

83
00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.400
changing in terms of what's rendered but
the URL is accurate, right?

84
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.900
And that's the point of this exercise.

85
00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.890
So, let's continue our work here.

86
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.230
Just copy this into the li and

87
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:13.330
we'll do react-native,

88
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:19.070
and we'll do watchman.

89
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.940
And now we've got a list of repositories.

90
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.000
And when we drill into one of these,

91
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.216
you'll see that because we're
still in the context of org.

92
00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:39.653
This part of the template
remains on the screen,

93
00:07:39.653 --> 00:07:46.875
and so if I go to repo.hbs and
I do something like this,

94
00:07:46.875 --> 00:07:52.535
let's take it down one layer, one point.

95
00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:57.857
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So that's the repo, and

96
00:07:57.857 --> 00:08:02.146
then we need the ability
to toggle between Issues.

97
00:08:10.061 --> 00:08:13.410
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And Contributors.

98
00:08:19.706 --> 00:08:21.126
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
just to make it look nice.

99
00:08:34.636 --> 00:08:40.290
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We'll add
a little bit of style afterwards.

100
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:48.489
But one thing I wanna point
out about the link-to,

101
00:08:48.489 --> 00:08:52.010
if we look at the HTML that's generated,

102
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.900
you can see that active is
a class that's added to issues.

103
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:03.820
And if I switch to contributors here,
active will be added to contributors.

104
00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.710
So this is another thing
that sort of comes for free.

105
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:15.780
Link-to out of the box gives you an easy
way to style active state of a link,

106
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.440
because that's a common need, right,
if you're building a nav or something.

107
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.776
So we can actually.

108
00:09:23.006 --> 00:09:29.012
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We'll just go here,
we'll do class = repo-nav,

109
00:09:29.012 --> 00:09:33.796
and here we'll just do some quick stuff.

110
00:09:40.237 --> 00:09:41.117
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And.

111
00:09:53.796 --> 00:09:54.656
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And then by default.

112
00:10:02.456 --> 00:10:06.882
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, so
now we've got some semblance of a nav.

113
00:10:10.763 --> 00:10:14.790
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Where we can clearly
see some active state here.

114
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:18.616
And last thing I'm gonna do is go to
Contributors, and just put something here.

115
00:10:24.956 --> 00:10:27.906
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And Issues,
and put something here.

116
00:10:33.546 --> 00:10:34.890
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And so
here's what we're left with.

117
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.150
So we can toggle between Issues and
Contributors, and see that

118
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:46.250
only the template sort of below
the nav that we built is changing.

119
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.560
Everything else is left
untouched in the dom.

120
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:56.660
So if we go back to the list of orgs, we
go to Ember, we go to an individual org,

121
00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:02.890
and now as we drill into repo,
this up here will remain untouched.

122
00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:08.010
It's only what's in the outlet of
the thing that we're pivoting on

123
00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:09.800
that will change, right?

124
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.390
And then as we switch here you can see
that only what's below it in that outlet,

125
00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:17.720
that we're pivoting on will change.

126
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.360
Does that make sense to everybody?

127
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:23.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
then the URL isn't changing either.

128
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.010
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The URL
is actually changing.

129
00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.920
If you look,
let me make it a little wider.

130
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.664
So we're going Issues, Contributors.

131
00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:36.355
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So orgs, we'll go to Ember,

132
00:11:36.355 --> 00:11:43.150
so we're at org/emberjs/repos,
then we'll click on repo.

133
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:47.595
Actually, we've run into the problem.

134
00:11:47.595 --> 00:11:49.700
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I set myself up for

135
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.200
a bug and then I forgot about it.

136
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.120
So, here's the issue.

137
00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.320
When you're building these link-tos, for
example, when we're building a link-to to

138
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.110
go into a repo, the complete URL
has two dynamic segments in it.

139
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:07.330
It has the name of the org and
the name of the repo.

140
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:12.560
And because in my router
I've used id twice,

141
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:19.560
think of it as like a context
that is used to populate the URL.

142
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:24.080
So I have an ID already there and
I use it again, and

143
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.810
it's basically, it's the same value.

144
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:34.000
So if I just change this to like repoid,
and

145
00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.720
I go here and then react-native.

146
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.830
Now you can see that we have the URL
that we're supposed to have.

147
00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:44.470
Good catch and thank you for not letting
me forget the trap that I set for myself.

148
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:52.280
So, I just want to check back
at what we set out to do here.

149
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.107
So, we've got-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What is the scope for

150
00:12:56.107 --> 00:12:56.636
the id?

151
00:12:56.636 --> 00:12:58.316
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The scope?

152
00:12:58.316 --> 00:13:01.535
I'm not sure what you mean.

153
00:13:01.535 --> 00:13:06.556
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Just in the hierarchy
of the directory structure.

154
00:13:06.556 --> 00:13:07.376
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So.

155
00:13:08.856 --> 00:13:13.361
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The dynamic segment I

156
00:13:13.361 --> 00:13:17.850
would not try to connect that
to the directory structure.

157
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:23.330
It is simply a place holder for
a dynamic value of some sort,

158
00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:28.980
anything other than a forward slash,
that pertains only to URL.

159
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.630
And part of what a router does,

160
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:36.900
is it decouples your code
from the URL to some degree.

161
00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:41.870
So the way your routes are structured,
the hierarchy of the routes, matters a lot

162
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:47.870
more in terms of how your code is
organized than to the actual URL itself.

163
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:54.680
And this is a powerful place where you
can have control over that relationship.
