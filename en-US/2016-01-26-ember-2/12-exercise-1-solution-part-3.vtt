00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.687
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.687 --> 00:00:07.080
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And the last thing we had
to do was have a catch all for not found.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.360
I'm going to do this without Ember CLI.

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.460
So it is the last route I define
in my router dot map hook here.

5
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.300
And that means it's the lowest priority.

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.380
And essentially, anything that
doesn't match everything above it

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.430
will fall through to this route here.

8
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.658
Let me just finish code here.

9
00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:36.880
Not found path and user star segment here.

10
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.320
And I'm just gonna, I have a build error.

11
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.470
Let's see, I forgot a comma.

12
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.206
Another great feature of Ember CLI,

13
00:00:45.206 --> 00:00:50.900
it's literally pointing at
my mistake with an arrow.

14
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.520
It gives you great feedback if you
make little mistakes like that.

15
00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.250
So i'm gonna type some nonsense,
and if we look at the console.

16
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.970
We're not spinning out
an unrecognized URL error any more.

17
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.930
So the application, and

18
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.590
in fact if we go to the Ember
inspector I don't know if you notice.

19
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.740
But previously when I
typed in a garbage URL,

20
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.120
the app kind of just fell apart,
it had no way to handle it.

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.440
In this case the app's still running
the Ember inspector can connect to it.

22
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.783
So all I have to do now is create a file,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: In

23
00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:33.208
my templates folder called not found and

24
00:01:33.208 --> 00:01:40.910
we'll just,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Put Oops.

25
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.710
And there you go.

26
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.500
So now whatever I type in
even if it's deeply nested.

27
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.578
Even if I do like-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But

28
00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:53.520
you lost all the navigation to the.

29
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.670
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I lost all the what?

30
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.440
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You lost all
the navigation from the previous.

31
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.440
&gt;&gt; Mike North: However if we were to
put something in application.hps.

32
00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.540
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That's still
surrounding everything.

33
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.740
And so if we chose to have some
global navigation in our app,

34
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.540
we could do this here.

35
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.540
Furthermore, right now we're in very
close alignment with Ember's conventions

36
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.180
and there is an opportunity
where if you wanted to

37
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.580
render a different view like I could just
as easily if I go back to my router here.

38
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.530
I could just as easily put this in
like orgs/notfound and I can even

39
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:47.360
have a dynamic segment I can have a star
segment that's like Inside the hierarchy.

40
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.560
I could put one here which
would actually take precedence.

41
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.830
So you can use these and
have like a local not found page, right?

42
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.370
And when we get into loading and
Ember sub-states,

43
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.010
we'll see how within the hierarchy,
you know,

44
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.080
if I type in a repo name into the URL
that does not belong to that org.

45
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.570
And we're when we're actually
requesting data from Gethub and

46
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.670
the API returns a 404 we'll see how
we can handle that in a specific way.

47
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.900
And let all other errors like if Gethub
throws a 500 and is crashing or something.

48
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:27.450
Handle that in a generic way.

49
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's worth pointing out
because I just told myself by doing it

50
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.511
that if you change the dynamic segment
of the repo route to repo_id, Ember

51
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.410
attempts to load the repo model which
does not exist and throws an error.

52
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.380
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yes, so just to be clear,
if we did this, you're walking into

53
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.400
another Ember idiom that in
this case we don't want to do.

54
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.270
And that's why I'm
deliberately doing this.

55
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.360
So this means something
special to Ember data or

56
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.060
it will try to be a good guy and
do something nice for you.

57
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.910
And we'll get there.

58
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.400
But for
now I'm skirting around that idiom.

59
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.712
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Thank you for
pointing that out.

60
00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:18.510
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so I'm going to
delete this temporary modification

61
00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.890
application dot hbs, not the outlet.

62
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.650
Do you guys buy the outlet
it does what I say it does.

63
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.030
So if we go to org.hbs and
I delete outlet here.

64
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:42.900
It's just not gonna render
any child template ever.

65
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.120
This is like the end of the line.

66
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:52.710
And if I were to move that above we're
going to get the child template up there.

67
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.620
So it gets sort of where it sort of
propagates down through the hierarchy.

68
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.940
All right now we're at a state
where I'm going to commit this.

69
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.930
This is the solution exercise number one.

70
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.620
We can go ISSUES,

71
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.140
CONTRIBUTORS, back to the list of orgs,
everything kind of works nicely.

72
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.400
Although all of the data is wrong but
we'll get there.

73
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.280
Alright so, I think this is a good
time for a little break, and

74
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.210
the next topic we are gonna jump into
Is dealing with individual routes.

75
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.620
So right now we've been using
empty default routes that,

76
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.220
they don't do nothing, but
they do sort of nothing interesting.

77
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.470
And we're going to get
into customizing them and

78
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.580
taking this hard coded
data out of your template.

79
00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.410
And moving it into the JavaScript and

80
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.330
eventually we'll start relying on
a real data source after that.
