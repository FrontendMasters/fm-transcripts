[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:06.820
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're going
to take what we've built,

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.523
which is hard-coded data in routes,

4
00:00:09.523 --> 00:00:15.880
pretty generalized handlebars templates
that are using h to iterate over lists.

5
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.720
And now we're going to switch to getting
a real data from the GitHub public API.

6
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.850
So I want you guys to leave the orgs page,
which is your hard-coded list of orgs.

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.427
Leave that as is and
we're going to make it so

8
00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:42.615
everything downstream of that is
actually getting data from an API.

9
00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:47.681
Remember how to use modelFor because
in order to build some of these URLs,

10
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:51.196
you will not have complete
information in the model

11
00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:55.139
hook to do what you need to be able to do,
to build the URL.

12
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.474
Pay attention to what
you want to give Ember.

13
00:01:02.474 --> 00:01:07.169
Pay attention to id and
take a look at GitHub's returning and

14
00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:12.415
make adjustments as appropriate so
that things work the way you want

15
00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:17.530
to them to work.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

16
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.970
this is a literal example here.

17
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.260
You can see that they're
gonna return a numeric id.

18
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.882
And my suggestion here, although you guys
can take whatever approach you like,

19
00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:37.080
is I've just moved id to oldId and

20
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.370
copied the name parameter, which is
the name of this repository into id.

21
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.874
So I haven't actually
lost information here.

22
00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:53.430
I've just made a little swap so that I can
use this and link to the way I would like.

23
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.780
And this is very common to have to
do something like this in Ember.

24
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.520
Anytime you have a highly opinionated
convention-oriented framework,

25
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.090
there will be some work in dealing
with things that don't align with it.

26
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.090
And, oftentimes, you don't have
the perfect API to talk to with Ember.

27
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.838
So, this is something that is
a common thing to have to deal with.

28
00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:21.570
So here's an example.

29
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.658
This is like the error function version
of what I just described which is

30
00:02:27.658 --> 00:02:33.330
create this oldId property equal to the id
and the collaborate id with the name.

31
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.800
And, effectively,
that will take you from the top thing,

32
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.709
which is what GitHub tells you, to the
bottom thing, which is what Ember wants.

33
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.899
And remember that promises chain?

34
00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:47.392
And so the fact that I'm returning
raw from inside the callback to then,

35
00:02:47.392 --> 00:02:53.064
that means that, ultimately, if I were
to return this form my model hook,

36
00:02:53.064 --> 00:02:57.927
I would be returning the JSON on
the bottom example with oldId and

37
00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:01.110
with the id as the text, name of the repo.

38
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.709
And, finally,
I've done your research for you guys,

39
00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.940
and here is a cheat sheet for
endpoints that you may find useful.

40
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.060
GitHub, for these endpoints,
requires no authentication,

41
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.600
you don't have to worry about that.

42
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.630
You can just use your browser if you
want and kind of poke around and

43
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.940
see how it works.
