00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:01.080
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.912
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
you guys checked out a project

3
00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:11.239
that I've published.

4
00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:15.982
But I'm actually going to the process of
setting up a brand new Git repository.

5
00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:20.878
A brand new Ember project just to
sort of convince you that I didn't

6
00:00:20.878 --> 00:00:24.114
set you up with some meticulously crafted,

7
00:00:24.114 --> 00:00:29.830
magical thing that you're not gonna
be able to do when you walk away.

8
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.340
So first, Ember CLI is just a command
that you use in your terminal.

9
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.730
And if you do ember -v,
can everyone see this, by the way?

10
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.950
All right, so
ember- v tells us it's working.

11
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.180
We can also look for help.

12
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.094
Which gives you information about all
of the different things Ember CLI does.

13
00:00:56.094 --> 00:01:01.340
The thing we're going to use it for
right now is code generation,

14
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.870
to give us a working application
as a starting point.

15
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.625
And we're also gonna use it for
a development web server,

16
00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:14.366
which has baked into it
an ASP.NET pipeline with Babel

17
00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:17.823
as the transpiler and [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You have some text

18
00:01:17.823 --> 00:01:19.736
highlights that I can't really see.

19
00:01:19.736 --> 00:01:20.658
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thankfully,

20
00:01:20.658 --> 00:01:25.506
I don't think we're gonna run into
that when I'm actually doing things.

21
00:01:25.506 --> 00:01:27.956
I don't wanna attempt to make
that better with LiveShare.

22
00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:35.608
[LAUGH] So the way you create
a new project is using ember new,

23
00:01:35.608 --> 00:01:40.365
I'm just gonna call it github-ui.

24
00:01:40.365 --> 00:01:45.235
So, what's happening here is Ember CLI
has this concept of a blueprint and

25
00:01:45.235 --> 00:01:48.636
it's really just a template for
an application, or

26
00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:51.981
a piece of an application,
or even for an add-on.

27
00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:56.912
If you look at the internals of Ember CLI,
it's really just a folder containing

28
00:01:56.912 --> 00:02:02.780
files with sort of placeholders for
certain things, blanks that get filled in.

29
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.540
And in this case,
relating to the name of my application.

30
00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.240
We'll see that popping
up in a couple places.

31
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.320
So that's sort of abstracted
out inside Ember CLI.

32
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.927
It's gonna download the set
of dependencies from NPM, and

33
00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:23.310
I'll follow that by going to bower and
doing the same thing.

34
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.000
And then what we'll be left with is,
a completely set up Ember application.

35
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.380
And it also initializes git as well,
just forgot about that.

36
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.472
And I'm actually just to save myself
some characters in the terminal,

37
00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:44.446
I'm gonna move
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

38
00:02:44.446 --> 00:02:47.154
I'm just gonna call it the letter g.

39
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.501
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, and I'm
actually gonna rename my master branch.

40
00:03:00.061 --> 00:03:01.280
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Perfect.

41
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.130
All right, so, m is for master.

42
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.330
If we look at our files here.

43
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.440
Wherever we've got the app folder and
we've got the tests folder.

44
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.370
So I'm going to install
some Ember addons here, so

45
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.514
we're going to add Sass support
because writing CSS is tiresome.

46
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.046
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And so what this is doing
it is sort of Ember install is built on

47
00:03:34.046 --> 00:03:35.910
top of NPM install.

48
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.328
What it does in addition to NPM
install is it lets the Ember

49
00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:46.190
addon make changes to your app
potentially confirming along the way

50
00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.630
that each change is appropriate so that
you can have some initial setup or maybe

51
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.270
it needs to introduce an extra dependency,
or it needs to setup some configuration.

52
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.980
But essentially, it gives the addon
the hook where after NPM installs happen,

53
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.165
it will run this and
give you some post install setup

54
00:04:04.165 --> 00:04:07.350
opportunity as the author
of one of these libraries.

55
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.314
So now we have Sass installed, and
if we look at what happened here,

56
00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:17.032
all we did was add something to
package.json and install it.

57
00:04:17.032 --> 00:04:19.281
So this one was relatively simple.

58
00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:23.917
I'm also gonna install Bourbon which
is just a little Sass library.

59
00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:26.435
I don't actually expect that
we're gonna use it, but

60
00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:30.170
it's a better example of an addon that
actually tries to make a modification.

61
00:04:36.253 --> 00:04:43.598
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So again, going to NPM, and
then we're gonna see it suggest a change.

62
00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:45.663
Ooops, sorry, I made a mistake there.

63
00:04:59.994 --> 00:05:04.560
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, just to
describe what happened there, by default,

64
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.307
Ember has this file app.css,
it's sort of the root stylesheet.

65
00:05:09.307 --> 00:05:11.820
You would sort of import
everything from there.

66
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.010
I forgot to rename it here.

67
00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:19.800
And, when installing Bourbon, it assumes
that I'd already done that step there,

68
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.520
that I'd already been working
in the context of SCSS.

69
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.880
So I think installing it again,
we will see something different.

70
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.350
Perfect.

71
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.414
All right, so here's an example
where this Library Bourbon has said,

72
00:05:37.414 --> 00:05:42.466
I want to do something to app.scss and
Ember CLI is giving me

73
00:05:42.466 --> 00:05:47.534
the opportunity to accept or
reject the suggested change.

74
00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:51.494
And it's not,
it is making a change to a file but

75
00:05:51.494 --> 00:05:55.060
you have to think of it
as replacing a file.

76
00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.280
And so, we can look at what it's
trying to do by hitting d for diff.

77
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.490
All it's doing is it's actually
importing the Bourbon stylesheet itself

78
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.350
into my app.scss so
I can actually use this thing.

79
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.060
And I can hit yes here and

80
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.920
I will accept what this library
says my app.scss should look like.

81
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.330
What I wanna make sure you guys
realize here is, as your app grows,

82
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.410
like if I had styles that already
existed here, this would blow it away.

83
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.261
And so more likely the not,
the use here is to look at this to

84
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:36.480
manually make that change to my file,
right?

85
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.590
Until sort of you can see that
you've incorporated what it says

86
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.170
you should incorporate and then decline
to actually so you would hit no here.

87
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:50.100
I'm gonna hit yes because we haven't done
anything, we have nothing to blow away.

88
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:58.140
And so it's telling us it overwrote
app.scss and we're good to go.

89
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.838
All right, so I'm gonna go back
out to the root of the app here.

90
00:07:05.838 --> 00:07:11.025
Also, if we look at bower.json

91
00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:16.340
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sorry.

92
00:07:19.203 --> 00:07:26.241
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, you'll see that we
have ember 1.13.7 and ember-data 1.13.8.

93
00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:31.773
This is because Ember CLI has not
released its 2.0 version quite yet.

94
00:07:31.773 --> 00:07:37.166
You can use the 2.0 versions just fine,
so I'm just going to explicitly

95
00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:42.240
install the beta versions of
the framework at ember-data right now.

96
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:49.608
And the way you do that
is bower install --save,

97
00:07:49.608 --> 00:07:54.880
ember#beta ember-data#beta.

98
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:00.271
Beta is the name of a release channel.

99
00:08:00.271 --> 00:08:04.299
So, makes it 1, 1.

100
00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:09.178
And so, essentially this is like
the latest beta release plus any patches

101
00:08:09.178 --> 00:08:12.259
from critical bug fixes
that have been found.

102
00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.025
And so, if we look at our bower.json now,
we've got the beta version of Ember, and

103
00:08:18.025 --> 00:08:20.726
then we've got the beta
version of Ember-data.

104
00:08:20.726 --> 00:08:27.121
All right, this is what you guys checked
out, that's the state we're in right now.

105
00:08:27.121 --> 00:08:31.113
So, I'm gonna fire it up, and
I'm gonna use this left side here

106
00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:39.304
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You'll see why I'm split

107
00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:39.860
screening.

108
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.540
So ember s, s is for serve.

109
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.680
If you've used Rails,
it's basically the same thing as rails s.

110
00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.600
So it's starting up
the development web server.

111
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.810
I'm sorry it looks so funky here but,
typically it looks more.

112
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.010
So these lines are wrapping.

113
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:04.500
It's giving you some information
about how long the build,

114
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.620
each step of the build process took.

115
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:12.840
So we can see that this
ConcatWithMaps step took 2.2 seconds.

116
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.170
Babel took only two-tenths of a second.

117
00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.582
And if we go to.

118
00:09:21.582 --> 00:09:24.016
Let me bring another desktop
over here real quick.

119
00:09:30.784 --> 00:09:36.980
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So if we go to Localhost
4200, we can see Welcome to Ember.

120
00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.420
So, our app is running now,
it's serving, yes.

121
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.372
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: There is one in it,

122
00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:45.080
should they be following along
updating their installs with all this?

123
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.807
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The state that I'm in
right now is what you are in if you

124
00:09:49.807 --> 00:09:54.601
checked out the repository
from the setup instructions.

125
00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:57.556
But I wanted you guys to
understand how I got there so

126
00:09:57.556 --> 00:10:01.839
I didn't cheat you out of the sort of
setting up from scratch experience.

127
00:10:01.839 --> 00:10:02.869
At the same time,

128
00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:07.215
I don't want 100 people NPM installing
the same thing at the same time.

129
00:10:07.215 --> 00:10:07.715
[LAUGH]
