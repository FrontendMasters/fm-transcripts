00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.155
&gt;&gt; Michael: This exercise,
building on top of what we just did,

3
00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:13.900
I want to componentize
a few things in our app.

4
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.005
I want to componentize two things.

5
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:21.520
One is a github-org and
one is a github-repo.

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.800
And these are just gonna be
basically the contents of your

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.010
each loops in your templates.

8
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.050
We're gonna move away from explicitly
saying an LI with a link in it

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.119
to this URL and we're instead going to
have a component for each of those.

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.142
And what we're gonna do after making
sure the favorite behavior still works,

11
00:00:48.142 --> 00:00:53.016
you should continue to see
the console.log stuff working.

12
00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:54.525
When you click favorite,

13
00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:58.030
you should see a list growing
that you log out to the console.

14
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.437
And, additionally,
I want you to increase the complexity

15
00:01:04.437 --> 00:01:11.051
of the repo component by just printing
out to the screen the number of forks and

16
00:01:11.051 --> 00:01:15.755
the number of watchers on
each repository in the list.

17
00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:21.600
And I think it's just watchers_count and
forks_count.

18
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.250
Those are the attributes available
on the object we get from GitHub.

19
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.630
So I wanna make sure that
there's ample time for

20
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.950
people to get through this themselves.

21
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.580
So let's allow 20 minutes for this.

22
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.340
Any questions?

23
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's one in chat.

24
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.550
How can a component communicate
to a parent and vice versa?

25
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.940
&gt;&gt; Michael: To a parent component.

26
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: To a parent component,
yes sir.

27
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.930
&gt;&gt; Michael: Yes.

28
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.680
So the typical way of doing that is,

29
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.510
well, let me start by saying encapsulation
is important and to start carrying

30
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.120
about what your parent is is a little bit
dangerous because it breaks encapsulation.

31
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.550
So the proper way to do this, if you
remember when we each over something,

32
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.800
we have that local variable for
the current item in the list.

33
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.060
Typically, you'll want to pass your
parent component to your children, right?

34
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.310
You wanna pass the instance
of it to your children so

35
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.930
that it's available for them to use, and
I will show you what that looks like.

36
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.240
So we just make some space here.

37
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.980
You would do something like this.

38
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.145
&gt;&gt; [COUGH]

39
00:02:56.563 --> 00:02:58.000
&gt;&gt; Michael: If that makes sense there.

40
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.120
So there are alternate approaches
to doing this that involve

41
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.830
traversing upwards through
either the component hierarchy,

42
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.400
which is a JavaScript understanding
of the organization of components,

43
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.120
or worse yet, traversing through
the DOM and then trying to look

44
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.230
in the view registry of like
looking up an Ember view by ID.

45
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.860
These are both pretty brittle.

46
00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.030
And add-ons that have taken
approaches like that have

47
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.540
broken as those private APIs have changed.

48
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.830
What you have here will absolutely work.

49
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:44.294
And so there's a way that you can
yield this out of a component.

50
00:03:44.294 --> 00:03:48.870
You can make that available
within this block scope here,

51
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.550
right, just the same way that each works.

52
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.040
And then you can pass that to
any children explicitly so

53
00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.630
that you're still playing
by the rules here.

54
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.100
You're still passing things
through the contract

55
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.870
to make them available
to the child component.
