[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:08.380
&gt;&gt; Mike: So, we were describing
earlier the anatomy of an Ember app.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.410
And I told you most of your time will
be spent in app here, and in tests.

4
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.300
So I wanna show you, so
in tests you've got a folder here called

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.100
the unit that's where your
unit tests are gonna go.

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.770
You've got this folder called
helpers which we'll get into later.

7
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.140
But this is just all stuff
that pertains to testing.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.651
So we're going to live in app for now.

9
00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:33.430
I'm going to close this.

10
00:00:39.561 --> 00:00:41.280
&gt;&gt; Mike: And let's look at templates.

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.510
So, from the start, we've got this
thing called application.hbs.

12
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.570
Remember, this is always visible.

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.740
No matter what URL we're on for our app.

14
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.960
No matter which routes are active,
this is always visible.

15
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.833
And there is actually something
I want everyone to do right now.

16
00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.740
There's a Chrome plug in
called the Ember Inspector.

17
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.440
If you just search for
Ember Inspector and install it to Chrome,

18
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.980
it should just take a second.

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.870
That'll give you some
insight into what's going on.

20
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.790
And if you don't like Chrome it's
also available as a bookmarklet.

21
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.170
You can use it in any browser or

22
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.060
mobile device, but
it's the easiest setup on Chrome.

23
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.576
So what I wanna show you guys is that
when we make changes here and save them,

24
00:01:29.576 --> 00:01:30.588
so if we change.

25
00:01:33.997 --> 00:01:36.535
&gt;&gt; Mike: If we change that text and
I'm gonna hit Save.

26
00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:43.630
&gt;&gt; Mike: We've got live reload working,
monitoring that our file has changed.

27
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.010
And the the build pipeline will
take those incremental changes,

28
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.190
it'll recompile this template,
and then refresh the window here.

29
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.750
So this is actually how I like to work.

30
00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.060
When I use two monitors,
I have visible app, and then my code.

31
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.700
And I really am just looking at the app
itself, it's a pretty nice workflow.

32
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.930
So if we look at router.js,
we've got nothing in router.map,

33
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.540
we've got no routes to find.

34
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.420
And yet,
if we open up our Ember Inspector here,

35
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.200
I'm gonna have so much fun with this
stupid little split screening today.

36
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.270
Ha.
Ember, and

37
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.440
I'm gonna go to this Routes tab here and
look at a Current Route only.

38
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.150
So you can see that we're
at application Index.

39
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.670
And apologies if this is getting
a little too small to read.

40
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.640
But, over here to the right
you see this URL column.

41
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.270
So this Chrome plugin will give you
a good idea of when the app starts up,

42
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.860
what is it actually seeing.

43
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.510
And so if you have some weirdness
where a URL is taking you to

44
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.680
something other than what you expect.

45
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.900
Great debugging tool for this.

46
00:03:00.196 --> 00:03:02.185
So what I'm gonna do is create a route and

47
00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:05.765
then create a couple link to's so
you guys get the idea of how that looks.

48
00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:13.757
&gt;&gt; Mike: So
I'm going to back to ember.cli.

49
00:03:13.757 --> 00:03:16.960
And actually delete this,
and move it over there.

50
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.310
I'm gonna go back here, and I'm going to
use one Ember's code generation features.

51
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.440
And if you type EmberHelpGenerate,
and I'm sorry that this text is so

52
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.250
hard to read, but
I will highlight it for you.

53
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.850
So you can see that it can generate
a lot of different things.

54
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.878
And up at the top its actually
saying that there are some

55
00:03:45.878 --> 00:03:51.660
addons I'm using which have introduced
some new code generation functionality.

56
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.787
That's what this stuff on the top is.

57
00:03:54.787 --> 00:04:01.528
And then ember-cli's generators,
that's what it ships with by default.

58
00:04:01.528 --> 00:04:06.526
So we can generate an app,
which is when we called EmberNew,

59
00:04:06.526 --> 00:04:09.770
that was basically generating an app.

60
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:11.950
We can generate a component.

61
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.994
What we're gonna do now is
we're gonna generate a route.

62
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.970
&gt;&gt; Mike: So it's saying it generates a
route and it registers it with the router.

63
00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.860
So let's give it a try.

64
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.030
Ember g for generate you should
just use the first letter,

65
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.350
route and we're gonna generate home.

66
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.600
So ember-cli is actually
telling you what it's done.

67
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.082
It's created a couple files,
a JavaScript file in the routes folder, so

68
00:04:44.082 --> 00:04:45.498
it's created a route for us.

69
00:04:45.498 --> 00:04:48.480
And we'll get into that after
we're done with this exercise.

70
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.720
Hopefully you don't need it yet.

71
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.090
It's generated the top level template,

72
00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.390
associated with this new route
I've created, which is home.hbs.

73
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.930
And then it's saying that it's updated the
router here, by adding this route home.

74
00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.529
So I actually want to.

75
00:05:13.267 --> 00:05:16.260
&gt;&gt; Mike: To show you that this
is the change that it's made.

76
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.010
It's actually taking care
of adding this for us.

77
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.390
So we didn't have to actually touch
the router, it's made the change for us.

78
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.549
You can actually do nested routes as well.

79
00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:34.509
Like if I did home, and then.

80
00:05:41.493 --> 00:05:45.138
&gt;&gt; Mike: So
I generated a route called home/mike, and

81
00:05:45.138 --> 00:05:48.710
there is my child route popping up.

82
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.500
So you really just have to think
in terms of your structure,

83
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.350
have ember-cli do the work, and
it'll do what it needs to do.

84
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.060
So let's go back to the code, here.

85
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.650
And there are our changes.

86
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.780
I'm gonna shrink this a little bit.

87
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.330
And, I want to look in
the Templates folder.

88
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.042
I've got this home.hbs.

89
00:06:12.042 --> 00:06:14.905
Right now, it's got outlet,

90
00:06:14.905 --> 00:06:20.197
which is the placeholder for
the child routes template.

91
00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:25.162
But I'm gonna add something here so
we can see what happens.

92
00:06:25.162 --> 00:06:25.951
Save it.

93
00:06:30.943 --> 00:06:32.298
&gt;&gt; Mike: And now if I go back here.

94
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.758
&gt;&gt; Mike: /home,

95
00:06:37.758 --> 00:06:42.622
there it is.

96
00:06:42.622 --> 00:06:48.130
So what's going on here if we look at
this other tab of the Ember Inspector

97
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:50.390
which is the view tree so
you can see the hierarchy of views.

98
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.130
This is the home view and then this is the
application view, all the way at the top.

99
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.700
And so you can see how one is
sort of nested within the other.

100
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.199
And if in here we do link to.

101
00:07:14.568 --> 00:07:19.480
&gt;&gt; Mike: We're gonna create a link
called index, I'm gonna change this.

102
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.618
So we know what's the text and
what is the route name.

103
00:07:24.618 --> 00:07:29.480
And if we look at,
it's maybe tough for people to see,

104
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.259
but this is taking you
back to localhost:4000.

105
00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:35.510
And that will take me back here.

106
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.840
And if we hit the back
button we go back and forth.

107
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.174
So here we have two states and

108
00:07:43.174 --> 00:07:46.020
we've used link to to transition
between those two states.

109
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.990
Everyone with me so far?

110
00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.420
Any questions about what we've done?

111
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.060
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm sorry I think I zoned
out when you saw under templates I don't

112
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.900
have a palm directory under there,
I missed that stuff I apologize.

113
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.830
&gt;&gt; Mike: So I have actually not created,
I've done nothing but

114
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.750
touch templates in this editorial.

115
00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.690
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So did you type that then?

116
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.670
&gt;&gt; Mike: home.hbs?

117
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Templates, the home,
the subdirectory home and then the.

118
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:17.983
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right, so
the subdirectory home was created by,

119
00:08:17.983 --> 00:08:25.550
hopefully it didn't blow it away,
it was created at this moment here.

120
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.630
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: When you did that?

121
00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.079
&gt;&gt; Mike: So I added a child [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: See,

122
00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:29.200
I did the same thing and
I didn't get that.

123
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.610
&gt;&gt; Mike: So did you create,
did you run this command here?

124
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.108
Ember g route home/mike or
home slash [CROSSTALK]

125
00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:36.618
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I just used home

126
00:08:36.618 --> 00:08:37.430
mike, as in home.

127
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:44.450
&gt;&gt; Mike: Right, so if you just did home,
you'll end up with home.hbs.

128
00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.530
If you do home/mike what we're saying is,
at that point, if you look back at

129
00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.886
our router, we're adding a child route

130
00:08:54.886 --> 00:09:00.390
to that home route.

131
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:04.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I typed in ember g route
home and the GitHub UI directory.

132
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.020
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes.
&gt;&gt; And

133
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.000
then inside of templates
I've got components.

134
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You don't get
the home directory until you have.

135
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.490
&gt;&gt; Mike: Yeah.

136
00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.910
&gt;&gt; Mike: If we look at
what's inside of it.

137
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I gotcha.

138
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.580
&gt;&gt; Mike: What's inside of it's
going to be like that hbs.

139
00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.440
&gt;&gt; So I need to do the mike.

140
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.920
&gt;&gt; Mike: It's created out of necessity
as soon as you say all right,

141
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.280
we've got a child here.

142
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.630
We need to have structure.
