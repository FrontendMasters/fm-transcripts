&gt;&gt; Mike: Something's been bugging me
about the app we have been building.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.370
And it's that this word favorite on
the screen, it's always favorite.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.920
You don't have it switch to unfavorite
if something's already in the array.

5
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.830
We are not really surfacing the concept
of this has been to the favorite list.

6
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.450
So we're gonna use computer
properties to solve that problem.

7
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.310
We're gonna enhance
the github-org component.

8
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:38.800
And we're gonna add some indication
of a favorited state to the list,

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.423
to each item in the list of orgs,
on the orgs page.

10
00:00:43.423 --> 00:00:47.660
And so you're going to implement
a computer property called isFavorited.

11
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.201
And I want you guys to build a computer
property macro just like sum,

12
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:54.440
which I've just showed you.

13
00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.370
We will call it isInArray, and
you'll pass the name of a property and

14
00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.810
then the name of another property,
which is the list of items to look through

15
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.860
to try to detect whether
the item's in the array.

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.350
And I want you to use that
property in the template for

17
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.930
your github-org component to alternate
between the word Favorite and Unfavorite.

18
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.250
So if you click something, it'll toggle,

19
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.920
indicating that it's favorited and
you can toggle it again.

20
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.912
And now we'll be finally be surfacing
this thing that we added yesterday,

21
00:01:28.912 --> 00:01:30.490
this favorited state to the user.
