2
00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:08.698
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So I'd like to start by
recapping what we covered yesterday just

3
00:00:08.698 --> 00:00:13.076
to let everyone kind of refresh
their memory as to where we stand.

4
00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:16.480
And then go over what
I hope to cover today.

5
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.730
And I'm definitely prepared
to stay a little bit later

6
00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.670
in the interest of making sure
we give you guys a complete

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.730
set of skills that you can
use to build a real app.

8
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.450
So yesterday we began with talking
about the ideas behind Ember,

9
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.230
what makes it different from some of
the other web frameworks out there.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.320
We described the anatomy of an Ember app,
all of the different folders.

11
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.790
And as we've gone through some of these
exercises, I hope you're starting to get

12
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.790
an intuition for where you can find
things, and starting to figure out

13
00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.250
the naming conventions in which template
corresponds to a given route and so on.

14
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.640
We spent a lot of time going
over routing and routes.

15
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.890
We talked about services,
actions, and then sort of get and

16
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.760
set on objects, which is something that
can broadly be used throughout Ember.

17
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.180
We started talking to the Github API,
just using jquery and A plus promises.

18
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.600
Returning those from the model hook so
that we could take hard coded data

19
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.470
out of our template and
start using something real.

20
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.050
And then where we left was we went
over loading and error substates,

21
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.190
and I'm actually gonna start going over
that again since we had a little hiccup.

22
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.560
And I want to make sure
that you guys get it and

23
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.890
that we can go through a simple
example really quickly.

24
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.070
So after that, today we're going to get
into two concepts which help you extend

25
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.010
the semantics that are available
in your templates.

26
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.985
And those two ways are building
Ember components and

27
00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:04.840
creating your own Handlebars Helpers.

28
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.620
And you can think of those as
sort of custom dom elements and

29
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.240
then helper functions that
are used to create strings or

30
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.722
expressions that can be used
in various different ways.

31
00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.430
We'll follow that by talking about
computed properties of very powerful and

32
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.160
highly emphasized concept in
the number two point x idioms.

33
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.400
And then jump into testing.

34
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.980
We'll cover unit tests, component
integration tests, acceptance tests.

35
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.698
We will cover how to mock EPI responses,
in case you want to test your app in

36
00:02:43.698 --> 00:02:48.784
isolation without worrying about
whether your API is up or down.

37
00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:54.251
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Then,
we'll get into ember-data.

38
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:58.302
We'll talk about models, the store,
adapters, serializers, relationships,

39
00:02:58.302 --> 00:03:00.139
attributes, those kinds of things.

40
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.890
And then finally, I wanna close
out by giving you guys an idea for

41
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.825
what's coming in Ember.

42
00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:14.350
This could be stuff that is likely
to lend in two point x release or

43
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.420
even a three point release, but because
this is a continually evolving framework,

44
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.990
especially when weighing
whether to use Ember or

45
00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:29.040
whether to have your own
custom set of some sort.

46
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.810
It's important to know where things
are going and what you may be able to take

47
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.200
advantage of so you can decide how much
value that's gonna be for your team.
