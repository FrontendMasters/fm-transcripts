WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.373
I'm just gonna brief this,

2
00:00:01.373 --> 00:00:04.689
Wget is a command that I'm gonna show
you very briefly how to use, but

3
00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.567
I wanna show you another one
that I like better called cURL.

4
00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:10.184
And I think cURL is a better
command to Wget, but

5
00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:13.522
again when you're like googling around and
you find stuff,

6
00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:16.614
you're gonna find stuff that
has Wget in it quite a bit.

7
00:00:16.614 --> 00:00:19.145
And it does do some useful things.

8
00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:21.528
So I just want you to know what it is,
know how to use it, and

9
00:00:21.528 --> 00:00:23.300
then we're gonna spend more time on cURL.

10
00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:30.177
So Wget and cURL, they're two ways
of getting a remote file, right?

11
00:00:30.177 --> 00:00:34.683
And not in the sense of SFTP where
you're moving things across the network.

12
00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:38.176
What you're doing with Wget is like,
there is a file on GitHub and

13
00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:40.344
I want to go download that file, right?

14
00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:42.632
So you're basically downloading
something typically from the Internet.

15
00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:46.233
It would work on a local network as well,
but in our case,

16
00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:49.321
we're just gonna be doing
it from the Internet.

17
00:00:51.099 --> 00:00:54.626
So I'm gonna show you where we're on here.

18
00:00:54.626 --> 00:00:58.433
So we're down here in Wget,
this one right here.

19
00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:01.996
And we're going to go download a game,
a bash game off the Internet.

20
00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:05.195
So this GitHub user right here,

21
00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:11.124
mydzo created a bash version
of the game 2048, right?

22
00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:13.361
Have you played 2048?

23
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:15.027
I've played it way too much on my phone.

24
00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:19.373
I have gotten 2048,
that's how much I've played that game.

25
00:01:19.373 --> 00:01:22.798
And someone's gonna come here and
say, well I got like 19,000,

26
00:01:22.798 --> 00:01:24.008
I was like you know what?

27
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:24.931
Okay, weird flex, but okay, sure.

28
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:29.831
So this user created 2048,
we're gonna go download it.

29
00:01:29.831 --> 00:01:31.578
And so
we're gonna run this command right here.

30
00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:34.713
So you can copy and paste this if
you want to, or you can write it in.

31
00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:38.791
I have forked it to my GitHub repo just
because in the past when I create these

32
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:42.243
courses, people will change things,
and I don't want that.

33
00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:46.463
So it's exactly the code that this user
wrote, so all credit goes to them.

34
00:01:46.463 --> 00:01:49.091
And so you're just gonna be
getting it from my GitHub,

35
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:51.962
so that I can make sure that
this stays stable in the future.

36
00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:55.092
Okay, so I'm gonna copy that.

37
00:01:55.092 --> 00:01:57.882
You can even put it in
here if you wanna see it,

38
00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:00.900
I'm not going to steal
all of your credentials.

39
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.042
Man, that would have been a great
lesson that I could have taught people.

40
00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:07.488
I could have totally made this like
some sort of thing which is like,

41
00:02:07.488 --> 00:02:12.089
you've been hacked, and have like a skull
show up, like 1990s hacker kind of thing.

42
00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:14.961
Missed opportunities,
I guess I still could after this course.

43
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:18.961
I could go in there and I could change it
and just scare the hell out of people, and

44
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:20.659
teach them a very strong lesson.

45
00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:22.573
But then, I don't know,
somebody's gonna get upset.

46
00:02:22.573 --> 00:02:24.741
I mean, somebody's gonna get
upset anyway that I didn't do it.

47
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:26.704
Anyway, we can see here, this is the game.

48
00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:29.723
And I went through it line by line,
this is fine, you can run it.

49
00:02:29.723 --> 00:02:32.174
I'm gonna run it right now for you.

50
00:02:32.174 --> 00:02:38.204
Anyway, so I'm gonna cut and
paste that in here at Wget.

51
00:02:38.204 --> 00:02:41.379
And what this is just gonna do is
it's gonna go out to the Internet,

52
00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.294
it's gonna download this file, and it's
going to just leave it with the same name

53
00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:47.642
that it came in as, which is bash2048.sh.

54
00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:52.160
So if I run that, you can see there
it's gonna go out, it's gonna connect,

55
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.902
it's gonna download it, and
you can see at the end of this, and

56
00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:58.674
I put the file here called bash2048.sh.

57
00:02:58.674 --> 00:02:59.892
Right, make sense?

58
00:03:02.777 --> 00:03:07.486
So if you look at the permissions on this
file though, by default even though it's

59
00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:12.075
a .sh file, you still have to give it
permissions to be an executable, right?

60
00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.105
Cuz this is a file that you can run.

61
00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.704
So you can do one of two things.

62
00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:20.043
You can either say bash2048 like that, and

63
00:03:20.043 --> 00:03:24.707
you can actually pipe at
it directly in the bash, or

64
00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:30.782
we can make this an executable
file by saying chmod either 700 or

65
00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:36.661
we could do +x,
I hope we'll just do +x, bash2048.sh.

66
00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:42.003
So now if we look again at it,
you can see that it's nice and green.

67
00:03:42.003 --> 00:03:45.706
That's because my LS color show
things that are executable as green.

68
00:03:45.706 --> 00:03:52.242
And you can see here now it has executable
permissions for everybody, right?

69
00:03:52.242 --> 00:04:00.388
So now I can just save bash2048.sh.

70
00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.672
Dot rather.

71
00:04:05.672 --> 00:04:11.194
And you can see here I am actually
now running 2048 in my command line,

72
00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:13.517
which is pretty cool, right?

73
00:04:13.517 --> 00:04:17.431
So now you're gonna have to sit here and
watch me play this until I lose.

74
00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:20.298
So you might be here, well,
you might wanna grab like a sandwich.

75
00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:24.616
I'm just kidding,
no one wants to see that.

76
00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:25.672
But that's pretty cool, right?

77
00:04:25.672 --> 00:04:28.507
We were able to download this
using Wget off the Internet, and

78
00:04:28.507 --> 00:04:30.154
now we can start playing it in here.

79
00:04:30.154 --> 00:04:33.421
I thought it was pretty cool, okay?

80
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:37.851
So now, I mean you are welcome to
like abandon ship on this course and

81
00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:41.987
just play this for the rest of
your life or maybe not suggest it.

82
00:04:41.987 --> 00:04:44.704
But I think then that we
can do a Ctrl &gt; C, and

83
00:04:44.704 --> 00:04:49.057
you can have like the ability to save
the game, I'm just gonna say no.

84
00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:53.809
It says you have lost,
well, that's nice to them.

85
00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:58.792
The thing that was annoying about
this is it does actually totally

86
00:04:58.792 --> 00:05:01.702
exit your shell whenever you finish.

87
00:05:01.702 --> 00:05:05.202
So I've actually totally lost
control of my shell here, so

88
00:05:05.202 --> 00:05:08.670
I actually have to open
another shell here.

89
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.449
Okay, so the point here that you should
be getting is Wget it's like copy,

90
00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:16.487
like CP for the Internet.

91
00:05:16.487 --> 00:05:20.031
You can say, I know of a remote URL
that I want you to go out here and

92
00:05:20.031 --> 00:05:21.946
I want you to copy it here, right?

93
00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:27.437
So you can think of it as like
the network version of CP.

94
00:05:27.437 --> 00:05:33.213
The thing that Wget is not useful for is
it doesn't connect into the pipes, right?.

95
00:05:33.213 --> 00:05:36.456
So that's why I'm gonna show
you cURL next, cuz cURL,

96
00:05:36.456 --> 00:05:40.394
you can pipe things from the Internet
into other programs, right?

97
00:05:40.394 --> 00:05:45.613
Cuz it uses standard in and standard out,
whereas Wget is more like CP, right?

98
00:05:45.613 --> 00:05:50.914
So it's more like file goes here,
file comes here, that kind of thing.

99
00:05:50.914 --> 00:05:53.466
Wget can do all sorts of
other things as well.

100
00:05:53.466 --> 00:05:56.017
It can also do POST requests and
PUT requests, and

101
00:05:56.017 --> 00:05:57.549
all sorts of stuff like that.

102
00:05:57.549 --> 00:05:59.582
However, I'm gonna show you how
to do all that stuff in cURL, so

103
00:05:59.582 --> 00:06:00.909
I'm not gonna show you how to do it twice.

104
00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:05.120
I just wanted you to be
aware that Wget exists.

105
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:10.075
The one thing that Wget does and
that is the reason to know about

106
00:06:10.075 --> 00:06:15.144
Wget that cURL cannot do,
is it can redo recursive downloads.

107
00:06:15.144 --> 00:06:18.600
So imagine there's a website out
there that has a bunch of CSS and

108
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.072
a bunch of JavaScript, and

109
00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:24.182
those things linked out to other files
that link out to other files, right?

110
00:06:24.182 --> 00:06:26.879
And they're kind of like this
web of files that go out.

111
00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:30.171
Wget will actually read through,
find other URLs, and

112
00:06:30.171 --> 00:06:32.423
download those URLs as well, right?

113
00:06:32.423 --> 00:06:36.312
So you can actually recursively
download entire websites using Wget,

114
00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.790
whereas cURL does not
have that capability.

115
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:43.499
So whenever you need to do those sorts
of like go grab me this entire website,

116
00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.803
Wget can do that for you.

117
00:06:45.803 --> 00:06:50.838
Otherwise I would say,
100% of the time just use cURL, cool.

118
00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:52.757
Any questions about Wget?

119
00:06:57.378 --> 00:06:58.799
All right.

120
00:07:01.075 --> 00:07:05.222
Yeah, and again, as always,
you can just say wget dash, dash help.

121
00:07:05.222 --> 00:07:06.926
This will tell you a lot
of stuff that it can do.

122
00:07:06.926 --> 00:07:10.583
You can see that it has
a lot of capabilities here.

123
00:07:12.656 --> 00:07:15.791
So yeah,
again absolutely nothing against Wget.

124
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:18.471
Fantastic program,
it's been around forever,

125
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.227
it's worth knowing about and
knowing where it is.

126
00:07:21.227 --> 00:07:28.123
I just prefer cURL for its ability to plug
into the greater Unix, Linux ecosystem.
