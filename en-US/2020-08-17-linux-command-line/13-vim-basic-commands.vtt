1
00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.138
So let's pop into vim and
learn how to quit cuz I feel like this is

2
00:00:03.138 --> 00:00:06.435
the most important thing that I
might type teach you all day today.

3
00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:10.181
So, let's clear here.

4
00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:17.123
So again, you can type vi or vim,
I'm gonna type vim just because I'm sure

5
00:00:17.123 --> 00:00:20.745
someone's gonna yell at me that vi and
vim are not the same thing.

6
00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:24.987
And I'm gonna say vim txt file which
is the file that I was just editing

7
00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:26.240
with nano, right?

8
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.145
As you can see,
this is the same thing here,

9
00:00:31.145 --> 00:00:34.600
just in vim instead of in nano.

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.013
Now the hard thing about vim is it
doesn't really give you glow or

11
00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:42.623
like visual cues of what you can do and
where you are.

12
00:00:44.343 --> 00:00:45.580
And that can be really tough,

13
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.760
whereas nano's pretty good about showing
you the shortcuts at the bottom.

14
00:00:50.568 --> 00:00:54.920
So the first thing I want to
teach you is how to quit vim.

15
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.122
So the first thing is that vim
has multiple different modes.

16
00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:02.247
So you can be in interactive mode,
you can be in command mode, and

17
00:01:02.247 --> 00:01:06.674
umpteen million more different kinds
of modes we saw in x mode as well.

18
00:01:07.718 --> 00:01:11.717
So the first thing if you hit escape,
and you hit it a couple times,

19
00:01:11.717 --> 00:01:16.095
you'll probably get back to command mode,
which is where you wanna be.

20
00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:19.673
Right now we're already in command mode so
we don't need to hit escape.

21
00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:25.045
And if you hit colon q,
that's how you quit vim.

22
00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:27.720
So that's just important to know upfront.

23
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.933
I feel like if you're gonna go in a door,
you wanna know how to get back out

24
00:01:30.933 --> 00:01:34.537
the door and if you don't know, it's gonna
be like a little bit panic inducing.

25
00:01:34.537 --> 00:01:38.055
So, you can go into vim and
know that you can always get to the exit.

26
00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:43.257
I remember literally when I was working
in my first job, and I did not know how

27
00:01:43.257 --> 00:01:48.783
to use vim, whenever it popped up for a
get merge message or something like that,

28
00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:53.605
I would just close the terminal
because I didn't know how to quit vim.

29
00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:56.947
[LAUGH] So,
that's the first thing, colon q.

30
00:01:56.947 --> 00:01:58.652
That'll get you out of there.

31
00:01:58.652 --> 00:02:02.111
Sometimes it'll say you have unsaved
changes and not let you quit.

32
00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:07.753
If you hit colon q, exclamation point,
that'll let you quit no matter what.

33
00:02:07.753 --> 00:02:12.455
That's like, I don't care about save
changes, just abandon ship, okay?

34
00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:18.032
So, that's the first thing,
know how to quit vim.

35
00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:21.155
I feel like we're all
better people already.

36
00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:22.141
So let's go back into it.

37
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:25.358
Let's actually learn how to use
vim a little bit because for

38
00:02:25.358 --> 00:02:28.443
the most part,
if I have the choice between nano and vim,

39
00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:31.679
I know enough about vim that I
feel okay to write a bit of vim.

40
00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.554
So right now I'm in command mode,

41
00:02:33.554 --> 00:02:36.861
command mode allows you to run
various different commands.

42
00:02:36.861 --> 00:02:39.621
So one that I know all the time,
if I hit colon d,

43
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:43.152
that's actually just going to
delete the line that I'm on.

44
00:02:43.152 --> 00:02:46.608
So there's a bunch of these
kind of different commands.

45
00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:51.113
I'm not gonna show you very many of them
because I don't know very many of them.

46
00:02:51.113 --> 00:02:53.522
But for example, if I wanted to
delete all the lines up here,

47
00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:57.018
I could go to the top line and say d100,
which would delete the next 100 lines, and

48
00:02:57.018 --> 00:02:58.645
it would delete everything in the file.

49
00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:02.308
So that's one of the commands.

50
00:03:02.308 --> 00:03:06.547
Again, there's a great many more,
and I'm sure someone's says,

51
00:03:06.547 --> 00:03:10.785
well if you just hit colon q 15 times 7,
that would have deleted all

52
00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:15.634
those particular lines and you wouldn't
have had to move your cursor so much.

53
00:03:15.634 --> 00:03:19.151
I know, if you wanna learn vim,
don't learn it from me.

54
00:03:21.477 --> 00:03:25.701
But okay, so
now I wanna get into interactive mode or

55
00:03:25.701 --> 00:03:28.200
I want the ability to type now.

56
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.881
So if I hit I, or insert mode,
rather, not interactive,

57
00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:34.151
this will drop me into typing mode.

58
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.212
Where I can say, this is brian,

59
00:03:38.212 --> 00:03:44.084
we're typing in vim now,
this is so much fun.

60
00:03:44.084 --> 00:03:48.884
So that's insert mode and
now I'm done typing, if I hit escape,

61
00:03:48.884 --> 00:03:51.955
this will drop me back into command mode.

62
00:03:51.955 --> 00:03:58.144
Now I can hit colon w and
that will save it.

63
00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:00.014
So that's what colon w does.

64
00:04:00.014 --> 00:04:02.714
And then I can hit colon q and
I'm done and I'm out.

65
00:04:04.954 --> 00:04:08.128
So get back in here one more time.

66
00:04:10.548 --> 00:04:18.003
Frequently what I'll do is I'll come
in here, I'll write some more stuff.

67
00:04:18.003 --> 00:04:22.104
And if you wanna write and quit all at
the same time, which is usually what I do,

68
00:04:22.104 --> 00:04:23.175
you can do colon wq.

69
00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:26.669
All done.

70
00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.900
And then that both wrote and
quit all at the same time.

71
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.365
So that's really about all
I'm gonna show you about vim.

72
00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.591
I don't think we really need to
get much more into it than that.

73
00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:43.149
There's plenty of good course material
out there on vim if you wanna become like

74
00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:43.796
a vim expert.

75
00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:46.963
But for now,

76
00:04:46.963 --> 00:04:51.559
this should be enough of a tutorial
that you're not afraid of vim anymore.

77
00:04:55.236 --> 00:04:57.094
The last thing I will show you,

78
00:04:57.094 --> 00:05:01.468
one, there's a website called- I
think it's called vim adventures.

79
00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:03.798
Yeah, so if you go to vim adventures,
you can just google that.

80
00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:05.620
And there's also a link
in the course notes.

81
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.359
That's a really fun way of learning vim.

82
00:05:10.217 --> 00:05:15.104
And then if you also do help tutor like
this, this will drop you into a vim

83
00:05:15.104 --> 00:05:19.346
tutor that will actually walk
you through of how to learn vim.

84
00:05:22.145 --> 00:05:26.698
So despite the fact that vim people
love to tell you how much they love vim.

85
00:05:26.698 --> 00:05:29.825
They're also a very nice community and
they want people to learn vim so

86
00:05:29.825 --> 00:05:32.105
there's a lot of good
resources out there as well.

87
00:05:34.952 --> 00:05:36.809
Last thing I'm gonna show you.

88
00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:41.417
If you're still having trouble
quitting vim after all this,

89
00:05:41.417 --> 00:05:43.604
because there's still some
weird places you can get in.

90
00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:47.667
If you put colon qa exclamation point,

91
00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:52.846
this will always get you
out 100% of the time.

92
00:05:52.846 --> 00:05:54.965
I don't even remember what the A does.

93
00:05:54.965 --> 00:05:57.438
I think it just says like,
I don't care, just blow everything up.

94
00:05:57.438 --> 00:05:59.792
Just get me the hell out of here.

95
00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:02.508
It's like the nuclear bomb was like,
I want out.

96
00:06:02.508 --> 00:06:05.010
So, that's a good one to
keep in mind as well.

97
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.816
The last one that I feel like
I need to talk about is Emacs.

98
00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:12.045
You can't mention them
without someone peeking

99
00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:18.176
in around the corner, is like,
hey, what about Emacs?

100
00:06:18.176 --> 00:06:23.199
[LAUGH] The reason why I'm not showing you
Emacs is, there's no reason that you'll

101
00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.022
ever be thrust into Emacs that you didn't
mean to get into Emacs as far as I know.

102
00:06:28.022 --> 00:06:33.334
And it's not normally installed
by default in most Linux distros.

103
00:06:33.334 --> 00:06:35.122
So, it's out there.

104
00:06:35.122 --> 00:06:39.405
It's another text editor like I know my
coworker Nina Zakharchenko uses Emacs and

105
00:06:39.405 --> 00:06:42.088
swears by,
it seems like it's a good text editor.

106
00:06:42.088 --> 00:06:44.760
I've just never been thrust into it and
I showed you nano and

107
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.693
vim because you will be thrust into those.

108
00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.482
And you do have to know how to
use those at least a little bit.

109
00:06:49.482 --> 00:06:54.047
So, that's why we're not
talking about Emacs today is

110
00:06:54.047 --> 00:06:57.361
because you don't have to learn Emacs.

111
00:06:57.361 --> 00:06:58.675
You can learn it if you want to.

112
00:06:58.675 --> 00:06:59.835
And so suffice to say,

113
00:06:59.835 --> 00:07:04.065
I don't know anything about Emacs cuz I've
never had to learn anything about it.
