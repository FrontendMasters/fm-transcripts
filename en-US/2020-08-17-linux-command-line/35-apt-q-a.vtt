00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.647
So yeah, I guess one last kinda like wrap
up sort of thing that I want to say,

2
00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:09.694
is APT is actually several
tools combined together.

3
00:00:09.694 --> 00:00:15.058
And so like it's apt get,
its apt remove, its apt update.

4
00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:17.882
So they kind of took all of those
various different tools, and

5
00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:21.484
they wrote APT which is a higher tool on
top of all these like lower level tools.

6
00:00:21.484 --> 00:00:26.483
So under the hood, apt is using apt get,
and it's using apt search, and apt cache,

7
00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:28.470
and a bunch of these other tools.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.723
So you can actually use those tools
directly as well, it's just apt is

9
00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:37.062
meant to be a more user friendly sort
of tool, so that's why it exists.

10
00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:37.903
Mark.

11
00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:41.197
&gt;&gt; What's the difference
between upgrade and update?

12
00:00:41.197 --> 00:00:46.553
&gt;&gt; Good question, what's the difference
between upgrade and update?

13
00:00:46.553 --> 00:00:49.758
So upgrade is actually
going to upgrade a package.

14
00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:55.614
So if I say sudo apt upgrade Node.js, this
is going to go update the Node.js package,

15
00:00:55.614 --> 00:01:01.171
and it's going to say you already have
the latest version, why are you asking me?

16
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:02.549
What is it?

17
00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:03.942
Eight?

18
00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:05.821
That's real sad, notice,

19
00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:11.165
that makes me really sad that it has a
deprecated version of node that installed.

20
00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:14.024
But, that's what it has on this registry,
right?

21
00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:19.266
That is something that I guess
bears mentioning is like,

22
00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:22.531
they're pretty conservative
of how they upgrade packages.

23
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:27.215
So in this case, I do not recommend
installing Node.js through APT, I would

24
00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:32.422
suggest installing it directly from Node
or from NodeSource or something like that.

25
00:01:32.422 --> 00:01:36.000
So that's what upgrade does upgrade,
upgrades a package for you.

26
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.184
Whereas update sudo apt update,

27
00:01:38.184 --> 00:01:42.318
this is going to go get a new
version of the registry basically,

28
00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:47.861
it's going to go up, grab, like, here's
all the latest version of the packages.

29
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:50.255
This isn't actually upgrade any package,

30
00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:53.822
it updates the available packages
that APT has to go get, right?

31
00:01:53.822 --> 00:01:55.787
So it gets a new list.

32
00:01:57.366 --> 00:02:00.508
So you can see it goes out there,
it finds the patch list.

33
00:02:00.508 --> 00:02:04.228
It then rebuilds dependency tree and
it figures everything out that way.

34
00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:06.653
So that yeah,
that's the difference between the two.

35
00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:10.576
So run update, before you're an upgrade.

36
00:02:10.576 --> 00:02:14.324
&gt;&gt; What's the package manager for Mac?

37
00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:19.370
&gt;&gt; Homebrew,
it's like not official, whereas,

38
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.293
like, canonical makes
the package manager for

39
00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:29.227
our mix ATP,
homebrew is a community project.

40
00:02:29.227 --> 00:02:31.771
So I think, it's homebrew.sh.

41
00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.696
Nope.

42
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.834
It's brew.sh.

43
00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:43.900
There's another one called
MacPorts that is much slower,

44
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.514
so I definitely recommend homebrew.

45
00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:53.602
And then you can come in and
say, like brew info Node.js.

46
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.241
Yeah, then you can see this comes
from Node.js.org, blah, blah, blah,

47
00:03:00.241 --> 00:03:02.736
it installs 14.3,
which is a much newer version.

48
00:03:02.736 --> 00:03:06.931
And then probably the next question
would be what's the one for Windows?

49
00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:11.611
Microsoft just launched their new package
manager and it is called winget or

50
00:03:11.611 --> 00:03:16.582
winget, depending on who you ask, it is
winget that's what the intention was,

51
00:03:16.582 --> 00:03:18.942
but I'm quite happy with the winget.

52
00:03:18.942 --> 00:03:21.899
There was also Chocolatey as well, but

53
00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:27.287
that's kind of like the existing one,
whereas when we get the new one.

54
00:03:27.287 --> 00:03:32.926
&gt;&gt; It's APT and it's registries are all
open source versus like, Node and

55
00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:38.761
npm is there's a company behind
the registry, is it, how does that work?

56
00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:41.274
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a good question,
I actually don't know.

57
00:03:41.274 --> 00:03:46.260
The registry is available to like audit,
you can go look at the registry and

58
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.823
where the things come from, you can kinda
audit the supply chain of the code there.

59
00:03:51.823 --> 00:03:56.418
Is the server serving a PC open source
knowing Canonical I would assume, so but

60
00:03:56.418 --> 00:03:59.619
I don't want to say,
because I don't actually know,

61
00:03:59.619 --> 00:04:02.145
whereas like you're correct, like npm.

62
00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:06.673
That's a close source server that npm,
now owned by Github runs.

63
00:04:08.595 --> 00:04:11.937
The Canonical basically
open source has everything.
