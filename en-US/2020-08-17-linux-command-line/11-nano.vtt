1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.084
So, let's get into everyone's
favorite discussion, text editors.

2
00:00:05.084 --> 00:00:08.228
[LAUGH] This is not
a contentious topic at all,

3
00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:12.963
especially from someone that works
on the Visual Studio Code team.

4
00:00:12.963 --> 00:00:17.075
[LAUGH] So someone from the Visual Studio
Code team is going to teach you how to use

5
00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:18.159
other text editors.

6
00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:22.090
So, the next one we're going to
get into is one called nano.

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.247
Now, the reason why I'm going to teach you
these things is I still want you to use

8
00:00:25.247 --> 00:00:26.112
Visual Studio code.

9
00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:29.005
I still think it's objectively
the superior editor, and

10
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:30.430
I will fight people on that.

11
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.019
But there's just a long running joke
that people get stuck in them, right?

12
00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.033
And I don't want that.

13
00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.255
So, I'm going to show
you how to quit them.

14
00:00:39.255 --> 00:00:42.772
That's basically the extent of
what I'm going to show you today.

15
00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:46.415
But I'm also going to show you
how to use nano as a little bit,

16
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:50.989
because it is frequently useful to be
able to edit text in the command line and

17
00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.650
it's good for you to know how
to use the two most common ones.

18
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.561
I guarantee you on any Linux distro,
you always have least nano or

19
00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:03.770
vim available to you,
hopefully both, usually both.

20
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.368
And I just want you to know how
to use them and how to quit them.

21
00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:09.517
That's it.

22
00:01:09.517 --> 00:01:13.306
So, I've never been a command line
editor person, I've always used,

23
00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.682
I started with textmate.

24
00:01:14.682 --> 00:01:18.948
And then I moved to sublime, and
then I used the Visual Studio code.

25
00:01:18.948 --> 00:01:23.813
And I've never even really tried to
use vim as like a professional tool.

26
00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:26.928
I think it's great if you know how
to use it, high fives all around.

27
00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:31.240
You're probably not taking this course
if you're a vim professional, so.

28
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.986
Or maybe you are, I don't know,
I could be surprised.

29
00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:38.378
But man,
I just hate having these discussions,

30
00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:43.016
particularly with people that
think they're superior because of

31
00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:47.832
the text editor that they chose,
which is why I put this XKCD in here.

32
00:01:47.832 --> 00:01:52.201
It's one of my favorite ones about
real people, real programmers

33
00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:57.049
use butterflies to redirect light rays and
that flip bits on hard drives.

34
00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.446
That's the real way of programming.

35
00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:04.106
People don't use cat or Ed or
vim or Emacs or anything like that.

36
00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:07.562
So yeah, that's from XKCD.

37
00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:08.447
I left it linked here.

38
00:02:08.447 --> 00:02:11.195
That's from Randall Munroe,
who's so fantastic.

39
00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:16.829
There's like four more XKCDs in here,
because if you're doing command line,

40
00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:19.615
nano makes a lot of command line jokes.

41
00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:21.257
So, all this to say,
these are all great tools.

42
00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:27.219
If you know how to use them, then the tool
is as good as the master using it, right?

43
00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:31.067
So yeah, that's all I want to say.

44
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:35.548
I want you to not be afraid of these
tools, like I know whenever I got thrown

45
00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:40.417
into vim, like when I was really early
in my career, I would get so frustrated.

46
00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:45.884
There's an article on Stack Overflow about
how they have like a separate server or

47
00:02:45.884 --> 00:02:49.782
a separate specific caching strategy for
how to quit vim.

48
00:02:49.782 --> 00:02:54.688
Because it's like 80% of their traffic,
or something ridiculous like that.

49
00:02:54.688 --> 00:03:00.016
So, yeah, it's a problem.

50
00:03:00.016 --> 00:03:03.892
If you get thrown into vim and don't how
to quit it is the most frustrating thing,

51
00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.687
because control C and
control D both don't work with vim.

52
00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:08.798
But let's talk about nano first.

53
00:03:08.798 --> 00:03:13.479
So, the reason why I talk about nano
is because nano is so small, and

54
00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:15.791
it's on literally everything.

55
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:19.231
So, if you need to edit a text file,
sometimes vim won't be available.

56
00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:22.396
And frequently nano will
be the default one.

57
00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:25.192
So, sometimes you just
get chucked into nano.

58
00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:27.309
And if you don't know how to exit it,
it can be a little odd.

59
00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:31.608
So, nano is a very old open source editor,
and

60
00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:36.363
it's based itself on
another editor called Pico.

61
00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:38.626
And Pico was part of a mail client.

62
00:03:38.626 --> 00:03:43.454
So, people wrote emails using Pico,
but they liked it so

63
00:03:43.454 --> 00:03:49.102
much that they actually broke it out of,
what was the name of that?

64
00:03:49.102 --> 00:03:52.845
Pine, it was called Pine, was the name
of like the suite for editing emails and

65
00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:53.990
a bunch of other stuff.

66
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.158
And they had Pico built into it, but

67
00:03:56.158 --> 00:03:59.716
it wasn't licensed in such
a way that people could use it.

68
00:03:59.716 --> 00:04:01.335
So, they broke it down and
they called it nano.

69
00:04:01.335 --> 00:04:04.792
It was called TIP for a while,
which is called Tip isn't Pico.

70
00:04:04.792 --> 00:04:07.673
This is another thing that
computer scientists just

71
00:04:07.673 --> 00:04:12.386
think that they're hilarious they love to
do which is called the recursive acronym,

72
00:04:12.386 --> 00:04:15.462
which is an acronym that's
defined in terms of itself.

73
00:04:15.462 --> 00:04:19.100
Another one would be PHP,
which is PHP stands for PHP,

74
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.483
hypertext preprocessed, right?

75
00:04:21.483 --> 00:04:26.293
That's what Pico is as well, Tip isn't
Pico, or that's what TIP was, and

76
00:04:26.293 --> 00:04:28.938
then they renamed it eventually to nano.

77
00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:34.903
Computer scientists are silly
in the weirdest ways.

78
00:04:34.903 --> 00:04:40.281
So, it's tiny, it's lightweight,
it's very permissively licensed.

79
00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:47.043
And so, everyone has nano on their
even tiny like embedded devices.

80
00:04:47.043 --> 00:04:51.397
nano is so small it's often even
on those because it is so small.

81
00:04:51.397 --> 00:04:56.564
So, it's good just to know enough about
nano that you're not afraid of it,

82
00:04:56.564 --> 00:04:58.524
you can use it if you need to.

83
00:04:58.524 --> 00:05:00.964
So, let's just go ahead and hop into it.

84
00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:08.519
Open back here, and
I'm in my home directory here.

85
00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:12.988
So, I want you to type nano textfile.txt.

86
00:05:12.988 --> 00:05:18.125
This is gonna pop you into nano,
which again is maintained by

87
00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:23.170
the GNU project,
which is like a lot of these programs are.

88
00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.377
So yeah, nano was written actually
at the University of Washington,

89
00:05:28.377 --> 00:05:31.833
which is cool for
me cuz I'm from Washington.

90
00:05:31.833 --> 00:05:34.983
Yeah, that's where Pine was from,
and they rewrote it so

91
00:05:34.983 --> 00:05:37.440
that they could have a better license for
it.

92
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.315
Because Pine was not licensed in such
a way that the GNU felt comfortable

93
00:05:41.315 --> 00:05:42.875
including in its projects.

94
00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:46.347
So, that's where nano came from.

95
00:05:46.347 --> 00:05:50.205
So, right now I'm just in a text file.

96
00:05:50.205 --> 00:05:51.539
So, this is a text file.

97
00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:54.336
I can write whatever I want.

98
00:05:57.016 --> 00:05:57.975
This is so cool, right?

99
00:05:57.975 --> 00:06:02.649
Normal text editor stuff, and
you can see down here at the bottom,

100
00:06:02.649 --> 00:06:05.250
I have a bunch of different options.

101
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.612
I don't really know very much about nano.

102
00:06:10.612 --> 00:06:13.128
I know enough to write text and
save and quit.

103
00:06:13.128 --> 00:06:15.892
And that's really all
probably you need to know.

104
00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:22.988
I don't know any developers that
use nano for their code editing.

105
00:06:22.988 --> 00:06:26.399
It's really just for
very basic text editing.

106
00:06:26.399 --> 00:06:31.665
But I wanna show you going back to
this character right there down

107
00:06:31.665 --> 00:06:36.833
here at the bottom, that's Control,
so Exit would be Ctrl X,

108
00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:43.193
get help would be Ctrl G, and then write
out is a weird way to say save, right?

109
00:06:43.193 --> 00:06:46.084
So, if I wanted to save this file,
I would hit Ctrl O.

110
00:06:46.084 --> 00:06:49.116
And then it says,
do you want to write to the same file?

111
00:06:49.116 --> 00:06:50.012
I said yes I do.

112
00:06:50.012 --> 00:06:51.136
So, I just hit Enter.

113
00:06:51.136 --> 00:06:53.504
And now I have saved to the file.

114
00:06:53.504 --> 00:06:58.676
And now if I want to exit, I'm just going
to hit Ctrl X, and I am out of nano.

115
00:06:58.676 --> 00:07:02.896
And if I open it again,
everything comes back the way it was.

116
00:07:02.896 --> 00:07:05.520
I think if it's the file is not saved,

117
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.380
if I do this you can see at
the top right it says modified.

118
00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.783
If I hit Ctrl X,
it's going to say, are you sure?

119
00:07:13.783 --> 00:07:15.056
Or is it do you want to save?

120
00:07:15.056 --> 00:07:16.392
Or do you want to just go?

121
00:07:16.392 --> 00:07:22.690
So, if I hit yes, Enter,
I saved it, I exited.

122
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:26.648
And you can see there,
my gibberish is there at the end.

123
00:07:29.747 --> 00:07:32.456
Cool, that's really all I'm
going to show you about nano.

124
00:07:32.456 --> 00:07:33.697
There's more to it.

125
00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:38.638
It's a decent text editor with some
basic features to it, but you're not

126
00:07:38.638 --> 00:07:43.913
going to do anything more than just write
a couple lines and then exit out of it.

127
00:07:46.724 --> 00:07:47.507
Any questions about nano?

128
00:07:51.255 --> 00:07:53.113
Cool, yeah, it's meant to be very simple.

129
00:07:59.193 --> 00:07:59.927
All right.

130
00:07:59.927 --> 00:08:04.687
Yeah, I think the thing to say is like,
if I have to do anything more than what I

131
00:08:04.687 --> 00:08:09.156
just showed you there, is like I will
figure out how to get the file into VS

132
00:08:09.156 --> 00:08:13.810
code and then I'll edit everything in
VS code and put it back into the file.

133
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.931
But if it's just a couple of lines,

134
00:08:15.931 --> 00:08:19.276
I don't mind popping into
nano really quick to do that.
