00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.042
Let's go to everyone's
favorite topic of discussion.

2
00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.211
I've already gotten some furrowed brows

3
00:00:08.211 --> 00:00:13.167
hear that I wasn't going to
teach Vim in my course, for

4
00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:16.962
good reasons,
it's a very polarizing subject, Vim.

5
00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:20.663
So people either love it and
they will tell you everything about it,

6
00:00:20.663 --> 00:00:23.977
or they hate it and they will tell
you how much they hate it and

7
00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:28.066
there's really very few middle
ground positions to hold on them.

8
00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:35.114
Yeah, Dare I says it's the most
polarizing text editor of all time,

9
00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:39.345
I don't think that's even
controversial in and of itself to say.

10
00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:41.620
So Vim has actually a very long and

11
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.558
very interesting history whereas like Nano
came from Pico and like that's really it,

12
00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:53.175
like that's the whole history then came
from like there's like nine upstream

13
00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:58.052
projects from like where have them came
from and it's kind of a windy path.

14
00:01:01.738 --> 00:01:05.928
So it all started with
a project called ed, and

15
00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:10.764
I'm told that it's said ee-dee,
you don't say ed,

16
00:01:10.764 --> 00:01:16.238
that's offensive to people of yore,
[LAUGH] that's called ed,

17
00:01:16.238 --> 00:01:20.696
which in and of itself came from
a different project called qed.

18
00:01:20.696 --> 00:01:25.595
So ed was based on this older project
developed by a guy named Ken Thompson

19
00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:27.372
at Bell Labs in 1969.

20
00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:32.500
Again, a lot of the great ideas that we do
today in computing came from Bell Labs and

21
00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.079
it is a line-oriented programing,

22
00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.566
a line-oriented editor,
which is, for me, nonsensical.

23
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:46.274
I actually spent a decent amount of time
trying to figure out how to use it and

24
00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:50.842
I cannot figure it out but
believe it or not, it's

25
00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:57.105
actually available today.

26
00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:02.501
So if I say ed.txt, so it's based on like

27
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:06.536
you do these like lines like one at a time
and then you can do you type something and

28
00:02:06.536 --> 00:02:10.673
it'll give you back commands with like
question marks and stuff like that.

29
00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:13.984
I don't know if this might as
well be ancient heiroglyphics

30
00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:17.673
to me I'm probably gonna get someone text
me like I use ed for all my editing and

31
00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:20.719
you're a terrible person for
not knowing how to probably, okay?

32
00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.305
I don't even know, yeah, so
Ctrl+D will get you out of it right so

33
00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.560
you can send it a cig quit,
luckily ed will respect that.

34
00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.333
Did I even put anything?

35
00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:36.283
No, I don't think I even saved the file,
so I literally do not know

36
00:02:36.283 --> 00:02:39.376
how to use ed, okay?

37
00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:45.633
So the thing about ed and the why ed
is the way it is it was invented at

38
00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:49.345
a time when memory was very precious and
so

39
00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:53.823
they couldn't keep like
entire text files in memory.

40
00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:58.778
And frequently they were actually even
printing out what was being typed in so

41
00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:01.793
they wanted to do one line at
a time because every bit of like,

42
00:03:01.793 --> 00:03:04.483
screen space basically was precious,
right?

43
00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:09.159
So that's why line editors are oriented
towards lines is because they didn't want

44
00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.446
to be able to or they didn't want to have
to print everything out all at once.

45
00:03:13.446 --> 00:03:18.052
Suffice to say that, that idea has cleanly
gone away there's no one that uses any

46
00:03:18.052 --> 00:03:22.147
sort of line editor style anymore
because memory isn't such and

47
00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:25.698
screen-space is not a resource
that we care about anymore.

48
00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:33.205
So this is back in a time when ed was used
in a time when bits what you talked about

49
00:03:33.205 --> 00:03:36.152
not kilobytes, not megabytes,
not gigabytes,

50
00:03:36.152 --> 00:03:38.578
it was bits you were worried
about individual bits.

51
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.331
Okay, so from ed we got ex,

52
00:03:45.331 --> 00:03:50.062
I think people say that ex and
might be E-X, I'm not really sure.

53
00:03:50.062 --> 00:03:53.496
Ex was a line editor but
not nonsensical, right?

54
00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:57.412
It was actually much easier to use
people like that, that got popular for

55
00:03:57.412 --> 00:03:58.459
a long time.

56
00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.298
It put on much nicer face on ed and

57
00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:05.050
that's what people use for
a while and is well known.

58
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:12.454
I actually think if I go in here and
I say, ex textfile.txt.

59
00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:17.288
It actually does, so ex is still around,
you can see I'm entering ex mode,

60
00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:19.811
but if I type :visual.

61
00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:28.922
It actually pops me now into them,
so ex is actually now using them,

62
00:04:28.922 --> 00:04:33.673
so ex evolved into Vim and
it's actually now just a mode in Vim.

63
00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:43.360
But it actually started with
the inverse where VI was a mode for ex,

64
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.232
it was the visual mode for the ex editor.

65
00:04:51.501 --> 00:04:58.481
So from ex,
ex was evolved itself from a two previous

66
00:04:58.481 --> 00:05:04.475
iterations called en and
and then we got ex.

67
00:05:04.475 --> 00:05:09.784
And then eventually a guy
named I think Bill Joy

68
00:05:10.934 --> 00:05:16.511
made a screen-oriented version of ex
called vi, which was visual mode for

69
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:21.189
ex, so it actually still used vi or
ex under the hood, it was just like a more

70
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:26.274
visual oriented representation but
vi was just a mode in ex.

71
00:05:29.245 --> 00:05:34.266
So from there vi kinda became
the default that people

72
00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:39.113
just started using vi to open ex and
directly in visual mode.

73
00:05:39.113 --> 00:05:43.197
A guy named Tim Thompson
made a vi clone for

74
00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:50.213
the Atari ST that then this guy named
Bram Moolenaar ported to the Amiga.

75
00:05:50.213 --> 00:05:56.736
He made this Vi IMitation so V-I-M,
Vim, which was then later renamed

76
00:05:56.736 --> 00:06:02.108
to Vi IMproved instead of Vi IMitate or
Vi IMitation and

77
00:06:02.108 --> 00:06:06.555
it was just a bunch of quality of
life improvements on the original V.

78
00:06:06.555 --> 00:06:11.296
So again if you're on Vi on Mac,
it's just running Vim,

79
00:06:11.296 --> 00:06:15.292
so I frequently type vi textfile.txt, but

80
00:06:15.292 --> 00:06:20.339
it's actually running vim, and
those are separate things but these days

81
00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.608
it doesn't really matter because people
don't use vi anymore they just use them.

82
00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:28.538
So that's probably like maybe about ten
minutes extra of history that you didn't

83
00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:31.998
really need but I found it very
interesting and I wanted to share so

84
00:06:31.998 --> 00:06:34.992
of how we got from like,
these crazy line editors to this like

85
00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:39.596
modern tool that people still use,
like they're actually rewriting Vim now to

86
00:06:39.596 --> 00:06:44.435
a new program called Neo Vim right and
so it's still very alive, very healthy.

87
00:06:44.435 --> 00:06:48.937
People love it i a lot of the frontend
masters, instructors themselves use them

88
00:06:48.937 --> 00:06:55.452
so it is full featured it works with like
React and JSX and all the latest stuff.
