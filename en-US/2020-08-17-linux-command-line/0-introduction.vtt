00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
My name is Brian Holt, and
I am really excited to be back at

2
00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:09.445
Frontend Masters teaching
the Complete Intro to Linux and the CLI.

3
00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:14.876
So the first thing is I want everyone to
get on this particular page right now.

4
00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:20.336
You can see I have the URL up here but
I also give you a nice little bit.ly link,

5
00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:22.774
bit.ly/Linux-cli like that.

6
00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:30.152
And if you go to that, Linux-cli,
it should just take you straight to that.

7
00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:33.285
You can also just get it off of my GitHub,
too.

8
00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:37.684
Cool, so you should land on this page and
just to get you a little

9
00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:42.500
acquainted with how this particular
website works for this course.

10
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.125
You can see here I have all these
various different sections and chapters.

11
00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:49.313
So if I click here on
Welcome Introduction,

12
00:00:49.313 --> 00:00:54.147
you'll see up here that it says
welcome-introduction, right?

13
00:00:54.147 --> 00:00:59.046
So that means if you get lost,
you can just look and say, okay,

14
00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:03.312
he's in the linux-what-is-linux thing,
right?

15
00:01:03.312 --> 00:01:04.052
Cool.

16
00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:09.149
So with that, let's go ahead and

17
00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:15.010
hop into the introduction,
let's hop right into it.

18
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.921
This is the Complete Intro to Linux and
the Command Line.

19
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:20.983
So this is kind of like
a bit of a passion thing for

20
00:01:20.983 --> 00:01:25.517
me that I think developers really
need to learn how to use their tools.

21
00:01:25.517 --> 00:01:28.882
And I think a lot of people
underinvest with their knowledge and

22
00:01:28.882 --> 00:01:30.415
how to use the command line.

23
00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:33.998
It's the point like I've worked with
plenty of people that never use

24
00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:36.714
the command line,
they always use some sort of GUI or

25
00:01:36.714 --> 00:01:40.141
program to handle things like Git and
and other things like that.

26
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.176
I think it's a mistake because I think
this tool can be very useful to you.

27
00:01:44.176 --> 00:01:48.558
So you can see we have a nice
picture of a Gentoo penguin here.

28
00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:52.127
We had an artist come in and
do some of these things for

29
00:01:52.127 --> 00:01:55.860
us that ended up great,
her name is Alice Brereton, so

30
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.346
if you wanna check out her art,
I left you a little link down here.

31
00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:04.296
But yeah, it took me actually several
years of working with code and

32
00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:08.247
being a programmer before I actually
invested the time to go back and

33
00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:11.740
learn Bash, and learn Linux,
and learn the command line.

34
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.740
And so that's kinda what I'm hoping
here for you is that I can kind

35
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.888
of help you shortcut this kind of
years of hodgepodge learning, and

36
00:02:19.888 --> 00:02:22.244
you can kind of learn a lot all at once.

37
00:02:23.817 --> 00:02:27.821
So who are you?

38
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:30.365
What kind of person is this class for?

39
00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:33.576
This class is for anyone's ever
wanted to learn the command line for

40
00:02:33.576 --> 00:02:35.280
really for any reason whatsoever.

41
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.194
Whether that's for programming purposes,
or machine learning, or

42
00:02:39.194 --> 00:02:43.453
anything like that, all that will be
taught here in this particular class.

43
00:02:43.453 --> 00:02:48.355
You can be all the way from learning your
first programming language to being a pro

44
00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:50.025
in the industry for years.

45
00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:53.922
Four or five years into my career,
I wish this had already existed.

46
00:02:55.713 --> 00:03:00.759
So I'll say that a tiny bit of
programming experience is useful,

47
00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.698
but it's not required.

48
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.931
Incidental to learning
the command line here,

49
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.030
you're gonna be learning
quite a bit of Linux.

50
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.994
And that's just the name of the course,
Complete Intro to Linux and

51
00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:14.827
the Command Line.

52
00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:18.367
The course is probably primarily oriented
to teaching you the command line and

53
00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:20.792
we're gonna be learning a bit
of Linux along the way.

54
00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:24.909
We'll be learning specifically Ububtu.

55
00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.979
Ubuntu is one flavor of Linux.

56
00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:29.155
There's a bunch of them,
we'll talk about that later.

57
00:03:29.155 --> 00:03:33.259
But suffice to say, it's at least
one of the more popular ones,

58
00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:36.303
if not the most popular
distribution of Linux.

59
00:03:36.303 --> 00:03:40.833
I'll just throw out here as well,
much of what I'm teaching here is portable

60
00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:43.627
to other things other than just Linux,
right?

61
00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:48.951
So I'm teaching you Bash and Ubuntu,
but I would say almost everything

62
00:03:48.951 --> 00:03:53.933
I'm gonna teach you works directly
in macOS just without change.

63
00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:57.402
And zsh, which is a very similar
shell to Bash, which again,

64
00:03:57.402 --> 00:03:59.424
we'll talk about that in a second.

65
00:03:59.424 --> 00:04:04.065
And even much of this will translate
to PowerShell and Windows, much less,

66
00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:08.574
though, I would say that's less than
50% but it's still quite a bit.

67
00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:11.294
Okay?

68
00:04:11.294 --> 00:04:16.234
So where can you expect to be
after you take this course?

69
00:04:16.234 --> 00:04:19.585
I would say if you're uncomfortable with
the command line, I think after this

70
00:04:19.585 --> 00:04:22.857
course you will be feel comfortable
enough to work a lot in the command line.

71
00:04:22.857 --> 00:04:26.125
And if you're already comfortable
with the command line,

72
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:29.521
I would say that you are gonna
learn a bunch of tips and tricks,

73
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.923
and probably learn a bunch of the reasons
of why you do things the way you do them.

74
00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:39.030
Cool, contributing, so if you find
a spelling error or anything like that,

75
00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.212
go ahead and file an issue or
open a pull request on this course.

76
00:04:43.212 --> 00:04:47.993
It's open source and it's just on GitHub,
feel free to share this as well.

77
00:04:47.993 --> 00:04:50.539
I'm really grateful to
Frontend Masters for

78
00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.828
letting me teach this in such a way that
we can open source all the materials.

79
00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:57.776
And then something new that we're
gonna do for this course here,

80
00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:58.964
I put this Errata in here.

81
00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:04.561
So if you click here, at the end,
there is a page of errata.

82
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:07.441
So if I mess up something during
the filming of this course,

83
00:05:07.441 --> 00:05:11.471
obviously we can't go back and refilm it,
so what I'll do is I'll put a note here in

84
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:14.202
the Errata of something
that's wrong with the course.

85
00:05:14.202 --> 00:05:18.746
So if you're watching this on demand
later, just go check to see if

86
00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:23.302
there's anything in here of what
we might have done incorrectly.

87
00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:28.574
Okay, who am I?

88
00:05:28.574 --> 00:05:32.544
My name is Brian, I'm an Aquarius,
no, I'm just kidding.

89
00:05:32.544 --> 00:05:36.380
That is true, but
I'm not gonna talk about that.

90
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.533
As of right now, I work at Microsoft,
I'm a senior program manager.

91
00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:48.035
I work on JavaScript, on Azure,
as well as on Visual Studio Code.

92
00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:52.894
I've worked quite a bit in developer
tooling and developer productivity, and

93
00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:57.173
so it's kind of a passion of mine to
help developers use their tools and

94
00:05:57.173 --> 00:06:00.745
then help tools be something
that developers want to use.

95
00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:06.365
So hopefully this helps you kind
of in both of those respects.

96
00:06:06.365 --> 00:06:09.617
I've also done developer relations for
Microsoft, and

97
00:06:09.617 --> 00:06:13.820
I've been a JavaScript/NodeJS
engineer/infrastructure engineer at

98
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.426
LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit,
a couple other places as well.

99
00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:19.252
As far as Frontend Masters,

100
00:06:19.252 --> 00:06:24.270
I think I've definitely been here
close to 10, 15 times, I can't even,

101
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.160
no, I'm not gonna try and count,
it's a lot, we'll just say it's a lot.

102
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.016
Yeah, so I think a lot about code
developer tools and making devs happy.

103
00:06:33.016 --> 00:06:34.747
When I'm not working,

104
00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:39.517
you can find me being just terrible
at Overwatch, that's true.

105
00:06:39.517 --> 00:06:41.693
There's people that would attest to that.

106
00:06:41.693 --> 00:06:47.339
Traveling the world, when one can travel,
and sampling the finest, peatiest

107
00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:52.827
whiskeys and hobbyist beers, sweating
on a Peloton, that's true as well.

108
00:06:52.827 --> 00:06:56.963
Or hanging out with my wife and
my sassy little dog, whose name is Luna.

109
00:06:56.963 --> 00:07:00.304
I'm sure I'll mention her cuz I have
a habit of mentioning her in my course.

110
00:07:00.304 --> 00:07:03.928
I live in Seattle, and yeah.

111
00:07:03.928 --> 00:07:05.926
And while I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead and

112
00:07:05.926 --> 00:07:09.016
shout out my three favorite charities
that you might take a look at.

113
00:07:09.016 --> 00:07:12.542
Which are AnnieCannons, The Last Mile,
and VetsWhoCode, which is great.

114
00:07:12.542 --> 00:07:17.534
They get to work with Frontend Masters
cuz they support those charities as well.

115
00:07:17.534 --> 00:07:20.310
And again,
special thanks to Frontend Masters,

116
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.299
these people really are my family.

117
00:07:22.299 --> 00:07:24.923
No one looked at me and
give me puppy dog eyes.

118
00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:29.310
But it's been really great to work with
these wonderful people over the year,

119
00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:30.783
the years, I should say.

120
00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:34.003
And because of them,
I get to open source my courses and

121
00:07:34.003 --> 00:07:38.287
reach a lot of people, so all sorts of
feel goods and hugs are all around.
