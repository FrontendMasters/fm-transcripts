00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
First of all congratulations for
sitting through so

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.643
much of a bash course like that,
and of itself deserves a medal.

3
00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:10.222
It's not the most exciting topic,
Bash has been around forever.

4
00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:13.198
It's kind of a tool that everyone
just kind of assumes you know.

5
00:00:13.198 --> 00:00:16.305
And so, like if you go into an interview,
they're not gonna ask you a bunch of bash

6
00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:18.886
questions, because one,
they probably don't know themselves.

7
00:00:18.886 --> 00:00:23.920
And two, it's just not the most
exciting shiny technology.

8
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.096
But I just had this personal strong
opinion that, when you have these

9
00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:30.108
tools that you're interacting
with on a very consistent basis,

10
00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:32.374
as a developer often will
do with a command line.

11
00:00:32.374 --> 00:00:35.199
It's worth the time to
invest in these tools and

12
00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.036
figure out how to be more
productive with them.

13
00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:41.139
Because if you can learn how
to be two seconds faster, but

14
00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:45.014
you learn that very early in your career,
you can say the hours over your

15
00:00:45.014 --> 00:00:48.782
entire career just by kind of learning and
investing in these tools.

16
00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:50.532
And honestly,
I think it's kind of fun, right?

17
00:00:50.532 --> 00:00:52.538
It's kind of fun to automate these tasks.

18
00:00:52.538 --> 00:00:55.398
It was such a pain in the ass before, but

19
00:00:55.398 --> 00:00:59.313
now you can do really
cool things with them.

20
00:00:59.313 --> 00:01:02.858
So, everything that I taught you
was within the context of bash and

21
00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:03.627
your boon to.

22
00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:09.163
But I just wanted to really hit
home that if I go back over to Mac,

23
00:01:09.163 --> 00:01:11.779
now I'm in Mac land, right?

24
00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:19.207
All these things,
I just did crontab, right?

25
00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:22.166
All this stuff still applies to Mac OS,
almost all of it.

26
00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:26.310
Like verbatim, you could copy and
paste from my course into Mac and

27
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.860
it would still work, because I'm using zsh
here, zsh and bash are largest compatible.

28
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.418
And really smart people made
Mac OS relatively compatible with

29
00:01:36.418 --> 00:01:38.403
the same way that Linux is.

30
00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:43.176
So everything that I just taught you
will work very, very well with Mac,

31
00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:48.043
if not, I can't even think of anything
that wouldn't work the same way.

32
00:01:48.043 --> 00:01:50.158
So, that's one thing to keep in mind.

33
00:01:50.158 --> 00:01:54.003
As well as PowerShell,
a lot of this will works with PowerShell.

34
00:01:54.003 --> 00:01:58.888
Certainly all of the paradigms I showed
you with PowerShell work exactly the same,

35
00:01:58.888 --> 00:02:02.883
it's just like the specific syntax
will be a little bit different.

36
00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:04.501
And I'll be honest with you,

37
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.535
PowerShell is a lot more pleasant to
work with because it's more modern.

38
00:02:08.535 --> 00:02:15.102
Microsoft invest a lot into making
it a much more modern experience.

39
00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:18.964
For example, you get syntax highlighting
as you're typing, which is really cool,

40
00:02:18.964 --> 00:02:20.422
which you don't get with bash.

41
00:02:20.422 --> 00:02:21.329
But things like,

42
00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.785
I think fish does actually give you
syntax highlighting on the fly.

43
00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:28.700
But anyway, all that to say, you are now
much more apt to hop into PowerShell and

44
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.703
feel okay about it.

45
00:02:33.677 --> 00:02:35.433
Cool, and then I just wanted to give
you some places to go from here.

46
00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:39.880
We talked a lot about the command line.

47
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.346
And right now I feel pretty
confident saying that you

48
00:02:43.346 --> 00:02:48.168
are certainly intermediate developers
at the very least now with bash.

49
00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:52.427
Just based on all the information that I
have, you're lucky that the bar here is

50
00:02:52.427 --> 00:02:56.192
pretty low, because most people
don't know how to use it super well.

51
00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:58.609
So, where do we go from here?

52
00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.008
There's definitely more depth
to be gained here on bash.

53
00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:04.067
This was definitely a cursory
introduction and I missed a lot of,

54
00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:07.138
some important concepts,
like we didn't talk about symlinks.

55
00:03:07.138 --> 00:03:12.089
You might go look up the symlinks, because
that is actually a fairly important

56
00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:16.453
concept, one that I don't use a ton
because it's a pain in the butt.

57
00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:18.892
So today you can go get
more depth on bash.

58
00:03:18.892 --> 00:03:21.906
There's my course on the complete
intro to containers,

59
00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:26.111
which takes this knowledge that I gave
you, and takes it into even further depth

60
00:03:26.111 --> 00:03:29.661
that teaches you more about docker and
how to do Linux containers.

61
00:03:29.661 --> 00:03:33.781
It was actually the inspiration for doing
this course, because I wanted to make sure

62
00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:36.856
everyone got up to the level that
they needed to have on bash, so

63
00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:38.963
they felt comfortable doing containers.

64
00:03:38.963 --> 00:03:43.393
So that is definitely the intermediate
version of this course

65
00:03:43.393 --> 00:03:45.872
would be the intro to containers.

66
00:03:45.872 --> 00:03:47.576
Get in depth from Nunez agribank.

67
00:03:47.576 --> 00:03:52.182
I think I've referenced that a couple of
times that'll teach you get specifically

68
00:03:52.182 --> 00:03:56.612
which is very command line oriented,
full stack front, front end engineers.

69
00:03:56.612 --> 00:04:00.147
I think that has a little bit of
a crossover with this course as well

70
00:04:00.147 --> 00:04:03.377
from my old coworker at Netflix,
Jim, but it's amazing.

71
00:04:03.377 --> 00:04:07.995
And then I wanna encourage all of
you to dig into node.js because it's

72
00:04:07.995 --> 00:04:09.883
a very huge passion of mine.

73
00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:13.994
And I would be upset if literally anyone
else taught that course in Frontend of

74
00:04:13.994 --> 00:04:17.409
masters except Scott Moss,
because he's one, just the best,

75
00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.907
most entertaining teacher, and
just the nicest guy in general.

76
00:04:20.907 --> 00:04:24.450
So definitely go check out
the introduction to node from Scott.

77
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.961
So thanks again, thanks for
sticking through it.

78
00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:31.848
I'm super appreciative, I know for
a Masters is appreciative all the people

79
00:04:31.848 --> 00:04:35.318
that watch the courses and
all the subscribers as I am.

80
00:04:35.318 --> 00:04:37.963
So take this knowledge, go out and make
the world a little bit better place, and

81
00:04:37.963 --> 00:04:39.202
hopefully it makes it a bit happier.

82
00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:42.494
So thank you and thanks for

83
00:04:42.494 --> 00:04:47.284
sticking through the course with me.

84
00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:48.439
