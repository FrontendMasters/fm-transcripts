1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.324
This has been a lot of talking.

2
00:00:01.324 --> 00:00:06.322
I mean, we're a decent amount into this
course we have not done anything yet,

3
00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:07.923
so let's do something.

4
00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:12.783
So I have to kinda give you disparate
instructions depending on what your

5
00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:14.304
operating system is.

6
00:00:14.304 --> 00:00:16.301
You can see here I have my Mac running.

7
00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:20.510
So I'll be showing you obviously
all this stuff from a Mac, but

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.050
this should also work for Windows and
this will also work for Linux.

9
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.235
So I'll just say, if you're already
running a Linux computer, congratulations,

10
00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:29.309
you're already finished.

11
00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:31.073
You can use Linux on Linux, right?

12
00:00:31.073 --> 00:00:35.352
I don't think that's much
of a secret to anybody.

13
00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:38.029
But if you're on macOS or
if you're on Windows,

14
00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:40.655
you're gonna have to do
some extra steps here.

15
00:00:40.655 --> 00:00:43.756
So we're gonna go through
something called virtualization.

16
00:00:43.756 --> 00:00:47.436
You've probably heard
the abbreviation of VM before, so

17
00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:50.446
we're gonna set up
a Linux VM on your computer.

18
00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:55.136
And a VM is just an operating system
running within another operating system.

19
00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:57.955
So you basically have a host machine,
which will be my Mac, right?

20
00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:00.744
And it's basically going to create
a virtual computer inside of it that

21
00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:02.195
I'm going to access through my Mac.

22
00:01:02.195 --> 00:01:04.259
That process is called virtualization.

23
00:01:06.588 --> 00:01:09.114
And that VM must can have access
to any like real hardware.

24
00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:14.307
Basically, your host computer is
going to fake access to memory,

25
00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:19.501
access to all that kinda stuff,
and it's going to give that access

26
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:24.158
to the guest machine,
the VM that's running inside of it.

27
00:01:24.158 --> 00:01:26.576
So at this point,
we're gonna get your VM up and running.

28
00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:27.825
So I'm gonna give you a couple options.

29
00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:32.525
The one that I'm gonna suggest
to you is one called Multipass.

30
00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:37.603
So if you go to multipass.run, like that,

31
00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:41.324
you'll end up on this website.

32
00:01:41.324 --> 00:01:42.527
This is from Canonical.

33
00:01:42.527 --> 00:01:47.552
You can see up here, this is actually
an official project from Canonical,

34
00:01:47.552 --> 00:01:51.558
and it's just a mini VM runner for
Ubuntu on your computer.

35
00:01:51.558 --> 00:01:53.588
It's super easy to get up and
running with.

36
00:01:55.762 --> 00:02:02.946
So if you go back to my page here,
not that one, this one.

37
00:02:02.946 --> 00:02:08.335
So I gave you instructions here for
Windows 10, and instructions for macOS.

38
00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:12.781
So just go ahead and click on this, and go
through this, and I'm gonna leave that so

39
00:02:12.781 --> 00:02:17.051
that you follow their instructions,
cuz they'll keep this up to date for you.

40
00:02:17.051 --> 00:02:21.970
But for Mac, it's really as easy, it's
just downloading something off of GitHub,

41
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.131
installing it, and

42
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:27.736
then you'll get this little orange thing
that you can see up here in my toolbar.

43
00:02:27.736 --> 00:02:33.029
That's what Multipass is, and it's
relatively the same process for, oops,

44
00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:38.013
let's go back here, it's relatively
the same process for Windows 10.

45
00:02:38.013 --> 00:02:43.388
The one thing that I want to call out,
if you are on Windows 10 Home,

46
00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:46.552
you have to install VirtualBox, okay?

47
00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:49.974
If you're on Windows 10 Professional or
Education or Enterprise,

48
00:02:49.974 --> 00:02:53.802
you don't need to do anything else,
you just need to install Windows 10, so

49
00:02:53.802 --> 00:02:56.650
you need to just install Multipass and
you're good to go.

50
00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.154
But if you're on Windows 10 Home,
you have to install one more tool,

51
00:03:02.154 --> 00:03:06.671
which will be VirtualBox,
which I have down here as well.

52
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.191
So I'm just gonna reemphasize that cuz
I know people are gonna ask me later,

53
00:03:10.191 --> 00:03:13.163
if you have Windows 10 Home,
be sure you install VirtualBox.

54
00:03:17.028 --> 00:03:22.009
Okay, so once you go through that,
it'll give you this little thing up here,

55
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:23.752
and you can open the shell.

56
00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:26.759
So if I just click Open Shell here,

57
00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:31.018
you can see immediately
it drops me into Ubuntu.

58
00:03:31.018 --> 00:03:35.707
And for macOS, you just install it and
it should work.

59
00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:38.116
So the other option I do wanna give you,

60
00:03:38.116 --> 00:03:42.716
you can just use VirtualBox directly
whether you're on Mac OS or Windows or

61
00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:45.651
Linux, VirtualBox works
on all three of them.

62
00:03:45.651 --> 00:03:51.408
It's a project from Oracle that allows
you to run VMs whenever you want.

63
00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:54.752
It's just a little bit more
process to get that up and

64
00:03:54.752 --> 00:03:58.559
running because you have to
install the installer as well.

65
00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:01.170
So I'm going to suggest
everyone use Multipass.

66
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:09.361
So, and I did leave some instructions
here if you want to go through and

67
00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:13.680
do VirtualBox, I'm not gonna again walk
through them, but at the end of it,

68
00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.292
if you do VirtualBox,
it will look like this.

69
00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:25.630
And then lastly for just Windows 10 users,

70
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.113
you can do WSL, and
I left some instructions there.

71
00:04:30.113 --> 00:04:33.595
WSL allows you to run a Linux
kernel within Windows,

72
00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:36.142
I'm not gonna get too much into that.

73
00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:40.053
If you wanna go down that pathway, that's
actually what I do on my personal laptop,

74
00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.548
is used WSL, but
that's not available to everyone.

75
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.934
So does anyone have any questions or

76
00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:55.134
concerns about installing Multipass?

77
00:04:55.134 --> 00:04:56.884
That's really what I think you should do,

78
00:04:56.884 --> 00:04:59.666
unless you have a strong opinion
that you should do something else.

79
00:04:59.666 --> 00:05:02.812
&gt;&gt; Can you use Windows Subsystem for
Linux?

80
00:05:02.812 --> 00:05:07.243
&gt;&gt; Yep, actually, that was the last
thing I was talking about here for

81
00:05:07.243 --> 00:05:08.739
WSL users right here.

82
00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:12.160
So Windows Subsystem for Linux is WSL and

83
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.195
I left the doc here for
getting it up and running on Windows.

84
00:05:17.195 --> 00:05:24.175
I would definitely suggest
getting WSL2 if you wanna on WSL.

85
00:05:24.175 --> 00:05:27.530
As of Windows Update 2004,

86
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.500
which most Windows
computers should be on now,

87
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.475
you can get WSL2 whether you have Home or
Pro versions of Windows.

88
00:05:39.475 --> 00:05:44.543
If you're on older, like 1906,
you have to be on WSL1,

89
00:05:44.543 --> 00:05:49.325
or sorry, [COUGH] excuse me,
yeah, only WSL1 will work.

90
00:05:49.325 --> 00:05:54.370
So anyway, yes,
WSL will work great for this course.

91
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.714
&gt;&gt; Is virtualization and
emulation, is that the same?

92
00:06:01.268 --> 00:06:05.328
&gt;&gt; You know, I don't actually really know
the difference between those two things.

93
00:06:05.328 --> 00:06:09.839
I think emulation is you're
emulating specific hardware,

94
00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:15.411
like when I hear emulators, I think
of emulating video game ROMs, right,

95
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:21.179
where you have your computer pretending
to be different hardware than it is.

96
00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:25.799
Whereas I think virtualization is actually
just creating subsets of resources and

97
00:06:25.799 --> 00:06:28.638
giving a guest machine
access to those resources.

98
00:06:28.638 --> 00:06:32.900
So it's not like you're really
emulating anything of sorts.

99
00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.990
In fact, you're not, right?

100
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.535
Everything is still the same instruction
set, whereas emulation, you're actually

101
00:06:38.535 --> 00:06:42.405
changing instructions on the fly to
try and pretend to be something else.

102
00:06:42.405 --> 00:06:44.451
But you might wanna check me on that,

103
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:47.165
that's just me pulling
stuff out of somewhere.

104
00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:51.536
&gt;&gt; Do you know the main difference
between WSL 1.0 and WSL 2.0?

105
00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:55.386
&gt;&gt; I do, WSL2 is actually virtualized.

106
00:06:55.386 --> 00:07:01.244
So it's a it's a real VM,
it runs on Microsoft Hyper-V,

107
00:07:01.244 --> 00:07:06.387
whereas WSL1 was doing
a translation basically,

108
00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:10.708
it was more like an emulation, I suppose.

109
00:07:10.708 --> 00:07:15.741
So it was a lot slower,
in particular when it had to do cross,

110
00:07:15.741 --> 00:07:19.988
when talking from Windows to Linux and
Linux back,

111
00:07:19.988 --> 00:07:25.250
it was super, super slow,
whereas Hypervisor is quite fast.

112
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.966
So suffice to say, they basically read
totally redid WSL from the ground

113
00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:33.923
up from WSL1 to WSL2, and
it's just 100 times faster.

114
00:07:33.923 --> 00:07:35.096
I don't think I'm even exaggerating.

115
00:07:35.096 --> 00:07:40.519
I think it's actually
over 100 times faster.

116
00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:45.276
The virtual file system in WSL1 was so
slow that when you did NPM installs inside

117
00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:49.607
of WSL, it would take minutes just
because of the file IO between back and

118
00:07:49.607 --> 00:07:51.108
forth of writing files.

119
00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:59.604
And now NPM install on WSL can sometimes
be faster than natively running Linux.

120
00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:04.435
&gt;&gt; And there's quite a few people asking
about if they can just continue on

121
00:08:04.435 --> 00:08:08.312
with bash if they have Mac
rather than virtualizing Linux

122
00:08:08.312 --> 00:08:10.068
&gt;&gt; Wouldn't suggest it.

123
00:08:10.068 --> 00:08:14.355
You're certainly gonna run
into some differences,

124
00:08:14.355 --> 00:08:18.555
because they are, like I said,
different things.

125
00:08:18.555 --> 00:08:23.187
So I would suggest getting into
Multipass and running Linux.

126
00:08:23.187 --> 00:08:26.973
You don't have to, I mean,
it will mostly work, but

127
00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:32.371
part of the point of this course is also
to learn a little bit of Linux as well.
