00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.911
The next thing that we're going to get
into is a section on the power of control.

2
00:00:06.911 --> 00:00:09.838
Or the Ctr L key.

3
00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:14.904
So Signals and
the Power of CTR is where we are.

4
00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:18.610
So the Ctrl key, which is like the yeah,

5
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.188
it's one of the keys on
your keyboard right CTRL or

6
00:00:23.188 --> 00:00:27.671
control is used quite
a bit within the terminal.

7
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:31.465
It's actually used so much and
I never use my Caps Lock key that I've

8
00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:34.261
actually remapped my
Caps Lock key to be control,

9
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.745
because then I don't have to reach all
the way to the bottom left of my keyboard.

10
00:00:38.745 --> 00:00:41.556
That's like an extra like quarter
calorie that I don't have to spend.

11
00:00:41.556 --> 00:00:46.500
So I remapped my caps lock to that and
I also accidentally hit caps

12
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.183
lock all the time, so
I actually have a little tip at the end.

13
00:00:51.183 --> 00:00:52.475
If you want to see how to do that.

14
00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:55.660
I'll show you how to do that
at the very end of the course.

15
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.579
No I actually have it right here.

16
00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.634
I have it on there twice.

17
00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:03.087
Okay, so for Mac,
I have the tip there and Windows there,

18
00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:05.605
you can just click on that and
it'll show you how to do that.

19
00:01:05.605 --> 00:01:08.738
So I'm gonna show you a few of them.

20
00:01:08.738 --> 00:01:13.021
Some of these are more
important than the other.

21
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:17.825
But let's go ahead and
get started with some of these.

22
00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:22.950
So one of them if I start typing and
I wanna go to the very beginning, I can

23
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.687
hit Control A and that'll actually take
my cursor all the way to the beginning.

24
00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.027
And I can start going from there.

25
00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:34.290
And by the same token, if I hit Control E,
that'll take me all the way to the end.

26
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.878
I'm sure you could use like home and
end keys if you have those,

27
00:01:38.878 --> 00:01:41.489
I don't have those on my keyboard.

28
00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:44.550
So but if you had those,
you could definitely use those as well.

29
00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.987
But Ctrl+A and Ctrl+E will do
that within the command line.

30
00:01:49.987 --> 00:01:56.497
There's another one here called
which I use it mostly as a delete,

31
00:01:56.497 --> 00:02:00.912
so if I hit control K,
it's actually going to

32
00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:05.462
delete everything after the cursor, right?

33
00:02:05.462 --> 00:02:07.958
It's actually doing something called yank,

34
00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.585
which people don't really
use as much anymore.

35
00:02:10.585 --> 00:02:15.234
But before there was really a clipboard
and copy and paste, there was yank.

36
00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:17.754
So I can actually can hit Ctrl y, and

37
00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:22.038
that's actually going to paste
back everything I yanked and

38
00:02:22.038 --> 00:02:26.662
it's not copy and paste because
it does not go to your clipboard.

39
00:02:26.662 --> 00:02:28.010
It's a separate buffer
called the yank buffer.

40
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.161
I don't know if it's called the yank
buffer, but that's what I call it.

41
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:34.854
So Ctrl k will yank everything before and
Ctrl u,

42
00:02:34.854 --> 00:02:38.754
I believe what yank everything before.

43
00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:42.831
And again Ctrl y is the paste for
that yank buffer.

44
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:46.676
Now you might ask like,
when would I actually use that?

45
00:02:46.676 --> 00:02:50.176
I only really use it to delete right?

46
00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:53.179
Like I'm sure some of you have
used cut to delete things right?

47
00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.140
It's kind of the same idea
of why I use yank here.

48
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.939
There's more granular ways
of doing doing yank as well.

49
00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.090
You can like yank words,
you can do characters at a time.

50
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.444
But I really only use K and
U to delete everything to the end or

51
00:03:07.444 --> 00:03:09.198
everything to the beginning.

52
00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:15.159
We talked about before, but
if you hit Ctrl L that clears the screen.

53
00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:19.105
And then CTRL R is what does
the reverse search, right?

54
00:03:19.105 --> 00:03:22.767
There's more than what I just
showed you right there, but

55
00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.681
I just showed you all
the ones that I personally

56
00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:29.882
use on some cadence that I actually
use enough to remember, okay?

57
00:03:29.882 --> 00:03:31.582
So those are just shortcuts.

58
00:03:31.582 --> 00:03:33.813
They're not doing really anything special.

59
00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:36.193
They're just simple shortcuts for
you to get going.

60
00:03:36.193 --> 00:03:39.737
And the reason why I like yank
in particular as useful is like,

61
00:03:39.737 --> 00:03:43.228
I can't actually like,
highlight all this and hit delete.

62
00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:47.131
The highlight delete doesn't work because
it doesn't track your mouse position

63
00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:48.212
within the terminal.

64
00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:55.588
So that's why I actually bothered to learn
Ctrl U to delete everything on the line.
