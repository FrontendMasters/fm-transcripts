00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.794
The next thing I wanted to tell you is,
/bin/echo.

2
00:00:12.627 --> 00:00:14.616
Okay.

3
00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:18.222
So, a peculiarity of echo and

4
00:00:18.222 --> 00:00:24.310
particularly with Bash,
if I say echo -e hi.

5
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.065
It is doing it correctly, nevermind.

6
00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:30.524
But if I do echo help, is that working?

7
00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:33.384
Yeah, so it actually echoes out help,
right, which is not what you expect,

8
00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:34.710
you actually want it to be the flag.

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.236
But it is smart enough to respect the -e,
which is kind of interesting.

10
00:00:38.236 --> 00:00:43.211
So, you can have echo echo out

11
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:47.788
colors so if I say echo -e,

12
00:00:47.788 --> 00:00:52.763
this is how you make colour and

13
00:00:52.763 --> 00:01:00.925
then the way you do green is \e[32mgreen].

14
00:01:04.235 --> 00:01:05.220
Like that.

15
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.522
There you go.

16
00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:11.996
So this little bit right here, it's some
escaped character that Bash understands,

17
00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:16.862
this represents that everything after
this is gonna end up being green, and

18
00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:18.701
there's a bunch of colors.

19
00:01:18.701 --> 00:01:21.016
And you might ask,
why would I use this directly?

20
00:01:21.016 --> 00:01:24.750
And typically you don't, but I wanted to
let you know that you can set colors for

21
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.238
things that you're echoing out like
when you're writing Bash scripts.

22
00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:30.132
Color makes it very easy
to parse things out.

23
00:01:30.132 --> 00:01:33.717
So you can say, if this is green,
it means it passed,

24
00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:36.050
if it's red, it means it failed.

25
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.516
And the way that it's doing
is these escape things.

26
00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:40.187
And if I don't do this -e,

27
00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:45.136
it's actually going to literally output
this string which is not what you want,

28
00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:50.337
the -e means go through, and make sure
that you're finding the color characters.

29
00:01:50.337 --> 00:01:53.858
Now, I typically don't do
this very much myself.

30
00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:58.097
I'll use other libraries, there's Bash
things that you can include that will help

31
00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:01.975
you do colors or, in general, when I'm
getting that in depth in something,

32
00:02:01.975 --> 00:02:05.456
I'll write it note I'll use something
like chalk to help with that.

33
00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:06.476
But that's how you do it.

34
00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:16.147
And then one of the last things I'll
just share with you really quick

35
00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:18.946
is there's a thing called Awesome Bash.

36
00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.226
It's on GitHub.

37
00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:24.242
So github.com/awesome-lists/awesome-bash.

38
00:02:24.242 --> 00:02:27.983
Awesome Bash,
that's a tongue twister for me.

39
00:02:27.983 --> 00:02:33.027
And this is just a huge long list
of very cool stuff that you can do

40
00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:39.223
with Bash everything from how to do
aliases which we didn't talk a lot about.

41
00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:41.737
Bash git prompt that was one of
them that I was just talking about.

42
00:02:41.737 --> 00:02:45.780
Bash powerline, that's the one that
I did just show you how to do.

43
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.605
There's a bunch of really
cool stuff in here.

44
00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:49.758
That's where I found the 2048 game.

45
00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:53.784
So if you want to dig in and find some
other really cool stuff you can do with

46
00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:56.702
Bash, definitely a good
place to come check it out.

47
00:02:56.702 --> 00:02:58.555
Definitely more materials for
you to learn.

48
00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:03.309
All right.

49
00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:08.477
Any questions about
customizing your shells or

50
00:03:08.477 --> 00:03:11.324
colors or anything else?

51
00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:14.574
I talked about changing your caps
lock earlier in the course but

52
00:03:14.574 --> 00:03:18.495
I left another note here if you want to
learn how to change your caps lock key to

53
00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:19.684
be control or escape.
