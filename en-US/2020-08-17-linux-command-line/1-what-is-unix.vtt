1
00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.139
I wanna talk a little bit more
what you can expect to learn,

2
00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:04.440
like more specifically.

3
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.214
So you can kinda set some expectations.

4
00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:10.026
You could jump around between section
to section and that would be okay.

5
00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:14.656
There is a little bit that does
some concepts built on others.

6
00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:18.691
So if you try and invest to more advanced
concepts without taking the more beginner

7
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:20.222
ones, you might be confused.

8
00:00:20.222 --> 00:00:23.777
So I did put it in an order for a reason.

9
00:00:26.095 --> 00:00:29.624
But yeah, today I wanna introduce you
to what is Linux, so you can feel more

10
00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:33.671
comfortable with working at a different
operating system, if you're not already.

11
00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:36.690
What Linux can solve for you,
what the command line is,

12
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.188
how to navigate around the command line,
and how to accomplish some basic tasks and

13
00:00:41.188 --> 00:00:43.064
kind of customize it a little bit.

14
00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:46.610
So I hope you come out on the other side
a little bit more excited about Linux than

15
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.266
you entered.

16
00:00:51.434 --> 00:00:55.221
So I'm gonna give you a bit of
a history lesson on why Linux exists,

17
00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.450
why it's out there.

18
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.168
I think it's just useful for

19
00:00:59.168 --> 00:01:04.497
people to know why it was created and
where it came from.

20
00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:09.675
So Linux is a Unix based operating system.

21
00:01:09.675 --> 00:01:15.005
That means it derives heavenly inspiration
from Unix without actually being Unix.

22
00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:19.789
I'm sure you've heard those terms,
Linux and Unix.

23
00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.132
And these days, we tend to use
them almost interchangeably, but

24
00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:23.759
they are actually very different concepts.

25
00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.247
Unix was an operating system
invented at Bell Labs in the 70s.

26
00:01:27.247 --> 00:01:30.587
Bell Labs, which is eventually,
it was broken up and

27
00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:32.752
AT&amp;T was one of those companies.

28
00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:37.630
So you can relatively think of it as
AT&amp;T in the 70s, built this operating

29
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.688
system called Unix and
everyone liked and it was very popular.

30
00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:44.392
But you had to pay to use Unix and

31
00:01:44.392 --> 00:01:48.667
that kind of rubbed a lot
of people the wrong way.

32
00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:52.986
But a big part of what made Unix Unix
is they have the Unix philosophy,

33
00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:55.376
which actually became very popular.

34
00:01:55.376 --> 00:02:00.057
And whether or not you know you're likely
still writing code in some regards

35
00:02:00.057 --> 00:02:02.263
according to the Unix philosophy.

36
00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:05.888
So yeah,
that influence is still felt today.

37
00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:07.116
So I just wanted to highlight
to you what those are.

38
00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:10.659
It kind of helps you understand why
the tools are the way that they are.

39
00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:15.776
So the Unix philosophy is make
each program do one thing well.

40
00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:17.481
If you're gonna make it do more things,

41
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:20.905
you're better off creating a new program
rather than modifying an old program.

42
00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:25.728
That way you kinda have these old
programs that stay stable and

43
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:32.324
you can make new fresh things without the
burden of trying to maintain old patterns.

44
00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:35.170
Expect the output of every program to
be an input to another program and

45
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.546
that's kinda where we got
the ideas of streams and pipes.

46
00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:39.770
And we'll get to that,
there's a whole section on that.

47
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.289
But that's kind of the ideas that you
can take these disparate program and

48
00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:46.311
you can plug them together to
make bigger programs basically.

49
00:02:48.955 --> 00:02:53.827
Design and build software, even operating
systems, to be tried within weeks,

50
00:02:53.827 --> 00:02:57.424
so that you can ID it early and
iterate and get things right.

51
00:02:57.424 --> 00:03:01.203
And you can get user feedback, which I
appreciate that stuff that I do now.

52
00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:07.451
Yeah, and

53
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:11.395
use tools in preference to unskilled
help to lighten the programming task.

54
00:03:11.395 --> 00:03:13.187
So if you have a problem,
write a program that solves your problem.

55
00:03:13.187 --> 00:03:15.279
That's kind of the gist of that.

56
00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.128
So there's a lot of wisdom here,

57
00:03:19.128 --> 00:03:22.735
there's stuff that I still try to
incorporate in my day to day coding.

58
00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.090
So yeah, hope that's interesting to you.

59
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.207
So I kinda wanted to get into
the family tree of Unix and

60
00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.787
this looks like a mess
because it's a mess.

61
00:03:29.787 --> 00:03:35.809
[LAUGH] And this is like how people
can never agree on anything, right?

62
00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.763
Okay, so you have Unix down here,
this is in the 70s.

63
00:03:39.763 --> 00:03:44.339
And so that was like the base here, right?

64
00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:46.950
That's the Unix like operating system, and

65
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.808
then it branched off in pretty much
in two very strong directions.

66
00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:54.047
One of them was BSD,
which you might have heard of.

67
00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:58.750
Today, you can still use FreeBSD,
which is still around quite a bit.

68
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.572
But the BSD that you're probably
most familiar with would be Mac OS.

69
00:04:04.572 --> 00:04:07.291
Mac OS is a derivative of BSD.

70
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:11.692
And then you'll see over here
as well that you have the GNU as

71
00:04:11.692 --> 00:04:14.256
I've heard people call it or GNU.

72
00:04:14.256 --> 00:04:19.342
And then from there, we actually got
Linux from a fellow named Linus Torvalds.

73
00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.878
And then there's some other directions
that this has gone off as well.

74
00:04:22.878 --> 00:04:25.573
AIX, that's actually my dad used
to work on, believe it or not.

75
00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:31.914
There's Solaris from Sun and Oracle,
HP-UX, there's a bunch of them, right?

76
00:04:31.914 --> 00:04:36.413
But the ones that you're gonna be most
concerned with today are, I mean,

77
00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:38.383
BSD if you're on a Mac, right?

78
00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:39.802
So I'm running a Mac right now.

79
00:04:39.802 --> 00:04:42.456
This is a BSD based operating system and
Linux.

80
00:04:42.456 --> 00:04:44.581
But they're all considered a Unix like,
right?

81
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:49.282
And I say Unix like because they adhere
to very similar principles and APIs and

82
00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:50.738
all that kind of stuff.

83
00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:55.365
They actually are separate code
bases that work in different ways.

84
00:04:55.365 --> 00:05:00.083
But yeah, that's why they're so
similar, that's why Mac OS and

85
00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:02.281
Linux end up being so similar.

86
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:03.643
It's because they're
both derived from Unix.
