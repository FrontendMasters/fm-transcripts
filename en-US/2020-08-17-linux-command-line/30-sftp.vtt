WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.891
So I'm going to exit this so
that I'm back in my,

2
00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:07.143
this one is still in primary and
this one is still on secondary, right?

3
00:00:07.143 --> 00:00:11.043
So I still have two VMs up and running.

4
00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:14.360
We're going to set up how to do SFTP.

5
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.224
If you've been a web developer for
long enough, you know that the joys and

6
00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:24.115
the pains of deploying your app via FTP,
right?

7
00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:27.764
I think,
as soon as you say FTP to a developer,

8
00:00:27.764 --> 00:00:31.989
they're either going to like long for
simpler days.

9
00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.726
It's like, why do I need all this
like continuous integration and

10
00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:39.797
continuous deployment, and
why I just liked connecting my client, and

11
00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:42.686
just dragging and
dropping files across, right?

12
00:00:42.686 --> 00:00:47.489
But then every developer that's had to do
that has accidentally deleted the wrong

13
00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.595
file in production and brought down
their entire production server,

14
00:00:51.595 --> 00:00:53.558
present company included.

15
00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:55.549
So I'm actually gonna
show you how to do that,

16
00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.194
if you really wanna do that yourself.

17
00:00:57.194 --> 00:01:01.245
Like I'm gonna show you how
to blow up your server.

18
00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:02.539
[LAUGH] I'm just kidding.

19
00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.070
But I am gonna show you how to
move files between servers, right?

20
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.894
Like for example, if I had files that were
on primary,and I needed to get them to

21
00:01:10.894 --> 00:01:14.926
secondary, I'm gonna show you how
to do that connection via FTP,

22
00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:17.662
which is called File Transfer Protocol,
but

23
00:01:17.662 --> 00:01:23.260
specifically a variation of FTP called
SFTP, Secure File Transfer Protocol.

24
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:30.144
Okay, so all I can say is, buckle up.

25
00:01:30.144 --> 00:01:33.231
This is probably the hardest part of
what we're going to set up today.

26
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:38.369
If you're going to, assume you just
did the previous section with me

27
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.507
with the SSH keys and everything
like that, you're just going to say

28
00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:48.844
exactly the same command, just change
the SH to FTP and then hit Enter.

29
00:01:48.844 --> 00:01:49.374
I'm just kidding.

30
00:01:49.374 --> 00:01:50.191
This is the easiest thing.

31
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:51.370
We already set up the SSH part.

32
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.162
And so if you set up SSH,
you set up SFTP at the same time.

33
00:01:56.162 --> 00:02:01.244
So that's like one of the really, really
nice parts about SFTP is like when you

34
00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:06.480
set up SSH, you are inherently setting up
SFTP as well, because they use the same

35
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.486
protocol, they use the same ports,
like everything kind of works the same.

36
00:02:11.486 --> 00:02:14.337
So that's a really nice feature.

37
00:02:14.337 --> 00:02:16.027
You can disable, like so

38
00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:21.269
that maybe you don't want people to be
able to connect to your server via FTP.

39
00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.701
And you can disable it but by default,

40
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:28.197
it'll just work out of the box as long
as you make one or the other work.

41
00:02:28.197 --> 00:02:32.476
And so just by saying SFTP like that,

42
00:02:32.476 --> 00:02:37.316
I am now connected to secondary via SFTP.

43
00:02:37.316 --> 00:02:40.385
So this isn't quite exactly the same but
now everything works a little bit

44
00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:43.521
different like for example, tab
completion does not work inside of this.

45
00:02:43.521 --> 00:02:45.075
But now I can say pwd,

46
00:02:45.075 --> 00:02:50.367
you can see the remote working
directory that I'm in is /home/brian.

47
00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.764
And then if I say, lpwd,
the L standing for local,

48
00:02:53.764 --> 00:02:58.113
you can see that my local working
directory is in Ubuntu, right?

49
00:02:58.113 --> 00:03:04.639
So let's say I wanted to put a file
from my primary onto my secondary.

50
00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.705
So I'm going to say lls for
local list, right?

51
00:03:08.705 --> 00:03:14.293
And I can see, here's all the files
that I have here on my local computer,

52
00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:18.272
and just pick any file,
it doesn't really matter.

53
00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:22.827
I'm going to pick status.txt, right?

54
00:03:22.827 --> 00:03:29.940
So I wanna put my status.txt from my
local computer to my remote computer.

55
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.985
So I'm going to say, put status.txt.

56
00:03:35.985 --> 00:03:41.355
And you can see here,
that's really all it takes is now I have

57
00:03:41.355 --> 00:03:46.528
put from my local computer to
my remote computer, right?

58
00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:48.326
Now there's something really
nice you can do here.

59
00:03:48.326 --> 00:03:49.979
If I put exclamation point here,

60
00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.465
I can actually run commands
on my local computer.

61
00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:57.505
If I forgot to do something,
I can put I say,

62
00:03:57.505 --> 00:04:00.783
echo, hello this is Brian.

63
00:04:00.783 --> 00:04:05.125
Then I'm gonna put that into a file

64
00:04:05.125 --> 00:04:09.629
here called file-to-put.txt.

65
00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:16.042
So I can say,
exclamation point cat file-to-put.txt.

66
00:04:16.042 --> 00:04:19.992
And you can see, cool, I have this
file here called hello this is Brian.

67
00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:26.155
So I want to put that file, so
I'm gonna put put file-to-put.txt,

68
00:04:26.155 --> 00:04:33.477
and then I wanna rename it something else
so I can say, putted-file.txt, okay?

69
00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:37.777
So now if we go a little over here and
look at secondary, if I ls here, and

70
00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:42.036
I get out of here, you can see I have
putted file, hello this is Brian.

71
00:04:42.036 --> 00:04:45.674
So I'm moving files across
the network here, right?

72
00:04:48.077 --> 00:04:52.561
So coming back here, a lot of this
works like how you would expect, but

73
00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:56.209
if you forget, you can say help,
and this will just kinda

74
00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:00.540
help you through all the various
different things that you can do.

75
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.445
So you can do, I showed you that one,
ls, you can cd, right?

76
00:05:07.445 --> 00:05:09.006
So, where am I right now?

77
00:05:09.006 --> 00:05:13.887
On my remote directory,
I can say cd.., and now if I say,

78
00:05:13.887 --> 00:05:16.444
pwd, I'm in this directory.

79
00:05:16.444 --> 00:05:19.271
So I guess something to kind of keep
in mind when you're doing SFTP.

80
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:21.874
Normally, when you're on one computer,

81
00:05:21.874 --> 00:05:26.514
you're navigating around, you're in
one directory at one time, right?

82
00:05:26.514 --> 00:05:29.940
And when you're in SFTP,
you're on two directories, so you have

83
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.238
a local directory and a remote directory
that you're manning all at the same time.

84
00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:38.350
So again, I have a local working where I'm
in home, Ubuntu, and I can say lcd for

85
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.694
local change directory.

86
00:05:39.694 --> 00:05:43.369
And now they will both be in
home if I look at them, so

87
00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:47.915
I'm gonna change back both of
them to their home directories.

88
00:05:51.673 --> 00:05:52.366
That's interesting.

89
00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:55.870
All right, so
the remote one I want is Brian.

90
00:05:58.608 --> 00:05:59.341
There we go.

91
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:02.915
So now they're back in
their home directories.

92
00:06:02.915 --> 00:06:05.729
So just like you can put as well,

93
00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.328
you can also say,
let's say I wanted to get status.

94
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:15.028
And just like that you can say,
get status.txt, and

95
00:06:15.028 --> 00:06:18.589
I will call it, getted-status.txt.

96
00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:19.421
And by that way,

97
00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:23.179
I can download files from the remote
server onto my local computer as well.

98
00:06:24.314 --> 00:06:29.888
And that's really about it.

99
00:06:29.888 --> 00:06:31.171
This is where tar comes in very useful,
the command I showed you earlier.

100
00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:35.441
This is useful because you can
bundle up a bunch of files and

101
00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:41.122
you can just get one file instead of
having to go and get every individual one.

102
00:06:41.122 --> 00:06:42.794
But yeah, that's it.

103
00:06:42.794 --> 00:06:45.218
That's how SFTP works.

104
00:06:45.218 --> 00:06:47.071
This is another thing I
use pretty frequently,

105
00:06:47.071 --> 00:06:50.187
especially when I'm working with remote
servers of just moving files around.

106
00:06:50.187 --> 00:06:51.123
It's pretty convenient.

107
00:06:53.716 --> 00:06:55.189
So I guess, yeah, it does bear mentioning.

108
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:58.765
So I've just shown you SFTP,
which I say these days

109
00:06:58.765 --> 00:07:03.269
is probably the most common way of doing,
moving files around.

110
00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:06.393
There is FTP, just plain FTP,
and that's an older variant.

111
00:07:06.393 --> 00:07:08.318
You have to set it up separately.

112
00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:11.952
Whereas like, this is nice cuz you set up
SSH and you can apparently set up SFTP.

113
00:07:11.952 --> 00:07:15.299
When you're setting up FTP,
you have to set it up differently.

114
00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:17.023
It works on a different protocol.

115
00:07:17.023 --> 00:07:21.376
It requires different keys and that kind
of stuff, and it's just less secure.

116
00:07:21.376 --> 00:07:23.187
Whereas SFTP, it's all locked down.

117
00:07:23.187 --> 00:07:27.796
It's all going through SSH, which is
a very secure communication protocol.

118
00:07:27.796 --> 00:07:31.226
So this includes your use for
the secondary VM, right?

119
00:07:31.226 --> 00:07:33.332
So you can go ahead and shut it down.

120
00:07:33.332 --> 00:07:35.622
You can delete it,
you can do whatever you want, but

121
00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:37.820
we're not going to use
the secondary VM anymore.

122
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.120
So in this particular case,
I'm just going to say, exit.

123
00:07:42.215 --> 00:07:45.612
And I'm going to, yeah,
get out of there, our of SFTP.

124
00:07:45.612 --> 00:07:50.238
One of my favorite things is the way
you get out of SFTP to say, bye,

125
00:07:50.238 --> 00:07:52.313
that's it, and it's done.

126
00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.640
You can also say, quit and exit.

127
00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.138
There's a couple ways to say,
but because by works,

128
00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:01.411
I feel compelled to do it that way.
