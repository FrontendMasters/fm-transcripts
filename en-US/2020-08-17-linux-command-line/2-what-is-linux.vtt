1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.967
So getting to Linux,
Linux isn't directly Unix,

2
00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:07.797
it's not like you have the Unix codebase,
they took that and they made that Linux.

3
00:00:07.797 --> 00:00:12.110
What happened with Linux is this guy,
Linus Torvalds like sat in a room and

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.845
basically created his own version of Unix,
and he tried to be compatible where it

5
00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:21.254
made sense but he also branched off in
his own directions when he wanted to.

6
00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:26.100
Cuz at the time there was no free and
open source version of Unix that he was

7
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.715
satisfied with and that's because
BSD was not out yet at that point.

8
00:00:30.715 --> 00:00:34.044
BSD by the way, I think stands for
Berkeley Software Distribution, yeah,

9
00:00:34.044 --> 00:00:35.614
Berkeley Software Distribution.

10
00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:40.880
I learned that when I was researching for
this course.

11
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.747
So yeah, Linus was unsatisfied
with the free offerings.

12
00:00:42.747 --> 00:00:45.756
BSD didn't exist when he started, but

13
00:00:45.756 --> 00:00:49.411
it did exist by the time
that he finished Linux.

14
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:54.239
Yeah, and something I found interesting
about Linux is actually he didn't

15
00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.238
want to call it Linux cuz they
thought it would be too considered

16
00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:00.434
to name something after himself.

17
00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:04.034
So they went through a couple names
before they actually landed on Linux.

18
00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:06.325
Actually, I don't even
think it was someone else.

19
00:01:06.325 --> 00:01:09.625
It was someone else that actually said no,
you're gonna call Linux and

20
00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.829
that that's what actually
ended up sticking.

21
00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:17.366
So suffice to say, Linux is extremely
important to modern computing.

22
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:21.637
As of the writing of this course, all
top 500 supercomputers run on Linux and

23
00:01:21.637 --> 00:01:25.208
that's a relatively recent change
that there were some that ran on

24
00:01:25.208 --> 00:01:29.378
different operating systems, but
as of today, all top 500 run on Linux.

25
00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:32.978
Much of the mobile phone market
shares on Linux which is Android,

26
00:01:32.978 --> 00:01:34.640
which is a Linux derivative.

27
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.514
And pretty much almost all of
the websites that you know and

28
00:01:38.514 --> 00:01:40.332
love are running on Linux.

29
00:01:40.332 --> 00:01:45.154
Some of them are running on Windows but
many of them are running on Linux.

30
00:01:45.154 --> 00:01:48.612
Me personally like all of my
servers that I ever do for for

31
00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:51.788
work has always been on Linux for
my entire career.

32
00:01:54.946 --> 00:01:58.316
So, why would you choose Linux over
something like say like Windows which is

33
00:01:58.316 --> 00:02:01.490
obviously I work at Microsoft,
I think it's a fine operating system.

34
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.780
I have my Windows computer right here.

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.469
Probably slightly off of frame for
that you can see but

36
00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:08.154
I use Windows quite a bit as well.

37
00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:12.725
But why do people continue to choose Linux
over other things they could choose?

38
00:02:12.725 --> 00:02:16.613
Well, the first thing that's probably
important to a lot of companies and

39
00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:18.711
probably many of you is that it's free.

40
00:02:18.711 --> 00:02:19.390
It's free.

41
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.439
It's open source.

42
00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.241
It's online.

43
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.383
You never ever have to pay there's
no one to pay for it right?

44
00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:28.295
So that's important for college
students that need an operating system.

45
00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:29.985
But it's also important for

46
00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:33.937
like really big companies that
have tens of thousands of servers.

47
00:02:33.937 --> 00:02:39.030
That's millions and millions of dollars
of licensing that they don't have to pay.

48
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.131
It's very well maintained because it's so
widespread.

49
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:45.217
There's just a ton of
eyes looking at it and

50
00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:49.251
there's multiple companies
that their entire thing,

51
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:54.686
their entire reason of being is to work
on Linux like Redhat and Canonical.

52
00:02:54.686 --> 00:02:59.142
And so there's a lot of really smart
people working at Linux at any given time.

53
00:02:59.142 --> 00:03:00.655
So it's very well maintained.

54
00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:03.289
If you have like real bugs,
people are going to find them.

55
00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.111
You can report them and
you yourself can contribute,

56
00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:08.932
if Linux doesn't do something
that you need it to do,

57
00:03:08.932 --> 00:03:12.395
you are also welcome to hop into
the mailing list and contribute.

58
00:03:12.395 --> 00:03:15.138
It runs just about anywhere.

59
00:03:15.138 --> 00:03:17.155
It runs on Intel processors.

60
00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.025
It runs on AMD.

61
00:03:18.025 --> 00:03:20.304
It runs on ARM,
it runs of Internet of Things.

62
00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:23.560
It runs on phones, fridges, cars.

63
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.450
If it has a processor in it, chances
are you can probably run Linux on it.

64
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.933
Well, chances are it's probably
already running the Linux.

65
00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:38.668
I know of Teslas, for example, and Audis
run Linux on the car, so it's everywhere.

66
00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:44.121
Most of the things you need for
it already exist.

67
00:03:44.121 --> 00:03:48.201
Being around from the 70s and so
many people using it means that if you

68
00:03:48.201 --> 00:03:52.985
have a problem, chances are someone else
already had your problem and solved it.

69
00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:57.047
So there's a great ecosystem around it.

70
00:03:57.047 --> 00:04:00.339
And just the knowledge base for
Linux is enormous, right?

71
00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:03.443
It's a huge business.

72
00:04:03.443 --> 00:04:07.757
So if you know Linux there's a good
chance you can get a job doing Linux and

73
00:04:07.757 --> 00:04:10.303
if you need to hire someone, chances are,

74
00:04:10.303 --> 00:04:14.374
there's many experts out there that
are waiting to be hired for it.

75
00:04:14.374 --> 00:04:17.145
So that's kind of the ecosystem reasons.

76
00:04:17.145 --> 00:04:21.372
It's also just technically predictable,
I think, and stable.

77
00:04:21.372 --> 00:04:26.079
And I think that really inspires a lot
of confidence in a lot of people.

78
00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:31.399
So we're gonna talk about all of
these things I'm just kidding.

79
00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:35.955
I don't know anything about anything that
I'm showing on the screen right now.

80
00:04:35.955 --> 00:04:39.480
But I want to show you like this is
actually the disparate pieces of what

81
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.630
makes Linux, Linux.

82
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.777
So this is actually the kernel which
is kind of the core part of Linux.

83
00:04:45.777 --> 00:04:50.736
And this is kind of what goes into the
kernel and how it relates to each other.

84
00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:53.569
Again, I don't really know
anything about this, but

85
00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.151
I wanted to show you that it can be
distilled down to a graphic anyway.

86
00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:01.580
And again, I got this from Wikipedia you
can see down here here's the citation.

87
00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:07.601
But I wanted to get to what
makes something a Linux and

88
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:12.487
what makes something a distribution,
because for me until I researched it,

89
00:05:12.487 --> 00:05:17.239
it actually was kinda unclear to me as
why is Ubuntu different from RedHat.

90
00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.927
Why are those two separate things?

91
00:05:18.927 --> 00:05:21.150
What do they share?
What makes Linux, Linux?

92
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.319
And the answer to that question is
they all share the same microkernel,

93
00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:29.363
which is like the central part that
does all of these things, right?

94
00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:33.838
So it handles memory, it handles
scheduling, it handles processes,

95
00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:37.953
it handles the file system,
all that stuff is part of the kernel.

96
00:05:37.953 --> 00:05:44.006
So all of Redhat and Ubuntu and Debian and
Mint, those are all sharing that kernel,

97
00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:47.915
and then they're building stuff around it,
right?

98
00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:50.434
And that's what you'd
call a distribution or

99
00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.962
often they're just called distros, right?

100
00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:55.311
And there are so so so
many distros, right?

101
00:05:55.311 --> 00:06:00.100
There's one Linux kernel, but there's a
billion different distributions of Linux.

102
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.642
And they all kind of specialise
in different things.

103
00:06:02.642 --> 00:06:05.195
In this class,
we're going to be going over Ubuntu,

104
00:06:05.195 --> 00:06:08.883
which is just the one that I've used
the most and probably the most common, so

105
00:06:08.883 --> 00:06:11.349
it's probably the most useful for
you to learn on.

106
00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.514
But I'm by no means asserting this is
the only one that you should use or

107
00:06:15.514 --> 00:06:16.791
anything like that.

108
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.445
I'm pretty sure there's someone in
the chat that fight me that Arch is like

109
00:06:20.445 --> 00:06:24.099
the best thing ever and that we should
all be using Kali Linux and then Mint on

110
00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:27.995
our phones and I don't know, there's
just so many different distributions.

111
00:06:27.995 --> 00:06:31.482
But these distributions they'll add
software on top of the kernel so

112
00:06:31.482 --> 00:06:34.068
they'll have like different
desktop experiences

113
00:06:34.068 --> 00:06:38.217
they'll have different programs,
they'll have different package managers,

114
00:06:38.217 --> 00:06:41.368
they'll have different
networking capabilities, right?

115
00:06:41.368 --> 00:06:44.341
They kind of take those
microkernel abilities and

116
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:47.394
they expand that out into
a full operating system.

117
00:06:47.394 --> 00:06:51.668
So hopefully that kind of demystifies
a little bit like what's the difference

118
00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:55.165
between what makes something Linux and
what a distribution is.

119
00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:58.688
The one thing I did want to call
about Ubuntu is it's a downstream

120
00:06:58.688 --> 00:07:01.764
distribution of another
distribution called Debian.

121
00:07:01.764 --> 00:07:05.113
So Debian has been around forever, and

122
00:07:05.113 --> 00:07:09.589
it's one of the more popular
Linux distributions.

123
00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:11.141
I actually still use it quite a bit.

124
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:15.051
Like if you download the Node.js
container off of Docker Hub,

125
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:18.981
it's actually deviant image
which I found very interesting.

126
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:22.000
So Ubuntu kind of took Debian and
polish it up and

127
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.327
made it like the user
experience a little bit nicer.

128
00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:31.057
Ubuntu is backed by a company called
Canonical and they're a great company.

129
00:07:31.057 --> 00:07:33.558
And so that's kind of why I
choose Ubuntu over Debian.

130
00:07:33.558 --> 00:07:37.560
And there's actually even a downstream
from Ubuntu called Mint as well.

131
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.838
So if you want to even go further down
the line that's possible as well.

132
00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:46.968
Ubuntu is just a good one to learn
because it's very flexible in all

133
00:07:46.968 --> 00:07:51.762
of its applications, it can apply to
internet of things, it can literally be

134
00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:56.218
like your desktop computer's
operating system, it can run servers.

135
00:07:56.218 --> 00:07:57.733
It's all over the place.

136
00:07:57.733 --> 00:08:00.445
So that's a good reason to learn
Ubuntu is it's flexible and

137
00:08:00.445 --> 00:08:01.783
all the things that it can do.

138
00:08:01.783 --> 00:08:05.247
But I'm going to just toss down
here at the bottom you can see

139
00:08:05.247 --> 00:08:09.004
I threw a couple more that I have used and
I think are pretty good.

140
00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:12.705
One being Debian, Mint is another
one that's based on Ubuntu.

141
00:08:12.705 --> 00:08:16.036
RedHat that's another like very
enterprisey like large scale server.

142
00:08:16.036 --> 00:08:19.112
It's actually owned by IBM now.

143
00:08:19.112 --> 00:08:20.605
Alpine I use quite a bit.

144
00:08:20.605 --> 00:08:23.480
Alpine is for
making very minimal containers.

145
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.251
And we're not gonna be talking at
all about containers today, but

146
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:31.575
there's another great Frontend Masters
course on containers by this guy.

147
00:08:31.575 --> 00:08:36.394
[LAUGH] So if you want to learn about
containers that's out there as well.

148
00:08:36.394 --> 00:08:40.714
Kali, there's Arch is another
one that didn't have on here,

149
00:08:40.714 --> 00:08:45.289
CentOS like there's a bunch of stuff
that you can get into as well.

150
00:08:45.289 --> 00:08:48.838
So that's kind of the history
of like what is Linux?

151
00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:51.411
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Is the question about what is

152
00:08:51.411 --> 00:08:52.460
downstream?

153
00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.221
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

154
00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:57.591
So when I'm saying downstream.

155
00:08:57.591 --> 00:09:00.837
So there's a distribution of
Linux called Debian, right?

156
00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:05.953
There's a open source community
that maintains Debian and

157
00:09:05.953 --> 00:09:12.308
that's the lowest level or lowest level
is not the correct term for that.

158
00:09:12.308 --> 00:09:15.889
So Debian is like the mother
distribution here, right?

159
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.505
And then they take Debian,

160
00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:22.441
and they add more code on top of it that
makes it a downstream distribution, right.

161
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.303
So there's Debian and
then they build stuff on top of it and

162
00:09:24.303 --> 00:09:25.032
that makes it Ubuntu.

163
00:09:25.032 --> 00:09:28.689
And then they build stuff on top of
that and it makes it Mint, right?

164
00:09:28.689 --> 00:09:33.153
So they're taking a base distribution that
someone else has made or a whole community

165
00:09:33.153 --> 00:09:37.313
has made and they're adding stuff around
it, that's what downstream means.

166
00:09:37.313 --> 00:09:43.719
So, Ubuntu is downstream from Debian,
in that respect.

167
00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:45.445
Clear as mud?

168
00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:46.304
Probably.
