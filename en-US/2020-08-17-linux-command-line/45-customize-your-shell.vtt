00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.213
So let's go on to how to
customize your shell.

2
00:00:04.213 --> 00:00:07.085
Every developer likes to
modify their tools and

3
00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:10.613
have everything very personalized
to what they wanna do.

4
00:00:10.613 --> 00:00:14.730
I'm lazy and so in general,
trying to use the default for tools, so

5
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.877
that when I move from computer to computer
that I don't have to customize very much.

6
00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:23.115
But I look at some of my coworker's
terminals and VS codes, and

7
00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:26.475
they have very specific themes,
and various specific prompts,

8
00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:28.449
and all that sorts of stuff like that.

9
00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.978
So I'm going to show you how you can start
venturing into modifying some of those

10
00:00:32.978 --> 00:00:33.526
things.

11
00:00:33.526 --> 00:00:38.610
So the first thing that I want
to tell you about, there you go.

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.856
There's the next file that I created.

13
00:00:40.856 --> 00:00:44.831
Okay, so next thing I want to
tell you about is this prompt,

14
00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:50.090
this part right here that you have at
the beginning is actually customizable.

15
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.052
It's a variable called PS1.

16
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:57.258
So if I say echo $PS1, you'll see
that it's this goop right there.

17
00:00:57.258 --> 00:01:01.195
And it's telling you
the first part is the user,

18
00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:04.566
then it has an @, which is this, right?

19
00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:09.819
And then it has what the name of the host
is, which is probably what all of that is.

20
00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:14.359
Then it has a colon,
which would be this colon right there.

21
00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.994
Then the \w is the path that you're in,
and then the \$ is

22
00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:24.302
actually just literally a $, so
that's what that PS1 prompt is.

23
00:01:24.302 --> 00:01:31.575
But for this,
I can actually say PS1="hello there ".

24
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.561
And so you can see there now,
my prompt is just hello there,

25
00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.759
Which is probably not the best prompt.

26
00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.030
But I've also see people,

27
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.080
you can just do this if you want
something really simple, right?

28
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.442
And now it's just $, it's not busy at all.

29
00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:56.405
You can do stuff like
put the date in there.

30
00:01:56.405 --> 00:02:03.735
But the thing is there's a bunch of
customizations you can do for this.

31
00:02:03.735 --> 00:02:07.008
But a lot of people have already done
this before and made it really cool.

32
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.575
And so I've never bothered to figure out
the crazy languages that I need to know to

33
00:02:11.575 --> 00:02:14.406
customize it,
I might just use someone else's.

34
00:02:14.406 --> 00:02:17.391
So I'm gonna show you how to do
one of the more popular ones,

35
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:18.842
which is called powerline.

36
00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:23.772
So I'm gonna say curl, and actually I'm
just gonna grab it out of the course notes

37
00:02:23.772 --> 00:02:26.564
because I don't want to
type this all myself.

38
00:02:26.564 --> 00:02:32.720
But we're gonna curl and bash something,
I told you not to do earlier,

39
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.069
which is in the customizing your shell,
this one right here.

40
00:02:42.798 --> 00:02:47.687
And we're just going to paste that, so

41
00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:54.514
this is gonna go get
a installation file off of GitHub.

42
00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:58.022
Okay, and then we have tat bash,

43
00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.961
To .bash, What did they call it?

44
00:03:08.961 --> 00:03:11.154
.bash-powerline.

45
00:03:11.154 --> 00:03:14.975
So you can see here, this is the long
script that it's gonna go and

46
00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:17.980
set everything up so
that we can have a cool prompt.

47
00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:28.998
And so what I'm gonna do now is I'm
gonna go into my .bashrc, vi .bashrc.

48
00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:31.354
And I'm gonna put another
line underneath here.

49
00:03:31.354 --> 00:03:35.756
That's gonna be source

50
00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:41.702
~/.bash-powerline.sh.

51
00:03:44.826 --> 00:03:48.574
Okay, and now every single time
that I start up my bash here,

52
00:03:48.574 --> 00:03:53.513
it's going to run this file, which is
gonna set my prompt to be something cool.

53
00:03:53.513 --> 00:03:55.095
So I'm just gonna run that directly.

54
00:03:55.095 --> 00:04:01.577
Now I'm gonna say source .bash-powerline.

55
00:04:01.577 --> 00:04:04.370
And now you can see, it's got color.

56
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.210
So if I go up a directory,
it's gonna do that.

57
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.226
If I go back into ubuntu, okay, so

58
00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:16.431
right now it looks colorful,
and looks a little bit nicer.

59
00:04:16.431 --> 00:04:18.334
But let me show you why this
actually can be pretty cool.

60
00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:22.249
Let's make a director, my-git-project.

61
00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:26.740
If I cd into my-git-project,
and I do a git init,

62
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.341
so then it actually has
the name of my branch on here.

63
00:04:31.341 --> 00:04:37.044
If I say git checkout -b another-project,

64
00:04:37.044 --> 00:04:41.851
it'll keep track of the branch here.

65
00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:48.239
I think if I get behind and commits from
GitHub, it'll let me know all that stuff.

66
00:04:48.239 --> 00:04:49.941
So, it does a bunch of
cool stuff like that.

67
00:04:49.941 --> 00:04:54.574
The only reason I show you all of this is
just to let you know there are other cool

68
00:04:54.574 --> 00:04:58.944
prompts out there, and powerline
being possibly the most popular one.

69
00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:02.014
It would be difficult to say it, but
it certainly amongst the most popular one.

70
00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:08.479
The one that I use on Mac is one called
git bash prompt, which is a good one.

71
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.170
It's a little bit more simple,
a little less colorful.

72
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.406
The one I use for Zsh is called spaceship,
which is really cool.

73
00:05:14.406 --> 00:05:16.369
So you can check out that one.

74
00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:17.997
Yeah, in fact, I'll show you right now.

75
00:05:17.997 --> 00:05:23.169
This is one called, Spaceship,

76
00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.802
and I think it's just for Zsh.

77
00:05:25.802 --> 00:05:29.108
But if I go into personal/linux-cli,

78
00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:33.492
you can see here it tells me
I'm on the master branch.

79
00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:36.856
The package is v.1 because it's
reading that I have a package.json and

80
00:05:36.856 --> 00:05:37.624
it'll tell me.

81
00:05:37.624 --> 00:05:40.836
And by the way,
you're running node 12.16.0.

82
00:05:40.836 --> 00:05:46.169
It puts Kubernetes information in there,
it puts docker information in there.

83
00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:47.871
It does a bunch of really
cool stuff like that.
