1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.643
The next thing that we're gonna
talk about is package management.

2
00:00:04.643 --> 00:00:09.321
So one of the best parts about Ubuntu and
Linux in general is,

3
00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:13.013
there's a package for
generally everything.

4
00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:18.618
Most things follow that Unix philosophy of
every program should do one thing well,

5
00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:22.394
and so there's a lot of packages
that do one thing well.

6
00:00:22.394 --> 00:00:23.455
And this is kinda like NPM, right?

7
00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:26.514
Like NPM, you have a bunch of mini
packages that do one thing and

8
00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:30.583
you use those mini packages to make bigger
programs that do bigger things, right?

9
00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:34.623
And that's kind of
the philosophy here as well.

10
00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:39.256
So, every big Linux distribution
comes with its own package manager.

11
00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:46.537
So, for example, Ubuntu has APT which is,
advanced package.

12
00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.574
Advanced package,
I can't remember anyway, APT.

13
00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:55.116
APT, I always call it APT,
I don't know if you're supposed to, but

14
00:00:55.116 --> 00:00:56.717
that's always what I call it.

15
00:00:56.717 --> 00:01:01.240
Advanced packaging tool,
that's what APT is.

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.690
But that's just for Ubuntu,
that's only Ubuntu's tool.

17
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.865
Debian has dpkg,
which is also available on Ubuntu,

18
00:01:09.865 --> 00:01:15.853
because APT or, sorry, rather,
Ubuntu is based on Debian.

19
00:01:15.853 --> 00:01:18.261
So you can also use dpkg,
it's just a lower level,

20
00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:21.850
a bit more difficult to wrangle tool,
whereas APT is a very nice tool to use.

21
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.609
Red has rhel, something or no,

22
00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.773
sorry rhel is the name
of the distribution.

23
00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:32.778
It has RPM, Red Hat package manager.

24
00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:38.464
There's yum,
yum is also another one for rhel.

25
00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.940
There's APK which is for Alpine.

26
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.481
There's a bunch of various
different tools that we use.

27
00:01:44.481 --> 00:01:47.812
But so far to say,
today we're just gonna focus on APT.

28
00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:54.498
But yeah, I did want you to know
that dpkg,does actually exist.

29
00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:55.471
It's already installed on there.

30
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:56.812
You can use it if you want to.

31
00:01:56.812 --> 00:02:00.146
I've never had an opportunity
that I didn't want to use APT.

32
00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:07.154
So Yeah, so let's go ahead and
get started on APT.

33
00:02:07.154 --> 00:02:08.792
The one thing I was gonna show you.

34
00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:13.632
Before I get into APT there actually is
like a really nice tool for managing APT.

35
00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:21.146
So if I put in sudo APT install Aptitude,

36
00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:27.336
this one right here, Aptitude.

37
00:02:27.336 --> 00:02:30.876
It is gonna say, hey, I'm gonna download a
bunch of different things, that's typical.

38
00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:35.430
It's kinda like NPM where you have to
install 20 thousand packages to get one

39
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.888
same sort of thing here.

40
00:02:36.888 --> 00:02:40.473
So I'm gonna say yes,
it's gonna go out to the Network,

41
00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:42.873
it's gonna install a bunch of stuff.

42
00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:49.261
And then it's going to
let me run aptitude.

43
00:02:49.261 --> 00:02:52.038
So aptitude, I'm not gonna really
show you too much about it.

44
00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.963
But what's cool about aptitude is,

45
00:02:53.963 --> 00:02:58.073
it's actually like a really nice front
end to the package manager for Ubuntu.

46
00:02:58.073 --> 00:03:01.537
So you can see what I have installed,
you can see what I have to upgrade.

47
00:03:01.537 --> 00:03:04.920
You can see here that I have all
these various different packages that

48
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.154
are already installed.

49
00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:08.403
Here's things that need to be upgraded.

50
00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:10.477
Kind of cool stuff, right?

51
00:03:10.477 --> 00:03:13.667
So, this is really nice to be like we
wanna browse around, see what I have,

52
00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:15.857
what's available to update,
that kind of stuff.

53
00:03:15.857 --> 00:03:19.301
And then as soon as I hit Ctrl C,
it'll exit out of it.

54
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.887
And so
aptitude is not installed by default, but

55
00:03:21.887 --> 00:03:24.105
it is a tool made by canonical and Ubuntu.

56
00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:26.175
So it's a tool you can trust, right?

57
00:03:26.175 --> 00:03:29.838
So just be aware of its existence, okay?

58
00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:38.200
So I wanna take a second and
talk about apt-get versus APT,

59
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.214
or APT versus apt-get, right?

60
00:03:42.214 --> 00:03:46.856
So you'll see a lot of tutorials
that do apt-get like this, right?

61
00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:50.073
And then you'll do apt-get install and
then blah blah blah.

62
00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:51.787
Why is there two of them?

63
00:03:51.787 --> 00:03:54.449
Why is there apt-get install and
APT install?

64
00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.519
apt-get is the old one,
APT is the new one.

65
00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.502
So in other words, apt-get still works,
I think it'll work forever,

66
00:04:02.502 --> 00:04:06.566
it has some various different behaviors
that are more advanced than APT.

67
00:04:06.566 --> 00:04:10.549
So it'll stay there because they just
wanna maintain backwards compatibility.

68
00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.155
But APT install is the new one,
go ahead and just use that one.

69
00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:19.617
Yeah, it's just meant to be easier.

70
00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:21.655
So APT is meant to be
an easier tool to use.

71
00:04:21.655 --> 00:04:26.125
It's much meant to be simpler and
easier to use, for them 99% use case, and

72
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:31.359
they keep asking around if you need to do
some wild stuff that I've never had to do.

73
00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:34.599
Okay, so
the next thing I want you all to install,

74
00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.930
is one of my very favorite
programs called lolcat.

75
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.542
So please, at this point,

76
00:04:42.542 --> 00:04:48.163
do apt install lolcat like that.

77
00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:52.356
Now it's gonna say, hey, you don't
have permissions to install this, and

78
00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:55.196
that's because when you're
running apt install,

79
00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:57.733
you actually do have to
do sudo apt install it.

80
00:04:57.733 --> 00:05:01.405
Now if you remember,
if you do exclamation exclamation point,

81
00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:03.924
it's going to rerun the previous command.

82
00:05:03.924 --> 00:05:06.819
So if I do sudo exclamation
point exclamation point,

83
00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.083
it's gonna run sudo apt install lolcat.

84
00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:13.571
So that's like exclusively when I
use the double exclamation points or

85
00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:15.271
the bang bang.

86
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:17.029
So you can actually see it.

87
00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.097
The next time it shows you,
this is actually what I ended up running.

88
00:05:20.097 --> 00:05:23.837
So I'm gonna say yes,
that's what I wanna install.

89
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.057
Okay, so now we have a new
program that we've installed,

90
00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:37.939
lolcat, and
it makes our terminal very colorful.

91
00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.988
So even the help text is very colorful.

92
00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.228
So is lolcat very similar to cat,

93
00:05:45.228 --> 00:05:50.756
it just makes whatever it's
catting out rainbow colored.

94
00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:56.402
So if I say cat log.txt,
you can see that this is what it outputs,

95
00:05:56.402 --> 00:06:03.910
but if I say lolcat log.txt, you can see
it's much improved and much better, right?

96
00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:10.761
Now what's cool about this is,
some random user somewhere wrote lolcat.

97
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:14.283
And we can now install
that wherever we want,

98
00:06:14.283 --> 00:06:19.765
just because they wrote that for us and
they put it on the apt registry.

99
00:06:22.626 --> 00:06:27.431
So actually another one of the frontend
masters instructors, Sarah Dresner,

100
00:06:27.431 --> 00:06:31.230
every time that she runs ls,
she actually has it like set up, so

101
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.331
it always runs it through lolcat.

102
00:06:33.331 --> 00:06:37.010
So this is always what it
looks like when she runs ls.

103
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:42.450
Which I have to say,
is pretty fabulous, right?

104
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.835
This just makes me a little bit happier
every single time that I have to go

105
00:06:46.835 --> 00:06:47.357
run ls.

106
00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:52.255
So yeah, credit to Sarah Dresner for
showing that one to me.

107
00:06:52.255 --> 00:06:56.981
And I linked an article in
the course notes here that you

108
00:06:56.981 --> 00:07:00.897
can actually go out and
set that up yourself.

109
00:07:00.897 --> 00:07:04.136
Sarah wrote a funny little
article of how to do that.

110
00:07:04.136 --> 00:07:08.849
So I wanna be able to run node, but you
can see this computer does not have node.

111
00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:12.910
So if I try and run node,
it says, hey, no, it's not here,

112
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.843
do you want to install node?

113
00:07:14.843 --> 00:07:19.949
Yes I do, so I'm gonna say,
just copy and paste that,

114
00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.067
and I'm gonna go out and install node.js.

115
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:29.730
So now if I come in here and
I say node again,

116
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.805
it's gonna drop me into the Node REPL.

117
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:40.210
Or I can go ahead and
run something like no-e,

118
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:44.637
which is going to execute
whatever you put in the quotes.

119
00:07:44.637 --> 00:07:50.720
Console.log.hello from node.

120
00:07:53.429 --> 00:07:56.450
Now you can see, this ran node.js,
it ran a console log and

121
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.552
it says hello from node,
which is exactly what we saw there.

122
00:07:59.552 --> 00:08:01.634
So pretty easy.

123
00:08:01.634 --> 00:08:04.917
I did want to show you that can
do apt search for node js, and

124
00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:08.210
this is probably gonna show
you a bunch of things, right?

125
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.870
So these are all the various
different node js

126
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.740
things that are available
to install off of apt.

127
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.240
And then I can also say apt, show node js.

128
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.621
And it's gonna show me all of
the information about node js that it has.

129
00:08:21.621 --> 00:08:26.210
It has all these different versions,
it's maintained by these people.

130
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:27.870
It's priorities extra,

131
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.873
I think that means it's like they
keep a very close watch on it.

132
00:08:31.873 --> 00:08:38.830
Whereas like if we said apt show lolcat,
You can see, I guess, extra as well.

133
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.691
So I actually don't even
know priority is there, but

134
00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:44.693
you can see these are all
the various maintainers of it.

135
00:08:44.693 --> 00:08:48.873
So for example, you didn't know but
lolcat was actually written in Ruby.

136
00:08:48.873 --> 00:08:50.333
I didn't know that until I looked at that.

137
00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:52.608
So that's interesting.

138
00:08:55.611 --> 00:08:57.444
Cool.

139
00:08:57.444 --> 00:09:00.081
So that's kind of a whirlwind
tour of how to use apt.

140
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.916
I use it quite a bit because you
can go out there and install,

141
00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:05.147
there's different utilities that you need.

142
00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:09.067
When you're doing things like setting up
Docker, it's really useful to use apt to

143
00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:12.439
install the various different packages
you need for your containers.

144
00:09:12.439 --> 00:09:15.001
Yeah, it's good.

145
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:20.656
Let's show you a couple more different
commands that are useful to know.

146
00:09:20.656 --> 00:09:24.000
There's sudo apt auto remove,
that's gonna go and

147
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.954
just clean up stuff that you
have that you really don't need.

148
00:09:27.954 --> 00:09:29.494
So it's gonna say,

149
00:09:29.494 --> 00:09:34.575
I found one package that you don't
need to have, so I'll say yes.

150
00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:38.216
And it's removing this grub-pc-bin,
cuz apparently nothing is installed and

151
00:09:38.216 --> 00:09:39.492
nothing is referring to it.

152
00:09:39.492 --> 00:09:40.664
So it just goes and removes it.

153
00:09:43.205 --> 00:09:46.779
Sudo apt update.

154
00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:48.669
So the way that apt actually works,

155
00:09:48.669 --> 00:09:52.200
is it downloads a list of all
available packages to your computer.

156
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:57.770
So if you do this update, it will
actually go get the new copy of that.

157
00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:02.329
Now, mine probably didn't
have that much to upgrade,

158
00:10:02.329 --> 00:10:04.957
cuz this is a very new copy of it.

159
00:10:04.957 --> 00:10:09.188
But if you run your Ubuntu for 30 or
40 days, there's probably gonna be

160
00:10:09.188 --> 00:10:12.632
a new version of various different
packages for you to have.

161
00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:14.535
So before you install something,

162
00:10:14.535 --> 00:10:18.272
it's usually a good idea to do an apt
update and then an apt install,

163
00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:22.094
to make sure that you're getting
the latest version of everything.

164
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.745
You can do a sudo, or
I like to assume it's an apt list, and

165
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:31.719
it'll list all of the packages
that you have installed.

166
00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:34.511
You can see it's a lot, right?

167
00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:38.270
So sometimes it's useful to
just say app list upgradeable.

168
00:10:39.992 --> 00:10:43.899
And here, from here, right?

169
00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:45.441
Here is everything that I could update.

170
00:10:45.441 --> 00:10:47.987
So this will let me know,
here's all the stuff you can go update.

171
00:10:47.987 --> 00:10:52.259
And if you wanna just go do that,

172
00:10:52.259 --> 00:10:56.069
you can do sudo apt upgrade.

173
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:58.909
And if you don't tell us
any specific package,

174
00:10:58.909 --> 00:11:02.535
like I could say right now,
just updated libxau6, right?

175
00:11:02.535 --> 00:11:05.447
And it would just update that package,
but if I don't tell it anything,

176
00:11:05.447 --> 00:11:07.036
it's just gonna go update all of them.

177
00:11:12.716 --> 00:11:15.083
So that'll take in to go,
and it'll go reinstall and

178
00:11:15.083 --> 00:11:17.298
update all of those various
different packages.

179
00:11:20.502 --> 00:11:27.200
And there's no reason that we need to
necessarily wait here for all of this.

180
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.614
Normally it goes faster though,
there you go.

181
00:11:34.971 --> 00:11:42.179
Well, one of the packages has a post
install script which is kind of fun.

182
00:11:42.179 --> 00:11:46.253
So let's just say keep the local
versions installed, I have no idea.

183
00:11:47.693 --> 00:11:51.479
It's doing some boot stuff upgrade.

184
00:11:51.479 --> 00:11:54.320
I probably should have paid a lot
more attention to what I just did.

185
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:59.560
But this is a local VM that I'm gonna blow
up at the end of this, so I don't care.

186
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:03.772
I probably just upset
some sysadmin somewhere.

187
00:12:03.772 --> 00:12:10.625
Some dark cave somewhere they crawl
down and say, why didn't you do that?

188
00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:16.900
Okay and then the last thing I wanted
to show you is sudo apt full upgrade.

189
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.480
And this is just gonna do those
previous two commands that I showed you

190
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.852
together with the auto remove and
the upgrade at the same time.

191
00:12:21.852 --> 00:12:23.881
It's just going to go do everything for
you.

192
00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:26.741
Since I already ran both of them,
it's gonna, it should have nothing to do,

193
00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:27.490
which it doesn't.

194
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.370
But that's another good thing to
do when you first start something.

195
00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.765
Do a full upgrade,
get everything up to date.

196
00:12:35.926 --> 00:12:38.373
Make sense?
Good so far.

197
00:12:38.373 --> 00:12:41.895
The one thing I was gonna show
you from the class notes.

198
00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:48.287
When I come back in here,
close my dev tools and here in,

199
00:12:48.287 --> 00:12:53.592
package management in
apt down at the bottom.

200
00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:56.507
There's a link here.

201
00:12:56.507 --> 00:13:01.037
If I click on this,
It'll take you to apt-browse.org.

202
00:13:01.037 --> 00:13:05.489
There's no official website for the apt
registry but this will browse it for you.

203
00:13:05.489 --> 00:13:07.307
So if I put no Jason here,

204
00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:11.998
it'll show me everything that
matches that I can click on that.

205
00:13:11.998 --> 00:13:16.441
And this will just give me a bunch of
information about that node JS package.

206
00:13:16.441 --> 00:13:19.235
So if you wanna look at it, you wanna
see what files are coming with it.

207
00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:25.691
You can see a description where it's
coming from, those sorts of things.

208
00:13:25.691 --> 00:13:31.290
This is a good place to go check it out
really quick before you install it.
