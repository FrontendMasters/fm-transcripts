00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.553
Let's talk about arguments.

2
00:00:01.553 --> 00:00:05.893
So we're gonna go back
into our gen_files again.

3
00:00:05.893 --> 00:00:10.010
Let's say we wanna put the destination
to be something that the user can

4
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.978
input, right?

5
00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:13.550
Cuz right now it's just always
generating this temp file for us.

6
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.456
And it'd be better if the user could tell,

7
00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:19.783
I want those temporary
files to go to this place.

8
00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:24.709
So the way that we do that instead of
making destination equal to temp like

9
00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:29.340
this, what I'm gonna do here is
I'm gonna make this equal to $1.

10
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.373
And that's going to be the first
argument provided to it, right?

11
00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:37.641
Now keep in mind there actually is
a $0 but the $0 will be gen_files.

12
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.791
It's gonna be the command that was run.

13
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:43.476
So if you wanna figure out how did
the user invoke this, which in our case,

14
00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.735
it would be obvious it would be gen files,
but

15
00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:48.073
you could do that with
$0 to figure that out.

16
00:00:48.073 --> 00:00:50.540
So $1 will be technically
the second thing, but

17
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.664
it's the first argument being provided.

18
00:00:52.664 --> 00:00:57.314
As you might imagine, $2 would be
the next one, $3, $4, and so on and so

19
00:00:57.314 --> 00:00:58.310
forth, right?

20
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.003
So $1 is gonna be equal to that.

21
00:01:04.268 --> 00:01:06.840
And now anywhere that we
refer to destination,

22
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.129
cuz we've basically renamed
$1 to be named destination.

23
00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.899
I totally could have renamed this
to be just $!, and $1 here, but

24
00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.070
I like giving names to my arguments so
I can figure out what that actually is.

25
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.670
It makes my bash script
a little bit more readable.

26
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.319
So I tend to do that, but
no reason you have to.

27
00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.013
So now I can do gen_files, and

28
00:01:28.013 --> 00:01:32.996
I can give it a yet-different-folder.

29
00:01:32.996 --> 00:01:36.786
And now let's see where am I?

30
00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:37.902
I'm in primary right, so

31
00:01:37.902 --> 00:01:41.150
if I look in here there's a new folder
called yet-different-folder, and

32
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.925
if I go into yet-different-folder, you can
see I got all my temporary files, right?

33
00:01:44.925 --> 00:01:47.114
So that's how you give
arguments to your bash script.

34
00:01:50.535 --> 00:01:55.712
And now what I wanna do is I wanna go
back one, and I want to vi this again.

35
00:01:55.712 --> 00:02:00.034
Let's talk about how to receive
user input interactively.

36
00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:04.780
So the next thing I wanna do is
I'm going to delete this line here

37
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.404
called file prefix.

38
00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:09.528
And we're gonna use a command called read.

39
00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.517
So I'm gonna say read -p,

40
00:02:11.517 --> 00:02:16.543
-p as being the prompt that was like
what are you asking the user for?

41
00:02:16.543 --> 00:02:19.964
I'm gonna say enter a file prefix.

42
00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:23.284
So we can ask these are the question
please enter something, and

43
00:02:23.284 --> 00:02:26.063
we're gonna store in
a variable called file prefix.

44
00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:31.606
Okay, so if I right and quit that,
this is the line that we added here.

45
00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:34.111
Everything else will still
work the way we anticipated,

46
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:37.358
cuz we call it file prefix and
we're referring to file prefix down there.

47
00:02:37.358 --> 00:02:42.007
So now I'm gonna say right quit,
and I'm gonna run gen_files, and

48
00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:45.631
I'm gonna put that in
a still-different-folder.

49
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:48.030
So a new folder called still-different,
and

50
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.501
it's gonna ask you please
enter a file prefix.

51
00:02:50.501 --> 00:02:54.129
I'm going to call this frontendmasters.

52
00:02:57.447 --> 00:02:59.148
Okay, and if I hit Enter, it'll say done.

53
00:02:59.148 --> 00:03:03.466
And if I go into still-different-folder,
and we look all the files are called

54
00:03:03.466 --> 00:03:07.147
frontendmasters1, frontendmasters2,
frontendmasters3.

55
00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:10.791
So that's how you grab user input
is using that read Command.

56
00:03:10.791 --> 00:03:14.508
So basically you're saying like,
wait for the user to enter something.

57
00:03:14.508 --> 00:03:19.338
As soon as they hit Enter, then continue,
and this will be whatever the user gave.
