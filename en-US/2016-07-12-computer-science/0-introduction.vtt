[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:42.724
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I'm Brian Holt,
been a web developer professionally for

3
00:00:42.724 --> 00:00:45.170
about five to six years now.

4
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.539
Previous is at Reddit up until
about 18 months ago Recently

5
00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.060
relocated to San Francisco
from Salt Lake City.

6
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.647
Everyone here in Minnesota
knows what it means to be cold,

7
00:00:58.647 --> 00:01:02.489
so I eventually escaped that and
got to San Francisco.

8
00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.230
But yep, now working at Netflix,
super fun.

9
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.435
I work on the non-member experience,
which is

10
00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.030
like every time you log in to Netflix or
manage your account, I do all that stuff.

11
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.630
Or I'm on the team of people that
does that stuff, I should say.

12
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.730
If you haven't already,
please open this link.

13
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.870
The other disclaimer is
I'm a little congested,

14
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.450
so if I sound that way, it's because I am.

15
00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.960
So yes, please open this,
it's just gonna take you to this web page.

16
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.240
You can also just open that URL,

17
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.950
this just seemed a little
bit easier to type up there.

18
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.130
Cool, and this is meant to be
an interactive workshop so

19
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.170
those of you who have questions,
please ask them as you have them.

20
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.160
Just raise your head and I'll tell
you to shut up or to ask a question,

21
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.380
one of the two.

22
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.470
And then for those you that
eventually watch this later,

23
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.520
feel free to ask me on Twitter,
send me an email, all that kind of stuff.

24
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.550
I'm always available to answer questions,
cool.

25
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.049
Well, let's get going.

26
00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.450
Clear that, okay, so
four semesters of computer science.

27
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.220
It's kind of an ambitious title, and
hopefully most of your bullshit detectors

28
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.612
are going off and saying like you
can't do four semesters in six hours.

29
00:02:16.612 --> 00:02:18.920
Well, first of all,
we're gonna do four semesters and

30
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.540
the other thing is we aren't gonna do six
hours, it'll probably longer than that.

31
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.550
So lies on both accounts, but hopefully we
can still get something useful for you.

32
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.320
Why I wrote this workshop.

33
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.950
I wrote it because I'm super frustrated.

34
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.980
I mean, I originally wrote it cuz I'm
frustrated with the interview process for

35
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.220
becoming an engineer.

36
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.200
They ask a lot of these stupid,
super algorithmic questions that, for

37
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.310
the most part, don't really apply
to most of your day to day work.

38
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.160
I mean we asked some of them at Netflix
because it actually does apply to

39
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.270
some of the stuff we do at Netflix,

40
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.910
like to receive graph is
super important at Netflix.

41
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.930
But, for example, what I did Reddit,

42
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.130
a lot of the stuff had absolutely
zero to do with what I was doing, and

43
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.770
yet that was one of the questions
they asked in my interview process.

44
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.938
So all that to say this class
is to help you prepare for

45
00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:09.540
those kind of terrible interviews [LAUGH].

46
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.930
Beyond that, I think these are useful

47
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.040
concepts to know because computer
science is a science of tradeoffs.

48
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.810
That's obviously an oversimplification,
but

49
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.180
I also think that generally holds true
that, should I have more readable code?

50
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.050
Should it go faster?

51
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.070
Should it take less memory?

52
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.960
Well, the answer to that question
is it totally depends on what

53
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.510
you're doing, right?

54
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:38.470
I'm gonna say 90% of the time, 95% of the
time, it should be the most readable code.

55
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.260
One of my personal code heroes,
who's taught here multiple times,

56
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.840
Kyle Simpson, said that code is more for

57
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.530
the person that has to maintain it
than it is for the computer, right?

58
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.870
It's more communication for
the person that comes after you,

59
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.050
whether that's you yourself later or
someone else.

60
00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.588
And so I think always err on
the side of more readable code.

61
00:03:57.588 --> 00:04:01.480
And then today we're gonna talk about
how to not write readable code, right?

62
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.190
Because algorithms get
to be kind of crazy.

63
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.490
So all that to say is this is useful

64
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.290
to help you kinda make tradeoffs in your
head when you start going through writing

65
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.220
really complicated things, things that
need to go faster, that sort of thing.

66
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.990
So again, this is a bit of disservice
to professors out there that

67
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.370
do actually teach real
computer science courses.

68
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.700
This is not actually four semesters but

69
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.840
that is before I dropped
out of college [LAUGH].

70
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.707
So I should add that disclaimer as well,
is that I did drop out of college.

71
00:04:37.707 --> 00:04:42.200
But I got enough computer science to be
able to teach this course, so don't worry.

72
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.508
These are the things I learned in my first
four semesters of computer science, so

73
00:04:45.508 --> 00:04:47.321
that's where the title comes from as well.

74
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:52.910
But it is total clickbait,
right there, clickbait title.

75
00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.680
This class is most helpful if
you already know JavaScript.

76
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.671
But we are gonna talk about some ES6
things, cuz I think they're fun and

77
00:04:58.671 --> 00:05:01.500
I will just kind of briefly
touch on what those are.

78
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.710
This class is not about ES6.

79
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.720
You should watch one of Front End Masters
other very wonderful courses on the ES6.

80
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.790
But I will briefly explain whatever
ES6 concepts I do touch on.

81
00:05:14.123 --> 00:05:19.150
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And lastly,
you should just read this book.

82
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.170
Corman's Intro to Algorithms, that's hard
to read but the link's on the website so.

83
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.740
It's free, it's on MIT's website,
you can get a PDF of it.

84
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.032
It's huge, by the way, do not download
it on Front End Masters' wifi, cuz, or

85
00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:35.070
else our class is gonna be really sad.

86
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.320
It's just one of those things
that it's long, it's kind of dry.

87
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.030
It's a textbook dry but just read it.

88
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.100
I swear, if you read that just once,
it's gonna serve you your entire career.

89
00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.540
It's gonna make you a better developer.

90
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.760
You just have to pay the tax and
do it once.

91
00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.488
I've read it a couple times, not recently,
so I probably should do it again.

92
00:05:56.488 --> 00:06:01.207
But it's gonna basically, for a frontend
developer today, that's gonna be way more

93
00:06:01.207 --> 00:06:05.880
knowledge than you're actually even gonna
need, but it's gonna be super helpful.

94
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.030
But this is a good place to start.

95
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.790
This is gonna show you that the mental
gymnastics of algorithms, I think's fun.

96
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.000
It's fun to reason through these.

97
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.867
They're puzzles, right?

98
00:06:16.867 --> 00:06:21.492
I'm asking you to rearrange numbers in
interesting ways and it's kind of like

99
00:06:21.492 --> 00:06:25.430
some sort of a really bad crossword
puzzle or something like that.
