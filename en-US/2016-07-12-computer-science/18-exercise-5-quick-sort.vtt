2
00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:06.196
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So I'd recommend
while you're doing the exercise just

3
00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:07.730
keep this up.

4
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.370
All the logic that you
need exists right here.

5
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.780
And just so you know, we saw how
much code it took to do merge sort,

6
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.760
that's about half as much code
to do Quicksort, just FYI.

7
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.099
And it's probably gonna
be done in one function.

8
00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.040
I did it all in one function so

9
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.550
I imagine you're going to
do it all one function too.

10
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.914
Okay, so go ahead and open your exercise.

11
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:31.937
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Like that.

12
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.270
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Again, no visualization
helper here, unfortunately.

13
00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:45.443
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And this is just gonna
kind of recap to you what Quickssort is.

14
00:00:45.443 --> 00:00:49.074
Please use xdescribe or
else you're gonna have a bad day.

15
00:00:49.074 --> 00:00:51.669
Or at least crash tabs.

16
00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:53.485
And we'll give you another
20 minutes to do this.
