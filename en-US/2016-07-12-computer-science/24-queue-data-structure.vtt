[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:06.350
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So you can't talk about
a stack without talking about queue,

3
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.900
I believe that's legally required.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:17.074
A stack is, I always get mess ups,
I always checked last in first out.

5
00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:19.437
A queue is first in, first out.

6
00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:22.975
So a queue is just a line for any of
you that don't speak British like it's

7
00:00:22.975 --> 00:00:26.977
literally, like you stand in line and then
the person has been in line longest gets

8
00:00:26.977 --> 00:00:29.472
out of the line right that,
that makes sense to us.

9
00:00:29.472 --> 00:00:35.458
It's fair.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah,

10
00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:36.950
similar to people queuing online.

11
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.591
It has methods called enqueue and
then it has a method called dequeue,

12
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:45.292
which basically enqueue adds
something to the array and

13
00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:50.713
then dequeue take something off the front.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH]

14
00:00:50.713 --> 00:00:51.879
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So unlike stack,

15
00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.704
you can also peak to see the next
thing coming off usually.

16
00:00:55.704 --> 00:00:57.388
So queues are useful for
other programming things.

17
00:00:57.388 --> 00:01:00.654
Obviously, not programming languages,
because that'd be weird.

18
00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:04.438
But let's say,
you needed to print something.

19
00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:05.792
That's usually done in a queue.

20
00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:09.032
If I added it first to the printer,
I should have first rights to do it.

21
00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:13.043
And if a bunch of us add things to the
printer, we don't want it to be last in,

22
00:01:13.043 --> 00:01:14.126
first out, right?

23
00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:17.959
Otherwise, everyone would be waiting until
someone was about ready to print and

24
00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.942
then was like, no, I'm gonna print it.

25
00:01:19.942 --> 00:01:25.045
That would be terrible, because then you
would never be able to print anything.

26
00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:28.208
Otherwise, Janice from accounting is going
to be printing all of her documents before

27
00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:29.129
you can print anything.

28
00:01:29.129 --> 00:01:30.983
Does anyone watch John Oliver?

29
00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:33.471
I do,
cuz Janice from accounting don't give up.

30
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.637
Yeah, [LAUGH] that's
what that's referring to.

31
00:01:37.637 --> 00:01:42.373
This also priority queues and this
should be something more like networking

32
00:01:42.373 --> 00:01:47.186
where you have some packets are way
more important than other packets right.

33
00:01:47.186 --> 00:01:49.722
And so, they need to be pushed
to the front of the queue.

34
00:01:49.722 --> 00:01:52.629
So my classic example,
cuz I worked in ethics is streaming video.

35
00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:55.545
You want those streaming video
packets to be highly prioritized.

36
00:01:55.545 --> 00:01:58.892
Because if you start skipping
packets when you're streaming video,

37
00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:02.524
you start skipping frames and everyone's
really sad and then you call me and

38
00:02:02.524 --> 00:02:04.528
you even get mad at me and everyone cries.

39
00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:08.094
So you want those streaming video packets
be way higher priority than your Dropbox

40
00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.534
ones, cuz your Dropbox ones
can just happen whenever.

41
00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:12.615
It needs to sync sometime.

42
00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:16.217
It can be later, but I need to
watch my House of Cards right now.

43
00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:17.615
That's what a priority queue is.

44
00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:22.292
So basically, you give it a priority and
things with higher priorities go towards

45
00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:26.019
the front of the queue and
then things with lower lower priority go

46
00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.986
to the back of the queue and
that's the idea behind a priority queue.

47
00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:33.925
So where those can get a little bit hairy
sometimes is if you have a lot of higher

48
00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:37.803
priority traffic and you have things
that are in your low priority traffic,

49
00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:39.996
that stuff actually might never get done.

50
00:02:39.996 --> 00:02:42.572
You might never run out of
high-priority things to do.

51
00:02:42.572 --> 00:02:45.846
So sometimes you have to have some sort of
algorithm that's going through and say,

52
00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:48.791
okay, this has been in here long enough
that I'm gonna start bumping up its

53
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:50.795
priority until eventually
it's gonna get done.

54
00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:54.862
Maybe.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: They have their own

55
00:02:54.862 --> 00:03:00.444
problems, just like everything.
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So,

56
00:03:00.444 --> 00:03:03.038
that's it for interfaces.

57
00:03:03.038 --> 00:03:05.084
Any questions about
interfaces before we move

58
00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:09.930
on?
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: It's just useful computer

59
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.040
science knowledge to have, cuz people will
say these things and just expect you.

60
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.360
Already know what that is,
which is frustrating.

61
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.910
So hopefully,
that adds some more tools to your toolbox.
