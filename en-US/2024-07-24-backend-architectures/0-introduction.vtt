00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.692
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: Welcome everybody
to introduction to systems design,

2
00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:05.582
focusing on architecture.

3
00:00:05.582 --> 00:00:10.695
This course is primarily focused on
teaching and educating about architectural

4
00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:15.356
backend system principles,
challenges, real-world applications,

5
00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:20.183
while offering a detailed understanding
of when and how to implement them.

6
00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:23.013
There's gonna be a lot of things
that we talk about in this course.

7
00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:27.734
The main thing I want you to be able to
take away as a developer is to be able to

8
00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:32.699
feel empowered on when and how to make
backend system architecture designs.

9
00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.270
If you've ever felt like you've ever
been curious or ever wanted to build

10
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.137
larger scale systems, or build appropriate
systems for specific problems,

11
00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:46.211
that's really a big part of this
course and walking away from it.

12
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:48.810
Before we get started,
I'd like to introduce myself.

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.798
Hello, my name is Eric Reinert, also
known as Blackglasses on the interwebs.

14
00:00:53.798 --> 00:00:55.409
I'm a senior software engineer.

15
00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.434
I work at a company called Hippo
where I do a lot of the practices and

16
00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:01.737
methodologies that we're gonna be
talking about in the course today.

17
00:01:01.737 --> 00:01:03.122
I'm also a content creator.

18
00:01:03.122 --> 00:01:07.633
I stream and make videos on Twitch and
YouTube under the Alt-F4 Stream.

19
00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.077
I'm a diagram and flowchart artist.

20
00:01:10.077 --> 00:01:13.113
I really enjoy building diagrams and
flowcharts and

21
00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:17.814
taking my mental images of how I wanna
build something and putting them to paper.

22
00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:22.725
And I'm also a habitual problem solver, I
really like putting myself into situations

23
00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:25.224
and trying to solve
problems the best I can.

24
00:01:25.224 --> 00:01:27.195
Learning through that experience and

25
00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:30.034
it's been a big part of how
I've grown as a developer.

26
00:01:30.034 --> 00:01:33.802
If you're curious about finding any of
the content I created on the internet,

27
00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:36.607
I've got a few links here that
you might be interested in.

28
00:01:36.607 --> 00:01:38.355
First off is the Engineering Blog.

29
00:01:38.355 --> 00:01:40.553
I have a company called Alt 4 LLC and

30
00:01:40.553 --> 00:01:44.155
we build content creator tools
as well as other software.

31
00:01:44.155 --> 00:01:48.571
And a big focus of this blog is to try and
educate people and how we do things and

32
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:50.572
how we tackle specific problems.

33
00:01:50.572 --> 00:01:54.506
It's updated often and so if you're ever
curious about how we solve problems as

34
00:01:54.506 --> 00:01:56.338
a company, it's a great resource.

35
00:01:56.338 --> 00:01:58.821
I also stream on Twitch as I mentioned,

36
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:02.822
twitchtv/thealt4stream my
stream weekdays and weekends.

37
00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.082
So if you're ever curious about any of
the stuff I'm working on or you wanna

38
00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:09.529
learn more about what I'm doing, you
should always hop in chat and say hello.

39
00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:12.394
I'm also on Twitter,
although I don't really call it X.

40
00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:16.202
I do tweet on Twitter, so if you're ever
curious about what I'm doing or again,

41
00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:19.064
any of the projects I'm working on,
you can check that out.

42
00:02:19.064 --> 00:02:22.933
As well as YouTube, where I upload a lot
of videos about things that I'm working on

43
00:02:22.933 --> 00:02:25.470
and projects I have interest in and
things like that.

44
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.477
To give you a little bit of background of
where I started and where I've come from.

45
00:02:29.477 --> 00:02:32.012
I first started my career with frontend.

46
00:02:32.012 --> 00:02:35.717
I started doing that for about two and
a half years at a company called

47
00:02:35.717 --> 00:02:39.684
Media Temple, where I was heavily
focused in building PHP frontends and

48
00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:41.391
slowly moving to JavaScript.

49
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:45.038
This was a time when React was
kinda just coming out, and so

50
00:02:45.038 --> 00:02:49.805
I was a part of that transition from
moving backend frontends to fully client

51
00:02:49.805 --> 00:02:51.758
based JavaScript frontends.

52
00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:56.368
A big part of what I do and
my interests and how I kind of follow my

53
00:02:56.368 --> 00:03:00.911
career path is also that I'm
really driven by my curiosity.

54
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.052
And so after I did frontend for a few
years, I found myself wanting to take new

55
00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:08.566
steps into different parts of
the software development stack.

56
00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:10.059
And one of those was backend,

57
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:12.997
which is a lot of what we're
gonna be talking about today.

58
00:03:12.997 --> 00:03:16.369
I spent about two and
a half years working on backend systems.

59
00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:20.820
I worked at a company that was a startup
where I was really in charge of building

60
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.792
a lot of those systems and working
with a lot of different new things,

61
00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:28.031
like geolocation and hailing and
all this kinda stuff.

62
00:03:28.031 --> 00:03:31.028
After working in backend for
two and a half years, again,

63
00:03:31.028 --> 00:03:34.037
I wanted to follow my curiosity
with a lot of my interests.

64
00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:37.587
And one of that interests was saying,
okay, I've worked in frontend.

65
00:03:37.587 --> 00:03:40.886
I've worked in backend, now I'd like to
know what it's like doing full stack.

66
00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:44.137
I spent two and
a half years doing that as well.

67
00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:48.806
I worked at another startup where I had a
lot of responsibilities around prototyping

68
00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:51.697
and building out new systems to try and
be as agile and

69
00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:54.806
quick as we possibly could
to deliver things to market.

70
00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:56.566
So I had a lot of experience and

71
00:03:56.566 --> 00:04:00.164
got a lot of experience with
understanding how to move fast.

72
00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:04.578
Understanding how to build small
systems and large systems.

73
00:04:04.578 --> 00:04:09.379
And that again led me towards the next
phase of my career which was,

74
00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.467
I'd like to really learn and
own this as more of a high level engineer.

75
00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:17.036
And so
after I left the full stack position,

76
00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:21.620
I started actually leaning more towards,
DevOps and Platform Engineering,

77
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.965
which I've been doing for
the last four and a half years.

78
00:04:24.965 --> 00:04:29.863
My current job is heavily focused on a lot
of those challenges, whether it be how

79
00:04:29.863 --> 00:04:34.853
do we improve developer flows, how do we
build new systems that developers use.

80
00:04:34.853 --> 00:04:38.278
As well as how do we build new
systems that users use and

81
00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:41.868
how do we join those together
in a cohesive experience.

82
00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:45.370
And that really brought me
to even where I am today,

83
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.094
where I slowly stepped away from
implementation and writing code and

84
00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:54.756
become much more passionate about
developing the architectures.

85
00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:58.532
The systems, the scalability of the
systems, the robustness of them, which is

86
00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:01.990
really what brings us to the course
that we're gonna be going over today.

87
00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:06.501
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: I do have two
existing courses on Frontend Masters,

88
00:05:06.501 --> 00:05:07.524
if you are curious.

89
00:05:07.524 --> 00:05:11.710
And what's really great about these
courses is they're all kind of themed

90
00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.510
around a lot of the same things.

91
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.174
The first course is an introduction
to DevOps for developers,

92
00:05:17.174 --> 00:05:21.046
where I talk about taking your
first steps into DevOps basically,

93
00:05:21.046 --> 00:05:23.132
from a perspective of a developer.

94
00:05:23.132 --> 00:05:28.357
DevOps is a really thrown around word,
and it's kind of not really well defined.

95
00:05:28.357 --> 00:05:31.787
And my goal in this course was
really to help you walk away,

96
00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:35.220
understanding what DevOps
actually means for a company.

97
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.025
How to use these practices and principles
to help grow the developer experience as

98
00:05:40.025 --> 00:05:42.820
well as internal systems and
things like that.

99
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.658
And a lot of that course should
help you understand how you define

100
00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:47.946
DevOps at a company.

101
00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.753
I also have a course called
enterprise cloud infrastructure.

102
00:05:50.753 --> 00:05:54.317
Again, I try and really work and
educate around the things that I know.

103
00:05:54.317 --> 00:05:58.254
That's where I feel like I have
most of my confidence, and so

104
00:05:58.254 --> 00:06:03.040
enterprise cloud infrastructure was
really the next step for my career,

105
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.150
which was learning how to use DevOps and
use it at a large scale.

106
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.661
Learning how to do things like set
up large scale systems with GitOps,

107
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:16.939
optimizing CI/CD workflows, standardizing
strategies for an organization,

108
00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:21.770
and how to handle, cloud resource
management and other things like that.

109
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.355
And I think if you're
interested in more of a scale,

110
00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:29.795
you wanna learn how to take a company and

111
00:06:29.795 --> 00:06:34.815
grow it to a much higher
automated process based system.

112
00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:38.365
Enterprise cloud infrastructure's
a really great course for that and

113
00:06:38.365 --> 00:06:41.509
it should be something that you
can take to almost any company.

114
00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:45.676
And be confident that you can grow that
company to the scale that it needs.

115
00:06:45.676 --> 00:06:50.530
So the first goal of this course is to
define what backend system architecture

116
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.435
designs are.

117
00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:57.965
How you're gonna build something if you
don't fully know what something is?

118
00:06:57.965 --> 00:07:02.665
And so the first thing I wanna be able to
do is help you define what these things

119
00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:04.514
are and what these tools are.

120
00:07:04.514 --> 00:07:05.275
From there,

121
00:07:05.275 --> 00:07:09.571
I wanna help you define when to use
backend system architecture designs.

122
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:14.503
There are situations where you might be in
a circumstance where you do need to create

123
00:07:14.503 --> 00:07:18.591
designs for a specific problem that
a company might need to solve, or

124
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:21.571
a specific challenge
that you're dealing with.

125
00:07:21.571 --> 00:07:26.316
And so this section of the course should
help you understand when you should

126
00:07:26.316 --> 00:07:31.215
actually pull the trigger on completely
designing something from scratch,

127
00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:34.630
doing small iterative changes and
things like that.

128
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.976
After we define the what and the when,
we're gonna define the how, right?

129
00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:42.004
So now that you understand
what backend systems are, and

130
00:07:42.004 --> 00:07:44.477
now that you'll understand
when to use them.

131
00:07:44.477 --> 00:07:48.246
We'll show you how to implement
those backend systems, step-by-step

132
00:07:48.246 --> 00:07:52.328
considerations, things that you should
be thinking about, best practices.

133
00:07:52.328 --> 00:07:56.406
The goal here is that, this should help
you feel empowered to actually start

134
00:07:56.406 --> 00:08:00.307
taking the steps of solving the problems
you need to at an organization.

135
00:08:00.307 --> 00:08:04.736
There's also a second part of this course,
which is really focusing on exploring

136
00:08:04.736 --> 00:08:08.910
common backend system architecture
designs, things like microservices,

137
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.403
monoliths, serverless.

138
00:08:10.403 --> 00:08:13.689
These are all a lot of the things that
we're used to talking about today and

139
00:08:13.689 --> 00:08:15.229
that are growing in our industry.

140
00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:19.024
And so I help you understand what
these are and how they're useful.

141
00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:20.495
At the end of the course,

142
00:08:20.495 --> 00:08:24.499
we also showcase the evolution of
a backend systems architecture.

143
00:08:24.499 --> 00:08:29.005
So we talk about where most systems
normally start whether it be from

144
00:08:29.005 --> 00:08:33.830
a modelist or a service perspective
to moving to servers or serverless,

145
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.325
or vice versa moving backwards,
moving forwards.

146
00:08:37.325 --> 00:08:42.263
The idea is just to kinda show you
that this is a fluid evolution that

147
00:08:42.263 --> 00:08:44.567
happens over a period of time.

148
00:08:44.567 --> 00:08:47.809
It's not just a designated
step-by-step-by-step, but

149
00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:51.982
it's really about use case of starting
from one, growing to another, and then

150
00:08:51.982 --> 00:08:56.300
growing even further as the company grows
and the requirements for that company.

151
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.753
Are there pre-requisites for the course?

152
00:08:58.753 --> 00:09:01.441
There aren't many, but
I do think that it would help to

153
00:09:01.441 --> 00:09:04.141
have a basic understanding
of software development.

154
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:06.874
If you've never built software before or
anything like that,

155
00:09:06.874 --> 00:09:10.130
this might be a little difficult for
you because a lot of this is high level.

156
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:11.997
A lot of this is conceptual and

157
00:09:11.997 --> 00:09:16.342
kinda helps you get you in the mindset
of how to solve these problems.

158
00:09:16.342 --> 00:09:18.942
So if you have a good understanding
of software development,

159
00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:20.147
that'll definitely help.

160
00:09:20.147 --> 00:09:23.887
On top of that, a basic understanding
