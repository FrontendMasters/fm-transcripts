00:00:00.106 --> 00:00:02.756
&gt;&gt; Erik Reinert: So we've talked about
this one a little bit technology

2
00:00:02.756 --> 00:00:03.682
choices, right?

3
00:00:03.682 --> 00:00:06.586
Choosing the right technology stack for
the system is crucial and

4
00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:07.438
can be difficult.

5
00:00:07.438 --> 00:00:11.233
I think this is definitely something
that people deal with a lot, which is,

6
00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:13.743
how do I know the right technology to use,
right?

7
00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:18.143
And this even kinda goes
to your question earlier

8
00:00:18.143 --> 00:00:21.694
of how do you guide yourself to do that?

9
00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:28.667
I think partially it's understanding
as well as experimentation, right?

10
00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:32.357
If you've never used, one of the things
I say on my Twitch stream is,

11
00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:36.385
I'm never going to recommend you
something that I haven't built myself.

12
00:00:36.385 --> 00:00:40.419
And that's because I can't comment on
things I've never used in production or

13
00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:42.236
never have had experience around.

14
00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:47.547
And I think those technology choices are
important to to answering how you're gonna

15
00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:52.506
build something like I said earlier and
showing you the design of Kubernetes.

16
00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:56.755
I had really never used Kubernetes
even at that level before, and

17
00:00:56.755 --> 00:01:00.310
even taking on my own
serverless.g infrastructure,

18
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.118
on top of that, it was a lot, and
I didn't know how to troubleshoot that.

19
00:01:05.118 --> 00:01:06.662
I didn't know how to debug it.

20
00:01:06.662 --> 00:01:09.888
Again, new technologies are cool,
and they're really fun.

21
00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:12.751
But at the same time,
if you can't support it,

22
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:17.127
if you don't know how to handle things,
when things go a fire or a flame.

23
00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:21.893
Or whatever you wanna call it, it just
means that you're potentially putting

24
00:01:21.893 --> 00:01:24.214
yourself in a bad place in the future.

25
00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:28.573
And again, it's fun to do those for
projects you're working on the side, but

26
00:01:28.573 --> 00:01:33.197
you need to be a little bit more serious
about the technology choices you're making

27
00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:35.065
when bringing them to a company.

28
00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:37.895
Flashy things don't always
mean that it's good.

29
00:01:37.895 --> 00:01:41.897
Think about bugs and bug zappers.

30
00:01:41.897 --> 00:01:43.513
Resource Management.

31
00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:48.702
So a big thing about this is basically
are you allocating the right resources for

32
00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:51.579
the systems development and maintenance?

33
00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.634
And when we say resources,
we mean anything.

34
00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:57.919
I'm not talking about
just cloud resources.

35
00:01:57.919 --> 00:02:03.903
I'm talking about engineering resources,
engineering time, manager planning,

36
00:02:03.903 --> 00:02:09.316
things like that can be really important
to how much money you're spending.

37
00:02:09.316 --> 00:02:13.728
One of the biggest things that companies
do not consider when talking about

38
00:02:13.728 --> 00:02:17.803
technology is how many engineering
hours are going into something.

39
00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:21.961
That's just completely a black box to It's
like, well, we've already got them, but

40
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.421
it's like, well, okay, but

41
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:26.588
are you spending 900 hours at
a given time period on something?

42
00:02:26.588 --> 00:02:31.319
Well, no, nothing's free, and you just
spent a lot more probably in engineering

43
00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.443
hours than you would have on
the actual system itself.

44
00:02:34.443 --> 00:02:38.772
So resource management can be
really crucial with architectures.

45
00:02:38.772 --> 00:02:44.086
And then again,
the last one is stakeholder alignment.

46
00:02:44.086 --> 00:02:46.249
I've seen a lot of people try and

47
00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:51.381
make changes without getting stakeholders
opinions and then make fights or

48
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:56.206
make, let's just say challenging
discussions of why did you do this?

49
00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:57.762
Why did you make this change?

50
00:02:57.762 --> 00:02:59.626
What made you decide to do this?

51
00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:05.093
And again, as an engineer, that's kinda
where you failed, where you didn't go to

52
00:03:05.093 --> 00:03:10.727
all the people and share, well, okay, this
is how we're thinking about doing this.

53
00:03:10.727 --> 00:03:11.895
What do you think?

54
00:03:11.895 --> 00:03:15.911
Going back to culture and
documentation and things like that,

55
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:20.458
if you create that culture where
you're opening up a conversation with

56
00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:23.130
engineering managers, stakeholders.

57
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.858
They're gonna feel more comfortable in
the confidence with you as well in your

58
00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:27.770
decision making.

59
00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.627
So, it's good to get
stakeholder alignment and

60
00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:34.191
make sure that you're talking
to the right people who care.

61
00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:35.601
You don't wanna step on anyone's toes.

62
00:03:35.601 --> 00:03:41.433
And again, architecture design touches
a lot of different parts of the system.

63
00:03:41.433 --> 00:03:45.194
And so,
you don't wanna make anyone not like, for

64
00:03:45.194 --> 00:03:49.755
any reason potentially the kind
of approach you're taking.

65
00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.585
Unless, of course,
it's a valid reason [LAUGH].
