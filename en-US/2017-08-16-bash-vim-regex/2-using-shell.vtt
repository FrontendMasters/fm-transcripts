00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.460
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So now,
it's time to learn the command line.

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.280
We're gonna be using bash
which is a very popular shell.

3
00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.150
It's the default shell on a lot of
systems including Macros 10 and

4
00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.130
on Linux for interactive shells anyways.

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.540
So if you wanna try something,
if everyone could pop open a terminal and

6
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.420
type this, if you could type echo,
then space $,

7
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.480
and then all in caps, the word SHELL.

8
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.390
It should say something like /bin/bash,
or maybe you have another

9
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.320
kind of shell installed, but
it will read something like that.

10
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.566
So if I go ahead and do this,

11
00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:48.485
do echo $SHELL, I see /bin/bash.

12
00:00:50.746 --> 00:00:56.000
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So,
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Echo in this case

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.280
is a command and
the $SHELL is an example of an argument.

14
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.770
So you can have as many
other words as you want

15
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.860
that are to the right of the commands.

16
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.579
You see the different
kinds of arguments and

17
00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.660
they just kind of customize
how the command should work.

18
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.371
Maybe what kinds of files
it should operate on and

19
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.031
what it should generally do.

20
00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:22.507
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So
another fun command to try is the ls

21
00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:23.090
command, so this lets you list files.

22
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.699
So if I type ls,
I see everything in my home directory,

23
00:01:29.699 --> 00:01:35.465
some images and
some directories in this case.

24
00:01:43.358 --> 00:01:47.825
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: If we wanna provide
some arguments to the ls commands,

25
00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:49.240
ls expects.

26
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.740
If you give it different arguments,

27
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.420
those arguments are expected to be in
different locations that you wanna list.

28
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.240
So for example, I can do ls /,

29
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.160
that's gonna list all of
the files in the root directory.

30
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.960
Or I can do, if I wanna see
everything in my data directory,

31
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.490
I can ls data, and
I see everything in there.

32
00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:12.259
That's weird.

33
00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:16.541
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: There should
be a lot more files in there.

34
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:17.562
I'm gonna summon
the Raspberry Pi which I am.

35
00:02:17.562 --> 00:02:20.749
I forgot about that.

36
00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:24.123
[LAUGH] So there we go.

37
00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:25.870
Right, that's what I expected.

38
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.454
See, I didn't even know that I was on
a different system because they're so

39
00:02:29.454 --> 00:02:31.080
interoperable.

40
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.476
They're both Debian systems as well.

41
00:02:36.436 --> 00:02:42.530
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: There's another fun
command that you can try which is pwd.

42
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.600
This tells you kind of where
you are on your system.

43
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.670
So here I see that I'm in this directory,

44
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.544
in my home directory called
doc/workshop/mn/day1.

45
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.340
You can also change the directory
with the cd command.

46
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.620
So if I now go to, if I wanna go
up with directory, I can do cd..

47
00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.784
And I can also change into this directory,
day 1.

48
00:03:11.784 --> 00:03:17.020
So this is sort of navigating around if
you've used a graphical file explorer.

49
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.370
Going into directories and then going
back up to the parent directory again.

50
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.525
So if everyone could just take
a little bit of time to poke

51
00:03:28.525 --> 00:03:33.567
around with these commands which are cd,
ls,

52
00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:38.890
and pwd,
I think that would be pretty good to do.

53
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.608
And if you are already
familiar with these commands,

54
00:03:42.608 --> 00:03:46.916
maybe try using some of the other
switches to these commands.

55
00:03:46.916 --> 00:03:50.750
Which you can read about using
this command called man.

56
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.470
Tells you everything you
wanna know about any command.

57
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.250
So if you ever wanna read more about any
of these commands that we're gonna do,

58
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.220
you can usually type man space and
the command name.

59
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.180
And you can learn more about it.

60
00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.630
So there's all kind of fun options,
written by Richard Stallman and

61
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.470
David MacKenzie.

62
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.632
That's very interesting too.
