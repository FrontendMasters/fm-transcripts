00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.080
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: To do the same thing
in JavaScript you can use that row place.

2
00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.790
If you have node installed
you can type node

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.570
and then you can sort
of do dot replace and

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.620
replace the one with the word one, or

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.559
maybe we wanna replace any
number with the word, number.

6
00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:33.190
That also works, so
that can be a different number, like 1000.

7
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.610
Some examples for what these mean,

8
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.317
I'm gonna go a little bit more
into that in just a moment, so

9
00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:50.670
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Why don't we just well.

10
00:00:53.696 --> 00:00:56.424
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Yes, so, why don't
I just show few more of these and

11
00:00:56.424 --> 00:00:59.540
then we can experiment on
the command line just.

12
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.490
Trying some things with Node,
hopefully you will have that installed.

13
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.860
Also trying some things with sed,

14
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.330
and just piping output from
the echo command into sed.

15
00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.040
So here's a little program,
for example, that will match

16
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.640
on the first argument that's given,
which is process.argv(2).

17
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.640
So, this will match dash H and
dash dash help is what that means.

18
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.580
Print a message and

19
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.380
that's just an example as well of some
other things you might wanna see.
