00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.405
&gt;&gt; James: Okay, so hopefully by now
everyone has had a little bit of a chance

2
00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:11.064
to play around with moving around in
the directory structure of your system.

3
00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:14.770
Had a chance to use ls, and
pwd, and the cd commands.

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.790
And hopefully, also,

5
00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.060
all of you are following along with
the GitHub Notes that I put up.

6
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.220
So you can consult back to
everything that I've showed so far.

7
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.259
So some examples of poking
around on the directory.

8
00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.760
So an important thing on a Unix system
as well is these special directories.

9
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.000
Which include things like.

10
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790
And dot and tilde.

11
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.540
So, dot dot so means the parent directory.

12
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.250
So, you can put this kind of
anywhere in the path, like here.

13
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.090
I mean, this directory,
I can use "cg" space dot dot,

14
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.270
now I'm in the parent of that, I can
do it again, I'm in the parent of that,

15
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.574
or I can do something like cd ../..

16
00:01:06.574 --> 00:01:11.580
And now I'm gonna skip up two directories.

17
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.500
Can see what's there.

18
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.130
Or, maybe I want to cd ../../../ and

19
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.810
then go into another directory.

20
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.593
I can also do that.

21
00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:27.845
&gt;&gt; James: And now I'm somewhere else.

22
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.200
&gt;&gt; James: So another important thing
is dot, which you sometimes need.

23
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.070
For example, if you have a command in
the current directory that you wanna run,

24
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.470
then you've gotta do ./ because

25
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.350
otherwise commands have to be in your
path, which we'll talk about later.

26
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.428
Also, you can put a ./ anywhere
in a path and it does nothing,

27
00:01:57.428 --> 00:02:04.930
so for example if I use the Head
command which I'll talk about later.

28
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.477
I can do ././././././unix.md which is

29
00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:18.940
the same as doing just unix.md because
./ means the current directory.

30
00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.440
So it's like a little cycle
that points back to itself.

31
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.950
Another important thing to know about is
tilde which means your home directory.

32
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.670
So if I type cd ~,
I'm gonna go to my home directory.

33
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.150
There we are.

34
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.530
You can also navigate around
from your home directory.

35
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.479
So if I go to cd ~/media/music/vaporwave,

36
00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.310
my vaporwave directory.

37
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.700
I can also go to, if I want to edit

38
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.870
a file without having to cd into that
directory you can pass in the full path.

39
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.540
So can edit my bashrc file, like this.

40
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.530
That's what tilde means.

41
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.630
Some more examples of that.

42
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.770
Another fun command that you can use to
experiment and play around with dot, and

43
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:25.370
dot dot, and tilde,
is the cat command, yes.

44
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.650
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Did you cover pwd so
people are going around everywhere?

45
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:31.290
&gt;&gt; James: Yeah we did.

46
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.920
We covered cdpwt and ls.

47
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.650
That's sure.

48
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.370
Also another fun thing about cd is if
you get lost somewhere in the directory

49
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.890
structure and you don't know
where you are you can type cd and

50
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.770
it puts you back in your home directory.

51
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.089
So it's the same thing as doing cd ~.
