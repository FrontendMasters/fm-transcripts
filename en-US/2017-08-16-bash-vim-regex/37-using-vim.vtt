00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.260
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Let's learn Vim.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.030
So if you don't already
have Vim installed,

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.100
the problem we have at least vi installed.

4
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.450
If you don't have Vim installed,
go ahead and install it.

5
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.190
Also, on some systems, you'll have to
install things like syntax highlighting

6
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.600
and all of the fancy features.

7
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.740
With a package, on a Linux system called
vim-common, so it's good to have that.

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.700
If you're on a Mac, I think that
you're probably already good to go.

9
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.522
So why doesn't everybody type vim?

10
00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:34.202
Should see something like this.

11
00:00:36.827 --> 00:00:41.280
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: I have
version 7.4 on debian.

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.700
So if you try to type,
this is what happens.

13
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.870
It might take a bit for
it to start logging.

14
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.950
This is because when you go into vi,

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.700
you actually start out in this
thing called command mode.

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.020
So to go into insert mode, which is a more
familiar kind of editing, you can type i.

17
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.950
So then at the bottom,
it shows INSERT with dashes around it.

18
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.100
And now you can type
basically like normal.

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.090
You can even use the arrow keys and
things like that.

20
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.201
But I'll show you a better way
of doing that in a moment.

21
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:18.414
So you can say, hello

22
00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:23.570
there I am in Insert mode.

23
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.520
So if we wanna save this file,
we're gonna have to give it a file name,

24
00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.690
because we just started
them without a file name.

25
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.060
So to do that,
we have to go back into command mode,

26
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.089
which you can do by hitting Escape.

27
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.292
Or you can actually do
it with Ctrl+C as well,

28
00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:43.228
which is useful if you don't wanna
reach all the way up to Escape.

29
00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:46.224
Although, in my system,
I have CapsLock mapped to Escape,

30
00:01:46.224 --> 00:01:47.860
because I use Vim all the time.

31
00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.270
So it's very easy for me to hit Escape.

32
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.780
Anyways, once you're in command mode,
you do colon and

33
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.619
then you can do w space the name of
the file that you wanna save as.

34
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:07.993
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So I'll save it as
hello., or I'll save it as wow.txt.

35
00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:08.493
There we go.

36
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.330
And you should see a little message
at the bottom similar to that.

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.279
If you wanna quit now that we've
saved our file, you can do,

38
00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:22.317
in command mode which you can
always get to by hitting Escape.

39
00:02:22.317 --> 00:02:27.060
You can do :q and that exits.

40
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.732
If you want to now open that file again,
you can do vi or vim,

41
00:02:33.732 --> 00:02:38.810
the name of the file and
you can make a change.

42
00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:45.017
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: If you
wanna do both saving and

43
00:02:45.017 --> 00:02:50.339
quitting in one operation you can kind
of combine those commands by doing

44
00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:56.350
:wq,
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Which saves and quits.

45
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.530
If you want to do things like,
maybe you made some changes.

46
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.220
Maybe your cat walked on your keyboard and
put a bunch of characters in your program.

47
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.090
I have a cat now that does that a lot.

48
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.420
It loves to stand on my keyboard.

49
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.950
If you just wanna quit
without saving the changes,

50
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.160
if you try to do :q, vim will tell you
you haven't written your changes out.

51
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:31.290
So you have to tell vim explicitly,
:q!, which is, I just wanna quit.

52
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.970
I don't care about the changes,
throw them away, which it does.

53
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.618
Now, if I open it agin see
that those changes are done.

54
00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:46.850
So to recap,
insert mode you can go into by hitting i.

55
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.470
There are different ways that
I'll go into that you can

56
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.450
go into insert mode with variations.

57
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.136
But i to go into insert mode, Escape to go
from insert mode back into command mode.

58
00:03:58.136 --> 00:04:03.270
In command mode, :q quits, :w writes.

59
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.780
Also, if you make a change, you can do :w.

60
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.280
If you've already specified a file name,

61
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.130
then you don't have to
specify the file name again.

62
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.749
So saves to the same file.

63
00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:19.418
And :wq writes and quits, :q quits.

64
00:04:19.418 --> 00:04:24.360
:q!, quits discarding changes.

65
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.060
Also if you've typed vim already and
you wanna load a file that already exists,

66
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.180
you can do :o and the name of that file.

67
00:04:33.487 --> 00:04:33.987
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: There we are.

68
00:04:38.617 --> 00:04:39.117
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Yep.
