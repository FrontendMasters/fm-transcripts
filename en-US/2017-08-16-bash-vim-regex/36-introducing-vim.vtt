00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.390
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Let's
start in on the Vim topic.

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.480
If you're working on UNIX systems,

3
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.980
there's kind of no way of
getting around Vim or VI.

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.377
Vim is a kind of new editor, new being,

5
00:00:17.377 --> 00:00:21.120
maybe let's see, how old is Vim?

6
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.640
So Vim is only 24 years old,
it's very new.

7
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.950
It's based on an older editor
from the 80s called VI.

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.210
I think the first version
was made by Bill Joy,

9
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.270
who's one of the people who
started Sun Microsystems.

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.690
Also one of the people who is behind BSD,
just kind of Unix.

11
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.620
And we're gonna be
playing around with Vim.

12
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.110
So it's very important when you're
starting out to find a cheat sheet.

13
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.610
So there's a couple of examples.

14
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.940
I'm gonna paste those into the chat.

15
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.195
I'll go ahead and open them up
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: And

16
00:01:06.195 --> 00:01:12.910
Vim is also like Rajax/g] kind
of its own little language.

17
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.910
So it might be a bit strange to think of
a text editor as being a language, but

18
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.630
this let's you be very efficient
in kind of making edits to files.

19
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.640
And kind of cutting things
up to a character and

20
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.940
then putting them somewhere else, and you
can sort of compose all of these different

21
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.680
things you learned in kind of
novel ways which I really like.

22
00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.083
I've been a Vim user for a very long time,
and I do this stuff constantly.

23
00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:50.856
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: You might have to use
Vim [LAUGH] if you need to edit config

24
00:01:50.856 --> 00:01:55.820
files and things because pretty much any
Unix system you're gonna run into has it

25
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.730
already installed.

26
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.610
If it doesn't have Vim,

27
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.520
then it's gonna have VI which is sort
of like a reduced subset of Vim.

28
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.919
If your SSH'ed into a server, it's not
like you can open up sublime text or

29
00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.647
whatever graphical editor
du jour is popular.

30
00:02:16.647 --> 00:02:19.550
Also maybe you're on
a constrained environment that

31
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.870
couldn't even load that kind of program
cuz it just doesn't have enough memory,

32
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.000
maybe it's a wireless router or
something like that.

33
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.180
Although I don't think wireless
routers typically have VI, but

34
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.995
sometimes they have ED, which is
also one of Vim's VI ancestors, but

35
00:02:35.995 --> 00:02:45.170
ED is a very [LAUGH] strange editor that
you probably won't have to use ever.

36
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.383
But the main feature, I think, for

37
00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:52.883
using Vim is it's really good for
programming and

38
00:02:52.883 --> 00:02:57.935
it's really good for
being really fast editing files.

39
00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:06.183
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So what makes Vim a
good editor for doing computer programming

40
00:03:06.183 --> 00:03:10.782
is it has a lot of features like
indentation this kinda stuff,

41
00:03:10.782 --> 00:03:16.370
syntax highlighting that are really
handy for making computer programs.

42
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.710
But I think the main reason why I like
it is you could just be really fast.

43
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.415
You can kind of shred on text files
once you get good enough at it.

44
00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:33.954
VI isn't the only kind of editor
that you can use when you're

45
00:03:33.954 --> 00:03:37.879
logged into a remote system,
for example over SSH.

46
00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:44.679
You can also use things like nano or emex,
but I'd say emex is a pretty good editor,

47
00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:48.780
but it's a little bit
more long-winded than VI.

48
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.640
It doesn't quite have all of the terse
little shortcuts that you get in VI.

49
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.690
Although, of course,
emex is extremely configurable, so

50
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.580
you can configure it to
behave just like VI or

51
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.245
Vim, but then at that point,
why not just use VI, it's great.

52
00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:10.900
[LAUGH] There's also nano
which is a lot easier to use,

53
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.510
but it's kind of,
I would say it's a bit clunky to use.

54
00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.360
It's not quite as terse
at a lot of things, and

55
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.840
it can't really do a whole lot, either.

56
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.970
But if you're on a system,
if you're SSH'ed into something,

57
00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.950
it's perfectly capable at editing files.

58
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.430
And it's very commonly already installed
on systems, so it's good to know.

59
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.363
It's good to like experiment
a little bit with

60
00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:39.054
it,
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: But

61
00:04:39.054 --> 00:04:41.022
we'r e going to be during VI.

62
00:04:41.022 --> 00:04:48.290
So VI or Vim is an example of
a program that's interactive.

63
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.010
So this means that it uses ANSI codes

64
00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.160
which are special character sequences
that do things that control colors.

65
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.150
They can also move the cursor around.

66
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.740
It can blink even, the text.

67
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.770
So here I've got in
the notes a little bit of

68
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.460
fun things you can try out if
you like just to play around.

69
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.260
So if you do this echo command,
-e means interpret escape sequences.

70
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.280
You can do this hexadecimal escape
sequence, x1b, and then print stuff out.

71
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.100
So I'll just show you really
quick what this does.

72
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.287
Yeah, so it's kind of cyan colored text.

73
00:05:28.287 --> 00:05:35.112
You can do other colors by changing
these values, so, whoa, that's neat.

74
00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:36.622
That's the background, that's cool.

75
00:05:36.622 --> 00:05:41.340
Anyways, sort of what editors like VI and

76
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.120
also other interactive programs
are doing behind the scenes.

77
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:50.390
More fun stuff and a Wikipedia page that
you can play with later if you like.
