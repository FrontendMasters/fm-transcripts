1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.389
&gt;&gt; James: The shell is, like I said,
a computer program that's use to launch

2
00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:10.079
other computer programs, and
it does this via a text interface.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.684
&gt;&gt; James: So, you type in things like
commands and the commands have arguments.

4
00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:20.040
And then, they can read from
the standard input, the keyboard or

5
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.590
another program, and
it can write to standard output.

6
00:00:24.153 --> 00:00:29.955
&gt;&gt; James: And, the first UNIX shells,
I think the first one was in 1971.

7
00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:34.818
I think it's on the next slide are very
strongly influenced the shells that

8
00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:39.569
we even use today like to the point
where they're fairly recognizable.

9
00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:43.770
And you can even run some programs that
were made on those very early shells,

10
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.510
on a modern shell.

11
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.940
Or you can actually run the C program, and
compile it even today, and it still works.

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.340
So you could actually run this old
software, which is pretty fascinating.

13
00:00:55.714 --> 00:01:00.675
&gt;&gt; James: Here's a list of some shells,
and not a complete list, of course,

14
00:01:00.675 --> 00:01:03.970
because anyone can write their own shell.

15
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:04.470
It's kinda fun.

16
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.156
&gt;&gt; James: But a lot of them are very old,

17
00:01:08.156 --> 00:01:12.684
so the first one was the Thompson shell in
1971, and then there were a bunch more.

18
00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:18.588
Probably the most important one's today
are bash, which we're gonna be learning,

19
00:01:18.588 --> 00:01:24.337
which was in 1987 and it's been maintained
since then by another maintainer.

20
00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:28.473
And also it's important to
know about ash and dash,

21
00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:32.609
because they show up in places
like busy box Linux and

22
00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:38.350
they're also the default shell on
different kinds of like dbm systems.

23
00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:45.231
&gt;&gt; James: So,
&gt;&gt; James: The other

24
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:50.375
important thing to note is that,
it's not just enough to know POSIX and

25
00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:53.333
to know how the kernel Cisco is working.

26
00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:57.814
Then to know the show works because,
everything on

27
00:01:57.814 --> 00:02:02.340
a Unix system kind of exist in
this ecosystem of other programs.

28
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.123
And one of the really
important ideas is that,

29
00:02:06.123 --> 00:02:10.782
you can build programs by
combining existing programs.

30
00:02:10.782 --> 00:02:14.760
And,
&gt;&gt; James: So, that's why a big part of

31
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.442
this talk is gonna be diving into a lot
of the programs that you're likely

32
00:02:19.442 --> 00:02:23.460
to find on a Unix system, and
how you can plumb them together.

33
00:02:26.515 --> 00:02:30.776
&gt;&gt; James: I think it's also important to
know, like even though this is a very old

34
00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:35.624
operating system that started out in 1969,
it's still extremely common.

35
00:02:35.624 --> 00:02:40.618
And this is important because
it's a proven model that's worked

36
00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:44.519
in a lot of different cases,
like it's on phones,

37
00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.715
it's on like my laptop,
it's on any of your laptops.

38
00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:52.553
It's also got a really vast ecosystem
especially of open source software.

39
00:02:52.553 --> 00:03:00.110
And text is also a very powerful interface
for some reasons I will get into.

40
00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:05.650
&gt;&gt; James: Some fun places where
you might not expect Unix to live.

41
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.530
So I could tell you a little story.

42
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.310
One time, when I was living in Fairbanks,

43
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.047
Alaska,
&gt;&gt; James: Going to college there,

44
00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:15.195
I was doing an end map,
which is a port scan,

45
00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:19.086
to figure out what the IP address of the
desktop computer in the living room was,

46
00:03:19.086 --> 00:03:22.760
cuz I didn't wanna go over there and
type something in.

47
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.400
And so, I was searching for
anything running on port 22,

48
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.570
which is the port used for SSH,
which is a kind of secure login.

49
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.420
And, I noticed,
I found the desktop, of course.

50
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.678
And I found my wireless router which
I'd flashed with I think DDWRT which

51
00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:46.813
is a custom firmware that you can flash
some kinds of routers, Wi-Fi routers with.

52
00:03:46.813 --> 00:03:51.322
We were using that to actually mirror
the open Linksys routers that we could get

53
00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:55.465
more reliably because we didn't have
Internet that time at the house.

54
00:03:55.465 --> 00:03:57.855
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; James: Anyways, but then later,

55
00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:02.780
we got a DSL modem, and I noticed that
the DSL modem IP address showed up

56
00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.290
as listening on port 22,
which was very interesting.

57
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.240
And so, I tried to SSH into it with
the same password used for the web login,

58
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.190
and there I was at,
[LAUGH] at a Unix shell.

59
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.730
And I had all kinds of commands
that I expected to be there.

60
00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.494
I managed to figure out how,
just with some Unix commands,

61
00:04:25.494 --> 00:04:31.517
how to copy all of the copy the entire
image of the system out to my computer.

62
00:04:31.517 --> 00:04:35.838
And I was like poking around and didn't
really find anything interesting but

63
00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:39.695
that's just one of the many kinds of
places where you might find a Unix

64
00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:40.576
command line.

65
00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:41.709
I can show you also, so

66
00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:45.120
I've got this other computer right
here that many of you have seen.

67
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.950
I'll just hold it up so
that the livestream can see.

68
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.110
This is a Raspberry Pi that's set up
to be a pneumatic computing device.

69
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.288
So I've got goggles here that I can wear.

70
00:04:58.288 --> 00:05:04.710
And it's running Raspbian, which is
a distribution of Linux based on Debian.

71
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.240
And I can SSH into this computer,
&gt;&gt; James: From my terminal right here.

72
00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.246
And here I go, I'm on a Unix system.

73
00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:17.810
I can do things like,
I can see what kind of processor I have.

74
00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.986
So I've got, this is a Raspberry Pi 3, so

75
00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:26.217
it's actually got quad-core ARM7
processor, it's pretty good.

76
00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:31.870
And another place where you might
find Unix shell is an Android phone.

77
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.690
So if you've configured an Android
phone to be in developer mode

78
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.492
which you can do I think by clicking the,
if you go into the Settings page,

79
00:05:40.492 --> 00:05:42.480
like About, there's a version number.

80
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.060
If you click it seven times,
you can put your phone in developer mode.

81
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.610
And then, if you have this program
installed called ADB, you can do,

82
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.520
adb shell.

83
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.620
And now, here I go,
I have a shell that's running on my phone.

84
00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.670
So I can list files, I can move around,
I can see what's on the SD card.

85
00:06:06.184 --> 00:06:11.055
&gt;&gt; James: I can do all kinds of fun stuff,
which is I think a lot nicer than writing

86
00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:15.900
Java [LAUGH] or using somebody
else's program to fiddle around.

87
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.733
So it's really useful, you can install
software offline if you have the APK file,

88
00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:21.388
using the command line on Android.

89
00:06:21.388 --> 00:06:22.514
A lot of things,

90
00:06:22.514 --> 00:06:27.830
I think are a lot simpler if you wanna
play around with a phone that you've got.

91
00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:35.555
&gt;&gt; James: Also, it's a really important,
&gt;&gt; James: System for

92
00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:40.594
operating things like web servers or
other pieces of Internet infrastructure.

93
00:06:40.594 --> 00:06:45.057
So,
&gt;&gt; James: The command-line is kind of,

94
00:06:45.057 --> 00:06:49.250
it's in a lot of places,
maybe a lot more than you might think.

95
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.440
And the important part is that,
if you know the command-line,

96
00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.090
that skill is extremely transferable
to all of those different places.

97
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.200
And a lot of those kinds of hardware
might not even have something like

98
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.110
a graphical display.

99
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.251
So the command-line is the only way that
you can really interface with some of

100
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:07.940
these systems.

101
00:07:10.483 --> 00:07:12.840
&gt;&gt; James: This is because
it uses a text interface.

102
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.680
So,
&gt;&gt; James: Really nice thing about a text

103
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.782
interface is all that you need to
interact with the system, if you have

104
00:07:22.782 --> 00:07:28.161
a text interface like a shell is some
way of getting data into and out of it.

105
00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:32.924
So that could be a network connection,
it could be a serial port link,

106
00:07:32.924 --> 00:07:36.605
it could be Bluetooth or
maybe a web socket.

107
00:07:36.605 --> 00:07:41.075
All kinds of ways that you
can establish a connection

108
00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:44.313
where a text interface will be useful.

109
00:07:47.098 --> 00:07:52.361
&gt;&gt; James: So I think the other really
important thing about the Unix system and

110
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:57.625
using the command-line and
knowing the command-line well is this

111
00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:02.813
idea of the Unix philosophy,
which is many kind of related ideas.

112
00:08:02.813 --> 00:08:07.428
It's sort of hard to pin down exactly
what is in a single sentence, but

113
00:08:07.428 --> 00:08:13.260
some a the main ideas are that if you have
programs, they should do one thing well.

114
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.270
They shouldn't like have
a bunch a features,

115
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:20.420
they should really kind of have a narrow
scope for what their purpose is.

116
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.070
So they're fairly simple, typically.

117
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.060
And that you should be able to combine
these single purpose programs to

118
00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:33.620
build bigger programs by kind of plumbing
them together with things like pipes and

119
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.720
redirects and that sort of stuff.

120
00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:41.641
&gt;&gt; James: So there is a really great
book published by Bell Labs in 1984

121
00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:44.534
called Unix Programming Environment.

122
00:08:44.534 --> 00:08:46.725
I think you can find PDFs on the Internet,
and

123
00:08:46.725 --> 00:08:49.420
it kind of goes through
a lot of this stuff.

124
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.469
Some of the stuff just kind outdated but
a lot of the philosophy and

125
00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:55.030
even a lot of the commands
are still applicable today.
