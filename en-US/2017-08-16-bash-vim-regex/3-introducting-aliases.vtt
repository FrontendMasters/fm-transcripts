00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Some of my favorite
switches for LS are -1, which is really

2
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:12.310
useful for scripts which makes sure that
all of the files are in a single column.

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:15.728
So you can sort of process
them line by line instead of

4
00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.065
having to parse the column format.

5
00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:21.991
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: It
can also do things like

6
00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:27.860
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: -F, capital F,

7
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.150
and --color=auto.

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.570
I don't know if this will work
on Mac with BSD version LS, but

9
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.340
on Linux,
it's a pretty good version of LS.

10
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.609
It gives you things like colors and
it provides the,

11
00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.170
like if there's a slash on
the end of this directory, so

12
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.995
you can sort of tell things apart.

13
00:00:56.782 --> 00:00:59.379
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: All of these options
are documented in the min page,

14
00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.430
it's called for-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you go back to your

15
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.990
aliases?

16
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.310
That's actually really interesting.

17
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.561
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Yeah,
I've got all kinds of fun stuff in there.

18
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:12.357
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: I

19
00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:13.880
don't know why I have an Emacs alias.

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.867
I never use that.

21
00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:27.465
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: There's my tslide alias
that turns of the syntax highlighting.

22
00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:37.294
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Someone's asking
how do I exit the man command?

23
00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:38.240
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Q.

24
00:01:51.014 --> 00:01:53.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Will we go
into creating aliases?

25
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.150
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: I forget if I put
it in the notes, but we can do that.

26
00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.890
I'll could show you right now.

27
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.950
If you have a command that you want to run
in a custom way, you can use an alias.

28
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.070
If I wanna create an alias for
the OS commands, that is like ls -1.

29
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.460
If I only want to see column output,
I can do that with quotes.

30
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.358
LS thinks I always see them line by line.

31
00:02:22.358 --> 00:02:27.620
You can do this with pretty much any
command, including composing commands.

32
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.070
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Then lets say
you wanted to remove that?

33
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.040
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So in this case,
you can just close the shell and open it

34
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.790
again, cuz I didn't save it anywhere,
so ls is back to its default behavior.

35
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.420
If you want to save your aliases
you can use one of your rc files.

36
00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.550
So if you open ~/.bashrc, and

37
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.250
I'm gonna go into more about
what the tilde means, and

38
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.320
what the dot file means,
then you can set up aliases in there.

39
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.500
So this is an example of a bash script,
which

40
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.200
we're gonna be talking a lot more about
once we have learned some more commands.

41
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.690
So you can put your aliases in there.
