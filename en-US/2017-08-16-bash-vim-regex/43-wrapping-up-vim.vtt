00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.620
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: More fun tricks.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.880
There aren't too many more of these,
but these are choice tricks.

3
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.650
So if you wanna insert another
file into your current file.

4
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.480
So a good example is if you got a little

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.060
snippet of code you need to stick into
the current file, you can totally do that.

6
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.198
So this is a bad example, but
if I wanna stick in the package.json

7
00:00:25.198 --> 00:00:30.906
file into this file where I currently am,
you can do :r space filename.

8
00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:35.784
And that just pastes in that whole file's
contents, you don't have to copy it into

9
00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:39.140
your clipboard and paste it,
you can just do it this way.

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.049
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Use pipe, [CROSSTALK]
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: You can, so

11
00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.033
to pipe the output of a command,
you can do :r!,

12
00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.500
and then you can type a command in.

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.305
So here I can paste the date

14
00:00:55.305 --> 00:01:00.767
command by doing :r!date,

15
00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.614
date command.

16
00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:09.019
So you can combine all of
these ideas in different ways,

17
00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:14.424
so for example if I visually
select some blocks of code,

18
00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:19.369
and then I wanna run that
block through a command and

19
00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:26.499
display the output in the file,
I can do from visual mode &gt;r!wc -l, and

20
00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:33.040
then it will run, I guess you have
to control c it or something.

21
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.449
Anyways, I think if you do it
with :w maybe that would work.

22
00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:43.155
Anyways, there are ways to
combine this kind of stuff.

23
00:01:43.155 --> 00:01:46.270
I think maybe I had some of those.

24
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.799
Yeah, so if you wanna check out
my vimrc file which is fantastic,

25
00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.516
it's in the notes.

26
00:01:53.516 --> 00:01:57.616
Otherwise, if you really like VIM,

27
00:01:57.616 --> 00:02:04.720
you can configure your terminal
to work the way that VIM works.

28
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.570
So for example,
here I'm in my terminal, right?

29
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.140
I can hit Escape, I can hit K, K,
K, K, K, J, J to go up and down.

30
00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.730
I can also do, I can do things like F

31
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.900
space jumps to the space.

32
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.210
I can do dollar sign,
jumps to the end of line 0, so

33
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.680
you enable this by typing
set -0vi like that.

34
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.870
The default mode is Emax mode by the way,

35
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.530
which is like all kinds
like control the combos.

36
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.891
I don't know even know how to use,
but I know how use this one, cuz I VI,

37
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:41.577
it's great.

38
00:02:46.675 --> 00:02:49.877
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So I see on the chat,
there's can you paste the same

39
00:02:49.877 --> 00:02:54.440
line where your cursor is located if
you select the complete line shift.

40
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.994
I don't know how to parse that exactly,
but maybe I'll get to that later.

41
00:03:01.994 --> 00:03:05.820
Also, if you wanna remap your
caps lock key to be escape,

42
00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.070
then I recommend that as well.

43
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.850
It's fantastic, once you get use to them,
it's right there next to your pinky, so

44
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.458
you only gotta like move it a little bit.

45
00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:16.407
It's really great.

46
00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:18.659
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
you can do that just in vim.

47
00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.420
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: You have to do
that configure your operating system.

48
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.550
So like on Linux you can use X mod map.

49
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.080
I don't know what you do on Mac but,
place in similar.

50
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.867
There's also Ctrl+].

51
00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:36.505
If you do that,
I think you get out of escape mode, and

52
00:03:36.505 --> 00:03:39.270
you can also do Ctrl+C to
get out of insert mode.

53
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.990
So sometimes that's easier than
configuring your Esc keys.

54
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.550
So that is what I have to
present about them, and

55
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.130
that's everything, so
if anyone has any questions.

56
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.150
I guess there was a questions whichl
I will have to parse very carefully

57
00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.722
in the chat, but, okay, thanks.
