&gt;&gt; James Halliday: The next thing
that I wanted to talk about is

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.080
sort of a little bit more
information about how paths work.

3
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.950
Because it's kind of important
to know how paths work and

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.330
what the expectations are if
the path's in a directory system.

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.530
So, we've already used things like dot and
dot dot a little bit, and tilde.

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.706
So, paths that use '.' and

7
00:00:26.706 --> 00:00:30.720
'..' at the beginning
are called relative paths.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.360
This also includes
something like if you do,

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.360
if I do like head moby-dick.txt,
this is an example of a relative path,

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.470
because it's relative to
the current directory.

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.380
It's also the same as doing ./ the file,
it's also the same

12
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.370
as a bunch of, as many dot slashes as you
want, cuz it means the current directory.

13
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.680
These are all examples of relative paths.

14
00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.130
Where if I want to do ls ../ also
an example of a relative path, because

15
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.110
what directory you're in, what your
current working directory is, Matters.

16
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.820
There's also absolute paths which
typically begin with a slash or I guess

17
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.950
if you begin a path with tilde that's
also an example of an absolute path.

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.660
And with these paths it doesn't matter

19
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.360
where you are in the directory system
with the CD commands, they will work.

20
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.440
The same from anywhere.

21
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.260
And if you want to get the absolute
path for the current directory,

22
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.930
we've already seen the pwd commands.

23
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.790
So if I do ls, that absolutely path,
that's the same as doing ls.

24
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.040
Or just just ls, okay?
