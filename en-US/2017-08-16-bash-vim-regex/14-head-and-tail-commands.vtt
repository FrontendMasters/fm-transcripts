&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Now I just wanna
cover some more utilities that you're

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.070
very likely to find on
pretty much any Unix system.

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.971
So the first one is called head,
we've used it a few times already.

4
00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:17.474
It prints out starting from the beginning
of a file, it prints out a certain number

5
00:00:17.474 --> 00:00:22.922
of characters or a certain number of lines
starting from the beginning of a file.

6
00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:30.129
So if I do head -n5 moby-dick.txt,
I see the first five lines.

7
00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:33.858
There's also one called tail,
tail is like head but

8
00:00:33.858 --> 00:00:37.182
it starts at the end,
and it reads backwards.

9
00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:40.968
So if I want the last five lines,
I can do that.

10
00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:44.884
Head and tail,
if you don't specify a file name,

11
00:00:44.884 --> 00:00:48.160
we'll read from standard in by default.

12
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.029
So if you have other commands,
that's like spammy, and

13
00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:57.524
you only care about the last bit or the
first bit, see we have our git log, right.

14
00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:04.107
If I only want the first line of output,
I can pipe into head-n1,

15
00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:09.879
and I get just the commit message,
which is kind of handy.

16
00:01:13.413 --> 00:01:17.318
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: If you read the man
page for head, there's different options,

17
00:01:17.318 --> 00:01:21.945
-n gives you the number of lines, but
if you want the number of characters or

18
00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:24.260
bytes you can use -c.

19
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.038
So for example if I do had -c 10,
I just get the first 10 characters.

20
00:01:31.038 --> 00:01:34.490
And you can see that it doesn't
give a new line there so

21
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.260
you gotta hit enter if you want.

22
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.324
Just type it in, or you could do that and
that would add a new line.

23
00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:45.330
Get a little more into how to
chain tick of a commands in a bit.
