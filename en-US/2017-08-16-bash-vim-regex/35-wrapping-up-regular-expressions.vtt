00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Okay, so I think we've
pretty much covered all of the rules.

2
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.340
There's not really any more to it,
to regular expressions.

3
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.530
It's just kind of a matter of practice and

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.339
a matter of kind of building up intuitions
about when to use what kinds of things.

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.352
Very useful, but it takes time and
takes practice to kind of be

6
00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:30.435
able to parse some regular expression
that you see in a file and

7
00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:33.590
understand what it means sometimes.

8
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.929
Sometimes they're just
really complicated though,

9
00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:38.791
especially if they're kind of
machine generated or really long.

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.865
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: But you can always
go in, and if you know the rules,

11
00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:47.210
you can kind of pick
apart what each means.

12
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.550
And then kind of come up with
an idea of what it's doing
