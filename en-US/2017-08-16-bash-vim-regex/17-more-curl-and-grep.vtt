00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.170
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: We
talked about curl already.

2
00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.320
There's a lot of different
options to curl.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.910
I really recommend that
if you get the time and

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.950
you wanna go through the manual for
curl, it's well worth your time.

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.860
Because you can do all kinds of things
with curl, like sending post requests.

6
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.120
If you're running HTTP servers at all or
if you need to interface with HTTP APIs.

7
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:28.960
You can do things, like a curl- X POST,
which will send a post request.

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.111
And you can do something, like do a file
upload with T and T- from standard in.

9
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:40.170
So some API service you're
running locally, like that, so

10
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.430
you can do all kinds of fun stuff.

11
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.850
Or you can do a form upload with -d.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.350
And that lets you set different fields.

13
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.887
So user=whatever -d

14
00:00:52.887 --> 00:00:57.190
hello=blah, to d.

15
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.100
So curl is certainly worth your time.

16
00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.820
I don't wanna get too much into it here.

17
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.100
I will get more into it on one of
the other workshops about the networking.

18
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.750
All of the kinds of things
that you can do with curl.

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.190
But curl is very excellent
to have in your tool belt of

20
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.630
things that you can kinda
keep on the top of your head,

21
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.568
cuz it just comes up all the time
dealing with HTTP servers.

22
00:01:22.568 --> 00:01:26.513
So one fun thing you can do with curl and

23
00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:30.219
GitHub is GitHub has a special URL.

24
00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:34.579
So you can take anyone's
GitHub account name and

25
00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:38.739
go to github.com/substack, for example.

26
00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.021
Then add .keys at the end of that.

27
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:44.750
And you'll get a list of
all of their public keys.

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.440
So here we've got a bunch of output,

29
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.280
like an old RSA key that I guess
they still have on GitHub.

30
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.490
We have some ed25519 keys, so
I can use grep to pull those out.

31
00:01:59.612 --> 00:02:01.130
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Here,
we can see what those look like.

32
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.590
We can use some of the other commands
that we've been dealing with,

33
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.280
like head, to get the first one.

34
00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:11.760
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: We can even
use sed to cut out the first bit.

35
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.640
Or actually, I would use awk for that.

36
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.580
I won't go into that,
but you can do things,

37
00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.230
like this with awk, to print out
the second field in the result.

38
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.004
Very handy little tools that you
kinda have to know about them.

39
00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:29.251
And it's sort of not obvious what
they're even called or what they're for.

40
00:02:29.251 --> 00:02:36.161
But they're already installed on
your system, which is really useful.

41
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:37.849
I'll talk a bit about grep.

42
00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.116
And I'm gonna be going
a lot more into grep and

43
00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:43.540
sed in the regular expression
section that's coming up.

44
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.165
But you can use it to search for patterns.

45
00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.994
So here, I searched for
the pattern beginning,

46
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:53.650
like starting from the beginning of
the language is what a caret means.

47
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.468
Searching for
the string ssh-ed25519 to pull out

48
00:02:58.468 --> 00:03:03.093
my 25519 keys not the RSA keys or
the other ones.
