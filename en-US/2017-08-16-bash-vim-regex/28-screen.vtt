00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.210
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: I really like Screen.

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:04.480
It's a very nifty little tool.

3
00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.490
Like here, I can just show you the screens
that I'm running on my system right now.

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.040
So I'm running like three screens to
run different daemons and things,

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.430
like Secure Scuttlebutt.

6
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.280
And show you my WiFi screen.

7
00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.469
So this is running some
command line WiFi stuff,

8
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.420
cuz I don't like the little applets where
you gotta click on WiFis and whatever so

9
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.580
I just made it into my wifi
with some command line tools.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.220
Another really useful
thing that you can use for

11
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.370
screen is if you ssh into a server,
you can like kinda have stuff running, and

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.620
then you can sort of attach to it later.

13
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.870
So here, I can login to my command
line IRC client that's running.

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.980
And there it is, it's just running,
doing its thing.

15
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.044
Now I can detach from this,
so I do control AD, whoops.

16
00:00:56.044 --> 00:01:01.120
And now, it's still running, but I'm not
looking at it anymore, and I can logout.

17
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.730
If I log in again it's
still gonna be running.

18
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.720
So it's sort of like a way that you can
just leave something to do its thing, and

19
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.600
you can check on it later, or whatever.

20
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.250
So, if you're on a Linux system,

21
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.540
you generally don't have this by default
unless someone already installed it.

22
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.740
I don't know on Mac,
if you have to brew install or anything,

23
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.250
if someone could check that really quick,
it'd be handy.

24
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.700
If you just type screen, what happens?

25
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:28.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, I got it.

26
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.040
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Okay, cool, so I guess
you might have it on Mac already, but

27
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.360
on Linux, you might have to install it.

28
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.270
So if you just type screen,

29
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.400
it's just gonna look like,
I guess it does that now, that's weird.

30
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.330
But it's going to drop you into a shell,

31
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.320
which you can either do control-b or
type exit to get out of.

32
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.640
After a page of spam,
I guess that's what it does.

33
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.100
If you want to create a screen that
has a name, though, because by default

34
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.040
if you just do a screen maybe it only
does that when I'm in a low res.

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.390
Let me see.
I don't know,

36
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.810
it's just always annoying like that.

37
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.230
So, if you do that,
I can list out everything.

38
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.610
You can see that it
doesn't have a name now.

39
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.300
If you want to give your screens a name,
which I recommend,

40
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.080
because it's easier to keep track of them,
you can do screen, -S and

41
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.140
then give it a name like wow or whatever.

42
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.730
Now if you do screen- list we see that
a screen called whatever is attached,

43
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.460
and all the other screens are detached.

44
00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.850
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So screen-list is how
you can see what all of the screens that

45
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.978
are running on your system are.

46
00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.179
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: And so the first thing
that you can try once you're running

47
00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.930
a screen like I'm running this screen,
is do control a.

48
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.950
As, like, one thing,
like hold down Control and

49
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.230
hit the A key, no, what up,
and hit the D key.

50
00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.760
And that will detach from the screen.

51
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.310
And then to attach back
to that same screen,

52
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.040
you can do screen- x and
then give it the name.

53
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.490
So I called that screen whatever,
so now I can reattach with that.

54
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.370
And if you see,
I'm back exactly where I left off.

55
00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:44.350
So again, it's Ctrl A, then D, and
then Ctrl+X and the name to go back.

56
00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:50.809
After you create a name to screen
with screen -S and then the name.

57
00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:57.062
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: The steps.

58
00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:02.850
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Yeah?

59
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.000
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does screen
load your bash profile?

60
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.920
I'm getting errors trying
to parse a function, for

61
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.970
instance, from my batch profile.

62
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.560
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: It should
load your bash profile, yes.

63
00:04:19.366 --> 00:04:22.390
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: It should be pretty
similar to if you open a new terminal.

64
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.870
It would do the same steps, more or less.

65
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.373
Another fun thing to try,
once you've got screen running,

66
00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:37.610
is you can create a new
window with Ctrl A C.

67
00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.706
So I can show you what that looks like.

68
00:04:40.706 --> 00:04:45.368
So, Ctrl A C, and now I'm on a new window,
which is like a new terminal.

69
00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:50.530
You can do,
watch dash n1 date on that window.

70
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.030
And if you want to switch between windows,

71
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.060
you can do Ctrl a n to go the next one,
Ctrl+a+p to go to the previous one.

72
00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.620
So it's sort of like you have a list
of these windows that wraps around and

73
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.820
you can kind of switch between them.

74
00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:21.870
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: And if you want to
exit from a screen, you can type Ctrl d.

75
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.900
Or you can type exit, and
it will close that window.

76
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.570
And once all of the windows are closed
on a screen, then the screen,

77
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.530
it says the screen is terminating and

78
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.880
then that screen doesn't show
up on screen dash list anymore.

79
00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:43.090
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So if you want,
so a really fun, well.

80
00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.760
So screen is really good for
running little servers and things.

81
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.460
You could run things in a while true do,
your

82
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.440
server program done loop inside of
a screen and then detach from it.

83
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.130
It's also really good if you want
to run a command line IRC client,

84
00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.890
because then if you have a server, you can
just have that running all the time and

85
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.300
connect to it, like I have over here.

86
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.520
You can also use this program called Mosh,
instead of SSH.

87
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.830
And it will automatically reconnect for
you.

88
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.670
If you go on a different WiFi,
it's seamless.

89
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.770
And then just have your IRC
client running all the time.

90
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.250
And it's like,
you don't have to, someone wants

91
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.210
to message you, they can, you'll see what
they had to tell you when you're away.

92
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:41.690
That's more or less all that we
need to do to play with screen.

93
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:45.660
If you want, in the notes,
I have a little test server if you wanna

94
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.430
play around with getting that
to run inside of a screen.

95
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.200
And then you can leave it
running on your system.

96
00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:59.550
And that is all that I have for
the bash workshop.
