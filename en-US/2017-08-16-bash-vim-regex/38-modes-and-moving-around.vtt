00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.580
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Things like insert
mode and command mode are known as modes.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.090
There are few more modes.

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.070
There's visual mode.

4
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.361
There's more, but they're kind of,
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Like I've

5
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:17.426
never needed to use any of the other ones.

6
00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:19.160
So I don't know.

7
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.392
That might be it, but who knows?

8
00:00:20.392 --> 00:00:22.501
Vim is one of those really,

9
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:27.748
really deep topics where nobody
ever really knows the whole thing.

10
00:00:27.748 --> 00:00:32.600
But you can get by with
knowing enough of it, I guess,

11
00:00:41.725 --> 00:00:43.261
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: As you're moving around

12
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.360
in the text file.

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.250
So you can use the arrow keys and
that happens to work.

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.390
Although if you're in an old school VI,
then arrow keys probably will not work.

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.634
It'll print like some sequence.

16
00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:02.200
So what you have to do instead is,

17
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.790
from command mode, you can use j and
k to go up and down.

18
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.820
So let's write some text out.

19
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.518
You can use k to go up, j to go down,

20
00:01:17.518 --> 00:01:21.740
l to go right, and h to go left.

21
00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.430
And if you look at some keywords,
that VI was originally written on,

22
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.880
they actually had the arrows printed
on hjkl, like up, down, left, right.

23
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.080
And they didn't have a separate pad
where you could have arrow keys.

24
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.400
It was actually built into the physical
keyboard, this kind of thing.

25
00:01:48.801 --> 00:01:53.372
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: You might
notice that in other places,

26
00:01:53.372 --> 00:01:58.506
this j to go down,
k to go up, is available.

27
00:01:58.506 --> 00:02:05.967
If you open up less of some file,
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: In less,

28
00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:09.660
you can actually also use j to go down and
k to go up.

29
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.808
Also in Twitter and in Gmail, same thing,

30
00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:18.150
because this convention is extremely
established among programmers.

31
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.130
So they'll often put it into
whatever they're working on.

32
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.680
So a lot of the time, it's like a neat
little Easter egg that you can use these

33
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.020
shortcuts kind of all over the place.

34
00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.970
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Okay, so here are some
more ways of moving around inside of Vim.

35
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.938
If you remember, from the regex section,

36
00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:49.200
we used the caret that was
the anchor to the start of the line.

37
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.850
There's a similar thing in
VI where the caret means

38
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.970
jump to the beginning of the lines.

39
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.115
So here, if I'm kind of far
off onto the right side,

40
00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:01.615
I can hop to the beginning
by typing a caret.

41
00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:04.664
I can hop to the end by
typing a dollar sign.

42
00:03:04.664 --> 00:03:06.636
Just like regular expressions.

43
00:03:06.636 --> 00:03:07.747
Kinda of neat.

44
00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:10.575
You can also hop to the beginning
with a zero, which I usually do,

45
00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:13.070
because then you don't have
to hold the Shift key down.

46
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.360
So 0, $, 0, $.

47
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.860
So once you're at the end of the line,
if you go up and

48
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.300
down, it stays at the end of the dollar
sign, which is kind of nice, or

49
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.038
it stays at the rightmost position.

50
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:33.693
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: If you want to
hop to the beginning of the file,

51
00:03:33.693 --> 00:03:36.540
you can do gg in command mode.

52
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.570
So gg, beginning of the file.

53
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:47.042
And then G goes to the end of the file.

54
00:03:48.976 --> 00:03:53.306
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So, gg, G, $, 0, $, ^.
