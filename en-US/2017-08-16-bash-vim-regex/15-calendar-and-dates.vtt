00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.863
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: So head and
tail are pretty handy.

2
00:00:02.863 --> 00:00:05.547
There's also one that's
a calendar on the command line.

3
00:00:05.547 --> 00:00:10.945
I use this all the time as well, cuz I'm
pretty much always in the command line,

4
00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:15.550
and if you just want to see a really
simple calendar, here you go.

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.281
So we see that it's May 2,
2017, and happily,

6
00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:24.040
the 2 is printed with reverse video.

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.220
So it comes up with a black background,
in this case.

8
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a way
of changing that when you're

9
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.380
doing dark mode because
the black background is black?

10
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.830
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: It's reverse video.

11
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.568
So that means that if you have a black
background it should show up as white, and

12
00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:41.305
if you have a white background
it should show up as black.

13
00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:43.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think there's
something with Mac again.

14
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.132
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Macs, you're weird.

15
00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:47.098
I don't know anything about Macs.

16
00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:48.333
I can't help you there.

17
00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:50.080
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Noted.

18
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.316
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: [LAUGH] But also,

19
00:00:52.316 --> 00:00:57.200
you can do things like if you want
to see all of 2017, there we are.

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.210
Whole calendar to play with.

21
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.916
You can pipe that into head -n5, and

22
00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:07.683
the first five lines of the output of
the calendar command, it's kind of handy.

23
00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:09.417
You can also do things like,

24
00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:15.360
if you wanna see October,
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: I

25
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.701
guess you have to say oct 2017.

26
00:01:17.701 --> 00:01:20.110
You have to give it the year as well,
but there we go.

27
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.690
Also another handy thing is cal -3,

28
00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.380
will print out the previous month,
current month, and the next month.

29
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.401
That's the one that I use all the time,
it's super handy.

30
00:01:35.953 --> 00:01:37.060
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Just a fun thing.

31
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.200
There's also the date command.

32
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.480
If you type date, it will print
out the current time and date, and

33
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.924
the date command is really fun, cuz it
has these things called format strings.

34
00:01:50.924 --> 00:01:52.455
This goes out to a system call.

35
00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:55.473
If you remember from at the beginning,

36
00:01:55.473 --> 00:02:01.417
we were talking about how the kernel
works to get different date parameters,

37
00:02:01.417 --> 00:02:06.264
and there's something in POSIX
that's called STRF time, and

38
00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:12.678
STRF time specifies this little language
for doing things like formatting dates.

39
00:02:12.678 --> 00:02:19.644
So if we want just the hours and
minutes we can do %H is hours,

40
00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:25.120
and %M is minutes, it's 13:13 I guess.

41
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.424
That should be 13:14 by now.

42
00:02:27.424 --> 00:02:30.054
No, it's still 13:13.

43
00:02:30.054 --> 00:02:33.217
So we can do %H:%M:%S and

44
00:02:33.217 --> 00:02:38.533
every one of those percents
is replaced by hours,

45
00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:42.339
minutes, seconds, in this case.

46
00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:49.516
There's also one for the year,
the full year, 2017.

47
00:02:49.516 --> 00:02:54.679
There's also one for the month,
which is the lowercase m,

48
00:02:54.679 --> 00:03:00.256
and the day is d, and there's
a shortcut for a few of these things

49
00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:05.437
like the year, month,
date format like this with dashes.

50
00:03:05.437 --> 00:03:11.288
There's a shortcut called %F that gives
you that, and there's a shortcut for

51
00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:16.100
the other part which is %,
I actually forget what it's called.

52
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.000
So, we can look at the mandate, and
if you scroll down a couple of pages,

53
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.670
there's whole section about
what all of this presents mean.

54
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.061
So, if we see the part with the hours,
minutes,

55
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:32.928
seconds, there should be something like,

56
00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:37.280
here we go, %X, I think, and %T.

57
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.180
Right, so
I think %T is a little bit nicer than %X.

58
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.272
I don't really care what the locale is,
I want it to always look like that.

59
00:03:48.272 --> 00:03:52.708
Date is sometimes really handy if you
wanna do something with this format

60
00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:53.386
strings.

61
00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:54.810
If you wanna do something like

62
00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.610
automatically generate a log file that
has the date in it, it's very useful for

63
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.770
that, because you can do things like,
I'll show in a bit how to use

64
00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.170
back ticks to use these commands to kind
of like create file names in place and

65
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.110
that kind of stuff, but
we have something like %F, we could do

66
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.570
something like echo `.txt, and

67
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.890
that bit inside the backticks
is substituted for that file.

68
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.930
So you can do something
like echo hello there

69
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.700
appends to a log file that has a name
that's based on the current date.

70
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.367
So there'll be a new log file every day.
