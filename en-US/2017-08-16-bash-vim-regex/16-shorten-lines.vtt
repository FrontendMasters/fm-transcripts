&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Another fun little
utility to play around with is called

2
00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:05.201
fold.

3
00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:09.687
So if you wanna format text to
do things like word wrapping,

4
00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:11.940
you can use the fold command.

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.290
So for example,
going back to Moby Dick for a bit.

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.730
So if we pull out the first 250 lines of
Moby Dick, maybe we wanna format it so

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.405
that,
&gt;&gt; James Halliday: Instead

8
00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:33.990
of these really wide columns, or instead
of this really wide output, we can have it

9
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.259
be formatted a little more narrowly,
cuz sometimes that's easier to read.

10
00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:42.611
So we can do fold -w 30, and

11
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:48.910
that uses 30 characters of width.

12
00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.110
And then, it's a little bit annoying,

13
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.480
because it actually breaks
the output in between words.

14
00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.744
So if you don't want it to do that,
I think it's -sw, yeah,

15
00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:02.966
and that will break it on words.

16
00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.116
Of course,
there's already new lines in the file, so

17
00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:06.390
it's kind of annoying as well.

18
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.551
But you could use a little set expression
if you want to kind of cut things up in

19
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:13.490
a better way, and
you can format it however you like.
