1
00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.124
We've seen how to generate a cell.

2
00:00:05.124 --> 00:00:12.216
What do you think goes
into generating a layer?

3
00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:21.516
So, with that said for
a second Think of something,

4
00:00:21.516 --> 00:00:26.480
and now I'm going to answer it and
you can check your answer.

5
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.030
The difference between
generating a cell and a layer.

6
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.844
And so by that, I mean, a single output of

7
00:00:37.844 --> 00:00:42.661
a template versus all of the templates for

8
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:47.476
a single or for
a collection of entities is

9
00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:52.170
ultimately just a matter of iterating.

10
00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.838
And so
if we go to our layer generator start,

11
00:01:00.838 --> 00:01:06.441
we are going to see how to do this.

12
00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:11.894
And what you'll see here
is you start to poke into

13
00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:17.214
this is that it's kind of
almost where I left off

14
00:01:17.214 --> 00:01:24.470
last time in the sense of we
now have more than one schema.

15
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.450
And within that now we can group
these together into a domain.

16
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.788
So, for
the sake of conversation semantically,

17
00:01:37.788 --> 00:01:44.659
let's say that a domain is
a collection of entities or schemas.

18
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.844
And then from here, the question

19
00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:56.681
is how would we generate a layer?

20
00:01:56.681 --> 00:02:02.270
So how would we generate a service layer?

21
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.700
How would we generate a state layer?

22
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.480
Well, we know how to generate and
iterate a single template.

23
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.680
What would it take for us to generate
more than one of those things?

24
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.400
Well, if we go up into our generate layer

25
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.340
function, yes, this is a function.

26
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.457
It's just as a placeholder and right now,

27
00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:43.729
we can update this to do something.

28
00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:47.460
And that is we are going
to take a generator.

29
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.319
So a generator works on at the layer and
the domain,

30
00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.220
which is a collection of entities or
schemas.

31
00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.340
And we're going to
iterate over that domain.

32
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.560
And for every entity,
we're going to generate a template.

33
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.668
So we're just taking
a very simple thing and

34
00:03:07.668 --> 00:03:11.690
we're just iterating on it
to create a larger thing.

35
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.630
So from here, let's go with,

36
00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:23.624
Domain reduce, and
we're going to go with code and

37
00:03:23.624 --> 00:03:27.841
we know that every time it iterates,

38
00:03:27.841 --> 00:03:33.570
what we're actually getting
is a schema object.

39
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.611
And then from here,
we're going to Update our code.

40
00:03:44.603 --> 00:03:47.700
And I'm gonna just put a placeholder
here for just a moment.

41
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.571
And then we're going to return code.

42
00:03:54.652 --> 00:03:59.300
And within here,
we're gonna pass in an empty string.

43
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.860
And so the magic is going to happen here.

44
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.774
So what I'm gonna do is because

45
00:04:08.774 --> 00:04:12.743
I foolishly deleted it,

46
00:04:12.743 --> 00:04:21.070
is we're gonna go code
class language typescript.

47
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.652
And then I'll close this out.

48
00:04:29.361 --> 00:04:33.020
And we need to generate
something in between this.

49
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.760
So this is kind of like a string sandwich.

50
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.570
So we're going to take our generator,
whatever that is.

51
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.380
So this is the beauty of this, so
I can even type this it's a generator

52
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.152
And I could type it, but

53
00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:59.870
I'm gonna not type it because it
would distract me for just a moment.

54
00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.820
So we'll go generator and

55
00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.728
then we're going to go
generate good times come on.

56
00:05:08.728 --> 00:05:14.761
And we're gonna just pass in schema,
config and

57
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:20.059
what this is going to
return is a template or

58
00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:25.368
this is what we want to render, template.

59
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:30.910
All right, I'm kind of nervous,
kind of excited.

60
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.620
But let's see what happens
when we open up this window.

61
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.970
All right, let me do this in
a standalone window so we can see it.

62
00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.758
So now what we have is, courses,

63
00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:54.888
services, lessons, services and

64
00:05:54.888 --> 00:05:58.834
assignments, services.

65
00:05:58.834 --> 00:06:05.300
And what if we wanted to
generate the state layer?

66
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.474
Well, let's go active.

67
00:06:08.474 --> 00:06:13.689
Dive inner HTML equals

68
00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.080
generate layer and

69
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.667
we'll go reducer generator

70
00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:30.986
and/or domain, config.

71
00:06:30.986 --> 00:06:33.410
All right,
how long did it take me to type that line?

72
00:06:35.156 --> 00:06:37.320
I don't know, like 10 seconds maybe.

73
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.820
And so we'll save this and

74
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.350
let me just delineate this here.

75
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.941
So this is where I'm getting
paid by the hour, and

76
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:54.930
I realized that I'm working too fast.

77
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.870
And so I need to slow my roll
to justify my timesheet.

78
00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.680
I'm just kidding.

79
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:03.670
So now, let's flip back over here.

80
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.020
And data layer,
all the way down to the state layer.

81
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.660
How long did that take?

82
00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:20.097
Well, hardly any at all,

83
00:07:20.097 --> 00:07:25.410
any time at all, but more importantly,

84
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:31.814
what did it take me in terms
of effort to go from and

85
00:07:31.814 --> 00:07:35.894
I'm just gonna open this up and

86
00:07:41.408 --> 00:07:45.310
From a template, I guess we're
doing more than one template.

87
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:54.997
What did it take to go from here where
I'm doing them one by one to this,

88
00:07:54.997 --> 00:07:59.389
where it's generating it all at once?

89
00:08:05.354 --> 00:08:10.080
It took me exactly, well, seven lines of

90
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.950
code I believe [INAUDIBLE]
7 lines of code.

91
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:21.048
So I went from generating a cell or

92
00:08:21.048 --> 00:08:25.840
a template to a layer
in seven lines of code.

93
00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.590
And all we're doing is
defining our schemas,

94
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.058
putting them into an array, looping over,

95
00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:44.090
reducing it into an output that
we're then putting on to the screen.

96
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:53.990
So from here again Let's
go with challenges.

97
00:08:55.643 --> 00:08:57.210
Now start the timer.

98
00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:03.650
We've just realized that,
we're gonna add in a new feature.

99
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.910
And we're gonna have
the ability to do challenges.

100
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.130
Okay, that's awesome.

101
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.403
And how soon can we have something ready

102
00:09:15.403 --> 00:09:19.330
to demo for the stakeholders?

103
00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:26.209
Well, notice, I've defined a schema and

104
00:09:26.209 --> 00:09:30.050
I've just added it into my domain.

105
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:37.040
And if I come back here,
now I have a challenges service.

106
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:41.890
And if I go to the bottom I
have a challenges reducer.

107
00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:44.100
How long did that take me?

108
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.783
Not very long because I'm thinking
not about building one widget,

109
00:09:51.783 --> 00:09:56.329
I'm thinking about
building 10,000 of them.

110
00:09:56.329 --> 00:10:02.066
And so this is the difference of
moving from wiggling something by

111
00:10:02.066 --> 00:10:08.450
hand with a pocket knife to plastic
injection molding on an assembly line
