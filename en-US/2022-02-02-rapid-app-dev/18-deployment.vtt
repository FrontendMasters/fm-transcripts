00:00:00.132 --> 00:00:05.594
Now, this is going to
actually kind of feed

2
00:00:05.594 --> 00:00:10.601
into the next part of that question is,

3
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:16.999
from conception,
how do we get into deployment?

4
00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:22.490
And so I'm going to give you some hints,

5
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.688
one with the CLI that using NX,

6
00:00:26.688 --> 00:00:30.887
you can generate nest entire,

7
00:00:30.887 --> 00:00:34.780
an entire API very quickly.

8
00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.682
And so there's a lot of things that
you can a lot of mileage you can get

9
00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:40.715
from the CLI.

10
00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:48.139
In addition to that I want to show
you one really quick example,

11
00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:52.902
and kind of gonna lay some groundwork for

12
00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:58.085
you to kind of think
about like how would we,

13
00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:03.014
how could I extend this So
this is the CLI.

14
00:01:03.014 --> 00:01:08.295
You saw here that I had
to basically copy this.

15
00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:13.822
Well, what you can do
with a little bit of luck

16
00:01:13.822 --> 00:01:19.204
my fair lady is not even
a little bit of luck,

17
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:23.284
like five minutes worth of work.

18
00:01:23.284 --> 00:01:29.006
You can essentially add functionality
to copy this, or to create a button you

19
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:34.649
can click, which will then put whatever
it is you have on to your clipboard.

20
00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:41.605
Or whatever element that you
have attached a button to so

21
00:01:41.605 --> 00:01:49.608
in this case I am attaching
clipboard js which is NPM clipboard.

22
00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:57.062
Super cool, although just with
a warning was real quick, ha, no flash.

23
00:01:57.062 --> 00:02:01.760
All right, now with clipboard in place,

24
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.067
I have a small file here, so
check this out in the blitz,

25
00:02:08.067 --> 00:02:13.055
but I am basically
saying a knit clipboard.

26
00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:20.195
I'm sending in a selector, it's saying
everything that matches this go ahead and

27
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:24.280
attach this clipboard
functionality to this.

28
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:30.744
Super simple,
again I feel like most everything we've

29
00:02:30.744 --> 00:02:36.382
done up to this point
has been like level 100,

30
00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:40.243
maybe 120 level JavaScript.

31
00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:45.639
And so within our index thirty years,

32
00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.521
if we go down to the bottom.

33
00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:58.818
I'm still doing all of my regular
stuff but now what I'm doing is,

34
00:02:58.818 --> 00:03:03.580
I'm saying I'm instantiating
clipboard I'm saying

35
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.525
a knit clipboard and
I'm passing in button.

36
00:03:07.525 --> 00:03:12.085
And so within the generated code,
what I have is

37
00:03:12.085 --> 00:03:16.987
a button that is targeting
an element in this case,

38
00:03:16.987 --> 00:03:20.644
the CLI, data clipboard target CLI.

39
00:03:20.644 --> 00:03:28.275
And so when I run this,
I can go ahead and,

40
00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.284
I'm going to copy this and

41
00:03:35.284 --> 00:03:42.505
if we come in here,
I can just paste this in,

42
00:03:42.505 --> 00:03:46.814
and so this is very handy.

43
00:03:46.814 --> 00:03:51.905
So, that's the first step,
is you can just create a button that

44
00:03:51.905 --> 00:03:56.998
you can then allow yourself to then
copy this to the clipboard and

45
00:03:56.998 --> 00:04:01.265
paste it in, so
that's one little convenient step.

46
00:04:01.265 --> 00:04:09.893
Now one of the things that I did not do
because this is framework dependent is,

47
00:04:09.893 --> 00:04:15.070
I think it's NGIX file saver,
is an uncertain

48
00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.608
there is a react equivalent is
that using NGIX file saver.

49
00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:26.764
It's not hard to have a adjacent download

50
00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:31.625
button that allows you to download this

51
00:04:31.625 --> 00:04:36.942
file as a text file to
your local computer.

52
00:04:36.942 --> 00:04:41.920
On top of that, you could
absolutely have some functionality

53
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.909
to wrap this up into a zip file,
download it and go from there.

54
00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.944
So, I am going to leave it
to your imagination, but

55
00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:58.633
here is one example of how do we
streamline the workflow out of this.

56
00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:05.902
And so clipboard file saver and
being able to zip something up and

57
00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:11.697
then save it is kind of that
next iteration of that.

58
00:05:11.697 --> 00:05:14.794
In the example that I showed
you at the beginning,

59
00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:19.163
I actually don't download two zips
that has all the generated files.

60
00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:24.781
On zip one, put the base file in,
run a command and it just does everything.

61
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:30.312
And so again, I don't want to
spoon feed everything to you,

62
00:05:30.312 --> 00:05:37.266
but at the same time, I want to give you
some hints on where you can take this.

63
00:05:37.266 --> 00:05:43.952
And then you can create a version
of this that you see fit.
