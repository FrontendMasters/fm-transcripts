00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.526
If you noticed,
I wrote one property object,

2
00:00:05.526 --> 00:00:09.546
and then I basically copied it down,

3
00:00:09.546 --> 00:00:14.150
went through, and I replaced it.

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.888
And so, in my opinion, code snippets

5
00:00:18.888 --> 00:00:23.930
are the Hello World of code generation.

6
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.476
And so, what I wanna do is
I am going to attempt to

7
00:00:28.476 --> 00:00:33.027
actually convert what I've done,
the props,

8
00:00:33.027 --> 00:00:36.650
into a code snippet that I can reuse.

9
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.785
And so, this to me is, I think, most
people, they start to use code snippet.

10
00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:47.593
Certainly, I know there's a ton of
libraries of like Angular snippets and

11
00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:50.460
React snippets and Ionic snippets.

12
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.129
And what you're going to see is
what these individuals are doing.

13
00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.505
They're basically taking this approach and

14
00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:03.224
turning it into a package that
then gets installed as a plugin.

15
00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:07.678
So, you'll notice here that, again,

16
00:01:07.678 --> 00:01:12.001
I went through and I just copied this and

17
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:17.765
I pasted it in three more times,
and went through and

18
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:21.714
changed the stuff that I needed to.

19
00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:26.663
Well, what you can do in VS Code is that

20
00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:30.690
you can create a code snippet.

21
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.827
And so, in the case of StackBlitz,
you can go into your snippets here and

22
00:01:37.827 --> 00:01:42.737
just, So there's no surprise here.

23
00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:47.855
I've already done this, but I'm going to

24
00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:52.980
do it again, so
you can see how this works.

25
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.736
And so this is just a JSON file, and

26
00:01:56.736 --> 00:02:01.080
we're going to create a new snippet.

27
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.980
And so we're going to really
generate a props schema.

28
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.308
Cuz the one thing that I did notice is,

29
00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:15.469
it's really tedious,
if I have an interface,

30
00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:21.100
to have to convert it into
the schema over, and over, and over.

31
00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.923
I feel like there should be a way to
streamline this, at least, a little bit.

32
00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:33.350
So, from here,
We'll just add in our scope.

33
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.484
And I'm just doing this all by hand,
I mean, how far do you wanna take this?

34
00:02:40.484 --> 00:02:42.480
We could write a code generator.

35
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.978
And I'm gonna go fem, for
Frontend Masters, props,

36
00:02:48.978 --> 00:02:52.230
and now we're going to do our body.

37
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.897
Now, this is where things
get a little funny,

38
00:02:56.897 --> 00:03:00.368
and I think where snippets can be,

39
00:03:00.368 --> 00:03:06.050
at least setting them up,
can become a bit tedious.

40
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.864
But notice, speaking of molds,
I'm taking an instance

41
00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:16.460
of the real thing, and
this is what I'm starting with.

42
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.645
And so, from here, what I'm gonna do,

43
00:03:19.645 --> 00:03:25.389
is I'm just going to do a vertical
selection here, and I'm going to go,

44
00:03:27.112 --> 00:03:31.205
Double quote, Double quote.

45
00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:35.719
And I'll go back here, add this in, oops,

46
00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:43.237
the one thing I should have done,
Is I forgot to put in a comma.

47
00:03:43.237 --> 00:03:48.937
So we go comma here, and
then we ask ourselves,

48
00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:52.795
so, this is really important.

49
00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:55.050
What do we need to change?

50
00:03:57.153 --> 00:04:00.274
Well, we need to change this, and so

51
00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:04.720
what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna put a 1 here.

52
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.224
Let's assume for
now everything is an input,

53
00:04:10.224 --> 00:04:13.193
but we'll put a 2 here.

54
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.732
We'll put a 3 here, so, there's three
things basically I wanna change.

55
00:04:22.732 --> 00:04:27.325
And just to round things off,
then I'm going to put a 0.

56
00:04:27.325 --> 00:04:32.359
And I actually don't think, well,
now I need to make a decision.

57
00:04:32.359 --> 00:04:35.158
Do I put labels on these or not?

58
00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:37.673
I'm gonna just go with not.

59
00:04:37.673 --> 00:04:43.470
So, I think I can just take these off and
hopefully this works.

60
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.640
But, notice,
I pasted in a real Props object.

61
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.681
And then I went through, I pulled out
the pieces that I wanted to change, or

62
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:59.780
make dynamic, and
I replaced them with something else.

63
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.741
So, this is what I'm talking about when
you make a mold, it looks like the real

64
00:05:03.741 --> 00:05:08.140
thing, but there's some additional tooling
so that you can accommodate a workflow.

65
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.876
So let me save this, and let's go back and

66
00:05:14.876 --> 00:05:19.306
let's see if this worked.

67
00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:23.709
fem-props, ooh,

68
00:05:23.709 --> 00:05:27.076
and, for key,

69
00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:32.000
let's go with notes.

70
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.450
Notes, add in some notes, and

71
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.942
I'll tab out, and, ta-da.

72
00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:45.796
I forgot something.

73
00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:51.163
Let me go here, fem-props, and

74
00:05:51.163 --> 00:06:00.450
let's go with miscellaneous because
I am running out of creativity.

75
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:04.474
Enter something random, tab, and

76
00:06:04.474 --> 00:06:10.250
then what we can do is just
make these not required.

77
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.560
So, I'm gonna just cut these out,
and there we have it.

78
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.160
So, this may have seemed like
a very simple thing, but

79
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.070
what you have seen is a very kind of,
is a microcosm.

80
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.599
Is this idea of,
see the real thing, pick it up,

81
00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:34.790
capture it,
pull out the things that you wanna change,

82
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:40.430
immortalize it, cast it in plaster,
and then use it later.
