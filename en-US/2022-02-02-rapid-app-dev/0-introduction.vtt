00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.480
Welcome to RAD patterns.

2
00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.120
And by RAD I mean rapid
application development.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.690
Let's talk about this narrative
arc we're gonna go on today.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.690
So we're gonna start out with a primer.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.520
And we're just gonna write some very,
very basic JavaScript.

6
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.620
So to be rapid, to achieve rapid
application development enlightenment,

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.160
just how much JavaScript
do we need to know?

8
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.420
And, then we're gonna
lead into a big idea.

9
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.116
And, there's something that I believe
the most important thing that

10
00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:42.390
if we walk away from today,
I will be very happy.

11
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.770
And so what is the big idea?

12
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.390
Stay tuned.

13
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.660
Then we're going to talk
about architecture.

14
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.130
How do we need to think about architecture
for rapid application development to work?

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.632
And if you're sitting here thinking, well,
you're using that super RAD term, but

16
00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:02.500
I don't know what that means.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.950
Don't worry, we'll unpack that.

18
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.301
And then we'll talk about domain models,
live templates, string manipulation,

19
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.690
which is where all the magic happens.

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.781
And then we're going to
get into generators, and

21
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:17.830
by generators, I mean money printers.

22
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.190
And so I want to ask a question.

23
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.277
So, everybody grab your coffee,
your hot chocolate,

24
00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:32.937
let's cozy up by the fire and
let's think about this for a second.

25
00:01:32.937 --> 00:01:38.497
Is it possible that you
could build applications

26
00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:43.115
ten times faster than you are right now?

27
00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:46.240
So I'm just gonna let that sit for
a second.

28
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.800
And just think, is it possible for
me to be ten times faster?

29
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.191
Now, what I want to then ask is what would

30
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:02.370
that mean for your career as a developer?

31
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.870
What would that mean for
your organization?

32
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.580
And everybody that benefits from your
livelihood as a software engineer?

33
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.511
So it's one thing to say,
could this happen, could it be?

34
00:02:15.511 --> 00:02:21.254
But then when you start to think about,
well, what is the, instead of output,

35
00:02:21.254 --> 00:02:26.228
shifting and reframing it to outcome,
what would be the outcome of us

36
00:02:26.228 --> 00:02:31.780
learning how to be three times,
five times, ten times faster?

37
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.917
And so this is the goal for today,

38
00:02:34.917 --> 00:02:39.510
is that I want to make
a very strong case that yes,

39
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.697
you can be ten times faster,
I'm going to show you how to do that.

40
00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:50.594
More importantly,
is I want to show you how

41
00:02:50.594 --> 00:02:55.500
to think about code to
be ten times faster.

42
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.046
And so, with that, I want to show you,

43
00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:04.525
just peel back the curtain just a bit and
show you the wizard,

44
00:03:04.525 --> 00:03:09.798
show you the end game of where
somebody could go with this.

45
00:03:09.798 --> 00:03:11.763
And then I'm gonna close that curtain.

46
00:03:11.763 --> 00:03:16.165
And we're gonna talk about how to
achieve this in your own work.

47
00:03:16.165 --> 00:03:20.454
So what I have here is an application and
I call it, lovingly,

48
00:03:20.454 --> 00:03:24.598
PROTOGEN, it'll probably never
see the light of the day.

49
00:03:24.598 --> 00:03:31.090
But this is a permutation of
where we can go with this.

50
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.874
So imagine, I take a project and
in this project,

51
00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:41.154
I have courses, lessons and users.

52
00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:48.280
And I'm able to select the entities or
the schemas that I want.

53
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.576
And from here,

54
00:03:49.576 --> 00:03:55.470
I can generate the CLI command that
will generate the entire project.

55
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.540
I can even generate some mock JSON data.

56
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.085
I can generate services,
selectors, whatever you want,

57
00:04:08.085 --> 00:04:12.525
that you can see that
there's actually a number of

58
00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:16.986
layers here of the things
that we could generate.

59
00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:20.550
In fact,
if I wanted to do this in GraphQL,

60
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:25.500
I could select this and
now I have a GraphQL version of this.

61
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.690
And on top of that, what I can do
is I can click this, I can copy it.

62
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.021
Now it's on my clipboard, or

63
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:42.830
I could even click Download and save this.

64
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.912
And so this is a shell file.sh.

65
00:04:45.912 --> 00:04:51.640
And so that's why I said,
be careful, but we can do that.

66
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.255
And so this is a permutation
of where we can take this and

67
00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:03.150
I have used this to kick
start a number of projects.

68
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.966
And the impetus for
this particular workshop comes

69
00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:12.782
from a conversation that I
had with Gleb Bob Mataf,

70
00:05:12.782 --> 00:05:16.360
who is the lead engineer of Cypress.

71
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.923
So I think that when it
comes to end-to-end testing,

72
00:05:19.923 --> 00:05:25.043
that I think Cypress has absolutely
changed the game, moving from Selenium.

73
00:05:25.043 --> 00:05:28.804
And I have massive respect for Gleb.

74
00:05:28.804 --> 00:05:35.695
And I was showing him this particular tool
to get feedback and he asked me, he said,

75
00:05:35.695 --> 00:05:41.590
this is really awesome, but
are you going to open source it?

76
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.595
And my response was, I don't think
I will ever open source this,

77
00:05:46.595 --> 00:05:53.240
but I would be happy to show somebody
how to build their own version of this.

78
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.520
And it was when I said that,
the seed was planted for this workshop.

79
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.327
And so from here, we are going to
first talk about the mindset and

80
00:06:03.327 --> 00:06:08.910
the architecture that you have to
achieve to do something like this.

81
00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.949
And then we're gonna get very,
very tactical and start to build

82
00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.848
some very sharp, very tiny, very
effective tools to make this a reality.
