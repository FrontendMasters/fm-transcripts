00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.940
And now, since we've laid this foundation
with the primer, here's the big idea.

2
00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.314
After 20 years of programming,
I realized that I've

3
00:00:10.314 --> 00:00:16.844
essentially been doing the same
four things over and over and over.

4
00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:26.035
Describing things,
performing actions, making decisions,

5
00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:31.320
and then repeating these
particular actions over and

6
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.381
over and over with iteration.

7
00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:41.060
And so I realized that programming
in its fundamental basis,

8
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.133
data structures, functions,
conditionals, and iterators.

9
00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:54.157
Or, as I like to think of it, is just
nouns, verbs, conditionals, and iterators.

10
00:00:54.157 --> 00:01:01.328
And I had realized that I've been
doing these particular things or

11
00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:09.796
working with these particular things with
ease since I was a very small child.

12
00:01:09.796 --> 00:01:14.955
And when this hit me,
I realized and I started to think

13
00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:20.343
about the arc that I went on
in terms of skill acquisition

14
00:01:20.343 --> 00:01:25.733
that I spent 20 years programming and
programming and

15
00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:31.142
programming and
programming to arrive at a place that,

16
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:37.939
Essentially was almost where I started.

17
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.580
And I began to think about
other areas in my life

18
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.699
where this particular
pattern started to emerge.

19
00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:52.411
And I thought about martial arts,
I thought about skateboarding,

20
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:57.966
I thought about everything that I've
ever done in terms of skill acquisition.

21
00:01:57.966 --> 00:02:03.993
And I realized that mastery
is not a cumulative,

22
00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:09.432
that true mastery is reductive, that you,

23
00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:14.577
over time, are reducing a complex domain

24
00:02:14.577 --> 00:02:19.294
into its most simple and basic parts.

25
00:02:19.294 --> 00:02:25.098
And I think that to a point, if you've
ever participated in an activity with

26
00:02:25.098 --> 00:02:31.465
somebody who's really, really good, and
you ask them like, how did you do that?

27
00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:32.794
Let's say you're playing music.

28
00:02:32.794 --> 00:02:34.041
What did you just do there?

29
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.129
I don't know,

30
00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.253
I just I did it because something has
been reduced to peer muscle memory.

31
00:02:40.253 --> 00:02:45.730
So in the skill acquisition
matrix is that at the far end,

32
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.210
you have unconscious competent,
that you reduce things

33
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.164
to such a point that cognitively
is barely even registering.

34
00:02:57.164 --> 00:03:02.465
And so with that in mind,
I realized that after I reduced everything

35
00:03:02.465 --> 00:03:07.681
that I'd done in programming for
20 years to these four things.

36
00:03:07.681 --> 00:03:13.026
I realized most small children,
they are familiar with these concepts.

37
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:16.666
And so let's do a quick thought exercise.

38
00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:22.156
If I showed you three trays of donuts,
we have a blue tray,

39
00:03:22.156 --> 00:03:26.425
a green tray, and
let's say an orange tray.

40
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:31.626
And we have three trays
of donuts on a table, and

41
00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:37.230
I said to a child,
do you see those trays of donuts?

42
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.960
Do you see the green tray?

43
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:47.527
On that tray, find all the donuts
that have sprinkles on them.

44
00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:50.275
Bring them back to me.

45
00:03:50.275 --> 00:03:56.817
Is there anything in this
statement that is mysterious,

46
00:03:56.817 --> 00:04:04.328
hard to understand that most
children would not be able to parse?

47
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:10.722
And I feel like probably not,
especially in regards to my kids.

48
00:04:10.722 --> 00:04:15.893
If there were donuts on a table that
this would almost be less of a pull

49
00:04:15.893 --> 00:04:21.610
based transaction or more of a push
based transaction that they would go and

50
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.267
find the donuts and consume them.

51
00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:30.569
But here, we realize that
these are some very digestible

52
00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.962
commands that even small
children understand.

53
00:04:35.962 --> 00:04:40.513
And so in terms of code, select the tray.

54
00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:46.832
Well, trays.find and
you loop over the tray.

55
00:04:46.832 --> 00:04:52.346
So again, we're talking about
a collection, which is a form of a noun.

56
00:04:52.346 --> 00:04:58.629
And we're iterating over it and
we're evaluating is the tray color green?

57
00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:04.277
If it is, then the trays are sitting,
you're saying, shall I stay or shall I go.

58
00:05:04.277 --> 00:05:06.553
If I go, there'll be trouble.

59
00:05:06.553 --> 00:05:08.359
If I stay, there will be double.

60
00:05:08.359 --> 00:05:12.421
And so that's one of my favorite
conditionals ever, but we're saying,

61
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:14.791
if this is green, you're coming with me.

62
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:20.234
And then now you have a selected tray
that has donuts, another collection.

63
00:05:20.234 --> 00:05:24.504
We're filtering them out and we're saying,
does this donut have sprinkles?

64
00:05:24.504 --> 00:05:30.174
If yes, we set it aside and we are
creating a new array of sprinkled donuts,

65
00:05:30.174 --> 00:05:35.762
and the best function in the world,
child.fetch(sprinkleDonuts).

66
00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.104
And so this is the big idea.

67
00:05:42.104 --> 00:05:50.422
Drumroll [SOUND] our goal
is not to learn more.

68
00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:56.481
My goal here today is not to
just heap on new knowledge,

69
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:00.185
new principles, new concepts.

70
00:06:00.185 --> 00:06:03.864
But rather, it's not to learn more, but

71
00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:08.822
to gain a deeper understanding
of what we already know.

72
00:06:08.822 --> 00:06:14.176
And so this is where,
as we start on a journey with any kind

73
00:06:14.176 --> 00:06:19.433
of skill acquisition,
it's accumulative by nature.

74
00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:23.448
And as we start to gain mastery,

75
00:06:23.448 --> 00:06:31.033
what we start to realize is that
we don't have to learn more,

76
00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:36.563
we need to understand
what we already know.

77
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:41.713
And so this is the highest
possible principle that

78
00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:49.327
I can lay out today is that our goal
is to not necessarily learn new things.

79
00:06:49.327 --> 00:06:54.303
But I want to present things in such a way
to help you gain a deeper understanding of

80
00:06:54.303 --> 00:06:55.633
what you already know
