1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.152
Yeah, so, just a quick comment came
in about Feynman I believe we're

2
00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:10.368
talking about Richard Feynman who is
I think, is set forth a blueprint for

3
00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:14.426
anybody who aspires to achieve
mastery with any domain.

4
00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:19.788
He is phenomenal, I also recommend and
ironically somebody said,

5
00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:25.066
you should learn how to draw basic
diagrams, and I totally agree.

6
00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:31.216
Keynote is my favorite, and
I've spent a lot of time drawing diagrams.

7
00:00:31.216 --> 00:00:34.797
This is a totally random comment,
but Edward Tufte,

8
00:00:34.797 --> 00:00:39.335
is kinda one of the godfathers of
informational representation and

9
00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:45.490
visualization, and I think that the stuff
that he's done is absolutely fascinating.

10
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.468
So, there was a question that
came in on a few chats if

11
00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:54.654
I was going to talk about call and
apply, and

12
00:00:54.654 --> 00:01:01.669
I have an example on if you look into
the stack blitzes on event storming and

13
00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:06.760
there is a piece of code in
there where I do use apply and

14
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.522
I will comment on that when I get there.

15
00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:15.810
So, the question is in a business context,
how do I lead the conversation

16
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.859
when it comes to throwing away
the prototype versus productizing it.

17
00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:26.748
And I would say one, the business case for

18
00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:32.299
building the right thing is airtight,

19
00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.187
that it does not take
too much logic to make

20
00:01:38.187 --> 00:01:45.609
a case that we should build
things that people want.

21
00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.433
And so, first of all,
you have to establish that and

22
00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:57.560
a lot of times I've had to reduce what
is a very emotional conversation into,

23
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:03.483
are you telling me that you
are willing to invest organizational

24
00:02:03.483 --> 00:02:09.426
resources to build something that
our users may not care about?

25
00:02:09.426 --> 00:02:12.118
And so, most people are like, no, no way.

26
00:02:12.118 --> 00:02:13.870
That's what I'm saying.

27
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.036
And so I said,

28
00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:20.392
when it behoove us to ensure that
we are building the right thing.

29
00:02:20.392 --> 00:02:21.661
And so first of all,

30
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:26.821
I believe a lot of times even conversation
sometimes can get emotional when in fact

31
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:31.753
the two people on each side of the table
they want the same thing which is to build

32
00:02:31.753 --> 00:02:36.741
things that people love Is just becoming
aligned on how that's going to look.

33
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.523
And so that one,
the conversation has to be like,

34
00:02:40.523 --> 00:02:46.390
are we committed to building
something that people care about?

35
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.150
Secondly, are we committed
to doing it the right way?

36
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.261
And on the flip side is engineers that I
am going to, hopefully in this workshop,

37
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:02.385
help you close that delta
between this is prototype code,

38
00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:08.868
this is production code to where if
I'm doing a high fidelity prototype,

39
00:03:08.868 --> 00:03:14.014
there's absolutely no reason
why I couldn't launch it.

40
00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:18.972
Because I endeavor to write my
prototypes to the same standards that I

41
00:03:18.972 --> 00:03:23.585
would write any other code,
the reason why would throw it away is

42
00:03:23.585 --> 00:03:27.706
because it's immutable and
I need a another iteration.

43
00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:33.076
And I think it would actually,
it would be interesting for

44
00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:37.570
organizations that are I
would say very rigid and

45
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.186
stuck in their ways to start treating or

46
00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:46.227
adopting more of a prototype
mindset in the sense of how

47
00:03:46.227 --> 00:03:51.730
do we iterate fast and
push things out to our customer base.

48
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.775
So, a company's ability to take an idea,
and

49
00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:57.970
put it in front of a potential customer.

50
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.332
That the time that it takes to do that,
and

51
00:04:00.332 --> 00:04:04.800
a company's ability to shorten that is
its greatest competitive advantage.

52
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.365
So, one, the conversation is,
at the end of the day,

53
00:04:09.365 --> 00:04:13.157
we're saving time and we're saving money.

54
00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:16.490
The next question that
is how do we do that?

55
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.378
And one of the mindsets around rapid
prototyping that I want to address, is

56
00:04:21.378 --> 00:04:26.733
that prototypes are substandard that they
should be thrown away, and the answers

57
00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:31.564
I believe when you do them correctly,
they don't have to be thrown away.

58
00:04:31.564 --> 00:04:36.183
When you reach an iteration that you like,
keep that iteration and

59
00:04:36.183 --> 00:04:41.310
it's comes down to just a slightly
different approach to architecture.

60
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.933
The question is,
when you are reducing effort and

61
00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:51.390
I think time to build a prototype or
an artifact.

62
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.692
How do you measure that
in a meaningful way?

63
00:04:54.692 --> 00:05:01.474
If that's, if I understand that correctly,
is that when you are communicating, like,

64
00:05:01.474 --> 00:05:06.664
Hey, I want to try this, by what
metrics can we use to validate that?

65
00:05:06.664 --> 00:05:11.442
And this is a little bit science,
a little bit art,

66
00:05:11.442 --> 00:05:16.444
but I think ultimately
organizations should, one,

67
00:05:16.444 --> 00:05:22.022
keep track of how long it takes for
an idea from conception.

68
00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:27.200
So, the time from conception to
production is really important.

69
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.694
So, this is where you have to have a good
relationship with the product team and

70
00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:36.774
as well as the architecture,
the infrastructure teams,

71
00:05:36.774 --> 00:05:40.960
how long does it take for
an idea to get put into production?

72
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.540
And you need to keep track of that.

73
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:51.989
Secondly, is you need to keep track of
the things that we have in production.

74
00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:55.370
What is the engagement around
these particular features?

75
00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.397
And so, one, if you built in,
if you go read the lean startup and

76
00:06:00.397 --> 00:06:05.055
there's tons of books on this,
that if you spent six months

77
00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:10.086
building something, and
it should have taken 12 months, but

78
00:06:10.086 --> 00:06:15.061
you did it in six months and
nobody uses it, was that a victory?

79
00:06:15.061 --> 00:06:17.000
Did you actually accomplish anything?

80
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.549
And the answer's no.

81
00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:23.571
And so, ultimately,
at the end of the day, we as programmers,

82
00:06:23.571 --> 00:06:27.291
we exist to build things
that are meaningful and

83
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:30.644
have an impact and are relevant to people.

84
00:06:30.644 --> 00:06:35.339
This is why program, I don't think about
languages, I don't think about frameworks.

85
00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:36.558
What I think about is,

86
00:06:36.558 --> 00:06:41.430
can I put something in somebody's hands
that's going to make their life better?

87
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.090
Am I going to reduce pain?

88
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.172
Am I going to help them
do something faster?

89
00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:49.155
Even am I going to introduce
some level of novelty?

90
00:06:49.155 --> 00:06:55.139
So, the example I use, is if you've ever
been to a restaurant and one of your kids

91
00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.331
is just having a fit and you pull up
a silly 99 cent game on your phone,

92
00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:05.187
and you hand it to him, and
all of a sudden now they're pacified.

93
00:07:05.187 --> 00:07:08.601
Somebody willing to be like, well,
that little balloon game, that's silly,

94
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:09.914
that's not even worth doing.

95
00:07:09.914 --> 00:07:13.651
But in that moment,
not only is it relevant to you, but

96
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:16.430
every other patron in that restaurant.

97
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.548
And so, it's really, really important
to realize that we're not centered or

98
00:07:22.548 --> 00:07:26.839
we don't exist for output,
we exist for outcomes, and

99
00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:31.062
what outcomes are we achieving
at the business level?

100
00:07:31.062 --> 00:07:34.451
And so,
a great way to I think to measure that is,

101
00:07:34.451 --> 00:07:37.420
what is the engagement on your products?

102
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.286
Do people love them?

103
00:07:40.286 --> 00:07:41.443
And secondly,

104
00:07:41.443 --> 00:07:46.881
is how long does it take from an idea
to go from conception to production?

105
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:52.450
And from there, there's a ton of things
that you can slice up to to measure that.

106
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.886
So, hopefully that answered your question.

107
00:07:55.886 --> 00:07:59.381
It is going to vary a little bit from
organization to organization, but

108
00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:02.353
those are the two I think really
really important things is,

109
00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:05.120
do people like what you're building?

110
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.250
And how long does it take to conceive
something and then build that thing?

111
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.750
And companies that are very,
very good at this, they are constantly

112
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:18.500
putting things in front of people that
they love and they keep buying it.

113
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.150
I think Apple is a really
good example of this.

114
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.420
Most of their releases are iterative.

115
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:29.220
But, they have a way of building
things that people love.

116
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.008
I would say halfway through my
career when I realized that,

117
00:08:33.008 --> 00:08:37.705
I don't like code because I just love
the sound of my fingers clattering on

118
00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:40.734
the keyboard at the middle
of the night is that,

119
00:08:40.734 --> 00:08:45.930
when you build things that people love and
you actually can capture that moment.

120
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:50.062
So, at one point, I worked for Shutterfly,
and it was always interesting to me

121
00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:53.884
because I I worked for Shutterfly,
and they'd always be like,

122
00:08:53.884 --> 00:08:58.604
my mom loves Shutterfly, my girlfriend
loves Shutterfly, I love Shutterfly.

123
00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:03.876
And I didn't really get it until I
basically had to burn through some

124
00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:09.055
coupon codes and I purchased a book
that from a Grand Canyon trip and

125
00:09:09.055 --> 00:09:13.957
I'm holding this in my hands and
I was just floored that the code

126
00:09:13.957 --> 00:09:18.337
that I'd written translated
into this physical book.

127
00:09:18.337 --> 00:09:24.083
And that fundamentally changed the way
that I think about programming as

128
00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:29.827
a whole is that programming is just
a means that the end is really I think,

129
00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:36.110
a deeper connection and a really creating
value for the broader population.

130
00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:40.609
So, I know that Mark and I are very
much philosophically aligned on on this

131
00:09:40.609 --> 00:09:44.110
particular point,
which is why funding masters exist.
