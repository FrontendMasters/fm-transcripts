00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.666
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So I'm gonna do another
sort of dotted line across here just to

2
00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.046
sort of show we've now moved
on to the right hand side.

3
00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:06.475
But we're still in the same run time.

4
00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:07.529
We're still running the same code.

5
00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.061
So paid user.

6
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:15.036
I should have been less spread out.

7
00:00:15.036 --> 00:00:19.690
Paid user, creator is a function

8
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.340
definition, great, we don't do any of
the code inside of it, but we hope, when

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.010
we call that function, it's gonna give
us out an object, that's what we hope.

10
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.320
Okay, next line Chris.

11
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.720
&gt;&gt; Chris: We're creating a constant,
paid user functions.

12
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.010
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Thank you man,
yep user functions, which is an object.

13
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.640
Michael, what property do
we have on that object?

14
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.550
&gt;&gt; Michael: Increase balance.

15
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.800
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Increase
balance which is a function.

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.020
Excellent man thank you.

17
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.630
Okay so I slow down at this point cause
I want to get all these pieces right.

18
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.590
Here's our dream, people, is that I
can create a user, as a paid user.

19
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.331
Let's call it paid user one.

20
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:06.141
Here's my dream, you're probably gonna see
this in a second, but here's my dream.

21
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:12.222
That I can create an object, paid user
one, that has all properties of a user,

22
00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:16.001
like name and score,
plus a bonus property, but

23
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:21.280
has my user one would not have
access to increase balance function.

24
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.730
But my paid user one.

25
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.700
Would have access to increase balance, but
would also have access to user functions.

26
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.430
David, what might I want to add to paid
user functions such that it has a link

27
00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.830
to user functions, so
that when I go looking on this object for

28
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.770
my function using the proto-reference
on say paid user one.

29
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.270
See if I don't find something on here,
I'm gonna go and

30
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.240
look at the regular user functions.

31
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.490
What might I wanna add to this object,
how might I want to make that link?

32
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.150
&gt;&gt; David: So is that what set
prototype of this is getting after?

33
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.950
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: What property
that all objects have.

34
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.470
&gt;&gt; Chris: Proto.

35
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.280
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Proto, and proto is
the place, it's a hidden property.

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.900
It's the place where if I go, if
JavaScript goes looking on this object for

37
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.790
a method and doesn't find it,
where does it go looking, Seth?

38
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.410
&gt;&gt; Seth: In proto.

39
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:16.905
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: In proto.
Whatever, so

40
00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:20.519
it wouldn't be nice if that
proto were a link up to.

41
00:02:22.577 --> 00:02:23.088
&gt;&gt; Chris: User function.

42
00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:26.510
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Up to user functions,
exactly.

43
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.960
So that we're gonna still, come back
to you in one second, Nick, I promise.

44
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.220
So we're still gonna have a link up
to that shared set of functions.

45
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.230
But our user one, it's just gonna
link straight to the user functions.

46
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.850
They're never gonna see this stuff.

47
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.090
But we're gonna open
a moment our paid user.

48
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.840
Let's call it paid user Terry or
we call it paid user one here.

49
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.110
But they're gonna go looking for
functions first in paid user functions.

50
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.970
And if they don't find something in here,
they're not gonna panic,

51
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.410
they're gonna look up to user functions.

52
00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.320
Meaning they're gonna get access
to both the types of functions.

53
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.300
It's gonna be very nice, so how do I make
the proto link up to user functions?

54
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.616
Well I use this built-in tools
object that set prototype of which

55
00:03:08.616 --> 00:03:13.460
takes in as its first input,
its first argument an object.

56
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.079
Which one is it,
well it's this one paid user functions.

57
00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.951
And then it takes in as its second
input whatever you want to set

58
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:24.617
proto to on the first
input page of the object.

59
00:03:24.617 --> 00:03:27.655
So whatever you wanna set
the proto pages functions to,

60
00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:29.345
parse in as a second argument.

61
00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:34.170
Well, that's gonna be user functions.

62
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.470
Why not call it set proto of?

63
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.820
But why?

64
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.920
Cuz technically they call anything
that's referenced from proto

65
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.080
the prototype of this object.

66
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.660
But it's referenced through
something called proto.

67
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.690
It's profoundly confusing.

68
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.850
If there were not a property
elsewhere called prototype

69
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.360
that is something totally different, which
we saw earlier, maybe not so confusing.

70
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.059
But where there is literally property as
well as prototype, it seems crazy to me

71
00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.816
that you would say set prototype of, when
it is explicitly not setting a property

72
00:04:02.816 --> 00:04:06.097
equal prototype, is explicitly
sending a property called, proto.

73
00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:10.333
Now in the spec it technically calls this
property, even more confusingly, prototype

74
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:14.411
with two square brackets around it, which
is different to the prototype property.

75
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.100
Well, that's just ridiculous.

76
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.960
So we'll use the term proto for
it, because that is what

77
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.580
the Chrome DevTools refers to it as,
and it's become pretty standard.

78
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.787
Okay, so object of set prototype of,
takes in as its first input the object,

79
00:04:29.787 --> 00:04:34.930
pages of functions, and then says,
set its proto to the second input.

80
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.180
Which is user functions.

81
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.710
So let's just put that in here.

82
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.390
User functions.

83
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.860
So this is looking pretty nice, people.

84
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.610
We have an object here,
that has a link up to user functions.

85
00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.370
So if we now later on are gonna go
paid user one dot increase balance,

86
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.240
let's hope we can go and get it from here.

87
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.690
Paid user one dot, say, name.

88
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.810
We're not gonna find it here.

89
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.120
Hopefully we can still get it up here.

90
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.827
In other words, our paid user type or

91
00:04:58.827 --> 00:05:02.090
paid user object will still get access
to all the stuff that users had.

92
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.590
Nice.
