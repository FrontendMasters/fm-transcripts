WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.770
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: We are now
able to generate an object

2
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.100
that does not have functions on it.

3
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.460
And user 2 would be very similar,
again, with the specific data for

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.370
user 2, but no functions copied on it,
but they're still available.

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.928
This would be it.

6
00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:20.640
It'd be pretty nice, but we wanna produce
a paid user that is just like a user.

7
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.830
But a little bit more specific.

8
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.360
It has some bonus functions or it says
here has some bonus properties, but

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.400
also some bonus functions that are gonna
work on those bonus properties, perfect.

10
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.370
Let's see if we can do it.

11
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.436
Right hand side here, here we go.

12
00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:44.060
Here we go, I'm just putting this here
to show me what the right hand side.

13
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.249
Who should I call on?

14
00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.130
David, excellent help me out David.

15
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.840
We declare a class which is
really a function object combo.

16
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.070
Give me a second while I put it on here,
name paid use creator,

17
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.030
hold on, paid user

18
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:18.010
creator which is
a function plus an object.

19
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.940
Hold on.
Hold on, yeah, the extends bit.

20
00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:22.565
Shit, okay.

21
00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:24.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Now,

22
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.690
it get's interesting.

23
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.630
I'm gonna use a different colored pen for
everything that extends does.

24
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.374
Okay.

25
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.440
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Ain't got
many pens left at this point.

26
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.610
Thank you ma'am.

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.270
Should I use orange?

28
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.770
Yeah.

29
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.730
I shall only use red.

30
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.370
Yes, I quite like that sort of
complimentary to the pink for class.

31
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.242
I use red for
everything that extends is going to do.

32
00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:54.460
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay,
first let's just get the regular stuff.

33
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.210
So it's a function object combo, so
it's function is subtitled, constructor,

34
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.170
there it is, and
it has a property on its object portion,

35
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.500
prototype, we know this is our
regular stuff, which is itself

36
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.820
an object, into which we're going
to stick what function, David?

37
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Increase balance.

38
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.756
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Increase balance.

39
00:02:25.756 --> 00:02:29.290
And that's done for us now rather than
having to manually assign it there.

40
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.320
It's just done by putting it in
the class structure is the function.

41
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.110
Okay, so what does extends do?

42
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.980
Extends user creator.

43
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.520
Is going to do two major things.

44
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.940
We want any object that comes out
of running paid user creator,

45
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.460
which will be paid user one.

46
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.710
We want that paid user one to have
a bond to this set of functions.

47
00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:59.370
Well, that makes sense.

48
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.100
We know that, that's gonna happen by
using new keyword, running pages create.

49
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.010
It'll get a bond automatically to this
set of functions in the proto reference.

50
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.210
No problem.

51
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.660
But we want that, we want that object to
also have access to this set of functions.

52
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.570
So what, when it goes looking in here for
say name, do we want to happen, Seth?

53
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.892
When that object doesn't even say
name in here, doesn't find it and

54
00:03:20.892 --> 00:03:21.860
we wanted to go looking?

55
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's proto
link should link up to it.

56
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.903
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Perfect,
red means extends does it?

57
00:03:25.903 --> 00:03:31.596
So the first thing extends
does is set that proto

58
00:03:31.596 --> 00:03:38.152
as reference up to
user-creator- dot-prototype.

59
00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:39.650
No problem.

60
00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.290
We did it manually before dot-prototype.

61
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.020
We did it manually before,
if you remember.

62
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.650
Using the greater prototypes setting
the object on the prototype,

63
00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.130
replacing the whole object and

64
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.330
making it have a link to its proto
up to that user creator prototype.

65
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.090
We did manually before.

66
00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.700
Now, it extends it for us.

67
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.530
It extends, automates it for us and
the bond is made up to there.

68
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.490
With the help extends, but
extends does something else.

69
00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.820
We want to, when we run page
user creator with a new keyword,

70
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.200
we want to run the constructor portion,
that we then want it

71
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.820
to use the work we did earlier of
assigning properties in user creator,

72
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.600
is to use that to help create the object
with the right properties on it.

73
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.550
Now, remember we did that earlier.

74
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.980
We used user creator with call,
and then we assigned it this.

75
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.880
We ain't gonna need to do that anymore.

76
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.860
Now inside of the function,
the constructor bit,

77
00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.430
that when we run paid user creator,

78
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.680
create our object with the help of the new
keyword, we're gonna run super, and

79
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.480
super is gonna say go run
the user creator bit.

80
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.090
It's gonna be a little bit
finicky how it does it.

81
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.030
We're gonna see in a second.

82
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.000
The spec explains it.

83
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.460
I've only ever seen my favorite
2ality explain it explicitly.

84
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.771
Otherwise no one else explains.

85
00:05:17.793 --> 00:05:21.076
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: The super is gonna go
and take us over to the user creator and

86
00:05:21.076 --> 00:05:24.070
run it's function to create our object.

87
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.140
And by the way, unlike here, when we
made the object inside pages creator,

88
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.410
and then we mutated it one layer out,
we're actually gonna make the object,

89
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.310
wait for this.

90
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.994
We're gonna make the object
inside of user creator.

91
00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:42.550
But it's gonna have its proto auto-set
to pages creator's functions.

92
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.290
We'll see in a second.

93
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:48.591
But that means there's one other
thing that extends does, I can't.

94
00:05:50.734 --> 00:05:54.666
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: I'm not sure
I should even tell this, okay,

95
00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:58.410
it does this, it does this, it does this.

96
00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:01.342
It sets paid user creator, the function.

97
00:06:03.614 --> 00:06:05.685
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: It's proto.

98
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:17.270
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: To the user
creator function object combo.

99
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.350
To user creator,
let me just extend this down a bit here.

100
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.200
It's a joke.

101
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.910
That's true.

102
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:29.470
No, no.
No,

103
00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:36.820
please please don't all off at once at my
drink, okay as extended down slightly.

104
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:41.180
The second thing it does is we have
another property on pages of creator.

105
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:49.270
Proto that normally would just
link to function-dot-prototype,

106
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.160
where all the shared, anything that
a function has access to will be.

107
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.030
This is the moment where we go,
a-ha, and just give up.

108
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.670
But it links up to user creator.

109
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:02.010
We're gonna see what this
is gonna let us do, people.

110
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:04.902
Is that when we run paid user creator,
the function,

111
00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:07.450
it's gonna create us an object inside.

112
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:12.270
We're gonna call super, and
that super is gonna go.

113
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.200
What am I?

114
00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.340
What do I need to go and run?

115
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.710
It's gonna go look at proto,
see user creator and go and run it.

116
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.520
Creator object.

117
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.900
I promise we're gonna do it in a second
Seth, I really wanna dive into this piece.

118
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.970
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Okay I kinda wanna
extend on this piece a little bit.

119
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.680
So if you left off constructor on paid
user creator, it's gonna look in proto for

120
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.750
constructor, and
just run constructor directly.

121
00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.870
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: That's a different
factor, if you leave off constructor it's

122
00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.640
gonna automatically put in a very simple
constructor that just returns and object.

123
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.230
So look, my God.

124
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:44.490
Look at what our sub.

125
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.963
They call this a subclass, right?

126
00:07:46.963 --> 00:07:50.260
So not a base class, but a subclass.

127
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.150
Look at what it has on it.

128
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.380
Is that just from?

129
00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.080
That was just from.

130
00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.660
And everything in red
was added by extends.

131
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.410
One portion ensures that the objects
that come out of running this function

132
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.620
have access to these functions.

133
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:09.060
That's what the proto bit on
the collection of functions ensures.

134
00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:15.030
The other portion, the other consequence
of extends ensures that the super,

135
00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.110
which when we run page as a creator,
we're going to run makes us go and

136
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.130
run user creator to make the object there.

137
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.670
And that link is stored in the proto.

138
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.930
That is where it's stored.

139
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:33.572
If you overwrite proto, then the super
goes [SOUND] I'm not there anymore.

140
00:08:33.572 --> 00:08:37.089
When you call super inside of that it
is absolutely heading to proto and

141
00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:39.020
going to look up here.

142
00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.810
So if you overwrite this with null
that super ain't gonna do anything.

143
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.450
Okay, let's see it play out.

144
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.470
This is a lot of laying out,
we're gonna see it play out, and

145
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.240
that should become a little bit clearer.

146
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.870
All right, left-hand side here Chris,
what are we doing?

147
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.620
We've set up our whole paid user class,

148
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:59.500
with it is an extension of user creator,
now we're gonna declare what?

149
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A constant of paid user.

150
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.130
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah perfect of paid-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: User one.

151
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.620
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: User one,

152
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:11.940
which we don't initialize anything yet,
while we go off and call.

153
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.950
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Paid user creator.

154
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:14.730
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Paid user creator.
