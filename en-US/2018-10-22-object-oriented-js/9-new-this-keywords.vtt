00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.300
&gt;&gt; Will: Introducing the keyword
that automates all the hard work.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.210
The new keyword.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:08.230
We're gonna call,

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.860
we're gonna run our function with a new
keyword in front of it, inserted.

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.340
And that people is going to automate.

6
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.327
So we're gonna insert
a new keyword in here.

7
00:00:22.327 --> 00:00:25.200
Folks, that's gonna automate
three major things.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.980
It's gonna make our object for us.

9
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.710
No declaring it using object.create,
no no no no.

10
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.870
It's gonna make it for us.

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.890
We're not gonna have to return
the object out ourselves,

12
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.220
it's just gonna return
it out automatically.

13
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.820
The object it made.

14
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.393
We're not, hm.

15
00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:43.540
So that's saving us some work.

16
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.640
It's also creating some challenges.

17
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.300
Now we need to adjust how we
write the body of userCreator.

18
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.180
For example, how can we refer
to this auto created object,

19
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.070
before the object we created
was done manually by us?

20
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.470
We referred to it,
to add properties to it using newUser.

21
00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.340
We declared an object, newUser,
and we referred to it as newUser.

22
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.640
But if we're not gonna write that line
of code, and instead it's gonna kinda be

23
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.720
automatically inserted for us,
how are we gonna refer to it?

24
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.990
JavaScript gives us a keyword to refer
to it, Michael do you know what it is?

25
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.540
&gt;&gt; Michael: Constructor.

26
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.580
&gt;&gt; Chris: This.

27
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.150
&gt;&gt; Will: Spot on Chris,
the keyword this, exactly.

28
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.600
But also there's another challenge.

29
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.650
Whereas before, when we declared
that object, we wanted that object

30
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.710
not to require itself to have
the functions like increment and

31
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.720
login, but to have a link to them
through what hidden property, David?

32
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.550
&gt;&gt; David: Proto.
&gt;&gt; Will: Through proto.

33
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.610
But now we don't get to
make that bond ourselves.

34
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.410
That object's being made automatically and
we wanna save ourselves making that bond.

35
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.380
So where the hell are we gonna and,

36
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.960
how are we gonna make that bond
to a set of shared functions?

37
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.140
And not only that,
that set of shared functions,

38
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.750
that Object of shared functions.

39
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.770
How are we gonna make a bond to it?

40
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.629
Or alternatively, is there some place
that we can put those functions

41
00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.600
such that JavaScript will know to
automatically make the bond to them?

42
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.036
Is there some special place?

43
00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:23.390
So rather than us declare an object.

44
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.680
With a label and
make the bond to that labeled object,

45
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.020
instead java should gives us a place
where we can put those functions.

46
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.400
The all of the objects that get returned
from running user creator with the help of

47
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.310
this new keyword will automatically
get a bond to this set of functions.

48
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.390
But where can we put them do we need
to maybe create an object called?

49
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.174
I don't know like same name as
a function user creator and

50
00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:55.850
then functions or something, I don't know.

51
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.850
Where is it?
How we're gonna do it?

52
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.030
Now, we need to adjust how to
write the body user creator,

53
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.280
having regular grid object,
no problem, keyword this.

54
00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.500
But how can we know where to put
our single copies of the functions?
