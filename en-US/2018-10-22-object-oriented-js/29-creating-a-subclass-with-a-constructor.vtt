1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.930
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Now we need
to see if we can create,

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.270
still using the new keyword approach,
a paid user.

3
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.128
Paid User 1.

4
00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.940
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: This is
potentially a little bit tough.

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.300
Because, we're gonna have a new
keyword be like a hammer to hit,

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.250
you know when you use a hammer for
any task.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.180
That new keyword only does one thing.

8
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.900
Inside of paid user creator, it's gonna
create an empty object automatically with

9
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.180
a label this, that's gonna link to the
proto whatever the paid user creator is.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.300
Sorry proto of the paid
user creator.prototype.

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.070
And then it's gonna
return that object out.

12
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.667
That's pretty like [SOUND].

13
00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:42.390
It's gonna do that whatever happens.

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.160
If we use a new keyword on paid user
creator, that's what it's gonna do.

15
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.560
So we're gonna have to be really
smart as to how we use that, and

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.180
still get to reuse the user creation code.

17
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.470
And have them work together.

18
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.165
Cuz there's gonna be a little bit comment.

19
00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:01.752
And that's why we take control
again with the help of cool.

20
00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:07.900
That allows us to take control of our
this assignment inside a user creator.

21
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.280
Cuz we're gonna use that
user creator code again.

22
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.650
I do not want to have to,

23
00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.850
write code to re-assign name and
score inside a paid user creator and

24
00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.810
usually it wouldn't be two properties
from user, I'm grabbing fifty properties.

25
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.620
I don't want to re-sit
them all on there again.

26
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.279
I want to user creator function
to add those properties, but

27
00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:29.940
it's gonna be a bit messy.

28
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.523
Because that user creator function
required a new key word that created

29
00:01:33.523 --> 00:01:34.298
an object, but

30
00:01:34.298 --> 00:01:38.590
we're using the new key word over here
that's creating a different object.

31
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.280
So how do these two gonna work together?

32
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.110
Well, what we're going to do,

33
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.300
is we're not even going to use
user creator with the new keyword.

34
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.380
It's really, really it's,
it's really interesting.

35
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.550
We're not even use user
creator with a new keyword,

36
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.360
we're gonna use user
creator independent of it.

37
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.090
Well, then what the hell
does this refer to?

38
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.516
Don't panic,
we're gonna use it with the call.

39
00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:04.320
That's gonna set this
inside the user creator,

40
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.440
to be the this that was the auto
created object in paid user creator.

41
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.160
They're not gonna be different objects,
we're gonna use this one in user creator,

42
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.880
and have it indirectly be mutated
from within user creator.

43
00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.330
It is one of the most intricate, finicky
little pieces of all of JavaScript.

44
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.990
But we're gonna play it out.

45
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.745
So, let's go to the right-hand
side of our code,

46
00:02:27.745 --> 00:02:32.840
still the same application,
still the same run time.

47
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.310
It's sort of continuing over, and Michael
top right-hand side, what are we doing?

48
00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.250
&gt;&gt; Michael: Creating a function
called paid user creator.

49
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.670
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Paid user Creator,
which is a function.

50
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.020
Who wants to give me the full
story of what this function is?

51
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.170
Cuz we know we're gonna be calling
the creator with a new keyword.

52
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.210
So we know that when it's called,

53
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.380
it's gonna make reference to some of
the function in its object format.

54
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.800
So someone give me the, sort of
the full piece we're doing in, Terry,

55
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.020
you wanna tell me when I declare page
user creator, what else is happening?

56
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.770
It's a function plus?

57
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.520
&gt;&gt; Terry: An object.

58
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.460
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Plus an object,
beautiful man, there it is.

59
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.590
There's the object portion.

60
00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.145
Which on the object portion has
automatically what property,Terry?

61
00:03:20.145 --> 00:03:20.714
&gt;&gt; Terry: This?

62
00:03:20.714 --> 00:03:23.460
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Terry: A prototype.

63
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.220
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Prototype,
well done man, prototype,

64
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.674
which is a big old empty object.

65
00:03:31.674 --> 00:03:37.610
Where, any objects

66
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.150
that get returned from running paid
user creator with a new keyword.

67
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.600
Will also automatically have their
proto-bond be set to link to that object.

68
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.270
So let's put our functions in there,
that we won't Paid User 1, Paid User 2,

69
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.070
Paid User 50,
to all have access to that object.

70
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.860
We hope we're gonna do that.

71
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.950
So let's see if we do.

72
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.290
Paid user creator .prototype,
we want this object,

73
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:15.440
this object is gonna be linked to by
any object, pages of 1, pages of 2,

74
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.580
pages of 50, that come out of running,
paid user/creator with a new keyword.

75
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.440
They're gonna have their
protobond to this object.

76
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.800
So we want to put in that object and
I kinda want to do it first.

77
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.400
I'm not sure why I did.

78
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.990
That's why it's a little bit silly
the way I did this but it's okay.

79
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.040
We want that object to also have its
protobond be up to these functions.

80
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.580
Remember that from last time?

81
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.520
So that we have access to the specific
paid user functions like increase balance,

82
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.470
but also still to all
the regular use functions.

83
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.080
So how do we make that bond?

84
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.930
David I asked you this last time,

85
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.930
what do I need to add to this object to
have it have a link up to these functions?

86
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.780
What does this object need to have to
have a link up to these functions.

87
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.560
&gt;&gt; David: Proto.

88
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.410
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Proto spot on, a hidden
proto property which would link up.

89
00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.380
But how do I set its proto?

90
00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.160
Well actually,
I can just use set prototype all, can't I?

91
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.280
But for some reason,
I decided to do it this way.

92
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.990
Which was to completely
overwrite the object.

93
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.730
I'm going to change this cuz,
but it's fine.

94
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.940
Both illegitimate, but to completely
overwritethe object, prototype object and

95
00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.610
seek a brand new object in there, right?

96
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.260
I'll do that create return out
of brand new of the object,

97
00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.280
which has it's proto set to.

98
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.910
&gt;&gt; Michael: The user creator prototype.

99
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.830
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Exactly,
there it is, and that then links up

100
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.510
to, and that means this
object here is ready to go,

101
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.950
ready to go to link up here,
that's fantastic, all right.

102
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.460
Good, and now,

103
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.900
we wanna make sure that this object
has its Paid user specific function.

104
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.790
Seth, tell me what we'll
do on our next line here.

105
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.820
Paid user
created.prototype.increaseBalance.

106
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.420
Tell me what we do.

107
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.400
&gt;&gt; Michael: Adding a method called
increaseBalance to the prototype

108
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.350
object on paid user creator.

109
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.172
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Yeah, excellent man.

110
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.310
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: Okay,
now we've done all our setup here.

111
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.210
There it all is.

112
00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.880
We have a function that we call
the new keyword pages of creator.

113
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.610
Hopefully it returns out an object,
we saw in pages one.

114
00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:18.490
And that object,

115
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.186
because this function is gonna be called
the new keyword is hopefully gonna

116
00:06:22.186 --> 00:06:25.955
have a bond to the pages creator prototype
where we find increased balance.

117
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:30.880
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: And then that is gonna
still have a bond up to user created

118
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.200
dot prototype.

119
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.870
So that these functions are all
available to our pages of one.

120
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.060
But, so that our user1 still only has
access to our user only functions.
