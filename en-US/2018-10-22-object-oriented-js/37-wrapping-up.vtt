00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.820
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: I will say
there's a solution four,

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.970
it is now fairly clean
of an implementation.

3
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.602
But under the hood, my God.

4
00:00:09.602 --> 00:00:13.891
[LAUGH] I feel like I've been on one of
those crazed, you've been in a kind of

5
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:19.000
zone artistically and then you look back
and you're like, shit, what happened here?

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.050
[LAUGH] So solution four, it is cleaner.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.950
The code is pretty clean.

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.350
But folks, to debug it effectively,

9
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.720
we have to still know that all of
this is going on under the hood.

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.540
Cuz imagine you came to
JavaScript from Java and

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.510
you thought this was emulating Java or
Python under the hood.

12
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.176
I mean you would just be
left with a complete blank.

13
00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.610
And a complete inability to go and

14
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.780
actually debug and
write clean code long term.

15
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.760
We now have, I hope, the tools under
the hood to know exactly what a class is.

16
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.790
To know exactly what extends is doing,
and where it comes in with super.

17
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.390
And where it comes in with our proto
reference to our prototype object,

18
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.170
with its proto referencer
this prototype object.

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.700
We know every last piece.

20
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.900
So what I'm this was even more demanding
than hard parts, the new hard parts.

21
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.930
That is pretty demanding.

22
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.630
But I'm very, very impressed that you all
followed along, so, thank you, so much.

23
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.750
Thank you to our wonderful online
audience, it's been a pleasure having you.

24
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.227
If you did stick it out, and
I know some of you are around the world,

25
00:01:33.227 --> 00:01:37.472
and it's now the new, early morning in
Indonesia, where I know some of you are.

26
00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.080
It has been a delight to have you on,
as well.

27
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.519
And so, thank you, so much,
everybody, and now, we wrap.

28
00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:44.779
Thank you everybody.

29
00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:49.392
