1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.148
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: All right, so

2
00:00:01.148 --> 00:00:06.039
the GitHub profile README is
a special profile repository.

3
00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:11.419
So you go to your repos,
just like how the github.io

4
00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.567
is a specialized repository,
you go right here.

5
00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.911
It is a GitHub profile README page.

6
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.651
Then you could go to, and

7
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:27.749
it essentially creates
a README of your work.

8
00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.107
It's a detail README,
think of it as a part of

9
00:00:32.107 --> 00:00:36.486
telling your story on your profile, right?

10
00:00:36.486 --> 00:00:40.221
&gt;&gt; Student 1: So they create a repo
with their user name on GitHub and

11
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:42.969
then a README.md inside of that repo?

12
00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.677
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yes, so
you will create like, sorry,

13
00:00:45.677 --> 00:00:47.903
I will go through that process.

14
00:00:47.903 --> 00:00:51.983
So, you create a repo with your user name,
so Joola for

15
00:00:51.983 --> 00:00:56.001
me is Jerome Hardaway,
backslash Jerome Hardaway.

16
00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:01.926
That creates a specialized
repository which is just a README,

17
00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:06.637
and it will appear publicly
on my GitHub profile.

18
00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:10.525
&gt;&gt; Student 2: That's automatic as long
as you create a repo that is a copy of

19
00:01:10.525 --> 00:01:11.602
your username?

20
00:01:11.602 --> 00:01:15.134
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yes,
it's automatic, it does that for you.

21
00:01:17.796 --> 00:01:20.345
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: You don't have
to figure out or do anything.

22
00:01:20.345 --> 00:01:23.956
It's not like GitHub pages,
where you have to go in and

23
00:01:23.956 --> 00:01:28.048
say on a repo, I want this to be
a part of GitHub pages, right?

24
00:01:28.048 --> 00:01:30.215
Cuz I know that's what
you're kind of thinking,

25
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.703
like, do I have to go into settings and
choose that?

26
00:01:32.703 --> 00:01:34.026
No, you don't have to do that.

27
00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.339
If you do it this way,
it automatically happens.

28
00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:41.192
I don't add another picture
to my profile reading,

29
00:01:41.192 --> 00:01:45.745
there's no point in having a,
like, the way this UX is done,

30
00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:50.928
when you add a banner to your special
profile, it doesn't look well.

31
00:01:50.928 --> 00:01:54.830
Because you have a banner on your
profile next to your headshot or

32
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.287
your your profile pic.

33
00:01:56.287 --> 00:02:00.035
So it's like,
here's this big rectangular banner, and

34
00:02:00.035 --> 00:02:04.251
here's your profile pic, like,
nowhere does that make sense.

35
00:02:04.251 --> 00:02:08.787
Even on LinkedIn, they have
the banner above your profile pic,

36
00:02:08.787 --> 00:02:10.723
above and behind, right?

37
00:02:10.723 --> 00:02:16.315
So I tell people,
try to minimize having any images or

38
00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:19.928
pictures on your profile README.

39
00:02:19.928 --> 00:02:25.203
Now, what I've done a lot of,
I used to have a lot of external

40
00:02:25.203 --> 00:02:29.871
things from Vercel that
would read my repositories.

41
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:36.465
I took a lot of those off because 1,
security issues, 2, I don't want it busy.

42
00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:44.408
Remember, the HR people, they are getting
600 applications each job now, right?

43
00:02:44.408 --> 00:02:49.552
I don't know, you've seen it on
LinkedIn when I show you how,

44
00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:52.171
this job just hit 2 minutes ago and

45
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:56.350
hey, 435 people have already
applied to this job.

46
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.288
You're like, how did that happen?

47
00:02:58.288 --> 00:03:02.224
You've been up for ten minutes,
like, did everybody,

48
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:05.671
I was like,
do people just have it ready to go now?

49
00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:07.920
That's crazy, right?

50
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.431
&gt;&gt; Student 3: Just to confirm what you're
saying, there was an intern application

51
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:16.799
offer from Hennepin County for
our department, and we got 320.

52
00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.020
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: 320?
&gt;&gt; Student 3: We just needed two

53
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.807
people, yeah.

54
00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:20.001
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yeah, 320-.

55
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:21.847
&gt;&gt; Student 3: 320 applications.

56
00:03:21.847 --> 00:03:23.983
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yeah, and
you select the two people out here?

57
00:03:23.983 --> 00:03:25.855
&gt;&gt; Student 3: Yeah,
we just wanted two, sir.

58
00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:29.501
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So yeah, that is
actually what happened in the market,

59
00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.053
right?

60
00:03:30.053 --> 00:03:34.959
So in this type of market, I wanna get
my information, the relevant information

61
00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.519
on what I'm doing fast as possible to
the people that that matter, right?

62
00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.007
So, I omit the banners, omit all the fancy
stuff, I kept it nice and clean.

63
00:03:45.007 --> 00:03:49.358
And above the fold content, as you see,
the minute I hit Jerome Hardaway,

64
00:03:49.358 --> 00:03:53.501
that URL, they already know my
technical skills, they know about me,

65
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.454
they know about my work, right?

66
00:03:55.454 --> 00:03:56.776
They see key projects, right?

67
00:03:56.776 --> 00:04:02.066
They don't have to scale down to see
all the important stuff about me,

68
00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:06.474
to see key projects,
technical skills about me already.

69
00:04:06.474 --> 00:04:10.265
So I already have the keywords
cuz they're skimming, right?

70
00:04:10.265 --> 00:04:15.038
I'm thinking like, an HR person
has to go through 600 of these,

71
00:04:15.038 --> 00:04:18.911
now the ATS has maybe cut
it down from 600 to 120.

72
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:24.860
So now I have 120 of resumes and
LinkedIns and GitHubs to go through.

73
00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.654
So now I have 120, I'm gonna go through
here, keywords, keywords, keywords,

74
00:04:29.654 --> 00:04:30.612
go through here.

75
00:04:30.612 --> 00:04:35.658
And I am going to, here's key projects,
put the key projects up

76
00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:41.240
here because I wanna make it easy,
I wanna control the flow of information.

77
00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.176
That's one thing that we have to, for our
key projects and pending projects, right?

78
00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:47.639
We have to focus on our GitHub.

79
00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.664
We wanna control the flow of
the direction where people go.

80
00:04:51.664 --> 00:04:54.011
All right, so starting right here,

81
00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:58.113
I want to give you all a few minutes
to build your profile README.

82
00:04:58.113 --> 00:05:00.951
Start with your statement,
talk about your background and

83
00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:03.509
the things you're passionate
about in technology.

84
00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:05.268
Share your technical skills.

85
00:05:05.268 --> 00:05:07.732
Make sure you add your key projects.

86
00:05:07.732 --> 00:05:13.540
I recommend adding your key projects that
are, a, fleshed out with their READMEs.

87
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.166
B, popular in production.

88
00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:23.882
And c, they're clear to
show your skill set, right?

89
00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:25.454
They're relatable to your skills.

90
00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:30.415
For instance,
if I had READMEs that were popular and

91
00:05:30.415 --> 00:05:34.927
showcase the things that
were good showcase but

92
00:05:34.927 --> 00:05:39.322
it was written in .net, I wouldn't do it,,

93
00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:43.633
cuz I don't wanna get a job in .net,
right?

94
00:05:43.633 --> 00:05:47.940
Or if I had a repeat, that was repo,
that was a review that was in view,

95
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.600
I have no intention of working in view,
I prefer Next.js.

96
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.536
So I'm gonna only show Next.js work,
right?

97
00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:58.568
Those are the key projects
that I would showcase.

98
00:05:58.568 --> 00:06:02.934
And then continue, now this is where,
as you see, just like my resume,

99
00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:06.889
now I've gotten all the important
stuff above the fold, right?

100
00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:10.330
Important stuff always
goes above the fold.

101
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.863
After that,
I start talking about leadership,

102
00:06:14.863 --> 00:06:18.406
my goals, and how to connect with me.

103
00:06:18.406 --> 00:06:20.710
Anyone connecting with me,
I think of that as my CTA.

104
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.587
I'm trying to get people that connect,
that see this,

105
00:06:24.587 --> 00:06:26.827
to get into my network, right?

106
00:06:26.827 --> 00:06:28.000
I wanna get them to my LinkedIn,

107
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.532
I wanna get them to my Twitter,
I wanna get them to start emailing me.

108
00:06:30.532 --> 00:06:34.326
I want get these people into
my personal funnel, like,

109
00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:39.668
that I'm sending my resume and stuff out
cuz that's what you have to think of.

110
00:06:39.668 --> 00:06:42.637
Now, you're sending
an informational funnel,

111
00:06:42.637 --> 00:06:46.677
everything is a feeder into your
funnel for you to get a job, right?

112
00:06:46.677 --> 00:06:50.376
I send my resume out,
have my LinkedIn, have my GitHub,

113
00:06:50.376 --> 00:06:52.853
it's all a part of my funnel, right?

114
00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:58.360
I use the same resume, the same email
to push everything into my funnel,

115
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.167
so that way I can get
the roles that I want, right?

116
00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:05.517
So you all take about five minutes,
start working on that,

117
00:07:05.517 --> 00:07:09.950
at least get your GitHub profile live,
and then we will go into your pin repos.
