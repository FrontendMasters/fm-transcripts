00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.416
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So that Mid &amp; Seniors.

2
00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:04.826
Now, this is where you fit in, right?

3
00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:09.573
It's different, what I see,
the number one problem,

4
00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:15.734
especially as you get higher in your
career, you stop communicating and

5
00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.680
networking less because
you get complacent.

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.244
In the military, we have a term,
complacency kills.

7
00:00:25.244 --> 00:00:30.917
It kills in real life and
in military terms, kills careers, right?

8
00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:34.854
You're sitting, you're being
complacent with your career, and

9
00:00:34.854 --> 00:00:39.285
then you get laid off and you're like,
holy crap, what am I supposed to do?

10
00:00:39.285 --> 00:00:43.846
Because you have not been out there
drilling the skills that pay the bills.

11
00:00:43.846 --> 00:00:45.579
You haven't been making new connections.

12
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.359
You haven't been making
internal connections.

13
00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:52.187
You come in, you do your eight hours,
you learn just-in-time skills for

14
00:00:52.187 --> 00:00:56.378
whatever project you're building, and
you go home, you plot in front of the TV,

15
00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:57.259
you do nothing.

16
00:00:57.259 --> 00:01:01.418
So when it comes out, it hurts you, right?

17
00:01:01.418 --> 00:01:04.344
First thing you should do,
whether you're looking for a job now or

18
00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:07.062
you're not looking for a job,
is you should start looking and

19
00:01:07.062 --> 00:01:08.908
leveraging your existing connections.

20
00:01:10.008 --> 00:01:14.690
To this day, once a week,
I talk to at least two different

21
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.607
people that I haven't
talked to within a year.

22
00:01:18.607 --> 00:01:22.851
I make it my point to go through
my LinkedIn on Sunday and

23
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:28.317
reach out on Monday to two people I
have not spoken to in at least a year.

24
00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:31.069
I've been doing that for five years now.

25
00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:32.062
You can do that.

26
00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:36.174
That's a very small ask for
yourself to keep your network fresh.

27
00:01:36.174 --> 00:01:38.841
Go talk to somebody,
send a LinkedIn message for

28
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.818
someone you haven't spoken to at
least a year, that's professional.

29
00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:44.926
And just say, hey,
I was thinking about you.

30
00:01:44.926 --> 00:01:50.544
I wanted to catch up sometime and see what
you're working on and share war stories.

31
00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:52.762
It's very easy, very small ask.

32
00:01:52.762 --> 00:01:55.907
When you're talking,
you're keeping your network fresh, right?

33
00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.871
That's the first step that
you need to be doing.

34
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.645
Reach out to the programmers,
UX designers,

35
00:02:01.645 --> 00:02:04.214
the talent that you already know, right?

36
00:02:04.214 --> 00:02:06.801
And when I ask, hey,
what are you doing for work?

37
00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:08.336
How it is at your place?

38
00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:12.378
My place, I'm getting kinda shaky,
I might be on looking for something new.

39
00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:14.966
Hey, yo, man, we got these new roles.

40
00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:17.097
You get your resume and everything going.

41
00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:19.193
I can refer you.

42
00:02:19.193 --> 00:02:23.237
Snap, now I have a referral
that I wasn't even looking for

43
00:02:23.237 --> 00:02:26.058
cuz I just talked to my network, right?

44
00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:29.718
I just talked to people I already knew.

45
00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:33.325
You can transition to that
product-based networking format.

46
00:02:33.325 --> 00:02:37.549
For me, it builds a format
of a way of trust, right?

47
00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.337
I like products-focused feedback
loop as my networking because it

48
00:02:42.337 --> 00:02:46.285
doesn't feel as intrusive and
just sliding into DMs and

49
00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:49.989
asking people for
their time just because, right?

50
00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.174
I think that's helped me.

51
00:02:53.174 --> 00:02:54.463
I have a product.

52
00:02:54.463 --> 00:02:55.862
I wanna improve it.

53
00:02:55.862 --> 00:02:58.174
Can I ask for your feedback for it?

54
00:02:58.174 --> 00:02:59.257
Thank you for your feedback.

55
00:02:59.257 --> 00:03:01.527
I'm gonna take that feedback and
iterate on it.

56
00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:03.568
Now that I have that feedback,
and I'm gonna iterate on it,

57
00:03:03.568 --> 00:03:04.817
I'm gonna talk to you again.

58
00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:08.453
Next thing you know, three, four,
or five conversations on the end.

59
00:03:08.453 --> 00:03:10.789
We're talking about,
can we get on a call sometime?

60
00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:12.017
Now we get on the call.

61
00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:16.057
Hey, I'd love to buy you coffee around
on this call so we can go dive deeper.

62
00:03:16.057 --> 00:03:19.277
I'm networking with this person,
especially we're over Zoom.

63
00:03:19.277 --> 00:03:21.996
I've sent the Starbucks gift card or
a DoorDash card.

64
00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:26.381
They have DoorDash Starbucks to their
house cuz Starbucks is on DoorDash, or

65
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:29.089
I think you'll have
Carboru coffee down here.

66
00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.609
Caribou.

67
00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.990
Caribou, yeah, something like that.

68
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.963
You all can DoorDash that,
Uber Eats it, their coffee of choice.

69
00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:40.844
We go from there, now we're on the Zoom,
we're talking, I'm showing them projects,

70
00:03:40.844 --> 00:03:42.890
showing them code-based
stuff that I can do.

71
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.286
And they're like, okay,
now I'm building that rapport,

72
00:03:46.286 --> 00:03:49.230
I'm building that network,
I'm pouring into it.

73
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.018
But you have to realize,
the best time to start that is yesterday,

74
00:03:54.018 --> 00:03:56.540
the second best time is today.

75
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.114
Networking is not a short-person game, and

76
00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:03.058
I think that's one of the things why
people are so bad at it right now.

77
00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:04.750
They want that instant feedback loop.

78
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.156
They don't understand that it takes
years to get to the point where

79
00:04:10.156 --> 00:04:16.059
you get a network of substance, right,
you get a network of influence.

80
00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:19.870
When we think of influence now,
we think of followers and likes, and

81
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.169
then we convert those followers and
likes into marketing.

82
00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.517
That's not what influence is.

83
00:04:25.517 --> 00:04:28.066
Influence is, hey, I can call this person.

84
00:04:28.066 --> 00:04:32.945
This person can help me get
my foot in the door into

85
00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:38.189
this role while everybody else is hurting,
right?

86
00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:40.650
There's a group that I talk to.

87
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.575
And one of the things that those people
have, they have that influence and

88
00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:46.284
networks that they talk about,

89
00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:49.793
is the survivor's guilt that
they're having in the community.

90
00:04:49.793 --> 00:04:53.465
Because they know intrinsically,
regardless of what happen,

91
00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:57.616
they're gonna be kinda okay cuz they
know that their network is secure.

92
00:04:57.616 --> 00:04:59.517
They know that they have options.

93
00:04:59.517 --> 00:05:01.936
And so whenever they feel bad for
the people that don't.

94
00:05:01.936 --> 00:05:06.595
And they're like, what do I tell
the people that don't wanna do

95
00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:11.008
these things that I've done,
or how do I help them, right?

96
00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:13.060
I mean, that's one of the things
that we're always talking about.

97
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.330
How do I help people who might
not want to do this type of work?

98
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.099
And the only thing we can do is by
showcasing the lack of stress that it

99
00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:22.705
comes to.

100
00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:24.579
Yes, it sounds a lot like work.

101
00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:29.451
I'm gonna spend Sunday looking
through my LinkedIn like a weirdo

102
00:05:29.451 --> 00:05:33.536
to email two people that I
haven't spoken to in a year.

103
00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:38.809
You don't know what opportunities those
people are giving or what conversations

104
00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:42.700
you're missing, or, heaven forbid,
if those people are still around.

105
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.791
You might have actually
liked those people and

106
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:47.320
you don't even know if
they're still around anymore.

107
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.072
So you need to go to your network,
talk to people.

108
00:05:51.072 --> 00:05:53.472
With Mid &amp; Senior, your first step,

109
00:05:53.472 --> 00:05:57.007
emphasizing the people that
you already know, right?

110
00:05:57.007 --> 00:06:01.263
Start rebuilding those relationships,
your rapport.

111
00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:04.896
Focus on your established skill set,
right?

112
00:06:04.896 --> 00:06:07.149
There are people who you know think and

113
00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:10.474
feel like you're pretty good at your job,
right?

114
00:06:10.474 --> 00:06:11.729
Start with that, all right?

115
00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.112
Start with those people, and
then move forward from there, right?

116
00:06:16.112 --> 00:06:21.301
You wanna make it expansive, but
you want your end marketing and

117
00:06:21.301 --> 00:06:24.484
sales, they call it your core 100.

118
00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:29.213
You want your core 100, the people
that are gonna support you no matter

119
00:06:29.213 --> 00:06:34.179
what you do, and you wanna build in
your network, your core 100, right?

120
00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:37.473
That is your primary
focus when networking.

121
00:06:37.473 --> 00:06:41.982
You're gonna have 5,000, 6,000 people,
but what you really need is

122
00:06:41.982 --> 00:06:46.241
a core 100 in your network that are gonna
help your career no matter what.
