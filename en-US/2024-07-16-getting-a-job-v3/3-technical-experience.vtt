00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.291
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Here's a template
based upon resumes we have seen at work

2
00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:05.749
this year, right?

3
00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:12.697
So it's very plain,
formatting super simple, very legible.

4
00:00:12.697 --> 00:00:15.670
This is what you wanna keep it.

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.874
You wanna make it as easy for
a robot to read as possible.

6
00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:23.816
Remember, it is a highlight reel, but

7
00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:27.926
it's also gonna be read by
a machine at first, right?

8
00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:32.851
So a lot of the formatting quirkiness that
we would do in the past and bolding and

9
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:36.820
things like that,
it's already gonna look for the keywords.

10
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.246
So you don't need a bold or
do any of the keywords like that.

11
00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:41.251
That doesn't make any sense.

12
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:45.311
And some of that formatting
throws the machine off, right?

13
00:00:45.311 --> 00:00:49.999
So what we've been doing is
we've been using plain text and

14
00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:55.358
just putting that directly into
the machine and seeing what works.

15
00:00:55.358 --> 00:00:59.057
And so far, this is what we've had our
highest success rates with, right?

16
00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:02.472
Guess you have your information.

17
00:01:02.472 --> 00:01:06.295
For this one, we use just the LinkedIn
because LinkedIn is kinda robust and

18
00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:08.914
that's why everybody goes
through first anyway.

19
00:01:08.914 --> 00:01:11.743
Professional summary with make sure that I

20
00:01:11.743 --> 00:01:16.630
include that I'm using full stack
development and cloud technologies.

21
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.964
I wanna make sure that I am saying
what type, I'm using product, but

22
00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:22.474
I'm also using cloud.

23
00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:27.054
Have a track record, assisted performance,
leading successful projects and

24
00:01:27.054 --> 00:01:30.966
continuous learning skills,
depth to collaborating with teams.

25
00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:34.602
Cuz that knowing how to collaborate is, or

26
00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:38.442
having saying that is
now a big resume smell.

27
00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:42.714
They wanna know that you know how to work
with people, or they want to know that

28
00:01:42.714 --> 00:01:46.552
you're thinking about how to work
with people and going from there.

29
00:01:46.552 --> 00:01:51.773
Now, in my work experience, as you see,
I'm saying where I worked at,

30
00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:57.165
it was a remote, was in the city,
etc, and how long I worked there.

31
00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:59.040
But I'm saying I'm using data, right?

32
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.622
I'm using percentages.

33
00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:03.831
I'm saying we optimize
this cloud infrastructure,

34
00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:07.405
increase performance by 35%,
reduce costs by 20%.

35
00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:09.829
There's a lot more metrics
that are being asked.

36
00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:14.195
They wanna see the value
that you bring in your role,

37
00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:17.084
a lot more on your resume, right?

38
00:02:17.084 --> 00:02:21.768
We are seeing metric based resumes
getting a lot more positive feedback.

39
00:02:21.768 --> 00:02:28.001
A lot more callbacks than those resumes
that do not have metrics on them.

40
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:32.159
We also seeing that the cut off is
usually three pages once you go

41
00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.632
past three pages on your resume,
they're kinda this is overkill,

42
00:02:36.632 --> 00:02:40.967
you get, it gets thrown out by
the computer and everything else.

43
00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:43.047
So one page or three pages,

44
00:02:43.047 --> 00:02:47.886
is what you really want to get
one to three pages, right?

45
00:02:47.886 --> 00:02:52.611
As you see as keep going further on,
I keep that,

46
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.816
I say what I did, I say the value of it.

47
00:02:56.816 --> 00:03:01.253
And then I also say the technology coz
I know that those keywords are gonna be

48
00:03:01.253 --> 00:03:01.968
picked up.

49
00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:06.588
So if I know AWS as popular as
yours popular, I've worked at AWS,

50
00:03:06.588 --> 00:03:10.419
I worked for Azure,
I'm gonna put that in there.

51
00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.289
I want to know Jas.

52
00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:12.739
I'm gonna put that in our React.

53
00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.559
Now here's a gotcha that
we have been seeing.

54
00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:19.761
Saying you work with React,
you need to say the back

55
00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:24.373
in technology that you work
with with React these days.

56
00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:29.554
Because a lot of people,
particularly with after the update of

57
00:03:29.554 --> 00:03:35.339
the Facebook documentation,
they are now, are you using Next.js?

58
00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:37.278
Right, that's what they wanna know.

59
00:03:37.278 --> 00:03:38.312
Are you using Next?

60
00:03:38.312 --> 00:03:41.286
And if you're using Next,
are you using Vercel?

61
00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:42.780
Coz that's what they recommend.

62
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.197
Now if you're gonna go production ready,

63
00:03:45.197 --> 00:03:48.157
you just don't even use React,
just use Next.js.

64
00:03:48.157 --> 00:03:49.706
It works, right?

65
00:03:49.706 --> 00:03:52.107
So that's what it says on the docs.

66
00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:56.267
So that now when you're saying you're
using React, you need to make sure you

67
00:03:56.267 --> 00:03:59.916
have what backend technologies
you're using React with, right?

68
00:03:59.916 --> 00:04:01.592
So you're using React with.net.

69
00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:03.710
Got to make sure you say
that just can't say React.

70
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.221
You're using React with Django or
flask like I always

71
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:14.376
recommend to the dangers
of flask versus Django.

72
00:04:14.376 --> 00:04:19.151
For instance, one is a lot bigger than
the other one flask is tend to be,

73
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.630
I believe as flat as the smaller one.

74
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.323
And joining us,
the bigger more robust framework and

75
00:04:26.323 --> 00:04:30.599
when people see that they
see Django it's closer

76
00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.261
aligned with like Java spring and .net.

77
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:39.034
So that is what I always recommend
people are gonna be doing Python.

78
00:04:39.034 --> 00:04:41.230
Make sure you're building things of that.

79
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.253
And then, but whenever you're using
with React, if you're just using React,

80
00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:49.600
you need to make sure that you're staying
with the back end that you're using.

81
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.070
But if you're using Next.js,
say that, right?

82
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.690
Say, and
talk about your collaboration, right?

83
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.098
Your cross team collaboration.

84
00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:02.513
Knowing that you have that experience and
you're implementing user-centric features.

85
00:05:02.513 --> 00:05:05.293
You're boosting user engagement
whatever you're doing,

86
00:05:05.293 --> 00:05:09.546
how you're implementing productivity, how
you're helping with the planning meetings,

87
00:05:09.546 --> 00:05:12.504
etc, make sure you're putting
those examples on your resume.
