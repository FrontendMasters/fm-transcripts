00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.724
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So we're gonna move on
to the crafting of your profile README and

2
00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:08.064
your profile in general.

3
00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:13.308
So, we're gonna select
a professional profile picture.

4
00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:17.653
Who all has a name on their GitHub
that doesn't make any sense?

5
00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:24.874
And then, is your name, are you at
Jerome Hardaway like I am, is it plain?

6
00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:28.599
Or are you like at Apex Fire or

7
00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:34.048
at Superhero 72 or some crap like that?

8
00:00:34.048 --> 00:00:38.722
Please, we're gonna start there.

9
00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:45.077
If you have time today, make a repo, make
a GitHub that has like your plane name or

10
00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:49.860
change your name so
that people can actually recognize you.

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.419
If you're gonna be using this for getting
jobs, you gotta be, you wouldn't use

12
00:00:55.419 --> 00:01:01.336
email like giants fan 72 or something like
that for on your resume, don't do that.

13
00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:04.836
If you are gonna do that, don't do that,

14
00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:09.245
treat the email rule and
the GitHub rule is the same.

15
00:01:09.245 --> 00:01:13.742
Post compelling bio,
If you saw my last chorus,

16
00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:19.007
we were very much about how to
do the process of making sure

17
00:01:19.007 --> 00:01:25.498
that you had a elevator pitch or
a brand document of yourself, right?

18
00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:27.425
So we're gonna go a little bit into that,
but

19
00:01:27.425 --> 00:01:30.491
we're not gonna touch that as much
because that was on the last course.

20
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:34.416
You should definitely know by now,
if you're a fan of me,

21
00:01:34.416 --> 00:01:38.105
you know that I'm very much
about brand document, and

22
00:01:38.105 --> 00:01:42.451
knowing how to sell and
market yourself having your Bragg docs.

23
00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:45.633
And having a database of
everything you need to

24
00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.086
be able to quickly go where you are.

25
00:01:48.086 --> 00:01:51.752
I still have the brand notion,
the brand doc database,

26
00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:56.588
example that if you need it, I'll
definitely throw it out there for you,

27
00:01:56.588 --> 00:02:01.588
but you should definitely always,
this is your career, you have to start.

28
00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:05.492
One of the things that I talk about in
my courses and my work is you have to,

29
00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.541
especially in this current climate.

30
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:11.202
You have to start being
counter-offensive and

31
00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:16.702
even on the offense when you're in
this in this type of market, right?

32
00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:20.356
You can't be the era of just being,
just chill and

33
00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:25.142
whatever happens in your career
is not happening in your career.

34
00:02:25.142 --> 00:02:29.067
It's over, it's dead, you gotta plan it,
you gotta be offensive,

35
00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:30.939
you gotta be counteroffensive.

36
00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.563
You gotta be thinking one or three moves
ahead, you gotta be thinking not like

37
00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:38.327
an employee, but like an employee partner
with the company that you're with.

38
00:02:38.327 --> 00:02:42.592
You're an employee and you're a partner,
and you know that your relationship with

39
00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:46.568
this partner, why you might love these
people is essentially value-based.

40
00:02:46.568 --> 00:02:50.249
And you have to keep that at at top
of mind all the time that this is

41
00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.615
a value-based relationship, right?

42
00:02:52.615 --> 00:02:56.092
And you have to treat it as such, and you
have to continue to build your own value,

43
00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.153
invest in your own value,
invest in yourself.

44
00:02:58.153 --> 00:03:01.630
Use company resources,
they are offer that to invest in yourself,

45
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.132
but you have to keep that process going,
right?

46
00:03:04.132 --> 00:03:07.891
So that is what I hopefully, we're on V3.

47
00:03:07.891 --> 00:03:11.434
If you have seen V1, V2, I am very big and

48
00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:16.769
you have to be counter offensive
with this type of work, right?

49
00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.092
Here are my rules for your bio pick people
are like, do I have to have a picture?

50
00:03:22.092 --> 00:03:25.518
Yes, you need a picture of you,
please, no weird stuff.

51
00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:26.752
I know everybody loves,

52
00:03:26.752 --> 00:03:30.823
everybody wants to have fun on GitHub and
you could do that 10 years ago, right?

53
00:03:30.823 --> 00:03:35.579
You could have a picture of Sonic
as your GitHub profile, [LAUGH],

54
00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.009
and people would still hire you.

55
00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:42.913
You can't do that anymore,
tech has grown up, I'm sorry.

56
00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:46.897
The days of, Mark Zuckerberg
running around calling himself,

57
00:03:46.897 --> 00:03:48.898
I'm CEO on his business cards.

58
00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:49.847
You see him,

59
00:03:49.847 --> 00:03:55.816
he's dripped out with a chain trying to
get Gen Z to come back to Facebook, right?

60
00:03:55.816 --> 00:04:01.185
It's a different world, we have to be,
we have to adapt with it.

61
00:04:01.185 --> 00:04:04.817
If Zuc can get drip,
you can put your professional bio,

62
00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:08.532
like your professional photo,
on your GitHub, right?

63
00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:10.001
That's how we're gonna look at it.

64
00:04:10.001 --> 00:04:14.723
Zuckerberg, level up his dressing game,
we have to level up our profile game.

65
00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:17.454
So, with your professional pitcher,

66
00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:22.336
do choose a our professional photo
suits tech industry, nice shirt,

67
00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:26.905
solid color, maybe if you have
a brand like me, I break the rule.

68
00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:29.695
I still know regular shirt and stuff, but

69
00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:32.892
I have the whole
Captain America of code thing.

70
00:04:32.892 --> 00:04:36.380
So people recognize me for that.

71
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.230
So I can break the mode, I can have,
me with a shield and a profile ticket etc,

72
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.196
which is still at almost 40,
is wild, I migh retire to shield.

73
00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:48.696
I'm lying, don't worry about it.

74
00:04:48.696 --> 00:04:51.965
But yeah, nice image.

75
00:04:51.965 --> 00:04:55.744
You can have it, like, in COVID, we were
experimenting with a lot of having it

76
00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:58.517
drawn avatars,
having professionals like David Neil.

77
00:04:58.517 --> 00:05:01.453
He's a great person for it, right?

78
00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:06.133
He would make people's avatars and
he would draw them and it was professional

79
00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:10.461
grade and people would use that Esther
profile pic and people loved it.

80
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:15.222
And I have on my GitHub page,
I use a from Covatar

81
00:05:15.222 --> 00:05:19.517
where they make donations to nonprofits.

82
00:05:19.517 --> 00:05:24.998
If you, and they'll draw your avatar.

83
00:05:24.998 --> 00:05:28.775
I use one of them as my profile pic for
like a year and it worked.

84
00:05:28.775 --> 00:05:32.749
Still amazing bio, but
that's what I want you to do, so

85
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.295
pick a decent image by our own tips.

86
00:05:35.295 --> 00:05:39.420
We're gonna learn how to craft by
others not only informative but

87
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.096
engaging we go off that basis,
upon our resume, as well.

88
00:05:43.096 --> 00:05:48.641
It's really good to do that for,
have a uniform, a format of everything you

89
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:53.683
want the same information,
the same keywords everywhere, right?

90
00:05:53.683 --> 00:05:56.722
And contact information safety, right?

91
00:05:56.722 --> 00:06:00.931
A lot of people, they put a lot of their
information out here and you're wondering

92
00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:05.206
why you get all these weird spam emails,
like, okay, well, this is why, right?

93
00:06:05.206 --> 00:06:08.460
So, that's what we're gonna focus on.

94
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.713
Here is my profile, I used to
have a lot of fancy things on it,

95
00:06:13.713 --> 00:06:18.874
but I have cleaned it up to for
this current market, right?

96
00:06:18.874 --> 00:06:21.803
So, as you see, I have,
nice black and white,

97
00:06:21.803 --> 00:06:26.641
I am smiling cuz all the other pictures
I'm scowling and I know I scout so much so

98
00:06:26.641 --> 00:06:29.451
I'll take your picture
of me [LAUGH] smiling.

99
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:36.817
So I do that, I have my name, as I said,
Jerome Hardaway, nice and plain.

100
00:06:36.817 --> 00:06:39.393
It also goes well with my URL, right?

101
00:06:39.393 --> 00:06:45.139
I have a nice clean URL image,
URL and image goes with me.

102
00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.004
I have how would I like to do I
like to focus on for me code.

103
00:06:50.004 --> 00:06:55.634
I focus on initiatives to help veterans
while learning how I can encode, right?

104
00:06:55.634 --> 00:06:58.641
And I just go through
everything in your profile.

105
00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:03.437
Now, I have my old location,
time it is that location,

106
00:07:03.437 --> 00:07:07.936
my email right here,
some people mask their email.

107
00:07:07.936 --> 00:07:12.174
This is the only email I share
on here just for resumes and

108
00:07:12.174 --> 00:07:15.432
stuff cuz that's only when it goes there.

109
00:07:15.432 --> 00:07:18.996
My website and my LinkedIn,
you go to edit profile,

110
00:07:18.996 --> 00:07:21.516
you can edit all of these right here.

111
00:07:21.516 --> 00:07:24.248
Directly you don't have
to go anywhere else.

112
00:07:24.248 --> 00:07:26.978
And you can also add more links
to a social profile right here.

113
00:07:26.978 --> 00:07:30.359
I only really use LinkedIn
because I focus on work.

114
00:07:30.359 --> 00:07:32.898
So, Linkedin is where work happens.

115
00:07:32.898 --> 00:07:36.978
So that for me,
my two big booze is LinkedIn, GitHub.

116
00:07:36.978 --> 00:07:38.702
I talked a little bit on Twitter, but

117
00:07:38.702 --> 00:07:42.043
I prefer LinkedIn and GitHub because
how I just find the crowds nicer and

118
00:07:42.043 --> 00:07:45.962
it's more focused on the things I enjoy
talking about, which is the craft at work.
