00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:01.637
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Talk about
the importance of a README.

2
00:00:01.637 --> 00:00:05.533
README is the first date of your code,
right?

3
00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.366
Before they jump into your code,
they're gonna look at your README, right?

4
00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:13.608
As you saw with the Vetsu Code app,
it says what it does.

5
00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:16.056
It says the technologies
that you're doing,

6
00:00:16.056 --> 00:00:18.701
it lets everyone know how to run it,
everything.

7
00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:23.630
Incorporating individual aids I
did not do that with a BWC app,

8
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.329
but you saw with the VS code thing.

9
00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.788
I had a visual aid right there
showing this is how it looks to you.

10
00:00:30.788 --> 00:00:36.193
Let's go for it, and I'm going to probably
go back and do this now that I've

11
00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:42.036
made it into this, into my, into my
slides, clear installation instructions.

12
00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.641
We showcase that.

13
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:48.400
You should use guidelines,
make sure you do that showcase on yours,

14
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.626
any guy eyes for contributors.

15
00:00:50.626 --> 00:00:53.890
Now, you might not have projects that
you want people to contribute to, but

16
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.191
you should still have guidelines for
contributors.

17
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.106
You never know what type of
tips you're gonna get, right?

18
00:01:00.106 --> 00:01:04.039
And that creates,
that turns your README and

19
00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.673
your repository into a networking tool.

20
00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:10.946
Now that I have, I'm opening up for
contributors and

21
00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:16.057
feedback either through the discussions or
through issues or whatever like that.

22
00:01:16.057 --> 00:01:19.504
I now have that opportunity
to get that feedback,

23
00:01:19.504 --> 00:01:24.690
unsolicited feedback to build onto my
project and make it better, right?

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.867
And that's what you want, I mean,
if someone's going to come and

25
00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:31.610
take the time and look at your code and
be like, hey, you should improve this,

26
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.858
I always take that feedback as a gift,
right?

27
00:01:33.858 --> 00:01:36.051
That's what you want, here's a free game.

28
00:01:36.051 --> 00:01:40.286
Yes, thank you, I'll take it and I'll
incorporate it and I'll add it to my code

29
00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:43.855
base and add it to my repository,
and I'll move forward with that.

30
00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:45.693
So I want you all to take five minutes,

31
00:01:45.693 --> 00:01:49.485
identify some great read-me's that you
would like, and then start thinking

32
00:01:49.485 --> 00:01:52.947
about how you're gonna copy those
to your own read-me style, right?

33
00:01:52.947 --> 00:01:57.226
Awesome README list is by Maddest Singers.

34
00:01:57.226 --> 00:02:02.222
It's a great README, it has a whole
list of good READMEs on here.

35
00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:09.792
This is a great resource to look at,
the, check out some good READMEs.

36
00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:12.498
Change log, generator, ease nav,

37
00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.177
it showcases all the good rules or
great READMEs.

38
00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:19.910
So don't, GitHub.com, backslash a.

39
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.543
Mathias Singers backslash awesome-README.

40
00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.570
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Thought
everybody enjoyed that,

41
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.736
did you do anything impactful for
your README?

42
00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.321
Awesome, yep, okay.

43
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:36.698
What about in the chat?

44
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.887
&gt;&gt; Student: Octavio says, yes, but

45
00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:44.003
where do you recommend putting
the images for the README?

46
00:02:44.003 --> 00:02:48.419
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I recommend at
the bottom just because I wanna lead with

47
00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.795
the how to get the product running
first versus the visual aids, so

48
00:02:53.795 --> 00:03:00.524
but the good thing is if they are looking
at your READMEs, you are winning, right?

49
00:03:00.524 --> 00:03:04.197
There you are in repos and READMEs,

50
00:03:04.197 --> 00:03:09.464
you have passed user zero,
you're past user one,

51
00:03:09.464 --> 00:03:13.749
you are now and
In your past user to you, so

52
00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:20.260
you are out of your own way the ATS
is giving you the thumbs up HR.

53
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.438
Is also like saying this
is a good candidate.

54
00:03:23.438 --> 00:03:26.658
So now you're in the end zone,
you're like, okay,

55
00:03:26.658 --> 00:03:31.466
the developers I hear, I am on what I
guess in sports, it'd be like third base.

56
00:03:31.466 --> 00:03:32.920
You go to your almost home, right?

57
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.989
You go to third base, that's like six.

58
00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.119
[LAUGH] It was like, why does this third
base have six rounds of third base?

59
00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:45.964
But you're still, you're a lot closer to
home than the person who is on first or

60
00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:49.467
hasn't gotten up to bat yet,
so that's good.
