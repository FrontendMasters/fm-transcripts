00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.590
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: The next thing
we're gonna talk about right here

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.397
is Modern Resume Optimization for
Applicant Tracking Systems, or ATS.

3
00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:10.610
You gonna see that acronym a lot.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.490
I view ATSs as the big bad for
juniors and seniors alike.

5
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.178
Cuz even if you have a robust network and

6
00:00:19.178 --> 00:00:24.241
someone can seeing your referral,
you still have to have a great resume.

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:29.642
You just can't sit there and send a piece
of paper with your name that says,

8
00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:32.575
my friend said I work well here, right?

9
00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:33.855
You can't do that.

10
00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:38.746
So you have to have
a modern robust resume.

11
00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:43.611
No more one to three pages, even if you're
a senior, stop at three pages, right?

12
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:48.136
Cuz there's no,
if you've been in tech past ten years,

13
00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:53.042
there is nothing from year one
that's probably applicable to

14
00:00:53.042 --> 00:00:58.159
the type of careers that you're
looking at in year ten, right?

15
00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.426
So that's what you have to think about as
well, so no more than three pages, make

16
00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:09.340
sure your note is diverse, it showcases,
remember, this is your highlight reel.

17
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.871
So what resumes are,

18
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:16.670
they are your highlight reel that starts
with data it ends with stories, right?

19
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.360
So let's go further into it.

20
00:01:21.388 --> 00:01:23.708
You have to showcase your
extensive experience.

21
00:01:24.928 --> 00:01:29.628
You have strong technical skills,
impressive achievements, leadership and

22
00:01:29.628 --> 00:01:30.688
collaboration.

23
00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:34.308
Your educational background,
if you have it.

24
00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:37.368
Now, there's a big debate that
if you're in a coed school,

25
00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:40.990
do you put down your education or
do you put that in and work?

26
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.879
I have a philosophy of you should
put it in educational background,

27
00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:51.838
but you can put anything that
you do that's open source or

28
00:01:51.838 --> 00:01:55.375
actually, like, contract into work.

29
00:01:55.375 --> 00:02:00.445
Which is why I am always pushing people
to do open source projects, right?

30
00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:05.773
The open source community is out there
to help you level up your game faster.

31
00:02:05.773 --> 00:02:10.581
Some people are like, put it in work cuz
it's one of those processes, especially go

32
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:14.963
to for-profit Code School, you're
gonna put in work when you paid them.

33
00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:21.653
It's kind of a weird flex but, whatever,
so, that's my picking on that.

34
00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:27.624
Continuous learning and certifications,
especially if you are mid to senior,

35
00:02:27.624 --> 00:02:32.386
people wanna see that you are still
out there learning, right?

36
00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:36.690
They wanna know that you're still
out there, you're not just sitting

37
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.583
on your laurels, not leveling up your
game, not stepping up your game, right?

38
00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:45.163
So you have to make sure that if
even if you don't have a degree,

39
00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:49.703
you're still showcasing, I'm still
out there learning new things, right?

40
00:02:51.623 --> 00:02:52.983
Recognition and awards.

41
00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:56.623
Now this, not everybody has these,
you can omit this if you don't have it.

42
00:02:56.623 --> 00:03:00.879
Diverse projects,
definitely showcase diverse projects,

43
00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.079
especially projects
that are in production.

44
00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.116
Remember, projects, I don't even call
them projects, we call them products,

45
00:03:09.116 --> 00:03:13.715
products that people are using outranks
projects that are in production,

46
00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:16.638
outranks projects that
are not in production.

47
00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:21.796
So, building a thing that
people use no matter how small

48
00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:29.054
is gonna get you further than building
a thing that is live that no one looks at.

49
00:03:29.054 --> 00:03:34.386
And that's gonna get you even further
in building a thing that is theory,

50
00:03:34.386 --> 00:03:36.468
that is not live, right?

51
00:03:36.468 --> 00:03:42.594
So, products projects, and then just coat
that doesn't live anywhere on the web,

52
00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:48.390
right, just repose, that's how you
should be ranking everything you built.

53
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.246
And you can start small, right?

54
00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:53.867
Some of the most popular projects, or

55
00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:58.848
products that have happened
in Vets Who Code are list

56
00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:02.922
on repose that just help
people do things or

57
00:04:02.922 --> 00:04:07.804
our web developer,
our web dev guide for Windows.

58
00:04:07.804 --> 00:04:11.972
It was shared with Microsoft, and
I don't have a Windows machine, so

59
00:04:11.972 --> 00:04:14.032
I didn't know anything about it.

60
00:04:14.032 --> 00:04:17.232
But everybody was like, hey, I wish this
was shared to me when I was learning

61
00:04:17.232 --> 00:04:20.495
JavaScript on Windows, and it ended
up getting over hundred stars, right?

62
00:04:20.495 --> 00:04:21.271
And like,

63
00:04:21.271 --> 00:04:26.799
random troop did that they end up getting
a job just because of that, right?

64
00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:32.658
So products that people can use, projects,
and then projects that are like just code,

65
00:04:32.658 --> 00:04:36.458
or you have to rank it based
upon the usefulness to users,

66
00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:39.617
because once people use it,
you get metrics.

67
00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:42.935
And when you get metrics,
you can add that to your resume,

68
00:04:42.935 --> 00:04:47.161
and it's like, this showcases you
know how to track value, right?

69
00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:51.519
Cuz that's what our resume is about
tracking and sharing our value.

70
00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:00.349
Volunteering and leadership, let's say
you volunteer for Black Girls Code.

71
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.911
Is there another organization,
what's the Last Mile Foundation,

72
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:12.121
which is a great foundation that Front
End Masters actually supports that helps

73
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:17.194
incarcerated people learn how to write
software, or Vets Who Code, right?

74
00:05:17.194 --> 00:05:21.995
That showcases that you're doing that
work and pouring back into community,

75
00:05:21.995 --> 00:05:25.280
particularly with your skill
set as an extra points.

76
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.719
People love looking at that type of stuff.

77
00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:34.379
And of course, publications, whether
you're self-publish your own blog, or

78
00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:39.557
you get some cool crazy stories that
you can share, publish went viral on.

79
00:05:39.557 --> 00:05:41.038
Was that not hacker rank?

80
00:05:41.038 --> 00:05:43.806
It's hacker news, yeah, there you go,

81
00:05:43.806 --> 00:05:47.377
that's the one with the bad
UI that programmers use.
