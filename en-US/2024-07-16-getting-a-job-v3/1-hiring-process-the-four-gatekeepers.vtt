1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.321
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: First thing that
I focus on is we have to know our

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:05.720
adversaries.

3
00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.350
We have to know the things
that we're working on.

4
00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.230
Now, I don't use adversaries
like a violent word.

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.510
I'm just military adversaries,
just, hey, yo, this is my opponent.

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.930
These are the things I had to prepare for,
right?

7
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.839
So what I have created, and
this is what I use in my troops.

8
00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:22.614
I call it the user matrix.

9
00:00:22.614 --> 00:00:29.680
My user matrix framework helps them and
helps me be able to identify the needs and

10
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.335
wants and tactics that we have to use for
each level.

11
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:38.385
Particularly for me, because I'm
coming in from outside in directly for

12
00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:41.801
every experience because I'm
not working on my experience.

13
00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:45.581
I'm working, I'm leveraging
someone else's experience, right?

14
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:49.611
So, my user matrix,
four components, my framework.

15
00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:54.549
This is where I start at every
day with every new troop,

16
00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:59.872
every new civilian, and I work through
these with every person, right?

17
00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:04.756
I'm actually gonna share with you later
on one of the project boards that I have

18
00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:06.541
that I share with my troops.

19
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.913
And I make them start answering these
questions, adding me as a collaborator so

20
00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:12.818
I can learn part of this with them.

21
00:01:14.677 --> 00:01:16.337
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: My first user,
User Zero,

22
00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:19.846
because programmers start
counting at zero, right?

23
00:01:19.846 --> 00:01:20.756
Is you.

24
00:01:20.756 --> 00:01:22.306
You're the first user.

25
00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:26.598
What I've learned in ten years of
experience is that if I can get you to

26
00:01:26.598 --> 00:01:28.744
focus on your personal passions.

27
00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:33.312
And how to figure out what makes you
click when it comes to this type of

28
00:01:33.312 --> 00:01:36.280
industry particularly in times like this,

29
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.145
you're not going to survive,
you're not going to win.

30
00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:45.223
So my number one priority at this
stage is to see what is in tech

31
00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:50.001
that makes you wanna A,
be in tech, B, thriving tech and

32
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:55.011
how to make make you stand
out from your constituents.

33
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:58.461
Also out to get that mental toughness and
grit for

34
00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:01.163
when the markets crazy hard, right?

35
00:02:01.163 --> 00:02:02.225
Like it is right now.

36
00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:05.546
So that is my first user
on every conversation and

37
00:02:05.546 --> 00:02:08.225
that should be your first user as well.

38
00:02:08.225 --> 00:02:09.275
Start with you.

39
00:02:09.275 --> 00:02:12.194
Start with what are the things
that you wanna do?

40
00:02:12.194 --> 00:02:16.869
I have my own personal philosophy,
including I have what is called a 5 AM

41
00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:21.176
rule, which is what is the type of
tech that I would love to work on.

42
00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:25.808
If somebody called me,
there was an outage at 5 AM, I wouldn't be

43
00:02:25.808 --> 00:02:31.036
super mad if I had to go roll out a bit
and build on this stuff right now.

44
00:02:31.036 --> 00:02:34.356
You can have your own personal philosophy,
right?

45
00:02:34.356 --> 00:02:38.269
But that is what User Zero is about.

46
00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.881
It's dive in deep and focusing on,
all right, who you are.

47
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:46.997
So that way we can build projects
around the things you care about.

48
00:02:46.997 --> 00:02:51.037
So that way no one's sharing the same
three pit league projects, right?

49
00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:56.007
It's saying, here's a JavaScript
calculator, here's a Netflix clone and

50
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.852
what is the other most popular
project that you see with junior?

51
00:02:59.852 --> 00:03:03.123
These days, Netflix clone,
Jaws calculator, and.

52
00:03:03.123 --> 00:03:03.923
&gt;&gt; Student: To do list.

53
00:03:03.923 --> 00:03:05.216
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: To do list,
there you go.

54
00:03:05.216 --> 00:03:08.052
Those are the top three that
you see in your life, okay?

55
00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:12.122
That's that doesn't really apply and
then you have seen this a million times.

56
00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:12.919
What are we gonna do?

57
00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.443
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Now
this is the scary one for

58
00:03:17.443 --> 00:03:22.198
those that don't have network's either
let's say you've been in tech so

59
00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:27.188
long, you haven't been really focusing
on your network has been saying job.

60
00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:31.421
Or you're just now breaking into tech
ATS which is applicant tracking systems.

61
00:03:31.421 --> 00:03:34.866
Let's now talk about the big
man in the room, workday we

62
00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:39.578
all hate workday combined, workday is,
I'll never be sponsored by them.

63
00:03:39.578 --> 00:03:44.492
[LAUGH] So, those are the applicant
tracking systems that focus on

64
00:03:44.492 --> 00:03:47.811
key word technical skill identification.

65
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:51.031
They have artificial
intelligence built into them,

66
00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:55.396
whereas they start focusing on what
words and what resumes start getting

67
00:03:55.396 --> 00:03:59.205
the most success rates starting and
hired from those clients.

68
00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:03.638
Stores dwindling down, and
you have to start getting it started and

69
00:04:03.638 --> 00:04:06.840
get smarter and
more difficult at the same time.

70
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.210
So you have to get you have to
beat the machine in the sun game.

71
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.242
So that is user one, where we do
this is we focus on our resumes.

72
00:04:14.242 --> 00:04:18.184
We focus on updating our resumes
based upon those components and

73
00:04:18.184 --> 00:04:20.818
we constantly we evolve with the machine?

74
00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:21.805
Yes, sir.

75
00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:26.507
&gt;&gt; Student: Are there any websites or
tools to analyze

76
00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:31.619
your resume to pull out what it's seeing?.

77
00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:35.544
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Cool, so I have my own
resume GPT that I can actually make public

78
00:04:35.544 --> 00:04:37.187
and share it with people.

79
00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:42.047
It does want to, but I have tested
three different companies and

80
00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:45.828
the company that works
the best right now is Teal.

81
00:04:45.828 --> 00:04:49.010
Teal is the best tool out there.

82
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.997
&gt;&gt; Student: How do you spell that?

83
00:04:49.997 --> 00:04:51.345
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: T-E-A-L.

84
00:04:53.697 --> 00:04:56.448
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: That's the best
tool out there for your resumes.

85
00:04:56.448 --> 00:04:59.371
If you're for
resume tracking and cleaning up,

86
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:04.363
making sure as metric based all the things
that are evolving with the current market

87
00:05:04.363 --> 00:05:09.017
that is the best resource that I've
seen if you're gonna pay for a resource.

88
00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:10.989
That's what I recommend.

89
00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:15.467
User two, HR managers now, two years ago,

90
00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:20.551
HR managers were fun because
the cash was flush and

91
00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:25.875
they could just throw a job
out there with like 20,

92
00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:31.828
30% more money than what the job is and
pick up whoever.

93
00:05:31.828 --> 00:05:34.671
And they get their percentage,
you get your percentage.

94
00:05:34.671 --> 00:05:35.731
Everybody's happy, right?

95
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:40.539
Well, 2022 happened and
they were one of the first people

96
00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.631
that were cut in the culling of
markets when it came to companies.

97
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:47.474
And those that stayed,

98
00:05:47.474 --> 00:05:53.705
they are having to be very stark stewards
of the jobs and the budget, right?

99
00:05:53.705 --> 00:06:00.356
So they're not as fun as they used to
be one and two they're looking for

100
00:06:00.356 --> 00:06:06.240
more false positives than
negatives in the market right now.

101
00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.014
So these are the things where your
clarity, your organization and

102
00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:16.990
your professionalism is
getting the one and done rule.

103
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.245
We're I see a typo,
I'm not gonna use this person's,

104
00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:25.039
we're not gonna hire this person they're
trying to find ways to disqualify you.

105
00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.124
And the disqualifications are minor and

106
00:06:28.124 --> 00:06:33.022
insignificant right now in this
market because how tight it is to

107
00:06:33.022 --> 00:06:37.570
right now the talent is talent rich,
but job poor, right?

108
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.135
So they have to find the best client or
best talent for this woman,

109
00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:45.455
take the job based upon that,
that salary, and

110
00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:51.098
they're disqualifying people on
the smallest things, unfortunately.

111
00:06:51.098 --> 00:06:56.004
So we have to focus on being sharper
as well as they are also using

112
00:06:56.004 --> 00:06:57.588
artificial tools.

113
00:06:57.588 --> 00:07:02.139
A lot of HR managers are using a lot
of sentiment analysis tools to try to

114
00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:04.780
figure out not only on that first call.

115
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.620
I don't know if you have gone
through an interview with HR Manager

116
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.946
in a recent time.

117
00:07:10.946 --> 00:07:14.550
But they are using phone technology
to own the door and to call for

118
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.155
sentiment analysis to AC if you're lying
and to C, to pick up if you're nervous,

119
00:07:19.155 --> 00:07:24.189
confident, what is your emotional status
while you're talking to them, right?

120
00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.780
And then they're also
having that recording and

121
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.519
having other team members listen before
they move on to the second round, right?

122
00:07:31.519 --> 00:07:33.939
So this is the new game.

123
00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:37.918
So one of the things that you're gonna
have to do that we're gonna go further

124
00:07:37.918 --> 00:07:41.729
into is you're gonna have to practice
your interview skills a lot more.

125
00:07:41.729 --> 00:07:44.213
Particularly your elevator pitch and

126
00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:49.178
just practicing how you speak to people
in general, because that's part of

127
00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:53.613
the new interview phase when it
comes to artificial intelligence.

128
00:07:53.613 --> 00:07:55.421
&gt;&gt; Student: Any tips for
staying confident?

129
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:59.818
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Practice,
biggest tip is practice,

130
00:07:59.818 --> 00:08:04.769
one you have to understand that
the person on the other side of

131
00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:09.434
that line doesn't know you
as well as you know you.

132
00:08:09.434 --> 00:08:12.523
So, make sure that you're a,
practicing the pitch,

133
00:08:12.523 --> 00:08:17.304
practicing the things that you want to say
that's gonna make you stand out, right?

134
00:08:17.304 --> 00:08:21.510
Practice ensuring that you have
your metrics, is very metric based.

135
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.380
Right now, they wanna to see
not only what you've built, but

136
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.688
what was the impact of his building,

137
00:08:27.688 --> 00:08:32.762
even if you're a junior like which is why
building in public is so important now.

138
00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:37.273
Because you know how many users have
touched your has touched your portfolio?

139
00:08:37.273 --> 00:08:40.684
How many are you getting feedback?

140
00:08:40.684 --> 00:08:41.759
How are you handling feedback?

141
00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:42.375
Things like that.

142
00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:44.015
So that is what you do.

143
00:08:44.015 --> 00:08:45.305
You just have to practice.

144
00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:48.691
You have to keep practicing,
get your pitch down,

145
00:08:48.691 --> 00:08:51.065
understand how to tell your story.

146
00:08:51.065 --> 00:08:53.329
And also, like I said, remember,

147
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:57.085
this person does not know you
better than you know you.

148
00:08:57.085 --> 00:09:02.228
So you don't have to be nervous,
be confident in your skills right?

149
00:09:02.228 --> 00:09:05.823
In the military,
we have a saying that confidence,

150
00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:10.739
like confidence nervousness comes
from lack of preparation, right?

151
00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:13.890
So the more prepared more you prepare,
the more you practice,

152
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.278
the less nervous you're going to
be right because that nervousness

153
00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:20.398
comes from things external
that you can't control.

154
00:09:20.398 --> 00:09:25.358
I can control with the things I know about
me that I'm gonna tell a person, right?

155
00:09:25.358 --> 00:09:29.837
So I'm gonna practice that, and
I'm gonna get better at that, right?

156
00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:33.846
Now developer teams used to be,
though, unless you're getting for

157
00:09:33.846 --> 00:09:37.716
the magnificent seven,
you were gonna go through a three, four,

158
00:09:37.716 --> 00:09:40.776
five round inner process,
right with a developer.

159
00:09:40.776 --> 00:09:45.599
Now, in this current market,
it's very normal to go through

160
00:09:45.599 --> 00:09:49.412
multiple rounds and
have multiple developers.

161
00:09:49.412 --> 00:09:54.652
I have seen at least two that's for
pre IPO startups where,

162
00:09:54.652 --> 00:09:57.563
you have to do the code challenge and

163
00:09:57.563 --> 00:10:03.014
then you'd have to do multiple
round interview with the dev team.

164
00:10:03.014 --> 00:10:07.676
And that is very different when we
were getting two years ago right

165
00:10:07.676 --> 00:10:10.558
unless you are going for the Microsoft,

166
00:10:10.558 --> 00:10:15.335
the videos, apples of the world
it was a three interview process.

167
00:10:15.335 --> 00:10:21.298
And then you were like okay cool now it's
five, six rounds for the interview and

168
00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:26.829
the developer team is playing a much more,
much more hands on role for it.

169
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:29.711
So with these,
they want to see if you're a team member,

170
00:10:29.711 --> 00:10:33.734
how you collaborate as a unit, how do
you communicate, and of course, focus on

171
00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:38.379
technical skills in this era where
everybody's focusing on productivity.

172
00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:46.010
The harsh reality is the things that are
being pushed away is how do we onboard?

173
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.428
Two years ago, onboarding was such
an important, holistic approach.

174
00:10:49.428 --> 00:10:52.586
And now we're seeing, because
everybody's trying to move fast, and

175
00:10:52.586 --> 00:10:56.232
particularly in this current era where
we're trying to adopt new technologies.

176
00:10:56.232 --> 00:11:00.958
They don't want to have to spend the time
onboarding you in a company onboarding you

177
00:11:00.958 --> 00:11:03.130
into the stack as much as they used to.

178
00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.074
And while that is a detriment to
the talent, the current market,

179
00:11:07.074 --> 00:11:10.888
that's the world we live in and
we have to be prepared for that.

180
00:11:10.888 --> 00:11:15.782
So you have to, and I'm also seeing
a lot more computer science, questions,

181
00:11:15.782 --> 00:11:20.838
a lot more, complexity and talking about
performance within code challenges.

182
00:11:20.838 --> 00:11:24.388
So we have to start planning and
practicing for

183
00:11:24.388 --> 00:11:29.698
that when we're building out
our plans to get on the market.

184
00:11:29.698 --> 00:11:33.738
So the matrix is a strategy of improving
how you present well for your work.

185
00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:37.818
And also how to continuously
present well for yourself, right?

186
00:11:37.818 --> 00:11:41.908
I used to matrix on myself
regularly to build my projects,

187
00:11:41.908 --> 00:11:45.591
to build what am I gonna
build next externally?

188
00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:47.040
How am I gonna explain it?

189
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.481
What is my next career step, etc, right?

190
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:53.091
So that's how I focus.

191
00:11:53.091 --> 00:11:56.831
I use the user matrix on me to focus
on how to prepare well for the market.

192
00:11:56.831 --> 00:12:02.032
I want you to start using the user matrix
for you to enhance your professional

193
00:12:02.032 --> 00:12:06.967
success and your chances and
keep it going for yourself, right?

194
00:12:06.967 --> 00:12:10.807
That is one of the biggest things
that I want you all to take away.

195
00:12:10.807 --> 00:12:16.677
This right here is the core foundation
of my style of self-improvement,

196
00:12:16.677 --> 00:12:22.656
as well as helping my troops and
helping big civilians that I help, right?

197
00:12:22.656 --> 00:12:26.994
Keeping a nice long career I'm
always assessing, starting here and

198
00:12:26.994 --> 00:12:29.836
assessing with these
things with every job,

199
00:12:29.836 --> 00:12:33.707
even the job I'm at currently
I'm looking at all right.

200
00:12:33.707 --> 00:12:36.828
When I think about the developer
teams I'm looking at okay,

201
00:12:36.828 --> 00:12:39.705
what developer teams aren't
being impacted by fire and

202
00:12:39.705 --> 00:12:42.798
what it is skills that those
developer teams at work have.

203
00:12:42.798 --> 00:12:46.618
And what do I need to do to quickly
upskill on those skills, right?

204
00:12:46.618 --> 00:12:51.003
When Microsoft two years ago was
starting talking about AI and

205
00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:54.383
big data,
I started learning Python on my own.

206
00:12:54.383 --> 00:12:57.785
Because in case things
changed drastically,

207
00:12:57.785 --> 00:13:02.152
I wanted to be able to say,
hey, I already have this skill.

208
00:13:02.152 --> 00:13:06.537
So I can go over here and do big data and
do data engineering, and that helped me

209
00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:10.451
not only with one of our projects
where we had to do data engineering,

210
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:12.701
cuz I was already upskilled in Python.

211
00:13:12.701 --> 00:13:17.298
It also helped me prepare for
the current era AI since JavaScript and

212
00:13:17.298 --> 00:13:22.366
Python are two of the most popular
languages in this space right now.

213
00:13:22.366 --> 00:13:27.252
So that is how I might even in my
current role planned out how hey,

214
00:13:27.252 --> 00:13:29.063
based upon user three,

215
00:13:29.063 --> 00:13:34.060
what do I need to do user three
been developer teams at Microsoft?

216
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.697
What is the business
line looking focusing on?

217
00:13:36.697 --> 00:13:41.114
Hey, this is what the business line is
paying the developer teams to do And

218
00:13:41.114 --> 00:13:45.115
these are the safest teams,
let me acquire these skills, right?

219
00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:49.284
So like even when you're at your current
job, you can be using the metrics.
