1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.215
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: We're gonna start
getting into the GitHub portion of things,

2
00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:06.976
and we are gonna get into what I view
the most underused feature on GitHub,

3
00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:08.870
which is the GitHub Projects Board.

4
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.064
This is a military statement.

5
00:00:10.064 --> 00:00:13.984
You failed a plan, plan failed,
that's what Project Voice is about.

6
00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:18.401
It's about building out your plan,
I go there and

7
00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:21.767
I'm starting to build out tickets and

8
00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:25.792
gonna process of how do
I plan my questions?

9
00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:26.631
How do I plan my career?

10
00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:27.982
How do I plan my learning?

11
00:00:27.982 --> 00:00:32.406
Everything, this is something that is,
that you can make public and

12
00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:36.146
you can showcase via GitHub profiles,
via your website,

13
00:00:36.146 --> 00:00:39.142
anything in real time,
and show your growth.

14
00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:46.618
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So we're gonna focus
on understanding it, send up our board,

15
00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:52.530
documentation and visibility, analytics
and storytelling, and best practices.

16
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.285
Like I said, this is about
showcasing your work ethic, right?

17
00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:59.479
Especially for the juniors out there who
are like, how do I show what I'm learning?

18
00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.705
All right, so now we're into user two,
user three, showcasing,

19
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:05.946
not only we know we're doing,
but we're keeping growth, right?

20
00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:09.416
Or even if you're mid or senior, right,
we wanna showcase how I'm growing,

21
00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.318
how I'm learning.

22
00:01:10.318 --> 00:01:13.498
People always have that question,
especially at Microsoft,

23
00:01:13.498 --> 00:01:16.024
who we have that learn it all philosophy,
right?

24
00:01:16.024 --> 00:01:19.091
So you're always talking about,
all right, you wanna be a learn it all.

25
00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.647
How do you upskill,
how do you learn something new, right?

26
00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:26.058
Well, this helps with you showcasing that
framework, how I learned something new.

27
00:01:26.058 --> 00:01:26.600
Let's go here.

28
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.799
Let's go to the project board and showcase
what's on my list of things to do and

29
00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.374
showcase my volume of what I've done and
how I learned it, right?

30
00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:38.447
Does this tool come with
a free GitHub account?

31
00:01:38.447 --> 00:01:43.021
Yes, it does, it is free.

32
00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:48.221
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Let me go,
profile is right here.

33
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:52.362
And this tab right here projects,
your overview your repositories, projects,

34
00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.984
packages, stars and
what you're sponsoring.

35
00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:56.476
It's right there in the middle.

36
00:01:56.476 --> 00:02:00.503
You're right here,
it says I have six closed.

37
00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:04.082
These are the six ones, portfolio board,

38
00:02:04.082 --> 00:02:08.467
bunch of play ones that
I've been practicing with.

39
00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:11.203
But let's go to the one
that I want you all to use.

40
00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:15.637
This is a template,
you can take this template, share it.

41
00:02:15.637 --> 00:02:20.315
This is the one that I recommend
you every junior starts off with,

42
00:02:20.315 --> 00:02:24.412
this is how I do my death
persona questions for user zero.

43
00:02:24.412 --> 00:02:28.789
And from user zero, I can help you
build out anything and get you a job.

44
00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:32.696
From user zero, I know what
projects I can help you build with,

45
00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:35.291
how to start mapping out your portfolio.

46
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:40.588
How to start with your resume,
with these dev persona questions,

47
00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:43.624
17 questions that I ask everybody.

48
00:02:43.624 --> 00:02:47.918
And then I go from there and
we start building out the plan.

49
00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:49.753
Your objective is modify and

50
00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:54.116
adapt this project board to better
fit your specific, like goals.

51
00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:56.510
This first project is you.

52
00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.341
So I have 17 questions on there at three
things that you would like your mentor to

53
00:03:01.341 --> 00:03:03.907
ask you to the project board, right?

54
00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:06.352
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Is this considered public or
is there a way to,

55
00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:10.873
while you're in progress and you're maybe
not really proud of what you're doing yet

56
00:03:10.873 --> 00:03:12.145
because of process-.

57
00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:13.436
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yes,
it starts private.

58
00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:14.614
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: And you can make

59
00:03:14.614 --> 00:03:15.170
public.

60
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.062
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I always recommend,

61
00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:22.038
while I recommend building in public I
was you know building in public when

62
00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:25.181
you're ready is also
a very important thing.

63
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:29.049
Especially, you don't
wanna mess around and

64
00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.974
I don't know put some like PII out
there or something like that right?

65
00:03:34.974 --> 00:03:37.846
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Yeah, and also just want
to make feel free to make mistakes.

66
00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:39.539
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Of course,
but mistakes are,

67
00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:43.973
people hate on making mistakes and you
should absolutely make mistakes probably

68
00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:48.072
when it comes to code cuz that helps you,
that shows growth, right?

69
00:03:48.072 --> 00:03:50.102
So, adventure time said it best,

70
00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:55.077
the first step of being kind of good at
something's being bad at something, right?

71
00:03:55.077 --> 00:03:58.656
So, Jake taught us all that.

72
00:03:58.656 --> 00:03:59.685
Yes, sir.

73
00:03:59.685 --> 00:04:04.455
&gt;&gt; Student 2: You recommend going
through this with a mentor, right?

74
00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:04.980
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yeah, so

75
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.539
the mentor add them as a collaborator
if you wanna go through it.

76
00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:12.473
But right now,
I want to see you add three tickets to it.

77
00:04:12.473 --> 00:04:17.318
So go to the Issues component,
add three tickets, or just add one,

78
00:04:17.318 --> 00:04:19.339
and then we'll ask you.

79
00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.670
We'll see how you can fit through it.

80
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.725
So, what I'm saying,
what I'm referring to,

81
00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:32.303
go here, after you make it your own,

82
00:04:32.303 --> 00:04:38.375
add an item, and add,
let's say if it's me to,

83
00:04:48.918 --> 00:04:49.824
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: If I was brand new,

84
00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:51.470
that would be the first question,

85
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.076
that would be one of the questions
I want someone to ask me, right?

86
00:04:55.076 --> 00:04:57.907
Is adding that ticket not come here?

87
00:05:00.488 --> 00:05:05.198
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Edit,
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Description.

88
00:05:08.032 --> 00:05:10.997
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: As a veteran,

89
00:05:10.997 --> 00:05:16.185
I would like to know how to

90
00:05:16.185 --> 00:05:21.622
apply my military service

91
00:05:21.622 --> 00:05:26.563
as a part of my resume and

92
00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:29.788
my job search.

93
00:05:32.197 --> 00:05:39.316
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Criteria,
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Showcase

94
00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:44.847
my work should guess my work ethic

95
00:05:44.847 --> 00:05:51.167
while not impacting any of the mission

96
00:05:51.167 --> 00:05:56.451
oriented,
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Not get

97
00:05:56.451 --> 00:06:01.399
in trouble with the government.

98
00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:06.268
That was like the number one thing when
I was coming out that I was terrified of

99
00:06:06.268 --> 00:06:10.547
cuz I still had IRR and I was like,
I don't wanna mess up my secret.

100
00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:19.719
My secret clearance and
accidentally say something

101
00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:25.356
I'm not supposed to say, so, priority
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Can't

102
00:06:25.356 --> 00:06:30.357
spell,
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: High update and

103
00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:34.139
there we go, I added my first ticket.

104
00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:41.063
So that's what I'm, after you all get the
template, add your first, add a ticket.

105
00:06:46.442 --> 00:06:49.247
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: We've already
identified our auditation needs.

106
00:06:49.247 --> 00:06:51.265
We're reflecting on the structure and

107
00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:55.112
content of how that template allies
with our own projects and goals.

108
00:06:55.112 --> 00:06:57.733
Good job on making one for
your project as well.

109
00:06:57.733 --> 00:07:02.397
That I'm not gonna bug you on your
personal project cuz it's like a mech app

110
00:07:02.397 --> 00:07:06.191
and I'm like you don't want me
going through your code doc.

111
00:07:06.191 --> 00:07:12.416
I'm not a fun person going through your
code and altering those automation rules.

112
00:07:12.416 --> 00:07:17.019
And I think you should do that play with
that, play with the GitHub projects.

113
00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:20.292
I liked seeing people make
their own because you wanna be

114
00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:24.054
able to see what works for you,
what's gonna show your volume,

115
00:07:24.054 --> 00:07:28.268
especially when it comes to
the insights and that graph.

116
00:07:28.268 --> 00:07:33.142
That graph is when you're talking about
interviewing one, I've had an interview

117
00:07:33.142 --> 00:07:37.179
this year just informational and
I was showing them like my volume and

118
00:07:37.179 --> 00:07:39.706
graph cuz I do so
much work on that sue code.

119
00:07:39.706 --> 00:07:42.753
They're like okay,
you're building this ticket,

120
00:07:42.753 --> 00:07:46.069
you're dealing things with AI,
things are JavaScript,

121
00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.888
doing things Python, you're all over
the place and you're constantly learning.

122
00:07:50.888 --> 00:07:55.036
You're already on LLM compression and we
don't even know what that is yet, right?

123
00:07:55.036 --> 00:07:59.207
So that is what you wanna be able
to show that just in the tickets

124
00:07:59.207 --> 00:08:02.898
without even showing code,
what you're working on,

125
00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:07.408
it tells a great story when you're
in those interview processes.

126
00:08:07.408 --> 00:08:11.261
And I've had two informationals
turn to full scale interviews and

127
00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:13.943
then turn into offer
letters this year just for

128
00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:17.958
me personally that I've turned out,
so I know, some of this stuff.

129
00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:25.238
This stuff works, you can absolutely
use project boards to get a job and

130
00:08:25.238 --> 00:08:29.254
get into the get into the final rounds.
