00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.107
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So
I break it down with my jobs and

2
00:00:02.107 --> 00:00:06.885
making sure I have all that metric
based stuff, now I have my education.

3
00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:11.096
I skip this because my
education doesn't matter.

4
00:00:11.096 --> 00:00:16.893
I just leave it out immediately, when it
comes to college cuz I have a criminal

5
00:00:16.893 --> 00:00:22.706
justice degree from light through this
Community College Air Force and FSU.

6
00:00:22.706 --> 00:00:27.361
No, only time I use that thing
is when I'm trying to figure

7
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.976
out who gave the dogs
too many treats at home.

8
00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:34.808
Literally, which child
is overfeeding the dogs,

9
00:00:34.808 --> 00:00:38.915
it's the only time I have to,
actually use my degree.

10
00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:43.208
So that is where that it ends right there.

11
00:00:43.208 --> 00:00:50.153
Four boys figuring out like detective
work on who's, over treating the dogs.

12
00:00:50.153 --> 00:00:51.403
What I do add though,

13
00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:55.571
I do add all of my certifications
because particularly in this market,

14
00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:59.751
if you're a junior entry level or
getting back into the market tenure.

15
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:04.954
The certifications help,
they give a lot less time than

16
00:01:04.954 --> 00:01:09.942
going back to school full time or
as low as a boot camp.

17
00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:13.171
They're more centered on
the technology directly and

18
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.885
they give you more credibility and more
chances there's more foot in the door.

19
00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:21.153
Four years ago you asked
me about certifications or

20
00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:26.098
certifications cuz he did experience,
right, being able to talk about it.

21
00:01:26.098 --> 00:01:30.956
But now in his current market,
you do need certifications.

22
00:01:30.956 --> 00:01:36.362
Now people asked me what type of certs,
the way I look at certifications right now

23
00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:42.103
is, you need to go directly to the company
of whatever thing you're trying to start.

24
00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:45.785
If you're gonna try to get certified,
I want something cloud, and

25
00:01:45.785 --> 00:01:49.220
you don't know which cloud
you're gonna do, you do CompTIA.

26
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.480
I hate to say it,

27
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.342
I don't feel like CompTIA is getting
you as far as other certifications are.

28
00:01:56.342 --> 00:02:00.310
But if you're gonna have to pick one,
go AWS, go Azure,

29
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.452
go directly to Microsoft or
directly to AWS,

30
00:02:03.452 --> 00:02:09.176
get those certifications from them so
that way you have that legitimacy, right?

31
00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:14.097
Awards and recognition, you have awards
and recognition at work, do it please.

32
00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:18.302
If you have a word recognition
in your community that's

33
00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:22.955
affiliated with your job,
do it as well, even if it's just or

34
00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:26.902
if they're big awards in your city,
also add them.

35
00:02:26.902 --> 00:02:32.729
My first couple awards had nothing
to do with my job, but they were so

36
00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:38.368
big that if I didn't add them on
my resume, it'd be kinda weird.

37
00:02:38.368 --> 00:02:43.553
Because your people, they Google
you when they, research you and

38
00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:50.606
the biggest problem I would have, I was
omit things and then, drums 40 under 40.

39
00:02:50.606 --> 00:02:52.525
It's, why did you not
put that on your resume?

40
00:02:52.525 --> 00:02:54.942
It's, didn't matter [LAUGH].

41
00:02:54.942 --> 00:03:00.278
But now I know better and I know,
let me put that on my resume so

42
00:03:00.278 --> 00:03:04.265
it doesn't pop up, or something like that.

43
00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:09.067
I make sure, but I'm also much better in
controlling the things that are on my in

44
00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:10.725
my SEO on the Internet now.

45
00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.528
So all my stuff is tech related, so

46
00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:18.375
I put that directly in my awards and
recognition projects.

47
00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:23.361
Now here is what we get into a problem
when it comes to the most mid and

48
00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:24.711
senior, right?

49
00:03:24.711 --> 00:03:26.856
Juniors, we already know their problem,
right?

50
00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:30.840
They don't have enough meaty projects,
but mid and senior,

51
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.525
they have projects that they
can't talk about, right?

52
00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:40.070
We've all been in a situation where
the bulk of our work can't be discussed,

53
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.680
right?

54
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.303
Unless you're in e-commerce or

55
00:03:45.303 --> 00:03:49.104
you're in media, right?

56
00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:52.299
Especially, or if you're in government,
you can't really talk about a lot of

57
00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.649
the projects that you're on
a lot of the things you built.

58
00:03:54.649 --> 00:04:00.557
So what I recommend is sanitizing
those projects, all right?

59
00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:05.271
And then turn around and
talk about exactly what you build.

60
00:04:05.271 --> 00:04:10.980
We did a project at work with
Kroger that it was sanitized

61
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.211
on my resume until Kroger
did a whole article on it.

62
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:19.593
Then I was, now that Kroger
has said something about it,

63
00:04:19.593 --> 00:04:23.184
I'm gonna say something about it and
add it to my resume, right?

64
00:04:23.184 --> 00:04:27.085
It's saying wait, as long as
the till the companies say something

65
00:04:27.085 --> 00:04:31.472
about what we're doing, I don't say
anything about, I sanitize it, but

66
00:04:31.472 --> 00:04:34.625
I keep that work that I've
done on my resume, right?

67
00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:40.508
And I talked about I talk about how the
value that I brought within the project,

68
00:04:40.508 --> 00:04:45.696
you have to talk about the project and
the value and the data, right?

69
00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:48.592
This is a data-driven, world.

70
00:04:48.592 --> 00:04:53.639
Even if I have e-commerce platform,
I have a million transactions

71
00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.392
a month because we are dealing with
a robot, with your resume the first time,

72
00:04:59.392 --> 00:05:04.192
I am going to have a list of my skills,
plain and simple, right?

73
00:05:04.192 --> 00:05:08.118
For those keywords,
because I can't put everything,

74
00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:14.147
especially if I have technologies that I'm
still proficient in the past 10 years.

75
00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:19.291
I might not put them in here,
because I'm assuming that you know this,

76
00:05:19.291 --> 00:05:24.552
that I'm doing this cuz it's a part
of tech, we can't assume, right?

77
00:05:24.552 --> 00:05:30.905
I can't sit here and assume that
because for all technologists in here,

78
00:05:30.905 --> 00:05:34.770
we know version control is a thing, right?

79
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.976
The robot it's not gonna assume
that I know version control,

80
00:05:39.976 --> 00:05:44.379
that I know GitHub or
I'm using GitLab or what is it,

81
00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.398
a subversion or
something like that out there.

82
00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:50.893
So it's not going to assume that, right?

83
00:05:50.893 --> 00:05:54.165
It's not gonna assume what
text editor that I use,

84
00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:57.892
I'm gonna put I,
use VS code is my workflow, use GitHub,

85
00:05:57.892 --> 00:06:02.173
I'm gonna talk about the tools I
use a lot have Docker experience.

86
00:06:02.173 --> 00:06:09.342
I do a lot of infrastructure as code and
I make sure I say, I don't use acronyms.

87
00:06:09.342 --> 00:06:12.495
I try my best to still do
everything you can to stay away

88
00:06:12.495 --> 00:06:17.418
from acronyms on your resume, and you have
IAC that means nothing to the computer.

89
00:06:17.418 --> 00:06:20.900
Infrastructure is code though,
that means something,

90
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.118
that's a keyword term that means
something to the machine, right?

91
00:06:25.118 --> 00:06:29.167
Then when it sees that and it starts
looking for what tools that you've used,

92
00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:31.740
cuz it's gonna go to your skills or
your Docker.

93
00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.597
You got Kubernetes, you have Jenkins,
you have all these, you have AWS Azure,

94
00:06:35.597 --> 00:06:39.815
you have these tools on here, they're also
gonna be used with infrastructure as code.

95
00:06:39.815 --> 00:06:41.657
Now that's starting to make sense, right?

96
00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:48.026
Make sure you have your skills on here and
you're not using any unless their comment.

97
00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:53.053
If I'm gonna use Postgres SQL or
SQL, however way you say it,

98
00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:57.808
I don't whatever,
I'm not gonna argue with you on that.

99
00:06:57.808 --> 00:07:01.675
That's one that I'm gonna use it on.

100
00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:07.206
That's my first database I ever learned.

101
00:07:07.206 --> 00:07:11.623
And funny story DARPA actually funded
the creation of that with Stanford,

102
00:07:11.623 --> 00:07:13.527
so it has military background.

103
00:07:13.527 --> 00:07:17.598
So and I also put yourself skills, right?

104
00:07:17.598 --> 00:07:19.123
Leadership, communication,

105
00:07:19.123 --> 00:07:23.243
problem solving, team collaboration, I put
leadership on mine all the time because I

106
00:07:23.243 --> 00:07:25.395
do a lot of leadership
work in volunteering.

107
00:07:25.395 --> 00:07:30.403
So I was vets who code, so people see that
and I wanna make sure they know that I

108
00:07:30.403 --> 00:07:35.752
know how to lead even at the lowest level,
even at a social impact level, right?

109
00:07:35.752 --> 00:07:37.479
I have that leadership ability.

110
00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:42.755
Your local tech meet ups, I think
that's coming back now, after a couple

111
00:07:42.755 --> 00:07:47.704
of years due to COVID, people
are starting to meet up more in public.

112
00:07:47.704 --> 00:07:51.933
I'm actually a big fan of going to
your local tech meet ups, doing talks,

113
00:07:51.933 --> 00:07:56.109
that's one thing that helps your
imposter syndrome starting locally.

114
00:07:56.109 --> 00:07:59.479
Asking for feedback going in there and
it helps you network as well, right?

115
00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:02.655
People help you work on
your things while there.

116
00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:07.155
I think local,
tech meet ups should have a section where

117
00:08:07.155 --> 00:08:12.042
they're just doing job prep
because that's something that

118
00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:17.046
would make those local tech
meet ups more impactful, right?

119
00:08:17.046 --> 00:08:22.004
And of course, publications, even if
it's your own blog, if it's something

120
00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:26.519
that was popular that you may wanna
make them the listen, write or read.

121
00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:31.483
I have always put a publication or
something I wrote on my portfolio,

122
00:08:31.483 --> 00:08:35.761
I mean on my resume, even if I
wrote it and it was on medium and

123
00:08:35.761 --> 00:08:38.943
no one cared to the,
now where I do write it.

124
00:08:38.943 --> 00:08:41.947
I can write an external thing and
someone might be, yeah,

125
00:08:41.947 --> 00:08:44.783
we're gonna put that out in the world and
people care.

126
00:08:44.783 --> 00:08:48.278
Always show people that you're
always trying to share knowledge.

127
00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:52.841
Always, that's why we have people always
asking for your Stack Overflow or

128
00:08:52.841 --> 00:08:55.704
they used to,
I don't know if they do that now.

129
00:08:55.704 --> 00:08:59.091
But I know now, five,
six years ago, he said always,

130
00:08:59.091 --> 00:09:03.305
hey at your Stack Overflow at your
LinkedIn at your GitHub, right?

131
00:09:03.305 --> 00:09:06.999
But the reason they were asking for
your Stack Overflow is to see how you

132
00:09:06.999 --> 00:09:10.706
communicate it and how you shared
knowledge to other people, right?

133
00:09:10.706 --> 00:09:15.817
So blogging is a way of doing that
blogging, vlogging, streaming like

134
00:09:15.817 --> 00:09:21.363
this world is so different now, I have
had students get jobs off of vlogging.

135
00:09:21.363 --> 00:09:25.785
Same blog, same people jobs I've
seen vlogs I've seen tweets.

136
00:09:25.785 --> 00:09:30.714
There's no wrong way than doing this
when you're building out a public,

137
00:09:30.714 --> 00:09:34.941
I've seen projects,
I've seen products, I've seen list.

138
00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:39.328
This world is crazy,
put anything that is getting traction and

139
00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:41.905
puts sets you apart from everybody.

140
00:09:41.905 --> 00:09:46.799
This is where you start building your
personality and your highlight reel on

141
00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:51.704
a second page, first page is all,
we have this talk about sizzle and steak.

142
00:09:51.704 --> 00:09:56.692
You do it in reverse where the first page
is all the steak where you're also your

143
00:09:56.692 --> 00:10:01.314
making a strong case database,
analytical case, right there for ATS.

144
00:10:01.314 --> 00:10:05.416
But then as you get further down, you're
able to start sharing more personality and

145
00:10:05.416 --> 00:10:06.933
put more sizzle on it, right?

146
00:10:06.933 --> 00:10:10.326
So it would be,
if you were to do something Suvi, right?

147
00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:15.689
You'll click it, Suvi, and then you would
sizzle, you'll see it later, type deal.

148
00:10:15.689 --> 00:10:19.019
So I guess a resume should be
more like a Suvi steak then.
