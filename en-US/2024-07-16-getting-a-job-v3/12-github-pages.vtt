00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.512
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: For those of you
who don't know what GitHub Pages is,

2
00:00:03.512 --> 00:00:06.680
it is also a special repository for
GitHub.

3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.183
What you do to build your GitHub Page,

4
00:00:11.183 --> 00:00:19.900
is you create a repository that
says your username.github.io.

5
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.394
That is how you create
the repository that populates this.

6
00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:28.867
Now, for
those who have never been exposed to it,

7
00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:33.426
what it does is it populates and
builds an entire website for you.

8
00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:38.643
You could do plain HTML,
CSS JavaScript, or you can use Jekyll

9
00:00:38.643 --> 00:00:44.659
as a build tool if you wanna use it for
blogging and things of that nature.

10
00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.780
In my github.io, in my GitHub Pages
page I have everything that I want to,

11
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.764
like the sections that I have,
my deployment and

12
00:00:54.764 --> 00:00:57.497
how I use it, where to navigate.

13
00:00:57.497 --> 00:01:03.707
How to contact me, either via Twitter or
on LinkedIn, preferably LinkedIn,

14
00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:08.987
and I have the link right here to
go into my portfolio based on this.

15
00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:12.477
Now, I still follow rules,
some rules that I follow.

16
00:01:12.477 --> 00:01:15.485
I believe in white space,
had a profile pic,

17
00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:18.347
I chose a nice color, I prefer color blue.

18
00:01:18.347 --> 00:01:23.531
I added an API,
I literally pick the easiest API to add,

19
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:26.520
and that is the weather app API.

20
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.997
Let people know what's the weather
in my hometown, right?

21
00:01:28.997 --> 00:01:33.439
Like that, I didn't code that,
that's just an API usage, right?

22
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.086
So now when you're sitting here,
like, he did that?

23
00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:42.610
Let me go into his code, script.js, and

24
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.757
see how his code is looking to do that.

25
00:01:46.757 --> 00:01:50.480
Now we have that answer, and
we can go forward like, all right, so

26
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.922
he did actually code that.

27
00:01:51.922 --> 00:01:55.967
And that's how I do things, right?

28
00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:57.427
Now I have my story.

29
00:01:57.427 --> 00:02:03.637
Now, one thing that I wouldn't
recommend on a portfolio for

30
00:02:03.637 --> 00:02:09.743
a user is, if you're in a job market,
having so much text.

31
00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:15.556
I have that story that people usually go
to my websites and things that nature for

32
00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:20.759
the marketability of like,
I wanna learn more about bits of code,

33
00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:24.601
versus I wanna see you're a good employee,
right?

34
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:27.771
They go to my LinkedIn and
GitHub for that, right?

35
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:31.031
So, seeing this,
this is sort of my journey.

36
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:34.271
And I have my work, right?

37
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:38.944
Now, this is where I did
something that I thought was cool.

38
00:02:38.944 --> 00:02:44.020
And I instead of adding a bunch of
pages as all this stuff was live,

39
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.002
I just added cards and used icons.

40
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:50.457
And they linked to things, as you see,

41
00:02:50.457 --> 00:02:55.600
that pops up at the bottom that
are alive out here, right?

42
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.717
So people can now see,

43
00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:03.251
there's a lot of live content out
there for Jerome, for his work.

44
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.945
Now, if I was to continue
to build up on this,

45
00:03:06.945 --> 00:03:11.341
I would add user pages, or
things like that to these.

46
00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.171
So I have user stories,
case studies for each one.

47
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:17.231
Although there'd be some weird
case studies for this, okay.

48
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:22.847
How does the Business Insider
developers story have a case study?

49
00:03:22.847 --> 00:03:27.232
They just wrote an article on me and
included me in it, that's it, right?

50
00:03:27.232 --> 00:03:31.784
So one thing that you can do for pages,
so a lot of people don't tell you,

51
00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:35.112
this is one thing that I
push on my students now.

52
00:03:35.112 --> 00:03:39.190
And that is, now that you have your
colors, your theme for your design doc,

53
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.634
start theming your other projects,
so that way it's easier for

54
00:03:42.634 --> 00:03:45.463
you to build them and
you can turn them like this one.

55
00:03:45.463 --> 00:03:49.467
Like I said, this is a project, I was
like, no, the branch isn't protected.

56
00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:52.447
All the rules that I would do are broken,
right?

57
00:03:52.447 --> 00:03:55.887
This is the project that has
a very funny story to it.

58
00:03:55.887 --> 00:03:59.416
My kid, I literally picked this
project out of the woodwork.

59
00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:04.389
I just came from the flu, 2018,
I had the flu and I had to get up,

60
00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:09.121
help my kid with a school project,
he told us at the last minute.

61
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:11.172
So he had to do the research and

62
00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:16.517
I ended up having to have code it out
because he didn't know what he was doing.

63
00:04:16.517 --> 00:04:20.049
And I didn't wanna go to the store for
a poster board talking about Nashville,

64
00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:20.805
where we lived.

65
00:04:20.805 --> 00:04:22.659
So we coded this up and

66
00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:28.747
I didn't know that you could do this
until I learned this by accident.

67
00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:33.719
You can go into your Settings and
you go to Pages, and

68
00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:39.449
you can deploy any repo on
GitHub now directly into Pages.

69
00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.394
That's one thing that my troops
are now doing, they're now going into

70
00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:47.237
the projects, into the repos,
and they are now making it live.

71
00:04:47.237 --> 00:04:51.472
If I was to go, let's do this real quick,

72
00:04:51.472 --> 00:04:55.228
I could just make a new repo, right?

73
00:04:55.228 --> 00:05:01.193
New repo, hello-world.

74
00:05:01.193 --> 00:05:04.971
Just like I said, boom, choose owner.

75
00:05:09.602 --> 00:05:10.578
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Testing.

76
00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:14.579
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Create a public repo.

77
00:05:18.155 --> 00:05:20.527
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Don't
do any of this stuff.

78
00:05:20.527 --> 00:05:24.547
I'm just going to,
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Go

79
00:05:24.547 --> 00:05:27.710
straight into Create a codespace.

80
00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:39.222
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Remy's there,
so that's cool.

81
00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:46.559
Now I'm right here,
I can be just, right, perfect.

82
00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:47.440
Touch.

83
00:05:50.828 --> 00:05:52.694
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Index.html.

84
00:05:57.652 --> 00:05:59.461
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Ls, right here.

85
00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:03.362
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Now here.

86
00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:15.189
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Html:5, bam,

87
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.027
hello-world.

88
00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:21.295
Gotta love Emmett, right?

89
00:06:24.743 --> 00:06:28.234
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Commit it up,
all right.

90
00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.667
&gt;&gt; Student 1: I think you gotta
put a commit message on line one.

91
00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:41.528
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Update,
thank you, man.

92
00:06:41.528 --> 00:06:43.199
&gt;&gt; Student 1: I don't know
if you [INAUDIBLE] that.

93
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.025
You can then close, maybe.

94
00:06:45.025 --> 00:06:46.232
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yeah, well.

95
00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:51.458
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Okay, go over that.

96
00:06:54.803 --> 00:06:59.887
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yes, but
now we're gonna go here and

97
00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:02.680
find that repo now.

98
00:07:05.888 --> 00:07:09.162
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: 91 repositories,
hello-world.

99
00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:16.819
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Index.html
is in there, Settings,

100
00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:23.265
Pages, GitHub Pages, Branch, Main, Save.

101
00:07:23.265 --> 00:07:26.796
All right, now let's see what happens.

102
00:07:26.796 --> 00:07:29.080
It is still pending.

103
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.100
So, it's gonna take some
time to build it out.

104
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.419
Once it comes back,
we will definitely show it.

105
00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:34.003
Yes, sir?

106
00:07:34.003 --> 00:07:38.370
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Is there a benefit
to doing this GitHub Page

107
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:42.386
approach versus hosting it yourself?

108
00:07:42.386 --> 00:07:47.309
And would you ever have both for
whatever reason?

109
00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:52.642
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I like this approach
when it comes to making it a more modular

110
00:07:52.642 --> 00:07:57.489
style of doing my code, or
if I have a project that I'm planning out.

111
00:07:57.489 --> 00:08:01.934
For instance, let's say I'm
doing a project on patterns and

112
00:08:01.934 --> 00:08:07.335
I wanna make the patterns a different
project or a different repo.

113
00:08:07.335 --> 00:08:12.248
But I have the theme, I add that to my
repo, I go and have those patterns in

114
00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:16.938
there, and I just have each pattern
out as a different repo, right?

115
00:08:16.938 --> 00:08:20.550
If I'm spacing out my work,
this is one process I would do.

116
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.290
Or if I have a fully fledged project that
I wanna have live that has absolutely

117
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:27.457
nothing to do with the code base,
and I wanna just save it there.

118
00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:32.577
Let's say I have a Gatsby app,
that's totally different, right?

119
00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:37.752
Like the Eric app is totally different
from this, I don't know why.

120
00:08:37.752 --> 00:08:40.787
Yeah, right here,
it's totally different than this stuff.

121
00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:46.182
So let's say I wanna do my own URL,
I have a different project, the same URL,

122
00:08:46.182 --> 00:08:50.592
and I just have with this URL and
I just mask it with another URL.

123
00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:57.114
And have GitHub be my hosting company for
it on my hosting site.

124
00:08:57.114 --> 00:09:00.552
So that's one way I like to use
a GitHub Pages as the hosting,

125
00:09:00.552 --> 00:09:04.403
especially on the frontend,
as primary hosting tool.

126
00:09:04.403 --> 00:09:11.117
You might not, that's fine, but I
definitely recommend you use it that way.

127
00:09:11.117 --> 00:09:13.573
I use Vercel on everything now.

128
00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:20.657
I used to use Gatsby and
Netlify a lot, but now I use Gatsby.

129
00:09:20.657 --> 00:09:23.147
Now it's just all Vercel for
most of my work.

130
00:09:23.147 --> 00:09:28.123
But when it comes to my portfolio stuff,
I try to keep everything as contained on

131
00:09:28.123 --> 00:09:31.852
GitHub as possible,
even showcasing this work like this.

132
00:09:31.852 --> 00:09:36.414
So that's a great opportunity to
have a repo that has absolutely

133
00:09:36.414 --> 00:09:39.319
nothing to do with your portfolio.

134
00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:43.569
And host it using GitHub Pages and
then turn around and having and

135
00:09:43.569 --> 00:09:48.224
showcasing that work without having
to spin up another hosting site.

136
00:09:48.224 --> 00:09:50.434
It's like spinning up a different
environment on GitHub.

137
00:09:50.434 --> 00:09:53.309
&gt;&gt; Student 2: You can have
a data-driven application.

138
00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:55.259
You can connect to an API from here,
can't you?

139
00:09:55.259 --> 00:09:55.848
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Yes, you can.

140
00:09:55.848 --> 00:10:00.576
I have an API like this right here,

141
00:10:00.576 --> 00:10:04.010
it's being done by API.

142
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.503
I don't know the weather back home,
I have no idea.

143
00:10:06.503 --> 00:10:07.706
I definitely don't know Celsius.

144
00:10:07.706 --> 00:10:11.095
[LAUGH] I'm an American,
I have no idea what Celsius is.

145
00:10:11.095 --> 00:10:15.702
So all that's being pulled
directly from the API, and

146
00:10:15.702 --> 00:10:19.671
it's coming from the JavaScript and
API key.

147
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:23.714
So that's one of the things that
you have especially doing frontend,

148
00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:25.642
I always recommend using an API.

149
00:10:25.642 --> 00:10:30.209
And Open Weather API is one of
the easiest, lowest hanging fruit APIs,

150
00:10:30.209 --> 00:10:32.583
again, have and throw on a project.

151
00:10:32.583 --> 00:10:36.691
So, hey, I'll just take this tiny API,
put it right here using the frontend.
