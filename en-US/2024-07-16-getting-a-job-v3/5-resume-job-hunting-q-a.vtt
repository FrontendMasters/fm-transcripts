00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.606
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Is this resume
tailored to just USA or

2
00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:06.090
do you think it would
work just kinda anywhere?

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.079
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I have tailored it to
USA, but I will make it international.

4
00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:15.533
I know the UK does a lot more, has
a different style from the United States,

5
00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.971
and I believe India also has one.

6
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:23.112
It's more they want the education more
upfront than the work experience,

7
00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:28.349
but American market prefers more work
experience up first than education.

8
00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.853
So I can tailor it based upon those other
markets, but the data still stands strong.

9
00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:38.471
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Are there job
boards to apply LinkedIn, etc?

10
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:42.841
Are you gonna cover places where you
can actually submit your resume.

11
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.945
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: All right, so two
places that we've tested this that that we

12
00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:51.138
are getting very good metrics
was indeed.com and LinkedIn.

13
00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:53.752
So we're using LinkedIn.

14
00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:58.417
We literally just had a troop,
we did their resume.

15
00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:02.621
I had them to easily apply and just easily
apply to every job that they saw and

16
00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:06.294
see how many jobs they would take
before they're getting hits and

17
00:01:06.294 --> 00:01:10.335
then on same way on Indeed, all right
play with this resume right here.

18
00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:13.755
And we wanted to see just how good
it is without the extra tailoring.

19
00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:16.918
This person already had a job so
we weren't planning on someone's life,

20
00:01:16.918 --> 00:01:17.793
of course, right.

21
00:01:17.793 --> 00:01:21.384
[LAUGH] that would be cruel.

22
00:01:21.384 --> 00:01:25.465
So a junior already had a job
doing informational work, and

23
00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:29.733
that is the data and resources,
the data that we learn.

24
00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:30.373
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:30.373 --> 00:01:34.453
&gt;&gt; Student 1: A common resume question
about how far back to go in history?

26
00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:39.833
For instance, this person has 14 years
of experience in Network admin, sys

27
00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:45.307
admin before switching to web development,
is that something that you would.

28
00:01:45.307 --> 00:01:47.791
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Which
role do they wanna stay in?

29
00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:48.811
They're trying to stay in software engine.

30
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.430
&gt;&gt; Student 1: You're trying to move to web
development from a network sys admin type?

31
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.822
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Well I don't go
past ten years, that's the simple,

32
00:01:56.822 --> 00:02:01.896
cuz even when going to fintech or
legal or anything like that,

33
00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:06.795
they don't go past 10 years
on their background checks.

34
00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:07.961
So I don't know.

35
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:11.720
&gt;&gt; Student 1: What if the job was
14 years at the same company?

36
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.519
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I would just put
14 years at the one company, 14 years.

37
00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:20.620
But the real problem that we're
having there is how are we

38
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.253
gonna try how to leverage those
skills that you learned a job and

39
00:02:26.253 --> 00:02:32.221
then say how that would help in
your current journey for software.

40
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:37.188
You're moving from hardware to software
we wanna know how that translates and

41
00:02:37.188 --> 00:02:39.832
that's what you have to really focus on.

42
00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:44.452
You have to take down those hard skills,
you have to do a pattern matching

43
00:02:44.452 --> 00:02:49.174
translation of those for the new hard
skills that you're gonna be doing.

44
00:02:51.332 --> 00:02:53.331
&gt;&gt; Student 1: A bit of
a motivation question.

45
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:57.731
If I'm constantly out there applying for
all these roles,

46
00:02:57.731 --> 00:03:02.043
how do I manage energy between
making my projects better or

47
00:03:02.043 --> 00:03:04.865
volunteering or these kinda things?

48
00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.090
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Well,
I know you're not constantly applying.

49
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.365
You are time boxing.

50
00:03:08.365 --> 00:03:13.510
You should be able within 25 minutes,
apply for a few roles a day, right?

51
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.283
But don't apply the whole time you want,
it's like an iceberg.

52
00:03:17.283 --> 00:03:22.688
The majority of your time should be
focused on networking, building long-term

53
00:03:22.688 --> 00:03:28.096
relationships with all networking and
building meaningful projects, right?

54
00:03:28.096 --> 00:03:32.996
We'll go further into this, but
you could use your projects to build your

55
00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:36.250
network that will help
you with your job search.

56
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.690
One of the things that we learned during
our studies for this past year is,

57
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.799
when you're building products and
you're out there on the market.

58
00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.221
The jobs that you'll get recommended for
or the jobs that you'll get hired for

59
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:54.377
probably won't be the jobs
that you apply for, right?

60
00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:57.049
So I'm a living testament of that.

61
00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.459
The jobs I have today,
I did not initially go looking for it.

62
00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.805
I was minding my business on Twitter when
the hiring manager slid into my DMs and

63
00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:10.270
was, hey, I would love for
you to come work with us at Microsoft.

64
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.706
I was like, what?

65
00:04:11.706 --> 00:04:14.227
I don't know about that and
then here I am at Microsoft.

66
00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:19.367
So that is when you're building things,
people notice.

67
00:04:19.367 --> 00:04:23.810
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Assuming you're gonna
cover this a little bit later, but,

68
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.512
tips to deal with ageism or
if you're advanced in your career for

69
00:04:28.512 --> 00:04:33.668
instance, this person online said
she has 27 years at one company.

70
00:04:33.668 --> 00:04:36.336
It was a great job, but
now she's back on the market.

71
00:04:36.336 --> 00:04:39.794
So how do you think about that?

72
00:04:39.794 --> 00:04:41.378
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Well 27 years wow,

73
00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:45.602
I would love another job to
keep you there for 27 years.

74
00:04:45.602 --> 00:04:50.183
But it comes down to being able to
showcase your growth within that

75
00:04:50.183 --> 00:04:54.931
company one if it was a tech job and
two how those skills translate and

76
00:04:54.931 --> 00:04:58.364
how you've been staying
current on the market.

77
00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:03.241
Cuz when you see people are accustomed
to people jumping now every two to

78
00:05:03.241 --> 00:05:04.712
five years, right?

79
00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:08.368
So once you get past that sweet
spot of the five year mark,

80
00:05:08.368 --> 00:05:11.643
people assume that you've
gotten comfortable and

81
00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:16.152
you aren't growing at a the clip
that the external market is, right?

82
00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:23.897
Because of how fast Tech changes at
a job versus how it changes externally.

83
00:05:23.897 --> 00:05:25.924
People are assuming you're not
keeping up with that stuff.

84
00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:29.667
So you have to showcase how you're
keeping up with the modern tools and

85
00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:34.182
technologies externally while working
internally, even if you're not using it.

86
00:05:34.182 --> 00:05:38.184
That's one of the reasons
why we do while we continue,

87
00:05:38.184 --> 00:05:42.099
even when we have jobs to
build projects to showcase,

88
00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:45.935
I am still keeping up with
the kids outside, right?

89
00:05:45.935 --> 00:05:49.866
So that we could definitely that's a very
good use case that we could dive deeper

90
00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:50.403
in later.

91
00:05:50.403 --> 00:05:53.877
&gt;&gt; Student 1: Yeah and then we have
the other end of the spectrum on the chat

92
00:05:53.877 --> 00:05:57.075
where he's saying he has
very little experience, and

93
00:05:57.075 --> 00:06:01.828
it's trying to build that experience to
get coz he's not getting Coldax at all.

94
00:06:01.828 --> 00:06:02.685
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Build products.

95
00:06:02.685 --> 00:06:07.375
The first thing I hear when I see someone
say they're putting their resume out, and

96
00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:12.002
if I see more than 50 applications, the
first thing I'm going to is their code.

97
00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:16.668
And then I'm going to what is live, and
then I'm gonna go and see what is live,

98
00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:19.366
and I'm going to chop that up and
see, okay.

99
00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:20.999
This is what you haven't done.

100
00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:22.785
This is what you need to do.

101
00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:27.549
There are certain things that, I on here,
I call myself, if you look at it, I say

102
00:06:27.549 --> 00:06:31.982
the roles that I am doing on this resume,
but I still use to turn full stack.

103
00:06:31.982 --> 00:06:36.854
I don't say I'm a full stack engineer
because that's a red flag in

104
00:06:36.854 --> 00:06:38.777
all ATS systems, right?

105
00:06:38.777 --> 00:06:42.144
And hiring managers, when they see,
they want you to talk about full stack and

106
00:06:42.144 --> 00:06:44.236
in terms of that,
you've built on a full stack,

107
00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:47.012
but they don't want you to call
yourself a full stack engineer.

108
00:06:47.012 --> 00:06:48.667
I call myself software engineer.

109
00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:49.178
That's what I do.

110
00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:53.288
I build software, but
I've worked on the full stack.

111
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:58.561
I've worked in different components of
a stack that you might not even think of.

112
00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:01.839
I've worked on the product side,
the data side, the DevOps side.

113
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.162
I've done,
I've touched all of those, right?

114
00:07:04.162 --> 00:07:07.370
That makes me a software engineer, right?

115
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.987
But I've worked under
the entirety of that stack.

116
00:07:10.987 --> 00:07:13.648
So it's not just what you say,
it's how you say it.

117
00:07:13.648 --> 00:07:15.130
It could be red flag, right?

118
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.991
Putting, I said, very meticulous, very
wild world we're living out there where I

119
00:07:19.991 --> 00:07:22.456
could have work experience
at Tech Corp and

120
00:07:22.456 --> 00:07:26.583
call myself a senior full-stack
engineer and that would get flagged.

121
00:07:26.583 --> 00:07:30.849
But if I call myself a senior software
engineer, it'll get greenlit, right?

122
00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.438
So that's how the market is.

123
00:07:32.438 --> 00:07:35.989
&gt;&gt; Student 1: How do you handle imposter
syndrome and comparing yourself and

124
00:07:35.989 --> 00:07:38.809
your abilities to
everybody else constantly?.

125
00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:42.207
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: One,
I'll start from second question first.

126
00:07:43.895 --> 00:07:45.273
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Don't
look at scoreboard.

127
00:07:45.273 --> 00:07:49.876
Focus on what you can do and train, right?

128
00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:54.634
I find that I have the most
imposter syndrome on

129
00:07:54.634 --> 00:07:59.398
the things that I train for
the least, right?

130
00:07:59.398 --> 00:08:04.711
If you asked me to go and
build something and go, I would have crazy

131
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:09.849
impostor syndrome,
because I have touched absolutely no go.

132
00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:11.333
I don't know anything about that.

133
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:16.070
But you asked me to do something in
Python, my imposter syndrome would not be

134
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.671
as strong cuz I have three years of
I'm doing that at an enterprise level.

135
00:08:20.671 --> 00:08:23.462
If you ask me something in JavaScript,
I'm of course, yeah, let's do this.

136
00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:28.048
Yeah, I have almost like
a decade of experience, right?

137
00:08:28.048 --> 00:08:33.011
So that is how we do deal
with imposter syndrome

138
00:08:33.011 --> 00:08:37.351
is you keep doing things, practicing.

139
00:08:37.351 --> 00:08:39.872
You keep doing things publicly, right?

140
00:08:39.872 --> 00:08:44.352
You're part of your imposter syndrome is
you're not getting feedback negative or

141
00:08:44.352 --> 00:08:45.443
positive, right?

142
00:08:45.443 --> 00:08:48.783
No one's saying anything good or
bad about your work, so

143
00:08:48.783 --> 00:08:51.787
you're not understanding
where you can improve.

144
00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:54.458
So, and
human beings are naturally negative and

145
00:08:54.458 --> 00:08:56.813
hearing just the bad voices in their head.

146
00:08:56.813 --> 00:09:00.030
So if the only critic you
have in your life is you,

147
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:04.260
you're gonna tell yourself
you're trash all the time.

148
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.512
But if you are getting external feedback
and people are showing you, hey,

149
00:09:08.512 --> 00:09:09.807
you can improve here.

150
00:09:09.807 --> 00:09:13.640
I really like what you did here,
you should do more of that,

151
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.952
that is how you get better, right?

152
00:09:15.952 --> 00:09:19.357
And that external feedback makes you
better than you get more good jobs

153
00:09:19.357 --> 00:09:19.881
than bad.

154
00:09:19.881 --> 00:09:22.666
And now your imposter syndrome is down.

155
00:09:22.666 --> 00:09:27.185
I can really do this cuz somebody actually
liked the thing I built, that's cool.

156
00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:32.456
&gt;&gt; Student 2: So one issue that
exists in general in the job market,

157
00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:37.496
especially with COVID and
schools being closed and

158
00:09:37.496 --> 00:09:43.844
everything is people have these so
called gaps in their resume.

159
00:09:43.844 --> 00:09:47.940
Maybe they have to attend
to having children

160
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:52.809
who aren't in school, or
elderly family members,

161
00:09:52.809 --> 00:09:57.697
and so they have what LinkedIn
calls a career break.

162
00:09:57.697 --> 00:10:05.229
Have you seen if that is a red
flag to employers that flat?

163
00:10:05.229 --> 00:10:09.934
If there's not a continuous line
of time in a resume that the AI

164
00:10:09.934 --> 00:10:12.024
system is gonna drag it up.

165
00:10:12.024 --> 00:10:15.129
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Negative I'm not
seeing that as long as it's placed, right?

166
00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:19.673
Where the AI doesn't red flag like hey,
are you still stopped in this job and

167
00:10:19.673 --> 00:10:23.806
then you started this job just says
your bounty years of experience.

168
00:10:23.806 --> 00:10:26.176
It doesn't pick up the career breaks.

169
00:10:26.176 --> 00:10:30.631
But people on LinkedIn, and
you can say career break and new kid or

170
00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:34.689
taking care of loved ones,
things of that nature, right?
