00:00:00.153 --> 00:00:04.712
&gt;&gt; Student: Any recommendations for
getting a mentor?

2
00:00:04.712 --> 00:00:06.663
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: All right, cool,
I actually have database on this.

3
00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:10.348
First things first,
if you're an aspiring software engineer,

4
00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:13.574
you don't go past two years
of experience for yourself.

5
00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:18.358
Matter of fact, just as a software
engineer, period, you don't go

6
00:00:18.358 --> 00:00:23.390
past two years of whoever you're trying
to find as a mentor because one,

7
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.355
when you go past two years, that
person is focused on learning as well.

8
00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:33.287
So it is either you're pulling them
back to focus on the skill set that

9
00:00:33.287 --> 00:00:37.540
they've already proven to, or
they had to move forward and

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:42.065
try to teach you things that you
might not be ready for, right?

11
00:00:42.065 --> 00:00:44.657
So one of the things
that we do at Vetsu Code,

12
00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:49.213
you have to have a year of production
experience to be a mentor, but you cannot

13
00:00:49.213 --> 00:00:53.656
have more than two years of experience for
an aspiring software engineer.

14
00:00:53.656 --> 00:00:55.025
That's just what we've seen.

15
00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.961
So that's the first step.

16
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.456
I would say when it comes to
finding a mentor or you don't have

17
00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:07.582
something in place for a system to
do that, start with work, right?

18
00:01:07.582 --> 00:01:12.048
Start with asking feedback on your
projects, on your products, and

19
00:01:12.048 --> 00:01:17.053
then as people start giving you feedback,
they kinda start falling into that

20
00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:21.905
mentorship role anyway, especially
in local communities formalities.

21
00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:25.360
I've always found it weird
when people just come up and

22
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.171
asked me to be their mentor.

23
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.642
We don't even know each other.

24
00:01:29.642 --> 00:01:34.772
You wanna build that rapport
first cuz you might not know me,

25
00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:40.417
I tell people that I'm a very hard mentor,
I'm very skill based.

26
00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:43.302
I'm very, I will make you go and
do something again.

27
00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:49.090
I am all in your issues and I'm asking,
I'm adding more issues to your work.

28
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.591
I am like straight up,
I am your worst nightmare as a mentor.

29
00:01:53.591 --> 00:01:55.587
I'm not the type that's like,
hey, good job.

30
00:01:55.587 --> 00:01:59.658
I'm like, hey, no, you got to fix this,
fix that, fix this, fix some more of this.

31
00:01:59.658 --> 00:02:01.174
I am gonna make.

32
00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:05.714
I'm gonna make you have
professional grade work already.

33
00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:10.645
So you have to be like, are you willing
to deal with someone that when you ask

34
00:02:10.645 --> 00:02:14.170
them to review your personal
project piddly thing and

35
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.499
kick it back with five,
six things that they want fixed, right?

36
00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:22.249
No one's even gonna see this, I'm like,
I don't care Here, I saw it, right?

37
00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:27.189
So you have to know that about that person
before you like, hey, be my mentor.

38
00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.793
You have to focus on building those
long-term relationships before you get to

39
00:02:30.793 --> 00:02:32.822
the, hey, will you formally pour into me?

40
00:02:32.822 --> 00:02:34.162
Will we have this meeting time?

41
00:02:34.162 --> 00:02:35.487
Things like that.

42
00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.294
That is like my recommendation.

43
00:02:37.294 --> 00:02:41.251
You also,
you have to be prepared to hear no, right?

44
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:44.496
Cuz some people,
they might not have the bandwidth, but

45
00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:47.603
also, like I said,
if you're doing it the right way,

46
00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:51.131
that mentorship thing kind of
happens organically, right?

47
00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:52.912
And that's what you really
want on mentorship.

48
00:02:52.912 --> 00:02:56.064
You really don't want,
it's not like a knight and

49
00:02:56.064 --> 00:02:59.078
squire thing that people
keep trying to make it.

50
00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:03.031
It's like, I'm not gonna follow me for
seven years and

51
00:03:03.031 --> 00:03:05.815
then one day become a knight yourself.

52
00:03:05.815 --> 00:03:11.493
I'm pouring into you in a or
we're gonna be somewhat systematic but

53
00:03:11.493 --> 00:03:13.994
it's also gonna be organic.

54
00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:18.426
I wanna see you win because seeing
you win means I win as well

55
00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:23.237
because I am emotionally invested
in your victories, right?

56
00:03:23.237 --> 00:03:25.787
That is what you want it to turn into,
right?

57
00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:28.625
You want, hey, I just did this big thing.

58
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.176
You're like, what, really, you did?

59
00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.533
Let me go tell three other
people the thing you did, right?

60
00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:34.694
That you don't even know and
then introduce them to you.

61
00:03:34.694 --> 00:03:36.970
That's how you want your
mentorship to turn into, right?

62
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.911
You don't even want, you want to get to
the point where you're not even asking.

63
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.217
You're just, stuff is just happening.

64
00:03:41.217 --> 00:03:41.884
Happening for you.

65
00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:42.494
All right?

66
00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:45.784
And that's why you wanna do
it in an organic, showing,

67
00:03:45.784 --> 00:03:49.426
you wanna add value to
the relationship type way, all right?

68
00:03:49.426 --> 00:03:54.139
So, I guess that's a long way of me
answering that question of how to find

69
00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.177
a mentor, I don't believe it's a one size,
meets fits all.

70
00:03:58.177 --> 00:04:02.978
But I do think, that when you start
with the things you build, and

71
00:04:02.978 --> 00:04:06.224
then you go from there,
it makes it easier.
