00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So,
networking strategy and in current market.

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.455
What I have seen, particularly
the junior side is people are just,

3
00:00:05.455 --> 00:00:08.320
I had it happen to me twice
today during this workshop.

4
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.830
They are saying hello, they're pitching
themselves, hire me or give me a referral.

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.254
And that's all in the same conversation.

6
00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:22.464
I don't know who you are,
I have no idea how we met,

7
00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:27.396
I don't know how you got this email,
I have no information about you other than

8
00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:31.164
the information you've given me and
what you told me to do.

9
00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.954
That is not networking.

10
00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:36.894
That is [LAUGH] stalking and pitching.

11
00:00:36.894 --> 00:00:40.573
[LAUGH] That is what you do not wanna
do because now you've just ended up

12
00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:41.715
on my block list, and

13
00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:45.530
then I'm gonna tell this with the world
about you on Frontend Masters.

14
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.150
You don't wanna do that, right?

15
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.750
So how you do this, right?

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.478
First we have to acknowledge
the facts about the focus of network.

17
00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:56.138
You have to shift your focus.

18
00:00:56.138 --> 00:01:00.511
Networking is not an end game,
it's a long game.

19
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:05.952
It's about consistently showcasing and
sharing your value mutually

20
00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:11.402
with your community and the people
that you are working with, right?

21
00:01:11.402 --> 00:01:15.069
Junior Developers, for
those on the ones and twos.

22
00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:22.244
Your job as a junior developer
Is to showcase hard skill value.

23
00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:27.860
So your focus when you're trying to
network is you should be getting

24
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.194
a feedback loop centered on your
projects or products, right?

25
00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:36.121
That works for juniors, that works for
mids, some of the seniors, everyone.

26
00:01:36.121 --> 00:01:41.585
I have one of my favorite people all
he's director of engineering at Hilton.

27
00:01:41.585 --> 00:01:45.782
He built a Chrome plugin for dyslexia.

28
00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:50.303
And while he was laid off and
he ended up getting more job

29
00:01:50.303 --> 00:01:54.245
hires off of that than
just than anything else.

30
00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:56.901
And you think about this is
a pretty senior person, but

31
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:59.917
he solved a problem that was
important to people, all right?

32
00:01:59.917 --> 00:02:01.707
So that's what you want.

33
00:02:01.707 --> 00:02:05.530
You wanna build a product, build
a project, get feedback, even if it's in

34
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.843
the discussions and things, and
then you wanna iterate on that.

35
00:02:08.843 --> 00:02:14.131
Now, when troops, the best story I
have for that is James Regan, who,

36
00:02:14.131 --> 00:02:19.859
he would come to me, ask for my advice
in LinkedIn, I'd give him my advice and

37
00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.739
then he would do it, and
then he'd be like, ask for more advice.

38
00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.867
And I was like, okay, this person
has built a rapport of trust of,

39
00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:34.446
hey, you are actually going to
do the thing I tell you to do,

40
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:39.600
which makes me not feel like I'm
wasting my time with you, right?

41
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.152
So yes, I will mentor you even though my
plate is full even though I have four

42
00:02:44.152 --> 00:02:49.091
kids, three dogs and a wife, even though I
have a job and I have a bunch of troops.

43
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:53.506
Yes, I will also talk and mentor you
because you're showcasing me that you

44
00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:58.501
value my time and my expertise and you're
gonna execute, I'm one of those people.

45
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.151
I love people that execute, right?

46
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:05.291
I'm probably not the only person that
likes a person that if I tell them to do

47
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.011
something, they go and do it.

48
00:03:07.011 --> 00:03:09.141
And I'm like, all right,
what else you got, right?

49
00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:10.656
People love that.

50
00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:12.278
Wow, you did what I said.

51
00:03:12.278 --> 00:03:16.576
And you actually did what I said instead
of just wasted 20 minutes of my life?

52
00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:17.338
That's awesome.

53
00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:22.351
Of course, I'm gonna have more time with
you, especially in this modern age, you'll

54
00:03:22.351 --> 00:03:27.026
be amazed how many people wanna pick your
brain, but they don't wanna do the thing

55
00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:32.072
that they wanna do because, networking,
getting this job in tech it's work, right?

56
00:03:32.072 --> 00:03:34.397
It looks a lot like work and

57
00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:40.021
not just being able to just smooth
your way into roles, right?

58
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:43.826
So, this is what you
should do as a junior.

59
00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:47.608
You should be building a feedback loop
based on your projects, build and

60
00:03:47.608 --> 00:03:51.762
showcase those projects, receive feedback,
iterate based on the feedback,

61
00:03:51.762 --> 00:03:55.992
keep people updated, even if it's just
live on LinkedIn, so people can see it.

62
00:03:55.992 --> 00:03:59.409
And then always,
you can make it even more personal.

63
00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.832
If I'm on LinkedIn, I get feedback
from somebody like this person.

64
00:04:02.832 --> 00:04:07.390
I was like, that person,
gave me feedback on how to improve this.

65
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.720
And he gave me these changes and
then I implemented them.

66
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.403
I wanna thank you for
spending your time and do this, right?

67
00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:17.141
People love gratitude, right?

68
00:04:17.141 --> 00:04:18.211
Everybody loves being thanked.

69
00:04:18.211 --> 00:04:21.932
I have yet to meet one person that's like,
no, don't thank me, right?

70
00:04:21.932 --> 00:04:25.472
Veterans, they say that, but
we all actually do like being thanked for

71
00:04:25.472 --> 00:04:26.182
our service.

72
00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:29.879
It's just the right thing to say is
don't thank me for my service I work for

73
00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.142
a living, I volunteer.

74
00:04:31.142 --> 00:04:36.184
But we're all like, yes, somebody
recognize that crap was crazy, right?

75
00:04:36.184 --> 00:04:42.246
So [LAUGH] all right, don't let us lie
to you all on the news, but keep it up.
