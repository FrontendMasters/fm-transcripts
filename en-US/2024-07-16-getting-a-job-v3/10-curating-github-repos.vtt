00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: We're
going to move straight into

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.035
Strategic Repository Pinning.

3
00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:10.504
So the importance of repository pinning
for the job search is pretty simple.

4
00:00:10.504 --> 00:00:16.169
You want to put the projects that
showcase your strengths first,

5
00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.544
and you wanna make it easy.

6
00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:22.645
The whole point of the job search is for
you to make it easy for

7
00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:24.626
you to be the top candidate.

8
00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:28.595
I think that's how people don't
really think about the job search.

9
00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.260
You're not trying to get a job,

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.621
you're trying to be the obvious choice for
the job.

11
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:37.042
You wanna be the top candidate.

12
00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:40.108
You wanna be the person
with the top potential.

13
00:00:40.108 --> 00:00:43.254
That's what you want.

14
00:00:43.254 --> 00:00:46.713
I call it front-loading, where I put so

15
00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:50.885
much information out there
in front of the user,

16
00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:55.567
which is the hiring manager and
the technical people,

17
00:00:55.567 --> 00:01:00.793
that everything else kinda feels
like a formality for them.

18
00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:01.693
That's what I want.

19
00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:06.489
I want that feeling from them
that I'm already on the team.

20
00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:07.541
That's my job.

21
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:09.569
So I treat it like I'm in,

22
00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:15.307
I've already going through the interview
process before them, right?

23
00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:20.502
So for jobs that I want,
I'm putting the repositories and

24
00:01:20.502 --> 00:01:27.295
things of that nature up there that
it's already gonna help me win, right?

25
00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:32.350
So versus, remember that key projects,
right-handed profile.

26
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.670
But my pin projects, I have similar
projects that are just there.

27
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.486
There's also my key projects and
I'm showcasing,

28
00:01:40.486 --> 00:01:45.093
it gives a little high level
overview with these pins, right?

29
00:01:45.093 --> 00:01:47.642
They see what's the primary
language in there, right?

30
00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:52.050
So they know this one's TypeScript,
this one was in my last course,

31
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.012
things of that nature, and
how many stars they have, right?

32
00:01:56.012 --> 00:02:00.743
So they're able to go into and
start looking into these projects.

33
00:02:00.743 --> 00:02:05.647
Now, this one, when you type into it,
you see that I've been working on it,

34
00:02:05.647 --> 00:02:07.844
everybody's been working on it.

35
00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:09.131
How many contributors?

36
00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.470
This is the one that I have
my troops contribute to,

37
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.731
and I have that ReadMe filled out.

38
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:19.989
I have the badges of what it is,
which NPM, which version of.

39
00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.326
Noted is license, contributions,
welcome, what is powered by Vercel.

40
00:02:26.326 --> 00:02:32.245
I have what it is,
the ReadMe is nice and clear.

41
00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:37.411
Every ReadMe on my pinning repositories
is gonna be nice and clear.

42
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:41.100
And have showcased how to run it and
what's the purpose for it.

43
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.849
I'm never gonna have ugly ReadMe on
any project that I'm gonna showcase.

44
00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.514
That is a no-no for
me cuz it's all down here from there.

45
00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:57.174
There's a great book on design
called Don't Make Me Think,

46
00:02:57.174 --> 00:03:01.493
that you should take that type of
approach with everything that you do.

47
00:03:01.493 --> 00:03:06.265
My job is not to make the person that I
wanna make money with think about if I'm

48
00:03:06.265 --> 00:03:07.392
a good designer.

49
00:03:07.392 --> 00:03:11.086
Yeah, of course, it's a easy decision.

50
00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:12.381
Yes, pay the guy.

51
00:03:12.381 --> 00:03:13.977
That's what you want, right?

52
00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:16.520
So that's what I'm doing.

53
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.108
I show them what's under the hood,
talking about the architecture,

54
00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:24.384
say about what my mission is,
how to get started.

55
00:03:24.384 --> 00:03:28.951
The prerequisites of how to run this
application, how to get up and running,

56
00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:32.337
how to start within,
how to use dev container or Docker.

57
00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:37.457
Now, that was one thing that I have
learned over the course of the past

58
00:03:37.457 --> 00:03:43.193
year is, a superpower people, they love
that opportunity to be able to go and

59
00:03:43.193 --> 00:03:48.051
use Docker and dev container and
not have to download all the other

60
00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:53.116
things that you have in your repo,
put it on their machine locally.

61
00:03:53.116 --> 00:03:56.766
So when they download the repo and
then they clone your repo and

62
00:03:56.766 --> 00:03:59.641
it's like, and their VS Code, the whole,

63
00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:04.364
if you wanna run it with Docker shows up,
they're like, wow that's awesome.

64
00:04:04.364 --> 00:04:08.095
So containerizing your apps,
that is something I definitely recommend.

65
00:04:08.095 --> 00:04:12.523
It makes it friendly and they, like I
said, they absolutely, especially for

66
00:04:12.523 --> 00:04:15.759
juniors, they love seeing
that you thought about that.

67
00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:22.199
That showcases you're behind thinking
about the user experience on DevOps and

68
00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.573
a more infrastructure thought process.

69
00:04:25.573 --> 00:04:27.871
So they eat that up.

70
00:04:29.992 --> 00:04:31.226
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: But I have that.

71
00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:35.166
Showcase, once again, showcase some steps
where to open, have my contribution,

72
00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:39.453
guidelines, roadmap, license, they see all
these things of how I'm thinking, right?

73
00:04:39.453 --> 00:04:41.088
Have this license, I have this roadmap.

74
00:04:41.088 --> 00:04:45.740
I've how to contribute,
I have all these things in place so

75
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.591
that the user that show showcases,
okay, this is a project.

76
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:55.490
This is something that he doesn't do for
his day job, but this is pretty robust for

77
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.330
a project that someone
doesn't do on a day job.

78
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.087
Then when I talk about it and
you're like, I bring up the metrics and

79
00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:07.259
the numbers and I bring up how
many people hit the website and

80
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:10.699
how many views,
things hit in all my analytics.

81
00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:14.686
I've took a playbook of page out
the Frontend Masters book of using

82
00:05:14.686 --> 00:05:19.170
the transformations from my images to
see how many times people are hitting

83
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.317
the website and things like that, based
upon the transformation, stuff like that.

84
00:05:24.317 --> 00:05:28.195
Because markets, and
is very big against Google Analytics.

85
00:05:28.195 --> 00:05:32.771
So I was like, okay,
that's a cool idea, go from there.

86
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:36.653
So that's another thing you can always
learn from people you talk to, right?

87
00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:41.597
And of course, I wanna make sure you
look at these technologies right now

88
00:05:41.597 --> 00:05:45.341
as a software engineer
that's focusing on frontend.

89
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:50.489
These right now are the most community
popular technologies that are stable,

90
00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:51.036
right?

91
00:05:51.036 --> 00:05:55.842
Those top three, Next.js,
Tailwind, Playwright,

92
00:05:55.842 --> 00:06:01.377
those are things that are getting
more popular in the industry.

93
00:06:01.377 --> 00:06:06.099
That are, if you know,
people are gonna assume that you know

94
00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.744
other things as well,
that you're adept in other things.

95
00:06:10.744 --> 00:06:15.556
It's like, that's why they say yes.

96
00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:19.699
It's like how when Angular first hit,
people assume that you knew React,

97
00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:23.449
the library, because you understood
Angular, the framework, or

98
00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.646
that you could understand it, right?

99
00:06:25.646 --> 00:06:30.710
Being able to work with
something as robust as Next.js,

100
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.194
I understand that you're focusing
on these tools that are for

101
00:06:36.194 --> 00:06:39.161
productivity and E to E, right?

102
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:42.556
Playwright is the ED testing suite.

103
00:06:42.556 --> 00:06:47.404
When they see that, they're like,
that showcases that's a code,

104
00:06:47.404 --> 00:06:50.307
that's an indicator, a signal to people.

105
00:06:50.307 --> 00:06:53.895
They're like, hey,
I am preparing, or I am ready for

106
00:06:53.895 --> 00:06:56.867
more mature products and projects, right?

107
00:06:56.867 --> 00:07:00.504
That is how the user sees that, right?

108
00:07:00.504 --> 00:07:03.560
That's how developers see that
when they see technology.

109
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.350
You have to think that developers
are very communal, right?

110
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.054
So if you're in a community and, for
instance, in the Java community and

111
00:07:12.054 --> 00:07:15.760
someone sees these things,
they see Tailwind, they see Next.js, they

112
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.215
see Playwright, they're gonna assume that
you're accustomed to more modern stack.

113
00:07:20.215 --> 00:07:25.042
You are focusing on things
that the community is

114
00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:29.755
working on or
is on fire about as well, right?

115
00:07:29.755 --> 00:07:33.480
And of course, TypeScript,
I'm not gonna lie,

116
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.038
I was a big outlier about
learning TypeScript.

117
00:07:37.038 --> 00:07:41.637
But the harsh reality is that if you're
gonna do React on any app that's

118
00:07:41.637 --> 00:07:44.854
making money out there,
a lot of times out of ten,

119
00:07:44.854 --> 00:07:50.091
I'm gonna use some TypeScript on the
frontend, or Angular in this TypeScript.

120
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:55.076
I think people who use view now
also use some TypeScript, but

121
00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:59.008
I know Angular and
React is on enterprise side.

122
00:07:59.008 --> 00:08:00.148
You're definitely using TypeScript.

123
00:08:00.148 --> 00:08:03.365
So if you learn JavaScript,
the minute you move into a framework,

124
00:08:03.365 --> 00:08:04.863
you have to learn TypeScript.

125
00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:08.605
That's just, if you wanna make money,
gotta learn TypeScript.

126
00:08:08.605 --> 00:08:12.955
If you wanna get a job as a frontend
developer, and not know TypeScript,

127
00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:15.395
you're gonna have a very hard journey.

128
00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:16.664
You need to go ahead.

129
00:08:16.664 --> 00:08:18.986
That's a mandatory skill now.

130
00:08:18.986 --> 00:08:24.466
It went from a nice to have in 2017
to a fundamental skill now in 2024.

131
00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:28.653
Going back to here,
I keep my contributions bar open so

132
00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:34.570
people see how much I can contribute,
as well as what I've contributed to and

133
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.683
all the repos that I'm going over and
under, right?

134
00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:43.084
So this builds a story of sorts, right?

135
00:08:43.084 --> 00:08:46.068
With a pinning rep repositories,
they can go into, they can go and

136
00:08:46.068 --> 00:08:47.147
look into more things.

137
00:08:47.147 --> 00:08:50.289
When they see, this one has a,
cuz that's exactly what they're gonna do.

138
00:08:50.289 --> 00:08:54.720
They're gonna go and look at a thing that
has 111 stars and see what that's about.

139
00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.038
Or they're gonna go and
see this thing and they're be like, okay,

140
00:08:57.038 --> 00:08:58.432
this has TypeScript, it has code on it.

141
00:08:58.432 --> 00:08:59.722
What is this about?

142
00:08:59.722 --> 00:09:06.304
And then that is how, the story, that's
how I can control the flow of my story.

143
00:09:06.304 --> 00:09:11.323
My story is controlling the flow of
the legitimacy of the work I do.

144
00:09:11.323 --> 00:09:15.146
So I wanna showcase, hey, these
are the things I've built for veterans.

145
00:09:15.146 --> 00:09:16.774
This is what we're doing
on a virtual code.

146
00:09:16.774 --> 00:09:21.620
Come over here, see this code, see this
coursework, see the things we're building.

147
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.012
Go here for you and be like, hey,
here's the tools and toys and

148
00:09:25.012 --> 00:09:29.498
language I'm building, here's the products
that I have pushed out into the web.

149
00:09:29.498 --> 00:09:33.326
Here are the people that are using it,
here's how I'm using it, and

150
00:09:33.326 --> 00:09:35.903
you should definitely
go check out this code.
