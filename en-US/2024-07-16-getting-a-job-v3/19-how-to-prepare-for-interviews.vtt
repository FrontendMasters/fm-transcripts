00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:02.719
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I usually
don't include this section,

2
00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:07.687
especially the last three years, because
frankly, if you did everything else

3
00:00:07.687 --> 00:00:12.232
I told you the right way, you usually
wouldn't even need this section.

4
00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:17.195
But the market has changed
where even people like me,

5
00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:22.600
who have crazy career metrics
of being all over the place,

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.585
are still having to do the code challenge.

7
00:00:26.585 --> 00:00:30.757
Where they're not valuing
just the work you've done.

8
00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:34.569
So we have to now talk about this
technical interview preparation.

9
00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:39.323
How to do it,
how do we plan it out when it

10
00:00:39.323 --> 00:00:43.660
comes to a particular job, right?

11
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.651
And now I'm going to go over stuff
that not only the statistical

12
00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:52.888
data show that it's a code,
but the data has shown for

13
00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:56.579
me this year with my own
journey of what works.

14
00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.699
First step, you have to
understand the interview process.

15
00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.938
So we know, you got the resume with ATS,

16
00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:08.550
ATS said good HR, and
now we go from the HR and

17
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.572
we are able to like, okay,
you're going to interview.

18
00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:15.945
So, how's that interview go?

19
00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.897
Your HR calls you,
in today's market HR is going to call you,

20
00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:21.725
it's going to be recorded.

21
00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:25.245
They are going to be using artificial
intelligence on this recording.

22
00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:30.580
So this is why you need to practice
every single layer of interviewing.

23
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.611
They are gonna be doing sentiment
analysis on this recording,

24
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:39.470
I can't stress that enough.

25
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.756
There will be sentiment analysis
done on this recording,

26
00:01:42.756 --> 00:01:44.642
that's what the software does.

27
00:01:44.642 --> 00:01:49.262
It showcases if you're based upon your
uhs, how uncertain the inflections in your

28
00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:53.297
voice, things like that, this is what
this software is designed to do.

29
00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:59.949
So that first phone call you have,
that is your life right there.

30
00:01:59.949 --> 00:02:04.962
That's not, you can't just
foodbar your way through that.

31
00:02:04.962 --> 00:02:06.097
This is life.

32
00:02:06.097 --> 00:02:13.035
So after that, if you pass that, usually,
in order to keep from bias happening,

33
00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:17.272
the first interview is
gonna be a co-challenge.

34
00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:21.499
That is what happens, so that way you
cannot use rapport and relationships.

35
00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.863
It's gonna be a code challenge, and
because of the way the technology is now,

36
00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:29.052
it's gonna be on CodeSignal,
HackerRank, LeetCode.

37
00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:33.772
Even though, as a programmer that's
worked in enterprise tech now,

38
00:02:33.772 --> 00:02:38.012
I have yet to see a problem that
translates well from LeetCode or

39
00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:40.497
HackerRank into real world coding.

40
00:02:40.497 --> 00:02:43.144
That is still gonna be the thing.

41
00:02:43.144 --> 00:02:48.424
Now, we're saying this,
why is this gonna be in these,

42
00:02:48.424 --> 00:02:54.144
is because with IDEs, with AI,
Audi, stools, co-pilot,

43
00:02:54.144 --> 00:02:59.212
it's like back in 2015
when rails was really big.

44
00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:04.402
People can build robust tools and
robust applications

45
00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:10.059
with minimal processing,
a minimal experience, right?

46
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:14.422
So it's the same thing with now in the era
of AI, I can give you a code challenge,

47
00:03:14.422 --> 00:03:17.941
but if I, one, didn't already
care about the code challenge,

48
00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:19.986
just pull someone off the internet.

49
00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:25.468
Definitely ChatGPT definitely knows that,
or Copilot knows it, etc.

50
00:03:25.468 --> 00:03:29.102
So now I have to put you in these
environments that aren't realistic,

51
00:03:29.102 --> 00:03:32.674
they don't have linters,
they don't have access to the internet,

52
00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:36.140
things of that nature, in order for
you to actually code, right?

53
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.056
To see if you can truly code.

54
00:03:39.056 --> 00:03:43.199
I've had two of them, one,
it was much more difficult, and

55
00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:47.277
then the other one it was much
easier with the type of tools.

56
00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:50.665
So I was like, so some of them
are going higher in skill set, and

57
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:54.477
some of them are going lower in skill
set based upon the fact that guess what?

58
00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:57.125
The nature of how you
code in real life is, so

59
00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.924
far different from nature
to encode on these.

60
00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:06.134
But you still have to prepare for the
higher levels, that's what I recommend.

61
00:04:06.134 --> 00:04:10.999
So, now you do that, then you get your
loops or your other versions of like,

62
00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.368
now you're talking to the dev team.

63
00:04:13.368 --> 00:04:15.579
You're talking to one, two, three,

64
00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.813
there are sometimes flying you out to
talk to people on the developer team.

65
00:04:19.813 --> 00:04:23.999
So that way you're now having
to ask these questions, IRL,

66
00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:26.308
but there's also bias in stuff.

67
00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:31.248
Cuz once the developers get in or they
start hearing your name and stuff of that

68
00:04:31.248 --> 00:04:36.353
nature, they're like, especially me,
I had this problem with the why.

69
00:04:36.353 --> 00:04:40.938
Where, that's when I could tell
the bias was starting to come in and

70
00:04:40.938 --> 00:04:44.640
I'm like, okay,
this part isn't gonna be as good for

71
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.029
my data,
because I'm not gonna be able to use it.

72
00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.391
Because I know that these
people know who I am now.

73
00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:56.887
Like, HR didn't know who I was, but
the coders knew who I was, at least one.

74
00:04:56.887 --> 00:04:59.435
And they were like, he's so cool.

75
00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:03.512
You may have started Googling me and
started wondering, no,

76
00:05:03.512 --> 00:05:05.626
cuz every self-centered jerk,

77
00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:10.245
I have Google updates whenever people
are Googling like crazy, right?

78
00:05:10.245 --> 00:05:13.050
On what's happening in the streets.

79
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.136
So I knew that the data wasn't gonna be as
clean for that, but I still got that offer

80
00:05:18.136 --> 00:05:23.464
and I was like, okay, I know that right up
until this point, the data wasn't clean.

81
00:05:23.464 --> 00:05:25.335
So that's where bias starts.

82
00:05:25.335 --> 00:05:29.034
Once the developers start getting into
play, particularly when it comes to

83
00:05:29.034 --> 00:05:32.055
networking and things,
that's when bias can get into play.

84
00:05:32.055 --> 00:05:36.962
Now, it can get into play earlier, but
for me, bias didn't really get into

85
00:05:36.962 --> 00:05:41.272
play until after the human software
engineer got into it, right?

86
00:05:41.272 --> 00:05:46.215
So that can be taken as positive or
negative.

87
00:05:46.215 --> 00:05:49.644
But after that loop,
after you get to go no-go and

88
00:05:49.644 --> 00:05:52.347
you start with the, this is the offer.

89
00:05:52.347 --> 00:05:55.840
I always send the first offer back,
you always negotiate the offer, and

90
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.204
you don't just have negotiating money, you
negotiate the budget for learning, right?

91
00:06:00.204 --> 00:06:03.588
How many of you have negotiated,
hey, guess what, can you pay for

92
00:06:03.588 --> 00:06:04.747
my Frontendmasters?

93
00:06:04.747 --> 00:06:06.461
I've done that.

94
00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:09.288
Can you pay for the tickets for
a conference once a year?

95
00:06:09.288 --> 00:06:13.176
Can you do that all these other
things that are on the table beyond

96
00:06:13.176 --> 00:06:15.483
just a salary, like, you know what?

97
00:06:15.483 --> 00:06:20.209
Just not being able to spend the money
on things that I would spend money on to

98
00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:24.956
be good at my job is just as important
as me having the money itself, right?

99
00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:26.848
And being able to pick my resource.

100
00:06:26.848 --> 00:06:29.391
Now, that's the interview process, right?

101
00:06:29.391 --> 00:06:32.587
ATS, HR, that phone call, that's
sort of AI starts getting component,

102
00:06:32.587 --> 00:06:35.292
then you get the code challenge,
and then the code challenge.

103
00:06:35.292 --> 00:06:38.195
Now, one thing I will tell you,
with the code challenge,

104
00:06:38.195 --> 00:06:42.285
they're not just testing that you can
code, they are testing how you communicate

105
00:06:42.285 --> 00:06:46.092
while you're coding, and if you
understand the performance of your code.

106
00:06:46.092 --> 00:06:51.284
Now, that's why we have to start
getting back into our CS fundamentals,

107
00:06:51.284 --> 00:06:57.252
because there is a lot of big O notation
asked in today's current coding questions.

108
00:06:57.252 --> 00:07:02.696
Not just, what Is the big O,
how do you identify to big O, etc?

109
00:07:02.696 --> 00:07:06.551
Just they wanna know that you're
writing performant code now.

110
00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:10.389
&gt;&gt; Student: Just to add to that,
our computer science and interview prep

111
00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:14.917
learning path has most of our computer
science and algorithm courses.

112
00:07:14.917 --> 00:07:18.596
So it starts out with a complete intro to
computer science, and then as a couple

113
00:07:18.596 --> 00:07:22.915
intermediate, advanced algorithm courses,
and some practical algorithm challenges.

114
00:07:22.915 --> 00:07:24.319
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Awesome,
so you guys heard that?

115
00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.873
Frontend Masters has a computer science
path that you can get on to help shore up

116
00:07:28.873 --> 00:07:29.778
those skills.

117
00:07:29.778 --> 00:07:31.912
You're definitely gonna need
them in this current market.

118
00:07:31.912 --> 00:07:36.250
Practice, practice coding challenge,
go on LeetCode.

119
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:40.870
Exorcism.io is also one, that's
actually my favorite, I like being on

120
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:46.100
Exorcism.io and just practicing the stuff
in the terminal and my own text editor.

121
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.658
But you kinda, in this era,
gotta get on a browser and

122
00:07:49.658 --> 00:07:53.547
use one of those browser-based tools,
unfortunately.

123
00:07:53.547 --> 00:07:56.931
Because, you gotta train in
an environment they're gonna be in.

124
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:00.807
In a military, we call it a train how you
fight, civilian side call it, train how

125
00:08:00.807 --> 00:08:04.464
you work, you have to train in the
environments that you're going to be in.

126
00:08:04.464 --> 00:08:07.848
And that's the environment you're
gonna be in on a code challenge,

127
00:08:07.848 --> 00:08:09.902
so you need to get comfortable with that.

128
00:08:09.902 --> 00:08:14.613
And I recommend you start talking out loud
when you're doing your code challenge, so

129
00:08:14.613 --> 00:08:16.979
you're figuring out so and making notes.

130
00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:20.930
First thing I do is I make notes
about everything the person says, and

131
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.800
comments, and
then I started working on my code.

132
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.280
And I start talking out loud about,
this is all the things I do to do, and

133
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:30.238
here's all the problems and
I'm gonna go now hard coding and

134
00:08:30.238 --> 00:08:33.953
now I'm gonna make this code a little
more flexible, little more elegant.

135
00:08:33.953 --> 00:08:37.275
Now I'm gonna think about,
mh-hm, is this performing that?

136
00:08:37.275 --> 00:08:40.356
Let me see, how would I've gotten this for
four minutes.

137
00:08:40.356 --> 00:08:42.852
Let me do these steps, right?

138
00:08:42.852 --> 00:08:51.159
That's how I go through the process
of code challenges now.

139
00:08:51.159 --> 00:08:54.215
Most importantly, develop a study plan.

140
00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:58.635
Like said I am the biggest, stay ready so

141
00:08:58.635 --> 00:09:02.281
you don't have to get ready fan.

142
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:05.073
I have a study plan for
every quarter of my life.

143
00:09:05.073 --> 00:09:08.837
I prepare for that plan and
that's what I focus on those,

144
00:09:08.837 --> 00:09:12.220
that's the important
thing I spend 90 minutes.

145
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.421
That's the apex of deep learning
that you could get with anything,

146
00:09:16.421 --> 00:09:19.522
you do 90 minutes of deep learning or
deep work.

147
00:09:19.522 --> 00:09:23.411
Cal Newport, love his books.

148
00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:27.635
He is my idol, I everything he does,
I'm like, I literally,

149
00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:32.287
okay, 90 minutes to apex of time
that I can do before I need a break.

150
00:09:32.287 --> 00:09:38.903
So I spend 90 minutes on deep work,
on a subject every day.

151
00:09:38.903 --> 00:09:41.523
And that gives you compound
interest of those subjects.

152
00:09:41.523 --> 00:09:44.889
So if I'm prepping for a code for this,

153
00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:49.278
I'm developing my plan on Sunday,
90 minutes.

154
00:09:49.278 --> 00:09:54.121
Now, executing, Monday through Friday,
on that plan, 90 minutes a day.

155
00:09:54.121 --> 00:09:58.313
That 90 minutes adds up,
the first 90 minutes is gonna suck,

156
00:09:58.313 --> 00:10:03.056
by the time you get to the 10th,
90th minute, you're a pro, right?

157
00:10:03.056 --> 00:10:04.821
You've learned a new language probably,
and

158
00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:07.003
you've learned how to do all
these algorithms, right?

159
00:10:07.003 --> 00:10:11.667
So that's what we have to do.

160
00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:17.533
And build projects that also incorporate
these types of things, right?

161
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:21.899
One of the things we talk about building
projects is, we don't talk about,

162
00:10:21.899 --> 00:10:24.503
what are we trying to
learn with the project?

163
00:10:24.503 --> 00:10:28.675
I've had that question,
we talked about the JavaScript calculator,

164
00:10:28.675 --> 00:10:31.465
the job of it is to teach
you the module pattern.

165
00:10:31.465 --> 00:10:36.303
But people don't know the job of
the JavaScript calculator is to teach you

166
00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:37.715
the module pattern.

167
00:10:37.715 --> 00:10:42.667
The to-do apps I'm supposed to teach you
is not only how to make crud applications,

168
00:10:42.667 --> 00:10:47.059
but also supposed to teach you LIFO and
FIFO, which is, Last In First Out,

169
00:10:47.059 --> 00:10:48.761
First In, First Out right?

170
00:10:48.761 --> 00:10:51.810
Those are the principles that you
start learning with these, but

171
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:52.813
people don't know.

172
00:10:52.813 --> 00:10:56.783
They don't think that those
are the computer science principles

173
00:10:56.783 --> 00:11:01.700
that you're supposed to be picking up
when you're doing those small projects.

174
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.558
People don't understand that.

175
00:11:03.558 --> 00:11:04.973
They don't pick up on that.

176
00:11:04.973 --> 00:11:08.954
They're just like,
let's just do this stuff, right?

177
00:11:08.954 --> 00:11:13.093
And if you're a mid senior,
this is what's most important to you,

178
00:11:13.093 --> 00:11:16.653
having an understanding of
system design and design doc,

179
00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:19.357
how to put all the pieces together, right?

180
00:11:19.357 --> 00:11:23.407
Like, as a junior, you're like, hey,
I'm gonna go to GitHub, start coding.

181
00:11:23.407 --> 00:11:27.832
I'm gonna use Next.js, and
then I'm gonna use Versal, I'm done.

182
00:11:27.832 --> 00:11:30.226
Bow, I bow to your uncle, the app is live.

183
00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:33.801
[LAUGH] Gun finger,
finger guns everywhere, right?

184
00:11:33.801 --> 00:11:34.594
That's it.

185
00:11:34.594 --> 00:11:38.747
You can't do that as a junior,
I need to know that you understand,

186
00:11:38.747 --> 00:11:41.283
where are you gonna put your data layer?

187
00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:42.642
What are you gonna use for
your data layer?

188
00:11:42.642 --> 00:11:44.552
How are we gonna do measure performance?

189
00:11:44.552 --> 00:11:46.100
Where are we gonna do logging?

190
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.456
Where are we gonna do observability,
right?

191
00:11:48.456 --> 00:11:52.960
Observability, that's a thing that people
don't even think about when they're

192
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.286
thinking about their interview process.

193
00:11:55.286 --> 00:11:59.072
Now I have to talk about this,
now as a mid-senior?

194
00:11:59.072 --> 00:12:02.803
As a junior you're like,
what is observability?

195
00:12:02.803 --> 00:12:03.581
What am I doing?

196
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:07.143
You're observing the app, like, you're
observing the resources on the app and

197
00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.855
making sure that performance is good.

198
00:12:08.855 --> 00:12:14.059
Like, okay, that's cool, these are things
that you now have to start thinking about.

199
00:12:14.059 --> 00:12:18.225
So now you have to start thinking about
the architecture of your applications,

200
00:12:18.225 --> 00:12:21.146
designs of the systems that
you're gonna be building,

201
00:12:21.146 --> 00:12:22.775
on top of all this other stuff.

202
00:12:22.775 --> 00:12:24.950
And of course, continuous learning.

203
00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:28.190
If you're anything,
like I said, I'm getting ready,

204
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:29.883
so I'm doing the study plan.

205
00:12:29.883 --> 00:12:31.348
I have continuous learning plans.

206
00:12:31.348 --> 00:12:33.335
I know what I'm gonna learn this quarter.

207
00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:34.920
I know what I'm gonna
learn the next quarter.

208
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.357
I know what I'm gonna learn.

209
00:12:36.357 --> 00:12:37.877
I know when I'm gonna learn it.

210
00:12:37.877 --> 00:12:40.805
I know what part of the world I'm
gonna be at when I learn something.

211
00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:46.081
I know in August, I am gonna be focusing
on artificial intelligence with R and

212
00:12:46.081 --> 00:12:48.770
doing more rag application training.

213
00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:53.348
And I know I'm gonna be in Japan while I
do that, because I have the vacation in

214
00:12:53.348 --> 00:12:57.798
Japan but my wife knows I'm not giving
up those 90 minutes of education.

215
00:12:57.798 --> 00:13:01.273
So I know what I'm gonna be learning,
where I'm gonna be learning it at, and

216
00:13:01.273 --> 00:13:04.008
would like to focus on how I'm
gonna be learning it, right?

217
00:13:04.008 --> 00:13:06.721
I'm gonna be on deep learning
AI LinkedIn learning,

218
00:13:06.721 --> 00:13:10.601
I'm gonna be on these and focusing on
how to learn these two things, right?
