00:00:00.173 --> 00:00:04.237
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Now we're going to get
into something that's not as code heavy

2
00:00:04.237 --> 00:00:09.387
but still important in your career,
which is your LinkedIn and energizing it.

3
00:00:09.387 --> 00:00:13.322
LinkedIn, first,
almost has a lot of resources for

4
00:00:13.322 --> 00:00:17.078
those who are either just
getting out of college or

5
00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:21.649
getting in school for
their premiums, as well as veterans.

6
00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:25.001
I definitely recommend you
take advantage of that stuff.

7
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.902
And without further ado,
we're gonna start there.

8
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:35.178
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So,
I'm gonna go ahead and

9
00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:40.158
show you live all
the parts of the profile.

10
00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:44.956
So you have your header.

11
00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:48.934
One thing I did that I would do
differently here, if you're a header or

12
00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:53.126
you're a banner, I wouldn't have my
face there twice like a superhero.

13
00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:57.665
But we are here now,
it's kinda weird like, what a narcissist?

14
00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:02.477
But it's not, yeah,
don't hate on me, it's cool.

15
00:01:02.477 --> 00:01:06.755
But, [LAUGH] so you have your banner,

16
00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:12.007
use that banner as a pitch,
sell what you do.

17
00:01:12.007 --> 00:01:15.665
Your profile, always nice,
happy profile picture.

18
00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.312
Now, people don't like people that scout,
I had one.

19
00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:25.007
My favorite veteran, Adrian Grim,
he had a profile picture that I asked him,

20
00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:29.175
I was like,
do you have a picture of you smiling?

21
00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:31.703
And he was like, that is me smiling.

22
00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:37.185
And I was like, boy,
we are here for a very long time.

23
00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:40.379
[LAUGH] So that's one thing.

24
00:01:40.379 --> 00:01:46.027
Now you see, everywhere that I
can edit has a pencil at it.

25
00:01:46.027 --> 00:01:50.078
I can add my language that I prefer,
my public profile.

26
00:01:50.078 --> 00:01:54.525
You get the option to change
your profile URL on LinkedIn to

27
00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:58.621
match closer to your name or
anything of that nature.

28
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:02.604
I have mines, like I said,
I'm boring, Jerome Hardaway.

29
00:02:02.604 --> 00:02:03.969
Keep it professional.

30
00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.202
That way you don't have to, no one has
a second, yes, just type in your name.

31
00:02:10.946 --> 00:02:14.659
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Here,
have my settings, first name,

32
00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.139
my last name, pronouns.

33
00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:22.965
Now you can write with AI,
you can post that in, press the button.

34
00:02:26.323 --> 00:02:32.573
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: They sit there, they
show you option 2, option 3, option 4.

35
00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:37.045
I can revert it back to what
I had cuz I like mine better.

36
00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:40.689
Shows current positions,
education, location,

37
00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.419
everything you wanna do,
you can also add a custom button, right?

38
00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.892
You edit your contact info, and
you can edit your custom button.

39
00:02:49.892 --> 00:02:54.137
Let's say you want it right here,
visit my website.

40
00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:57.393
You showcase this at your
portfolio right here, and

41
00:02:57.393 --> 00:03:01.987
it'll display on your post,
your messages, and in the search results.

42
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.512
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: You can also
turn it into a link, if you prefer.

43
00:03:11.438 --> 00:03:17.339
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So I call this
the header space, and you can, right here.

44
00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.821
Now, there's a huge debate going on.

45
00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:24.832
It's currently about whether
you should use the open to

46
00:03:24.832 --> 00:03:29.851
work component when it comes
to searching on LinkedIn.

47
00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:36.570
The data shows, yes, doesn't really
matter how people feel and think.

48
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.992
People who the data is stored internally
from LinkedIn showcases the people

49
00:03:41.992 --> 00:03:47.089
who use open the to work, get jobs,
which means you should be using it.

50
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:52.152
If you're in the market and you're
trying to get work, I would never let

51
00:03:52.152 --> 00:03:57.132
the opinion of how people might feel like,
this feels desperate or

52
00:03:57.132 --> 00:04:02.113
something like that, externally stop
you from open on using a tool that

53
00:04:02.113 --> 00:04:07.033
lets people signal that, hey,
yo, recruiters, hit me up, right?

54
00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.693
Especially since there's so much talent
out here, you have to be open and

55
00:04:11.693 --> 00:04:15.616
let people know that you are open,
that you're open to work.

56
00:04:15.616 --> 00:04:19.492
For a time, I had it on myself just so

57
00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:23.383
I can ease the stigma for my troops.

58
00:04:23.383 --> 00:04:26.942
So I had open to work, even though
I absolutely was not looking for

59
00:04:26.942 --> 00:04:29.093
anything, and having people ping me.

60
00:04:29.093 --> 00:04:33.820
I'm like, no, I'm just putting on so
people won't feel like jerks.

61
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.283
Also, you can verify who
you are with LinkedIn now.

62
00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:43.223
So I have this nice little
silver verify badge.

63
00:04:43.223 --> 00:04:46.462
So in case somebody decides,
for any reason,

64
00:04:46.462 --> 00:04:51.692
I don't know why they don't wanna be me,
but they wanna be me on LinkedIn,

65
00:04:51.692 --> 00:04:57.025
of all places, catfishes drum on LinkedIn,
cuz that's the place to do it.

66
00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:01.539
[LAUGH] I can be like,
no, look at the badge,

67
00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.324
that's not me, this is me, right?

68
00:05:05.324 --> 00:05:07.713
You can also add profile
sections from here.

69
00:05:07.713 --> 00:05:11.727
You can have your core where you add your
education, your positions, services.

70
00:05:11.727 --> 00:05:15.878
You can add a career break for
those who have had career breaks,

71
00:05:15.878 --> 00:05:20.988
you can add skills, also recommended
areas, and additional areas up here.

72
00:05:20.988 --> 00:05:24.797
You can add test scores,
patents, honors, and awards.

73
00:05:24.797 --> 00:05:28.516
I've never seen anyone add
a test score on LinkedIn.

74
00:05:28.516 --> 00:05:33.784
I would not recommend you adding a test
score unless you scored high and

75
00:05:33.784 --> 00:05:36.917
you are a Mensa, or something like that.

76
00:05:36.917 --> 00:05:40.351
I wouldn't do that, that's kinda weird.

77
00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:44.410
But definitely, add your volunteer
experience and your publications.

78
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.140
If you have patents,
add on them, that's super cool.

79
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.408
I wanna patent one day,
that's on my list of things to do,

80
00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:56.424
cuz I haven't done it yet.

81
00:05:56.424 --> 00:06:00.726
So let's get it back.

82
00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.179
Yeah, those are the steps you visit,

83
00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:04.505
make sure you have your button
once they visit your website.

84
00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:07.950
And here no more.

85
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.295
Once you flush out your startup
portfolio on your LinkedIn,

86
00:06:12.295 --> 00:06:15.967
this is one of my favorite
features that I get to do.

87
00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:20.317
I get to save my LinkedIn as a PDF.

88
00:06:20.317 --> 00:06:25.457
Now I usually have my troops
do this first on LinkedIn,

89
00:06:25.457 --> 00:06:31.041
and then they save as a PDF, and
then we go through that PDF,

90
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:34.195
and we make their resume from it.

91
00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:36.940
If you're keeping up and
cleaning up your LinkedIn,

92
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.137
that is the cheat code
to make your resume.

93
00:06:39.137 --> 00:06:44.122
Is go ahead, go to More,
get your Save As PDF, your profile, and

94
00:06:44.122 --> 00:06:48.656
start ripping things out of LinkedIn and
manicuring them,

95
00:06:48.656 --> 00:06:50.844
adding them to your resume.

96
00:06:50.844 --> 00:06:54.645
That gives you a very quick head start.

97
00:06:54.645 --> 00:06:58.933
Of course, now you get the things
that are private to your analytics,

98
00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:04.167
how many times you've been searched, how
many impressions you get the past 7 days,

99
00:07:04.167 --> 00:07:06.508
they show you how many profile views.

100
00:07:06.508 --> 00:07:10.737
I don't know why people keep looking at my
profile, I'm not out there in the market,

101
00:07:10.737 --> 00:07:11.699
it's kinda wild.

102
00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:13.794
Every week I check this,
and every week I'm like,

103
00:07:13.794 --> 00:07:15.952
people are actually listening
to what I'm saying.

104
00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:18.851
So I just guess I need to talk to people,
right?

105
00:07:18.851 --> 00:07:22.555
You have your resources,
your network, as well as saved items.

106
00:07:22.555 --> 00:07:27.332
Show all four resources, your network,
personal demographic information,

107
00:07:27.332 --> 00:07:32.252
activity, and saved items that you would
have, where you can keep track of jobs,

108
00:07:32.252 --> 00:07:33.910
searches, and articles.

109
00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.337
Definitely recommend,
you go on a job hunt, do that,

110
00:07:37.337 --> 00:07:40.925
that helps you start with your
data on the LinkedIn site.

111
00:07:40.925 --> 00:07:43.365
Now, you have your about.

112
00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:47.099
As you see,
my about is about two paragraphs, right?

113
00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:50.260
I always try to keep it
within two paragraphs, but

114
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.054
I was gonna try to make it engaging,
right?

115
00:07:53.054 --> 00:07:55.914
This is a funnel,

116
00:07:55.914 --> 00:08:01.071
a part of your funnel for depth.

117
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:03.801
Well, if someone gets here on LinkedIn,

118
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:08.959
same thing when someone gets on GitHub,
they're gonna be taking their time.

119
00:08:08.959 --> 00:08:14.294
So this is a HR manager has said,
you're a good fit resource.

120
00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:18.869
So you need to put in more time that
you would put in for your resume.

121
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:25.623
Cuz your resume, you're really
trying to fight just the ATS, right?

122
00:08:25.623 --> 00:08:30.984
Your adversaries on the resume is workday,
right?

123
00:08:30.984 --> 00:08:36.093
When you're here,
the person that you're thinking about is,

124
00:08:36.093 --> 00:08:42.257
the developer team, you wanna go deep,
more in depth with your work on here.

125
00:08:42.257 --> 00:08:45.576
Maybe another hiring manager just
after you've got a good look or

126
00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:47.334
an engineering manager, right?

127
00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:52.779
So this is where you start
showcasing more of you,

128
00:08:52.779 --> 00:08:55.770
more of your personality.

129
00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.547
I have my top skills right here,
I think they picked my top skills.

130
00:09:00.547 --> 00:09:04.631
And it's super cool that LinkedIn
decided that I was good enough at RAG.

131
00:09:04.631 --> 00:09:07.081
I'm like, wow, that's cool.

132
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:11.529
I've used RAG,
I've done two RAG agent apps in my career.

133
00:09:11.529 --> 00:09:13.551
So that's kinda wild.

134
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:16.423
But it's like, hey, yo,
you've done enough, this is cool.

135
00:09:16.423 --> 00:09:21.005
Top skills, Azure AI services,
I do use that, Git, I use it everyday.

136
00:09:21.005 --> 00:09:27.374
LLM embeddings, use that everyday for past
two years, trying to learn more of that.

137
00:09:27.374 --> 00:09:32.083
Python is pretty good,
it showcases those skills.

138
00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:35.507
They show your top skills,
your endorsements,

139
00:09:35.507 --> 00:09:39.097
and where you use those,
where I've used Git, and

140
00:09:39.097 --> 00:09:44.045
where I've used Azure AI services,
or I use LLM embeddings, right?

141
00:09:44.045 --> 00:09:47.130
And I think that's where,
cuz of my certifications,

142
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.499
when we talked about certifications
earlier, because I did those courses.

143
00:09:51.499 --> 00:09:56.998
And I did LLM embeddings before
I added it as part of my skills.

144
00:09:56.998 --> 00:09:59.548
&gt;&gt; Student: I see that you
wrote you're about me,

145
00:09:59.548 --> 00:10:03.223
I think in the third person
as opposed to first person.

146
00:10:03.223 --> 00:10:05.343
Do you generally recommend, or

147
00:10:05.343 --> 00:10:09.277
do you have a reason why you
don't do it in the first person?

148
00:10:09.277 --> 00:10:13.105
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I tend to always
write things in the third person,

149
00:10:13.105 --> 00:10:15.575
I don't have a reason for that.

150
00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:20.442
I mean, especially when you're trying to,
it just feels easier to sell yourself when

151
00:10:20.442 --> 00:10:23.921
you're writing in a third person
versus in the first person.

152
00:10:23.921 --> 00:10:28.114
You're like, yo, I'm that man,
I'm that guy, I'm him, right?

153
00:10:28.114 --> 00:10:31.810
Two fingers in the air,
you just want Super Bowl,

154
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.455
whatever number it is now, right?

155
00:10:34.455 --> 00:10:38.749
That feel kinda weird, but when you're
liking to third person, it feels a little

156
00:10:38.749 --> 00:10:43.369
more, you put some distance between you
guys, less ego, more professional, right?

157
00:10:43.369 --> 00:10:44.605
You can think.

158
00:10:44.605 --> 00:10:47.377
It's a great exercise,
it helps people frame it.

159
00:10:47.377 --> 00:10:51.325
Now, featured, this is where
you want your projects, right?

160
00:10:51.325 --> 00:10:58.537
This feature component is very
underutilized, but it's very important.

161
00:10:58.537 --> 00:11:06.562
Even if you're new, you should still
be putting things in your feature.

162
00:11:06.562 --> 00:11:09.447
If you don't have things in your
feature that you can put in here,

163
00:11:09.447 --> 00:11:11.924
you need to be building things
in your feature, right?

164
00:11:11.924 --> 00:11:14.059
This shows your story, right?

165
00:11:14.059 --> 00:11:17.863
This is like your brag document, right?

166
00:11:17.863 --> 00:11:21.397
This part right here,
it lets people know that,

167
00:11:21.397 --> 00:11:25.265
this person is doing things,
they're building things.

168
00:11:25.265 --> 00:11:30.597
And this is what you want,
you want to be able to showcase that.

169
00:11:30.597 --> 00:11:36.088
Even if you're not the person, even if
you're not trying to be, [LAUGH] I've

170
00:11:36.088 --> 00:11:41.593
been called a micro-influencer,
I don't know the term, I'm just a dude.

171
00:11:41.593 --> 00:11:45.621
Even if you're not trying to be more
out there and do more public work,

172
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:48.921
your projects,
they should still be featured, right?

173
00:11:48.921 --> 00:11:52.086
Any open source work should
definitely be featured.

174
00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:56.508
If you're part of a user group and
you lead that user group,

175
00:11:56.508 --> 00:12:01.640
especially on junior levels,
we need more people on entry levels and

176
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.736
stuff participate in these user groups so

177
00:12:04.736 --> 00:12:08.902
people can feed into these and
grow their communities.

178
00:12:08.902 --> 00:12:11.309
Don't hesitate, yeah,
put that in your feature.
