00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.541
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Congratulations you
all, thank you all for sticking with me.

2
00:00:02.541 --> 00:00:04.979
I know it's been a long day,
I know I've talked a lot.

3
00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:07.219
We've covered over a lot of stuff.

4
00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:09.455
We're gonna have these slides out for you.

5
00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:12.136
We're going to do a lot of this.

6
00:00:12.136 --> 00:00:16.707
I'm gonna make sure there's a lot of
coursework added to this as well,

7
00:00:16.707 --> 00:00:21.200
with Mark and crew, so that way we're
making sure this is strong, and

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.266
I also had those templates out for
the resumes.

9
00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:27.625
Now, be careful,
check those resume templates.

10
00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:30.894
Every quarter I will be
updating that resume template.

11
00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:31.800
Every quarter,

12
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.757
when I update my resume is when these
resume templates will get updated.

13
00:00:35.757 --> 00:00:41.390
So the resume template that you saw today,
that is maze resume template.

14
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.634
Our divestment happened today,
and that resume is the official

15
00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:50.822
one from what we've learned this month for
today.

16
00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:55.092
So that information is fresh
as of at least a week ago.

17
00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:01.557
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So,
a matrix to plan your journey,

18
00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:03.378
all the things we've gone over.

19
00:01:03.378 --> 00:01:08.990
Matrix to plan your journey, data-driven
resume enriched with relevant keywords.

20
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.819
GitHub and LinkedIn profile pages
that showcase you and your skills.

21
00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:20.299
Networking strategies for whatever you
are in the stack of being in software.

22
00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.096
And your focused interview
preparation tactics.

23
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.228
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: My advice for you is,
getting your feet wet, refine your skills,

24
00:01:29.228 --> 00:01:31.116
and we'll stay connected
with the work I do.

25
00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:34.310
Support vets who code,
make a donation, if not,

26
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.196
always contribute by mentoring,
especially if you're within two years.

27
00:01:39.196 --> 00:01:42.587
Please go ahead and
sign up our first larger program.

28
00:01:42.587 --> 00:01:45.935
Follow me on social media and
it's where I hashtag shot,

29
00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:49.298
where you get cooler heads like this and
support troops.

30
00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:50.962
But yeah, let's continue to grow together.

31
00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:54.805
Find me on LinkedIn, that's for
people at home, people here,

32
00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:57.164
find me on LinkedIn, connect with me.

33
00:01:57.164 --> 00:02:01.177
If you have questions,
don't hesitate to slide into my DMs.

34
00:02:01.177 --> 00:02:04.759
Please don't, I mean,
people are always sliding in my DM, so

35
00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.320
give me some time, right?

36
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.680
But just to be clear, give clarity
on what you're looking for, so

37
00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.868
that way I can help you in the most
expeditious manner, right?

38
00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:17.003
So if you need to help me meet or
do a resume review, GitHub review, ask for

39
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:20.569
a look at your portfolio,
anything, don't hesitate to ask.

40
00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.478
All right, and that's a wrap.

41
00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.688
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
