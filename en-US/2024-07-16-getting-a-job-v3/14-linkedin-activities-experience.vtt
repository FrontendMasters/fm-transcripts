00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:02.738
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Activity,
it shows what you write.

2
00:00:02.738 --> 00:00:07.434
As you see, all I write about is AI and
junior engineers.

3
00:00:07.434 --> 00:00:13.375
And today was very special tear-jerker
day for me, I'm a old man.

4
00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:16.975
I've been helping people get jobs for
ten years, and

5
00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:19.297
I'm a little emotional about it.

6
00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:25.613
Don't look at me, I'm only allowed to cry
once a year, so my tears are all cried up.

7
00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:27.859
And you get to just
check all your activity.

8
00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:28.849
Let's go back.

9
00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.089
Now, your experience.

10
00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:36.282
Now, this is something that I've been
very serious on working on, focusing on.

11
00:00:36.282 --> 00:00:40.034
I've been noticing people when
it comes to their experience,

12
00:00:40.034 --> 00:00:43.924
they put their job and
they put their skills, and that's it, but

13
00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:47.286
they do not put what they've
actually been working on.

14
00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:50.951
So what I've started doing is,
one of the things for

15
00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:56.286
my performance reviews is I started
taking out of my performance reviews and

16
00:00:56.286 --> 00:00:59.806
putting that and
tailoring it for my experience.

17
00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:03.737
As you see here, you see that I have
worked at Infrastructure as Code.

18
00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:08.662
I've used Terraform, I've used
GitHub Actions, and I've used Azure AI,

19
00:01:08.662 --> 00:01:10.719
I've learned Azure AI domain.

20
00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:14.750
I've been using GitHub and I've done data
engineering, DevOps, and things like that.

21
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.433
I put what I've done in the job right
here, but usually people, they just say,

22
00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:27.380
software engineer, and then they
just put whatever they have in here.

23
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.186
What's the job description of
a software engineer, and done.

24
00:01:31.186 --> 00:01:37.066
No, put exactly what you've been doing at
the job and involve it over time, right?

25
00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:41.493
Every quarter,
every time you're done with something,

26
00:01:41.493 --> 00:01:47.814
I have a rule where every time our stock
divest in Microsoft, I update my LinkedIn,

27
00:01:47.814 --> 00:01:52.897
I update my resume, I update my GitHub,
I go through everything.

28
00:01:52.897 --> 00:01:57.346
I audit every component every quarter,
right?

29
00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.361
Because that is what you need to be doing,

30
00:01:59.361 --> 00:02:02.254
you have to be serious about
taking control of your career.

31
00:02:02.254 --> 00:02:03.008
You have to audit.

32
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:06.274
I audit my skills in comparison
to the company I'm at,

33
00:02:06.274 --> 00:02:09.470
in comparison to the companies
I wanna be at, right?

34
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.257
Right now,

35
00:02:10.257 --> 00:02:15.230
there's a lot more computer science
interviewing going on in the market.

36
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.327
So guess what?

37
00:02:16.327 --> 00:02:18.255
Now I'm doing more LeetCode.

38
00:02:18.255 --> 00:02:22.759
Ten years, I've never needed LeetCode, but
I know that even at the top of the game,

39
00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.686
they're asking for
computer science fundamentals.

40
00:02:25.686 --> 00:02:28.987
I don't wanna be, if I do
an informational, I wanna be ready.

41
00:02:28.987 --> 00:02:31.864
I wanna stay ready so
I don't have to get ready, right?

42
00:02:31.864 --> 00:02:35.186
And some people call it paranoia.

43
00:02:35.186 --> 00:02:40.272
I came into tech from the Great Recession,
and since then, I've always been

44
00:02:40.272 --> 00:02:45.844
a kind of aggressive type when it comes to
my career and controlling that narrative.

45
00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:51.418
But in this current market, which is
kinda like a inside-out recession,

46
00:02:51.418 --> 00:02:57.445
when you think of it from $87,000 on up,
it's essentially a recession.

47
00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:02.406
But if you're making $50,000 and
below, it's a flush market.

48
00:03:02.406 --> 00:03:08.032
You have to start thinking about
your career more critically and

49
00:03:08.032 --> 00:03:13.345
being more aggressive in having more,
tightening the reels

50
00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:19.510
on your career a lot more, which is
what I really want people to start.

51
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.645
I'm hoping people start doing, right?

52
00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:27.369
Now, I don't have one for everything cuz
some things are just so ambiguous, but

53
00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:29.398
I have even my LinkedIn Learning.

54
00:03:29.398 --> 00:03:30.119
I have one of them.

55
00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:33.224
This is a great opportunity
where you use AI as well.

56
00:03:33.224 --> 00:03:36.329
If you wanna do prompt engineering,
go take the things that you're doing,

57
00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.545
put it in there and be like, hey, yo,
can you clean this up, summarize this?

58
00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:41.895
I am such a big fan of Grammarly.

59
00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:43.859
[LAUGH] These days like, y'all,

60
00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.004
it makes me sound like I'm
not a hillbilly from Memphis.

61
00:03:47.004 --> 00:03:48.765
This is awesome.

62
00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:50.075
I absolutely love it.

63
00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:56.734
But I do the Frontend Masters, talk about
what I've done at Frontend Masters.

64
00:03:56.734 --> 00:03:57.871
I'm explicit.

65
00:03:57.871 --> 00:04:02.405
I say the training, the things I do,
I do that with all of my experiences.

66
00:04:02.405 --> 00:04:06.758
I have, as you see,
I have paragraphs, every single one.

67
00:04:06.758 --> 00:04:10.292
I will go back, and I went back and

68
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:16.241
I literally went all the way
to my first job, Air Force.

69
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.795
And I was like, let me go and
put exactly what I did in the air.

70
00:04:19.795 --> 00:04:21.083
I went and got EPRs.

71
00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:26.387
I went into a box in my attic and
got old EPRs that are absolutely

72
00:04:26.387 --> 00:04:32.508
useless right now, beyond proving that,
hey, I did some wild stuff.

73
00:04:32.508 --> 00:04:37.154
And there's one EPR that
shows I didn't get a medal in

74
00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:40.568
Iraq one time because we were playing.

75
00:04:40.568 --> 00:04:44.543
They caught us playing games with
the Iraqi kids instead of not

76
00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:46.081
connecting with them.

77
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:49.058
And so I have a literal bullet on, hey,

78
00:04:49.058 --> 00:04:53.854
they refused to give me a medal
because I was being nice in Iraq.

79
00:04:53.854 --> 00:04:57.376
It's a very weird story
that is over whiskey.

80
00:04:57.376 --> 00:05:02.817
But yeah, I have that right here,
everything that I have right here.

81
00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:06.968
For every job, showcase what I did,
showcase my value.

82
00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:08.855
I'm trying to always add value.

83
00:05:08.855 --> 00:05:16.133
I wanna make sure people know I'm
adding value to every role that I'm at.

84
00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:22.198
Even on the contract stuff I do,
the Frontend Masters, I'm adding value.

85
00:05:22.198 --> 00:05:25.727
I don't think I haven't done that so
far as the contract for

86
00:05:25.727 --> 00:05:29.406
my record because I don't know
exactly how I do so much stuff.

87
00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:34.016
I don't know where to add that and
value it yet, I can't put it concretely.

88
00:05:34.016 --> 00:05:36.380
But that's how I do it,
I format my education.

89
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.315
Now, this is the one place I
did put my education at, but

90
00:05:39.315 --> 00:05:42.579
I don't put it on my resume, and
I do get asked that question.

91
00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:47.968
But as you see, it's criminal justice.

92
00:05:47.968 --> 00:05:51.453
I don't really get asked a lot
of questions about that unless I

93
00:05:51.453 --> 00:05:55.946
go government, because of the fact that
they wanna get your transcriptions and

94
00:05:55.946 --> 00:05:57.033
things like that.

95
00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:00.115
They wanna get verification of,
you went to college.

96
00:06:00.115 --> 00:06:07.598
However, you don't have to put it on
there, but if you do, that is fine.

97
00:06:07.598 --> 00:06:11.984
My degree is useless, I always say
I use it to deal with my kids.

98
00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:16.722
I just had a new package of dog biscuits
arrive, and what you can see in me,

99
00:06:16.722 --> 00:06:17.799
check my phone.

100
00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:23.605
I've been making sure that the children
know, don't overfeed the dogs on treats.

101
00:06:23.605 --> 00:06:30.838
Because that's a problem that I have as
a dad these days, which is a good problem.

102
00:06:30.838 --> 00:06:37.133
Certifications, now, we talked about
the importance of certifications earlier.

103
00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:42.224
One thing that I will also showcase,
not all certifications are equal.

104
00:06:42.224 --> 00:06:46.453
Like we've said, CompTIA doesn't have
the same weight as going through

105
00:06:46.453 --> 00:06:49.875
the Microsoft Azure one or
the AWS one when you go with that.

106
00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:53.767
Same way as, I don't feel like
the LinkedIn certifications have the exact

107
00:06:53.767 --> 00:06:56.692
same weight as those when it
comes to the job interview.

108
00:06:56.692 --> 00:07:01.267
However, I do feel like the LinkedIn
LinkedIn certifications have more

109
00:07:01.267 --> 00:07:04.949
weight when it comes to getting
rankings in the searches.

110
00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.307
I have been noticing what
I've been calling LEO,

111
00:07:09.307 --> 00:07:15.962
which is LinkedIn engine optimization,
treating it like its own browser.

112
00:07:15.962 --> 00:07:21.548
That the more stuff that you do that
is in the ecosystem of LinkedIn,

113
00:07:21.548 --> 00:07:23.316
the higher you rank.

114
00:07:23.316 --> 00:07:27.911
So if you're in the job market and
you're going through LinkedIn Learning,

115
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:31.249
get those certifications,
add them to your LinkedIn.

116
00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:34.805
And now you're gonna start ranking
higher for these keywords.

117
00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:39.772
And as we saw, they automatically add
the key words or the skills you're

118
00:07:39.772 --> 00:07:44.750
supposed to be getting to your top
skills and they feature them, right?

119
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:51.506
So because I did the AI 900 Fundamentals
prep course and I got the certification,

120
00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:56.645
it automatically added LL embeddings
to my skill set even though

121
00:07:56.645 --> 00:08:02.285
there's no way they can verify that
I have worked with LL embeddings.

122
00:08:02.285 --> 00:08:08.461
But because I've done four different
courses that involve that, they're like,

123
00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:13.392
yeah, you got the certs, LL embeddings
is a skill of his now, right?

124
00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.682
Well, the same way as these.

125
00:08:14.682 --> 00:08:17.274
Well, they added web like when Lynda.com,

126
00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:21.239
I'd probably get rid of these cuz
this LinkedIn Learning was Lynda.

127
00:08:21.239 --> 00:08:22.686
This is still old school.

128
00:08:22.686 --> 00:08:25.720
But when we come here, right,

129
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:31.333
they added skills of web design
directly to my LinkedIn.

130
00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:35.632
So that's my opinion on these
types of certifications.

131
00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:37.163
We'll go through LinkedIn Learning.

132
00:08:37.163 --> 00:08:39.189
I do feel like LinkedIn Learning
is a great resource.

133
00:08:39.189 --> 00:08:40.358
They've gotten so much better.

134
00:08:40.358 --> 00:08:44.986
And with the whole code spaces and
artificial intelligence,

135
00:08:44.986 --> 00:08:50.065
if you all have not checked it out,
it's really, really good now.

136
00:08:50.065 --> 00:08:54.486
But the only advantage it has,
what I see, is LEL.

137
00:08:54.486 --> 00:08:57.557
When it comes to the frontend,
I still come here.

138
00:08:57.557 --> 00:08:58.597
I go different places in life.

139
00:08:58.597 --> 00:09:03.082
If I was to go to PHP, I go to one place,
I go to frontend, I go one place.

140
00:09:03.082 --> 00:09:06.082
If I just wanna hack the system,
I go to LinkedIn.
