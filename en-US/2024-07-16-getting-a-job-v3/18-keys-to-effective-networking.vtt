00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:03.403
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Add
value consistently, right?

2
00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:07.910
That is something that people do
not understand about networking.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.875
I am trying to always add value
to the people I work with and

4
00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:14.953
I want to network with.

5
00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:21.788
I want, when I have a W,
it's all of our wins, right?

6
00:00:21.788 --> 00:00:24.508
When you have a W, it's all of our W.

7
00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:28.002
I'm celebrating your win.

8
00:00:28.002 --> 00:00:31.852
I make sure I'm around people
where the wins are ethical and

9
00:00:31.852 --> 00:00:35.012
I have no problem celebrating those Ws,
right?

10
00:00:35.012 --> 00:00:37.110
And I want the exact same thing for me.

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.981
So that's where you wanna add value.

12
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:42.597
I'm the biggest cheerleader, Frontend
Masters did something cool, I'm like, yes.

13
00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:46.880
I'm like, even if they don't share
my articles or my workshops,

14
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.251
I'm sitting there sharing
other people's stuff.

15
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:55.194
I'm nagging, I nagged Mark on
Cody Lindley's Frontend Handbook for

16
00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:59.129
two years before they dropped
a new one cuz I wanted one so

17
00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.911
bad cuz I loved that resource, right?

18
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:05.163
Not, I want to take over that,
no, I want that resource.

19
00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:10.228
Cuz that's how good it is, I've never
met Cody Lindley, I couldn't pick him

20
00:01:10.228 --> 00:01:15.623
out of a lineup, but I love that resource,
and I'm like, no, I want more of that.

21
00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:20.606
My troops want that, I want that,
we need that out here in these streets.

22
00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:25.699
They just dropped it about a month ago,
read it front or

23
00:01:25.699 --> 00:01:30.262
back I love playbooks I
hope they do more of them.

24
00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:33.256
I love the playbook style but
you wanna add value like yes,

25
00:01:33.256 --> 00:01:37.545
this relationship I'm sharing about this
relationship all the time, right, you but

26
00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:38.912
that's what you wanna do.

27
00:01:38.912 --> 00:01:40.071
You wanna make it reciprocal.

28
00:01:40.071 --> 00:01:43.496
You don't want to edit
to flow one direction.

29
00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:48.179
Whereas a lot of people, that's how
they want, they expect networking and

30
00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:51.191
mentorship to do,
is to flow just towards them.

31
00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:55.792
But instead it's like the yin-yang symbol,
it's circular.

32
00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:59.539
It's you're always flowing into
each other, flowing and pouring.

33
00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.512
So add your value consistently.

34
00:02:04.512 --> 00:02:07.562
Product feedback loop for
junior developers.

35
00:02:07.562 --> 00:02:11.293
Junior developers, for
every time you send a resume,

36
00:02:11.293 --> 00:02:16.171
you should be building three features or
doing three commits, right?

37
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:17.377
Four commits.

38
00:02:17.377 --> 00:02:20.557
I see too many engineers,
especially right now,

39
00:02:20.557 --> 00:02:24.872
we're seeing the Twitterfation of
LinkedIn, as I like to call it,

40
00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:29.567
where the juniors are coming on LinkedIn,
trying to be loud and snarky for

41
00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:35.047
attention, and it's like all you're doing
is annoying the old people on LinkedIn.

42
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:36.970
Do something to show value.

43
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.647
Ask us about a product that
you're building or project and

44
00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:41.130
ask us where you're feedback.

45
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.615
It's all you're gonna do is
you're gonna get muted or

46
00:02:44.615 --> 00:02:46.750
disconnected from on LinkedIn.

47
00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.104
There's no need to be, you don't need to
bring the Twitter snarkiness over LinkedIn

48
00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:53.401
and keep the Twitter
snarkiness over there,

49
00:02:53.401 --> 00:02:56.191
right that's why there's
a separation of concerns.

50
00:02:56.191 --> 00:02:59.659
We don't want that over here
where old in our rocking chair,

51
00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.135
get off our lawn unless you're
doing value right like that.

52
00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:05.031
That's where we're at, right?

53
00:03:05.031 --> 00:03:07.925
I have two troops that, well,
two prospective troops.

54
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:13.822
And I'm like, I want to counsel them
as we used to say in the military.

55
00:03:13.822 --> 00:03:17.570
I wanna counsel them, I'm like,
please stop being snarky on LinkedIn.

56
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.633
All you're doing is having the people
that think about giving you jobs,

57
00:03:21.633 --> 00:03:25.839
not want to give you jobs, just making
all the people not wanna talk to you.

58
00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:26.917
Please stop that.

59
00:03:26.917 --> 00:03:27.871
Add value.

60
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:28.935
Please do that.

61
00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:32.010
So you're a junior,
that's what you should be focused on.

62
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.845
Seniors, mid to seniors,
leverage those existing connections.

63
00:03:35.845 --> 00:03:37.933
I cannot hesitate today.

64
00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:39.265
Just pick one person.

65
00:03:39.265 --> 00:03:43.424
Don't DM them the minute you see
them like of course, just go,

66
00:03:43.424 --> 00:03:46.489
you pick the person,
tomorrow's a good day.

67
00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.218
If you don't do it tomorrow,
wait till Monday.

68
00:03:49.218 --> 00:03:54.141
Don't DM people on Friday like
a monster on LinkedIn, right?

69
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:58.493
That's the only thing worse than that
is emailing someone at work about

70
00:03:58.493 --> 00:04:01.619
something on a Friday,
right before 4.30PM.

71
00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:06.533
Don't do that, wait till Monday,
DM the person, say you wanna catch up,

72
00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:08.263
see if they have any time.

73
00:04:08.263 --> 00:04:08.843
Do that.

74
00:04:08.843 --> 00:04:12.117
But don't start going through
your Rolodex and network and

75
00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:13.958
start building relationships.

76
00:04:13.958 --> 00:04:15.944
I'm also on LinkedIn.

77
00:04:15.944 --> 00:04:18.382
Hit me up on LinkedIn
if you have a chance.

78
00:04:18.382 --> 00:04:20.648
Don't hesitate to connect with me,

79
00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:24.534
I love talking to a Frontend Masters
troops all over the globe.

80
00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:27.420
I've done it from India, China, Taiwan,

81
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.875
anywhere that there's a Frontend
masters person, I talk to them.

82
00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:33.607
And I love doing one-on-ones with you all.

83
00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:38.036
You all are like my favorite
people cuz I have ten

84
00:04:38.036 --> 00:04:41.487
of all of the coursework I've seen.

85
00:04:41.487 --> 00:04:46.092
I like the Frontend Masters group
because they tend to be a lot more

86
00:04:46.092 --> 00:04:50.779
serious when it comes to, I want you
to tell me the things that I need

87
00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.984
to do right now that I
can be like actionable.

88
00:04:53.984 --> 00:04:54.828
And I like that.

89
00:04:54.828 --> 00:04:58.943
I like people that want what are the
actionable things that I can do today?

90
00:04:58.943 --> 00:05:01.891
So like, I like talking that to that crew.

91
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:07.118
So networking is more than just
connections, trust and credibility.

92
00:05:07.118 --> 00:05:09.127
We've talked about how do you build trust?

93
00:05:09.127 --> 00:05:11.859
You build trust by executing on
what people tell you to do, right?

94
00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:13.638
That's the simplest way of build trust.

95
00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:17.643
My wife, she's gonna trust me only
when I'm on my video game, and

96
00:05:17.643 --> 00:05:19.941
my wife asked me to take out the trash.

97
00:05:19.941 --> 00:05:22.567
She's gonna trust me to take out
the trash and I'll say okay,

98
00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:26.015
I'll take out the trash while I'm playing
cuz I've taken out the trash before.

99
00:05:26.015 --> 00:05:29.948
Now, whenever I'm playing a video game,
I'm never taking out the trash when she

100
00:05:29.948 --> 00:05:34.109
sees me on my Xbox, she's not gonna trust
me and she's going to be like, uh-uh, no,

101
00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:36.731
I'm gonna get on your nerves
to get off those sticks and

102
00:05:36.731 --> 00:05:38.111
take out the trash, right?

103
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:40.071
That's how the game is played.

104
00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:43.374
But if she knows that, I'm like,
all right, so I'm gonna get done with

105
00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:46.463
this match don't take it,
I'm gonna beat this dude really fast and

106
00:05:46.463 --> 00:05:49.192
then I'm gonna go here and
then I'm gonna take out a trash.

107
00:05:49.192 --> 00:05:50.828
Okay, and I do that?

108
00:05:50.828 --> 00:05:52.962
There you go, trust establish, all right?

109
00:05:52.962 --> 00:05:56.451
I made that small deposit
into the trust safety bank.

110
00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:57.930
Listen like they say, it's like a bank.

111
00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.875
You can do one,
you have a small deposit, you mess up,

112
00:06:00.875 --> 00:06:05.182
you're taken out of the bank lending you
always end up taking more out the bank.

113
00:06:05.182 --> 00:06:09.934
And so I remember doing a small deposit
of trust with people that you're trying

114
00:06:09.934 --> 00:06:13.031
to build connections with,
that's how you do it.

115
00:06:13.031 --> 00:06:18.178
Credibility, focus on building real work,
showcasing people how they that you

116
00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:23.563
care publicly about things are doing,
that's how you build credibility, right?

117
00:06:23.563 --> 00:06:25.288
It's a secret sauce.

118
00:06:25.288 --> 00:06:28.193
Someone pours into you,
then you execute on them,

119
00:06:28.193 --> 00:06:32.395
you let people know, hey, this person
taught me, told me how to do this.

120
00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:36.691
It showed a better result, I wanna
appreciate it, that builds your trust,

121
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:38.512
that builds your credibility.

122
00:06:38.512 --> 00:06:41.616
So consistently showcase work.

123
00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:46.346
Feedback, implement on that feedback,
keeping your word, and you'll build,

124
00:06:46.346 --> 00:06:50.869
over time, a very strong professional
reputation that's gonna follow you,

125
00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:54.180
and something you'll be able
to lean on when you need to.

126
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.918
Like I said, focus on adding value and
meaningful connections.

127
00:06:56.918 --> 00:07:02.176
Like I said, you are not looking for
10,000, you're looking for 100

128
00:07:02.176 --> 00:07:07.761
people that whatever mission you're gonna
go on in life, they're gonna support.
