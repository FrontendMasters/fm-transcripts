00:00:00.295 --> 00:00:02.651
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: So today,
we are going over preparing for

2
00:00:02.651 --> 00:00:05.017
the software engineering job volume 3.

3
00:00:05.017 --> 00:00:05.634
And this one,

4
00:00:05.634 --> 00:00:08.986
we're definitely taking all of
the current information that's out there.

5
00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:11.145
We're focusing on the data that we have,

6
00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:13.556
data I've gotten from
teaching my veterans.

7
00:00:13.556 --> 00:00:17.230
And we are applying that so
you can understand the practical and

8
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.889
tactical of what we need to be doing to
prepare for today's current job market.

9
00:00:21.889 --> 00:00:26.872
Hey y'all, I'm Jerome right there,
I'm your host for today, your educator.

10
00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:28.843
I'm the founder of Vetsu Code,

11
00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:33.223
I'm actually celebrating my 10th
year today in teaching veterans.

12
00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:40.061
I've taught over 300 veterans in software
engineering and helped them all get jobs,

13
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:44.723
so I've I put about $20 million
in the US economy in jobs.

14
00:00:44.723 --> 00:00:49.636
I'm a software engineer in Microsoft,
and I'm a fractional CTO at MyRuck AI

15
00:00:49.636 --> 00:00:53.805
where I focus on helping with HR,
and artificial intelligence.

16
00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:58.017
What makes me the person
to teach this course,

17
00:00:58.017 --> 00:01:03.527
the most qualified,
one I am obsessive about this subject.

18
00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:09.086
You'll never ever see me arguing
about what version of app router or

19
00:01:09.086 --> 00:01:11.437
page router should be used.

20
00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:15.912
But you'll always see me talking
about what needs to be done for

21
00:01:15.912 --> 00:01:20.739
you to get the goal of being able to
put food on table for your family.

22
00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:24.501
When I left the military
after the great recession and

23
00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:28.775
I was told that I didn't have skills for
the modern society.

24
00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:32.545
I had to learn how,
I taught myself how to code, and

25
00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:36.514
that is how I transition
into material in the sector.

26
00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:41.008
And having the idea of being in air
conditioning, the amount of people able to

27
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:45.110
yell at me down to four, and
people want to kick my butt, down to zero.

28
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.201
I was like, I am never leaving this place.

29
00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:53.544
And I've been here since 2010,
2011 I have not left yet.

30
00:01:53.544 --> 00:01:58.167
So, that's one piece I know exactly how
it feels trying to break into tech.

31
00:01:58.167 --> 00:02:02.226
I know how it feels to go through
all these ups and downs of tech,

32
00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:04.382
I started when FTP was a big deal.

33
00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:09.147
And then when we shifted from FTP to AWS,
and then I was here

34
00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:14.124
when Node.js or the Node engine
from Chrome made its debut.

35
00:02:14.124 --> 00:02:16.487
And then we started having react,
all the things.

36
00:02:16.487 --> 00:02:18.553
I survived the JavaScript wars,

37
00:02:18.553 --> 00:02:23.146
where there was a new JavaScript
framework dropping every five minutes.

38
00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:25.797
I remember those were
some exhaustive days.

39
00:02:25.797 --> 00:02:27.957
I don't know if you survived it,

40
00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:32.200
but having to figure out if you
don't even know Ember or Angular,

41
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.699
there was Angular.js and
Angular without the js and react and okay.

42
00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.795
How do I make sure that,
I tailor my resumes for

43
00:02:40.795 --> 00:02:45.100
this one, and
now in the era of AI and post COVID,

44
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.424
I am still here,
still helping people get jobs.

45
00:02:49.424 --> 00:02:54.077
As recently as two months ago,
my last W and I am here to help you get,

46
00:02:54.077 --> 00:02:57.998
make sure that you are you
continue to win in this market,

47
00:02:57.998 --> 00:03:01.200
particularly in a market
as volatile as this.

48
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.585
Now we're talking about the market,
let's just be honest.

49
00:03:03.585 --> 00:03:10.085
Right now, this market in this year,
in this season, is extremely volatile.

50
00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:14.732
All the top companies are trying
to flatten their head count with

51
00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:19.295
middle management,
while also with artificial intelligence

52
00:03:19.295 --> 00:03:23.273
they are trying to up their
productivity of their mid.

53
00:03:23.273 --> 00:03:27.166
And seniors while not
focusing on hiring juniors,

54
00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:31.432
which is a mistake, but
that is right now the game plan.

55
00:03:31.432 --> 00:03:35.393
And we have to see how these
are impacting the market,

56
00:03:35.393 --> 00:03:39.807
it's harder for juniors to even
get their foot in the door.

57
00:03:39.807 --> 00:03:44.623
People who have been at jobs five,
ten years suddenly being let off and they

58
00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:49.756
don't even have the experience of having
to go through the job market process.

59
00:03:49.756 --> 00:03:56.034
The last time they applied for a job,
it was AWS just came out, right?

60
00:03:56.034 --> 00:04:00.105
So, we're in this very
weird state where people

61
00:04:00.105 --> 00:04:04.384
don't know what's going on,
what's up or down.

62
00:04:04.384 --> 00:04:11.844
And just it feels like unmitigated chaos,
but there's a method to the madness.

63
00:04:11.844 --> 00:04:15.329
I call it market math,
how people are doing it,

64
00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.488
try to figure out how to make their
teens more lean, more productive.

65
00:04:20.488 --> 00:04:25.063
Utilizing artificial intelligence while
keeping the people they feel like

66
00:04:25.063 --> 00:04:29.504
will adapt faster to those technologies
and still grow within a company.

67
00:04:29.504 --> 00:04:34.646
But yeah, remember, all these challenges
are just opportunities, right?

68
00:04:34.646 --> 00:04:41.901
If I hadn't taken the challenge of picking
up a random book on Databases in 2011.

69
00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:48.720
I wanna be here today at 2024
talking to y'all about code.

70
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.235
That is crazy when you
think about the type of

71
00:04:52.235 --> 00:04:56.422
chances that you take with
opportunities in chaos.

72
00:04:56.422 --> 00:05:01.514
So let's not focus on the negative of
this, we approach the world the way it is,

73
00:05:01.514 --> 00:05:05.238
but we focus on making the world
the way we want it to be, and

74
00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:09.055
that's what we're gonna do
to achieve our goals, right?

75
00:05:09.055 --> 00:05:13.062
So we're gonna focus on navigating and
winning in this environment.

76
00:05:13.062 --> 00:05:18.345
This is one question I get
asked by juniors every day.

77
00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:21.342
This is my official stance
on leveraging using AI.

78
00:05:21.342 --> 00:05:25.905
Artificial intelligence is an integral
part of the hiring process, therefore,

79
00:05:25.905 --> 00:05:30.084
it should be an integral part of your
education and getting hired process.

80
00:05:30.084 --> 00:05:34.619
You have to learn how to use
the tools that are gonna be used in

81
00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:38.354
the market against you,
for you, and with you.

82
00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:42.242
There is no way around it that is
the equivalent of coming in front

83
00:05:42.242 --> 00:05:46.858
end masters saying you gonna learn
react but refusing to learn TypeScript.

84
00:05:46.858 --> 00:05:51.490
No one enterprise market does react
without TypeScript these days.

85
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.419
So you're hurting yourself when you opt
out of not learning the new technologies

86
00:05:56.419 --> 00:05:59.113
that are required for you to learn, right?

87
00:05:59.113 --> 00:06:03.860
So, whether going lower level or
even going to bigger level to understand

88
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.603
like what these models do and how to
understand them how to code with them,

89
00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:11.375
especially in the era of cost efficiency.

90
00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:15.816
That's gonna be a very big thing,
especially for JavaScript engineers to be

91
00:06:15.816 --> 00:06:20.478
able to leverage because people don't
understand how expensive this stuff is.

92
00:06:20.478 --> 00:06:24.702
So definitely go out there,
learn how to use this stuff,

93
00:06:24.702 --> 00:06:27.344
learn how to build with this stuff.

94
00:06:27.344 --> 00:06:31.781
Start learning how to use it now,
that's what I want to put out there.
