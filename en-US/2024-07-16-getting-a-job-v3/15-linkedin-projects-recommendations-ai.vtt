00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.511
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Projects,
I have one project up here, Vets Who code,

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:07.660
because I had so many other things
that I was moving from projects.

3
00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.361
I haven't finished this for
myself yet, but

4
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:13.490
this is where you put your
most robust projects at.

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.580
As you see,
I've have the projects of Vets Who code.

6
00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.383
I have all the skills and
have to have the web app.

7
00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:25.469
Pops up right here in a window.

8
00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:30.093
I go, there, I go previous, web-dev-guide.

9
00:00:30.093 --> 00:00:30.907
I can view it right here.

10
00:00:33.745 --> 00:00:37.363
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: People see it,
233 stars.

11
00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:38.483
I didn't even write this.

12
00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:39.775
My name is not on this at all.

13
00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:40.645
This is one of my troops.

14
00:00:40.645 --> 00:00:44.678
I think one of them added it and
I got added on my LinkedIn,

15
00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:49.735
which is super cool because as you see,
I can add contributors to this.

16
00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:52.272
So I think someone added
me as a contributor and

17
00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:54.426
that's how it ended up on my LinkedIn.

18
00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:59.731
So you can definitely add projects and
things to your LinkedIn and

19
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:03.834
also add contributors as
part of your skill set.

20
00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.404
Volunteering, definitely volunteer.

21
00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:12.917
Volunteer not only just for your job, but
also externally you'll see how great,

22
00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:15.314
you can definitely help with your skills.

23
00:01:15.314 --> 00:01:19.492
I volunteer all the time and
it really helps me build my network.

24
00:01:19.492 --> 00:01:21.466
For those of you who are looking for
networks,

25
00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.512
building your network through
volunteering is one of the core things.

26
00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:29.932
Building a network through LinkedIn is
a core thing as well, so always volunteer.

27
00:01:29.932 --> 00:01:33.897
Skills section right here.

28
00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:38.742
It showcases the skills and showcases
the endorsements of each skill, right?

29
00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:43.036
Responsible AI where I use it and
my endorsements run.

30
00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:45.766
Data processing where I use it,
the endorsement.

31
00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:49.366
You can show, right now,
I have 58 skills on here.

32
00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:53.519
And not only does it showcase
where I use this skill at,

33
00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:57.416
it also showcases
the endorsements based upon it.

34
00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:00.888
So that is another thing you do like.

35
00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:03.842
This is one of those things where
you should get your comrades and

36
00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:04.945
your friends, right?

37
00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:06.463
Okay, let me endorse you for

38
00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:10.203
this especially if it's something
that you really want your job for.

39
00:02:10.203 --> 00:02:14.833
You want that higher ranking, or you wanna
have multiple endorsements for that.

40
00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:18.608
So keep doing that and
get on to these endorsements.

41
00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:21.103
Ironically, I have eight endorsements for
WordPress.

42
00:02:21.103 --> 00:02:24.293
I think I haven't used
WordPress in five years.

43
00:02:24.293 --> 00:02:26.951
It's kinda weird.

44
00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:30.308
And there's this part
that is very neglected.

45
00:02:30.308 --> 00:02:33.052
This part is very neglected.

46
00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:36.273
Very important, but
very neglected at the same time.

47
00:02:36.273 --> 00:02:41.057
Your recommendations,
get people like mentors, get colleagues,

48
00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:46.426
get team members, get people who you
work with to recommend you on LinkedIn.

49
00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:52.870
You be amazed how many people come here
and you're like, these people are saying,

50
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.366
well, yeah, this person says something
good about you on LinkedIn, and

51
00:02:57.366 --> 00:02:59.519
I know this person in real life.

52
00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.699
So I want to talk to you more.

53
00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.882
This people see this and
they're like, okay,

54
00:03:04.882 --> 00:03:07.680
this helps build that story of you right?

55
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.319
Which we talked about earlier,
the total person concept.

56
00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.157
You want these recommendations as they
help tell that story more clear of

57
00:03:16.157 --> 00:03:20.676
what you are, what you do,
the things that your passionate about,

58
00:03:20.676 --> 00:03:22.518
how it is working with you.

59
00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:27.304
And give recommendations, and don't
wait to get to the point of recommending

60
00:03:27.304 --> 00:03:31.303
of where you ask somebody like,
yeah, I'll give you one too.

61
00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:32.057
Don't do that.

62
00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:34.688
Of course,
we talked about that on resumes.

63
00:03:34.688 --> 00:03:35.380
Honoring awards.

64
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.403
Like I said, what I did for my resume,
I cleaned up my LinkedIn first, and

65
00:03:41.403 --> 00:03:47.546
then I profiled, and then I took my
honors and awards, put it on my resume.

66
00:03:47.546 --> 00:03:49.001
We'll put your honors and rewards.

67
00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:51.804
Now, with honors and rewards on LinkedIn,

68
00:03:51.804 --> 00:03:55.685
I treat it differently than honors and
rewards on my resume.

69
00:03:56.795 --> 00:04:01.693
I put anything community, anything
that looks good for social impact,

70
00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:05.623
all that stuff on my LinkedIn,
as opposed to on my resume,

71
00:04:05.623 --> 00:04:11.025
because on LinkedIn it looks good showcase
that you're doing good community.

72
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:16.785
If you notice,
every company has a social impact angle.

73
00:04:16.785 --> 00:04:22.254
So seeing that you're participating in
those social impact angles that helps when

74
00:04:22.254 --> 00:04:27.971
it comes to jobs, that helps when it comes
to like, are you a team player, right?

75
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:28.791
That's what they wanna know.

76
00:04:28.791 --> 00:04:30.231
That's what it shows, right?

77
00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:37.327
So when I'm showing, yeah,
I'm a member of these communities.

78
00:04:37.327 --> 00:04:40.207
I've been in Twilio, I've been in Google,
I've been in GitHub,

79
00:04:40.207 --> 00:04:42.033
I've been a member of these communities.

80
00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.917
I've been there, I've been considered
a high level member in that.

81
00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:48.288
I'm doing work in that.

82
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:51.593
I was asked to join the Forbes
black community where

83
00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:55.263
you're doing great things for
minorities and communities.

84
00:04:55.263 --> 00:04:58.118
Please help, sure, cool.

85
00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:00.583
That's what you always want to showcase.

86
00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:02.927
Languages, and of course, interest.

87
00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:04.883
Interest doesn't have a lot of impact.

88
00:05:04.883 --> 00:05:06.773
You can go ahead and forgo that.

89
00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:10.588
I pick interest just because
it helps flesh it out more,

90
00:05:10.588 --> 00:05:15.537
but it showcases the voices you listen to,
Microsoft, the companies,

91
00:05:15.537 --> 00:05:19.283
the groups you're in,
newsletters, schools.

92
00:05:19.283 --> 00:05:23.446
Now, what really helps with this that
you can leverage is when you're on

93
00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:26.518
the networking side,
you go somebody's interest,

94
00:05:26.518 --> 00:05:28.923
and you see what they're interested in.

95
00:05:28.923 --> 00:05:30.133
And that's where you start a conversation.

96
00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:34.183
Let's say, for instance,
I'm going to a meet up.

97
00:05:35.263 --> 00:05:40.264
And I know Mark's gonna be there meet up,
right?

98
00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:43.517
I'm gonna go to Mark's LinkedIn
looked at his interest.

99
00:05:43.517 --> 00:05:47.623
And then when I see Mark, I'm not gonna
talk to Mark about code at all for

100
00:05:47.623 --> 00:05:49.467
the first 15 minutes.

101
00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:52.927
I'm gonna talk to Mark about
stuff that I've seen an interest.

102
00:05:52.927 --> 00:05:57.051
There's absolutely nothing to do a code
that either picked up from his LinkedIn or

103
00:05:57.051 --> 00:05:58.437
picked her on her Twitter.

104
00:05:58.437 --> 00:06:01.187
I was to meet Mark in real life for
the first time.

105
00:06:01.187 --> 00:06:05.943
First 15 to 20 minutes,
I will be asking him about gymnastics and

106
00:06:05.943 --> 00:06:10.214
what has inspired him to start so
late in life to do this sport.

107
00:06:10.214 --> 00:06:15.302
And I wouldn't let him make me
feel bad about, being almost 40.

108
00:06:15.302 --> 00:06:18.585
And he's almost 40, when he's doing
backflips and I'm sitting here,

109
00:06:18.585 --> 00:06:21.293
like getting out of breath
chasing a two year old, right?

110
00:06:21.293 --> 00:06:25.627
That is what I would do before I
transition into talking about code and

111
00:06:25.627 --> 00:06:28.617
showcasing how knowledgeable
I am at coding and

112
00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:31.553
building that professional repertoire.

113
00:06:31.553 --> 00:06:35.795
Now that I've humanized myself because,
that's what part of networking is,

114
00:06:35.795 --> 00:06:39.483
we're gonna get more into that
where we're humanizing ourselves.

115
00:06:39.483 --> 00:06:44.269
Then we're getting into the professional
I've leveraged interest to

116
00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:48.105
be able to see what do we have
interested with each other?

117
00:06:48.105 --> 00:06:50.961
And then finally causes, right?

118
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:53.159
You put the causes that you care about.

119
00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:57.299
They have all the causes linked and
you can just click one or three as I did.

120
00:06:57.299 --> 00:07:02.315
There's a lot of AI components on
here as well, as you saw earlier.

121
00:07:02.315 --> 00:07:08.929
I come here, if I don't like it,
I can have LinkedIn write it.

122
00:07:11.936 --> 00:07:15.501
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: I can revert
it because I don't like that.

123
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.017
I can show the skills
I have right here and

124
00:07:18.017 --> 00:07:21.501
I could do that throughout
the entire scope of this app.

125
00:07:21.501 --> 00:07:28.355
If you go Here to LinkedIn Premium
features shows you the writing assistant,

126
00:07:28.355 --> 00:07:35.009
you do the custom button, AI message
drafts, you get top unchoiced jobs.

127
00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:38.008
All these things are now
coming in within LinkedIn.

128
00:07:38.008 --> 00:07:42.569
So if you get the opportunity
to use the LinkedIn premium,

129
00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:45.839
you should definitely go for it, right?

130
00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:50.567
So I highly recommend LinkedIn
premium to anyone right now.

131
00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:54.841
Especially this tight market,
leverage everything, right?

132
00:07:54.841 --> 00:08:01.131
There's no such thing as
anything off limits right?

133
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:04.616
So, we've talked about a profile picture.

134
00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:09.831
We talked about compelling professional
headline, engaging about summary,

135
00:08:09.831 --> 00:08:14.579
utilize the feature section,
detailed descriptions and experience,

136
00:08:14.579 --> 00:08:17.241
education and specialized trainings.

137
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:22.043
They are license and certifications,
regularly updated skills and endorsements.

138
00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:26.296
Requests and showcase recommendations,
accomplishments and

139
00:08:26.296 --> 00:08:29.219
reflecting your professional interests.

140
00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:34.882
And we also talked about the AI features
on LinkedIn with this insights.

141
00:08:34.882 --> 00:08:37.855
They have LinkedIn learning
as a job coach now and

142
00:08:37.855 --> 00:08:42.946
as personalized career guidance based
upon the things you're doing on LinkedIn.
