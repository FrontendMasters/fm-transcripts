00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.512
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Mock Interviews,
your friends,

2
00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:06.353
your user groups with platforms
like Pramp, Interview.io,

3
00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:10.270
they're good, great simulating
real interview conditions.

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.582
If you're in that front-end master's
discord ask them want to hey,

5
00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:17.350
do some mock on me.

6
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.972
Ask Mark, hey, Mark, is there a way we
could do like a mock interview Mondays and

7
00:00:20.972 --> 00:00:24.598
you can, we can all practice mocking
reviews, maybe that'd be a thing that your

8
00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:27.929
instructors would like to come and
do with us as well something like that.

9
00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.882
Community engagement, you mark, if you see
this mocking interview, Mondays I'm down.

10
00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:36.682
And I'm pretty sure other instructors
should be down for that too, right?

11
00:00:36.682 --> 00:00:40.347
So, but you have to,
I cannot stress this enough.

12
00:00:40.347 --> 00:00:42.662
The market's too wild out here.

13
00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:47.623
It's too volatile to go in these jobs,
blind and

14
00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:53.805
unprepared on any level,
especially the technical level.

15
00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:59.056
The technical level is we see this
as where the cortisol levels of

16
00:00:59.056 --> 00:01:05.974
the of people spike the most because this
is the part people drill the least, right?

17
00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:11.023
Everyone, even today how many probably
know times I've been asked about and

18
00:01:11.023 --> 00:01:14.285
are brought up in the chat
about the projects, but

19
00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:17.740
no one talks about
the interview prep component?

20
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.525
Or they don't talk enough about it or
they're afraid to drill that

21
00:01:21.525 --> 00:01:24.307
come component because
this is not the fun part.

22
00:01:24.307 --> 00:01:25.747
This is not the cute part.

23
00:01:25.747 --> 00:01:30.235
This is the stressful part where somebody
you don't know is essentially judging

24
00:01:30.235 --> 00:01:34.897
the things that are coming out and other
your fingers then you have that, right?

25
00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:37.158
And that's nerve-racking, right?

26
00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:39.537
I don't know this person.

27
00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:40.971
My anxieties are high or

28
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:44.566
high level of probably should
have took a shot before this.

29
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:46.786
I don't know what, how to handle this.

30
00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:47.897
But now this person,

31
00:01:47.897 --> 00:01:51.806
I just had this person make an audible
grunt when I did a wrote a line of code.

32
00:01:51.806 --> 00:01:53.225
I don't like that, right?

33
00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:54.983
[LAUGH] they just sighed.

34
00:01:54.983 --> 00:01:57.530
Are you rolling your eyes
while I'm writing code?

35
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.968
No, don't do that.

36
00:01:58.968 --> 00:02:01.775
I need positive reinforcement right now,
right?

37
00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:03.953
So it's scary.

38
00:02:03.953 --> 00:02:05.923
And people don't do that enough,
but we have to.

39
00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:07.200
We have to do mock interviews.

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.423
We have to do the, especially now.

41
00:02:09.423 --> 00:02:14.205
You have to practice that calling to the
HR cuz you have to practice controlling

42
00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:16.748
those inflections and those us and owns.

43
00:02:16.748 --> 00:02:21.495
Because there are things, like I said,
false positives, those tools they

44
00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:26.242
might not always pick up if something
that's just like a lapse of judgment or

45
00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:29.670
you say normal, it's a space for
your brain to think.

46
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.723
Stuff like that.

47
00:02:30.723 --> 00:02:34.551
They might say, you don't know the subject
based on how many times you say, or

48
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:35.833
something like that.

49
00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:38.477
We have to practice these things.

50
00:02:38.477 --> 00:02:39.643
It's scary.

51
00:02:39.643 --> 00:02:40.943
You have to start practicing that.

52
00:02:40.943 --> 00:02:42.368
You have to start practicing.

53
00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:45.583
The interview prep when it
comes to the technical,

54
00:02:45.583 --> 00:02:50.198
a lot more, 'cuz we have to start
thinking about performance now.

55
00:02:50.198 --> 00:02:51.447
Not just solving for X.

56
00:02:51.447 --> 00:02:54.931
You have to solve for X in a manner
that while it's still readable,

57
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:56.538
it's also performant.

58
00:02:56.538 --> 00:03:02.179
And you're that sucks because
performing code usually isn't readable.

59
00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.829
[LAUGH] So now I got to figure out
where to do the trade offs at.

60
00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.419
And you gotta be able to
explain your trade offs.

61
00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.354
So you have to practice that stuff.

62
00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.013
&gt;&gt; Jerome Hardaway: Feedback,
now, legally,

63
00:03:13.013 --> 00:03:17.613
they tend to not give you feedback
at companies cuz they don't

64
00:03:17.613 --> 00:03:22.919
want you to go come back and say,
you were discriminated against.

65
00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:27.330
So they don't tend to get feedback
on there, but practice sessions,

66
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.015
you get feedback, you get so
much feedback till it hurts.

67
00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:36.909
I want you when it comes to the goal
of being better, feedback is a gift.

68
00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.689
When it comes to practice,
I like getting feedback and practice.

69
00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:42.650
Work not so much.

70
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.330
This is a good job I don't
like feedback at work.

71
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.820
But if it's practice,
I love feedback at during practice, right?

72
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.814
Because you learn a lot.

73
00:03:52.814 --> 00:03:57.451
Well, when I was boxing,
we had a saying about easy training,

74
00:03:57.451 --> 00:04:00.439
hard fight, hard training easy fight.

75
00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.640
It's the same way.

76
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.466
If you make the experience of
getting the job hard on yourself,

77
00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:10.394
the actual getting
the job is gonna be easy.

78
00:04:10.394 --> 00:04:14.877
If you make the experience of
getting the job easy on yourself,

79
00:04:14.877 --> 00:04:18.704
the actual experience is gonna be hard,
right?

80
00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:20.074
You have to do these things.

81
00:04:20.074 --> 00:04:21.104
You have to get this feedback.

82
00:04:21.104 --> 00:04:24.671
You have to start in-boxing was
pretty easy you get the feedback

83
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.053
pretty immediately a punch in the face,
your hand was down.

84
00:04:28.053 --> 00:04:31.743
I hit you in the nose cuz you
didn't have your hands up.

85
00:04:31.743 --> 00:04:32.732
Take it's not so much so

86
00:04:32.732 --> 00:04:36.213
you have to do these you have to be
intentional getting your feedback, right?

87
00:04:36.213 --> 00:04:41.254
And add it to, I'm sorry, Excel sheet.

88
00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:44.265
I don't know what I was about
to say express, excel combined.

89
00:04:44.265 --> 00:04:49.665
I use notion, I don't use the word I
don't know why I said that in all and

90
00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:55.517
I had my feedback there I keep and
I'm like, how do I improve my game.

91
00:04:55.517 --> 00:04:59.373
Consistency, you don't have
do the staff everyday, but

92
00:04:59.373 --> 00:05:02.058
you need to be doing at least every week.

93
00:05:02.058 --> 00:05:06.991
I spent 90 minutes a week
doing just code challenges.

94
00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:13.531
I spend 90 minutes a week drilling
down my verbal interview prep.

95
00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:15.653
I have one of my friends no ill or

96
00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:20.469
I have somebody one of my board members
if you have a troop hey I want to go

97
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.060
through my verbal interview prep here's,
know some questions.

98
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.959
We're gonna generate these questions on
a ChatGPT, here you go, you ask these and

99
00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.419
we'll go from there, right?

100
00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.755
I do this because I wanna
practice what I preach, right?

101
00:05:34.755 --> 00:05:39.553
And like I say,
I'm obsessive with the training of

102
00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:44.573
getting a job cuz of how,
I know that part is the second

103
00:05:44.573 --> 00:05:50.502
most stressful part is
the 9030 to 3060 90 F the job.

104
00:05:50.502 --> 00:05:53.007
But the most stressful part
is getting to the job right,

105
00:05:53.007 --> 00:05:55.097
getting that getting
through the interview.

106
00:05:55.097 --> 00:05:59.365
So we have to be the only way you mitigate
that stress those cortisol levels is by

107
00:05:59.365 --> 00:06:03.382
practice is about being consistent
with your practice the same way.

108
00:06:03.382 --> 00:06:07.762
If I go out there and I try to run
a mile with Mark today, I'm gonna die.

109
00:06:07.762 --> 00:06:10.162
I'm just gonna be honest.

110
00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:11.423
Y'all might not ever see me again.

111
00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:16.742
This will be the last [LAUGH] get
the software engineer job course ever.

112
00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:21.893
However, if I practice running a mile
three times a week and I run with Mark.

113
00:06:21.893 --> 00:06:26.224
After six weeks of it, you know what,
we'll have a version five.

114
00:06:26.224 --> 00:06:27.196
It'll be cool.

115
00:06:27.196 --> 00:06:31.457
So that is the same we do working out.

116
00:06:31.457 --> 00:06:35.136
It's the same level you got
to practice being consistent.

117
00:06:35.136 --> 00:06:39.426
So by doing this, focusing on company
specific problems, when I say that, I

118
00:06:39.426 --> 00:06:43.980
think one of the things that we're having
right now is people are just applying for

119
00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.558
jobs and they're not being
intentional with the application.

120
00:06:47.558 --> 00:06:50.234
So they're just, I'm applying all
these jobs and I get it, all right?

121
00:06:50.234 --> 00:06:52.422
Once you get that application,

122
00:06:52.422 --> 00:06:57.348
are you focusing on what CS
fundamental would apply to that job?

123
00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:00.460
That is what I want you to really look at,
all right?

124
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:05.201
Now that I'm here, what are the CS
fundamentals that will apply to this job

125
00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:09.880
to that job to this job over here that
I'm gonna be gonna code challenges.

126
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:13.943
Let me start there and then work my way
backwards on code challenges, right?

127
00:07:13.943 --> 00:07:15.788
Let me find through CS fundamentals.

128
00:07:15.788 --> 00:07:20.635
They matter in this type of company in
this industry, then work my way back,

129
00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:22.163
right?

130
00:07:22.163 --> 00:07:24.371
This approach, it's cuts down time.

131
00:07:24.371 --> 00:07:26.896
That's the first thing that I picked up.

132
00:07:26.896 --> 00:07:31.847
It helps me focus on the things that
matter to this company fast, right,

133
00:07:31.847 --> 00:07:34.351
when it comes to performance.

134
00:07:34.351 --> 00:07:37.934
And then it helps me get
the practical application concepts.

135
00:07:37.934 --> 00:07:40.191
I'm a very practical person.

136
00:07:40.191 --> 00:07:44.831
I don't like theory at all,
I think military drill that out of me.

137
00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:48.693
Theory, bad things happen when you
theorize in the military, right?

138
00:07:48.693 --> 00:07:51.116
So you're always thinking
about the practicality of it.

139
00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:53.827
The same concept when it comes
to learning how to code.

140
00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:57.256
I've always been practical when
it comes to color, I hate theory.

141
00:07:57.256 --> 00:08:04.049
Let me put this on the screen and
let's see this thing work in action.

142
00:08:04.049 --> 00:08:05.549
It actually works.

143
00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:08.919
Cool, now I'm gonna use this, right?

144
00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:14.088
So adding that practical application to
computer science gonna help it stick more,

145
00:08:14.088 --> 00:08:14.606
right?

146
00:08:14.606 --> 00:08:18.678
But it also will demonstrate to
interviewers that you know that you

147
00:08:18.678 --> 00:08:21.229
actually you care about their business.

148
00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:25.999
You're looking to have the skills
that be relative to their business,

149
00:08:25.999 --> 00:08:27.358
you're thinking.

150
00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:31.457
One thing I always think about
when I would go into a job or

151
00:08:31.457 --> 00:08:35.222
going to interview is what
is the line of business?

152
00:08:35.222 --> 00:08:39.881
What is the business revenue lie of
this company and what skills do I have,

153
00:08:39.881 --> 00:08:42.949
how do I apply that directly to that,
right?

154
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:46.181
I don't talk about artificial
Intelligence I'm gonna see how can I apply

155
00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:46.815
this to that?

156
00:08:46.815 --> 00:08:48.694
How can I apply this to get out the way,
right?

157
00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.105
No one wants any more gen AI things.

158
00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:51.131
This is all played out.

159
00:08:51.131 --> 00:08:52.074
This is cool.

160
00:08:52.074 --> 00:08:54.055
Well, can we do a predictive analytics?

161
00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:56.945
Can we do sentiment analysis?

162
00:08:56.945 --> 00:09:01.668
Can we do computer vision?

163
00:09:01.668 --> 00:09:02.841
Can we do I-C-R-O-C-R?

164
00:09:02.841 --> 00:09:03.807
Can we do any of that?

165
00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:07.541
Right, that is what I started
thinking about, right?

166
00:09:07.541 --> 00:09:11.361
How do I help with
the business revenue lie?

167
00:09:11.361 --> 00:09:14.211
And that's what I want you to
start thinking of when you're

168
00:09:14.211 --> 00:09:16.549
going through these
processes of getting a job.
