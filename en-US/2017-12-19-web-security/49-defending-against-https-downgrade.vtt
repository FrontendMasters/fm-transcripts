&gt;&gt; Mike North: So defenses here are that
when we ask users to bookmark things,

2
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.220
when people are building browsers and
they think about autocompletes,

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.220
we wanna try to push users in
the direction of saving those HTTPS URLs.

4
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.892
If you enter it securely,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: You don't have

5
00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:29.430
that plain HTTP connection
that you typically do, right?

6
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.840
You need a valid certificate to come back.

7
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.540
When you say, I'm beginning a TLS
handshake, the man-in-the-middle

8
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.344
can't typically fake that in a way
that won't raise a couple of flags.

9
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.630
So Content Security Policy
that upgrade-insecure-requests

10
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.820
thing that we talked about earlier that'll
take care of links that are peppered

11
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.690
throughout your app,
it'll upgrade them to secure links.

12
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.870
Google for awhile now has favored HTTPS so
there is an SEO incentive.

13
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.250
To start operating primarily over a secure
domain, and to make that your main domain,

14
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.600
to make all of your ads land there
instead of your plain HTTP stuff.

15
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.530
And then for anyone watching this,
you should install HTTPS Everywhere,

16
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.620
which basically that'll try to
upgrade any requests that it can.

17
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.080
And you can even instruct
it once it sees the ability

18
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.570
to connect securely to a domain,
to not allow you to be downgraded again.

19
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.980
So there's a browser plugin for
every browser that has plugins.

20
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.380
Should try to go and install it.

21
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.220
Don't do it right now, cuz we're playing.

22
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.130
And this'll make it less fun for us.
