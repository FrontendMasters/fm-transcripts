&gt;&gt; Mike North: So the app we're
gonna be working with all day today,

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.680
it is an online bank where we have
a couple accounts, like checking and

3
00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.130
savings accounts here.

4
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.810
You have the ability to transfer funds
to another person's account, and

5
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.670
a user has a profile page
that's not filled out.

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.030
That's not completely implemented, but
it's there enough that it might present

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.932
a potential vector for causing a problem.

8
00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:33.423
Right, and we leave occasionally half
complete features behind a feature flag or

9
00:00:33.423 --> 00:00:34.147
something.

10
00:00:34.147 --> 00:00:38.070
Or it's easy for
something like that to sneak in.

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.991
And you might think well,
it doesn't work yet.

12
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:41.770
It's not gonna cause a problem.

13
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.000
But sometimes just a little
piece of code can be enough for

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.540
someone to get a foothold on your system.

15
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.470
So where we're gonna start,

16
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.130
everyone will agree this is
an obviously insecure situation.

17
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.160
And over time, we're going to alternate
between staging an attack, so

18
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.390
we're gonna take the role of the attacker
and see how much trouble we can cause.

19
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.610
And then we're going to flip over and

20
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.120
see if we can shore up this
application to the point

21
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.950
where the attack that we've just made is
not possible anymore, it's not effective.

22
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.450
Right, so we're gonna sort
of alternate back and forth.

23
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.040
And I find this is the best way to
do it because you kind of get to,

24
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.830
when you're trying to compromise
the system, that is the best

25
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.940
mindset to have in order to figure out
what exactly you have to defend against.

26
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.519
And hopefully it will build some
habits where you start thinking about

27
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.220
unreasonable user input, for example.

28
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.290
We always expect, we have a text field and
it says username.

29
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.600
And I expect the user to put something
that looks like an email address in there.

30
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.850
But I want you to start thinking about
what are the crazy types of things that

31
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.620
someone can put in there that
could potentially cause trouble.

32
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.595
Cuz we have to be prepared for that.

33
00:01:54.595 --> 00:01:59.896
So I'm gong to be testing on IE9, and
if you're watching on the video, I'm gonna

34
00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:04.925
ask probably within the live classroom
we all not try to download this at once.

35
00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:09.531
It's useful to have a virtual
machine with an old browser.

36
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.734
And I will represent the room here, and

37
00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:18.900
I will be running a virtual machine for
you, so that we can look at it.

38
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.755
But you can go to modern.ie and they
have virtual machines that are good for

39
00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:27.701
90 days that you can download for
IE9, IE10, IE11.

40
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:34.730
They work in VirtualBox,
which is a free virtual machine platform.

41
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.680
And that lets us task something realistic,
right?

42
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.350
Because, yes, Chrome and Firefox,
like the evergreen browsers,

43
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.589
do a lot to protect us from
things like cross side scripting.

44
00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:49.690
But not all of our users
are working on those, right?

45
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.100
So we really want to be able to take
at least two data points, a very modern

46
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.730
browser and a browser that is the least
safe, but we still need to support it.

47
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.850
So, modern.ie, you can download that,
and I will be the representative in

48
00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.310
the room that will show the holes
that still remain in IE9.
