00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.920
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What I want us to do,
you're gonna just work in,

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.600
I'll show you the layout file you'll be
using, it's sort of the top most layout,

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.580
it has the HTML tag and the body tag.

4
00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.800
You're going to add a browser defense for

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.770
clickjacking, both for modern browsers,
you'll do that modification in

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.700
the same place you were doing
the CSP stuff server/index.js and

7
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.410
then we'll just drop the stuff in as
inline scripts for legacy browsers.

8
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.210
Where we don't find a CSP
we're just gonna basically say

9
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.020
you're invisible until you prove
that I'm not being Iframe and

10
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.739
if I am being Iframe I'm taking over and
I'm popping out.

11
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.460
So just to show you exactly where
you'll make that modification.

12
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.448
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Close this older stuff,
so the top most layout,

13
00:00:51.448 --> 00:00:56.342
the one that wraps everything,
it's in the server,

14
00:00:56.342 --> 00:01:01.400
views folder, and
it's called main-layout.ejs.

15
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.400
So here you could add your style tag right
there and you could add a script tag right

16
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.180
at the bottom of the body or
whatever and you should be good to go.

17
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.070
Now, you may get some content
security policy errors, but

18
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.730
you know that we can add those sha,

19
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.230
those hashes,
to our CSP to update it appropriately.

20
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.200
That's the legacy browser solution,
the modern browser solution you'll

21
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.620
go to server/indexjs and
you'll basically just add a header here.

22
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.090
Let me find an example of
a header that's been added.

23
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.599
There is none so let me just show
you how you would go about doing it.

24
00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:51.563
&gt;&gt; Mike North: App use, request, response.

25
00:01:55.371 --> 00:02:00.934
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And then,
response, set header and

26
00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:06.860
then you pass in the name and the value.

27
00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:11.436
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So you just do an app.use,
and then it's basically these

28
00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:14.770
are the middle words that take in
a request, they return a response.

29
00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.961
You'd add a new one that does
X-Frame-Options, just like that.
