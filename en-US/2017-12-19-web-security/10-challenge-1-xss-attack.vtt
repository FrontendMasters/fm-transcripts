00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.790
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So with that,
let's think about our first attack.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.390
So there's one that I'm going
to point out to you right away.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.410
And if you start app up, if we install it,
install the dependencies,

4
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.310
go through the ReadMe, it should look kind
of like what we have on the left here.

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:19.390
And you may notice there's
a little sign that

6
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.220
week that you might be
able to inject some code.

7
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.220
So if you add HTML to the name of an
account it'll actually respect that HTML.

8
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.830
So if you created something that
was Mike's checking and you put

9
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.260
b tags around the word checking
hey it's rendered as bold.

10
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.240
So when your penetration testing
the kind of thing you try this input

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.440
all over the place.

12
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.250
If you've ever gone through a penetration
testing exercise you'll basically come

13
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.170
back to your staging environment and
there are funky inputs all over the place

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.830
where they've tried to add a script tag,
they've tried to like admin and

15
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.350
weird quoting things that are designed
to try to SQL inject stuff.

16
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.280
They'll try to close html comments.

17
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.860
They're basically trying to put things
that will alert them to vulnerabilities in

18
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010
every little spot that they can think of.

19
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.720
Where potentially, if you get input,
untrusted user input treated as code.

20
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.550
In this case, this is one.

21
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.860
There are two other cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities in this app.

22
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.080
One is reflected,
actually both are reflected.

23
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.880
So what I want you to do is,
we're gonna probe the app.

24
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.530
So there are at least cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities in this app find them,

25
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.800
see if you can cause some trouble.

26
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.640
You can open up multiple browsers
to simulate multiple users so

27
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.190
you could register for an account and

28
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.190
sign up as user A and user B,
and see if user B can create

29
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.710
some code that user A will end up
executing just by seeing a particular URL.

30
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.870
You wanna try one modern browser and
one legacy one.

31
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.860
I will try like IE9 for
our purposes when I go and demo this,

32
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.170
so obviously there are fewer protections
for things like cross-site scripting

33
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.500
on older browsers than there
are on the modern ones.

34
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.942
Just for multiple domains,

35
00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.590
one of the tricks I want us
to use today is if lvh.me.

36
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.420
I tried to research it,
just was I couldn't find it.

37
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.920
But lvh.me is wild card domain
that points to a local host.

38
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.450
So you could do food.lvh.me.

39
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.440
They all point to a local host.

40
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.530
But that gives you the ability to check
tap different domains of different cookies

41
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.490
and things like that if you wanted to
sort of have a couple of clean starts.

42
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.990
We're going to do this, because we
may end up ruining some domains.

43
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.580
It's fixable, so
don't worry if you screw up localhost, but

44
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.670
we'll later on deal with something
HSTS headers and public key pending,

45
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.900
where we basically instruct the browser
to only trust a particular certificate.

46
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.680
And having multiple domains let's us
experiment with that kind of thing.

47
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.250
So with that,
I'm just gonna start the app up,

48
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.239
I'm gonna show you how to operate this
project, and we will go from there.

49
00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:30.023
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right.

50
00:03:30.023 --> 00:03:37.760
So I've opened up the project
in Visual Studio code,

51
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.260
and the first thing you'll do is just
run yarn, or you'll get pull actually.

52
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.490
If you checked this out last night,
I removed a couple dependencies,

53
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.220
tried to smooth things out, get pull,
make sure you've got the latest stuff.

54
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.632
Then yarn to install all your packages.

55
00:03:54.632 --> 00:03:59.881
And then npm start and when you see
something that looks like this,

56
00:03:59.881 --> 00:04:04.860
it's basically creating a database for
you in this db folder.

57
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.985
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
if we go to local host 3000,

58
00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:18.800
sorry, http local host 3000 for now.

59
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.330
You should see something
that looks like that.

60
00:04:24.503 --> 00:04:28.455
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
what you can do is then go and

61
00:04:28.455 --> 00:04:32.770
register and create an account.

62
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.710
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Do not enter any passwords
into this that you use elsewhere.

63
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.580
Like assume shenanigans for today.

64
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.810
I'm not tricking you with
anything that is in this project,

65
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.890
but the passwords are not distorted
Playtex in this database.

66
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.540
Do not enter passwords that are sensitive.

67
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.870
Do something like, A, B, C,
D, one, two, three, four.

68
00:04:54.165 --> 00:04:57.070
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Apparently I can't type.

69
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.670
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay so
I've successfully registered.

70
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.270
And I'm actually gonna save
that password in my browser so

71
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.450
I can basically get it auto populated.

72
00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.020
You'll end up logging in a lot today.

73
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.451
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
you should see something like this and

74
00:05:15.451 --> 00:05:17.420
you can create an account like checking.

75
00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.162
And there you go, I've got $2.56, woo hoo.

76
00:05:23.162 --> 00:05:28.800
Savings $47, so when you create an account
you get a random amount of money in it.

77
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.340
You can go over here and
you can transfer funds between, so

78
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.480
I'm gonna say from savings to checking,
I want to put $10.

79
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.386
And you see now I've got $12.56 instead
of $2.56 I moved $10 from one account

80
00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:41.640
to the other.

81
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.760
The last page I want you to see it's
a very basic user profile page,

82
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.810
there's no real stuff here.

83
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.060
This is our half completed feature.

84
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.220
So these are really the three screens.

85
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.940
The listing of your accounts, the ability
to transfer to other accounts and

86
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:56.870
the profile page.

87
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.139
So what I want you to do is.

88
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.870
Find, so I've shown you one
cross-site scripting vulnerability.

89
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.190
Exploit that, try to find the other
two and you can use multiple browsers.

90
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.600
We will show you what happens with
the Legacy browser when we go through

91
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.389
the solution and make us of lvh.me.
