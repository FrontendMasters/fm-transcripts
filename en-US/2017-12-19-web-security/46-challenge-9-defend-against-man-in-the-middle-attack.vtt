&gt;&gt; Mike North: You're gonna generate
an RSA private/public key pair.

2
00:00:03.291 --> 00:00:09.704
Don't worry about the 2048 that was in
the first command on the last page.

3
00:00:09.704 --> 00:00:12.410
So make sure it's valid for one day.

4
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.280
And then if you look in
the server/indexjs file, you'll

5
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.500
see that there's a point where we're
using a module, Node module called HTTP.

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.550
We're gonna use HTTPS instead, and

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.840
you're gonna create a server
that looks kinda like this.

8
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.010
So you're gonna swap out the plain HTTP
thing that the server is using for

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.240
this, and then add the certificate to
your operating system's trust store.

10
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.530
And I've got links for

11
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
various Windows and OS X hints for
how one would go about doing that.

12
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.700
Make sure you keep it short.

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.173
Good idea when using development
certificates, only a couple days.

14
00:00:51.173 --> 00:00:55.779
They're easy to remake,
but if one gets stolen,

15
00:00:55.779 --> 00:01:01.052
you want to know that your risk
is closed in terms of time.

16
00:01:01.052 --> 00:01:03.300
You can always untrust, but
you'll never remember to do that.
