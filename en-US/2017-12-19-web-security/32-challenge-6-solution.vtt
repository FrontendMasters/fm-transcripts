00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:01.700
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Welcome back,

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:06.400
we're going to look at how one
might stage a clickjacking attack.

3
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.530
So I've got a pre-prepared URL,
I'm gonna open up in a browser here.

4
00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.813
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Another JS Bin.

5
00:00:18.036 --> 00:00:19.800
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, what I want you to see

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.260
is, we've got a tantalizing landing
page here in browser default styling,

7
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.930
as I like my landing pages,
just because they load so fast.

8
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.710
And, you can see who's
got an iframe down here.

9
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.535
I'm gonna actually dial
back the opacity here.

10
00:00:36.535 --> 00:00:41.327
I wanna make sure I'm logged in.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think I

11
00:00:41.327 --> 00:00:45.127
might be suspended right now.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There we go.

12
00:00:49.653 --> 00:00:52.142
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Wonderful, so you can see,

13
00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:57.019
the easiest way to get
clickjacking to build one of these

14
00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.028
is to operate at 50% opacity and

15
00:01:00.028 --> 00:01:05.570
to sort of position things
until you're happy with them.

16
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.550
So this is an exercise of
some expert CSS nudging here.

17
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.721
So we're just gonna find the iframe,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And,

18
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:25.270
where are you?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There we are.

19
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.437
So we can grab that iFrame,
and we then want to manipulate

20
00:01:31.437 --> 00:01:37.890
the styles a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Sorry, let me back off.

21
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.615
All right, so we've got some styles, we've
selected our iframe, we still have it,

22
00:01:42.615 --> 00:01:46.039
great.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So here we can say,

23
00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.080
like the position is absolute.

24
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.000
So let's say we go left of 400 pixels.

25
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.960
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Maybe I landed exactly
at where it happened to be, I did.

26
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.574
All right, so 300, that's too much, 200.

27
00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:09.639
All right, let's work on
getting that up a little bit,

28
00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.249
top.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So -200 pixels,

29
00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:16.320
it looks like a little bit too much.

30
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.900
Pro tip, if you hold option and
shift up and down,

31
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.310
you can like jump by 10 pixel increments,
that looks okay, right.

32
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.440
It's nice that we have the button
that users clicking on is smaller

33
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.950
than the one they think they're
clicking on is a smaller target.

34
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.400
We can just put it completely
inside the other one.

35
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.250
So there,
let me make sure I'm just gonna drag this.

36
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.828
Good, that's absolute positioning
is what you want there.

37
00:02:40.828 --> 00:02:46.398
And, let me make sure my copy that and
I put it into the style

38
00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:51.858
property using inline CSS as
all great CSS practitioners

39
00:02:51.858 --> 00:02:57.810
do.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so there it is.

40
00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.950
And if we run it again, it's still there.

41
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.311
Looks like we're at the log in page again,

42
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:07.311
silly thing.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Should have never used

43
00:03:07.311 --> 00:03:12.421
the database for sessions.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

44
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:15.014
and the last thing we would do
here is basically fade this

45
00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:19.815
out.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And now when we click this,

46
00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:22.943
I'll notice first off like
it should alarm you that,

47
00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:27.140
you see my cursor's changing as
I get anywhere near this button?

48
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.510
That's bad news.

49
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.512
And you click this, and
it's like, nothing happened.

50
00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:33.420
What do you do when you click a button and
nothing happens?

51
00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.540
You click more, and click more, and
click more, and now everybody's gone.

52
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.600
So that is how you stage
a clickjacking attack.
