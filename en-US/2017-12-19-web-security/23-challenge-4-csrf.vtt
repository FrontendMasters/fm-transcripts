&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's take ten minutes,

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.030
use that horrifying vulnerability,
the get request, and use a post request.

3
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.130
See if you can look at that way
that transfer funds form is setup.

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.130
And I'm telling you to use
jsbin.com because you can create

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.670
plain HTTP landing pages there.

6
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.100
A lot of these experiment
sites like CodePen and

7
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.430
JSFiddle, they're on HTTPS now, and

8
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.080
you'll get a mixed content warning if
you try to do stuff over regular HTTP.

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.829
So we'll just use jsbin for now.

10
00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.475
But see if you can make a page,
looking at the form of that URL,

11
00:00:33.475 --> 00:00:38.177
where every time you load the page, one
of your bank accounts ends up dropping in

12
00:00:38.177 --> 00:00:40.654
value by a dollar each
time you look at it.

13
00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:43.590
And this could be the kind of thing
where you can just send it out.

14
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.534
You can send like 1000 little image tags,
or a bunch of them,

15
00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:51.349
that would just try to transfer
money from a bunch of accounts.

16
00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:55.225
Some of the images wouldn't load,
images, they wouldn't load.

17
00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:57.860
Some might work for some users and
that's really all you need.

18
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.240
It's a numbers game, right?

19
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.210
You're just trying to hit a lot of people,
and some you won't get, and some you will
