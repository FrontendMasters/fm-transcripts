00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
in terms of how we defend against this.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.040
We add another HTTP response header, and
that is called strict transport security.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.340
What you're telling modern browsers
here is that once you get the message,

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.130
once you hear that we want to use strict
transport security for this domain,

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.060
you are not permitted to make a plain
HTTP connection to that domain.

6
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.850
And all subdomains, if you add this,
includes subdomains option here.

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.920
You're just not allowed to talk to

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.500
anything there on that domain
without encryption, you can't do it.

9
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.210
You do wanna use includeSubDomains
because you can still write to cookies.

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.530
You can write to cookies from
a subdomain onto the parent domain.

11
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.910
And that exposes you to a variety
of cookie-based attacks

12
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.850
where you could still downgrade a user
to plain HTTP and put some JavaScript

13
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.050
in place that would mess with cookies,
or just manipulate it directly.

14
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.590
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the significance of

15
00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.340
that number?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The significance of

16
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.650
that number is how long the instructions

17
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.510
to forbid plain HTTP connections stand.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: No, right, but

18
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.020
why that number?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I think that's a year

19
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.790
in seconds, looks like it.

20
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.170
Someone Google 31 million
seconds in years,

21
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.512
should be 0.9 something.

22
00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:27.401
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

23
00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:30.050
you want this to stand for a long time.

24
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.470
You want this to stand for a long time.

25
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.880
And this is great, this means that
we can save users from themselves.

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.310
But they have to get the message.

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.350
They have to get that first
response back from us.

28
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.560
If they're a new user it's difficult for,

29
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.480
there's no way for
a developer to follow those instructions.

30
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.240
There's no way for

31
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.900
a browser to follow those instructions
cuz they haven't received them yet.

32
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.180
There is a fix for that.

33
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.480
And what you do is you
go to hstspreload.org,

34
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.230
add your domain to a list.

35
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.640
And all of these browsers, they take that
giant list which is now tens of thousands

36
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.960
of domains, and they include it in
the source code for the browser itself.

37
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.080
So on the right is a screenshot of
some names near the top of the list.

38
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.070
You see PayPal on there relatively
recently, I'm sorry, relatively early.

39
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.820
They've been on there for
a while, not recently.

40
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.040
Last Pass,
I'm glad to see they're pretty high up.

41
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.360
They were on the bandwagon early but
basically now the next version of

42
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.800
the browser that ships, like the next
upgrade, that will include your domain.

43
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.560
Now it comes pre-loaded with instructions
to never talk to your domain over

44
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.620
a plain HTTP connection, so
it's a good idea to do this.

45
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.640
Here is the game changer.

46
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.950
The warning here does not
have a proceed anyway button.

47
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.090
The user does not have the option to
take the risk, they are flat stopped.

48
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.240
So as you may suspect,
you want to make sure all of your

49
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.970
ducks are in a row before you take
the step and make this a permanent thing.

50
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.870
Just because once you go there, plain HTTP
is forbidden and you just need to make

51
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.910
sure that there's no vital end point that
you must communicate with or vital page

52
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.500
that's on some strange subdomain that you
would be potentially locking users out of.
