00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.420
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Now,
the defenses against this kinda thing is

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.070
be restrictive on file upload types,
right?

3
00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.440
So don't just allow users
to upload arbitrary things.

4
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.900
Put due consideration as
you add new file types.

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.799
Don't trust extensions.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Don't really trust

6
00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:20.910
advertise mime types either.

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.550
And the more you let your users share
files, the more it becomes just a dumping

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.790
ground for people to drop traps for
other users.

9
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.410
I mean, there are certain sites
that allow just arbitrary uploads.

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.679
And photo sites have turned
into this in some cases,

11
00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.659
where they're not restrictive at all,
and it just becomes a total wasteland of

12
00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.002
cross-site scripting hell.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: For images,

13
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:52.410
the thing you wanna do is actually pretty
simple, and it's already a best practice.

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.660
You just wanna compress images, right?

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.910
Anything that will attempt
to reduce images in size,

16
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.740
it's generally going to start
by dropping online visible data.

17
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.180
That's the easiest thing to do first.

18
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.000
I mean, and a great tool to use
is Image Magic, if you use that.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.250
It is available, ports to a variety
of different programming languages.

20
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.830
But anything that tries to shrink these
things down, before it does all this

21
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.530
sophisticated work figure out like is this
color palate a little bit too specific and

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.819
can we drop some colors,
that is the fifth or

23
00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.630
sixth level of optimization after
it looks like there is some

24
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.510
stuff that doesn't have anything to
do with pixels show on the screen.

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.335
Get rid of it.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And also,

26
00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:41.210
as you add more attachment types, make
sure you research capabilities thoroughly.

27
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.190
PDFs are one that people often overlook
because it seems like a document, right?

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.150
Most of the things we
receive are documents.

29
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.360
And we have system viewers like
Mac ships with a PDF viewer, but

30
00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.120
you can embed dynamic code into a PDF.

31
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.150
It's rare to see these, but if you
download the slides and click this link,

32
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.140
it'll take you to Adobe's documentation
for JavaScript that can run inside a PDF.

33
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.340
So you load it, it runs it.

34
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.780
And this can, for some browsers,

35
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.103
depending on how permissions are set,
it can just start running right away.

36
00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.530
And remember, if you're already
depending on this technology,

37
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.560
say that you use this for your
application, you want to give people maybe

38
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.710
reports where they can open the PDF and
it's like an animated graph or something.

39
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.680
That sounds great, but at this point now,
users have set their permissions for

40
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.120
your domain saying all right,
now you can run dynamic stuff in a PDF.

41
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.930
And that is now a vector for
someone to do nasty stuff.
