00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.650
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The first client
side attack we're gonna talk about

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.680
is probably the most prevalent.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.890
It's called cross-site scripting.

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.450
Cross-site scripting begins with an X
because CSS already means something for

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.490
front end developers.

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.140
This category of attacks is called
an injection attack where we're

7
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.126
basically like, we're putting content
in a place that is designed for text,

8
00:00:27.126 --> 00:00:33.041
but we can basically trick a system into
treating it as code and executing it.

9
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:39.701
We're allowing our content to
become code and to be executed.

10
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:42.490
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilitiesare
are extremely prevalent.

11
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.880
It's difficult to pin down
exactly what the number is,

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.580
like what percent of websites
are vulnerable to this kinda thing.

13
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.186
Cuz most of the data comes froms firms
that are selling penetration testing

14
00:00:53.186 --> 00:00:57.732
services and it is in their interest
to say that like the number is 70%.

15
00:00:57.732 --> 00:00:59.680
It is very, very high.

16
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.370
The number is very high.

17
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.267
It is, if i had to give you
a minimum number I'd say like

18
00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:11.660
more than 30% of sites are vurnerable to
this kinda thing in one way or another.

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.600
It may not be the most obvious thing but
you can

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.810
get some browsers to execute
code some of the time.

21
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.320
Particularly older ones.

22
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.430
And once this happens,
depending on what user you compromise,

23
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.910
if you compromise an administrator this
could be like full system control.

24
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.529
That is the consequence of this attack.

25
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:40.950
Cuz they can create other admin users,
sometimes they can run reports.

26
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.000
And if it's a poorly
built reporting system,

27
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.340
they'll allow arbitrary queries to
run on a database and drop tables.

28
00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.200
Drop all tables is a pretty simple
query to run that would just

29
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.410
melt everything down.

30
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.890
And now you're trying to
restore from last backup

31
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.914
hoping you can pin down
exactly what just happened.

32
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.830
So let's look up here, so
we're gonna be using the app.

33
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.400
The Equihax app is a server-rendered app.

34
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.930
We're not using React, or Angular,
or Ember or anything like that.

35
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.043
We have an express server and
Node.js which is rendering HTML,

36
00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:19.726
which the browser reads.

37
00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:23.340
And we're using something called EJS,
which is called embedded JavaScript.

38
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.600
And it just basically means
that between the percent signs

39
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.970
we can have a JavaScript expression
that is interpolated with our HTML.

40
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.300
So here we'd say it welcome name and
if the name is Mike, it says welcome Mike.

41
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.300
And this is great, but
what if my name ends up being this like

42
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.580
what ends up happening is the browser will
treat it as code, and it'll execute that,

43
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.530
and now it's just a matter of me getting
someone else to see my name on their page,

44
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.360
maybe using some social engineering.

45
00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.010
Getting into a chat system and

46
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.700
come up with the username that looks like
a boss or an IT help, like professional.

47
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.210
Please, click on this link.

48
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.500
Can you do me a favor?

49
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.340
I'm a new employee.

50
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.680
Can you click on this and see of it works?

51
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.556
And it'll be to a domain
that they're used to.

52
00:03:09.556 --> 00:03:11.970
You'll look at that link and
it'll seem fine.

53
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.350
This isn't someone trying to phish you.

54
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.610
It's not a fake site.

55
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.424
But it's a particular page within a site
where I've managed to inject my own code.

56
00:03:21.424 --> 00:03:26.300
And now, we can do whatever
the application can do, this can do now.
