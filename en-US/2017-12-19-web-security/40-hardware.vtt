00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.620
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So here is some
gear I use for this kind of stuff.

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.820
Just to describe to you how easy
this might be to accomplish.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.140
The WiFi Pineapple, this is a Linux box.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.670
It runs on a 5 volt USB power thing, so

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.250
like it's just getting
power from this port,

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.650
it could get power from
an iPhone charger too.

7
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.780
It has the double WiFi cards.

8
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.510
It has an app store where you can
download an SSL strip plugin or

9
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.595
a malicious captive portal where it would
say, enter your credit card number,

10
00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:36.960
$0.99, free WiFi throughout
the whole city of Minneapolis.

11
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.060
Only today, for the next 30 seconds,
enter your credit card number, and

12
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.020
capture all that stuff.

13
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.820
I run Kali Linux in a virtual machine
which we already saw earlier today.

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.360
That comes with tools pre-installed,
that's the main benefit of that.

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.710
And it has a bunch of WiFi drivers.

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.760
In Linux,
you have to install some kernel extensions

17
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.600
to support a wide range of wireless cards.

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.370
This is set up to already
be oriented towards that.

19
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.410
And then finally, this little thing here.

20
00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.640
It is a WiFi antenna and a radio that

21
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.710
it's about between 10 and 15 times more
powerful than what you have in your laptop

22
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.220
because you don't want to drain
the battery any more than is necessary so

23
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.990
they don't install mega WiFI
radios in these laptops.

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.560
And additionally it's a little big and so

25
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.300
you have a light antenna I have an antenna
that could hit another building from here.

26
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.080
And the idea is you can cast a huge net
and effect a broad range of people.

27
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.370
And also have a very, very strong signal
because devices will have a bias for

28
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.010
joining a super strong WiFi signal.

29
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.580
You wanna join the five bars,
not the one bar, right?

30
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.240
So the WiFi Pineapple's about $100
if you can get it on sale and

31
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.260
I think it was 9.99 for this thing.

32
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.640
You don't need a whole lot of
investment to cause trouble with this,

33
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.860
I say this because anybody could do it.

34
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.420
They make little wired devices, I believe
this even comes with the tape on it and

35
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.070
the handwritten IT do not remove sticker.

36
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.070
It's just mean to sort of blend
in with every little black

37
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.460
plastic box thing that you
have in an IT environment.

38
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.800
So this is my favorite here.

39
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.457
For $5 extra you can get something that
would set on top of this that's plug into

40
00:02:33.457 --> 00:02:34.086
the wall.

41
00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.895
It looks like a smoke detector,
the lights actually turn on and

42
00:02:36.895 --> 00:02:39.250
it actually beeps when
you press the button.

43
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.780
So short of like taking a broom and

44
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.000
whacking this off the wall to see if
its insides look like a smoke detector

45
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.180
you're not going to be able
to stop this from happening.

46
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.680
So we have to build our
applications in such a way that

47
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.540
it helps insulate users from this
thing that we really can't stop.

48
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.810
Well let's say we even lock down WiFi.

49
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.190
There's one step further here, and that
is to use something called a Femtocell.

50
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.930
So this is, if you have a weak
cell signal in your home, right,

51
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.930
say you live out in the country.

52
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.640
You can call your cellular
service provider and

53
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.200
they will be glad to rent
you one of these things.

54
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.450
It essentially is a little mini cell
tower that you put in your home and

55
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.080
it'll use your cable Internet
connection or your DSL connection

56
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.840
to essentially create a little mini-cell
tower that your devices will join.

57
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.750
Why this is sort of interesting and
potentially a little dangerous.

58
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.810
While, number one, you're

59
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.080
not just providing your own WiFi network
with your own name and your own password.

60
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.590
You don't log into this thing.

61
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.490
Anyone who happens to walk
by takes advantage of it.

62
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.700
The second thing is you don't
have a choice about joining this.

63
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.880
Your device hops on to it just
as it hops on to a LTE network.

64
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.910
So short of going into airplane
mode there’s really no way to avoid

65
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.300
jumping on these.

66
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.500
They’re on sale, they're a couple
hundred dollars on eBay and

67
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.610
they absolutely been hacked were people
can just get cellphones to join these and

68
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.570
they can read your texts.

69
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.620
Listen to your voice calls,
monitor traffic that's going through them.

70
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.740
So assume that someone will man
in the middle of your users,

71
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.610
even if they're vigilant and
they always use a VPN.

72
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.980
Eventually they're gonna get
onto cellular service and

73
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.360
most people are not aware that
this kind of thing exists.
