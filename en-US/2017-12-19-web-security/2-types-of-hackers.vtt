00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.630
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And before we begin with
the attacks I just want to talk about

2
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.190
different types of hackers, right?

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.400
We've got black hat,
grey hat, and white hat.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.510
Black hat hackers, these are the ones
that just cause trouble for

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.240
personal gain, or
just to hurt things for fun.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.365
These are the ones that go to jail.

7
00:00:22.365 --> 00:00:29.276
These are the ones that are causing
trouble and trying to get rich off of it,

8
00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:33.664
or the Equihax hackers who
are now trying to sell

9
00:00:33.664 --> 00:00:39.350
the entire database for
400 bitcoins on the dark web.

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.854
Like that's black hat hackers,
grey hat hackers they,

11
00:00:42.854 --> 00:00:47.829
they're still try to compromise systems,
they still don't have permission.

12
00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.158
They're mostly driven by curiosity and

13
00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:54.170
occasionally these people well
report bugs that they find.

14
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.420
So when you talk about you know when there
are people who are just sort of curious

15
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.160
and try to crack into system the same
way people like to pick locks.

16
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.650
This is the category
we're talking about here.

17
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.480
Now, these people are not, the act they
may perform like the intrusion that maybe

18
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.060
a criminal act but typically they're not
gonna be causing damage once they get in.

19
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.910
They're almost like using
it as target practice and

20
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.860
not trying to stir up too much trouble.

21
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.800
White hat hackers, like if you go to
some of these security conferences or

22
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.290
you see videos on YouTube of like
people hacking into a Jeep and

23
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.850
getting it to like shut down its engine or
automatically drive,

24
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.820
these white hat hackers are what
you're looking at in that situation.

25
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.700
They're paid and
given permission to crack into systems.

26
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.680
Penetration testers fall into this
category, and you're basically trying to

27
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.190
find someone knowledgeable to do
their best to get into something,

28
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.240
so that when a black hat or
a grey hat hacker comes along,

29
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.910
you will have already found the
vulnerabilities and already fixed them.

30
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.110
So keep in mind, you need
permission to explore in this area.

31
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.240
So if you go into an airport and
just start creating a malicious

32
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.900
wi-fi network,
that's illegal, that's risky.

33
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.090
Don't do that.

34
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.340
We're here to learn about how
to defend against this stuff.

35
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.070
We're here to talk about
our own applications.

36
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.390
So do not use these powers for evil.

37
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.960
Something we're about to talk
about is the short answer here.

38
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.720
White hack hackers, they go through
a process called responsible disclosure.

39
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.200
And that means that you will If
you find a bug, if I find a bug in

40
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.300
front end masters, for example,
I would communicate it to them.

41
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.020
We'd agree upon a reasonable timeline.

42
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.140
Say, I will publish
knowledge of this bug within

43
00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.360
90 days from now or
when you tell me that it is okay with you.

44
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.510
And that gives Mark
a chance to roll a fix out.

45
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.310
Say it was with the iOS app or something,
so he basically needs to patch the app,

46
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.410
roll it out to all new,
publish the version,

47
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.080
to witness that people are downloading it.

48
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.100
To maybe send an email out saying,
please update to the latest version.

49
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.650
Maybe in their API,

50
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.030
they can say, if you get a call from
this older version, just shut it down.

51
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.430
The app is broken.

52
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.200
That'll encourage people
to update more quickly.

53
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.670
And by the time I publish
a blog article or

54
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.720
something about it to spread awareness
amongst the developer community that I

55
00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.210
found this quirky little thing and
here's how we fixed it.

56
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.830
By the time we get that information out,
this fix is already out and it's in place.

57
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:46.950
The black hat hackers,

58
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.720
they typically like to disclose
without giving people advance notice.

59
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.450
And if you hear the term zero day bug,
that is what this is.

60
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.050
That's basically it's
a bug no-one knows about

61
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.180
that can be used to either get
a foothold within a system or

62
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.190
to get complete control over a system,
but these essentially are like weapons.

63
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.276
And so if you just disclose this without
giving whoever owns this project a chance

64
00:04:12.276 --> 00:04:17.914
to fix it, now it's a race between
patching and hardening this problem and

65
00:04:17.914 --> 00:04:22.859
patching the vulnerability versus
people trying to exploit it.

66
00:04:22.859 --> 00:04:26.231
And almost always,
it's like some damage will be done,

67
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:31.090
because these people that are trying to
crack into your systems are pretty smart.
