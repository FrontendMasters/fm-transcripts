&gt;&gt; Mike North: Clickjacking,
this one's fun, I like this.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.720
Well, they're all fun, but so here's
the general concept of clickjacking.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.820
So we've got our legitimate web
application here on the left side.

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.680
And we buy a domain that kinda
looks like a legitimate domain, but

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.150
if you look closely,
it doesn't really start with Equihax.

6
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.790
I mean, that's a subdomain.

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.750
The real domain is com-secureblank.cc.

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.820
And we create a tantalizing
landing page and

9
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.030
try to get the user to click something.

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.796
And then what we do is we build an iFrame,
we iFrame the original app.

11
00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:42.047
And we move it right on top of that button
that we get the user to click on, and

12
00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:46.435
we can actually reduce the opacity to 0
to the point where they think they're

13
00:00:46.435 --> 00:00:51.640
interacting with this page, but in fact,
they're interacting with the other one.

14
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.570
They come, they click, and we've basically
tricked them into performing an action

15
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.353
into an app that we can't see.

16
00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:02.769
But we can sort of position
in just the right spot to get

17
00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.806
the user to sort of shoot
themselves in the foot.

18
00:01:06.806 --> 00:01:11.710
One of the most famous clickjacking
attacks had to do with this page here.

19
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.039
This is
the Adobe Flash Security Settings panel.

20
00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:20.302
They have a web application with
a very specific URL you can go to,

21
00:01:20.302 --> 00:01:25.870
to sort of add domains to this panel,
to your global Flash settings.

22
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.210
So you go here, and
this is where you configure your plugin.

23
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.374
They did not have clickjacking protection,
so through an elaborate

24
00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:40.692
positioning of iFrames and things,
there was a pretty issue where people

25
00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:46.117
were able to trick targets into opening
up their Flash security settings.

26
00:01:46.117 --> 00:01:51.036
And then that is an attack that you can
escalate pretty easily because Flash

27
00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:55.877
has broad privileges to execute code
to occasionally even touch things on

28
00:01:55.877 --> 00:01:57.061
the file system.

29
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:59.466
When you say give Flash
access to everything,

30
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.200
it turns out it can do a whole lot.

31
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.000
So the category of attack this
falls into is a UI redress attack.

32
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.550
Just think of it in terms of the user
thinks they're interacting with one UI,

33
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.060
and really,
they're interacting with another.

34
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.244
You can use it to capture keystrokes as
well, and the really refined clickjacking

35
00:02:19.244 --> 00:02:25.960
attacks, they create the illusion
that your input is correctly

36
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.990
arriving on the page that you see,
not the one that you're interacting with.

37
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.889
So they can go through the trouble of,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Trying to position

38
00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.999
things and resize the iFrame, so
only the input field is showing and

39
00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:43.220
they'll position that right on
top of an existing input field.

40
00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.670
So you'll be typing, and
the words will appear as you would expect,

41
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.560
so you can get really,
really clever with this stuff.
