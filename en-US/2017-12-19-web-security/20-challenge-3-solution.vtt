00:00:01.731 --> 00:00:06.204
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm just gonna demonstrate
how you could change this little file

2
00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:10.841
we've been playing with and
replace the content that's in there,

3
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:16.120
this HTML, or what the browser is
treating as HTML, with your own text.

4
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.170
So I'm just gonna copy
this from the slide,

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.600
it's a command that basically
runs a little node script,

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.370
which we can see what the node
script does by itself.

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.160
It'll read a file as an image.

8
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.290
I know it has an HTML extension there,
that's just so we can view it as HTML.

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.010
But you can see that this is the text,

10
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.660
this matches what the browser
is rendering, right?

11
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.400
So if we pipe that to pbcopy,
it'll end up on our clipboard.

12
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.346
And we're just gonna create a new
file here called scratch.html.

13
00:00:53.502 --> 00:00:55.796
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
I can paste the contents of that in here,

14
00:00:55.796 --> 00:00:59.130
make sure that we're
dealing with only one line.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.080
And what we can do then is we can run a
command that instead of saying read here,

16
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.260
it's just gonna say write.

17
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.890
And we can add one more argument,
and that is the file

18
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.370
from which text content
is going to be read.

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.500
What this program will do is it'll
insert that content into the image here.

20
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.498
So if I were to say,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Instead of,

21
00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:29.779
let's just change the h1 tag
which is here, hello students.

22
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.337
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We'll say hello squirrels.

23
00:01:35.381 --> 00:01:36.831
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There's no squirrel.

24
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:38.513
We'll do a hamster.

25
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:44.640
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so
now we get to see if Unicode characters,

26
00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:48.488
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Throw this for

27
00:01:48.488 --> 00:01:49.097
a loop or not.

28
00:01:53.203 --> 00:01:54.410
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
here's what we're gonna do.

29
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.749
We can write to this file, so
just here's the piece that we edited.

30
00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.730
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Save it, run this program.

31
00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.700
Okay, so
it's showing us the original data.

32
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.390
The existing data it found was
hello students, right there.

33
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.465
And here we've got,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It still says updated data,

34
00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:21.220
interesting.

35
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.482
Let's do a refresh and
see if that's just a bug in the program.

36
00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.016
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
did we edit the right spot?

37
00:02:33.833 --> 00:02:37.750
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting,
there's write, squirrel, scratch.

38
00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:43.286
&gt;&gt; Student: There is an HTML file, though.

39
00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:46.870
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That's a good question.

40
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.310
&gt;&gt; Student: Like you write to HTML file.

41
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.383
&gt;&gt; Mike North: That's it.

42
00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:55.097
&gt;&gt; Student: No, you write two examples,
HTML, not to JPEG, right?

43
00:02:55.097 --> 00:02:59.230
You should be writing to
JPEG since it's EXIF.

44
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.770
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It could be, but,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting.

45
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.493
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So, there's my scratch.

46
00:03:13.302 --> 00:03:14.142
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm running this three

47
00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:16.240
times like I'm gonna get
a different result here.

48
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.272
So, let's see,
let's just try to make this like foo.

49
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:30.130
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting, it does not
wanna update my data for some reason.

50
00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:35.350
&gt;&gt; Student2: Wanna try
writing to the JPEG file?

51
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.542
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, let's try that.

52
00:03:36.542 --> 00:03:39.300
Maybe there's some sensitivity
to file type here.

53
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.027
So I'm just gonna change this
back to a JPEG, rename it.

54
00:03:43.692 --> 00:03:46.250
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We're gonna
read the data from that file.

55
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.207
So read it from the JPEG,
pipe it to pbcopy.

56
00:03:52.893 --> 00:03:54.422
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Get rid of this.

57
00:03:54.422 --> 00:03:57.080
And what's on our clipboard?

58
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.010
That is what we expect.

59
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:06.283
So now if we change that,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

60
00:04:06.283 --> 00:04:11.403
save it in our scratch and
write, but this time to a JPEG.

61
00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:17.890
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We've got squirrels.

62
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.941
Okay, so apparently the library
I'm using does not want

63
00:04:20.941 --> 00:04:24.020
to write to things that
have that HTML extension.

64
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.540
So we'll rename it back, refresh,
and we've got Hello Squirrels.

65
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
So what we've shown here,
we can put arbitrary text in this file.

66
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.200
The browser will treat it as HTML.

67
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.290
If you look at the HTML,

68
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.080
you'll note at the very end,
we've got this comment field.

69
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.020
If we were to leave that off,
let's see what would happen.

70
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.890
So, I'm gonna save this file.

71
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.160
We're going to write it again.

72
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.610
Oops, undefined is not a function
cuz there's no JPEG there.

73
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.240
So, let me copy this.

74
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:04.693
So we'll say mv examples /squirrel.html

75
00:05:04.693 --> 00:05:09.198
examples/squirrel.jpg.

76
00:05:09.198 --> 00:05:11.369
Then run this command then,

77
00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:22.356
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yep, thank you.

78
00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:32.891
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay,
let's see how far we got there.

79
00:05:42.482 --> 00:05:47.329
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so let's just
do it step by step rather than try

80
00:05:47.329 --> 00:05:50.786
to three shot it here, or one shot it.

81
00:05:52.435 --> 00:05:54.360
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
there's none of that, which is fine.

82
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.105
So now we'll run our little write thing.

83
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.320
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, and
now we'll rename it.

84
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.593
Just do it the way we did before.

85
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.701
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
if we didn't have that comment at the end,

86
00:06:13.564 --> 00:06:14.757
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Is it still,

87
00:06:14.757 --> 00:06:17.148
now the comment's back.

88
00:06:17.148 --> 00:06:18.733
Save, rewrite.

89
00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:22.685
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We've gotta rename again.

90
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.770
&gt;&gt; Mike North: There we go.

91
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.996
Now it's undefined cuz
scratch.html has nothing.

92
00:06:32.996 --> 00:06:36.070
Is that why?

93
00:06:40.627 --> 00:06:44.875
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I know, I've been
accidentally manipulating that file there.

94
00:06:44.875 --> 00:06:47.865
All right, once more,
I'm gonna start this from the top.

95
00:06:47.865 --> 00:06:49.235
I'm just gonna reset that image.

96
00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.022
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So now squirrel.jpg,
that is a squirrel.

97
00:06:55.022 --> 00:06:59.382
If we click on it, this looks like
a squirrel, as everyone can clearly see.

98
00:06:59.382 --> 00:07:04.052
So we will read that data
out to our clipboard, and

99
00:07:04.052 --> 00:07:07.102
that is this command here,
the one that says read.

100
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.380
Okay, we've got that,
we’ll paste it in our scratch.

101
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.978
I’m just gonna delete that
comment at the end and

102
00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:19.116
save this, and
we will write that back out to the image.

103
00:07:21.951 --> 00:07:24.840
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And
now we can rename this to an HTML file.

104
00:07:27.493 --> 00:07:30.592
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And when we refresh,
you see all this junk at the bottom.

105
00:07:30.592 --> 00:07:33.867
So this where when you're testing for
these things,

106
00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:37.215
oftentimes we'll have
the leading part of a comment or

107
00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:40.560
the trailing edge to close
an existing comment.

108
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.835
When you're doing XSS type stuff,

109
00:07:42.835 --> 00:07:47.290
oftentimes you're trying to basically
get yourself out of one context or

110
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:53.830
into another, or into one context, or
to finish off and hide a bunch of crap.

111
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.370
Effectively what's been done here, and
even if we look at the CSS, there's

112
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.540
some work to, this is why I suggested
you start with this as a baseline.

113
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.090
There's this piece of thing in the body.

114
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.740
And effectively, what's happening
here is the body is invisible.

115
00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:12.620
There's that visibility hidden.

116
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.454
And then this is the div that's
only it is visible, right,

117
00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:18.460
the body is by default hidden.

118
00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:22.980
If we turn that on, you would clearly see
there's some shenanigans going on here.

119
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:26.920
So you can create something that looks
completely normal by putting together

120
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:31.540
CSS and
a little comment escaping and so on.

121
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.350
So that is code injection into an image.
