&gt;&gt; Mike North: So what I'd like us to do
is take advantage of the fact that we have

2
00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:10.100
a horrific issue in this app where we
can populate form field by queryParams.

3
00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.812
This is not something you should
see in online banking software, but

4
00:00:13.812 --> 00:00:17.973
this is nice for when your support team
needs to lead you to a particular page.

5
00:00:17.973 --> 00:00:20.140
And they can pre-populate some stuff for
you,

6
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.210
or maybe we call this like, a template.

7
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.803
It's a template form,
you can bookmark this, and

8
00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:27.044
it will have everything filled out for
you.

9
00:00:27.044 --> 00:00:31.177
If you use your imagination,
this is not so ridiculous.

10
00:00:31.177 --> 00:00:35.033
However, it does put us in a position
where we can create an iFrame that is one

11
00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:36.797
click away from a funds transfer.

12
00:00:36.797 --> 00:00:40.780
So what you're gonna do is create
an iFrame in a new jsbin and

13
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.242
see if you can get the CSS that
applies to this iFrame just right, so

14
00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:49.670
that it's right over a button
on a landing page you create.

15
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.490
And so you can trick the user
into clicking on that thing,

16
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.210
maybe clicking on that thing
multiple times, who knows?

17
00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.034
And essentially they'll end up interacting
with an app that they are authenticated

18
00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:06.224
to use as a legitimate user, but they're
just basically being tricked, right?

19
00:01:06.224 --> 00:01:08.854
You're compromising the user,
not the system here.
