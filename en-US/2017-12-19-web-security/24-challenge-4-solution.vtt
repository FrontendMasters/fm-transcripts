00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.637
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, So I'm taking
advantage of the fact that we're able to

2
00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:08.700
make a get request and
mutate data within this system.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.080
So I've basically figured out,
hopefully my example's clear enough.

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.290
We've got numbered accounts.

5
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.683
If you inspect element, you can look
at the select, and the options, and

6
00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.820
the IDs on the options, sorry,
the value property of each option.

7
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.970
And you can figure out that this is your
source and your destination account.

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.410
I'm transferring a dollar at a time.

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.646
So if I happen to be authenticated,
obviously the app has to be running here.

10
00:00:32.646 --> 00:00:38.500
Let's make sure that is the case, and
get rid of this, squish this over.

11
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.830
We can kill this shell.

12
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.144
Sorry, folks,
a little window management going

13
00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:52.156
on.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Oops,

14
00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:57.920
apparently I'm supposed to start that way.

15
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:03.998
And we're going over plain HTTP still,
we will fix that later.

16
00:01:03.998 --> 00:01:06.590
So, we can log in.

17
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.360
All right, so now I'm logged in.

18
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.800
And if we go to Transfers here,
and if I run this code and

19
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.519
refresh,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's see,

20
00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:23.276
I've got 12, 37, and 550.

21
00:01:23.276 --> 00:01:25.300
I may have dropped this database,

22
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.460
and the account number's gonna
be different at this point.

23
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.940
All right, let's just inspect element and
do this from scratch.

24
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.160
We just need to change
those account numbers.

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.250
So there's our form,
we can look at the select here.

26
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.380
And we can see that there's, let's pick
the biggest one with the most money in it.

27
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.870
So there's one with 550 in it.

28
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.370
We're gonna transfer from account 3.

29
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.411
And let's say if you created multiple
users, you should be seeing the 2

30
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:58.590
account is an opt group select, where you
have each user and all of their accounts.

31
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.020
So I'm gonna just transfer to one of my
own accounts, from number 3 to number 1.

32
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.390
So from number 3 to number 1, Run it.

33
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.720
And we should be able to go back here

34
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.255
when we refresh.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

35
00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:17.750
it looks like we've just gone up in value.

36
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.700
So let's go over here again.

37
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.060
Say that's another page view, refresh,
looks like we've got another dollar.

38
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.650
And so effectively now we've used,
this is one of the more horrific

39
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.430
kind of cross-site request forgery,
where someone just has to look at it.

40
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.230
By the time you click that link,
it's over, you're done.

41
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.300
The money's been transferred.

42
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.710
So that is attack number one.

43
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.610
Attack number two,
we could use a form post.

44
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.230
So I'm gonna get rid of
just this one line here.

45
00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:54.460
Then we could say form, and the action.

46
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.630
I'm gonna actually do
this the really easy way.

47
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.470
Inspect, we're gonna grab the form itself.

48
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.850
Where is that form tag?

49
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.930
There it is.

50
00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.010
Right-click, and Edit as HTML.

51
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.120
It's gonna basically give you a big
text area with the whole thing in there.

52
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.690
We'll trim everything down, and
get it back into a meaningful state here.

53
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.840
So we don't need any of
these select fields.

54
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.270
We just need a field
that's called accountFrom.

55
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.760
So we can say, input type="hidden" name,
and then name is accountFrom.

56
00:03:35.204 --> 00:03:39.975
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And value="3".

57
00:03:39.975 --> 00:03:45.715
So we can now get rid of this select.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

58
00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:48.140
obviously, we don't need the label.

59
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.710
And obviously,
we don't need all of the dom around it.

60
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.411
Because we're not, ultimately,

61
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:57.810
we would hide this somewhere.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So get rid of that.

62
00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.070
And now we've got accountTo, so
I'm just gonna copy this one.

63
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.908
Say accountTo, paste that in,
and we're gonna go to number 1.

64
00:04:05.908 --> 00:04:14.080
And lastly,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: We've got this textfield.

65
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.326
We can just copy that as-is,

66
00:04:18.326 --> 00:04:23.229
paste it here,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So effectively,

67
00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.050
we've got a form that represents
the same structure of data.

68
00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.600
Keep the name as amount,
type is gonna be hidden.

69
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.650
Let me just move this around so
we're all lined up.

70
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.670
We can see hidden, hidden, hidden.

71
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.690
So there's nothing on the screen.

72
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.620
We don't need placeholders.

73
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.825
The value is gonna be,
let's do 100 bucks at

74
00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:49.846
a time.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

75
00:04:49.846 --> 00:04:52.090
so now we've got the form.

76
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.543
And what we're gonna wanna do at this
point is then down here say, script,

77
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.972
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Well, we can give it an id,

78
00:05:03.972 --> 00:05:07.881
we'll say, money.

79
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:10.654
script, we'll say

80
00:05:10.654 --> 00:05:18.324
document.getElementById('money').submit,

81
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.748
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And when we run this,

82
00:05:22.748 --> 00:05:31.007
let me open this up here,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let's clear these and

83
00:05:31.007 --> 00:05:36.250
Run.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What just happened?

84
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.921
Let's see if we can go back here and look.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I'm

85
00:05:41.921 --> 00:05:43.370
not authenticated anymore.

86
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.882
That would do it,

87
00:05:48.682 --> 00:05:53.271
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Interesting, so let's see,

88
00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:58.740
there's my form action.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's relative path.

89
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.709
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It's a relative path,

90
00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:05.104
thank you.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Good catch, so

91
00:06:05.104 --> 00:06:09.167
save that.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Run.

92
00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:14.205
Okay, so what we're seeing
here is the post response.

93
00:06:14.205 --> 00:06:18.400
That doesn't really matter though,
cuz the funds have been transferred.

94
00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.764
So this is one of these where,
we could have run it in an iframe maybe,

95
00:06:21.764 --> 00:06:24.030
in an effort to kind of
keep it all hidden away.

96
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.700
The same way I rick-rolled myself,
I didn't really see anything.

97
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.205
It might have been just slightly
off the right edge of my screen, or

98
00:06:32.205 --> 00:06:35.350
somewhere that I couldn't
really access it.

99
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.730
But the point is,
by the time you see this, it's done.

100
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:45.023
And if we hit Run with JS again,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Maybe we have to,

101
00:06:45.023 --> 00:06:47.000
let's see, can we say Back?

102
00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:53.500
Obviously, the fiddle is
not happy with us here.

103
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.828
Yeah, it's definitely not, but the point
would be the money has been transferred,

104
00:06:57.828 --> 00:06:59.100
it's gone.

105
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.330
And there are ways of hiding it as well.

106
00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:08.350
So that is the form post, and
the get request flavors of a CSRF attack.

107
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:09.760
You're not safe with either.

108
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.560
If you allow either of these,
they're both serious.

109
00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.770
Get requests in particular
are the most serious,

110
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.640
because you don't have to trick
anyone into clicking a link.

111
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.550
You can embed that image tag, or
other things that initiate requests,

112
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.550
like an iframe tag or
a CSS background image.

113
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.840
There are modern browser protections for
not allowing you to inline

114
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:40.330
JavaScript into a URL the same way
that you can do javascript:alert.

115
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.820
We can run that, and you see how it says,
you can't really see there.

116
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:46.922
But it says hi, up there in
this modal that just popped up.

117
00:07:46.922 --> 00:07:52.480
You are not allowed to put that in your
code for a modern version of Chrome.

118
00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:56.380
You certainly can put a URL that,
on the back end of some application,

119
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.500
does some damage.

120
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.230
So that's why we conform to

121
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.160
RESTful HTTP verbs, and
we never mutate data on get requests.

122
00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.840
But you can still do this form post thing,
and

123
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.460
it is trivial to buy a domain that
you can get someone to click on.

124
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.520
If you buy an SSL certificate for
it, it'll look secure.

125
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.910
So this is why we have to
talk about CSRF protection.
