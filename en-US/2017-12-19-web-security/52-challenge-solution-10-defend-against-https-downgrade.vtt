1
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.620
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So
the last exercise we're gonna do

2
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.240
is we're gonna add HSTS
headers to this Equihax app.

3
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.648
And what we can do is try
a couple lvh.me domains and

4
00:00:11.648 --> 00:00:16.590
see what happens on the first visit and
on subsequent visits.

5
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.572
So we're going to solve
the problem of going through

6
00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:24.866
of adding HSTS headers to our app.

7
00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:29.595
And the problem we're solving
is what happens if someone

8
00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:34.140
tries to downgrade our HTTP
connection to plain HTTP.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.637
So I'm just gonna steal from
my slides this example.

10
00:00:39.637 --> 00:00:44.030
Skipping ahead there,
my example header here and

11
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.633
we're just gonna add it
directly to our server index

12
00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:53.198
here
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Same way we were adding

13
00:00:53.198 --> 00:00:54.280
these other headers.

14
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.850
In fact,
I'll just do it in the same place.

15
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.920
Set header, strict transport security,
and the value is this.

16
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.530
And I'm not gonna,
I'll just make it for a short time,

17
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.260
so I don't mess up lvh.me for myself.

18
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.493
All right, so
also what I wanna do is disable this for

19
00:01:20.493 --> 00:01:26.385
the time being.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And

20
00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:31.800
what we should see, we're gonna try to
start our app on a plain HTTP connection.

21
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.700
We gotta change our imports as well.

22
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.588
We're gonna try to start our app
on a plain HTTP connection, and

23
00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:43.776
basically our browser should object and we
wanna see what that objection looks like.

24
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.044
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so let's look down

25
00:01:55.044 --> 00:02:02.917
here and see what's going on.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: DevTools says Aw, Snap.

26
00:02:11.227 --> 00:02:13.339
&gt;&gt; Mike North: The integrity attribute for

27
00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:14.750
that was blocked.

28
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.376
I think we might have
a caching issue here.

29
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.150
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Let me just substitute this

30
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.480
real quick into the SRI header or
the attribute.

31
00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:32.843
&gt;&gt; Mike North: For the JavaScript file,

32
00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:34.258
which is this third one

33
00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.749
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

34
00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:47.624
if we look network response here,
we should see some headers there.

35
00:02:47.624 --> 00:02:54.830
Strict-Transport-Security max-age-6000.

36
00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.127
So I'm actually gonna move the certificate
into place that I already have,

37
00:03:00.127 --> 00:03:04.554
and let's see if we can get that to work.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

38
00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:08.492
if you're watching the video for

39
00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:13.320
the course, you don't have to do this.

40
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.252
We're just doing it right
now to get around something.

41
00:03:23.563 --> 00:03:24.402
&gt;&gt; Mike North: And pro tip,

42
00:03:24.402 --> 00:03:27.457
whenever you're working with certificates,

43
00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:32.125
at the same time you develop the
certificate add them to your getignore.

44
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:38.280
Do not accidentally commit
certificate stuff, that's really bad.

45
00:03:48.822 --> 00:03:49.763
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

46
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:52.780
let's fire it up, see what happens.

47
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.100
Okay, so we're not on HTTPS yet.

48
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.772
Let's see if that switch works now.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

49
00:04:07.772 --> 00:04:10.890
in the chat, there's some guidance.

50
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.509
You needed it to read
the files from the file

51
00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:16.489
system?
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Yeah.

52
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.939
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I see, it need the needs

53
00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:23.426
the files itself, not just the name.

54
00:04:23.426 --> 00:04:24.270
Thank you.

55
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.080
Sorry, it's tough to talk and
type at the same time.

56
00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:32.771
It's tough to talk and
think at the same time.

57
00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.970
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Thank you,

58
00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.255
people in the chat for
letting us press on.

59
00:04:48.085 --> 00:04:51.257
And let's see if this just works with
the certificates that are already in

60
00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:55.175
place.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: [SOUND] Much better.

61
00:04:55.175 --> 00:04:57.810
Okay, so if we say HTTPS local host,

62
00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.010
you'll note that I've got a little
red thing up here saying not secure.

63
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:10.380
So that's telling us that there
are some errors, unfortunately,

64
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.320
you used to be able to click right up here
and see what are those errors all about?

65
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.300
Chrome has since buried them down here.

66
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.210
You have to click View Certificate.

67
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.636
You can see that we've got equifax.lvh.me,

68
00:05:22.636 --> 00:05:27.632
that's the domain self-signed
root certificate.

69
00:05:27.632 --> 00:05:33.980
And there's our metadata here, it's
a little tough to see, but it's there.

70
00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.884
The certificate error we're running
into down here is that the authority is

71
00:05:37.884 --> 00:05:38.438
invalid.

72
00:05:38.438 --> 00:05:40.433
So if we view the certificate,

73
00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:45.058
actually the easy way to do this on a Mac
to trust this one is to open it in.

74
00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:47.830
And I think if you open it in
Safari these days you can do it.

75
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.630
Show the certificate.

76
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.090
Yes, you can say, always trust this
when connecting to local host.

77
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.154
And I can actually modify
the trust settings here.

78
00:06:06.448 --> 00:06:11.170
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Great, so now I've got

79
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:16.630
a secure connection.

80
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:23.125
For Chrome, I'm actually gonna have to,
I believe restart just the browser.

81
00:06:23.125 --> 00:06:27.115
I'm still not happy,

82
00:06:27.115 --> 00:06:36.100
I think now it's unhappy
about the common name.

83
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.590
Let me get out of the Netleaf
version of Chrome,

84
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.486
this is kind of driving us nuts.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

85
00:06:42.486 --> 00:06:47.633
excited about those new debugger tools.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Just

86
00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:53.831
can't use disabled version.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right,

87
00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:58.168
so the objections that Chrome has
now in their security tab, it is,

88
00:06:58.168 --> 00:07:01.531
[SOUND] it's still saying
the authority is invalid.

89
00:07:01.531 --> 00:07:03.870
But it's trusted for local hosts.

90
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.753
So let's try using the domain
that it's designed for

91
00:07:07.753 --> 00:07:12.892
equifax.lvh.me.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay,

92
00:07:12.892 --> 00:07:16.130
so my connection is not private,
that's interesting.

93
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.920
Okay, I see the problem.

94
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.550
Subject alternative name missing.

95
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:25.539
So Chrome had some additional things
that were added in version 58 that

96
00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:30.626
need not just the common name, but
the subject alternative name as well.

97
00:07:30.626 --> 00:07:33.320
We're just gonna switch out
to a different browser.

98
00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:39.720
We'll switch to Firefox and that will not,
no, it's complaining as well.

99
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.940
It's complaining about
local host as it should.

100
00:07:45.137 --> 00:07:46.553
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Nope.

101
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.692
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right.

102
00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:03.810
&gt;&gt; Mike North: All right, we're here.

103
00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.910
Finally, we're in Safari.

104
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:14.312
Let's open up DevTools.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So this is fine, right?

105
00:08:14.312 --> 00:08:17.897
And if I were to try a plain
HTTP connection at this point,

106
00:08:17.897 --> 00:08:20.300
it should be really disappointed me.

107
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:28.661
It kicked me up to HTTPS.
&gt;&gt; Mike North: So

108
00:08:28.661 --> 00:08:33.520
let's try killing the server and
not serving over HTTPS anymore.

109
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:36.985
That's the easiest way to test this out.

110
00:08:53.954 --> 00:08:55.995
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Okay, so
this is what it's telling us.

111
00:08:55.995 --> 00:08:58.185
An SSL error has occurred.

112
00:08:58.185 --> 00:09:02.785
It can't create a secure
connection to equifax.lvh.me.

113
00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:06.570
So let's see if the other browsers,

114
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:11.453
I'm curious now to see if
They will spite having

115
00:09:11.453 --> 00:09:16.354
those errors,
the secure connection failed.

116
00:09:16.354 --> 00:09:23.099
So what we're saying here is,
&gt;&gt; Mike North: I

117
00:09:23.099 --> 00:09:25.140
guess this one didn't pick it up.

118
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.250
So we never successfully loaded it,
and so it's not honoring our stuff,

119
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:32.970
honoring the HSTS orders that we gave it.

120
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:35.925
But in this situation you
basically got Safari saying,

121
00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:40.860
we're disallowed from making a plain issue
DP connection because we've informed this

122
00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.750
particular browser that it is not allowed
to do so in the near future, or for

123
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:46.820
that prescribed amount of time.
