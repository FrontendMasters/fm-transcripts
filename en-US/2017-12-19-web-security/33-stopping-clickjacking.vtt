00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.545
&gt;&gt; Mike North: What hope do we have for
defending against such an attack?

2
00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:07.480
X-Frame options,
it's another HTTP response header.

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.540
What you're doing here is
you're informing the browser,

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.440
when it downloads the document
it doesn't know until it

5
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.990
gets this document what
it's allowed to do or not.

6
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.480
If someone's put it in an I-frame, it
receives this and it's gonna look at these

7
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.410
headers and say, ha, I am not allowed
to put this inside another page.

8
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.440
I'm not allowed to render this as
anything other than the top level frame

9
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.910
within a browser tab.

10
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.239
Or same origin, the second option here,
that would say, well only render

11
00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.325
this as a frame if the top level frame
is always the same origin, right.

12
00:00:41.325 --> 00:00:43.695
This only pertains to the top
level frame by the way.

13
00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:48.413
For anyone who's got, who's unfortunate to
have an app that has an elaborate set of

14
00:00:48.413 --> 00:00:52.010
nested i-frames,
it's the outermost one that matters here.

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.590
Keep in mind that Chrome and Safari
are trying to move towards using a content

16
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.590
security policy driven indicator
called frame-ancestors.

17
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.010
So you would want to use that.

18
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.930
And again we have our sources there.

19
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.790
Just like we could say only allow scripts
from yourself and from this domain.

20
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.960
Similarly you'd say only allow
yourself to be framed within x, y, z.

21
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:24.890
Not all browsers respect this,
older browsers, they predate this.

22
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.550
There is a hack that we can do that
will give us a similar effect.

23
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.130
It's a combination of a style tag and
a little piece of script.

24
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.180
So the style tag, it has an ID on it,
and we're saying don't display the body.

25
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.482
So the difference between visibility none
and display none, just in case anyone

26
00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:48.130
needs to brush up on CSS,
this will take up no space in the dom.

27
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.714
It's not that it's opaque, or sorry, it's
not that it's translucent and still there,

28
00:01:52.714 --> 00:01:54.450
it's as if it's not there at all.

29
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.590
You cannot interact with anything or
see it if it's display none.

30
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.430
And we add !important here.

31
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.120
This is a good use of !important
because we want to supersede

32
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.550
any browser styles that may
exist that apply to the body.

33
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.250
The code on the bottom
basically says as you start up,

34
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.510
compare yourself,
which is self as sort of an alias for

35
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.700
window, think of it that way,
to the top frame.

36
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.520
And you'll be able to access top if you
are being iFramed currently, right.

37
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.840
Sorry, it is there regardless, but it will
be your self if you are also the top.

38
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.500
So if you are the top,
grab this style tag and remove it.

39
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.510
Otherwise we're going to set
the location of the containing frame

40
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.660
equal to our location.

41
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.310
So it's basically saying,
you just i-framed me?

42
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.080
Alright, whatever page you are,
now we're sending you to our domain.

43
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.040
We're basically gonna pop out
of the i-frame and take over.

44
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.780
So this will work in
older browsers as well.
