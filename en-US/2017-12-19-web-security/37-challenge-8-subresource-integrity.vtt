00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.040
&gt;&gt; Mike North: Eighth exercise here,

2
00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.070
we're gonna add subresource integrity
attributes to the script and

3
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.400
styles that we're bringing in for
our material design library.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.400
Now these are not ones that
are hosted on some CDN somewhere.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.260
We're hosting them locally, but

6
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.240
it's good because if we were to deploy
our assets onto a CDN for example,

7
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.820
it's possible that someone might
tamper with those things, right?

8
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.110
It has happened before.

9
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.750
So it's good to add these
integrity attributes to

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.950
any external style sheet or
script that we're bringing in to our app.

11
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.310
And you should be able to see that
if you go in and modify those files,

12
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.250
because they're hosted locally,
we can tweak them.

13
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.970
We can add a new line or something.

14
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.530
And you should see that
the browser basically rejects,

15
00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:47.295
&gt;&gt; Mike North: It does not agree to

16
00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:50.640
handle them and throws an error instead.

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.380
So for ten minutes add
subresource integrity headers.

18
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.261
And that'll be done in your main layout
view in the server views folder.
