00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.220
Welcome to the complete intro to computer
science data structure and algorithms.

2
00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.532
So the first thing you'll see
here on my screen is I had this

3
00:00:09.532 --> 00:00:11.741
nice little course website.

4
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.313
This is all of my notes, so literally, you
can see here I have two computers, one of

5
00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:19.530
them I just have this website off and I'm
just kind of going through point by point.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.528
So this is something that you can keep
after you're done with the course and

7
00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:25.210
refer back to you can share
it with your friends.

8
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.387
One of the really nice things in front of
masters allows me to do is to open source

9
00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:29.460
all the course material.

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.447
So if there's spelling mistakes,
please go in and fix them,

11
00:00:33.447 --> 00:00:38.526
these courses get better as people help,
and it's all open source on Git Hub.

12
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.445
Okay, so let's kind of just orient
you a little bit with this site.

13
00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:47.150
Here you can see we have various
different sections here.

14
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.860
Most of these are pretty self-contained so
if you go do trees and

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.359
you want to do that, you don't necessarily
have to take binary search first,

16
00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:00.449
which is a nice feature that the only
thing I'll say is that the trees and

17
00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.245
applying tree algorithms,
as you might guess,

18
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:07.788
are kind of based on each other,
everything else is pretty self-contained.

19
00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:09.452
You can see here that these are links so

20
00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:11.584
if I click into one of these
Here in the top right,

21
00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:15.790
you'll see that the name of the section
and the name of the lesson that we're on.

22
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.922
So if I'm in the middle of the lesson,
you can kind of see which part of

23
00:01:18.922 --> 00:01:21.846
the website I'm on, so
you can hop back into wherever I am cool.

24
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:29.380
Cool, so let's talk a little bit about
why you might wanna take this course.

25
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.589
You might want to take this course because
you're interested in computer science and

26
00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:35.284
you wanna be a better programmer,

27
00:01:35.284 --> 00:01:39.530
that's kind of where I started
learning about these sorts of things.

28
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.005
These things are also very useful for
interviews because big tech

29
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:46.985
companies love to ask these kind of
questions, for reasons unknown to me,

30
00:01:46.985 --> 00:01:50.523
because most of them don't necessarily
apply on your day to day but

31
00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:53.747
they think it's a measure of
intelligence which I would very

32
00:01:53.747 --> 00:01:56.746
vehement say that it's not
a measure of intelligence.

33
00:01:56.746 --> 00:01:58.954
But in any case, it is the way it is, so

34
00:01:58.954 --> 00:02:03.304
I'm gonna help you cheat at those
interviews by knowing all of the things,

35
00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:06.530
is that cheating by
just knowing the thing?

36
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.129
I guess, no, kind of, anyway, don't care,
I want you to pass all of your interviews

37
00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.846
and get paid lots of somebody
that's my goal here.

38
00:02:16.404 --> 00:02:19.297
Okay, here you'll see I have
these like blue boxes on here,

39
00:02:19.297 --> 00:02:22.701
these are just like points of emphasis,
so whenever you see a blue box,

40
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:25.510
be sure to pay attention
to those on the site.

41
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.945
The first one here is just kind of giving
you permission to feel like this is hard.

42
00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:32.493
[LAUGH] We're about to go
learn a lot of kind of like,

43
00:02:32.493 --> 00:02:39.330
concepts require a lot of brainpower to
just process through, which is exhausting.

44
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.940
So expecting you to do all of these,
right in a row is very, very difficult.

45
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.680
And I'm gonna say for those of you
that are watching this later and

46
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.811
recorded, just give yourself
space to do it, right?

47
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:54.008
Take this over a couple of days,
walk away from the computer,

48
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:58.433
think about it Come back, there's a reason
why the colleges spread this out over like

49
00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:02.650
two years, it's because it's kind
of hard to do this all at once.

50
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.140
So just be aware you have this just like
tidal wave of knowledge coming your way,

51
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.870
and if it feels like you're drowning you
might be a little bit and that's okay.

52
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.810
Right, like that's kind of
how this is supposed to work.

53
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.640
But at the same time, it's just really
good to be exposed to these things and

54
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.840
kind of let them sink in overtime.

55
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.936
Like maybe take this class
a couple of times and

56
00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:24.773
you'll get a little bit more each time.

57
00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:25.854
But in any case,

58
00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:30.809
the number one thing here I'm saying
is do not get down on yourself, right?

59
00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.539
That's really easy to do when
these things seem really hard and

60
00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.890
it feels like everyone else is getting
it and Brian is breezing through this,

61
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.040
why is this so hard for me?

62
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.060
Don't go to that place,
there's nothing useful there for you.

63
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.631
Just be okay, having a hard time,

64
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:49.585
that's really what I wanna get here is
like it's okay to feel like this is hard.

65
00:03:51.957 --> 00:03:55.520
But by the way, I have to like look these
up every single time that I use them.

66
00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.489
I don't just have this like tucked away
in the back of my head, I prepared for

67
00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.155
this course and
spent a bunch of time doing this, so

68
00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:04.778
I don't even have this all
in my head all the ones.

69
00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:06.892
All right, that's enough of that.

70
00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:09.550
So who's this course for?

71
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.265
Hopefully, this course is for
you that's who I wrote it for.

72
00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:17.565
[LAUGH] There is a base level
expectation that you know JavaScript.

73
00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:22.015
In that I'm not going to be teaching
your JavaScript today, hopefully,

74
00:04:22.015 --> 00:04:24.425
you are okay with JavaScript.

75
00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:27.768
If you don't know JavaScript,
front of masters has a lot of great and

76
00:04:27.768 --> 00:04:29.395
even free resources.

77
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:33.054
I link to down here to the boot camp,
which I taught with along with Jen Kramer

78
00:04:33.054 --> 00:04:37.003
and that's totally free for everybody,
definitely share that with your friends

79
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:41.032
as well, and that'll get you up to speed
where you could probably take this class.

80
00:04:41.032 --> 00:04:43.670
I'm not gonna be doing any sort
of advanced JavaScript stuff,

81
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.656
I even took most of the functional
programming stuff out of this class,

82
00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:49.470
so it's actually fairly straightforward.

83
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.349
Or I hope it's straightforward,

84
00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:54.861
that's what I designed it to be
that you can be the judge of that.

85
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.002
Okay, who's this lovely
bastard on the screen?

86
00:05:00.002 --> 00:05:01.606
That's me.

87
00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:05.776
[LAUGH] My name is Brian,
I work at Microsoft, I live in Seattle at

88
00:05:05.776 --> 00:05:11.460
the moment, I've lived there for,
I don't know, four or five years now.

89
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.980
I did attend college,
I did go to a university where I learned

90
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.510
computer science, I actually
ended up dropping out of college.

91
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.017
But I had taken three years
of computer science so

92
00:05:20.017 --> 00:05:22.800
I did take these classes in college.

93
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.421
But I really was always kind of
annoyed that I felt that people felt

94
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:31.624
like that this knowledge of
computer science is locked up in

95
00:05:31.624 --> 00:05:34.749
these $50,000 degrees a semester.

96
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:37.903
Those kind of things and that this was
inaccessible to them because in reality,

97
00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:41.102
most of these concepts, as you'll see,
I can teach you in a couple of hours, and

98
00:05:41.102 --> 00:05:43.924
you'll just know them and you'll have
them for the rest of your life and

99
00:05:43.924 --> 00:05:45.835
you didn't need a four-year
degree to get it.

100
00:05:46.905 --> 00:05:48.724
The other thing I wanna make sure,

101
00:05:48.724 --> 00:05:52.744
I'm not disparaging computer science
degrees either, they are useful and

102
00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:55.720
for people that have them,
high five, I wish I had one.

103
00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.620
[LAUGH] So that's also useful as well but
I wanna make sure that we're not

104
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.911
safekeeping either way, we're not making
people that have CSVS to that, but

105
00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:08.006
we also wanna bring people that don't
have CS degrees with us, right, and

106
00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:09.522
share all this knowledge.

107
00:06:11.432 --> 00:06:14.899
So, that's why I wrote this course because
I really wanted to make sure that you

108
00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:18.085
didn't feel like that knowledge was
locked behind some dollar figure.

109
00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.912
So, yeah, as I started working at larger
and larger companies, thee funny thing is

110
00:06:24.912 --> 00:06:27.600
I used to think that these concepts
were totally worthless, right?

111
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.464
I learned all these things in a vacuum and
I thought like why would my ever

112
00:06:32.464 --> 00:06:37.100
gonna need to know how to do 17
different ways of sorting numbers.

113
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.929
It turns out after working at Netflix and
Reddit and LinkedIn and Microsoft and

114
00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:47.550
all these big companies, these actually
do get used, and they are useful to know.

115
00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.435
But more than anything, it's actually
like the mindset of trading-off,

116
00:06:51.435 --> 00:06:55.208
what am I gonna do this thing and
I'm going to sacrifice this other thing.

117
00:06:55.208 --> 00:06:59.603
That sort of mindset is really
what computer science is to me,

118
00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:02.824
it's just a science of making trade-offs.

119
00:07:02.824 --> 00:07:06.036
I'm gonna use in the word trade-off today,
I don't know if you've ever watched me in

120
00:07:06.036 --> 00:07:07.972
front and happy hour,
if we had a key word today, and

121
00:07:07.972 --> 00:07:10.185
it was trade-off we'd all be
drunk by the end of the class.

122
00:07:11.377 --> 00:07:18.258
If not, you can go listen front and happy
hour that joke will make more sense of do.

123
00:07:18.258 --> 00:07:23.015
All right, yeah, I wanna help you learn
methodologies of structured thinking

124
00:07:23.015 --> 00:07:25.435
that's kind of like my goal here today.

125
00:07:27.594 --> 00:07:28.800
What else?

126
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.822
When I'm not teaching here for
a Masters when I'm not working,

127
00:07:33.822 --> 00:07:37.914
I like to exercise,
I hopped on my peloton too much,

128
00:07:37.914 --> 00:07:42.020
I really like the scotches,
I like very happy beer.

129
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.788
I have an amazing wife Nikki, I like
getting my ass kicked Dota and Overwatch,

130
00:07:46.788 --> 00:07:49.910
as most of the Frontend Masters
team can attest to.

131
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:56.423
And of traveling as well,
I haven't done that in a little while but

132
00:07:56.423 --> 00:07:59.060
that's also something I have loved to do.

133
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:04.009
I have an adorable dog I put a picture
of Luna in literally every course that I

134
00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:05.324
teach, so there she is.

135
00:08:08.238 --> 00:08:10.680
Here's I just dropped some links
to my favorite charities in here.

136
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.350
These are the ones that I support,
there's certainly awesome.

137
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.930
So if you're interested in finding
some cool charity support,

138
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.370
there's a couple on there as well.

139
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:23.526
As always special things to Frontend
Masters, really appreciate them giving

140
00:08:23.526 --> 00:08:28.040
me the opportunity to get up here
to share this knowledge with you.

141
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.440
Yeah, it's, they're awesome people to
work with, thanks for the Masters.

142
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:39.067
As always, I put my socials on here,
you can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn,

143
00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:40.622
GitHub, and peloton.

144
00:08:40.622 --> 00:08:44.838
I do have open DMS on both of them,
I am terrible at answering them, so

145
00:08:44.838 --> 00:08:49.670
just be aware, feel free to send them I
might not respond cuz I get a lot of them.
