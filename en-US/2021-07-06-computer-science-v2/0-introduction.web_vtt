00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.909
Welcome to the complete intro to computer
science, data structure, and algorithms.

2
00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:08.573
My name is Brian Holt, I'm super excited
to be here talking to you all, this is

3
00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:12.750
the, I don't know, 50th time I've been
here, I've really can't count that high.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.172
But suffice to say, for some reason
Frontend Masters keeps inviting me back,

5
00:00:17.172 --> 00:00:20.723
and for some reason I keep making
that joke, I don't know why.

6
00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:23.229
I think it's like time is
a flat circle sort of, anyway,

7
00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.966
no one wants to talk about that with me.

8
00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:31.476
Today we're gonna talk about computer
science, specifically data structure and

9
00:00:31.476 --> 00:00:37.435
algorithms, I'm really excited to be
back here talking to you about that.

10
00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:41.690
So, yeah, let's get into my
background a little bit and

11
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.360
why I'm excited to teach you this.

12
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.469
First of all, I've actually taught what's
called four semesters of computer science

13
00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.702
in five hours, this is actually
the second revision of that course.

14
00:00:51.702 --> 00:00:55.668
We kind of made the title a little
less [LAUGH] clickbatey, and I think

15
00:00:55.668 --> 00:01:00.349
we improved the course, but the material
here is gonna be relatively similar.

16
00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:04.131
The nice thing about computer science
is that it doesn't change very much

17
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:04.864
year to year.

18
00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.590
Most of the things I've been talking to
you about were invented in the 50s, 60s,

19
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.402
70s, so you learn these ones and
you get to know them forever.

20
00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:17.941
Cool, so the first thing
you'll see here on my screen,

21
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:21.212
is I had this nice little course website.

22
00:01:21.212 --> 00:01:24.930
This is all of my notes, so literally, you
can see here I have two computers, one of

23
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.774
them, I just have this website off and I'm
just kind of going through point by point.

24
00:01:28.774 --> 00:01:32.118
So this is something that you can keep
after you're done with the course and

25
00:01:32.118 --> 00:01:34.417
refer back to,
you can share it with your friends.

26
00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:37.359
One of the really nice things in Frontend
Masters allows me to do is to open

27
00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:38.720
source all the course material.

28
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.360
So if there's spelling mistakes,
please go in and fix them,

29
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.984
these courses get better as people help,
and it's all open source on GitHub.

30
00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.412
Okay, so let's kind of just orient
you a little bit with this site here,

31
00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:57.644
you can see we have various
different sections here.

32
00:01:57.644 --> 00:02:01.166
Most of these are pretty self contained,
so if you go to Trees and

33
00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.407
you wanna do that, you don't necessarily
have to take Binary Search first,

34
00:02:05.407 --> 00:02:07.056
which is a nice feature that.

35
00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:11.404
The only thing I'll say is that the Trees
and Applying Tree Algorithms, as you might

36
00:02:11.404 --> 00:02:15.951
guess, are kinda then based on each other,
everything else is pretty self contained.

37
00:02:17.198 --> 00:02:20.312
You can see here that these are links,
so if I click into one of these,

38
00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:23.267
here in the top right, you'll see
that the name of the section and

39
00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:25.010
the name of the lesson that we're on.

40
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.407
So, if I'm in the middle of a lesson,

41
00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:28.302
you can kinda see which
part of the website I'm on.

42
00:02:28.302 --> 00:02:31.394
So if you can hop back into wherever I am.

43
00:02:33.483 --> 00:02:38.715
Cool, so let's talk a little bit about
why you might wanna take this course.

44
00:02:38.715 --> 00:02:43.353
You might wanna take this course because
you're interested in computer science and

45
00:02:43.353 --> 00:02:45.051
wanna be a better programmer,

46
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:48.853
that's kind of where I started
learning about these sort of things.

47
00:02:48.853 --> 00:02:50.666
These things are also very useful for

48
00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:54.481
interviews because big tech companies
love to ask these kinds of questions.

49
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.004
For reasons unknown to me,

50
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.394
cuz most of them don't necessarily
apply on your day to day.

51
00:02:59.394 --> 00:03:02.040
But they think it's
a measure of intelligence,

52
00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.050
which I would very bohemian say that
it's not a measure of intelligence.

53
00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.533
But in any case, it is the way it is, so

54
00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:13.439
I'm gonna help you cheat at those
interviews by knowing all of the things.

55
00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.850
Is that cheating by just
by just knowing the thing?

56
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.490
I guess no kind of, anyway, don't care,
I want you to pass all of your interviews

57
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.341
and get paid lots of money,
that's my goal here.

58
00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:28.367
Okay, here you'll see I have
these blue boxes on here,

59
00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:30.671
these are just points of emphasis.

60
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:34.812
So whenever you see a blue box, be sure
to pay attention to those on the site.

61
00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:38.164
The first one here is just kinda giving
you permission to feel like this is hard.

62
00:03:38.164 --> 00:03:44.228
[LAUGH] We're about to go learn a lot of
kind of concepts require a lot of brain,

63
00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:48.539
power to just process through,
which is exhausting.

64
00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:53.130
So, expecting you to do all of these
right in a row is very difficult.

65
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.025
And I'm just gonna say for those of
you that are watching this later and

66
00:03:57.025 --> 00:04:00.339
read recorded,
just give yourself space to do it, right?

67
00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:05.042
Take this over a couple of days, walk
away from the computer, think about it,

68
00:04:05.042 --> 00:04:05.767
come back.

69
00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:09.150
There's a reason why the college
has spread this out over two years,

70
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.610
it's cuz it's kind of hard
to do this all at once.

71
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.307
So, just be aware you have this just
tidal wave of knowledge coming your way.

72
00:04:16.307 --> 00:04:20.003
And if it feels like you're drowning,
you might be a little bit, and

73
00:04:20.003 --> 00:04:21.297
that's okay, right?

74
00:04:21.297 --> 00:04:22.795
That's kinda how this is supposed to work.

75
00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:27.947
But at the same time, it's just really
good to be exposed to these things and

76
00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:30.294
kind of let them sink in over time.

77
00:04:30.294 --> 00:04:32.265
Maybe take this class
a couple of times and

78
00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:34.187
you'll get a little bit more each time.

79
00:04:34.187 --> 00:04:39.175
But in any case, the number one thing here
I'm saying is do not get down on yourself,

80
00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:39.677
right?

81
00:04:39.677 --> 00:04:42.787
That's really easy to do when
these things seem really hard and

82
00:04:42.787 --> 00:04:44.906
it feels like everyone else is getting it.

83
00:04:44.906 --> 00:04:47.791
Brian's breezing through this,
why is this so hard for me?

84
00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:51.922
Don't go to that place,
there's nothing useful there for you,

85
00:04:51.922 --> 00:04:53.958
just be okay having a hard time.

86
00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:58.542
That's really what I wanna get here,
it's okay to feel this is hard.

87
00:05:01.007 --> 00:05:04.406
By the way, I have to look these
up every time I have to use them,

88
00:05:04.406 --> 00:05:07.501
I don't just have this tucked
away in the back of my head.

89
00:05:07.501 --> 00:05:10.377
I prepared for this course and
spent a bunch of time doing this, so

90
00:05:10.377 --> 00:05:12.532
I don't even have this all
in my head all at once.

91
00:05:12.532 --> 00:05:16.756
All right, it's enough of that.

92
00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:18.976
So who is this course for?

93
00:05:18.976 --> 00:05:21.659
Hopefully this course is for you,
that's who I wrote it for [LAUGH].

94
00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.889
There is a basic expectation
that you know JavaScript,

95
00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:30.479
in that I'm not going to be
teaching your JavaScript today,

96
00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.728
hopefully you're okay with JavaScript.

97
00:05:33.728 --> 00:05:37.372
If you don't know JavaScript,
Frontend Masters has a lot of great and

98
00:05:37.372 --> 00:05:38.557
even free resources.

99
00:05:38.557 --> 00:05:42.205
I linked down here to the boot camp,
which I taught along with Jenn Kramer, and

100
00:05:42.205 --> 00:05:44.640
that's totally free for
everybody, definitely,

101
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.429
share that with your friends as well.

102
00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:50.314
And that'll get you up to speed where
you could probably take this class.

103
00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:52.793
I'm not gonna be doing any sort
of advanced JavaScript stuff,

104
00:05:52.793 --> 00:05:55.619
I even took most of the functional
programming stuff out of this class.

105
00:05:55.619 --> 00:06:00.664
So it's actually fairly straightforward or
I hope it's straightforward,

106
00:06:00.664 --> 00:06:04.939
that's where I designed it to be
that you can be the judge of that.

107
00:06:06.057 --> 00:06:10.640
Okay, who's this lovely
bastard on the screen?

108
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.760
That's me [LAUGH].

109
00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.647
My name is Brian, I work at Microsoft,
I live in Seattle at the moment,

110
00:06:17.647 --> 00:06:20.751
I've lived there for
four or five years now.

111
00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.308
I did attend college,
I did go to a university where I

112
00:06:23.308 --> 00:06:26.926
learned computer science, I actually
ended up dropping out of college.

113
00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:30.380
But I had taken three years
of computer science, so

114
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.881
I did take these classes in college.

115
00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:36.616
But I really was always kind of annoyed
that I felt that people felt that this

116
00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:41.127
knowledge of computer science was locked
up in these $50,000 degrees a semester,

117
00:06:41.127 --> 00:06:44.296
those kind of things, and
that this was inaccessible to them.

118
00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:47.174
Cuz in reality,
most of these concepts, as you'll see,

119
00:06:47.174 --> 00:06:48.952
I can teach you in a couple of hours.

120
00:06:48.952 --> 00:06:53.548
And you'll just know them and you'll
have them for the rest of your life, and

121
00:06:53.548 --> 00:06:56.246
you didn't need a four
year degree to get it.

122
00:06:56.246 --> 00:06:59.752
The other thing I wanna make
sure that as I'm not disparaging

123
00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:02.912
Computer Science degrees either,
they are useful and

124
00:07:02.912 --> 00:07:06.157
for people that have them,
high five, I wish I had one.

125
00:07:06.157 --> 00:07:10.129
[LAUGH] So that's also useful as well,
but I wanna make sure that we're not gate

126
00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.995
keeping either way, we're not making
people that have CS degrees to that.

127
00:07:13.995 --> 00:07:17.428
But we also wanna bring people that
don't have CS degrees with us, right?

128
00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:18.265
And share all this knowledge.

129
00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:23.421
So, that's why I wrote this course,
is I really wanted to make sure

130
00:07:23.421 --> 00:07:29.404
that if you didn't feel that knowledge
was locked behind some dollar figure.

131
00:07:30.893 --> 00:07:34.323
So, yeah, as I started working at large
and larger companies, the funny thing is I

132
00:07:34.323 --> 00:07:37.120
used to think that these concepts
were totally worthless, right?

133
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.272
I learned all these things in a vacuum and
I thought why would my ever

134
00:07:42.272 --> 00:07:47.521
gonna need to know how to do 17
different ways of sorting numbers.

135
00:07:47.521 --> 00:07:52.146
Turns out, after working at Netflix and
Reddit and LinkedIn and Microsoft and

136
00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:56.924
all these big companies, these actually
do get used and they are useful to know.

137
00:07:56.924 --> 00:08:00.713
But more than anything,
it's actually the mindset of trading off,

138
00:08:00.713 --> 00:08:04.844
what I'm gonna do this thing and
I'm going to sacrifice this other thing.

139
00:08:04.844 --> 00:08:08.300
That sort of mindset is really
what computer science is,

140
00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.333
to me it's just the science
of making trade offs.

141
00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:14.287
And I'm gonna be using
the word trade off today.

142
00:08:14.287 --> 00:08:17.686
I don't know if you've ever watched me on
front end happier, if we had a keyword

143
00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:20.659
today and it was trade off,
we'd all be drunk by the end of the class.

144
00:08:20.659 --> 00:08:21.255
If not,

145
00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:27.437
you can go listen to in front of happier
that joke will make more sense to you.

146
00:08:27.437 --> 00:08:32.033
All right, yeah, I wanna help you learn
methodologies of structured thinking,

147
00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.045
that's kind of my goal here today.

148
00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:37.528
What else?

149
00:08:37.528 --> 00:08:41.383
When I'm not teaching
here at Frontend Masters,

150
00:08:41.383 --> 00:08:47.000
when I'm not working, I like to exercise,
I hop on my peloton too much.

151
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.291
I really like scotches,
I like very happy bear,

152
00:08:50.291 --> 00:08:55.115
I have an amazing wife Nikki,
I like getting my ass kicked.

153
00:08:55.115 --> 00:09:01.567
And over watch, as most of
the Frontend Masters team can attest to.

154
00:09:01.567 --> 00:09:06.481
And I like traveling as well,
I haven't done that in a little while, but

155
00:09:06.481 --> 00:09:09.392
that's also something I have loved to do.

156
00:09:09.392 --> 00:09:11.802
I have an adorable dog,
I put a picture of Luna, and

157
00:09:11.802 --> 00:09:14.398
literally every course that I teach,
so there she is.

158
00:09:15.503 --> 00:09:18.430
I just dropped some links to
my favorite charities in here,

159
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.661
these are the ones that I support,
they're certainly awesome.

160
00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:24.475
So if you're interested in finding
some cool charity support,

161
00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:26.048
there's a couple on there as well.

162
00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:31.675
As always, special thanks to
Frontend Masters, I really appreciate them

163
00:09:31.675 --> 00:09:37.234
giving me the opportunity to get up
here to share this knowledge with you.

164
00:09:37.234 --> 00:09:41.195
Yeah, they're awesome people to work with,
thanks Frontend Masters.

165
00:09:43.307 --> 00:09:48.107
As always, I put my socials on here,
you can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn,

166
00:09:48.107 --> 00:09:49.616
GitHub, and Peloton.

167
00:09:49.616 --> 00:09:53.801
I do have open DMs on both of them,
I am terrible at answering them, so

168
00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:58.580
just be aware, feel free to send them, I
might not respond cuz I get a lot of them
