1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.131
Okay, so this does all of A.

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:08.815
And actually, this would probably
eventually end up working.

3
00:00:08.815 --> 00:00:11.730
Because if you have the A will
just continue to spiral out,

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.020
eventually it's gonna find B, but
we want to do it on both sides.

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.430
So we're gonna basically
mirror this logic but for B.

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.890
You might be able to break this into
a function that does it for both.

7
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.750
I didn't, so
I'm actually just gonna copy this.

8
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.622
We're gonna do this same thing for
B neighbors.

9
00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:40.332
So bNeighbors and then we're
gonna have our own little bQueue.

10
00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:47.018
So in here we'll have bQueue.

11
00:00:49.442 --> 00:00:55.220
Okay and then instead of BY_A, this
will be BY_B and this one will be BY_A.

12
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:07.304
And yeah, so you could totally do this
by extracting this into a function and

13
00:01:07.304 --> 00:01:09.513
then just passing it into both.

14
00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.950
That would work.

15
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.283
This is process bNeighbors.

16
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.406
Okay.

17
00:01:29.414 --> 00:01:31.175
I think this should probably work.

18
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:43.798
Maybe it didn't.

19
00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:46.883
But let's check.

20
00:01:50.975 --> 00:01:54.790
So receive negative one and
expected we've six.

21
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.000
Same thing with this one.

22
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.426
So both of these they're coming
back as never finding anything.

23
00:02:03.754 --> 00:02:04.615
Which is not good.

24
00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:05.335
It should.

25
00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:06.321
It should find things.

26
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.616
Thank you that shift aNeighbors,

27
00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:20.822
aNeighbors concat.

28
00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:26.570
So let's console log here.

29
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.180
Well, let's put on our log,
may this function.

30
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.736
So down here,

31
00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:46.964
We're gonna put logMaze(visited) and

32
00:02:46.964 --> 00:02:50.675
also up here, log it as well.

33
00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:56.557
So log maze(visited) lets try that and

34
00:02:56.557 --> 00:03:02.231
we'll try running it again,
see what happens.

35
00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:09.782
All right.
So we're getting, nothing visited.

36
00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:12.751
Okay, so this is not what you want.

37
00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:14.335
We would like to visit things.

38
00:03:19.452 --> 00:03:21.882
So aQueue,
this should have something in it.

39
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.753
So there's probably something wrong
with our get neighbours here.

40
00:03:37.073 --> 00:03:37.573
Check that out.

41
00:03:45.906 --> 00:03:50.679
So it's never coming back with anything.

42
00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.679
Which is problem, okay, so
let's check out why that might be.

43
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.084
Why that might be happening.

44
00:04:06.848 --> 00:04:07.549
Coordinate.

45
00:04:09.997 --> 00:04:11.605
And let's click play.

46
00:04:22.404 --> 00:04:25.010
So that's a thing, got that.

47
00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:31.121
But it doesn't have coordinate that x and
coordinate y.

48
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.837
Y does it not have x and y.

49
00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:34.587
That's y.

50
00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:42.930
So up here in our generate visited maze,
we just need to put x and y in here.

51
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.739
We also need the coordinate to know
exactly what its coordinates are.

52
00:04:47.739 --> 00:04:48.860
Otherwise they won't be able to find that.

53
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.160
So let's try that again.

54
00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.787
And there we go, that was it.

55
00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:04.235
So let's go and
skip the rest of our tests here.

56
00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:12.892
We did six by six we want to do

57
00:05:12.892 --> 00:05:18.444
eight by eight and 15 by 15.

58
00:05:23.185 --> 00:05:26.330
There we go, spiraling out there.

59
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.880
You can see here it's
meeting here at 38 38.

60
00:05:35.065 --> 00:05:37.789
Cool, yeah, I'm happy with the solution.

61
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:43.700
This ended up being a bit more
verbose than what I have in here in my

62
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:44.360
course notes.

63
00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.060
I'll leave both of them so
you can take a look at them.

64
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.062
This one I used without doing any maps or
reduce,

65
00:05:50.062 --> 00:05:53.920
whereas in my other one I used a couple
of maps and a couple reduces as well.

66
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.860
So both are totally valid.

67
00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.559
I'm gonna go ahead and assert that
this might be a little bit clearer,

68
00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.130
just cuz it's easy to read line by line.

69
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.020
Okay, any questions about
our solutions here?

70
00:06:11.591 --> 00:06:12.910
Actually while someone's thinking.

71
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.540
Just one second.

72
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.400
I'll let you ask.

73
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.110
I'm the worst.

74
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.728
I asked too many questions and
I tell you to shut up.

75
00:06:19.728 --> 00:06:23.780
Anyway, so [LAUGH] This was
the bug here on line 32 and 31,

76
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.692
is I forgot to put the x and y.

77
00:06:25.692 --> 00:06:27.555
If you haven't seen that before,
it's x, x.

78
00:06:29.885 --> 00:06:30.940
Y, y right?

79
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.445
But if you just if it's called the same
thing, you can just do that and

80
00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:36.110
we'll put it.

81
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:37.660
Yeah, those two things are equivalent.

82
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.480
But yeah, that was the bug.

83
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.010
You got to put those there.

84
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.640
Okay, sorry.

85
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.010
Go ahead with your question.

86
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:43.407
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
My question was,

87
00:06:43.407 --> 00:06:46.320
it gets to a point that it's so abstract.

88
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.270
It's basically impossible
to solve it even in a day.

89
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.030
So how would you go about
solving a problem like this?

90
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.901
From the very beginning, I guess.

91
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:57.962
&gt;&gt; Yeah, at the beginning of this
course I definitely tried to warn you

92
00:06:57.962 --> 00:07:02.500
that colleges will spread this kinda
stuff out over a couple of years.

93
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.632
And I'm just throwing it all
at you in an afternoon, right?

94
00:07:07.632 --> 00:07:09.745
So one, I am quite sorry.

95
00:07:09.745 --> 00:07:13.649
[LAUGH] This is really difficult
to process all at once.

96
00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.710
Really, for someone taking this course,
I would invite you to give this,

97
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.740
the time that it needs to
kinda sink into your brain.

98
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.159
I probably would try and
do these like, one at a time.

99
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.410
Maybe one a day or something like that.

100
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.658
And the reason why I feel that's fair
to say is it probably took me two or

101
00:07:33.658 --> 00:07:36.041
three months to prepare
all this course material.

102
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.010
And then I'm just expecting
you to learn it all in a day.

103
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.650
And I already knew how to do this stuff,
okay?

104
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.760
So, one, I'm just giving you permission
to feel this is super hard, right?

105
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:52.200
And two, there's really no substitute for
just walking away from the computer.

106
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.110
Taking a walk.

107
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.910
Thinking about it.

108
00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.280
Exercising.

109
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.640
Unwinding, playing with your family,
whatever that means to you.

110
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.820
That's what you need to do.

111
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.169
Because you won't be able to sit down and
do this entire course in one sitting.

112
00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.633
Or you're just about 100
times smarter than I am,

113
00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:11.490
both of which are total possibilities.

114
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:12.960
So, does that help any?

115
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I guess also.

116
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:21.826
Trying to solve it on paper before you
start writing code will be also helpful.

117
00:08:21.826 --> 00:08:25.924
&gt;&gt; For sure, yep.

118
00:08:25.924 --> 00:08:28.011
I mean, this is why when I, in college I,

119
00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:31.970
the first thing I bought when I was very
poor in college was a giant whiteboard.

120
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.440
And that was the most helpful
thing that I had the entire time.

121
00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:38.430
It's just diagramming it out reasoning
through all these kinda things.

122
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:43.699
I'm actually getting a big one installed
in my new office that I just moved into,

123
00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:45.803
it's a whiteboards are great.

124
00:08:45.803 --> 00:08:50.905
But also if you don't have that pen and
paper or Microsoft Visio or Google draw.

125
00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:55.002
Any one of those things can definitely
help you with just putting your very,

126
00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:57.060
very abstract thoughts on the paper.
