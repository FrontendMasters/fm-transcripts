1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.177
Congratulations.

2
00:00:01.177 --> 00:00:06.820
This is one very long very difficult
definitely not one to take lightly course.

3
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.728
There's just a just dump
truck full of knowledge here.

4
00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:15.703
And if you feel you just got
hit in the face with a book,

5
00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:19.500
that's probably because it's
pretty close to that right?

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.239
So what I'm trying to say is don't
expect all of this to sink in.

7
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.440
Some of these concepts you'll probably
never ever think about ever again.

8
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.586
And some of them you might find
yourself thinking about frequently.

9
00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:33.336
One of the most important things though,

10
00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:36.200
here is that you've been
exposed to these things, right?

11
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.949
So now that if you come, to a time much
later where you need something that

12
00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.758
a bloom filter could solve, you might
not be able to remember exactly what

13
00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:47.958
a bloom filter is implemented like or how
to make it work, all that kind of stuff.

14
00:00:47.958 --> 00:00:53.654
But you now you know that there's a data
structure out there is, that you can,

15
00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:59.340
contain a lot of information in one
very small memory footprints right?

16
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.885
And that kind of pattern matching
ability is actually really

17
00:01:02.885 --> 00:01:06.496
what I want you to have to know
that these things are out there,

18
00:01:06.496 --> 00:01:11.446
that you know where to find them, you know
how to Google them, those kind of things.

19
00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:12.911
And more than anything I
really hope that you took

20
00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:14.170
away the science of trading off, right?

21
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.485
The idea of do I have enough CPU?

22
00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:18.642
Do I have enough memory?

23
00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:19.860
Is this code more readable?

24
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.604
Is this code less readable?

25
00:01:22.604 --> 00:01:24.890
Do I always wanna use as
less memory as possible?

26
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.552
Do I always wanna have
the fastest algorithm?

27
00:01:27.552 --> 00:01:30.839
These are all the kinds of
things that I continue to want,

28
00:01:30.839 --> 00:01:35.291
you just need to be thinking about and
hopefully the message that you walk away

29
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:39.557
with is write readable code first,
then worry about performance later.

30
00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:42.630
That's the mantra that I choose
to live by when I'm writing code.

31
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.438
Yeah, spend time trying to solve problems.

32
00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:50.900
Don't try and spend time anticipating
problems that you may never have.

33
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.468
That's in general, generally you wanna
have problems before you solve them

34
00:01:57.468 --> 00:02:00.919
because typically you will not
solve the correct problems.

35
00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:05.127
And only when you need really raw
performance should you really be dropping

36
00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:07.747
down into these really
low level constructs.

37
00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:11.160
But instead, it's just good for
you to know one how things work.

38
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.158
And then if you ever did need to drop down
into these low level constructs that you

39
00:02:14.158 --> 00:02:15.701
know where they are and how to find them.

40
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.538
So thanks for sticking with me.

41
00:02:20.538 --> 00:02:22.200
Hope everyone here enjoyed the course.

42
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.252
And yeah, I'll take any last questions
we have before we wanna sign off.

43
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.960
&gt;&gt; Like you said all about
balance all that stuff.

44
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.247
That's not what's happening for me.

45
00:02:33.247 --> 00:02:36.222
I'd like, I just got invited for
Amazon interview out of the blue.

46
00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:36.920
&gt;&gt; Congrats.

47
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.624
&gt;&gt; Found myself in a predicament,
essentially I build some stuff,

48
00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:41.711
I build websites.

49
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:43.047
But in big companies,

50
00:02:43.047 --> 00:02:48.000
tech interviews are focused on computer
science more than what you build.

51
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.662
And I've been grinding for
ten hours a day solving lead problems.

52
00:02:51.662 --> 00:02:55.130
I guess the question is what
impresses you on the interview?

53
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.385
&gt;&gt; First thing you kinda
just have to know and

54
00:02:57.385 --> 00:03:01.390
embrace is you're not necessarily in
control of your entire interview.

55
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.090
For me, that kinda takes some
pressure off, I don't know it.

56
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.087
For me it just, that helps me realize
that, I can work on the things that I'm

57
00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:13.708
gonna work on and realize that
the other parts are just gonna happen,

58
00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:17.343
however they're gonna happen and
I lack control in that situation.

59
00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:18.180
So that's the first thing.

60
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.214
The second thing is that it's really
gonna depend on who your interview is.

61
00:03:23.214 --> 00:03:25.728
Some of them are just looking for
a checklist, all right,

62
00:03:25.728 --> 00:03:26.764
he found this problem.

63
00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:29.256
She did this, they did that right?

64
00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:32.241
And they're just going
down their checklist.

65
00:03:32.241 --> 00:03:36.230
And so frequently you can kinda tell cuz
they're fishing for specific answers.

66
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.194
In that case, I just asked a lot
of questions of the hem to try and

67
00:03:41.194 --> 00:03:45.990
figure out what they're looking for
and me that helps a lot.

68
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.375
And then for me, I don't know,
there's some interviewers and

69
00:03:49.375 --> 00:03:52.006
I think that are more like me,
which is just like,

70
00:03:52.006 --> 00:03:56.060
actually don't really care if you can,
pathfinding maze, right?

71
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.994
We don't path fine mazes at Microsoft,
right, what I do,

72
00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:05.547
I mean, I guess the Bing Maps
team does but I shut down.

73
00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:10.322
[LAUGH] What I care way more about
is that you communicate that you're

74
00:04:10.322 --> 00:04:14.848
telling me what you're thinking
that you're collaborating,

75
00:04:14.848 --> 00:04:19.896
you're thinking out loud,
you're asking good defining questions.

76
00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:22.610
All right, you're asked me to pathfinding,
this maze.

77
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.983
Can I go out of bounds?

78
00:04:23.983 --> 00:04:27.287
Are there extra walls?

79
00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:28.605
What color's the floor?

80
00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:29.381
I don't know,

81
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:33.940
it's just really defining the problem
space of that you're looking into.

82
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.938
And that's the kind of person that I wanna
work with that's gonna fully understand

83
00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:40.292
a problem and
then devise the correct solution.

84
00:04:40.292 --> 00:04:42.640
So yeah, ask a lot of questions.

85
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.293
Another like really good pro tip with
interviewing with those big tech companies

86
00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:48.600
is if you're having a hard
time solving part of it,

87
00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.623
just make a huge assumption about it and
ask if it's okay, right.

88
00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:56.871
So if you're saying I need to
navigate this in 3D space, can I just

89
00:04:56.871 --> 00:05:02.799
invent a black box function that gives
me the correct coordinates to go to?

90
00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:04.280
I don't know, I'm making stuff up now.

91
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.817
But something like that,
where you just say like,

92
00:05:06.817 --> 00:05:08.890
you cut off a huge portion of the problem.

93
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.974
You make an assumption about it.

94
00:05:09.974 --> 00:05:11.880
It's like, Hey, can I have this function?

95
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.374
A lot of times,
they'll be like, Yeah, sure.

96
00:05:13.374 --> 00:05:14.156
I don't care.
You can.

97
00:05:14.156 --> 00:05:16.308
You can assume that about your code,
right?

98
00:05:16.308 --> 00:05:20.355
Then you don't have to solve problems for
Ray you can kind of work and

99
00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.558
make them work against themselves.

100
00:05:22.558 --> 00:05:25.000
So
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

101
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.295
Just to try to simplify.

102
00:05:27.295 --> 00:05:28.356
Okay.

103
00:05:28.356 --> 00:05:31.740
&gt;&gt; Always ask what metrics are going for
right?

104
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.166
Am I supposed to be going the fastest?

105
00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:35.755
Am I supposed to be
the most clearest thing?

106
00:05:35.755 --> 00:05:38.839
His memory a concern like asking
a bunch of questions like that,

107
00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.249
about what metrics they're
most interested in.

108
00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.805
That's also impressive and useful to you.

109
00:05:44.805 --> 00:05:45.670
So that helps, too.

110
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.077
&gt;&gt; So metrics, and you also mentioned,
consider the cost of algorithms, right?

111
00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:53.807
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; He said I think, Okay?

112
00:05:53.807 --> 00:05:56.079
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a lot of times will ask you like,
what's the big O of this?

113
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.613
I mean, again, I don't talk about bingo
too much when I'm working at Microsoft,

114
00:06:02.613 --> 00:06:06.640
so I don't really care if you can
come up with bingo but lots and

115
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.754
lots of companies do so you should really
drill down into that read up more on and

116
00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:15.109
do some exercises on defining
the big old problem.

117
00:06:15.109 --> 00:06:18.868
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

118
00:06:18.868 --> 00:06:21.310
&gt;&gt; Other questions.

119
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.636
&gt;&gt; I have one in the same vein is
Victor's coming from someone who doesn't

120
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:31.963
have a computer science background
who went to a boot camp primarily for

121
00:06:31.963 --> 00:06:33.854
front end development.

122
00:06:33.854 --> 00:06:38.399
And you have a lot of experience
with the larger companies that,

123
00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:41.106
I'm looking to try to interview for.

124
00:06:41.106 --> 00:06:44.786
Do you have any recommendations or
any advice for

125
00:06:44.786 --> 00:06:49.096
any approaches towards problem practice,
leak code and

126
00:06:49.096 --> 00:06:54.680
whatnot that you find is very
helpful leading into interviews?

127
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.191
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

128
00:06:55.191 --> 00:07:02.190
So when I'm solving a computer science
the problem, what are my kind of my steps?

129
00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.741
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

130
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:08.017
&gt;&gt; I try and reasoned it out in English
first, kind high level steps of,

131
00:07:08.017 --> 00:07:13.654
I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do this, I'm
gonna do this, then I'm gonna return this.

132
00:07:13.654 --> 00:07:17.873
And then at the very least, the whoever's
interviewing knows that you understand

133
00:07:17.873 --> 00:07:21.120
the problem and
knows that you understand the solution.

134
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.545
And then at that point, you're just
in the semantics of syntax, right?

135
00:07:26.545 --> 00:07:29.740
So I found some people have been
really effective with like, cool.

136
00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:30.854
I'm gonna create three functions.

137
00:07:30.854 --> 00:07:35.160
I'm just gonna pseudocode this does this,
this does this, and this does this.

138
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.321
So even if you run out of time, it's
like okay, I was interviewing Shawn and

139
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:41.545
he got through the first two functions.

140
00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:42.937
I didn't finish the third one, but

141
00:07:42.937 --> 00:07:45.980
he obviously got with a third
function was supposed to do.

142
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:48.601
That's I mean, it's not gonna work for
everybody, right?

143
00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:53.354
It depends on what kind of jerk
you're interviewing with, right?

144
00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:56.490
A lot of them will just say,
cool, that's good enough.

145
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:58.454
Obviously he knows what
he's talking about.

146
00:07:58.454 --> 00:08:03.264
Some of them will be like I don't wanna
name and shame the companies too much,

147
00:08:03.264 --> 00:08:06.224
but one of them in particular
is just me like no,

148
00:08:06.224 --> 00:08:09.859
you had to read every semi colon or
I'm not gonna count it.

149
00:08:09.859 --> 00:08:10.926
But your best shot for

150
00:08:10.926 --> 00:08:14.910
sure is making sure that the full solution
Is down however you choose to do that.

151
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.767
My personal style is just to write the
function signatures, the return types and

152
00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:26.070
the kind of high level comment of
this is what this is gonna do.

153
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:30.553
And then I go back and fill it in and
that works well for me to both one,

154
00:08:30.553 --> 00:08:35.130
explain what my intentions are, and
for me to organize my thoughts.

155
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:41.870
Well, thank you friends, please,
do and redo these exercises.

156
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.690
Cuz again, they are difficult.

157
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.580
And the more you do them,
the more they're gonna sink in.

158
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.250
So yeah, thanks for spending some time
with me learning some computer science.

159
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:57.366
If you'd like to let me know on Twitter,
star, the repo on GitHub,

160
00:08:57.366 --> 00:08:58.727
that's always fun too.

161
00:08:58.727 --> 00:09:01.640
And be sure to share this
