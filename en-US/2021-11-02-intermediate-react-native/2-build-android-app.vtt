00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.700
All right, let's build the Android app.

2
00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.150
So for Android development,
we will use Android studio.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.809
So Android studio is the go to integrated
development environment for Android.

4
00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:16.501
They actually also recently had a huge
upgrade to arctic fox, which is this so

5
00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:18.100
they've changed the UI.

6
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.460
So the UI now like when you
launch it looks different.

7
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.698
But all you need to do is we go open.

8
00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:35.471
And we find where our project is, so
mine is in projects mood tracker.

9
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:40.969
And then similarly to what we did in IOS,
just select the folder for Android and

10
00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.070
open it to then you don't need to worry
about which file exactly to open.

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.020
All right, so
just going to load your workspace.

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.197
And notice that I spent quite a lot of
time talking about pods for IOS, but

13
00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:57.930
I didn't talk about anything
related that for Android.

14
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.030
Well, it's because Android dependency
management is done differently.

15
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.720
It's kind of done behind the scenes,
but by the build tool.

16
00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.960
So Android uses gradle for
dependency management.

17
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.331
And if you look at the bottom
right corner here,

18
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:14.290
you can see what would the editors doing.

19
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.403
So when you load the editor,
it's like configuring plugins,

20
00:01:17.403 --> 00:01:19.660
making sure your project is up to date.

21
00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.800
And then when I build it, it actually
downloads the missing plugins and

22
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.772
builds the app.

23
00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:31.530
So for Android,
we're going to use an emulator.

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.760
So emulators you can configure
within Android studio.

25
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.662
So if you click on ADD manager, which is
this little phone with the Android face on

26
00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:43.987
it, and you can choose, if you
haven't got a virtual device already,

27
00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:47.100
you can choose create virtual device.

28
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370
And you can choose the device.

29
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.890
Usually I would choose like
the latest operating system.

30
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.150
But obviously if you test other
operating systems like older versions,

31
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.080
you can create a device specific for that.

32
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.080
Personally, I actually mostly do my
Android development on a physical device.

33
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.060
So I have an Android phone that I use for
testing.

34
00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.960
And I plug it in and

35
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
I find it more convenient than
using the emulators on a Mac.

36
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.288
But in this case,
just because I want a screen share,

37
00:02:14.288 --> 00:02:15.744
I'm going to use a virtual device.

38
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.846
So I'm going to use the pixel five,
so I'm gonna launch it.

39
00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:31.248
Okay.

40
00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.080
Looks like greater list and
all these things.

41
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.210
So I'm going to choose pixel
five from this list of devices.

42
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.902
If you had your own Android device plugged
in, it should appear here on the list and

43
00:02:41.902 --> 00:02:43.607
you can choose that instead.

44
00:02:43.607 --> 00:02:45.450
I'm gonna run the app.

45
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.460
So this will take a little
while to build as well.

46
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.110
So now we have both our IOS app and
our Android app.

47
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.169
I will be looking more into xcode and

48
00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.740
Android studio later on when we
restore native dependencies.

49
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.550
For now,
we let's move on to the next section.
