00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.330 A:middle L:90%
still the same for android. So for android it's

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.419 A:middle L:90%
a little bit different. We only need the image

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.619 A:middle L:90%
icon. So if you've designed your own icon use

4
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.250 A:middle L:90%
that. Otherwise prefer to use the one I created

5
00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:15.759 A:middle L:90%
. So let's save this and I'm just going to

6
00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.289 A:middle L:90%
save it to my downloads directory. All right.

7
00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.420 A:middle L:90%
So on under studio you need to find out Perez

8
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:32.149 A:middle L:90%
mini map, I see launcher. So didn't I

9
00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.710 A:middle L:90%
? So let's go to android studio. So uh

10
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.750 A:middle L:90%
rest men up. I see launcher. Right?

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.250 A:middle L:90%
So notice that we have different sizes launches here.

12
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.909 A:middle L:90%
So when android by default they are images that get

13
00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.939 A:middle L:90%
created. So he wanted to add that. Then

14
00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.549 A:middle L:90%
we go to the res directory and then we right

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.840 A:middle L:90%
click and we do new image assets. And so

16
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.590 A:middle L:90%
here it's just going to give you the previous So

17
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.060 A:middle L:90%
these are so on android, there's plenty more android

18
00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.069 A:middle L:90%
devices to support. There are plenty more versions of

19
00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:18.170 A:middle L:90%
this icon. So firstly we go to the foreground

20
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.400 A:middle L:90%
layer and then from the acid part we choose the

21
00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.629 A:middle L:90%
image we just downloaded. If I go to downloads

22
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.310 A:middle L:90%
and butterflies and openness then for the background layer.

23
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.200 A:middle L:90%
So here on the scaling we can go trim yes

24
00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.870 A:middle L:90%
and then we can size this. So it shows

25
00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:46.239 A:middle L:90%
up as we want all the different icons. Then

26
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.000 A:middle L:90%
on the background layer we can choose a color background

27
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.859 A:middle L:90%
and let's choose the blue that we used for our

28
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.349 A:middle L:90%
app. So in theme let's choose this hex code

29
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.099 A:middle L:90%
and next and finish. So this now has created

30
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.900 A:middle L:90%
. So if we this now has created assets for

31
00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.889 A:middle L:90%
all of these, this now has created the app

32
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.310 A:middle L:90%
icons for all these sizes using our own image.

33
00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:25.960 A:middle L:90%
And now if we rebuild well close everything and rebuild

34
00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.530 A:middle L:90%
it will show up, see if I need to

35
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.150 A:middle L:90%
reset the cache as well. There we go.

36
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.400 A:middle L:90%
Okay, so now on android, once you finish

37
00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.919 A:middle L:90%
the building we can see our new app icon.

38
00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.449 A:middle L:90%
I'm not using the android studio, I'm just using

39
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.389 A:middle L:90%
the command line tool for building android. Do I

40
00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.819 A:middle L:90%
have to install android studio in order to set the

41
00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.449 A:middle L:90%
app icon? Um, so to do this automatically

42
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.719 A:middle L:90%
. Yes. So otherwise, so basically if you

43
00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.110 A:middle L:90%
look at the um, the checkpoint for this,

44
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.909 A:middle L:90%
so if you look at what this tool does,

45
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.780 A:middle L:90%
it creates all of these images automatically based on the

46
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.909 A:middle L:90%
set. So I think there are tools out there

47
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.360 A:middle L:90%
that you can use instead and then just add them

48
00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.189 A:middle L:90%
to the right directories. But that's just like a

49
00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.550 A:middle L:90%
built in way of doing it.
