00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.530
Let's do the same for Android.

2
00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.724
So for Android,
it's a little bit different.

3
00:00:04.724 --> 00:00:06.820
We only need the image icon.

4
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.080
So, if you've designed your own icon,
use that.

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.100
Otherwise, feel free to
use the one I created.

6
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.001
So, let's save this.

7
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:19.907
And I'm just going to save it
to my Downloads directory.

8
00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:22.546
All right, so on Android Studio,

9
00:00:22.546 --> 00:00:27.197
you need to find app -&gt; res
-&gt; mipmap -&gt; ic_launcher.

10
00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:36.318
So, let's go to Android Studio.

11
00:00:36.318 --> 00:00:43.540
So, app, res, mipmap, ic_launcher, right?

12
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.537
So, notice that we have
different sizes launches here.

13
00:00:46.537 --> 00:00:50.450
So on Android by default,
they are images that get created.

14
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.807
So if you wanted to add that,
then we go to the res directory, and

15
00:00:54.807 --> 00:00:56.436
then we right-click.

16
00:00:56.436 --> 00:01:02.444
And we do New, Image Asset.

17
00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:08.593
And here it's just going
to glue the previous.

18
00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:13.561
So on Android there's plenty
more Android devices to support,

19
00:01:13.561 --> 00:01:17.067
there are plenty more
versions of this icon.

20
00:01:17.067 --> 00:01:19.052
So firstly,
we'll go to the foreground layer.

21
00:01:19.052 --> 00:01:26.077
And then, from the Asset Path we
choose the image, we just downloaded.

22
00:01:26.077 --> 00:01:30.496
If I go to Downloads add butterflies,
then I open this.

23
00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:35.214
So, here on the Scaling,

24
00:01:35.214 --> 00:01:39.078
we can go Trim, Yes.

25
00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:41.296
And then we can size this.

26
00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:44.590
So it shows up as we want,
all the different icons.

27
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.672
Then on the background layer,
we can choose a color background,

28
00:01:51.672 --> 00:01:55.897
and let's choose the blue that we used for
our app.

29
00:01:55.897 --> 00:02:00.083
So in theme, let's choose this hex code,

30
00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:06.997
And next and finish.

31
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:15.037
So this now has created the app icons for

32
00:02:15.037 --> 00:02:21.048
all the sizes using our own image.

33
00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:28.000
And now if we rebuild, well,
close everything and rebuild, it'll up.

34
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.950
See if I need to reset the cache as well.

35
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.920
There we go.

36
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.933
Okay, so now on Android once
you've finished rebuilding,

37
00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:36.300
we can see our new app icon.

38
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.171
&gt;&gt; I'm not using the Android Studio,
I'm just using the command line tool for

39
00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:42.240
build-in Android.

40
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.880
Do I have to install Android Studio
in order to set that up app icon?

41
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.361
&gt;&gt; So to do this automatically, yes.

42
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:56.717
So basically,
if you look at the checkpoint for this,

43
00:02:56.717 --> 00:02:59.652
so if you look at what this tool does,

44
00:02:59.652 --> 00:03:04.694
it creates all of these images
automatically based on the set.

45
00:03:04.694 --> 00:03:07.486
So I think there are tools out
there that you can use instead, and

46
00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:09.463
then just add them to
the right directories.

47
00:03:09.463 --> 00:03:11.660
But that's just a built-in
way of doing it.
