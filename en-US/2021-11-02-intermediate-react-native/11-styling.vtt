WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.810 A:middle L:90%
So next we need to display a selected state for

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.209 A:middle L:90%
the mood. So we have this kind of bluish

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.300 A:middle L:90%
background and we need to copy the color for this

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.689 A:middle L:90%
background. So let's do style equals styles dot mood

5
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.679 A:middle L:90%
items and mood item. We'll give this a background

6
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.120 A:middle L:90%
color. Oh this let me just check what I

7
00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:30.269 A:middle L:90%
did. Okay So we'll do height and width of

8
00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:39.850 A:middle L:90%
60. Mhm. Now we want to make it

9
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.429 A:middle L:90%
a circle so we'll do a border radius of 30

10
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.560 A:middle L:90%
. So if you're bored radius is doubled the width

11
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:49.810 A:middle L:90%
or the height, then it makes it a circle

12
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.479 A:middle L:90%
. And let's center the content using justify content center

13
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.439 A:middle L:90%
. Mhm. And align items center. And let's

14
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:13.239 A:middle L:90%
add a border color of white and Mhm. For

15
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.859 A:middle L:90%
the with two. Cool. So now we only

16
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.150 A:middle L:90%
want to show this style for the selected item.

17
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.120 A:middle L:90%
So let's do like moved item for the default styles

18
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:37.739 A:middle L:90%
. And also if the selected mood dot emerge e

19
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.250 A:middle L:90%
. Equals option adult emoji. Then we also apply

20
00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:52.340 A:middle L:90%
styles dot selected. Otherwise we do nothing styles dot

21
00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:01.099 A:middle L:90%
selected mood item and we add a selective mood item

22
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:09.039 A:middle L:90%
style here and we copy the background color so we

23
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.169 A:middle L:90%
want all of them to be space the same way

24
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.650 A:middle L:90%
. But we want only the selected one to have

25
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:22.240 A:middle L:90%
background color. Okay And also the border color and

26
00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:30.590 A:middle L:90%
the border. Cool. So now only the items

27
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.520 A:middle L:90%
that we actually select are highlighted. And finally we

28
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.189 A:middle L:90%
also want to display the text underneath. So let's

29
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.719 A:middle L:90%
wrap this in a view and use a text.

30
00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:56.039 A:middle L:90%
Yeah, that's two option. Description. Alright.

31
00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:58.439 A:middle L:90%
And then let's only display it for the selected items

32
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:13.840 A:middle L:90%
. So if if option dot emoji equals selected mood

33
00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:17.060 A:middle L:90%
. I thought the movie then we display the description

34
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.009 A:middle L:90%
otherwise on the fight. Now we need to add

35
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.599 A:middle L:90%
a style to this. So a stew style styles

36
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.610 A:middle L:90%
dot emoji description text. Let's create a style cold

37
00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:45.319 A:middle L:90%
description text and we'll use the scale Asus to color

38
00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.449 A:middle L:90%
so the same color as the background and we'll do

39
00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:08.050 A:middle L:90%
fun to wait fold text align center. Let's reduce

40
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.020 A:middle L:90%
the font size. So let's do fun size 10

41
00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.259 A:middle L:90%
so now we can select these options and they actually

42
00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:20.579 A:middle L:90%
become highlighted when we select them. Next up let's

43
00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.000 A:middle L:90%
do some styling. So um one of the down

44
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.819 A:middle L:90%
spot, one of the pros and the cons of

45
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.860 A:middle L:90%
styling in react native is that we use in line

46
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.610 A:middle L:90%
styles because we used in lifestyles, we can't do

47
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.339 A:middle L:90%
things that we wouldn't CSS where we create global class

48
00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:36.250 A:middle L:90%
names are kind of reusable styles. So what I

49
00:04:36.329 --> 00:04:39.089 A:middle L:90%
usually do is create a theme file and then in

50
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.490 A:middle L:90%
the steam file I would put all the the all

51
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.939 A:middle L:90%
the constants that could be shared throughout europe. So

52
00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.430 A:middle L:90%
in a source directory, let's create a new file

53
00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:49.899 A:middle L:90%
and let's call it theme dot T. S.

54
00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.430 A:middle L:90%
And in here I'm going to just copy the two

55
00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.279 A:middle L:90%
color constants that were already using. So usually if

56
00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.459 A:middle L:90%
you if you were using this on a real app

57
00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:03.790 A:middle L:90%
, you would also add things like fonts or spacing

58
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.129 A:middle L:90%
in here as far as the colors. So my

59
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.449 A:middle L:90%
convention actually where I like to use that if I

60
00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:11.959 A:middle L:90%
use it for spacing I would do things like space

61
00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:19.139 A:middle L:90%
10 for 10 and then space 12 for 12 et

62
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.540 A:middle L:90%
cetera. And this is quite handy because you'll know

63
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:23.949 A:middle L:90%
exactly all the spaces that are used throughout your application

64
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.459 A:middle L:90%
. And also Using like the number point number represents

65
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.720 A:middle L:90%
the number in the name, ensures that you won't

66
00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.980 A:middle L:90%
have things like oh this was medium and then this

67
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:38.439 A:middle L:90%
is large and then if you get 11 you have

68
00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.069 A:middle L:90%
to call it medium large but we're just going to

69
00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:46.370 A:middle L:90%
be using it for colors for now. Now next

70
00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.240 A:middle L:90%
time you want to do is basically create this layout

71
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.649 A:middle L:90%
where you have a box around your emoji, you

72
00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:58.329 A:middle L:90%
have a prompt text to ask you to select an

73
00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:04.439 A:middle L:90%
emergency and there's a choose button that doesn't actually do

74
00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.660 A:middle L:90%
anything at the moment but we're just going to start

75
00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:09.750 A:middle L:90%
like this, is it better to use margin or

76
00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:14.120 A:middle L:90%
a reusable space or components? It it depends I

77
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.610 A:middle L:90%
think in a lot of places like margin makes more

78
00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.660 A:middle L:90%
sense. Like for example like spacing around this,

79
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.529 A:middle L:90%
margin would make more sense. But for example if

80
00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:27.000 A:middle L:90%
you're if you add spacing like horizontally between elements,

81
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.240 A:middle L:90%
actually spacing component is super nice because it keeps your

82
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.230 A:middle L:90%
Js extra clean um because because basically you'll know exactly

83
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.870 A:middle L:90%
where the spacing is, you don't have to worry

84
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.629 A:middle L:90%
about Oh was it bottom spacing or top spacing?

85
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.110 A:middle L:90%
Um Yeah, I used the space of component.

86
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.300 A:middle L:90%
Alright, so for styling, we're going to create

87
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.230 A:middle L:90%
this little box that has a prompt for how are

88
00:06:47.329 --> 00:06:49.360 A:middle L:90%
you right now and a button to choose the emerging

89
00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:52.519 A:middle L:90%
. So for a challenge, try to implement this

90
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.180 A:middle L:90%
just using a design. So I'm going to use

91
00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:05.540 A:middle L:90%
the checkpoint to copy the whole file. Yeah.

92
00:07:12.139 --> %!s(<nil>) A:middle L:90%
Perfect.
