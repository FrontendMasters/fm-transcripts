00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.919 A:middle L:90%
next up let's look at adding app icons. So

2
00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.290 A:middle L:90%
an upgrade con is basically a unique, unique image

3
00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.500 A:middle L:90%
that's added to your mobile applications is displayed on the

4
00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.849 A:middle L:90%
app store and on the home screen and they should

5
00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.300 A:middle L:90%
be as simple as possible, usually contain no text

6
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.829 A:middle L:90%
so they should look good as possible even when they're

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.870 A:middle L:90%
super small. So you can design your own icon

8
00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.120 A:middle L:90%
using sigma or sketch or anything else for IOS.

9
00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.239 A:middle L:90%
It needs to be 10, 24 by 2024 and

10
00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:29.949 A:middle L:90%
then you basically use that to create the icon.

11
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.500 A:middle L:90%
So in the initial speed, I've already created an

12
00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:36.490 A:middle L:90%
app icon for us. It's this lovely uh butterfly

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.079 A:middle L:90%
picture. Now if you open X code and you

14
00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:47.109 A:middle L:90%
go to mood tracker and images you'll see that we

15
00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:50.509 A:middle L:90%
already have a place here for the app icon and

16
00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:53.130 A:middle L:90%
this actually tells you all the resolutions that it needs

17
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.509 A:middle L:90%
and well this will be quite tedious to for you

18
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.420 A:middle L:90%
to create. So there are plenty of tools out

19
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.850 A:middle L:90%
there that help you create them. The tool that

20
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.400 A:middle L:90%
I use usually is called icon Isar which is basically

21
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.420 A:middle L:90%
um you can download this and install it and then

22
00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.290 A:middle L:90%
this will create the icon sets for various IOS applications

23
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.700 A:middle L:90%
but in order to speed again, I have already

24
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.340 A:middle L:90%
created this for you so you can use the one

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.900 A:middle L:90%
I did. So now if you are open Ri

26
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:30.340 A:middle L:90%
concept Yeah then double click to expand it. Uh

27
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.659 A:middle L:90%
This was created using the icon Isar app that I

28
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.260 A:middle L:90%
showed earlier and it has all the different resolutions that

29
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.810 A:middle L:90%
you might need. Now you can drag and drop

30
00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.030 A:middle L:90%
them into the road boxes. But actually what you

31
00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.439 A:middle L:90%
can do is if you delete, add this if

32
00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.189 A:middle L:90%
you select and click on the minus and then in

33
00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.099 A:middle L:90%
your finder if used drag and drop the whole concept

34
00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.930 A:middle L:90%
in here. It auto populates, save you some

35
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.450 A:middle L:90%
time now if we click on the top level mood

36
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.229 A:middle L:90%
tracker here uh and you're on the general tab,

37
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.780 A:middle L:90%
this lets you edit all kinds of app information.

38
00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:14.870 A:middle L:90%
For example, the device orientation, you can go

39
00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:17.050 A:middle L:90%
portrait or you can say which ones you support.

40
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.099 A:middle L:90%
So for example by default, if you turn your

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.599 A:middle L:90%
phone left or right um like the UI will adapt

42
00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:26.639 A:middle L:90%
but you can disable these if you wanted to does

43
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.500 A:middle L:90%
this from here and here we can also choose our

44
00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:41.490 A:middle L:90%
app icon um mm uh there we go. So

45
00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.099 A:middle L:90%
it hadn't, it just hadn't loaded it yet.

46
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.819 A:middle L:90%
So if we had multiple app icons, eat all

47
00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.430 A:middle L:90%
of them would show up here and you can choose

48
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:57.969 A:middle L:90%
the right one. And finally for IOS I would

49
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.030 A:middle L:90%
close the simulator completely. So you quit it and

50
00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:07.419 A:middle L:90%
then rebuild from x code to get the new app

51
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.919 A:middle L:90%
icon. All right, that was really quick,

52
00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.409 A:middle L:90%
interestingly. So we get the icon here uh but

53
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.560 A:middle L:90%
not on here. So let me just understood it

54
00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:34.090 A:middle L:90%
and close this. So due to performance reasons they

55
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.210 A:middle L:90%
get quite aggressively cached. Um but it's definitely works

56
00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.870 A:middle L:90%
because you could see it in the little on top

57
00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.620 A:middle L:90%
of the application, so if you close the simulator

58
00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:48.069 A:middle L:90%
reopen clear cache, it will eventually show up.

59
00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.169 A:middle L:90%
There we go. Here. It is. So

60
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.669 A:middle L:90%
now we got our beautiful icon. And one thing

61
00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:58.219 A:middle L:90%
I think I forgot to do is that here you

62
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.889 A:middle L:90%
can also change the display name. So by default

63
00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.900 A:middle L:90%
, it's whatever app name you created your apples.

64
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.039 A:middle L:90%
But for example, I could change it to mood

65
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:07.930 A:middle L:90%
and then this will change the mood as well.

66
%!s(<nil>) --> %!s(<nil>) A:middle L:90%
