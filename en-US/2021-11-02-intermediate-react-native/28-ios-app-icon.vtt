00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.603
Next up let's look at adding app icons so

2
00:00:02.603 --> 00:00:07.553
an icon is basically a unique image that's
added to every mobile applications is

3
00:00:07.553 --> 00:00:10.633
displayed on the App Store and
on the home screen.

4
00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:14.555
And they should be as simple as
possible and usually contain no text so

5
00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:18.490
they should look good as possible,
even when they're super small.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.849
So you can design your own icon using
figma or sketch or anything else.

7
00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.546
For iOS it needs to be 1024 by 2024 and

8
00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:31.449
then you basically use
that to create the icon.

9
00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.135
So in initial speed already
created an app icon for

10
00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:38.218
us it's this lovely butterfly picture.

11
00:00:38.218 --> 00:00:42.470
Now if you open Xcode and
you go to mood tracker and

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.591
images you'll see that we already have
a place here for the app icon and

13
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:53.797
this actually tells you all
the resolutions that it needs.

14
00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:58.890
And well this will be quite tedious to for
you to create so there are plenty

15
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.899
of tools out there that help you create
them the tool that I use usually is

16
00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.107
called Iconizer which is basically
you can download this and install it.

17
00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:14.106
And then this will create the icon
sets for various iOS applications but

18
00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:19.785
in your speed again I have already created
this for you so you can use the one I did.

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.150
Now if we open our icon sets,
Then double click to expand it,

20
00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.866
This was created using the iconizer
app that I showed earlier and

21
00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:36.890
it has all the different
Resolutions that you might need.

22
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.732
Now you can drag and
drop them into the right boxes but

23
00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:46.481
actually what you can do
is if you delete this.

24
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:50.056
If you select and click on the minus and

25
00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:56.540
then in your finder if you drag and
drop, the whole icon set.

26
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.440
In here, it auto populates.

27
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.504
Saves you some time.

28
00:02:01.386 --> 00:02:09.020
Now if we click on the top level, mood
tracker here and you on a general tab.

29
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.750
This lets you edit all
kinds of app information.

30
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.730
For example, the device orientation,
you can go portrait or

31
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.610
you can say which ones you support.

32
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.650
So for example, by default,
if you turn your phone left or right.

33
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.445
Like the UI will adapt, but you can
disable these, if you wanted to, but

34
00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:27.555
does this from here.

35
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:33.819
And here we can also choose our app icon.

36
00:02:40.942 --> 00:02:42.188
There we go.

37
00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:43.820
So, it just hadn't loaded it yet.

38
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.470
So, if we had multiple app icons Most
all of them will show up here and

39
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.086
you can choose the right one,

40
00:02:55.628 --> 00:03:00.700
And finally, for iOS,
I would close the simulator completely.

41
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.861
So you quit it, and then rebuild
from Xcode to get the new app icon.

42
00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:15.870
All right, that was really quick,
interestingly.

43
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.420
So we get the icon here, but not on here.

44
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.970
So let me just uninstall it and
close this.

45
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.630
So due to performance reasons they
get quite aggressively cached.

46
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.884
But it's definitely worked because you
can see it's in the little on top of

47
00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:42.740
the application.

48
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.262
So if you close the simulator reopen
clear cache, it will eventually show up.

49
00:03:51.622 --> 00:03:52.450
There we go.

50
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.310
Here it is.

51
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.340
So now we got our beautiful icon.

52
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.228
And one thing I think I forgot to
do is that here you can also change

53
00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:00.560
the display name.

54
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.778
So by default, it's whatever app
name you created your app as.

55
00:04:03.778 --> 00:04:06.085
But for example,
I could change it to mood and

56
00:04:06.085 --> 00:04:08.100
then this will change the mood as well.
