00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.669 A:middle L:90%
when in doubt with these errors refresh because hot reloading

2
00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:06.540 A:middle L:90%
and native modules don't always mix. Mix well.

3
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.789 A:middle L:90%
Um cool. So we have got a home icon

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.910 A:middle L:90%
here but obviously it's way too big and it's a

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.129 A:middle L:90%
weird color. So human, they're here from tab

6
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.140 A:middle L:90%
icon, we have access to what color we should

7
00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:22.589 A:middle L:90%
use and what size so we can actually pass these

8
00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.460 A:middle L:90%
through. So let's do color and we should probably

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.129 A:middle L:90%
d structure them. So color and size. Who

10
00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:38.600 A:middle L:90%
passed in color and size. So now when we

11
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.570 A:middle L:90%
move between the tab, it actually noticed that it

12
00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.479 A:middle L:90%
has an active and inactive state. So this is

13
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.789 A:middle L:90%
what comes from the color. So when I go

14
00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:49.049 A:middle L:90%
to home it's blue and if I go away from

15
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.479 A:middle L:90%
home it's great. She's pretty handy. Now let's

16
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.950 A:middle L:90%
do the same. So for the exercise basically we're

17
00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.500 A:middle L:90%
going to do the same with the other two icons

18
00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.989 A:middle L:90%
. History and analytics. So to do this,

19
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.980 A:middle L:90%
let's copy. So this is the list. So

20
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.060 A:middle L:90%
this is where the history tab as Communist spg and

21
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:15.810 A:middle L:90%
then go to our icons. Let's create a const

22
00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:27.040 A:middle L:90%
history tab and react Fc same icon props because they're

23
00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:29.040 A:middle L:90%
in the same file is actually quite handy to have

24
00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.109 A:middle L:90%
the same props as well use for all of them

25
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.780 A:middle L:90%
. So we know what to expect and that's return

26
00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:50.040 A:middle L:90%
this spG. So we want the same default values

27
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.530 A:middle L:90%
as well. Right now we need to convert these

28
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.269 A:middle L:90%
so we already have SPG imported and we would have

29
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.459 A:middle L:90%
path imported then circle is a new one but it

30
00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:03.120 A:middle L:90%
is a valid SVG element. So all we need

31
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.439 A:middle L:90%
to do is imported from react native SVG. Yeah

32
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.659 A:middle L:90%
. Mhm And the last thing you want to do

33
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.750 A:middle L:90%
is also passing the size and the color so we'll

34
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.550 A:middle L:90%
do on the S P G. We'll do with

35
00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:31.740 A:middle L:90%
it size, height, size and color collapse.

36
00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.719 A:middle L:90%
Of course call it history to have. For some

37
00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.590 A:middle L:90%
reason I'm in history icon and export this as well

38
00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.340 A:middle L:90%
. And let's do the same for the analytics icon

39
00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.830 A:middle L:90%
. So export const and then the ticks I can't

40
00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:15.539 A:middle L:90%
Yeah. See icon pops a little bit turn this

41
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.919 A:middle L:90%
spg so the students same defenses before S. P

42
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.240 A:middle L:90%
. D. And capital as a path and we'll

43
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:36.939 A:middle L:90%
also pass in whip size and height size and of

44
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.449 A:middle L:90%
course the color. Mhm. Now who go back

45
00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.210 A:middle L:90%
to the bottom tabs in our type icon we can

46
00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:53.340 A:middle L:90%
add the rest. So if roots name is history

47
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:04.210 A:middle L:90%
. That's a return mr B icon. Some reason

48
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.939 A:middle L:90%
TypeScript isn't catching up so let's import it manually and

49
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:26.939 A:middle L:90%
if route dot name yes, analytics let's return the

50
00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:40.160 A:middle L:90%
analytics icon. Okay. And because it's such good

51
00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.649 A:middle L:90%
we need to have it's good to have a default

52
00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.639 A:middle L:90%
here. So let's just do return null. If

53
00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:49.930 A:middle L:90%
none of these if for example you added a new

54
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.500 A:middle L:90%
tab. Cool. Let me just reload this.

55
00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.209 A:middle L:90%
Yeah. So in the history I can't we use

56
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.759 A:middle L:90%
fill for the color rather than fill so if we

57
00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.079 A:middle L:90%
change this to fill and change this to fill.

58
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.360 A:middle L:90%
Uh it works Excellent. So now we have three

59
00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.209 A:middle L:90%
tabs and all the work and they change color.

60
00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.699 A:middle L:90%
So these are like the default color. So you

61
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.980 A:middle L:90%
get direct navigation but obviously you can customize this and

62
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.889 A:middle L:90%
use your own colors. So let's go to screen

63
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.740 A:middle L:90%
options. So I added some default colors for us

64
00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.759 A:middle L:90%
to use. Yes, I added two new colors

65
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.129 A:middle L:90%
to our to add to our theme. So we

66
00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.490 A:middle L:90%
got a blue and gray. So if we open

67
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.639 A:middle L:90%
our theme, you can add these two colors here

68
00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.949 A:middle L:90%
and going back to bottom tabs to hear just before

69
00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:01.160 A:middle L:90%
screen options. So it's part of this object.

70
00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.439 A:middle L:90%
We'll do tab bar. Mhm. Active color.

71
00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.589 A:middle L:90%
Active tint color. It's very memorable. It's too

72
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:20.970 A:middle L:90%
theme dot um I think it was blue and then

73
00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:28.610 A:middle L:90%
tab bar inactive tint color will be the other color

74
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:37.189 A:middle L:90%
we added just great color. Great. And this

75
00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.110 A:middle L:90%
is handy because now this is set at the screen

76
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.069 A:middle L:90%
option level. So we don't need to worry about

77
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.439 A:middle L:90%
what color it is. We know it comes,

78
00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:48.819 A:middle L:90%
gets passed into this function. And the last thing

79
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.819 A:middle L:90%
we want to do is we don't actually want to

80
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.160 A:middle L:90%
show the names of these tabs because we have the

81
00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:57.939 A:middle L:90%
icons and they are handy enough. So we have

82
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.259 A:middle L:90%
a property which I think is called tap pass show

83
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.439 A:middle L:90%
label and we set this to false. Then the

84
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.319 A:middle L:90%
label will disappear. And the last thing we want

85
00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.800 A:middle L:90%
to do is we so by default these tab titles

86
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.209 A:middle L:90%
, they will be whatever the tab itself is called

87
00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.180 A:middle L:90%
. So we could update these titles to either display

88
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.699 A:middle L:90%
something that you pass into the screen as a property

89
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.600 A:middle L:90%
or like another hard coded value that's different from the

90
00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.000 A:middle L:90%
actual name of the tab. And the way you

91
00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:29.649 A:middle L:90%
do that is each of the screens also have an

92
00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:34.860 A:middle L:90%
options property. So we've got options and this can

93
00:07:35.019 --> 00:07:37.379 A:middle L:90%
either be a function. Then you get some metadata

94
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:40.310 A:middle L:90%
about the roots and navigation or in our case we

95
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.149 A:middle L:90%
don't care about that. We just want an object

96
00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:58.860 A:middle L:90%
and school title today's mood. Now you can see

97
00:07:59.189 --> 00:08:02.110 A:middle L:90%
it hot updates and it shows up here and we

98
00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:05.579 A:middle L:90%
can do the same for history. So we go

99
00:08:05.689 --> 00:08:14.240 A:middle L:90%
into history. Let's do options and title past minutes

100
00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:22.040 A:middle L:90%
. And for the analytics let's do options, title

101
00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:25.439 A:middle L:90%
, fancy breaths.
