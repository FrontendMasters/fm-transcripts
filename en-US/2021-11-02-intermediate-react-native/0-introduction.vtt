Hi there and welcome to this intermediate react native course

2
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:06.940 A:middle L:90%
. So in this course we are going to use

3
00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.699 A:middle L:90%
this course website that you can access and basically the

4
00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.330 A:middle L:90%
course materials are available from here. Um so you

5
00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.199 A:middle L:90%
can follow along and you can also reference things.

6
00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.039 A:middle L:90%
Um, if you miss what I was typing,

7
00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.160 A:middle L:90%
you can use light or dark mode. So I'm

8
00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.079 A:middle L:90%
going to go for dark mode just to match all

9
00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.539 A:middle L:90%
my editors. And if we go to course,

10
00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:27.510 A:middle L:90%
so we got a course structure here. And basically

11
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.170 A:middle L:90%
the format will be, I'm going to go through

12
00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.429 A:middle L:90%
this course page and we're going to build a react

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.450 A:middle L:90%
native app together. So my name is Kati Kremlin

14
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.820 A:middle L:90%
. I am a principal engineer at formidable and I

15
00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.090 A:middle L:90%
mostly build things using JavaScript So these days I mostly

16
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.200 A:middle L:90%
used react native and graph gail. I've been doing

17
00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.250 A:middle L:90%
web development in react since 2015 and react native since

18
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.369 A:middle L:90%
2017. And I've been super fortunate to have been

19
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.490 A:middle L:90%
involved in several exciting into and react native projects over

20
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.270 A:middle L:90%
the years and I'm really excited to share some of

21
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.939 A:middle L:90%
the things I've learned along the way. So this

22
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.879 A:middle L:90%
course is going to be an intermediate react native course

23
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.090 A:middle L:90%
. So it's going to expect you to know the

24
00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.859 A:middle L:90%
basics already in particular. You should already be familiar

25
00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.290 A:middle L:90%
with Vue text, touchable opacity, flat list and

26
00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.650 A:middle L:90%
scroll view. You should already know how to style

27
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.140 A:middle L:90%
your components using style sheets and you should have an

28
00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:23.859 A:middle L:90%
idea on how to use stack navigator in react navigation

29
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.560 A:middle L:90%
. We also expect you to be able to use

30
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.069 A:middle L:90%
the basic react hooks. so the U. S

31
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.230 A:middle L:90%
. State use effect and use callback in this course

32
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.290 A:middle L:90%
we are not going to be used. Expert will

33
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.719 A:middle L:90%
use plain react native. That means we're going fully

34
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.430 A:middle L:90%
native and you need to build the actual app on

35
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:44.890 A:middle L:90%
your device. That means if you want to build

36
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.700 A:middle L:90%
an IOS app, you will also need to use

37
00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.069 A:middle L:90%
a Mac device Aside from that restriction, please feel

38
00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.459 A:middle L:90%
free to follow along with android or IOS or of

39
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.349 A:middle L:90%
course both. I myself will be using this code

40
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.319 A:middle L:90%
for my code editor and iphone 12 simulator and an

41
00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:05.599 A:middle L:90%
android pixel five emulated throughout throughout the course. Usually

42
00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.599 A:middle L:90%
at the end of the page but sometimes in the

43
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.159 A:middle L:90%
middle you'll see these blue balance and this is basically

44
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.069 A:middle L:90%
a link to a commit for the demo app that

45
00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.270 A:middle L:90%
we're going to be building. So if you want

46
00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:17.680 A:middle L:90%
to check your work or you want to make sure

47
00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:20.039 A:middle L:90%
that you're in the right place. Just reference these

48
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.139 A:middle L:90%
commits and you'll see the actual code that's used in

49
00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.289 A:middle L:90%
the demos. Now look at what we're going to

50
00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.840 A:middle L:90%
be building. We are basically going to be building

51
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.289 A:middle L:90%
this mood app so you can record your mood throughout

52
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.120 A:middle L:90%
the day. So we have a list of emojis

53
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.039 A:middle L:90%
where you can pick our moods notice we have a

54
00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.169 A:middle L:90%
little animation on the button, then we have a

55
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.219 A:middle L:90%
tab layout with the history tabs so we can look

56
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.610 A:middle L:90%
at past moods in our history. We can delete

57
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.490 A:middle L:90%
the moods from from the list. And also we

58
00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.090 A:middle L:90%
have implemented, we will implement the swipe to delete

59
00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.539 A:middle L:90%
. And on the last time we have a little

60
00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:03.849 A:middle L:90%
pie chart for the ratio of moves that we're going

61
00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.159 A:middle L:90%
to be using. Let's start by creating a new

62
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.750 A:middle L:90%
project. So let's open the terminal and we want

63
00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:16.610 A:middle L:90%
to copy this MPX command. So this is a

64
00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:19.319 A:middle L:90%
wreck native in IT commands that will create an app

65
00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.699 A:middle L:90%
called mood tracker and it's using the react native TypeScript

66
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.960 A:middle L:90%
template. Yeah. Yeah. So this is going

67
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.360 A:middle L:90%
to take a little while because what it does is

68
00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.750 A:middle L:90%
it downloads the template then it does yarn install to

69
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.240 A:middle L:90%
install all your JavaScript dependencies. And then it also

70
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.199 A:middle L:90%
does pod install to install all the IOS dependencies if

71
00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.960 A:middle L:90%
you're building on a Mac. So this is why

72
00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.219 A:middle L:90%
it takes a little while for this command to run

73
00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.050 A:middle L:90%
. So I already have my tracker in this directory

74
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.539 A:middle L:90%
so I'm going to delete it and run this again

75
00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:59.740 A:middle L:90%
. Okay, we're done. Okay? So whenever

76
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.639 A:middle L:90%
you start in your project and this is something I

77
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.680 A:middle L:90%
always do. So even if you're not sharing it

78
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.870 A:middle L:90%
with anyone, even if it's just for yourself or

79
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.150 A:middle L:90%
just like a demo thing that you're trying out,

80
00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.909 A:middle L:90%
still make it into a Git repository. So you

81
00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.620 A:middle L:90%
just get in it, get at everything and get

82
00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:26.800 A:middle L:90%
commit. Sure, commit and the reason I always

83
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.420 A:middle L:90%
do that. Is that anything that I add later

84
00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.449 A:middle L:90%
? I will always know exactly what I've added because

85
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.329 A:middle L:90%
you can look at the git diff and whenever you

86
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.170 A:middle L:90%
get to a point where things are working, just

87
00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:38.500 A:middle L:90%
commit it because if you in the future you add

88
00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:42.360 A:middle L:90%
something and you know it happens a lot in react

89
00:04:42.579 --> 00:04:45.850 A:middle L:90%
native because if you mess with the native dependencies on

90
00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.730 A:middle L:90%
X code or under a studio you change something,

91
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.379 A:middle L:90%
you don't know where it changed it. It's just

92
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.230 A:middle L:90%
good to have a state to get back to.

93
00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:57.079 A:middle L:90%
So always do this. All right. So let's

94
00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.490 A:middle L:90%
now open this in X code. So come on

95
00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.649 A:middle L:90%
space X code. So we'll do the irish project

96
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.060 A:middle L:90%
first. And so in X code you choose open

97
00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:13.720 A:middle L:90%
a project or file and then go to wherever you're

98
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.220 A:middle L:90%
, you initialize your project. So mine is here

99
00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.250 A:middle L:90%
and then open the IOS directory. So this is

100
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.870 A:middle L:90%
this is very important. So if you go inside

101
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.230 A:middle L:90%
the IOS directory, you actually have two of these

102
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.730 A:middle L:90%
files, you have a X code project and a

103
00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:32.470 A:middle L:90%
workspace and one of these doesn't recognize pods. So

104
00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:36.990 A:middle L:90%
just to like avoid the possibility of that issue happening

105
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.350 A:middle L:90%
, just click analyze directory and hit open and I

106
00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:44.000 A:middle L:90%
will open the correct project. So one thing that

107
00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:45.850 A:middle L:90%
we, we didn't have to do because we're using

108
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.360 A:middle L:90%
a template is installing dependencies but I just want to

109
00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.160 A:middle L:90%
run you through how dependencies work. For example,

110
00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.350 A:middle L:90%
if you were using a project but working on a

111
00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:56.579 A:middle L:90%
project with a team. So there are two kinds

112
00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.790 A:middle L:90%
of dependencies in playing react native you have your JavaScript

113
00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.279 A:middle L:90%
dependencies and you have your native dependencies. So to

114
00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:05.980 A:middle L:90%
install the JavaScript dependencies, you simply run yarn or

115
00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.089 A:middle L:90%
NPM install. So you'll be familiar with that already

116
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.310 A:middle L:90%
. But because we are now building a native app

117
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:13.839 A:middle L:90%
, we don't just have the JavaScript dependencies to worry

118
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.000 A:middle L:90%
about. We also need to install the native dependencies

119
00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:18.660 A:middle L:90%
. So if you were using X ray before expert

120
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.310 A:middle L:90%
managed all that for you, They chose, they

121
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.600 A:middle L:90%
picked and chose the native dependencies that they think you

122
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:25.930 A:middle L:90%
might use and they handle that. But now that

123
00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:27.860 A:middle L:90%
we are building our own app, we need to

124
00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:31.490 A:middle L:90%
also install the native dependencies. So on IOS,

125
00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:34.689 A:middle L:90%
the build dependencies in react native and managed using coca

126
00:06:35.079 --> 00:06:37.629 A:middle L:90%
pots or pots for shorts and you can think of

127
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.620 A:middle L:90%
cocoa pods kind of like the IOS version of NPM

128
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.709 A:middle L:90%
and the way it works is quite similar as well

129
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.279 A:middle L:90%
. So to install the native IOS dependencies, we

130
00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:48.410 A:middle L:90%
need to run the install commands in the projects IOS

131
00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:51.379 A:middle L:90%
director. So you'll see it into IOS and run

132
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.420 A:middle L:90%
pod install, we'll be doing this a lot better

133
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:56.220 A:middle L:90%
of course because we're using a lot of native native

134
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:00.189 A:middle L:90%
libraries. What dependencies work very similar to the arctic

135
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.199 A:middle L:90%
dependencies. So in javascript you have a package,

136
00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:07.939 A:middle L:90%
Jason which is the list of dependencies on. In

137
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.569 A:middle L:90%
parts, you have a pot file which is the

138
00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.569 A:middle L:90%
list of your dependencies in IOS, you have a

139
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.189 A:middle L:90%
young lock or an NPM lock, which is the

140
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.829 A:middle L:90%
all the generated file that records exactly which version.

141
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.540 A:middle L:90%
Or it depends if you're using in cocoa pods,

142
00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:24.170 A:middle L:90%
you have a pot fire log, which does the

143
00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:27.790 A:middle L:90%
same. And finally, on in geological dependencies,

144
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:31.279 A:middle L:90%
you have node modules, which is the like project

145
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.000 A:middle L:90%
dependencies, which you don't check in to get an

146
00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:36.379 A:middle L:90%
equivalently on IOS, you have opposed directory that works

147
00:07:36.579 --> 00:07:36.870 A:middle L:90%
the same way.
