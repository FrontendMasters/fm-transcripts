00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.830
Hi there, and welcome to this
intermediate React Native course.

2
00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.184
So, in this course we are going to use
this course website that you can access

3
00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:12.900
and basically all the course
materials are available from here.

4
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.258
So you can follow along and you can
also reference things if you miss what I

5
00:00:17.258 --> 00:00:20.130
was typing, it can use the light or
dark modes.

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.770
I'm going to go for
dark mode just to match all my editors.

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.375
And if we go to course, so
we've got a course structure here and

8
00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:31.470
basically the format will be, I'm going
to go through this course page and

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.268
we're going to build
a React Native app together.

10
00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.980
So, my name is Kadi Kraman.

11
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.374
I am a Principal Engineer
at Formidable and

12
00:00:38.374 --> 00:00:41.150
I mostly build things using JavaScript.

13
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.860
So, these days I mostly use
React Native and Graph QL.

14
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.730
I've been doing web development in React
since 2015 and React Native since 2017.

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.620
I've been super fortunate to
have been involved in several

16
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.509
exciting end to end React Native
projects over the years and

17
00:00:56.509 --> 00:01:00.237
I'm really excited to share some of
the things I've learned along the way.

18
00:01:02.763 --> 00:01:07.350
So, this course is going to be
an intermediate React Native course.

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.520
So it's going to expect you
to know the basics already.

20
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.570
In particular, you should already
be familiar with View Text,

21
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.890
Touchable Opacity,
Flat List and Scroll View.

22
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.360
You should already know how to style
your components using Stylesheet.

23
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.400
And you should have an idea on how to
use Stack Navigator in React Navigation.

24
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.313
We also expect you to be
able to use the basic

25
00:01:29.313 --> 00:01:33.535
react hooks the use state use effect and
use callback.

26
00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:38.644
In this course we are not going to be
used expert will use plain React Native

27
00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:40.852
that means we're getting fully native and

28
00:01:40.852 --> 00:01:44.070
you need to build the actual
app on your device.

29
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.034
That means if you want
to build an IOS app,

30
00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:48.650
you will also need to use a Mac device.

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.338
Aside from that restriction, please feel
free to follow along with Android or

32
00:01:53.338 --> 00:01:55.597
IOS Oracle's both.

33
00:01:55.597 --> 00:01:59.070
I myself will be using VS code for
my code editor.

34
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.074
An iPhone 12 simulator and
an Android pixel five emulator throughout.

35
00:02:03.074 --> 00:02:06.178
Throughout the course,
usually at the end of the page,

36
00:02:06.178 --> 00:02:09.750
but sometimes in the middle,
you'll see these blue banners.

37
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.271
And this is basically
a link to a commit for

38
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:15.570
the demo app that we're
going to be building.

39
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.204
So if you want to check your work, or

40
00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:21.124
you want to make sure that you're in the
right place, just reference these commits,

41
00:02:21.124 --> 00:02:23.805
and you'll see the actual code
that's used in the demos.

42
00:02:23.805 --> 00:02:25.840
Now look at what we're
going to be building.

43
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.566
We are basically going to be
building this mood app so

44
00:02:30.566 --> 00:02:32.890
you can record your moods
throughout the day.

45
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.442
So we have a list of emojis
where you can pick our moods.

46
00:02:37.442 --> 00:02:39.377
Notice we have a little
animation on the button.

47
00:02:43.303 --> 00:02:46.503
Then we have a tab layout
with the history tabs so

48
00:02:46.503 --> 00:02:49.233
we can look at past moods in our history.

49
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:54.110
We can delete the moods from the list and

50
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.320
also we have implemented we
will implement swipe delete.

51
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.081
And on the last hour we have a little
pie chart for the ratio of moods so

52
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:04.860
we're going to be using.

53
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.160
Let's start by creating a new project.

54
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.527
So let's open the terminal.

55
00:03:12.772 --> 00:03:15.540
And we want to copy this MPX command.

56
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.722
So this is a react-native init
commands that will create an app

57
00:03:18.722 --> 00:03:20.270
called MoodTracker.

58
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.954
And it's using the react-native
typescript template.

59
00:03:28.793 --> 00:03:33.127
So this is going to take a little while
because what it does is it downloads

60
00:03:33.127 --> 00:03:38.440
a template then it does yarn install to
install all your JavaScript dependencies.

61
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.098
And then it also does pod install to
install all their IOS dependencies

62
00:03:42.098 --> 00:03:43.649
if you're building on a Mac.

63
00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:46.915
So this is why it takes a little while for
this command to run.

64
00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:52.474
So I already have mood
tracker in this directory, so

65
00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:55.260
I'm going to delete it and run this again.

66
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.310
Okay, we're done.

67
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.369
Okay, so whenever you start a new project,
and this is something I always do so

68
00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:08.429
even if you're not sharing it with anyone,
even if it's just by yourself, or

69
00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:14.270
just like a demo thing that you're trying
out, still make it into a git repository.

70
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:21.794
So you just get in it, get at everything
and get commit,initial commit

71
00:04:25.212 --> 00:04:29.008
And the reason that I always do that
is then anything that I add later,

72
00:04:29.008 --> 00:04:33.402
I will always know exactly what I've added
because you can look at the git diff.

73
00:04:33.402 --> 00:04:37.221
And whenever you get to a point where
things are working, just commit it,

74
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:39.508
because if in the future
you add something.

75
00:04:39.508 --> 00:04:43.104
And it happens a lot in React Native
because if you mess with the native

76
00:04:43.104 --> 00:04:45.336
dependencies on Xcode or Android Studio,

77
00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:48.380
you change something you don't
know where it changed it.

78
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.340
It's just good to have
a state to get back to.

79
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.585
So always do this.

80
00:04:55.381 --> 00:04:58.883
All right, so
let's now open this in Xcode.

81
00:04:58.883 --> 00:05:04.803
So can I space Xcode so
I'll do the iOS project first and

82
00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:09.822
so in Xcode you choose open a project or
file and

83
00:05:09.822 --> 00:05:15.247
then go to wherever you
initialize your project.

84
00:05:15.247 --> 00:05:20.481
So mine is here and then open the iOS
directory this is very important so

85
00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:26.249
if you go inside the iOS directory you
actually have two of these files you have

86
00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:32.060
a Xcode project and a workspace and
one of these doesn't recognize pods.

87
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.308
So just to, like avoid the possibility
of that issue happening,

88
00:05:36.308 --> 00:05:42.290
just click on highest directory and hit
open and they'll open the correct project.

89
00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.265
So one thing that we didn't
have to do because we're using

90
00:05:45.265 --> 00:05:47.680
a template is installing dependencies.

91
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.930
But I just wanna run you
through how dependencies work.

92
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.780
For example, if you were using a project
but working on a project with a team.

93
00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.330
So there are two kinds of
dependencies in playing react native.

94
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.970
You have your JavaScript dependencies and
you have your native dependencies.

95
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.111
So to install, the Java Script
dependencies, you simply run yarn or

96
00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:05.910
NPM install.

97
00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.980
So you'll be familiar with that already.

98
00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.450
But because we are now
building a native app.

99
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:13.826
We don't just have the JavaScript
dependencies to worry about we also need

100
00:06:13.826 --> 00:06:15.840
to install the native dependencies.

101
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.840
So, if you were using Expo,
before Expo managed all that for you,

102
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.842
they chose, they picked, and
chose the native dependencies that

103
00:06:21.842 --> 00:06:24.510
they think you might use,
and they handle all of that.

104
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:26.268
But now that we are building our own app,

105
00:06:26.268 --> 00:06:28.350
we need to also install
a native dependencies.

106
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.330
So, on iOS, the build
dependencies in React Native, and

107
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.241
managed using Cocoa pods or
pods for shorts, and

108
00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:40.740
you can think of cocoa pods kind
of like the iOS version of NPM.

109
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.780
And the way it works is
quite similar as well.

110
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:44.856
So to install the native iOS dependencies,

111
00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:48.760
we'll need to run the install command
in the project's iOS directory.

112
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.210
So you'll CD into iOS and run pod install.

113
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.953
We'll be doing this a lot about
the course, because we're using a lot of

114
00:06:55.953 --> 00:07:00.900
native libraries, but dependencies work,
very similar to geometry dependencies.

115
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.741
So, in JavaScript,
you have a package Jason,

116
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:06.093
which is the list of the dependencies.

117
00:07:06.093 --> 00:07:10.472
On imports you have a pod file which
is the list of your dependencies.

118
00:07:10.472 --> 00:07:15.444
In iOS you have a yarn lock or an NPM
lock which is the auto generated file

119
00:07:15.444 --> 00:07:20.357
that records exactly which version or
dependencies you're using.

120
00:07:20.357 --> 00:07:24.829
In CocoaPods you have a pod
file lock which does the same.

121
00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:28.925
And finally on in JavaScript dependencies
you'll have node modules which is

122
00:07:28.925 --> 00:07:32.202
the like project dependencies
which you don't check in to get

123
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:36.060
an equivalent to an iOS you have a post
directory that works the same way.
