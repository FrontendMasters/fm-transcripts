00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.720
Okay, excellent.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.438
So, now we have a splash screen, so

3
00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:09.526
this is a React Native specific
plug problem with splash screens.

4
00:00:09.526 --> 00:00:13.174
So when you open your app
you'll see a splash screen, and

5
00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:16.710
then you see a white page and
then use your app.

6
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.276
And the reason this is actually
happening is because this splash

7
00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:22.000
screen is completely native.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.500
So that's why we had to create an xcode.

9
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.810
So what's the need to have does?

10
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.030
Is it goes, let's show the splash
screen while I'm getting ready.

11
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.587
But then it loads the app with
the JavaScript bundle and it goes, okay,

12
00:00:34.587 --> 00:00:35.540
you're ready.

13
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.440
Let's show it.

14
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.797
But actually the JavaScript still
needs some extra time to load,

15
00:00:39.797 --> 00:00:41.760
which is why we get this flash screen.

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.948
So this is the time in between the native,
when the native app is ready but

17
00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:48.890
the JavaScript isn't loaded yet.

18
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.870
So the way to overcome this is we need to
use another library to basically manually

19
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.910
hide the splash screen when
the JavaScript is finished loading.

20
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.989
So, here if we add so here if we do
yarn add React Native slash screen

21
00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.672
And this is quite an old library so
it still requires a React Native link it

22
00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:24.270
doesn't auto link I think I
need to put this through.

23
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.066
So cd IOS and pod install.

24
00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:38.014
And we'll also need to add a little
bit of native code to iOS so

25
00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:41.280
we've been getting off easy with iOS so
far but

26
00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.303
if you open app delegate dot m so
it's this one's not the head of file and

27
00:01:46.303 --> 00:01:49.352
then we add an import
at the top of the file.

28
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:58.230
And here on the application
we show the splash screen.

29
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.300
So this will be just underneath

30
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.591
here in the application.

31
00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.240
Excellent.

32
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.276
So basically what we're doing is were
using React Native splash screen

33
00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:22.040
to explicitly show the splash screen and
then we can use it to hide it.

34
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.855
So in our app.tsx

35
00:02:31.336 --> 00:02:37.809
We will import flash screen from
React Native splash screen and

36
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.814
then it will do a react dot
use effect with an empty

37
00:02:42.814 --> 00:02:48.811
dependencies array and
we will do splash screen dot hide.

38
00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:52.770
To explicitly hide it.

39
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.055
Now put in a use effect because basically
once we reach this point JavaScript has

40
00:03:01.055 --> 00:03:04.410
loaded because we're in JavaScript and
then we hide it.

41
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.760
Now if your app does need to do some
extra things behind the scene, for

42
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.026
example if you need to update something or
if you need to maybe fetch some user data.

43
00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:16.979
Or you need to set up auth
from async storage or

44
00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:20.569
anything like that,
you can delay when you hide this.

45
00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.042
So you could do something else you get
fisher data like fetch user data from

46
00:03:24.042 --> 00:03:27.403
eating storage or something like that and
then hide the splash screen so

47
00:03:27.403 --> 00:03:28.877
that's how you achieve that.

48
00:03:31.797 --> 00:03:35.007
Alright so this is finished and

49
00:03:35.007 --> 00:03:39.455
let's do yarn iOS again
let me just close it

50
00:03:48.998 --> 00:03:51.640
It's complaining because I haven't
actually rebuilt the native bundle yet.

51
00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.290
All right, it's worked let's try it,
let's look at this again.

52
00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.779
So now when I launch the app, you can see
that it goes straight from a splash screen

53
00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.754
straight into our app and we don't
get that white screen in the middle.
