00:00:00.436 --> 00:00:03.638
All right,
let's see how to implement this pet type.

2
00:00:03.638 --> 00:00:06.543
So we already have a name,
which is a string.

3
00:00:06.543 --> 00:00:10.006
Now let's look at the second type,
so we have kind,

4
00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:12.465
which can be a cat, a dog, or a fish.

5
00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:16.537
So I could do kind is a string,
because they're all string elements.

6
00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:21.497
However, we can actually be more strict
here because if I needed a string,

7
00:00:21.497 --> 00:00:25.134
I could type whatever here and
it would still be valid.

8
00:00:25.134 --> 00:00:29.874
So, let's use the old type and
call it a cat or a fish.

9
00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:34.987
Or a dog.

10
00:00:37.027 --> 00:00:39.962
Now this means if you get different
kinds of pets introduced,

11
00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.830
you'll need to add it to the coins.

12
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.646
Next up we have an age,
so we got 10, 2 and 1 so

13
00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:48.358
we can see that the age is a number.

14
00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:52.364
Now I got a favorite foods.

15
00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:56.970
So we have an array of strings,
an array of one string and

16
00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.186
an array of a string, so
let's do favorite foods.

17
00:01:03.578 --> 00:01:06.582
Let's make it a string, all right

18
00:01:09.383 --> 00:01:14.328
Next up we have a function for speak,
so this just console logs something in

19
00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:19.050
this console log something and
this doesn't have the speak function.

20
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.226
So let's do speak, and
let's make it an error function and

21
00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:25.157
then they get return void.

22
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:32.344
Okay, so it works here,
but here on the fish.

23
00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:38.574
We don't have a speak function,
so we need to make this optional.

24
00:01:38.574 --> 00:01:43.775
So let's add a question mark before
the colon, and now it's an optional type.

25
00:01:43.775 --> 00:01:49.960
And lastly we have an owner, so
an owner is an object with two properties.

26
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.513
So we can easily add an object
here called owner, and

27
00:01:54.513 --> 00:02:01.880
we'll make this into an object, and we'll
do name, string and age, none of that.

28
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.497
You could also pull this
out into a separate type,

29
00:02:07.497 --> 00:02:11.509
so you could do type owner equals and

30
00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:15.536
then copy the name and the age here.

31
00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.626
And in our pet type,
we can reference this own type instead.

32
00:02:29.626 --> 00:02:33.330
And for example if this owner was
an array, so if we had multiple owners,

33
00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.047
you could add an array in the end.

34
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:37.163
So this is how you can combine types.
