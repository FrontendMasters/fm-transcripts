00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.600 A:middle L:90%
for the bottom tab. How can we enlarger animate

2
00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.060 A:middle L:90%
a tab on click because we know if the selected

3
00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.220 A:middle L:90%
shade changes we could trigger an animation here and just

4
00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.390 A:middle L:90%
animated styles. So you can animate Svg elements especies

5
00:00:16.739 --> 00:00:18.859 A:middle L:90%
actually awesome for animating, you can create animated spg

6
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.089 A:middle L:90%
so you can like enlarge it or something. Um

7
00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.739 A:middle L:90%
So I think I would do it here but I

8
00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.769 A:middle L:90%
think it depends on the like specific animation as well

9
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.510 A:middle L:90%
because a lot of animations are kind of sleight of

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.630 A:middle L:90%
hand. So for example a recent animation that I

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.840 A:middle L:90%
built was we have a search box at the top

12
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.890 A:middle L:90%
of the page and then when you tap on the

13
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.689 A:middle L:90%
search box, the page kind of fades into the

14
00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:46.920 A:middle L:90%
search page. Right? Which kind of looks like

15
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.439 A:middle L:90%
there's a search page that opens up on top of

16
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.600 A:middle L:90%
your current content but actually what it is, it's

17
00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.640 A:middle L:90%
just a murder with a fancy animation. So um

18
00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 A:middle L:90%
like it will depend on the actual animation, like

19
00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.969 A:middle L:90%
how complex it is or how simple. So a

20
00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.689 A:middle L:90%
lot of animations would just be over laid on top

21
00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.829 A:middle L:90%
of your content. So they give the effect of

22
00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.290 A:middle L:90%
something happening. We're actually like behind the scenes is

23
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.959 A:middle L:90%
kind of sleight of hand for network image is how

24
00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.900 A:middle L:90%
do we handle high resolution images is receiving different U

25
00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:16.049 A:middle L:90%
. R. L. S for different resolutions.

26
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.480 A:middle L:90%
The only way, yes. Um so usually you

27
00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:26.439 A:middle L:90%
would use um like there are a bunch of different

28
00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:30.120 A:middle L:90%
um like image, see DNS that basically give you

29
00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.069 A:middle L:90%
the like image based on the size that you put

30
00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:35.950 A:middle L:90%
in the Ural which is pretty common solution on the

31
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.859 A:middle L:90%
web as well I think. So usually what you

32
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.530 A:middle L:90%
would do, like what I would do is you

33
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.359 A:middle L:90%
get the pixel the density of the device which I

34
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.719 A:middle L:90%
think is in platform where you can get the pixel

35
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.359 A:middle L:90%
density of the device and then you request the image

36
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.189 A:middle L:90%
based on the size that you need to render it

37
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.750 A:middle L:90%
two times the pixel density and then and then basically

38
00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.859 A:middle L:90%
you get it so it would be just by different

39
00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.629 A:middle L:90%
murals. Um So if you have user generated content

40
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.859 A:middle L:90%
you need to make sure that when the user uploads

41
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.819 A:middle L:90%
the image you do some processing on your back end

42
00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:09.259 A:middle L:90%
to be able to support different images. So if

43
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:12.729 A:middle L:90%
they upload a like a huge image um you don't

44
00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.240 A:middle L:90%
wanna just render it as is in europe. Have

45
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.349 A:middle L:90%
a question why wouldn't we use required code directly in

46
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.389 A:middle L:90%
the image source rather than defining a const outside of

47
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.520 A:middle L:90%
the components? Um Absolutely no reason. Feel free

48
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.550 A:middle L:90%
to do that. Um I think it's just a

49
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.009 A:middle L:90%
habit because the in line requires weren't supported until recently

50
00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:35.439 A:middle L:90%
so my habit is to add that requires um at

51
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.460 A:middle L:90%
the top of the page but there's no reason to

52
00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:41.400 A:middle L:90%
do that anymore. And then can you use import

53
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.340 A:middle L:90%
syntax rather than required to load images? No,

54
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.030 A:middle L:90%
no you can't. So I actually had one other

55
00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.180 A:middle L:90%
thing that I just remembered that I wanted to wanted

56
00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.900 A:middle L:90%
to share as a tip um If you get stds

57
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.110 A:middle L:90%
from from your workplace or or your designers and you

58
00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.219 A:middle L:90%
need to convert them into these stds to use in

59
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.050 A:middle L:90%
your app a lot of the time. The spg

60
00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.219 A:middle L:90%
said you get, you get don't look as clean

61
00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.650 A:middle L:90%
as this, there's a lot of time, there's

62
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.039 A:middle L:90%
like transitions and it's like g like the group elements

63
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.710 A:middle L:90%
all over the place they don't really need, but

64
00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.439 A:middle L:90%
you don't want to update them by hand. So

65
00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:19.050 A:middle L:90%
there's a couple of tools out there that will help

66
00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.409 A:middle L:90%
you and one of them, the one I use

67
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.280 A:middle L:90%
is um react native spdr, which has this playground

68
00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.080 A:middle L:90%
and basically, so here's an example of an SVG

69
00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.759 A:middle L:90%
element and this is pretty typical of something that you

70
00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.050 A:middle L:90%
might receive from a designer. You know, it

71
00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.930 A:middle L:90%
has all this metadata from where it was generated and

72
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.159 A:middle L:90%
it's got a bunch of G elements and there's some

73
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.740 A:middle L:90%
like a bunch of translations that you don't, I

74
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.800 A:middle L:90%
don't want. And here this actually like gives you

75
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.250 A:middle L:90%
options, it will create the component for you.

76
00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.909 A:middle L:90%
So if you wanted to, you could do react

77
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.759 A:middle L:90%
native and whether you want to pass the properties,

78
00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:58.240 A:middle L:90%
so like um like here to the SpG or not

79
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.009 A:middle L:90%
and you can see that it ties it up.

80
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.180 A:middle L:90%
So this whole component turns into this, so usually

81
00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.389 A:middle L:90%
what I do because I don't like quite like the

82
00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.210 A:middle L:90%
syntax of this is if I get an spg,

83
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.159 A:middle L:90%
I will paste it into here generated, react native

84
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.089 A:middle L:90%
component and just copy this bit uh into my code

85
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.750 A:middle L:90%
. So one thing to note, for some reason

86
00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.949 A:middle L:90%
, they all always add this uh X M L

87
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.509 A:middle L:90%
N S property and this isn't a valid property in

88
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.779 A:middle L:90%
react native spG. So after you um copy it

89
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.550 A:middle L:90%
, you'll have to remove it. But that's my

90
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.939 A:middle L:90%
this has saved me hours of my life. So

91
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.730 A:middle L:90%
you mentioned tabs and drawers as the main navigation.

92
00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.839 A:middle L:90%
Is there any other navigations or types of navigation?

93
00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:49.779 A:middle L:90%
Um Okay, so we have uh tabs stacks,

94
00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.149 A:middle L:90%
you have tab navigation, you have stuck navigation and

95
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.399 A:middle L:90%
then you have models. Um so so there's an

96
00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.160 A:middle L:90%
example I have on get up. Um I have

97
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.860 A:middle L:90%
a demo project for that has navigation set up,

98
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.629 A:middle L:90%
which I just, I'll do this. This is

99
00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:13.480 A:middle L:90%
a template project that has a two tab layout with

100
00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:18.680 A:middle L:90%
two models um and a stack navigator. So if

101
00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.810 A:middle L:90%
you look at the navigation street here, so we

102
00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:24.209 A:middle L:90%
got the root stack, then we got the bottom

103
00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.300 A:middle L:90%
tabs. So you could have these two tabs.

104
00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:29.410 A:middle L:90%
And then we got on the home tab we have

105
00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.860 A:middle L:90%
a stack navigator inside it. So if you go

106
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.879 A:middle L:90%
to open second page here, it will open a

107
00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:37.790 A:middle L:90%
page inside your home navigator. And then in the

108
00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:40.060 A:middle L:90%
other tab this is just a tab on its own

109
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.439 A:middle L:90%
. So the other tab looks exactly like our tab

110
00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:45.779 A:middle L:90%
tabs look like, so we don't have anything nesting

111
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.040 A:middle L:90%
inside. And then lastly we have a model and

112
00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.939 A:middle L:90%
you'll notice that this model is adjacent to the bottom

113
00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:57.550 A:middle L:90%
tabs rather than inside it. And that's because I

114
00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.360 A:middle L:90%
want the myrtle to appear over the bottom tabs and

115
00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:03.860 A:middle L:90%
that's why we need to have a stack Navigator at

116
00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.230 A:middle L:90%
the very top level so you could put both of

117
00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.649 A:middle L:90%
the bottom tabs. Navigator and the example Murder inside

118
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.300 A:middle L:90%
that. I need to update the TypeScript types for

119
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.379 A:middle L:90%
navigation on here but otherwise you can use this for

120
00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:19.420 A:middle L:90%
reference. So if you look at the she looked

121
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.100 A:middle L:90%
at the template. Source screens. So this follows

122
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.600 A:middle L:90%
the same format as as we did in our workshop

123
00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.629 A:middle L:90%
so we have bottom tabs. Navigator modal screen home

124
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.139 A:middle L:90%
tab. So if you go to route Navigator we'll

125
00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:37.720 A:middle L:90%
see that we have so root stack. So this

126
00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.910 A:middle L:90%
is a stack Navigator And then it has two things

127
00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:43.839 A:middle L:90%
inside. So you have the bottom tabs which is

128
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.790 A:middle L:90%
most of your content and then you have a model

129
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.620 A:middle L:90%
which is like a full screen modal. So usually

130
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.970 A:middle L:90%
when I build apps this is the format that I

131
00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:53.910 A:middle L:90%
go with, so you have a root stack,

132
00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.050 A:middle L:90%
you have a tab and then all of your full

133
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.949 A:middle L:90%
screen models will be here. So you might have

134
00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:02.430 A:middle L:90%
like 20 and then obviously for each other models,

135
00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.959 A:middle L:90%
if the Murder itself has a stack Navigator. So

136
00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:07.589 A:middle L:90%
if you can navigate the screens within the model,

137
00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:10.000 A:middle L:90%
like you can do that so you can have the

138
00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:17.139 A:middle L:90%
component B in itself A stack Navigator. Yeah.

139
00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:19.540 A:middle L:90%
And this is a template. So you can you

140
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.500 A:middle L:90%
can try it out if you just in its new

141
00:07:22.709 --> 00:07:23.509 A:middle L:90%
up using this as a template.
