00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.465
Next up let's talk about
adding custom fonts, so

2
00:00:03.465 --> 00:00:07.471
when you're building an app for
a client or company you work for

3
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:12.327
more often than not you will have a custom
font that they'll want you to use.

4
00:00:12.327 --> 00:00:16.905
So let's look at add how you would add
custom fonts to your React Native app.

5
00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:21.758
So for free funds, if you want to just
add something to your own personal app,

6
00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:26.475
google funds is a really nice resource,
you can explore different funds.

7
00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.682
You can look at which languages they
support and how many styles they have.

8
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:38.500
But this exercise I have chosen a font for
us, so this one is called column.

9
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.522
The main reason I chose it is
because it's a handwriting font so

10
00:00:41.522 --> 00:00:43.410
be super distinctive, once we add it.

11
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.020
So here it will also show you which
versions, which styles of the font,

12
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.443
this includes, so this has a light
medium and a bold version.

13
00:00:54.443 --> 00:00:59.405
So if you want to choose a different font,
make sure that it has at least a regular

14
00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:04.910
and a bold version, because those are the
two we're currently using in our app.

15
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.457
So, in this page if we go
to download font family.

16
00:01:10.793 --> 00:01:12.545
Open it, and unzip it.

17
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.850
Okay, so we see we get bold,
regular and light.

18
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.387
So, here's an interesting thing
with fonts with React Native,

19
00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:27.282
IOS and Android treat font differently.

20
00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:31.969
So for android, we can use the actual
file name as the font family, and

21
00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.069
it will just work,
on iOS this doesn't work,

22
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.300
because the iOS users
the PostScript name of the fund.

23
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.634
So if I, for example, if I double click
this to install the font on my Mac,

24
00:01:44.634 --> 00:01:46.451
so we're going so font.

25
00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:48.806
And here do opens in a font book,

26
00:01:48.806 --> 00:01:54.149
you can see that it has a postscript
name which is called column regular.

27
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.310
Now if I was to rename this file,
this postscript name won't change so

28
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.767
on IOS the font would never load.

29
00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:06.856
So when you're adding fonts, to your app,
if you're also supporting iOS, make

30
00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:11.760
sure that you check that the postscript
name, is the same as the file name.

31
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.177
This is to ensure that your fonts
will work on both iOS and Android,

32
00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:17.984
99% of the time,
this will already be the case, but

33
00:02:17.984 --> 00:02:22.096
sometimes when you get assets from
clients, they will have renamed that file.

34
00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:24.830
So they don't match.

35
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.630
So that's something to watch out for.

36
00:02:30.353 --> 00:02:35.303
All right, so in our app,
let's go to our assets directory, and

37
00:02:35.303 --> 00:02:39.270
let's create a new folder and
let's call it funds.

38
00:02:42.697 --> 00:02:43.498
Yeah.

39
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:55.393
And we want to drag these fonts
into our fonts directory,

40
00:02:55.393 --> 00:03:00.523
so let me just open with terminal.

41
00:03:10.378 --> 00:03:14.222
So I wanna drag them in here.

42
00:03:14.222 --> 00:03:15.765
[COUGH]

43
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.537
Cool, so all our fonts are in here.

44
00:03:26.537 --> 00:03:29.002
Now the next thing is you want to,

45
00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:32.800
link these fonts within
our native applications.

46
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.630
So we need to create a new file
called React Native config.js.

47
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.130
So this will be at the very
root level of your application,

48
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.860
so we'll do a new file
React Native contact.js.

49
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.760
And in here we'll do module exports and
we just want to give

50
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.670
it the assets directory and
link it to where our fonts are.

51
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.510
So for copy this.

52
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.674
So, we'll do modular exports, assets which
is an array and then this will link to,

53
00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:10.842
will be a path to our fonts directory
which is here assets and fonts.

54
00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:18.516
The last thing you need to
do is open a terminal and

55
00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:21.592
run MPX React Native link.

56
00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:29.126
So what this does is links those funds,

57
00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:35.765
copies those funds to your Xcode and
your Android project,

58
00:04:35.765 --> 00:04:41.620
so actually if we look at
the diff in our checkpoint.

59
00:04:45.037 --> 00:04:50.282
You will see that we added the fonts
just to this assets directory but

60
00:04:50.282 --> 00:04:55.631
because we ran React Native link,
these get copied here to Android.

61
00:04:55.631 --> 00:05:00.400
So it creates an SSH directory on
Android in the right place, and

62
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.326
they also get added separately to iOS.

63
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:10.681
So here we've got the resources
section and these are the fonts.

64
00:05:10.681 --> 00:05:14.303
So this is what the React Native
link command does behind the scenes.

65
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.022
And lastly, because we have
added something to our native

66
00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:28.641
directories we need to rebuild our apps,
so let's run Yan iOS

67
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.365
And also rebuild our Android project

68
00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:59.275
Now, the way you use custom funds
is if you remember from earlier,

69
00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:03.835
we added this theme file where we
want to store all of our app themes,

70
00:06:03.835 --> 00:06:05.835
anything to do with styling.

71
00:06:05.835 --> 00:06:12.748
So I usually add the font families
to the theme file as well,

72
00:06:12.748 --> 00:06:16.632
so if I copy this and open themes.

73
00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:20.737
At the end we just have color,
you can do coz.

74
00:06:23.723 --> 00:06:27.319
Once and these are the font
families that we can use so

75
00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.115
we've got a ball with regular load one.

76
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:37.112
I'm just gonna wait for
the bill to finish.

77
00:06:38.238 --> 00:06:41.081
Excellent, so now our app has been built.

78
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:45.221
So, let's just go to our mood picker, and

79
00:06:45.221 --> 00:06:49.140
that's fine where we have text, okay.

80
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.507
So we have, the how are you right now,

81
00:06:52.507 --> 00:06:57.146
which is a heading, and
here we can do fun to family.

82
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.991
Should be theme, dots,
font family regular,

83
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:07.884
actually we'll do font family bold.

84
00:07:09.106 --> 00:07:15.232
Font family bold, and
you can see it's updated.

85
00:07:15.232 --> 00:07:18.262
And now we can remove this bolt from here.

86
00:07:21.071 --> 00:07:26.781
So this metadata like it is part of
the font family, metadata as well but

87
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:32.871
again because of the inconsistency with
some of the fonts that you receive,

88
00:07:32.871 --> 00:07:37.073
I like to set it explicitly
in the font family level.

89
00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:42.296
And let's change all the other ones so

90
00:07:42.296 --> 00:07:47.758
we've got a button text,
size, do font family.

91
00:07:49.577 --> 00:07:51.920
Theme and family bold.

92
00:07:51.920 --> 00:08:00.985
Then we have this description text.

93
00:08:00.985 --> 00:08:06.595
On the theme, on travel to bold.

94
00:08:15.666 --> 00:08:17.499
Then we got the button.

95
00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:22.670
And okay, so
we've got this heading here as well.

96
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:29.689
So the way you do heading text is if
we go to the bottom tabs navigator,

97
00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:35.013
in the screen options,
we have a tab bar item style,

98
00:08:35.013 --> 00:08:39.991
label style and
this will be just a style object.

99
00:08:39.991 --> 00:08:41.766
So I think if I did color.

100
00:08:43.151 --> 00:08:46.825
It would go to pink.

101
00:08:49.232 --> 00:08:55.756
Not the tab bar,
I think we have the top bar, header bar.

102
00:09:03.977 --> 00:09:07.764
Header title style that's why this,

103
00:09:07.764 --> 00:09:13.098
see title is handy never
have to look at Doc's again.

104
00:09:13.098 --> 00:09:18.306
They do color pink,
okay so good okay cool.

105
00:09:18.306 --> 00:09:23.955
S o because this is the style
of this text element,

106
00:09:23.955 --> 00:09:28.930
we can set the font
family here Font family,

107
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.578
theme and font family regular.

108
00:09:34.048 --> 00:09:39.357
And then lastly,
we have these mood item rows so

109
00:09:39.357 --> 00:09:42.285
we hope in the mood to row.

110
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:46.803
We have the mood description.

111
00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:53.579
So font, family, theme, font family bold.

112
00:09:55.855 --> 00:10:02.493
And Mood date,

113
00:10:02.493 --> 00:10:08.814
so this will be font family,
theme, font family regular,

114
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.001
Cool, I think we have everything styled.

115
00:10:17.001 --> 00:10:22.789
Let's see if this works on Android,
not sure if the app was actually rebuilt.

116
00:10:31.282 --> 00:10:35.005
Again, so we have this on Android as well.

117
00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:43.942
Except on choose button for some reason,
so that's why the reasons so here because

118
00:10:43.942 --> 00:10:49.208
we've got font weight bold, and the font
family I think those are conflicting.

119
00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:53.773
Yeah, so that's the reason that's
like if you're using fun family,

120
00:10:53.773 --> 00:10:59.660
I don't usually add a separate font weight
because, you can get strange effects.

121
00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.515
So who moved this, this will work again.

122
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:05.263
Excellent.

123
00:11:07.923 --> 00:11:12.855
Okay, another thing, I think we have some,
because this font has a higher

124
00:11:12.855 --> 00:11:17.730
line height than our previous font,
we're actually get a slight shift.

125
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.062
Now, in the height of this container, so

126
00:11:23.062 --> 00:11:28.934
I'm going to remove the padding
from come on where do I was

127
00:11:31.532 --> 00:11:38.018
I think from here, margin bottom.

128
00:11:44.654 --> 00:11:50.721
And then give it a fixed height,

129
00:11:50.721 --> 00:11:57.688
okay so we have our container here and

130
00:11:57.688 --> 00:12:03.552
I wanna give it a fixed height.

131
00:12:03.552 --> 00:12:07.783
Let's do 240, 250 and
there is 240, I'm gonna do 250.

132
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:14.623
And then if I do justify content,
space between,

133
00:12:14.623 --> 00:12:21.866
then I don't need the margin bottoms for
the padding anymore.

134
00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:30.822
So margin, bottom And margin top.

135
00:12:30.822 --> 00:12:34.480
Okay, so now when I toggle between them,
there you go.

136
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.802
So I want this screen and then this
picker screen to be the same height.

137
00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:44.691
So basically what I've done is I've
given the container a fixed height.

138
00:12:44.691 --> 00:12:49.766
And then I've said that justify content
space between which means that, however

139
00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:54.782
many content items we have, just make sure
that the space between them is equal.

140
00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:57.510
And then the first one is at
the top of the container.

141
00:12:57.510 --> 00:13:01.115
The last ones at the bottom
of the container.

142
00:13:01.115 --> 00:13:04.200
So just to the UI thing because it was
annoying me that it was flickering.
