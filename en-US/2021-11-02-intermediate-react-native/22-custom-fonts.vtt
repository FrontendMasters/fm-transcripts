00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.379 A:middle L:90%
next up, let's talk about adding custom funds.

2
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.019 A:middle L:90%
So when you're building it up for a client or

3
00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.660 A:middle L:90%
the company work for more often than not, you

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.509 A:middle L:90%
will have a custom fund that they want you to

5
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.730 A:middle L:90%
use. So let's look at how you would add

6
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.199 A:middle L:90%
custom funds to your react native app. So for

7
00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.199 A:middle L:90%
free funds, if you want to just add something

8
00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:23.620 A:middle L:90%
to your own personal lab, google funds is a

9
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.890 A:middle L:90%
really nice resource. You can explore different funds.

10
00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:29.710 A:middle L:90%
You can look at which languages they support and how

11
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.100 A:middle L:90%
many styles they have. But this exercise I have

12
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.079 A:middle L:90%
chosen a font for us. So this one is

13
00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:39.750 A:middle L:90%
called column. The main reason I chose it is

14
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.600 A:middle L:90%
because it's a handwriting font, it will be super

15
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.840 A:middle L:90%
distinctive once we added. So here it will also

16
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.649 A:middle L:90%
show you like which versions like which styles of the

17
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.979 A:middle L:90%
font this includes. So this has a light medium

18
00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.460 A:middle L:90%
and a bold version. So if you want to

19
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.100 A:middle L:90%
choose a different fund, make sure that it has

20
00:00:58.439 --> 00:01:02.539 A:middle L:90%
at least a regular and a bolt version because those

21
00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:04.379 A:middle L:90%
are the two we're currently using in our app.

22
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.939 A:middle L:90%
So in this page, if we go to download

23
00:01:07.769 --> 00:01:16.340 A:middle L:90%
fund family, open it and unzip it. Okay

24
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.709 A:middle L:90%
, so we see we get bold, regular and

25
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.640 A:middle L:90%
light. So here's an interesting thing with front with

26
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.400 A:middle L:90%
react native IOS and android treat front differently. So

27
00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.069 A:middle L:90%
for android we can use the actual file name as

28
00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.469 A:middle L:90%
the font family and it will just work on IOS

29
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.099 A:middle L:90%
. This doesn't work because the IOS uses the postscript

30
00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:39.799 A:middle L:90%
name of the front. So if I, for

31
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.930 A:middle L:90%
example, if I double click this to install the

32
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.420 A:middle L:90%
front on my Mac. So we're going still fund

33
00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.379 A:middle L:90%
And here it opens opens in the front book,

34
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.150 A:middle L:90%
you can see that it has a post script name

35
00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:54.469 A:middle L:90%
, which is called Callum regular. Now, if

36
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.760 A:middle L:90%
I was to rename this file, this postscript name

37
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.140 A:middle L:90%
won't change so on IOS, the funds would never

38
00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:04.170 A:middle L:90%
load. So when you're adding fonts to your app

39
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.370 A:middle L:90%
and if you're also supporting IOS, Make sure that

40
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.699 A:middle L:90%
you check that the postscript name is the same as

41
00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.080 A:middle L:90%
the file name. This is to ensure that your

42
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.810 A:middle L:90%
friends will work on both IOS and Android, of

43
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.240 A:middle L:90%
the time. This will already be the case.

44
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.900 A:middle L:90%
But sometimes when you get assets from clients, they

45
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.960 A:middle L:90%
would have renamed the file so they don't match.

46
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.569 A:middle L:90%
So there's something to watch out for. All right

47
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.689 A:middle L:90%
. So in our app, let's go to our

48
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.889 A:middle L:90%
assets directory and let's create a new folder and let's

49
00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:53.520 A:middle L:90%
call it once. Mhm. Fact. And we

50
00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.360 A:middle L:90%
want to drag these funds into our fonts directory.

51
00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:13.090 A:middle L:90%
So let me just open with terminal. So I

52
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:23.939 A:middle L:90%
won't drag them in here. Mm hmm. Cool

53
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.520 A:middle L:90%
. So all of our funds are in here now

54
00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.080 A:middle L:90%
. The next thing is you want to link these

55
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.240 A:middle L:90%
funds within our nature applications. So we need to

56
00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.650 A:middle L:90%
create a new file called react native config dot Js

57
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.659 A:middle L:90%
. So this will be at the very root level

58
00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.590 A:middle L:90%
of your application. So we'll do a new file

59
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.000 A:middle L:90%
react native contact dot yes. And in here we'll

60
00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.240 A:middle L:90%
do module dot exports and we just want to give

61
00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.930 A:middle L:90%
us the acids directory and link it to where our

62
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.870 A:middle L:90%
funds are. So if I copy this so we'll

63
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.500 A:middle L:90%
do much other exports acid, which is an array

64
00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:06.870 A:middle L:90%
and then this will link to will be a path

65
00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.370 A:middle L:90%
to our forest directory which is here assets and funds

66
00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:13.990 A:middle L:90%
. And then the last thing you need to do

67
00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:19.240 A:middle L:90%
is open a terminal terminal and run in PX react

68
00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.790 A:middle L:90%
native link. Yeah. So what this does is

69
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.569 A:middle L:90%
links those funds, copies those funds to your ex

70
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.350 A:middle L:90%
code and your android project. So actually, if

71
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.920 A:middle L:90%
we look at the the diff in a checkpoint,

72
00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.329 A:middle L:90%
you will see that um, that we added the

73
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.660 A:middle L:90%
fonts just to this assets directory. But because we

74
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.449 A:middle L:90%
ran a wreck native link, these get copied here

75
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.360 A:middle L:90%
to android. So it creates an asset directory on

76
00:04:57.459 --> 00:05:01.009 A:middle L:90%
android in the right place and they also get added

77
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.029 A:middle L:90%
separately to us. Uh, so here we've got

78
00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.529 A:middle L:90%
the resources section and these are the funds. So

79
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.180 A:middle L:90%
this is what the react Native link command does behind

80
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.800 A:middle L:90%
the scenes. And lastly, because we have added

81
00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.040 A:middle L:90%
something to our native directories, we need to rebuild

82
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.850 A:middle L:90%
our apps. So let's run, you're on IOS

83
00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:56.170 A:middle L:90%
and also rebuild our android project. Now the way

84
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.379 A:middle L:90%
you use custom funds is a human but from earlier

85
00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.110 A:middle L:90%
we added this theme file where we want to store

86
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.120 A:middle L:90%
all of our app themes, anything to do with

87
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.209 A:middle L:90%
styling. So I usually add the font families to

88
00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:10.730 A:middle L:90%
the theme file as well. So if I copy

89
00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:16.949 A:middle L:90%
this and open theme that T s at the moment

90
00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:24.839 A:middle L:90%
we just have colors you can do because once Yeah

91
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.920 A:middle L:90%
. And then these are the fun time list that

92
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:28.060 A:middle L:90%
we can use. So we've got a ball irregular

93
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.139 A:middle L:90%
. I loved one. I'm just gonna wait for

94
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:39.720 A:middle L:90%
the bill to finish. Excellence in our app has

95
00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:43.709 A:middle L:90%
been built. So let's just go to our mood

96
00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.240 A:middle L:90%
picker and that's fine where we have text. Okay

97
00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:51.980 A:middle L:90%
, so we have how are you right now?

98
00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.500 A:middle L:90%
Which is a heading and here we can do fund

99
00:06:56.779 --> 00:07:03.620 A:middle L:90%
family should be theme darts, fun family regular actually

100
00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:10.170 A:middle L:90%
will do fun family gold front. Mhm Family bolt

101
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.589 A:middle L:90%
. Yeah and you can see it's updated and now

102
00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:21.350 A:middle L:90%
we can remove this bold from here. So this

103
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:26.079 A:middle L:90%
metadata like it is part of the fun family metadata

104
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.579 A:middle L:90%
as well. But again, because of the inconsistency

105
00:07:31.439 --> 00:07:33.170 A:middle L:90%
with some of the funds that you receive, I

106
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.730 A:middle L:90%
like to set it explicitly in the front family level

107
00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.240 A:middle L:90%
and let's change all the other one. So we

108
00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:47.839 A:middle L:90%
got a button, text, let's do family theme

109
00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:52.230 A:middle L:90%
. I'm trying to be bold. Then we have

110
00:07:52.649 --> 00:08:06.329 A:middle L:90%
this description text mhm family seen and to every bolt

111
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:20.290 A:middle L:90%
. Mhm And we got the button and okay,

112
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.449 A:middle L:90%
so we got this heading here as well. So

113
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.649 A:middle L:90%
the way you do heading text is if we go

114
00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:28.930 A:middle L:90%
to the bottom tabs. Navigator in the screen options

115
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:36.100 A:middle L:90%
. We have a tab bar items, style label

116
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:39.710 A:middle L:90%
style and this will be just a style object.

117
00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:45.870 A:middle L:90%
So I think if I did color pink it would

118
00:08:46.039 --> 00:08:49.919 A:middle L:90%
go to pink. Oh not the tab bar.

119
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.210 A:middle L:90%
I think we have is the top bar header bar

120
00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:06.980 A:middle L:90%
. Uh huh. Head a title had a title

121
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.070 A:middle L:90%
style, that's where it is. C. TypeScript

122
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:10.720 A:middle L:90%
is handy. You never have to look at ducks

123
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:16.440 A:middle L:90%
again, would you come out? Think Okay,

124
00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:19.389 A:middle L:90%
so close, very cool. So because this is

125
00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:22.740 A:middle L:90%
the style of this text element, we can set

126
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.820 A:middle L:90%
the font family here. This one family theme and

127
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:35.909 A:middle L:90%
font family regular. And then lastly we have these

128
00:09:36.299 --> 00:09:39.000 A:middle L:90%
mood item rows so we hope in the moonlight and

129
00:09:39.129 --> 00:09:48.440 A:middle L:90%
row we have the mood description. So front family

130
00:09:49.639 --> 00:10:03.039 A:middle L:90%
theme want family, bold and mood date. So

131
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.139 A:middle L:90%
this will be fun family theme, fond family regular

132
00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:17.039 A:middle L:90%
. Who I think we have everything styled. Let's

133
00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.360 A:middle L:90%
see if this works on android. I'm not sure

134
00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:31.580 A:middle L:90%
if the app was actually rebuilt. You go.

135
00:10:31.879 --> 00:10:39.029 A:middle L:90%
So we have this on android as well except on

136
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.360 A:middle L:90%
choose button for some reason. So that's why the

137
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:45.309 A:middle L:90%
reason so here because we've got front weight bold and

138
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:48.539 A:middle L:90%
different family. I think those are conflicting. Yeah

139
00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:51.139 A:middle L:90%
, so that's the reason that like if you're using

140
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.350 A:middle L:90%
one family, I don't usually add a separate fund

141
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.539 A:middle L:90%
. Wait because you can get strange effects. So

142
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:03.740 A:middle L:90%
who moved this? This will work again. Excellent

143
00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.750 A:middle L:90%
. Okay. And another thing, I think we

144
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.929 A:middle L:90%
have some because this fund has a higher line height

145
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.950 A:middle L:90%
than our previous funds. We actually get a slight

146
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:21.139 A:middle L:90%
shift now in the height of this container. So

147
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:28.360 A:middle L:90%
I'm going to remove the padding from kind of where

148
00:11:28.509 --> 00:11:34.080 A:middle L:90%
it was. I think from here, the margin

149
00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:48.940 A:middle L:90%
bottom mm position and then give it a fixed height

150
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.570 A:middle L:90%
. Okay, so we have a container Here and

151
00:11:54.789 --> 00:11:57.080 A:middle L:90%
I want to give it a fixed height. Let's

152
00:11:57.389 --> 00:12:03.610 A:middle L:90%
do 2 40 2 50. Get up to 40

153
00:12:05.539 --> 00:12:09.259 A:middle L:90%
. I'm gonna do 250. And then if I

154
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:15.970 A:middle L:90%
do justify content space between then I don't need the

155
00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:24.139 A:middle L:90%
margin bottoms for the padding anymore. So Mahajan cotton

156
00:12:28.539 --> 00:12:32.399 A:middle L:90%
and margin top. Okay, so now when I

157
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:34.799 A:middle L:90%
totaled between them, they go, so I want

158
00:12:35.179 --> 00:12:38.779 A:middle L:90%
this screen and then this picker screen to be the

159
00:12:38.889 --> 00:12:41.389 A:middle L:90%
same height. So basically what I've done is I've

160
00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:45.539 A:middle L:90%
given the container a fixed height and then I've said

161
00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:48.559 A:middle L:90%
that justify content space between, which means that however

162
00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:52.639 A:middle L:90%
many content items we have just make sure that the

163
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.379 A:middle L:90%
space between them is equal. And then the first

164
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.529 A:middle L:90%
one is at the top of the container and the

165
00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.740 A:middle L:90%
last ones at the bottom of the container. Um

166
00:13:01.129 --> 00:13:03.000 A:middle L:90%
So just so you I think because it was annoying

167
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:03.779 A:middle L:90%
me that it was flickering
