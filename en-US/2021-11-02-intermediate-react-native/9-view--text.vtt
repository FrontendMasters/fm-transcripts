00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.970 A:middle L:90%
now let's do kind of a recap of things that

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.299 A:middle L:90%
you probably already know uh to actually build our mood

3
00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.030 A:middle L:90%
picker. So if you prefer, you can pause

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.589 A:middle L:90%
at the beginning of each section and try to build

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.080 A:middle L:90%
this yourself without looking at the solution. I'm going

6
00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.779 A:middle L:90%
to just code it live. So what were you

7
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.989 A:middle L:90%
first is a list of emojis for you to choose

8
00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.570 A:middle L:90%
from. So to recap the two things we're going

9
00:00:21.719 --> 00:00:23.449 A:middle L:90%
to be using here, mostly our View and text

10
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.210 A:middle L:90%
. So view is the container for to be used

11
00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.949 A:middle L:90%
in styling similar to DiV on the web development and

12
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.329 A:middle L:90%
text is used to display text. So let's use

13
00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.229 A:middle L:90%
this mood option array to display a list of moods

14
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:41.350 A:middle L:90%
in a horizontal list on the homepage. So in

15
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.520 A:middle L:90%
our project next to the screens directory, let's create

16
00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:50.289 A:middle L:90%
another directory. And it's called components. This is

17
00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:52.899 A:middle L:90%
really what components should live. And in the components

18
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.740 A:middle L:90%
directory replicates a new file and let's call it mood

19
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.859 A:middle L:90%
picker dot tsx. And in here I'm going to

20
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.140 A:middle L:90%
copy my mood options for free to change them to

21
00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.950 A:middle L:90%
fit your needs. Um But here are my default

22
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.540 A:middle L:90%
. Let's import react from react. Mhm. And

23
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:28.920 A:middle L:90%
it's still export const picker and react fc. And

24
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.189 A:middle L:90%
let's return she's gonna return a view for now.

25
00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.819 A:middle L:90%
That's important. View from react native and in our

26
00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.090 A:middle L:90%
screens in our home screen, let's import move pick

27
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.700 A:middle L:90%
up from components mood picker. And just render it

28
00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.340 A:middle L:90%
now. In the mood pick out. Let's make

29
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.650 A:middle L:90%
open up this Div And that's to mood options.

30
00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:17.409 A:middle L:90%
Stop map option and that surrender this inside a text

31
00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:26.789 A:middle L:90%
. So the option dot magic. Alright, So

32
00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:29.080 A:middle L:90%
firstly we need to add the psyche. So let's

33
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.039 A:middle L:90%
add a key to be option, thoughts emerge.

34
00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.430 A:middle L:90%
E And now we want this to be a horizontal

35
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.960 A:middle L:90%
list. So we need style sheet for this.

36
00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.759 A:middle L:90%
So we'll import style sheets and at the bottom.

37
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:51.030 A:middle L:90%
Well, kate styles, I'll be still style sheet

38
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.830 A:middle L:90%
dot create and we'll do mood options and let's do

39
00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:05.830 A:middle L:90%
flex direction grow to make them go horizontal and justify

40
00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.740 A:middle L:90%
content space between to be for them to space evenly

41
00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:17.250 A:middle L:90%
here. So for the option container this to style

42
00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.669 A:middle L:90%
equals styles dot mood options. Alright, lastly,

43
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.979 A:middle L:90%
we kind of want this to be at the center

44
00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:29.060 A:middle L:90%
. So let's go to our home screen and use

45
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.669 A:middle L:90%
create another style sheet. Const Yeah, const styles

46
00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:44.280 A:middle L:90%
equals Mhm. Style sheet start to create and container

47
00:03:47.740 --> 00:04:00.840 A:middle L:90%
And let's do a flex one. And yeah.

48
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.639 A:middle L:90%
And then we'll need a justify content center. Mhm

49
00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.919 A:middle L:90%
. Two. Let me put the emerging in the

50
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:11.849 A:middle L:90%
middle. Actually, I think I added the padding

51
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.050 A:middle L:90%
in here Playing Horizontal. Still 10. I said

52
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.310 A:middle L:90%
20. All right. So now we have a

53
00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:26.250 A:middle L:90%
list of emojis and let's quickly have a look at

54
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.850 A:middle L:90%
android and you can see the android emerges are showing

55
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.920 A:middle L:90%
up as well, but they are different from IOS

56
00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.129 A:middle L:90%
emerges. So, one thing to note about emerges

57
00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:36.740 A:middle L:90%
that they will depend on the device, especially on

58
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.259 A:middle L:90%
android. It will depend on the emerging set that

59
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.959 A:middle L:90%
the person has installed
