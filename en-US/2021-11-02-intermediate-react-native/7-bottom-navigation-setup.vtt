00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.673
Let's move on to navigation but
as we'll show we're going to

2
00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:07.812
use bottom navigation so firstly let's
just install the navigation library.

3
00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:10.789
So this is those quite a few packages so

4
00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.360
I'm going to copy this line
open your terminal and right?

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.040
So just to go through what
this is going to install.

6
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.220
So we're going to use react navigation
in the world of react native.

7
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.471
You can pretty much use react navigation
or react native navigation personally,

8
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.612
I prefer react navigation,
because I've used it before and

9
00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:34.640
also that's the one that's
pre built into expo.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.390
So, if you use expo before,
you will be familiar with this one.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.580
And react navigation, they are a mono
repo with multiple packages, just so

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.573
you wouldn't have to for example,
if you only use bottom navigation you

13
00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:50.340
wouldn't also have to
install stack navigator.

14
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.740
So it's just to keep
your bundle size small.

15
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.752
So this is why there's so many libraries
then we have NACK react native

16
00:00:56.752 --> 00:01:00.968
screens which is and which is a library
for managing the actual screens and

17
00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:05.860
it's got built in optimizations to make
sure it's it's as optimal as possible.

18
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.182
On mobile devices, then we have
react native safe area context, and

19
00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:13.758
this is the library that
basically allows you to know what

20
00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:16.490
kind of insects there are on a device.

21
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.906
So for example on an iPhone X, you have
an inset at the top and the bottom or

22
00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:23.170
most android phones, you don't
have an insert at the bottom, etc.

23
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.860
And lastly, it, we're also going
to add the bottom tabs library.

24
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.747
This is this specific library we need to
use to add bottom tabs to application.

25
00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:41.340
Now, if you're building an android app,
there's some additional native code.

26
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.070
Do you need to add not a lot but
I did say that this might happen.

27
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.619
So if you go to android app source main
Java mood tracker and the main activity so

28
00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.500
this is the main entry point for the
application and copy these lines of code.

29
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.608
So let's go Android source, main,

30
00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:06.642
Java main activity and
we need to add this just

31
00:02:06.642 --> 00:02:12.604
underneath our existing
component name function and

32
00:02:12.604 --> 00:02:19.640
we also need to import this bundle
library and add it to the top.

33
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.577
So for IOS remember on android android
kind of handles all the dependencies

34
00:02:29.577 --> 00:02:31.080
automatically.

35
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.490
On IOS,
we need to explicitly install them.

36
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.745
So if we open our terminal,
go to CD, IOS, and pod install.

37
00:02:44.643 --> 00:02:47.750
And you actually see that it's
saying what it's installing.

38
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.962
So these are the libraries,

39
00:02:48.962 --> 00:02:51.920
which we've just installed
that have native dependencies.

40
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.820
So there's usually a pod
file in this libraries

41
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.845
repositories that will
list which dependencies

42
00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:07.760
they rely on now we go cd
back into our main directory.

43
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.354
And the last thing, whenever you add
anything that has needed dependencies,

44
00:03:11.354 --> 00:03:13.580
we will also need to rebuild our app.

45
00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.190
So you can do this via xcode,
or you can do yarn iOS.

46
00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:28.475
All right we have successfully rebuilt
the app now let's do the same for

47
00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:33.847
Android so again on Android you
can either run your Android or

48
00:03:33.847 --> 00:03:38.410
you can always do it from Android Studio.

49
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.300
In this case,
I'm going to run yarn Android.

50
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.875
So one thing to note is that once
you've built native bundle, you

51
00:03:44.875 --> 00:03:49.165
don't actually need to have this process
running all the time in your editor,

52
00:03:49.165 --> 00:03:53.147
because like the native bundle will
stay the same unless it's changed.

53
00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:55.470
And we're not going to be
changing any of the native code.

54
00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.450
So that's why I can pause this
execution on Xcode and Android Studio.

55
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.972
And then just run the CLI tool,
which builds the app once installed it and

56
00:04:04.972 --> 00:04:06.070
then exits.

57
00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.622
So I'm doing this just to save
a little bit of my computer's memory,

58
00:04:11.622 --> 00:04:18.390
so interesting, so it worked through
Android Studio, but not via terminal.

59
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.010
So it could be that it just hadn't had
the time to download the dependencies.

60
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.168
Well, regardless let's move on we
have both of the apps caught so

61
00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.137
we got Android and iOS, cool.

62
00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:38.290
So before we do anything so
this is a plain react native template.

63
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.680
I'm just going to make a couple
of super quick adjustments.

64
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.530
So firstly, we're not going to
be using tests in this course.

65
00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.274
Maybe in another course, so I'm going to
delete the test directory personally,

66
00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:52.416
when I write tests,

67
00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:57.830
I prefer to write a test put the test next
to the thing that we're testing anyway.

68
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.135
But I digress and the other thing is
in Ts config, there is a option for

69
00:05:04.135 --> 00:05:09.060
skip live check and
currently it's set to false.

70
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.737
So I turned this true so
I set this to true so

71
00:05:13.737 --> 00:05:17.888
it doesn't check the node modules.

72
00:05:17.888 --> 00:05:21.594
Because at the moment if you run
the TSC command on this template you'll

73
00:05:21.594 --> 00:05:25.361
get a couple of TypeScript errors which
are due to some of the modules that

74
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:26.720
are installed.

75
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.040
But if you turn this on, it will only
run TSC on the code that you write.

76
00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.490
And lastly, this is just a preference but

77
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.181
I'm going to turn bracket
spacing to truth.

78
00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:44.622
Because I like having
spacing between the brackets,

79
00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:46.490
alright that's it no preferences.
