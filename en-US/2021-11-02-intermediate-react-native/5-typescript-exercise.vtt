00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.565
Now this was a bit of a whirlwind
intro into Typescript and

2
00:00:03.565 --> 00:00:05.870
we have come to a TypeScript exercise.

3
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.790
If you open this TypeScript playground
you should see something prefilled.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.379
All right, so here we have an array
of pets, so we've got a cat and

5
00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.985
a dog and a fish and
we have a type for the pet.

6
00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.232
So here you have an array of pets and
then you have the type of the pet, but

7
00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.615
I haven't implemented the whole type.

8
00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:29.631
So know what you know now using string,
number, optional types and

9
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:32.035
arrays implement the rest of this type.
