Now this was a bit of a whirlwind intro into

2
00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.280 A:middle L:90%
TypeScript and we have come to a TypeScript exercise.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.820 A:middle L:90%
Now if you open this TypeScript playground, you should

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.089 A:middle L:90%
see something pre filled. Alright, so here we

5
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.910 A:middle L:90%
have an array of pets, so we got a

6
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.179 A:middle L:90%
cat and a dog in a fish and we have

7
00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.679 A:middle L:90%
a type for the pet. So here you have

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.920 A:middle L:90%
an array of pets and then you have the type

9
00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:24.989 A:middle L:90%
of the pet, but I haven't implemented the whole

10
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.969 A:middle L:90%
type, so knowing what you know. Now,

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.140 A:middle L:90%
using string number, optional types and arrays, implement

12
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.070 A:middle L:90%
the rest of this type.
