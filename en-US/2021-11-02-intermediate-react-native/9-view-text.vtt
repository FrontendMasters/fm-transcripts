00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.825
Now let's do kind of a recap or

2
00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:06.130
things that you probably already know
to actually build our mood picker.

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.971
So if you prefer, you can pause at
the beginning of each section and

4
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:11.950
try to build this yourself
without looking at the solution.

5
00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.070
I'm going to just call it home.

6
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.460
So what we need first is a list
of emojis for you to choose from.

7
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.841
So to recap the the two things we're going
to be using here mostly are view and

8
00:00:24.841 --> 00:00:29.387
text, so view is the container for
to be used and styling similar to dev

9
00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:33.240
on the web development and
text is used to display text.

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.564
So, let's use this mood
option array to display

11
00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:41.090
a list of moods in a horizontal
list on the homepage.

12
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.762
So in our project next to this means
directory let's create a another directory

13
00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:47.585
and let's call it component.

14
00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:52.540
This component should live.

15
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.027
And in the component strategy, let's get
a new file and lets call it mood picker.

16
00:01:00.622 --> 00:01:04.379
And in here,
I'm going to copy my mood options for

17
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.150
free to change them to fit your needs.

18
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.480
But here are my defaults.

19
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.210
Let's import react from react.

20
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.426
And let's do export const mood picker and

21
00:01:24.426 --> 00:01:29.014
react FC And

22
00:01:29.014 --> 00:01:32.440
let's return should go return a view for
now.

23
00:01:37.593 --> 00:01:41.520
Let's import view from React Native and

24
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.424
in our screens in our home
screen let's import mood picker.

25
00:01:50.722 --> 00:01:54.059
From components mood picker,
and just render it

26
00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:05.456
Now in the mood picker and let's make

27
00:02:05.456 --> 00:02:11.740
open up this div and
that's to move options.

28
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.259
Dont map option and let's render this

29
00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:22.612
inside a text so the option.emoji.

30
00:02:26.005 --> 00:02:28.730
All right, so
firstly we need to add this a key.

31
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.790
So let's add a key to be option.

32
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.590
Emoji.

33
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.350
Now we want this to be a horizontal list,
so we'll need style sheet for this.

34
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.252
So looking for style sheets and
at the bottom locate styles will be style,

35
00:02:50.622 --> 00:02:57.800
stylesheets.create, and
we'll do mood options.

36
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.539
And that's to flex direction row
to make them go horizontal and

37
00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:13.010
justify content space between for
them to spaced evenly so

38
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.424
for the option container
that's to style equals

39
00:03:18.424 --> 00:03:25.450
styles.route options All right, lastly we
kind of want this to be at the center.

40
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.180
So let's go to our home screen and
create another style sheet.

41
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.255
So the const, Const styles equals,

42
00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:44.020
StyleSheet.create.

43
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.672
And container.

44
00:03:47.683 --> 00:03:54.684
And let's do a flex one.

45
00:03:58.752 --> 00:04:04.130
And yep, and
then we'll need a justify content center

46
00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:10.930
To make the emoji in the middle.

47
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.713
Actually, I think I added
the padding in here.

48
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.520
Adding const onto a steep ten as the 20.

49
00:04:23.035 --> 00:04:26.884
All right so now we have a list of
emojis and let's quickly have a look at

50
00:04:26.884 --> 00:04:30.474
Android and you can see the android
emojis are showing up as well,

51
00:04:30.474 --> 00:04:32.640
but they are different from IOS emoji.

52
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.620
So one thing to note about emojis that
they will depend on the device especially

53
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.444
on Android, it will depend on the emoji
set that the person has installed.
