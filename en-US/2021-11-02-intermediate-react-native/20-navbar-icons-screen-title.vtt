1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.207
When in doubt with these arrows
refresh because hot reloading and

2
00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:06.892
native module stoned, always mix well.

3
00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:10.432
Cool, so we have got a home icon here, but

4
00:00:10.432 --> 00:00:14.791
obviously it is way too big and
it's a weird color.

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.261
So if you remember here from tab bar icon,

6
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:19.809
we have access to what
color we should use.

7
00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:25.190
And what size, so we can actually
pass these through so let's do color.

8
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.032
And we should probably de
structure the color and

9
00:00:31.032 --> 00:00:35.030
size and passing color and size.

10
00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.670
So now when we move between the tab,

11
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.979
you'll actually notice that it
has an active and inactive state.

12
00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.219
So this is what comes from the color.

13
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.382
So when I go to home is blue, and
if I go away from home, it's great,

14
00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:51.859
which is pretty handy.

15
00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.499
Now let's do the same.

16
00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.560
So for the exercise, basically we're gonna
do the same with the other two icons,

17
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.169
history and analytics.

18
00:01:04.169 --> 00:01:06.579
So to do this, let's copy.

19
00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.919
So this is the list, so this is where
the history tab as communist SPG.

20
00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:17.801
And then go to our icons let's create

21
00:01:17.801 --> 00:01:23.690
a constant history tab and react FC.

22
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.034
Same icon props because
they're in the same file is

23
00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:31.640
actually quite handy to have the same
props as well use for all of them.

24
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.579
So we know what to expect And
let's return.

25
00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:38.789
This SVG.

26
00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:50.800
Cool, so
we want the same default values as well.

27
00:01:53.562 --> 00:01:57.639
Right now we need to convert these so
we already have SVG imported and

28
00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:59.579
we already have path imported.

29
00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.358
And then circle is a new one but
it is a valid SVG element so

30
00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:06.829
all we need to do is imported
from react native SVG.

31
00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.850
And the last thing you wanna do is
also pass in the size and a color.

32
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.390
So we'll do on the SVG,

33
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.157
we'll do with its size,

34
00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:30.160
height, size and color.

35
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.829
Cool so quite history tab for
some reason I'm in history icon.

36
00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.861
And let's export this as well and

37
00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:50.049
let's do the same for the analytics icon.

38
00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.917
So, export const analytics

39
00:02:56.917 --> 00:03:02.359
I can't see icon props

40
00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.115
And we'll return this SVG so

41
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:20.539
let's do the same people says before.

42
00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:25.762
We be covered capital with a path.

43
00:03:25.762 --> 00:03:32.507
And we'll also pass in the width,

44
00:03:32.507 --> 00:03:37.624
size and height, size and

45
00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:41.818
of course the color.

46
00:03:41.818 --> 00:03:46.710
Now go back to button
tabs in our tab icon.

47
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:53.813
We can add the rest so
if boots name is history.

48
00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:57.420
Let's return.

49
00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.340
Stevie icon.

50
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.162
Some reason typescript isn't catching up,
so

51
00:04:08.162 --> 00:04:11.062
let's import it manually.

52
00:04:14.048 --> 00:04:19.664
And if route.name

53
00:04:19.664 --> 00:04:24.930
is, analytics.

54
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.813
Let's return the analytics icon.

55
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.610
And because it's good
to have a default here.

56
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.589
So let's just do return now.

57
00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:50.839
If none of these for
example you added a new tab.

58
00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:00.571
Cool let me just reload this so in
the history icon we need to use fill for

59
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:05.989
the color rather than fill so
if we change this to fill.

60
00:05:05.989 --> 00:05:11.001
And change this to fill that works

61
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:16.552
excellent so now we have three tabs.

62
00:05:16.552 --> 00:05:19.392
And all the work and they change color so

63
00:05:19.392 --> 00:05:24.054
these are the default colors and
you get rid of back navigation.

64
00:05:24.054 --> 00:05:27.829
But obviously you can customize this and
use your own colors.

65
00:05:27.829 --> 00:05:32.763
So let's go to screen options so

66
00:05:32.763 --> 00:05:39.173
I added some default colors for us to use.

67
00:05:39.173 --> 00:05:43.969
Yeah, so
added two new colors to add to our theme.

68
00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:49.216
So we got a blue and
a gray so if we open our

69
00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:54.785
theme again, add these two colors here.

70
00:05:54.785 --> 00:05:59.536
And going back to bottom tabs
to here just before screen

71
00:05:59.536 --> 00:06:02.335
options as part of this object.

72
00:06:02.335 --> 00:06:09.799
We'll do tab bar active color,
active tint color.

73
00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:11.255
It's very memorable.

74
00:06:11.255 --> 00:06:13.819
Let's do theme.

75
00:06:17.592 --> 00:06:23.959
I think this is blue, and
then tab bar inactive

76
00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:30.009
tint color will be
the other color we added.

77
00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:32.150
Just gray.

78
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.759
Color gray.

79
00:06:36.829 --> 00:06:41.429
And this is handy because now this
is set at the screen option level.

80
00:06:41.429 --> 00:06:45.622
So we don't need to worry about what color
it is we know it comes gets passed into

81
00:06:45.622 --> 00:06:50.193
this function And
the last thing we wanna do is we

82
00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:54.489
don't actually wanna show the names of
these tabs because we have the icons.

83
00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:57.180
And they are handy enough so

84
00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.921
we have a property I think it's
called tab bar show label.

85
00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:06.539
And if we set this to false,
then the label will disappear.

86
00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.418
And the last thing you wanna do is we so
by default, these tab titles,

87
00:07:11.418 --> 00:07:14.799
they will be whatever
the tab itself is called.

88
00:07:14.799 --> 00:07:19.626
So we could update these titles to either
display something that you pass into

89
00:07:19.626 --> 00:07:21.269
the screen as a property.

90
00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:26.349
Or like another hard coded value that's
different from the actual name of the tab.

91
00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:31.789
And the way you do that is each of
the screens also have an options property.

92
00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.544
So we get options and
this can either be a function.

93
00:07:36.544 --> 00:07:40.117
Then you get some metadata about
the route and navigation, or in our case,

94
00:07:40.117 --> 00:07:41.431
we don't care about that.

95
00:07:41.431 --> 00:07:45.771
We just want an object and

96
00:07:45.771 --> 00:07:49.290
just call it title.

97
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.190
Today's.

98
00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:01.840
Mood now you can see it holds up dates and
it shows up here.

99
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.028
And we can do the same for

100
00:08:06.028 --> 00:08:11.480
history so let's do options.

101
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.370
And title past moods.

102
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.370
And for the analytics.

103
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:26.905
Let's do options title, fancy graphs.
