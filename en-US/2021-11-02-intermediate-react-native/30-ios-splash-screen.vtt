00:00:00.753 --> 00:00:01.390
All right,
let's move on to splash screens.

2
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.467
So a splash screen is basically the screen
that we show to users while the app is

3
00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:06.420
getting loaded.

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.400
So this can either be a full page image or
an image with a background.

5
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.756
So on Xcode Let's open Xcode and
then go to launch screen.

6
00:00:22.798 --> 00:00:26.737
Okay, so
this is our current launch screen.

7
00:00:26.737 --> 00:00:30.350
And you can see on the left the tree
view of what we're rendering.

8
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.186
So all we want is we want to render
an image at the center with just a blue

9
00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:34.989
background.

10
00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.022
So if we go to our images,
where we had our app icon and

11
00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:42.613
then hit on the plus to
create a new image sets.

12
00:00:42.613 --> 00:00:50.206
You'll see that this creates an image set
and it's expecting three images from us.

13
00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:52.525
So similarly to when we
added images with our app.

14
00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:56.962
So let's just call this splash.

15
00:01:00.074 --> 00:01:02.849
And let's use the same
butterflies from before, so

16
00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:04.559
I need to download each of them.

17
00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.181
So save, save and oops,
go we have this one.

18
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:16.272
The save these in my

19
00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:21.645
downloads directory and

20
00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:26.003
open under studio.

21
00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:29.057
Open this flash image.

22
00:01:29.057 --> 00:01:32.688
Open my downloads and, then just drag and

23
00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:37.477
drop the correct file 2x goes to 2x,
3x goes to 3x.

24
00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:39.678
Now in our launch screen.

25
00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:47.047
We get rid of this text and
we tracker and powered by react native.

26
00:01:47.047 --> 00:01:48.936
And instead we hit on the plus.

27
00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:53.476
And then we search for image.

28
00:01:53.476 --> 00:01:59.432
And we drag the image view
in a central application.

29
00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:03.598
And here on the right we can
choose which image you want so

30
00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:09.757
here our splash image is showing up So

31
00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:13.516
now we want to make sure that our
image is right in the center so

32
00:02:13.516 --> 00:02:16.650
we can make this a bit
bigger who wanted to.

33
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.416
There we go and then make sure the lines
will guide you to make sure that

34
00:02:21.416 --> 00:02:24.300
it's right in the center of your screen.

35
00:02:27.612 --> 00:02:32.516
This works for me, and
now we go to this little triangle.

36
00:02:32.516 --> 00:02:36.876
And this basically helps us
ensure that the image will be

37
00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:40.134
centered regardless of the screen size.

38
00:02:40.134 --> 00:02:43.531
So here, these little lines tell
you how it positions the image.

39
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:48.414
So right now, I think it's
using these sites to make sure

40
00:02:48.414 --> 00:02:51.787
that these sites work on every device.

41
00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:57.262
So instead, so click on these to make

42
00:02:57.262 --> 00:03:04.339
sure that you instead
have this cross enabled.

43
00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.201
So this basically ensures that,

44
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.801
this will be in the same position
regardless of device size but

45
00:03:06.801 --> 00:03:07.375
always be centered.

46
00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.871
So if we go to the View menu
which is this little bars and

47
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:12.829
then we go to the background.

48
00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.460
So and then go to custom so,
this is a bit of frustration

49
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.011
because I can't find a way
to actually enter a xcode.

50
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:23.514
So, what I usually do is I use
the color picker, so here for

51
00:03:23.514 --> 00:03:25.167
example we can see the color
available on our device actually.

52
00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:29.790
Open this here can

53
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.411
use the picker and

54
00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:40.272
pick the right color,

55
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.128
Cool, so now that this is done for
me to do is hit play to build it,
