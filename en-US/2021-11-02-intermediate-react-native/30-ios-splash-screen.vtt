00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.550 A:middle L:90%
All right. Let's move on to splash screens.

2
00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:04.129 A:middle L:90%
So splash screen is basically the screen that we show

3
00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:06.839 A:middle L:90%
to users while the app is getting loaded. So

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.279 A:middle L:90%
this can either be a full page image or an

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.029 A:middle L:90%
image with the background. So on X coat,

6
00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.559 A:middle L:90%
let's open next code and then go to launch screen

7
00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.570 A:middle L:90%
. Okay, So this is our current launch screen

8
00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.949 A:middle L:90%
and you can see on the left the tree view

9
00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.280 A:middle L:90%
of what we're rendering. So what we want is

10
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.729 A:middle L:90%
we want to render an image at the center with

11
00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.530 A:middle L:90%
just a blue background. So if we go to

12
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.420 A:middle L:90%
our images where we had our app icon and then

13
00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.899 A:middle L:90%
hit on the plus to create a new image set

14
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.750 A:middle L:90%
, you'll see that this creates an image set with

15
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.750 A:middle L:90%
its expecting three images from us. The similarly to

16
00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.810 A:middle L:90%
when we added images with our app. So let's

17
00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.659 A:middle L:90%
just call this splash and let's use the same butterflies

18
00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.659 A:middle L:90%
from before. So we need to download each of

19
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:19.010 A:middle L:90%
them. So save saved and I think I already

20
00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.079 A:middle L:90%
have this one to save these in my downloads directory

21
00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.540 A:middle L:90%
and open up to a studio, open the splash

22
00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.750 A:middle L:90%
image, open my downloads and then just drag and

23
00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.500 A:middle L:90%
drop the correct file. So two X goes to

24
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.739 A:middle L:90%
two X three X goes to three X. Now

25
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.379 A:middle L:90%
in our launched screen we get rid of this text

26
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.769 A:middle L:90%
and we tracker and powered by react native and instead

27
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.969 A:middle L:90%
we hit on the plus, let me search for

28
00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:56.799 A:middle L:90%
image and we drag the image view in a central

29
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.489 A:middle L:90%
application and here on the right we can choose which

30
00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.019 A:middle L:90%
image we want. So here are splash images showing

31
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.590 A:middle L:90%
up. So now we want to make sure that

32
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.919 A:middle L:90%
our images right in the center so we can make

33
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.280 A:middle L:90%
this a bit bigger. Who wanted to there you

34
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.719 A:middle L:90%
go and then make sure the lines will guide you

35
00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.590 A:middle L:90%
to make sure that it's right in the center of

36
00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.840 A:middle L:90%
your screen. I think this works for me now

37
00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.639 A:middle L:90%
we go to this little triangle and this basically helps

38
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.270 A:middle L:90%
us ensure that the image will be centered regardless of

39
00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.969 A:middle L:90%
the screen size. So here these little lines tell

40
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.949 A:middle L:90%
you how it positions the image. So right now

41
00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:49.090 A:middle L:90%
I think it is using these sides to make sure

42
00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.060 A:middle L:90%
that these sides work on every device. So instead

43
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.490 A:middle L:90%
so click on these to make sure that you instead

44
00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:00.310 A:middle L:90%
have this cross enabled. So this basically ensures that

45
00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.539 A:middle L:90%
this will be in the same position regardless of device

46
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.180 A:middle L:90%
size will always be centered. So if we go

47
00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.719 A:middle L:90%
to the view menu, which is this uh little

48
00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.780 A:middle L:90%
bars and then we go to the background so and

49
00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.620 A:middle L:90%
then go to custom. So this is a bit

50
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.060 A:middle L:90%
frustrating because I can't find a way to actually enter

51
00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.639 A:middle L:90%
a hex code. So what I usually do is

52
00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.039 A:middle L:90%
used to color picker to here for example, we

53
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.479 A:middle L:90%
can see the color available on our device actually,

54
00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:38.110 A:middle L:90%
yeah, openness mm here you can use the picker

55
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:46.620 A:middle L:90%
and victor I cut. Cool. So now that

56
00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.550 A:middle L:90%
this is done for me to do is hit play

57
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.520 A:middle L:90%
to build it.
