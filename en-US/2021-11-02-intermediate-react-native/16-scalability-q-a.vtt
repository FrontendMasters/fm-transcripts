00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.370 A:middle L:90%
can you ask your the main important things that should

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.089 A:middle L:90%
consider when trying to build a scalable app as far

3
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.060 A:middle L:90%
as like implementing new features and a bigger app.

4
00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.439 A:middle L:90%
I think the core thing to think about is your

5
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.539 A:middle L:90%
folder structure and setting up your app layout to scale

6
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.519 A:middle L:90%
if that makes sense. So for example these things

7
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.190 A:middle L:90%
here so technically I could have for the navigation,

8
00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.480 A:middle L:90%
technically I could have just added everything in one app

9
00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.879 A:middle L:90%
to sex. It would have worked. So the

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.619 A:middle L:90%
reason for pulling all of these out. So each

11
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.700 A:middle L:90%
screen has its own component and each navigator has its

12
00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.939 A:middle L:90%
own component is to make it scalable. Um so

13
00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.060 A:middle L:90%
that's you know, in a production apps in my

14
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.000 A:middle L:90%
current abdomen building, You know, we have maybe

15
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.890 A:middle L:90%
30 screens or even more and because each of them

16
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.329 A:middle L:90%
have their own screen it's easy to navigate between them

17
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.189 A:middle L:90%
and safer components. Kind of having conventions in your

18
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.020 A:middle L:90%
code base is super, super important. So one

19
00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.719 A:middle L:90%
of the things for me is for components, I'd

20
00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:07.879 A:middle L:90%
like to have the component directory as flat as possible

21
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.239 A:middle L:90%
. So you know, there's no nesting of like

22
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.469 A:middle L:90%
, oh these are UI components or like these are

23
00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:17.269 A:middle L:90%
text components or these are button components. It is

24
00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:20.359 A:middle L:90%
completely flat. So if someone gets on boarded onto

25
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.890 A:middle L:90%
your code base they can just look at these components

26
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.769 A:middle L:90%
, they know like what's what's going on in terms

27
00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:33.049 A:middle L:90%
of like scalability for like performance um there's like performance

28
00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:36.689 A:middle L:90%
tracking tools on IOS on x code and android that

29
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.810 A:middle L:90%
can help you like track down memory leaks and long

30
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.390 A:middle L:90%
running processes um in terms of like data management,

31
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.269 A:middle L:90%
one of the things with contacts in particular is um

32
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.489 A:middle L:90%
yeah, basically context will like all the components that

33
00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.879 A:middle L:90%
listen to your context when this context value changes,

34
00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.829 A:middle L:90%
all of these components that are listening to it will

35
00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:07.109 A:middle L:90%
re render. Um So you need to be kind

36
00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.610 A:middle L:90%
of wary when using context of only wrapping the context

37
00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.139 A:middle L:90%
around the parts of the app that needed, but

38
00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:18.840 A:middle L:90%
also it's better to have lots of small contexts Than

39
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.310 A:middle L:90%
one huge 1. Right? So for example,

40
00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:26.159 A:middle L:90%
usually you'd have a context um provided just for theme

41
00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.939 A:middle L:90%
NG or just for authentication. So even though in

42
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.210 A:middle L:90%
up in your main entry point, it might create

43
00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.340 A:middle L:90%
this pyramid layout which people like talking about from a

44
00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.129 A:middle L:90%
performance point of view that's better than having one context

45
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.860 A:middle L:90%
that has everything in it.
