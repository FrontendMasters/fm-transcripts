00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.600 A:middle L:90%
uh let's talk about javascript libraries. So because we're

2
00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.280 A:middle L:90%
using react native, we can use both native libraries

3
00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.179 A:middle L:90%
as well as javascript libraries. So one of the

4
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.789 A:middle L:90%
big benefits of react native is that we can leverage

5
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.980 A:middle L:90%
this ridiculously huge JavaScript ecosystem. So not all javascript

6
00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.559 A:middle L:90%
libraries are going to work with react native if that

7
00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:19.679 A:middle L:90%
reference the browser window or if they work with CSS

8
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.410 A:middle L:90%
they won't work with cognitive, but there's still a

9
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.839 A:middle L:90%
huge amount of utility libraries that are compatible. So

10
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.559 A:middle L:90%
one of these is state functions. So I like

11
00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.350 A:middle L:90%
to use state functions for formatting dates. So it's

12
00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:37.039 A:middle L:90%
basically a utility library and it has a lot of

13
00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:42.109 A:middle L:90%
different different helper methods for interacting with dates are getting

14
00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.929 A:middle L:90%
whether data is in the past or the future or

15
00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:48.450 A:middle L:90%
how many days or seconds in between and date functions

16
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.240 A:middle L:90%
has a nice format utility which basically allows you to

17
00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.500 A:middle L:90%
format a date however you want. So let's install

18
00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.759 A:middle L:90%
this library. So I'm going to use Yarn.

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.930 A:middle L:90%
So if you open your terminal and jOHn ad state

20
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.700 A:middle L:90%
functions. So notice that because this is a javascript

21
00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.250 A:middle L:90%
library, we won't need to do any of this

22
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.530 A:middle L:90%
rebuilding of our native app. We just installed the

23
00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:16.930 A:middle L:90%
library and in this case we don't even need to

24
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.239 A:middle L:90%
rerun the packager. It will just work Now let's

25
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.030 A:middle L:90%
make our dates follow the following format. So 29

26
00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.280 A:middle L:90%
sep comma uh Yeah. And then at and then

27
00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.700 A:middle L:90%
at the current time. So if we go to

28
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.900 A:middle L:90%
the format documentation which is here, they have a

29
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.349 A:middle L:90%
reference for how you actually format each of the day

30
00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.959 A:middle L:90%
each of the dates. So let's start with the

31
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.969 A:middle L:90%
simple one. So we want 29 as the current

32
00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.230 A:middle L:90%
day. So let's have a look. two day

33
00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.739 A:middle L:90%
of month. Okay so we just want D Okay

34
00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.009 A:middle L:90%
so in our mood picker. So let's go to

35
00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.830 A:middle L:90%
home where we have our date. So let's import

36
00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:24.659 A:middle L:90%
format. Mhm. From date functions and here we

37
00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:28.110 A:middle L:90%
have our time stamp. Let's wrap this in format

38
00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.949 A:middle L:90%
. So the first argument or format is the date

39
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.590 A:middle L:90%
that you want to format. Could you remove two

40
00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.930 A:middle L:90%
string here? The second argument is the way that

41
00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.240 A:middle L:90%
you want to format. So if I just add

42
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:53.060 A:middle L:90%
this d it's going to refresh So all of these

43
00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.240 A:middle L:90%
say 28 because there's a day today now for the

44
00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:04.810 A:middle L:90%
month let's find month. Okay so we can see

45
00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.189 A:middle L:90%
that this this format will be mm mm So if

46
00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.139 A:middle L:90%
I do space mm I get step so let me

47
00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.469 A:middle L:90%
just copy this or have a reference of what I'm

48
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.789 A:middle L:90%
going to. Okay so we want a okay I

49
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.569 A:middle L:90%
think you just do a comma. Yeah so you

50
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.159 A:middle L:90%
can just have a comment there and then we want

51
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.439 A:middle L:90%
the year. Just look up here. Calendar year

52
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.460 A:middle L:90%
. Okay so calendar year will be for wise.

53
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.330 A:middle L:90%
Yeah. Okay then we want at so to add

54
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.370 A:middle L:90%
arbitrary text we use single quotes. So let's do

55
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.460 A:middle L:90%
that and then that shows up here and then we

56
00:03:55.639 --> 00:04:00.969 A:middle L:90%
want the hours and minutes. So that's why in

57
00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:08.849 A:middle L:90%
two hours. Okay. Hours and two digits.

58
00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:15.229 A:middle L:90%
So that's H. H. And minutes into digits

59
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.250 A:middle L:90%
that's mm. And finally we want the A.

60
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.779 A:middle L:90%
M. Or P. M. And this is

61
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.449 A:middle L:90%
just A. A. So we can add it

62
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.629 A:middle L:90%
to the end and now we get the format that

63
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.649 A:middle L:90%
we were looking for. Now finally we want to

64
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.389 A:middle L:90%
style the mood item bro as per this beautiful design

65
00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.389 A:middle L:90%
. Um So you'll notice that we have an additional

66
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.199 A:middle L:90%
color here. So we use this lavender color for

67
00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:45.040 A:middle L:90%
the dates. So I added the color here on

68
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.939 A:middle L:90%
the theme. So called color lavenders if you copy

69
00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:50.470 A:middle L:90%
this and add it to your theme. Doctor.

70
00:04:50.829 --> 00:04:53.610 A:middle L:90%
Yes. Mhm. And then we can use it

71
00:04:53.939 --> 00:05:00.040 A:middle L:90%
anywhere in the application. So in components let's create

72
00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:09.540 A:middle L:90%
a new file called mood item bro TsX and I'm

73
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.540 A:middle L:90%
just going to copy this file from here. Yeah

74
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.870 A:middle L:90%
and in our home I'm going to update our map

75
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.839 A:middle L:90%
to use the mood item row instead so move list

76
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.649 A:middle L:90%
up map and it's overturned the text. Let's return

77
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.129 A:middle L:90%
a mood item rope. Yeah and let's pass in

78
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.550 A:middle L:90%
item to be the item and don't forget to use

79
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.009 A:middle L:90%
the key. So key is item dot timestamp.

80
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.310 A:middle L:90%
So don't worry about these going off the page.

81
00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:55.839 A:middle L:90%
Tell me about these going off the page. We're

82
00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:02.019 A:middle L:90%
going to fix that later. Let's just remove things

83
00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.000 A:middle L:90%
we don't need and there was a key warning somewhere

84
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.350 A:middle L:90%
So it's saying so there's always the top level element

85
00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.860 A:middle L:90%
that needs to have the key. So because we

86
00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.180 A:middle L:90%
reflected this just didn't have a key. So let's

87
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:24.740 A:middle L:90%
do key equals option dot emergency. Yeah. Yeah

88
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:28.220 A:middle L:90%
. So the key warnings don't show up when you

89
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:31.089 A:middle L:90%
hot reload all the time. So sometimes it's handy

90
00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:36.540 A:middle L:90%
to do a freshly reload to find them. Excellent

91
00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.740 A:middle L:90%
. We got to the end of the UI elements

92
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.430 A:middle L:90%
recap. So now let's talk about how to handle

93
00:06:43.269 --> %!s(<nil>) A:middle L:90%
data.
