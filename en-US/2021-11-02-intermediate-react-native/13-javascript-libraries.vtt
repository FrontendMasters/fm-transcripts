00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.304
Let's talk about JavaScript libraries.

2
00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:06.330
So because we're using React Native we
can use both native libraries as well as

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.612
JavaScript libraries.

4
00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:12.394
So one of the big benefits of React Native
is that we can leverage this ridiculously

5
00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:14.140
huge JavaScript ecosystem.

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.726
So not all JavaScript libraries are going
to work with React Native if there's

7
00:00:17.726 --> 00:00:19.194
reference the browser window or

8
00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:21.821
if they work with CSS they
won't work with React Native.

9
00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:26.759
But there's still a huge amount of
utility libraries that are compatible.

10
00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.816
So one of these is state functions.

11
00:00:28.816 --> 00:00:33.007
So I like to use these functions for
formatting dates.

12
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.145
So it's basically utility library and

13
00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:41.761
it has a lot of different help and
methods for interacting with dates.

14
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:46.168
So getting whether they just in the past
or the future or how many days or

15
00:00:46.168 --> 00:00:47.524
seconds in between.

16
00:00:47.524 --> 00:00:51.890
And these functions has
a nice format utility,

17
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.794
which basically allows you to
format a date, however you want.

18
00:00:57.794 --> 00:00:59.588
So, let's install this library.

19
00:00:59.588 --> 00:01:01.684
So, I'm going to use Yarn.

20
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:06.956
So, if you open your terminal and
Yarn add date functions.

21
00:01:06.956 --> 00:01:11.275
So, notice that because this is
a JavaScript library, we won't need to do

22
00:01:11.275 --> 00:01:15.405
any of this rebuilding of our native app,
we just install the library.

23
00:01:15.405 --> 00:01:18.455
And in this case, we don't even need
to rerun the packager it will just work

24
00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.524
Now let's make our dates
follow the following format.

25
00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:29.996
So 29 Sep, year and then at and

26
00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:34.672
then add the current time.

27
00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:39.348
So if we go to the format documentation

28
00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:44.026
which is here they have a reference for

29
00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:49.287
how you actually format
each of the dates so

30
00:01:49.287 --> 00:01:53.525
let's start with the simple one so

31
00:01:53.525 --> 00:01:57.200
we want 29 as the current day

32
00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:03.963
So let's have a look to day of month.

33
00:02:03.963 --> 00:02:06.604
Okay, so we just want D.

34
00:02:06.604 --> 00:02:10.024
Okay, so in our mood picker, so

35
00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:14.341
let's go to home where we have our date.

36
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:20.905
So let's import format
from date functions.

37
00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:29.871
And here we have our timestamp
let's wrap this in format.

38
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:35.603
So the first argument or format is
the date that you want to format.

39
00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:38.075
Get your remove to string here and

40
00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:42.323
then a second argument is
the way that you want to format.

41
00:02:42.323 --> 00:02:48.236
So if I just add this
D It's going to be fresh.

42
00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:57.397
So all these say 28, because there's

43
00:02:57.397 --> 00:03:03.467
a day today now for
the month that's fine month.

44
00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:07.901
Okay, so
we can see that this format will be MMM.

45
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:12.699
So if I do space and I get Sep.

46
00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:18.028
So I'll just copy this or
have a reference of what I'm going to.

47
00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:26.624
Okay, so I think you just do a comma.

48
00:03:26.624 --> 00:03:29.297
Yeah, so you can just add the comma there.

49
00:03:29.297 --> 00:03:32.171
And then we want the year.

50
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:34.947
Just look up here.

51
00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:35.831
Calendar year.

52
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:40.987
Okay, so calendar year will be full wise.

53
00:03:43.634 --> 00:03:44.231
Okay?

54
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:49.831
Then we want add, so to add arbitrary
text, we use single quotes.

55
00:03:49.831 --> 00:03:52.479
So let's do adds.

56
00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:58.368
An ad shows up here and
then we want the hours and

57
00:03:58.368 --> 00:04:01.995
minutes so let's find hours

58
00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:12.729
Okay, hours in two digits, so that's HH,

59
00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:18.095
and minutes in two digits, that's MM and

60
00:04:18.095 --> 00:04:24.555
finally we want the AM or
PM, and this is just AAA.

61
00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:28.498
So again, add it to the end And now we
get the format that we were looking for.

62
00:04:28.498 --> 00:04:36.971
Now, finally, we want to style the mood
item growth as per this beautiful design.

63
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:39.351
So you'll notice that we have
an additional color here.

64
00:04:39.351 --> 00:04:43.262
So we use this lavender color for
the date.

65
00:04:43.262 --> 00:04:47.648
So added the color here on the theme so
called color lavender.

66
00:04:47.648 --> 00:04:51.708
So if you copy this and
add it to your theme.ts and

67
00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:55.483
then we can use it anywhere
in our application

68
00:04:58.292 --> 00:05:05.249
So in components, let's create a new
file called mood item, for that TSX.

69
00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:13.105
And I'm just going to
copy this file from here

70
00:05:16.017 --> 00:05:21.325
And in our home, I'm going to update

71
00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:27.156
our map to use the mood item row instead.

72
00:05:27.156 --> 00:05:31.344
So mood, let's stop map, and
it's over towing a text.

73
00:05:31.344 --> 00:05:35.185
Let's return a mood item row.

74
00:05:35.185 --> 00:05:37.756
And let's pass in item.

75
00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:41.422
To be the item and
don't forget to use the key.

76
00:05:41.422 --> 00:05:45.185
So key is item.timestamp.

77
00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:55.811
So don't worry about
these going off the page.

78
00:05:55.811 --> 00:06:01.081
We're going to fix that later.

79
00:06:01.081 --> 00:06:05.222
Let's just remove things we don't need.

80
00:06:05.222 --> 00:06:08.174
And there was a key warning somewhere.

81
00:06:08.174 --> 00:06:12.571
So it seems so there's always the top
level element that needs to have the key.

82
00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:17.506
So because we reflected this
just didn't have a key so

83
00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:20.584
let's do key = option.emoji.

84
00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:29.896
Yeah, so the key warnings don't show
up when you're hot reload all the time.

85
00:06:29.896 --> 00:06:32.879
So sometimes it's handy to do
a fresh reload to find them.

86
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.198
Excellent, we got to the end
of the UI elements recap.

87
00:06:40.198 --> 00:06:43.730
So now let's talk about
how to handle data.
