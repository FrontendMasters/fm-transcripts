1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.209 A:middle L:90%
as we're going to vector icons now. Remember all

2
00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.730 A:middle L:90%
this kind of hassle that we have to go through

3
00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:09.400 A:middle L:90%
to have really crisp local images for our users.

4
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.839 A:middle L:90%
We need to have three different files of different sizes

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.429 A:middle L:90%
and we need to package them with your app and

6
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.510 A:middle L:90%
then all the users have to download them. It's

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.609 A:middle L:90%
a nightmare. Well, vector icons amazing on the

8
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.019 A:middle L:90%
web. Amazing. On native. So I use

9
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.719 A:middle L:90%
vector icons a lot. If it's possible, I'll

10
00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.089 A:middle L:90%
make it into an extra icon. So vector icons

11
00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.730 A:middle L:90%
are small. They use vectors, which means that

12
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.250 A:middle L:90%
they scale automatically. You don't need to have um

13
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.609 A:middle L:90%
several versions of the same same icon and also you

14
00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.070 A:middle L:90%
can customize them so you can change the color of

15
00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.859 A:middle L:90%
your path or you can change the color of um

16
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.320 A:middle L:90%
the whole vector or part of it programmatically the super

17
00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:48.090 A:middle L:90%
handy. I used them in pretty much all of

18
00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.340 A:middle L:90%
my projects. So I so there are plenty of

19
00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:58.039 A:middle L:90%
resources for finding icons. One that I use quite

20
00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.890 A:middle L:90%
frequently is called flat icon. And basically there's a

21
00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:04.340 A:middle L:90%
bunch of free icons here. They require attribution though

22
00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.180 A:middle L:90%
. Um if you so you can use them for

23
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.790 A:middle L:90%
personal commercial use but you have to give attribution if

24
00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.379 A:middle L:90%
you if you don't have pro license. So just

25
00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:14.560 A:middle L:90%
a caveat there. But if you're looking for just

26
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:18.239 A:middle L:90%
uh icons projects, that's a good resource. So

27
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.439 A:middle L:90%
, I've chosen three icons from here already and you

28
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.200 A:middle L:90%
guessed it. We have a library for this.

29
00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:28.079 A:middle L:90%
So for rendering spG is we're going to use react

30
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.629 A:middle L:90%
native SpG. So playing stds won't just work.

31
00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:34.250 A:middle L:90%
Maybe I can get you. Unfortunately, we do

32
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.900 A:middle L:90%
need a library. Mhm. So let's install it

33
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.939 A:middle L:90%
. So let's copy their, install command in your

34
00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.030 A:middle L:90%
terminal and paste it. So this one does have

35
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.590 A:middle L:90%
native modules. So we need to also Ronnie anne

36
00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:52.040 A:middle L:90%
store, rebuilt, it was rebuilt android, so

37
00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.310 A:middle L:90%
see the IOS. Mhm. But it's still she's

38
00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:07.170 A:middle L:90%
going to stop and we start android. If you're

39
00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.030 A:middle L:90%
a react native developer, you get to be like

40
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.439 A:middle L:90%
the, you know, the XK C D comic

41
00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.110 A:middle L:90%
where your boss is like, what are you doing

42
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.289 A:middle L:90%
? Because your sword fighting and you feel like I'm

43
00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.310 A:middle L:90%
compiling it's the same. You're like, I'm installing

44
00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:24.909 A:middle L:90%
native modules. All right. So, we'll see

45
00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.590 A:middle L:90%
you back into the root directory and run IOS.

46
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.319 A:middle L:90%
So let's have a look at the A P I

47
00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.740 A:middle L:90%
for rec Native spg and how it works. So

48
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.919 A:middle L:90%
, to add an SVg icon, so stds generally

49
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.719 A:middle L:90%
looks like this. So you have an spg,

50
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.870 A:middle L:90%
it has some width and height, it has a

51
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.280 A:middle L:90%
view box and then basically the view box tells the

52
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.520 A:middle L:90%
spg like how to render the path and you have

53
00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:51.319 A:middle L:90%
various um like SVG elements, you can have a

54
00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.639 A:middle L:90%
path to circle, a group, etcetera. Now

55
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.580 A:middle L:90%
on the web, like Suggs will look like this

56
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.240 A:middle L:90%
with a lower case. The same the same way

57
00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.340 A:middle L:90%
we have Div and paragraph and et cetera. Um

58
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.900 A:middle L:90%
for react native SVg. Actually, all we need

59
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.789 A:middle L:90%
to do to convert this spg to be rendered using

60
00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:16.030 A:middle L:90%
react native SVg is use the SpG and Path and

61
00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.080 A:middle L:90%
such elements from here and they're super easy to find

62
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.159 A:middle L:90%
because it's basically on the web is SVG with a

63
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.669 A:middle L:90%
lower case and then the export will be exactly the

64
00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.629 A:middle L:90%
same thing with the capital because it's a rare component

65
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.990 A:middle L:90%
. So to convert this into a react native version

66
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.289 A:middle L:90%
will basically um replace these, we'll give it a

67
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.289 A:middle L:90%
width and a height and we'll also give it a

68
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.189 A:middle L:90%
fill color. Let's see if this is finished.

69
00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.530 A:middle L:90%
No, it's not. But I guess I can

70
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.169 A:middle L:90%
do this anyway. So I'm going to copy this

71
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.939 A:middle L:90%
sPG file and go back to our project and in

72
00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.580 A:middle L:90%
components. So it's up to you whether you have

73
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.129 A:middle L:90%
one file per SVg or whether you have all spG

74
00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.030 A:middle L:90%
is in one file is completely your preference in this

75
00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.460 A:middle L:90%
case I'm going to do one file per. Sorry

76
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.750 A:middle L:90%
, I'm going to do one file and put all

77
00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.709 A:middle L:90%
the way through these in there. So in components

78
00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.589 A:middle L:90%
, let's do a new file, call it icons

79
00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.199 A:middle L:90%
that tsx and here let's import react from react.

80
00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:35.029 A:middle L:90%
And let's do home icon. We act at sea

81
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.629 A:middle L:90%
. It's an arrow function and you will return,

82
00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.310 A:middle L:90%
I'm going to paste the spG that I've just copied

83
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.639 A:middle L:90%
in here. Now this isn't valid yet. So

84
00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:55.139 A:middle L:90%
I need to import spG and Path from Canadian spg

85
00:04:57.939 --> 00:05:00.100 A:middle L:90%
and then allow me to do is replace these with

86
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.889 A:middle L:90%
the upper case versions. And also export this though

87
00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.649 A:middle L:90%
, I should can be used. And now the

88
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.870 A:middle L:90%
last thing that I always do with my icons is

89
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.269 A:middle L:90%
I give them properties for the size and the color

90
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.230 A:middle L:90%
in this case I always want square icons which is

91
00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:24.490 A:middle L:90%
what we want for our bottom tabs. Um but

92
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.639 A:middle L:90%
otherwise you could have within height separate separate but because

93
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.399 A:middle L:90%
I know what you want to square, I'm going

94
00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:33.199 A:middle L:90%
to just use the size. So that's two type

95
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.519 A:middle L:90%
icon props. So we want a size which is

96
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.040 A:middle L:90%
optional because we're going to give it a default and

97
00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.569 A:middle L:90%
let's have it a number and color which is also

98
00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:56.209 A:middle L:90%
optional and it will be a string hit let's say

99
00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.800 A:middle L:90%
plus icon props into reactive C and let's restructure them

100
00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:09.100 A:middle L:90%
so well this size let's default to 40 and color

101
00:06:11.019 --> 00:06:14.379 A:middle L:90%
. That's default to teal. I will send a

102
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.170 A:middle L:90%
tail now the size so at the top level of

103
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.009 A:middle L:90%
the S P G you have a width and height

104
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.649 A:middle L:90%
. So I'm going to use size for both of

105
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.250 A:middle L:90%
them. So with size and height, size.

106
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.629 A:middle L:90%
And then lastly I'm going to add the field color

107
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.779 A:middle L:90%
so Phil equals color. I'm going to render it

108
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.319 A:middle L:90%
on the homepage just to see that something is working

109
00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:51.389 A:middle L:90%
. So home icon. Yeah. Where is it

110
00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.790 A:middle L:90%
is he not rebuilt? Should be. Oh there

111
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.839 A:middle L:90%
it is. I still go home icon here And

112
00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:07.839 A:middle L:90%
if I do size, let's do 100. It's

113
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.509 A:middle L:90%
massive and then if I do color make it pink

114
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.980 A:middle L:90%
, it turns to pink. So basically you can

115
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.470 A:middle L:90%
now change this icon however you want, which is

116
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.029 A:middle L:90%
super handy. All right, so what we actually

117
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.240 A:middle L:90%
want to do is we want to use this icon

118
00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.759 A:middle L:90%
for our home tab. So the way we do

119
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:32.740 A:middle L:90%
that move it from here and let's open our bottom

120
00:07:33.339 --> 00:07:37.529 A:middle L:90%
tabs. Navigator, so just have Navigator will have

121
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:46.839 A:middle L:90%
a screen options prop which takes an arrow function.

122
00:07:51.040 --> 00:08:00.180 A:middle L:90%
Men this uh and here we have tab icon.

123
00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:08.610 A:middle L:90%
Okay, and then this will be a function and

124
00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:15.939 A:middle L:90%
then I think here let's return text. Yeah I

125
00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:18.870 A:middle L:90%
don't usually type this type this out live so it's

126
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:25.540 A:middle L:90%
fun to find the exact ap text from. Okay

127
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:28.899 A:middle L:90%
sir. Okay, cool, awesome. So this

128
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:32.000 A:middle L:90%
actually works. So not that I'm surprised I shouldn't

129
00:08:32.259 --> 00:08:34.529 A:middle L:90%
be surprised. It works. Um Cool, so

130
00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:37.889 A:middle L:90%
you can see that whatever I pass in here on

131
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.419 A:middle L:90%
the tab icon gets rendered on top so what we

132
00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:45.799 A:middle L:90%
really want to do is you want to get access

133
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.649 A:middle L:90%
to what route we're in and then based on that

134
00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:53.840 A:middle L:90%
we want to render the correct tab. So okay

135
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.679 A:middle L:90%
, so terribly icon so I'm not looking at the

136
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:58.809 A:middle L:90%
E P. I right now, I'm just looking

137
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.250 A:middle L:90%
at the TypeScript types just to remind me what the

138
00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:05.629 A:middle L:90%
actual properties are called. So this tab icon,

139
00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:09.330 A:middle L:90%
it knows whether it's currently focused what color should be

140
00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:11.379 A:middle L:90%
and what size it should be. So we said

141
00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.019 A:middle L:90%
that globally rather than within each icon which is nice

142
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.350 A:middle L:90%
and then screen options. Okay, cool. So

143
00:09:18.639 --> 00:09:23.059 A:middle L:90%
this gives me root and navigation so I should get

144
00:09:23.179 --> 00:09:28.570 A:middle L:90%
access to the root here. Cool. And then

145
00:09:29.539 --> 00:09:32.509 A:middle L:90%
root name. Okay, cool. So I'll do

146
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.389 A:middle L:90%
let's pass, let's do the root name here.

147
00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:47.139 A:middle L:90%
So we'll just print out this or the text root

148
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.179 A:middle L:90%
dot name. So this is the name that we

149
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:53.149 A:middle L:90%
gave each of our roots and then we can use

150
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.149 A:middle L:90%
our route name to render the correct icon. So

151
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:59.600 A:middle L:90%
we'll do use a switch statement here, but I'm

152
00:09:59.679 --> 00:10:01.480 A:middle L:90%
just going to keep it keep it simple with an

153
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:08.769 A:middle L:90%
if if root dot name equals home, then let's

154
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:17.049 A:middle L:90%
render home icon and then otherwise we'll just return the

155
00:10:17.169 --> 00:10:17.899 A:middle L:90%
route that name.
