WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.120 A:middle L:90%
Okay. So the first thing we do with any

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.900 A:middle L:90%
project is we create a new folder for the source

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.240 A:middle L:90%
. So let's call create a source directory. And

4
00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.730 A:middle L:90%
next let's move our app tsx into the source directory

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.879 A:middle L:90%
. So let's start by deleting everything abdel TsX and

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.210 A:middle L:90%
let's start from scratch. So let's import react from

7
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:36.090 A:middle L:90%
react. And that's export. Const uh so we'll

8
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.070 A:middle L:90%
use the TypeScript typing. So we'll do react dot

9
00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.710 A:middle L:90%
fc and we'll make this into an arrow function.

10
00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:49.299 A:middle L:90%
And let's return a you one nice thing with TypeScript

11
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.990 A:middle L:90%
is if you use TypeScript and venus code, which

12
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.740 A:middle L:90%
has amazing TypeScript support, you will get auto imports

13
00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.439 A:middle L:90%
. You don't have to add a lot of imports

14
00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.000 A:middle L:90%
yourself. Mhm. Mhm Cool. And I'm going

15
00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.640 A:middle L:90%
to do a const Styles at the bottom. Let's

16
00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:18.439 A:middle L:90%
do style sheet. Don't create nostalgic got imported from

17
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.319 A:middle L:90%
react native automatically. Let's just have a container And

18
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.159 A:middle L:90%
I'm going to make it for with so flex one

19
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.609 A:middle L:90%
and I'm gonna give it a background color of two

20
00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.959 A:middle L:90%
. Let's do on the view and I still style

21
00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:46.849 A:middle L:90%
equals styles dot container. Right. The last thing

22
00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.040 A:middle L:90%
we need to do is update the import for up

23
00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:54.040 A:middle L:90%
. So if you go to index Js, you

24
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.590 A:middle L:90%
might have not noticed. But previously in a template

25
00:01:57.269 --> 00:02:00.939 A:middle L:90%
after TsX has a default export but we've changed it

26
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.450 A:middle L:90%
to a named export. So here we are where

27
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.409 A:middle L:90%
we import up. We just need to de structure

28
00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:10.319 A:middle L:90%
it from the export. So when we say that

29
00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.439 A:middle L:90%
you should have a full screen teal background. You

30
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.599 A:middle L:90%
could previously did my intro to react native course.

31
00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:21.620 A:middle L:90%
You'll notice that the way for structuring the ap files

32
00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:23.879 A:middle L:90%
a little bit different. So we're not we're using

33
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.560 A:middle L:90%
named exports instead of default exports. And this is

34
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.719 A:middle L:90%
kind of a convenience thing because you're guaranteed to know

35
00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.830 A:middle L:90%
what your export is going to be called because it's

36
00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.580 A:middle L:90%
a default export. You can technically call it anything

37
00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:37.919 A:middle L:90%
you could have, you could have typos. It's

38
00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.150 A:middle L:90%
hard to re factor them. So the current modern

39
00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:44.599 A:middle L:90%
convention used to have named exports. And that's what

40
00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.300 A:middle L:90%
we're going to be doing throughout this course. All

41
00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.479 A:middle L:90%
right. So in our source directory, let's create

42
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.939 A:middle L:90%
a new folder and let's call it screens. So

43
00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.669 A:middle L:90%
this we're going to put all of our screens in

44
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.099 A:middle L:90%
and let's create a new file. Let's call it

45
00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.159 A:middle L:90%
home dot screen dot tsx. So the dot screen

46
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.150 A:middle L:90%
part is just a convention. I like to you

47
00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.080 A:middle L:90%
just to tell myself that this file is a screen

48
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.689 A:middle L:90%
without having to go into it here, let's import

49
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:16.810 A:middle L:90%
react from react an export. Const home react fc

50
00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.250 A:middle L:90%
. And we'll make it an arrow function. And

51
00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:30.250 A:middle L:90%
let's just return a view with some text and this

52
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:36.139 A:middle L:90%
call it home. It's important text from react native

53
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.689 A:middle L:90%
. All right. And let's do the same for

54
00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.770 A:middle L:90%
our history tab. So in the screen directory will

55
00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.680 A:middle L:90%
do a new file and history dot screen dot csx

56
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.259 A:middle L:90%
. And I'm going to copy the contents of the

57
00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:55.139 A:middle L:90%
home file and just rename home to history. Okay

58
00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.810 A:middle L:90%
. All right. So now we need a navigator

59
00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.909 A:middle L:90%
. So let's add another file and call it bottom

60
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:10.439 A:middle L:90%
tabs. Yeah. Dot navigator dot tsx. And

61
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:19.170 A:middle L:90%
here will the const bottom tabs equals create bottom tab

62
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.250 A:middle L:90%
navigator. And so this is also imported from react

63
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.850 A:middle L:90%
navigation. Bottom tabs. We're going to do const

64
00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.930 A:middle L:90%
, we're going to export the components and we're going

65
00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:39.759 A:middle L:90%
to export const autumn tabs, uh, react fc

66
00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:46.740 A:middle L:90%
. So don't forget to import, react, connect

67
00:04:49.019 --> 00:04:50.800 A:middle L:90%
and we'll make this into an arrow function as well

68
00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:55.579 A:middle L:90%
. I'm going to return and we're going to use

69
00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:59.680 A:middle L:90%
this bottom tabs that we just created. So let's

70
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:04.100 A:middle L:90%
do bottom tabs dot so we have a navigator.

71
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.610 A:middle L:90%
So there's a four bottom tab is always a one

72
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:12.279 A:middle L:90%
top level navigator. And then as Children we will

73
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:17.230 A:middle L:90%
do bottom tabs dot screen and this is where we

74
00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:20.290 A:middle L:90%
pass in our screen. So the screen has a

75
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.050 A:middle L:90%
name, this is what we call it. We

76
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.040 A:middle L:90%
wanted to navigate to it. Just go home and

77
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:32.209 A:middle L:90%
a component. And first it is our home tab

78
00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:37.639 A:middle L:90%
. Yeah, we'll call this bottom tabs navigator as

79
00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.209 A:middle L:90%
the export of course. So now we have the

80
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.009 A:middle L:90%
navigator and we have at the home screen let's also

81
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:51.399 A:middle L:90%
add our history screen. So yeah, at the

82
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:54.740 A:middle L:90%
history screen to the import, then copy this bottom

83
00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:03.050 A:middle L:90%
stab screen, call it history. Excellent. And

84
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.670 A:middle L:90%
lastly we need to use this bottom tab navigator in

85
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.779 A:middle L:90%
our entry points to interrupt abdel tsx. So in

86
00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:15.350 A:middle L:90%
after csx, remove the view that we had and

87
00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:20.310 A:middle L:90%
let's instead return a navigation container. So this is

88
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.290 A:middle L:90%
an import from react navigation. So this will be

89
00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.949 A:middle L:90%
wrapped at the very top of europe. So this

90
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.350 A:middle L:90%
is like all the navigation is inside this navigation container

91
00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:36.439 A:middle L:90%
. And in here we'll do a bottom tabs Navigator

92
00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:40.910 A:middle L:90%
, which is the import from screens that we just

93
00:06:41.079 --> 00:06:46.470 A:middle L:90%
created is a quick question of why you prefer exporting

94
00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.920 A:middle L:90%
Const instead of exporting default in your modules firstly make

95
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.269 A:middle L:90%
sure you're factoring easier. And also it makes it

96
00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.339 A:middle L:90%
so you have a consistent like name style. Um

97
00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:04.050 A:middle L:90%
so okay, so for example, if I exported

98
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.610 A:middle L:90%
this as default, so if I did export,

99
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.379 A:middle L:90%
default, you know something then if I import there's

100
00:07:13.579 --> 00:07:18.639 A:middle L:90%
something in here, I could do import anything.

101
00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:24.829 A:middle L:90%
So I could name this anything. So it's not

102
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.819 A:middle L:90%
guaranteed to be consistent. Whereas if we export it

103
00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:29.990 A:middle L:90%
as a constant, as a named export, I

104
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.540 A:middle L:90%
don't have a choice but to use this. I

105
00:07:32.829 --> 00:07:35.019 A:middle L:90%
mean obviously I could alias it to something else,

106
00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:36.980 A:middle L:90%
but usually if you wanted to for example, rename

107
00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:39.290 A:middle L:90%
something in your code base, it becomes easier to

108
00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:46.540 A:middle L:90%
find. So it's just a convention. Cool.

109
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.060 A:middle L:90%
Obviously if you prefer default exports go for it,

110
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.980 A:middle L:90%
uh we can all have opinions in JavaScript that's for

111
00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:56.819 A:middle L:90%
sure. Alright, so now we've now that we've

112
00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:59.050 A:middle L:90%
saved this, let's just remove the code we don't

113
00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.439 A:middle L:90%
need anymore. We have a bottom town navigator.

114
00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:06.060 A:middle L:90%
So we have a home tab and we have a

115
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:17.189 A:middle L:90%
history tab and the they work and cops and the

116
00:08:17.269 --> 00:08:19.149 A:middle L:90%
same thing is working on android. So we have

117
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:31.379 A:middle L:90%
our history tab and our home tab and this is

118
00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:33.409 A:middle L:90%
basically how you make a bottom navigator. So if

119
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:36.100 A:middle L:90%
you use that navigators before you can always nest them

120
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.330 A:middle L:90%
. So for example if in your home tab there

121
00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.409 A:middle L:90%
are several screens then this component, which at the

122
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:44.690 A:middle L:90%
moment is just a one JavaScript Well when JavaScript screens

123
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.799 A:middle L:90%
could be a stag navigator instead or another bottom navigator

124
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.639 A:middle L:90%
. So basically that's how the nesting works within um

125
00:08:53.740 --> 00:09:02.789 A:middle L:90%
react navigation. All right, next up, let's

126
00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:08.399 A:middle L:90%
add a third tab for analytics. So to do

127
00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:11.340 A:middle L:90%
that in screens, let's create a new file the

128
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.519 A:middle L:90%
same as we did with home in history and call

129
00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:20.480 A:middle L:90%
it analytics dot screen 36. And I'm going to

130
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.049 A:middle L:90%
again copy the content of our home and paste it

131
00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:28.840 A:middle L:90%
here and just rename this to analytics. And in

132
00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:32.750 A:middle L:90%
our bottom tabs navigator we want to import our genetic

133
00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:39.730 A:middle L:90%
screen And also add another bottom tab screen to it

134
00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:42.620 A:middle L:90%
. So we need name analytics and component 96.

135
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.529 A:middle L:90%
Is there a limit to how many navigation items you

136
00:09:46.629 --> 00:09:51.039 A:middle L:90%
can have there isn't it's just kind of a it's

137
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.529 A:middle L:90%
just kind of a tree view. It's like,

138
00:09:53.769 --> 00:09:55.940 A:middle L:90%
you know, is there a limit to um,

139
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.000 A:middle L:90%
you know, how many days you can have in

140
00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.340 A:middle L:90%
html. It's kind of like you can have as

141
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.600 A:middle L:90%
many as you want, presumably if you had thousands

142
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.350 A:middle L:90%
there would be some performance uh implications. But there

143
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.110 A:middle L:90%
isn't a limit. Um how about the tab bar

144
00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:14.919 A:middle L:90%
, is there a limit on the bottom tab bar

145
00:10:15.259 --> 00:10:18.159 A:middle L:90%
? How many? Um, that is a good

146
00:10:18.299 --> 00:10:22.610 A:middle L:90%
question. Let's have a look. So, so

147
00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.730 A:middle L:90%
really, what needs to be unique is the name

148
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.039 A:middle L:90%
, So if I create a bunch of them,

149
00:10:27.429 --> 00:10:29.639 A:middle L:90%
uh, I think there's a visual limit. Um

150
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.769 A:middle L:90%
, so like there would just be spaced evenly obviously

151
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:35.659 A:middle L:90%
. So now I've added a bunch of them and

152
00:10:35.789 --> 00:10:37.610 A:middle L:90%
it's just not not going to look sensible. So

153
00:10:38.149 --> 00:10:41.879 A:middle L:90%
I think realistically you wouldn't really have any more than

154
00:10:42.539 --> 00:10:46.009 A:middle L:90%
four. Well, five I think So far dad

155
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.570 A:middle L:90%
, I guess if I had five days just about

156
00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:52.960 A:middle L:90%
works. But usually most apps have between 333 and

157
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.799 A:middle L:90%
four. How about stacked navigation? Like to bottom

158
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:03.909 A:middle L:90%
bars? Could that be a potential uh Oh yeah

159
00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:05.149 A:middle L:90%
, I could, you could, you could test

160
00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:07.950 A:middle L:90%
them so I could, well, I can't recursive

161
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.629 A:middle L:90%
. We make this. Okay. So if I

162
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:14.440 A:middle L:90%
did another bottom tabs navigator. So let's do two

163
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.240 A:middle L:90%
. I think it'll work. Mm hmm. Okay

164
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.259 A:middle L:90%
. So I added in analytics three. So I

165
00:11:22.299 --> 00:11:24.389 A:middle L:90%
would expect it to be, yeah, So there's

166
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.299 A:middle L:90%
like a double knave bar. So if you nest

167
00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:28.570 A:middle L:90%
them, you'll just get like navigation inside. So

168
00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:30.669 A:middle L:90%
it's literally just a tree view. So it's basically

169
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.039 A:middle L:90%
saying. So each of these components you can treat

170
00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.580 A:middle L:90%
as your abdel tsx like the kind of like,

171
00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:39.580 A:middle L:90%
well what kind of um, each of these components

172
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.850 A:middle L:90%
are like their own, like playground and then anything

173
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.480 A:middle L:90%
you add in here um like will just be rendered

174
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.529 A:middle L:90%
inside. So that's why, for example, if

175
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.840 A:middle L:90%
you need to have full screen models in your app

176
00:11:52.539 --> 00:11:55.649 A:middle L:90%
, they need to be rendered um outside of these

177
00:11:55.889 --> 00:11:58.950 A:middle L:90%
bottom tabs Navigator, Otherwise they get rendered like above

178
00:11:59.330 --> 00:11:59.470 A:middle L:90%
your Naba.
