1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.549 A:middle L:90%
their media queries. So you can size up fonts

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.849 A:middle L:90%
for like tablet display, that kind of thing.

3
00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:09.250 A:middle L:90%
So there aren't media queries um the way you would

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.949 A:middle L:90%
size up front is that you would use the size

5
00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.039 A:middle L:90%
of your screen. So for example there is um

6
00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.600 A:middle L:90%
okay so for example in this theme file um for

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.350 A:middle L:90%
example if you did fund sizes so something that I

8
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.420 A:middle L:90%
always do fund sizes uh for my apps is I

9
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.530 A:middle L:90%
would do fund size 14, just 14 like et

10
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.829 A:middle L:90%
cetera. So you would have Really, I think

11
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.820 A:middle L:90%
80 kind of small business, small as you would

12
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.439 A:middle L:90%
go, so you do 8 12 14 16 et

13
00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.890 A:middle L:90%
cetera. Um And then if you were on a

14
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.509 A:middle L:90%
larger device, what you could do is you could

15
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:05.930 A:middle L:90%
import um dimensions from react native and then you can

16
00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:10.810 A:middle L:90%
use these dimensions. So for example actually do const

17
00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:21.439 A:middle L:90%
screen with is dimensions get well so you can use

18
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.709 A:middle L:90%
this window or screen. Uh I think Windows is

19
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.209 A:middle L:90%
better to be honest. And so oh so this

20
00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:30.969 A:middle L:90%
is where you get the scale as well. So

21
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.859 A:middle L:90%
the so you got pixel density and actually it comes

22
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.739 A:middle L:90%
with a fun scale which I think is a user

23
00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.540 A:middle L:90%
defined property. So you could use this to like

24
00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.640 A:middle L:90%
choose the right front that you would need for your

25
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.739 A:middle L:90%
particular platform. Um and then basically like in your

26
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.549 A:middle L:90%
theme objects when you define it you could say okay

27
00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.709 A:middle L:90%
, so depending on the properties of the user device

28
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.609 A:middle L:90%
, Make these like different. So even though it's

29
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.269 A:middle L:90%
fun size eight so say that you are a tablet

30
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.969 A:middle L:90%
, it would be like eight times, you know

31
00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.639 A:middle L:90%
1.2 um also be that. So you scale it

32
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.419 A:middle L:90%
up in the theme um you know theme file and

33
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.560 A:middle L:90%
that's the benefit of having a theme file because you

34
00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:15.830 A:middle L:90%
changed it in one place and then your whole actual

35
00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:24.740 A:middle L:90%
scale automatically and just in case you didn't know if

36
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.060 A:middle L:90%
you ever need to reference the screen size, there

37
00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:36.020 A:middle L:90%
is a hook which is called um use window dimensions

38
00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.349 A:middle L:90%
. So this is from react native and this basically

39
00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.370 A:middle L:90%
gives you the width and height of the window.

40
00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:48.789 A:middle L:90%
So if for example you need to for some reason

41
00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.379 A:middle L:90%
you need to know exactly how big the screen is

42
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.860 A:middle L:90%
and then like size your content accordingly. You can

43
00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.520 A:middle L:90%
use this as a hook and this is equivalent of

44
00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.949 A:middle L:90%
importing dimensions from react native and doing dimensions get window

45
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.270 A:middle L:90%
dot height or dot width but the benefit is that

46
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.879 A:middle L:90%
it's a hook which means that if for example you

47
00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:13.129 A:middle L:90%
user rotates their phone which means that the width and

48
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.879 A:middle L:90%
height become inverted. This would know about it and

49
00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.060 A:middle L:90%
would fire and then automatically update. Is there any

50
00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.250 A:middle L:90%
way to set global styles? I'm glad you asked

51
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.020 A:middle L:90%
that. So what I do almost always is basically

52
00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.300 A:middle L:90%
in components, I would create a text component.

53
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.090 A:middle L:90%
So usually it would be like whatever the app is

54
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.560 A:middle L:90%
called text so I don't know app text and then

55
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.330 A:middle L:90%
this component would have the font style, we have

56
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.219 A:middle L:90%
the phone style done, I would have the phone

57
00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:49.719 A:middle L:90%
style applied to present what you do import, react

58
00:03:49.990 --> 00:04:04.639 A:middle L:90%
from react and then export const up text um seven

59
00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:13.389 A:middle L:90%
I mean see Cool. And then this will return

60
00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.329 A:middle L:90%
a text and then this should act exactly like your

61
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.480 A:middle L:90%
normal text would so just pass in the text Children

62
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:37.930 A:middle L:90%
so import text. Mhm Yeah, it's mhm Okay

63
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.420 A:middle L:90%
. And then this would have a fun style apply

64
00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.240 A:middle L:90%
to it. And then you can also um add

65
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.550 A:middle L:90%
props, you can you can have this have the

66
00:04:48.709 --> 00:05:00.529 A:middle L:90%
text props um so that text uh text base.

67
00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:04.509 A:middle L:90%
Okay there we go. Text pops I knew it

68
00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:07.160 A:middle L:90%
was an important Okay, so if you give this

69
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.019 A:middle L:90%
the text props right then um it will like any

70
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.930 A:middle L:90%
of the properties that the text has like this could

71
00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:21.740 A:middle L:90%
have as well. So you do Children crops and

72
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.860 A:middle L:90%
then apply it to your text. Right? And

73
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:30.629 A:middle L:90%
where the front comes in. So if I do

74
00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:38.199 A:middle L:90%
a type yeah text type. So this will be

75
00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.209 A:middle L:90%
text props And so this is how you can combine

76
00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.470 A:middle L:90%
types. So you want to use all the types

77
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.959 A:middle L:90%
of text was going to have anyway. And then

78
00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.430 A:middle L:90%
some custom types and then here you can set a

79
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:57.870 A:middle L:90%
font family and um hey, I would usually use

80
00:05:58.269 --> 00:06:03.209 A:middle L:90%
like an o once you could do bold Thank you

81
00:06:03.329 --> 00:06:11.819 A:middle L:90%
there uh metallic. Right, so the component where

82
00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.720 A:middle L:90%
you use it like it doesn't need to know what

83
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.360 A:middle L:90%
exactly the font is called because really in a component

84
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.189 A:middle L:90%
you want to know. Okay, so Boulder's regular

85
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.389 A:middle L:90%
italic or um if you have two kinds of fund

86
00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:25.970 A:middle L:90%
, I think most apps have like to different funds

87
00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:27.819 A:middle L:90%
. So one would be set up in one sense

88
00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.019 A:middle L:90%
they're affecting. It's pretty common. Then you could

89
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.529 A:middle L:90%
say like, like which like style it is depending

90
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.410 A:middle L:90%
on europe. And then you could use the font

91
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.600 A:middle L:90%
family here, let's go where you basically pass in

92
00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:48.319 A:middle L:90%
style. Which so it would need to extend the

93
00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:59.540 A:middle L:90%
styles that you get um start with this. Mm

94
00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.009 A:middle L:90%
hmm caller. Oh yeah, Yes. So you

95
00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:11.649 A:middle L:90%
would need to step back. Thank you. I'm

96
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.389 A:middle L:90%
not saying it's not used. Okay, cool.

97
00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:17.600 A:middle L:90%
Yeah. So here like because the user, you

98
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.449 A:middle L:90%
could set extra styles on this text. The department

99
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.910 A:middle L:90%
style. But then as as well as the style

100
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:32.029 A:middle L:90%
you could say that Oh if um like fun family

101
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:43.339 A:middle L:90%
would be like mhm On style. Mhm wrecked.

102
00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:52.009 A:middle L:90%
You smell. O And here you could get the

103
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.920 A:middle L:90%
actual fun style based on the font family that user

104
00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:58.980 A:middle L:90%
passed in. So if one family he calls,

105
00:08:00.339 --> 00:08:15.139 A:middle L:90%
it's a bold return. Tell me scream. Mhm

106
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.779 A:middle L:90%
I also complete. Isn't working all the time.

107
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:32.039 A:middle L:90%
It's very frustrating. So import team from same.

108
00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:42.850 A:middle L:90%
So theme docked one family build and then you could

109
00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:48.259 A:middle L:90%
apply it if I'm still here. Mm hmm.

110
00:08:55.240 --> 00:09:04.509 A:middle L:90%
Mhm And it's dependencies. Right? Right. So

111
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.399 A:middle L:90%
effectually like this is on high level how it would

112
00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.700 A:middle L:90%
work. And then usually I would add all the

113
00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.450 A:middle L:90%
different properties that I would need. So for example

114
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.789 A:middle L:90%
, for the size, Like like I would set

115
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.759 A:middle L:90%
the sizes that I support in the app. So

116
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.870 A:middle L:90%
I can say you can only do eight or 10

117
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.639 A:middle L:90%
or 10 or 12 et cetera. So this kind

118
00:09:26.789 --> 00:09:28.519 A:middle L:90%
of gives you an api for like all the valid

119
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.980 A:middle L:90%
things, different family size um color like anything you

120
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:35.570 A:middle L:90%
need. So then if you in your app,

121
00:09:36.049 --> 00:09:39.190 A:middle L:90%
when you use text rather than using a text element

122
00:09:39.659 --> 00:09:42.309 A:middle L:90%
and style it, then you would use the app

123
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:45.480 A:middle L:90%
text and then basically would work the same way you

124
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.330 A:middle L:90%
would pass in just a text and the properties.

125
00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:53.059 A:middle L:90%
Um Yeah. And then a goal for me for

126
00:09:53.169 --> 00:09:55.659 A:middle L:90%
this tax element is that you would never need to

127
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.169 A:middle L:90%
pass it style into it. So the idea is

128
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.039 A:middle L:90%
that if you were to use you're up text uh

129
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:08.809 A:middle L:90%
text. All right. So then I could do

130
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:12.639 A:middle L:90%
fun family bold to see that when I did fun

131
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.899 A:middle L:90%
family. It gives me all the options which is

132
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.289 A:middle L:90%
super handy. I don't need to go to any

133
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.549 A:middle L:90%
other file and also size. I didn't pass some

134
00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:25.360 A:middle L:90%
styles size. But the idea is here that like

135
00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:28.690 A:middle L:90%
you should never like ideally you don't have to pass

136
00:10:29.009 --> 00:10:31.659 A:middle L:90%
in any other styles for this text. So like

137
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.379 A:middle L:90%
your one and only app text will will have all

138
00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:35.039 A:middle L:90%
the different variants
