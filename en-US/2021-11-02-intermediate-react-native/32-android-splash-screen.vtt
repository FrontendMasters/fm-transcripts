00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:02.918
Now, let's add a splash screen to Android.

2
00:00:02.918 --> 00:00:07.195
So firstly, we need to create
a image layout for Android.

3
00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:13.892
So if we go to Android app source mean
Rez, we should create a layout directory.

4
00:00:13.892 --> 00:00:18.331
So, Android app source main press.

5
00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:22.530
Let's create a new folder,
and call it layout.

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.879
And then, inside it let's create
a file called Launch screen.XML.

7
00:00:28.879 --> 00:00:31.886
A file launch screen to XML.

8
00:00:31.886 --> 00:00:34.947
Let's just copy this layout here.

9
00:00:34.947 --> 00:00:38.412
Now, you can view this within
Android Studio as well and

10
00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:41.445
it will give you an idea
of what it will look like.

11
00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:46.450
But basically this layout Is
framed as a type of layout, and

12
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.670
it's referencing a couple of
properties we don't have yet.

13
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.210
So we have a background colour

14
00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.755
of splash blue, and a image.

15
00:01:02.755 --> 00:01:05.104
And the image which is
a drawable launch screen.

16
00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:09.414
So in order for this file to reference
these, we also need to create them.

17
00:01:11.418 --> 00:01:18.674
So to add the image let's create
a drawable xxhdpi directory on the res.

18
00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:24.998
So on the wrist let's do a new folder and
paste this.

19
00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:33.122
And then inside this let's save
this butterflies image and

20
00:01:33.122 --> 00:01:38.160
let's call it launch screen.png so

21
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.684
saving the jazz let's do carry projects

22
00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:48.736
we check Android, app source main.

23
00:01:48.736 --> 00:01:52.614
It's very deep folder
structures in Android.

24
00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:55.569
Java, okay, and
let's call it launch screen.

25
00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.684
So the name is important
because in here we're

26
00:01:59.684 --> 00:02:04.229
expecting this to be called launch screen,
okay.

27
00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.625
And then we'll also need to add the color.

28
00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:11.441
So on the values,
let's create a colors.XML.

29
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:15.183
So here and the values we
already have strings and styles.

30
00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:20.710
So in Android all of the strings,
and styles, and colors, anything

31
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.546
you use in your native code can even
XML value as opposed to paste it here.

32
00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:32.887
So we have primary dark and the blue that
we're going to use for our background.

33
00:02:32.887 --> 00:02:35.882
And one thing to know to
the way that we've set this up,

34
00:02:35.882 --> 00:02:39.870
it assumes that you already have
React Native Splash screen installed.

35
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.357
So if you haven't already set it up,
make sure that you've installed and

36
00:02:43.357 --> 00:02:45.447
configured the splash screen for Android.

37
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.979
And we haven't done this.

38
00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:56.745
So here under Android,
we need to update main activity.java.

39
00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:59.233
So let's do that.

40
00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:05.227
So, we go to,
main Java main activity.java.

41
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.453
Will import the bundle and
the splash screen.

42
00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:17.074
And uncreate,
will do splash screen show this.

43
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.923
Okay, so this is a duplicate input
on bundles that can remember these.

44
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:33.385
Excellent, so let's close this.

45
00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:37.418
And let's rebuild from Android Studio.

46
00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:42.252
So I said earlier that you can
actually see the launch screen within

47
00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:43.557
android studio.

48
00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:46.832
So if I open this.

49
00:03:46.832 --> 00:03:48.781
It's currently not happy with me.

50
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:55.431
Okay there it is yeah.

51
00:03:55.431 --> 00:03:59.522
So if I open this you can actually see you
can use a split screen or design screen so

52
00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:01.794
you actually can see
what it will look like.

53
00:04:01.794 --> 00:04:09.063
So it's coded in XML but the preview is
available same as the IOS version is.

54
00:04:09.063 --> 00:04:17.002
All right and then we close this,
I go we got a splash screen.

55
00:04:17.002 --> 00:04:22.705
So I think it's actually
building the Android bundle.

56
00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:27.970
So now, we have our Android and
iOS apps with splash screens
