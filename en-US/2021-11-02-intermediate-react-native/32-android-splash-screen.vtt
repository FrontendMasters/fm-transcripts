00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.940 A:middle L:90%
now let's add a splash screen to android. So

2
00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:06.490 A:middle L:90%
first you need to create a image layout for android

3
00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:08.919 A:middle L:90%
. So if we go to android app. Source

4
00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.939 A:middle L:90%
main rez we should create a layout directory. So

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.929 A:middle L:90%
enjoy app. Source Main. Press let's create a

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.710 A:middle L:90%
new folder and call it lay out. And then

7
00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.559 A:middle L:90%
inside it let's create a file called launch screen dot

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.879 A:middle L:90%
xml. You file launch screen to xml and let's

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.390 A:middle L:90%
just copy this layout here. Now um, you

10
00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:39.020 A:middle L:90%
can view this within android studio as well and it

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.399 A:middle L:90%
will give you an idea of what it would look

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.210 A:middle L:90%
like. But basically this layout is similar to the

13
00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.500 A:middle L:90%
type of layout and it's referencing a couple of properties

14
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.670 A:middle L:90%
we don't have yet. So we have a background

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.740 A:middle L:90%
color. All that spells slash blue and a image

16
00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.939 A:middle L:90%
. First language and the image which is a drop

17
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.629 A:middle L:90%
ball launch screen. So in order for this file

18
00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:08.480 A:middle L:90%
to reference these, we also need to create them

19
00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.260 A:middle L:90%
. So to add the image, let's create a

20
00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:17.280 A:middle L:90%
durable X X H D P I directory on the

21
00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.569 A:middle L:90%
rest so under arrest. Let's do a new folder

22
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.640 A:middle L:90%
and paste this. And then inside this let's um

23
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.930 A:middle L:90%
save this butterflies image and let's call it launch screen

24
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.750 A:middle L:90%
dot PNG. So saving the jazz. Let's do

25
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.670 A:middle L:90%
Katie projects. New tracker android up. Source main

26
00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.439 A:middle L:90%
. It's very deep for the structures in android trouble

27
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.469 A:middle L:90%
. Okay, let's call it launched green. So

28
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.969 A:middle L:90%
the name is important because in here we're expecting this

29
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.530 A:middle L:90%
to be called launch green. Okay. And then

30
00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:07.150 A:middle L:90%
we'll also need to add the color So on the

31
00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.669 A:middle L:90%
values let's create a colors dot xml. So here

32
00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.360 A:middle L:90%
and the values. We already have strings and styles

33
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.039 A:middle L:90%
. So in android, all of the strings and

34
00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:20.699 A:middle L:90%
styles and colors, Anything you use in your native

35
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:25.240 A:middle L:90%
code can't read an xml value. Yeah. And

36
00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:27.800 A:middle L:90%
paste it here. So we have primary dark and

37
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.300 A:middle L:90%
the blue that we're going to use for our background

38
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.139 A:middle L:90%
. And one thing to know to the way that

39
00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.219 A:middle L:90%
we've set this up, it assumes that you already

40
00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.169 A:middle L:90%
have react native splash screen installed. So if you

41
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.930 A:middle L:90%
haven't already set it up, make sure that you've

42
00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:50.039 A:middle L:90%
installed and configured the splash screen for android and we

43
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.280 A:middle L:90%
haven't done this. So here on the android,

44
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.539 A:middle L:90%
we need to update main activity dot java. So

45
00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.879 A:middle L:90%
let's do that. So we go to main java

46
00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.009 A:middle L:90%
. Main activity dot java. We import the bundle

47
00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:14.280 A:middle L:90%
and the splash screen and un create. We'll do

48
00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:20.840 A:middle L:90%
splash screens, show this. Okay, So there's

49
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.340 A:middle L:90%
a duplicate imprint and bundles that can remember these.

50
00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:34.789 A:middle L:90%
Excellent. So let's close this and let's rebuild from

51
00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:39.300 A:middle L:90%
android studio. So I said earlier that you can

52
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.340 A:middle L:90%
actually see the launch screen within android studio. So

53
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.770 A:middle L:90%
if I open this, it's currently not happy with

54
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.949 A:middle L:90%
me. Okay. There it is. Yes.

55
00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.870 A:middle L:90%
If I open this, you can actually see you

56
00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:59.729 A:middle L:90%
can use a split screen or design screens. You

57
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.780 A:middle L:90%
actually can see what it will look like. So

58
00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.960 A:middle L:90%
it's coded in xml? But the preview is available

59
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.680 A:middle L:90%
same as the IOS version is all right. And

60
00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.000 A:middle L:90%
then we close this. There you go. We've

61
00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.100 A:middle L:90%
got splash screen. So I think is actually building

62
00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.759 A:middle L:90%
the android bundle. So now we have our android

63
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.519 A:middle L:90%
and IOS apps with splash screens.
