I got the forum working your job is going
to look at the individual menu item,

2
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:12.860
I swapped out menu items writ large and
the new menu item form.

3
00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.357
Your job is to create a container For
the individual menu item,

4
00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:28.600
and then we're gonna pass it the ability
to remove a individual item from the menu.

5
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.883
Now one thing that I will kinda give
you a hint Because this is a little bit

6
00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:35.050
trickier, than just taking props and
dispatching them.

7
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.138
One thing that I will say is not
only we kinda go back a little bit,

8
00:00:40.138 --> 00:00:47.050
not only is dispatch passed in, but we
have this own props as a second argument.

9
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.710
Own props is going to be cool.

10
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.490
We have the State and
the dispatcher were mapping to props.

11
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.655
But in case other things were
passed into this component,

12
00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:58.910
you have access to those as well.

13
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.010
So own props, I definitely console log and
see what it is for yourself.

14
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.910
But we can make a hypothesis
around what is going to be, right?

15
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.613
If you look at the menu items,

16
00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:12.980
we're taking all the different
properties of the item including its ID.

17
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.954
So if you need to figure out how
to remove a given one from state,

18
00:01:15.954 --> 00:01:17.990
You'll have that on the own props object.

19
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.820
So your job is to basically
we need an action.

20
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.007
We need the reducer logic,
we need to wrap the menu item and

21
00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:29.011
then we need to pass in that property.

22
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:31.679
As the removed prop that is going
to then fire the action and

23
00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.201
remove it from our store.

24
00:01:33.201 --> 00:01:37.696
So why don't we spend 10 minutes and see
if we can wire up the ability to remove

25
00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:41.391
a menu item from the menu, and
then we'll do it together as a team
