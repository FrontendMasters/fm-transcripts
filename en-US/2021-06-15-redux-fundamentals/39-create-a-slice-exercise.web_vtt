00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
We're gonna actually create the human
slice now, which, or replace it so

2
00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.946
that it was expecting mapping on
a rice and giving you an empty one.

3
00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:08.329
So if we go in here and
we look at the state,

4
00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:12.294
because now see that I have the tasks,
they're all loaded in there.

5
00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:16.297
We even have the actions which we'll see
when we get everything to the point,

6
00:00:16.297 --> 00:00:19.745
we can start dispatching some
actions as well, but your job is to,

7
00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:20.928
I made the task slice.

8
00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:26.041
Your job is to go ahead and create a slice
using Redux toolkit for also adding human,

9
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:30.935
so it's effectively very similar to what
we did the tasks where you're gonna go

10
00:00:30.935 --> 00:00:35.829
ahead and do it for adding humans and then
add it into our store with the reducer,

11
00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.977
very similar to how we just did it.

12
00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:41.760
And then we'll take it from there and
get the rest of the application working.
