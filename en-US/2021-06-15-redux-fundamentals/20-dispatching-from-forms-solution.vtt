00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.243
Does anyone want to take me through,

2
00:00:02.243 --> 00:00:06.011
anyone want to treat me like a small
child and tell me what to do?

3
00:00:06.011 --> 00:00:07.670
What are we doing?

4
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.523
&gt;&gt; So first we need some sort of state
to hold the current state of this input.

5
00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:14.111
&gt;&gt; Okay, what should I call of that?

6
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:15.681
&gt;&gt; Let's say useState, for example.

7
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:24.439
&gt;&gt; Good, What should I set it to?

8
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.171
&gt;&gt; Let's set it for 0 for now.

9
00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:30.970
&gt;&gt; 0, I like that, I'm signed on to that.

10
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.030
And you'll call it count?

11
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.219
&gt;&gt; All right, yeah.

12
00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.688
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, All right,

13
00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:44.515
we've got that in place
&gt;&gt; They don't need to wind this value to

14
00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:45.150
the input?

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.650
&gt;&gt; Yep.

16
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:52.875
All right.

17
00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:54.319
&gt;&gt; And kind of only change that value.

18
00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:58.750
&gt;&gt; So whenever it changes, we'll go-
&gt;&gt; And set the count whenever that change.

19
00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:11.010
The target value, All right?

20
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.099
&gt;&gt; And then on submit you need to kind
of dispatch the set action to the store.

21
00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:18.646
&gt;&gt; Call, so I'll call on useDispatch?

22
00:01:18.646 --> 00:01:20.250
&gt;&gt; useDispatch.

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.718
&gt;&gt; So you've got useDispatch.

24
00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:28.051
And when the form is submitted
we will go ahead and

25
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:30.990
we'll dispatch the set of count, right?

26
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.760
And we'll do with the count.

27
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.126
&gt;&gt; That's okay.

28
00:01:39.126 --> 00:01:40.971
&gt;&gt; Awesome, so let's go ahead.

29
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:44.554
Let's change this to, I don't know, 45.

30
00:01:44.554 --> 00:01:45.991
And it works.

31
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:49.111
We've got the ability to
dispatch from a form now.

32
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:54.300
Did anyone get to the little extension,
which is, could I sync these two up?

33
00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.959
Right, cuz it's a little string, yeah?

34
00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:03.799
&gt;&gt; We should pass our state to the initial
state of the set counter component.

35
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.851
&gt;&gt; Whoa, I like this.

36
00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:12.066
So we'll put in that, Initial count.

37
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:15.240
Is that useSelector then?

38
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.004
Cool, so we've got that and
I'll pass it in.

39
00:02:31.343 --> 00:02:38.370
All right, so I guess that gives it
an initial load which will work.

40
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:44.266
The one thing that I did to keep it
up to date, did anyone get that part?

41
00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:45.796
Or I can do the [CROSSTALK] down.

42
00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:48.932
&gt;&gt; You need to have some
sort of useEffect on

43
00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:49.864
it cuz-
&gt;&gt; Yep.

44
00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:54.560
&gt;&gt; Whenever that changed, the whole code

45
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.979
actually update the initial count.

46
00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:06.320
&gt;&gt; So what we can say is useEffect and
we'll say pass in a function,

47
00:03:08.433 --> 00:03:13.380
And we'll set the count
that we made earlier with,

48
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.224
well, let's call this one
count from store now.

49
00:03:18.224 --> 00:03:22.718
Cuz it's not really initial count anymore.

50
00:03:22.718 --> 00:03:26.943
And so here we will set it to,
Count from store.

51
00:03:26.943 --> 00:03:31.762
And we'll do that whenever
count from store changes.

52
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.211
All right, so we've got that in place.

53
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:39.110
So now we'll get it there initially.

54
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.809
And it'll also change whenever
the one in the Redux changes, but

55
00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:48.260
we can also modify it as well and
change it ourselves, right?

56
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.158
So those are some of the peculiarities.

57
00:03:50.158 --> 00:03:51.931
So we've already mastered React.

58
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:54.452
Well, yeah, React II,
we've taken all of the courses.

59
00:03:54.452 --> 00:03:56.379
And we've mastered Redux as well.

60
00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.471
So now the big kind of last mile for
us is all the kind of,

61
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.511
how do they end to actually
interact with each other.

62
00:04:02.511 --> 00:04:07.105
In this case, we can still use components
state to achieve certain features

63
00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:10.046
that we need to achieve that maybe,
just React or

64
00:04:10.046 --> 00:04:13.512
just Redux by itself isn't
necessarily gonna support.

65
00:04:13.512 --> 00:04:18.131
Let's just talk about a few small kind
of refactoring that we could do here.

66
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:21.411
And to be clear, I'm not necessarily
sure that you need to do all of them.

67
00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:23.041
I'm just gonna show you
how some of this works.

68
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:24.660
Mohammed, you had a question?

69
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.304
&gt;&gt; Can we use subscribe for the input,
instead of using useEffect?

70
00:04:28.304 --> 00:04:32.862
&gt;&gt; So subscribe, you would actually
have to have access to the store itself.

71
00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:35.971
React Redux isn't gonna let you
necessarily touch the store.

72
00:04:35.971 --> 00:04:39.739
That's why if you look at that
useSelector, useSelector allows us to get

73
00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:43.710
access to the state, but we don't
actually have access to the store itself.

74
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.619
We have useDispatch to
dispatch actions to the store.

75
00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:49.272
We've useSelector to get
the state from the store, but

76
00:04:49.272 --> 00:04:51.595
we can't necessarily
access the store itself.

77
00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:55.357
But we are getting the fact that
the one thing that we care about,

78
00:04:55.357 --> 00:04:59.549
right, which is the count whenever
it changes, we can use useEffect.

79
00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:01.311
So we don't have access to the full store.

80
00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:02.442
So we can't use subscribe.
