00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.091
All right, so I got the price working,
why don't you

2
00:00:05.091 --> 00:00:10.282
spend about seven minutes to
get the quantity working.

3
00:00:10.282 --> 00:00:13.459
And then we'll take the fact that once we
have the price, the quantity the ability

4
00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.964
add or remove items, all we need
to do is get the totals working.

5
00:00:15.964 --> 00:00:18.815
Everything along those lines cuz in fact,

6
00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:22.420
I already have the tip
percentage update in place.

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.696
So we'll have everything we need
to figure out how to compute and

8
00:00:25.696 --> 00:00:27.490
derive some data as well.

9
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.795
So take a little bit of time, get up
stretch, see if you can implement that.

10
00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:34.090
I'm gonna push up the live coding branch,
and I'm gonna drop a CodeSandbox.

11
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.050
So you can start exactly from my code and
pick up where I left off.
