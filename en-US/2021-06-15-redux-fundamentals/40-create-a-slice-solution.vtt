00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.300
All right, so
in the very beginning our human size,

2
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.345
it'll take some differences.

3
00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:11.811
It'll be a little bit different a little
bit cuz we have this relation between

4
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.490
the tasks and the human but the very
sensitive we're just adding the human.

5
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.680
It's not that much just similar but
let's take a look, so we've got

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.781
this idea of we'll have a create human
helper as well, this one will take a name.

7
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:29.337
If you looked at the component you see
it's not expecting a tile it's expecting

8
00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:30.880
a name in this case.

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.697
And we will return the ID
which is again gonna be

10
00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:40.513
this Nano ID and
we'll call that a function and

11
00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:44.850
the name, and then we'll take task IDs.

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.818
We'll keep an array of all the IDs, and

13
00:00:46.818 --> 00:00:50.471
this is mostly demonstrate one of
the things we've questioned before.

14
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:55.301
Which is like, do actions really
go through all the reducers and

15
00:00:55.301 --> 00:00:59.515
we'll make some initial state,
we will make an array.

16
00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.337
I'll be one, make one for

17
00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:14.725
Mark Welcome Tanner.

18
00:01:22.303 --> 00:01:27.614
Cool, so we've got all of that in place
and now we're just gonna create our slice,

19
00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:39.411
And let's make sure we import that,
with the auto complete there.

20
00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:46.131
Sweet, and
this one is gonna be the name humans.

21
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.197
We'll pass in that initial state and the
reducer is gonna be somewhat similar to

22
00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:57.696
what we had before except we're
gonna use a name instead.

23
00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:04.183
We'll add and
we'll say a state and action and

24
00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:10.181
we will immediately do the state dot push.

25
00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:15.165
Create human with that action payload.

26
00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:20.075
And one of the reasons why we
stuck with the flux standard

27
00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:21.697
actions in the very beginning.

28
00:02:21.697 --> 00:02:22.459
Is because again,

29
00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.635
Redux token is just going to
assume that best practice as well.

30
00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:30.231
We're gonna see that the action creators
are just going to put stuff in a payload

31
00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:33.192
on our behalf,
whether we're ready for it or not.

32
00:02:33.192 --> 00:02:36.553
So let's actually get that into our store.

33
00:02:40.413 --> 00:02:47.791
I don't know why it wants to capitalize
that we'll fix that human dot reducer.

34
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.115
And so now we should actually
have the state in place and

35
00:02:51.115 --> 00:02:55.220
we're gonna see something
kinda interesting in a second.

36
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.709
But if we look, I'll give it a quick
refresh and we've got our humans in there,

37
00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.070
they're all everything is kind
of as we would expect it to be
