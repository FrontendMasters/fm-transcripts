00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.730
All right, now it's your mission.

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.620
Your mission is to go ahead and see if
you can get the total working, right?

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.830
So we did the overall summary, your job.

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.160
And I will push up a branch
on the live coding branch.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.751
I also dropped the code sandbox into
the chat your job is to get the total for

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.400
each menu item and
then we've got a working application.
