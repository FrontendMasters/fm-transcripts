00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.189
So we'll do one more little
exercise which is very similar,

2
00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:04.740
just kind of get our hands dirty.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.680
We've got this idea of fetching
a series of dog facts.

4
00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.987
And so what we wanna do is
just create our async func.

5
00:00:13.987 --> 00:00:17.660
We want to start out with
the loading not present.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.950
Put it up as we go ahead and
try to get our dog facts.

7
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.583
And then upon receiving our dog facts,
we will go ahead and

8
00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:29.643
take down the loading and display however
many dog facts that we need to display.
