00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.146
So, I wrote the log Middleware,

2
00:00:02.146 --> 00:00:05.458
what I want you to do is now
take our enhancer from before

3
00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:10.190
that monitor performance and let's
turn that into a piece of Middleware.

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.129
And then all we have to do is add it to
the supply Middleware as a second argument

5
00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.171
and we should have both in place
now as Middleware instead.

6
00:00:17.171 --> 00:00:18.360
So, I'll give you five minutes to do that.
