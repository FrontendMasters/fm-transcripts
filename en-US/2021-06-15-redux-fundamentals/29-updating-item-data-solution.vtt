00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.101
All right, so
our job was basically to do something very

2
00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:08.842
similar to what we did before, but
we need to get the quantity work.

3
00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.890
And this is kind of,

4
00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.480
we can kind of stand on the spot to
say stand on the shoulder of giants.

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.506
That seems really not okay when I'm the
giant seems like very self aggrandizing.

6
00:00:19.506 --> 00:00:24.698
In fact, let's go with this and
on the shoulders of giants on the giant

7
00:00:24.698 --> 00:00:29.714
this case, update quantity is
simply going to, we'll eventually

8
00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:35.700
have an update quantity action here as
well and it's gonna change the quantity.

9
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.548
It's basically a lot of
the same except we are updating

10
00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:42.970
the price we're gonna do the quantity.

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.400
So actually pop that in as well.

12
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.616
If anyone sees miss type the word
quantity at some point you let me know,

13
00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.900
because that's not outside
the realm of possibility.

14
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.677
So we've got update quantity in
our map dispatch to props and

15
00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:02.049
now we will move into our actions or
again,

16
00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.485
it's very much a little bit the same here.

17
00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:12.479
Where well update quantity.

18
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:21.220
And I'm sure you could get very fancy
here, and make some kind of abstraction.

19
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.648
When things will see in Redux toolkit,

20
00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:26.745
is there is the ability to
kind of like there's a.

21
00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:30.927
You can use this Redux toolkit or
there's libraries that do this,

22
00:01:30.927 --> 00:01:35.034
which will be like create action
where you give it just the name and

23
00:01:35.034 --> 00:01:37.366
it will prepare the payload for you.

24
00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:41.093
Item quantity updated.

25
00:01:44.322 --> 00:01:45.760
As well, so we can put that in.

26
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.345
So, now I've got the action creator,
we're mapping it to dispatch,

27
00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:56.640
we do need to add it into the reducer,
and that should be quantity.

28
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.520
Make sure to,
I knew I was gonna miss it somewhere.

29
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920
This is I'd like to say it's a test but

30
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.930
probably a mistake when if I leave price
or misspell quantity at some point.

31
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.130
There's speaking of misspelling
quantity there it is.

32
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.730
Misspelled that and looks like we
have it ready to go and our actions.

33
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.608
We've got it ready going our dispatch, we
just really need to reduce our logic and

34
00:02:19.608 --> 00:02:22.190
that should do the trick of for us.

35
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.550
So we'll say, we'll pull in this item
quantity updated that we just made.

36
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.338
And, we will grab this last reducer,

37
00:02:35.338 --> 00:02:38.999
that piece of reducer logic.

38
00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:43.360
As well, and here will change.

39
00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.177
All right, now is the test to see
where I misspelled something.

40
00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:57.090
So go in here as well.

41
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.860
All right, I should be able, it works,
I got it right on the first try.

42
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.743
All right, that's a pleasant surprise.

43
00:03:06.698 --> 00:03:07.198
Cool.
