00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.806
So we're gonna take a quick
challenge break which is,

2
00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:07.230
I made one that monitors performance.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.923
Why don't you create one that simply
console logs the state before we call

4
00:00:11.923 --> 00:00:16.920
the reducer, and then console logs it
again afterwards so that we can actually

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.560
see before and after on every single
action that flows through, right.

6
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.471
This is something you might
want to turn on development.

7
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:27.417
Now you don't have to add console logs all
over your reducers, you make one enhancer,

8
00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:30.772
every action that flows through will
console log before we hit the reducer

9
00:00:30.772 --> 00:00:31.330
and after.

10
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.847
So it'll be very similar to what we see
in this monitor reducer with a little bit

11
00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:36.410
different of an implementation.
