>> So we're gonna take a quick challenge break which is, I made one that monitors performance. Why don't you create one that simply console logs the state before we call the reducer, and then console logs it again afterwards so that we can actually see before and after on every single action that flows through, right.

This is something you might want to turn on development. Now you don't have to add console logs all over your reducers, you make one enhancer, every action that flows through will console log before we hit the reducer and after. So it'll be very similar to what we see in this monitor reducer with a little bit different of an implementation.
