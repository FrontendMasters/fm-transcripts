00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.681
So it's pretty straightforward right?

2
00:00:02.681 --> 00:00:04.595
Just get a little bit of
muscle memory on this,

3
00:00:04.595 --> 00:00:06.271
we have our different action creators.

4
00:00:06.271 --> 00:00:08.960
We are dispatching each of them.

5
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.401
Could we bind all the action creators we
can take a look at some of those things.

6
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:16.719
Let's get it in place we can say unclick.

7
00:00:16.719 --> 00:00:19.977
And here we're just gonna dispatch

8
00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:31.286
Increment And
gotta make sure we import it.

9
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.841
And here we'll dispatch decrement.

10
00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.330
And let's go make sure that all works
because we get too far ahead of ourselves.

11
00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.503
Increment, we can decrement.

12
00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:00.450
And again, you can kinda see everything.

13
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.861
You can jump to any previous
state as well in the tools.

14
00:01:05.313 --> 00:01:08.841
And we can reset it,
[INAUDIBLE] stuck in one place now, but

15
00:01:08.841 --> 00:01:10.572
I can move down here as well.

16
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:14.530
And then command and decrement.

17
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.610
Okay, so we've gotta wire it up.

18
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.546
This is, again,
we've got a kinda core piece of this.

19
00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:25.320
This does not mean that everything
has to go into Redux state.

20
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.290
One of the ways I like to think about
it is we use the word state as a very

21
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.870
broad term, right?

22
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.141
There is the state the things you're
getting back from the API okay.

23
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:38.972
If you're managing a context database or
to dues list or something like that.

24
00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:41.126
There's dos, and stuff along those lines.

25
00:01:41.126 --> 00:01:45.122
As I think about that is
what I call model state.

26
00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:50.961
Then you have things like,
is that accordion open or close, right?

27
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:53.733
What is currently in that form?

28
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.140
Do those need to go into Redux?

29
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.402
What do you think?

30
00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:58.020
Thumbs up or thumbs down?

31
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.951
Should I put those things in?

32
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:00.561
I see a thumbs down.

33
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:02.632
All right,
generally speaking is thumbs down.

34
00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:06.085
I see just indecisive thumb, right?

35
00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:08.044
I saw a sideways,Oh, now it moved down.

36
00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.100
I think it went with the wisdom
of the crowds in that case.

37
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.913
Generally speaking,
I think that is a femoral state, right?

38
00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:19.295
A lot of times you can still use component
state for those kinds of states.

39
00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:22.139
You don't have to listen team,
we use Redux now,

40
00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.050
everything has to go into Redux.

41
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.722
I think all of the kind of business logic
state, you probably wanna put in Redux,

42
00:02:27.722 --> 00:02:29.291
but that kind of view layer state.

43
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.860
Is this open or close?

44
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.811
Is it expanded or not?

45
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:36.361
Whats the draft field in that form, right?

46
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:39.253
Those kind of things can
actually stay in component state.

47
00:02:39.253 --> 00:02:40.724
The rest of your application,

48
00:02:40.724 --> 00:02:44.297
doesn't necessarily need to know
anything about what's going on there.

49
00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:47.689
Now when they submit that form,
we might dispatch an action and

50
00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.170
store the result in state.

51
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.949
Right, that might change some things.

52
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:53.884
But as they're actually just typing or
anything along those lines.

53
00:02:53.884 --> 00:02:57.715
You don't necessarily need to
run through this entire process,

54
00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:00.020
that can stay inside of the component.
