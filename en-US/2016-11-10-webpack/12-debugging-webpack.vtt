00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.231
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:05.532
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Unfortunately,

3
00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:10.330
we're gonna skip this bit because
we are pretty far behind.

4
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.830
But I'll explain that
there's this cool thing

5
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.010
in Node version seven which is unstable
Node, it will be stable on version eight.

6
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.928
But you can run it with --inspect and

7
00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:29.200
then --debug brk.

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.440
Actually, well, I'll all go ahead and
do that, npm, well,

9
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.855
we'll just check out the next branch.

10
00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:37.230
So you can feel free to check out
the next branch as well and try this.

11
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.420
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: But
if we run npm run debug:dev.

12
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.450
Then it's gonna give me a URL to
put in my Chrome browser that will

13
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:57.420
open up the DevTools and put a breakpoint
at the first line of JavaScript code.

14
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.980
And I have my DevTools, so
I can step over to the next line.

15
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.120
And I can save path.resolve or
relative or whatever, and

16
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.530
I can like use all that stuff
right in my Chrome DevTools.

17
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.670
It's super, super handy and

18
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.490
one thing that this branch is adding
that we're gonna skip over, is

19
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.430
it also adds another env property to
our command line flags for debug.

20
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.160
And so you can specify, okay,
npm run build with env debug.

21
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.620
And then you get a console
log of your config, and

22
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.426
you also get a debugger right here.

23
00:01:31.426 --> 00:01:36.159
So you can look at your config objects and
see, okay, so

24
00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.289
my context is actually
this URL in my output, and

25
00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.660
you can actually even say,
config.output = cool story bro.

26
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.980
And then you can play on through and
you totally broke your webpack stuff.

27
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.120
But hopefully,
that can make it a little bit easier for

28
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.430
you to work through webpack stuff.

29
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.070
Unfortunately, right now,
node-nightly does not work for Windows.

30
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.477
Hopefully, by this afternoon or
later today,

31
00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:05.740
it maybe even it will cuz I know
they're working on it right now.
