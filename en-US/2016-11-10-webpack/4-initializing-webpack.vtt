WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.797
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:05.980
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
we're gonna initialize Webpack.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.640
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna walk you
through some of the things that we're

4
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.640
gonna do.

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.890
Each step has, actually, let me just
kinda show you what we've got here.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.305
I'm gonna skip ahead.

7
00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:23.325
And so, each slide, and this is why I say
go check out the slides, because each

8
00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:28.595
slide, well, for exercises has a link to
a, to the GitHub repo for this project.

9
00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:31.880
And it's a diff of all of the things that
we're going to be doing for the step.

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.080
And so, this way, if you get lost,
you can go reference that.

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.840
Please don't use it as a crutch,
because you're here to learn, right?

12
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.100
So, you can use it as a reference.

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.033
And I'm using it as a reference
right here, because reasons.

14
00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:50.968
And so, what we're gonna do is I'm gonna
kind of walk through different pieces,

15
00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.122
show you why things are important.

16
00:00:53.122 --> 00:00:58.349
And then, kinda depending on the way
that you like to learn, you can

17
00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:05.152
either follow along with me, or I will
give you time to go and do it yourself.

18
00:01:05.152 --> 00:01:08.500
After you, at reasonable increments, and

19
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.940
so, if you like to follow along in stuff,
then that's great.

20
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.670
Otherwise, you can just watch, and

21
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.710
then I'll give you time to work
through the exercise on your own.

22
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.210
Sound good?

23
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.130
Okay, great, so yeah,
let's just go ahead and get started.

24
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.710
We'll pretend that we're just gonna

25
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.220
build this with the error messages
that Webpack is gonna give us.

26
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.186
So, the first thing that we're
going to need to do, and I'm sorry,

27
00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:40.121
another backtrack.

28
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:42.260
So, I had you run that script.

29
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.656
What that script did is it checked
out the very last branch and

30
00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:48.721
it installed all the dependencies
on the last branch,

31
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:52.260
cuz that will have all the dependencies
through the whole day.

32
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.064
And then it checked out the first branch,
and so, this way, it is if you don't

33
00:01:56.064 --> 00:02:00.236
have a really super Internet or something,
you only have to run the npm install once.

34
00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:04.530
And now, you don't actually
have to npm install anything.

35
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.553
But it's kind of nice
to have those things.

36
00:02:07.553 --> 00:02:11.963
So I'm gonna enter them in manually right
here, but they actually do already exist

37
00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:16.990
in our known models directory, which is
ginormous, full of modules that we love.

38
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:24.445
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there a way
to change the contrast?

39
00:02:26.687 --> 00:02:30.052
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Sure.

40
00:02:30.052 --> 00:02:34.060
Yeah, I've never used this before but
no, that's fine.

41
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.350
How is that?

42
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's good.

43
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:40.000
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: That's good?

44
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.020
Okay, cool, terminal.

45
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.140
I had, don't know what to do about that,
but hopefully this is helpful.

46
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.890
Wow, that's different for me, okay, cool.

47
00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.169
So [LAUGH] that's all right.

48
00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:54.723
Actually, fun story, I do use vim,
obviously, I come on, I'm in vim mode,

49
00:02:54.723 --> 00:02:59.150
right here, and every time I boot up vim,
it chooses a random color scheme.

50
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.460
And so, every single time I open vim,
it's raining random color scheme.

51
00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.030
I actually really, really like it a lot,
but I couldn't do vim anymore.

52
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.070
It was just, didn't provide enough for me.

53
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.510
So, for Webpack, you're gonna want to,
well, I need to reference this.

54
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.070
This is the only one that's kind of funny.

55
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.899
So, it's 2.1.0-beta.20.

56
00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.720
That's the latest beta version.

57
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.766
So, you can install that by
doing an npm install --save-dev

58
00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:34.010
webpack@beta, and
that will install it just like that.

59
00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.375
Here's the little pro tip for you,
you can do, shorten save dev to -D,

60
00:03:40.375 --> 00:03:43.410
and you can shorten install to i.

61
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.030
So, that's what I normally type.

62
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.949
Actually, what I normally type is ni,
cuz I have an alias.

63
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.592
Or actually, an iCache, so
I load it from the cache, so fun stuff.

64
00:03:54.592 --> 00:03:58.896
Okay, so, but with web pack installed, if
you look in your node modules in your bin

65
00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:01.557
directory, you'll see you
have a bunch of files.

66
00:04:01.557 --> 00:04:03.180
And here, what on earth are these things?

67
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.230
They're all, got this little error thing.

68
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.672
That's a vim link to a COI,
or a binary, for

69
00:04:08.672 --> 00:04:14.820
these different projects that you
have installed in your node modules.

70
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.000
And one of those is Webpack.

71
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.940
And so,
you don't need to install it globally.

72
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.840
I know that was really common practice
back in the grunt and gulp days.

73
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.012
I think they're starting to move
more to local installs as well,

74
00:04:27.012 --> 00:04:30.080
because of a lot of problems with
versions of global packages.

75
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.800
But yeah, so, we're gonna use this
local version of Webpack that we have.

76
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.871
And one cool thing about scripts is that
these scripts will source that directory,

77
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:41.378
and so,

78
00:04:41.378 --> 00:04:46.900
you can utilize those binaries without
actually having to directly point to them.

79
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.740
So, all the talk, basically to say
we're going to add a build dev

80
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.700
script here that's going to use Webpack.

81
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.380
And that will resolve to this
Webpack in our own modules stop in.

82
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.110
So, with that, if we ran an npm run build
dev, then we're gonna get a fun error.

83
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.170
Lots of the errors here it's
gonna be npm error stuff.

84
00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:14.250
I don't care about npm errors.

85
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.640
And so, I'm gonna add -s to say hey,
npm, be quiet.

86
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.610
I just care about the errors
I get from Webpack.

87
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.490
So here, the first thing that we get is
there's no configuration file found, and

88
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:33.620
no output file name configured, and so, we
need to start by creating a Webpack file.

89
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.215
So a new file called web, and
it's telling us it needs to be called

90
00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:42.340
webpack.config.js, but it's kind of fun,

91
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.590
it says a configuration file
could be named webpack config.js.

92
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.270
You can also specify on the CLI
what config you want to use.

93
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.210
But a fun little trick is you can add that
babel on here and it will transpire all

94
00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.940
your Webpack config with babel, right
before it actually loads that config.

95
00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:07.140
So, we're gonna do this, just in case some
of you don't have note 6 installed yet,

96
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.070
hopefully this will resolve
some of those problems.

97
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.930
It works either way.

98
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.600
But when you take out the next branch,
and we keep going,

99
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.400
it's going to be Webpack Config Babel.

100
00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.250
So, yeah, fun stories there.

101
00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.250
Okay, so now that we have this file,
let's go ahead and run it again.

102
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.679
And we're gonna see now that we
still need this output file name,

103
00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:34.960
either as output.filename,
or configured via CLI.

104
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.580
And so, let's go ahead and

105
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.790
actually create a module inside
of this Webpack config file.

106
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.465
So, we're gonna be using common js.

107
00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:48.900
We'll say module.exports, and
what we're going to export is a function,

108
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.420
and because I'm hipster,
I use arrow functions for everything.

109
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.980
I'm just joking.

110
00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.580
I use arrow functions when it doesn't
make much of a difference, either way.

111
00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.210
And here,
we're going to return our configuration.

112
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.000
So then, we'll, all, it's asking us for
an output.file name.

113
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.890
So, we'll provide an output object and
a file name, and we'll call it bundle,

114
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:19.233
this is the most common file name for
Webpack configurations.

115
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.330
So, yeah?

116
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:25.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Quick question about they
already have global Webpack installed

117
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.540
that conflict with a local Webpack?

118
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.363
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Good question.
Yeah, so, if you have global dependencies,

119
00:07:30.363 --> 00:07:32.520
this applies to any known modules at all.

120
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.243
If you have global dependencies at all,

121
00:07:35.243 --> 00:07:39.830
the local dependencies will
be resolved through to first.

122
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.500
So, local wins, which is great.

123
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.740
Thank heaven for that.

124
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.490
Yeah, great question.
