2
00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:07.471
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, and we're
actually gonna skip past this one too,

3
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:11.440
because I think it's also
pretty straightforward.

4
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.750
Again, this is all in
the spirit of iterating slowly,

5
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.220
like working our way into Webpack world.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.820
Because even with the way the we had it,

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.420
it's still not technically
explicit dependencies.

8
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.970
We need to like,
we're acquiring this file but

9
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.480
it's just tacking stuff
onto the window dot app.

10
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.610
So we want to instead require specific
things from those different modules and

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.680
then from each one of these modules
we want to export specific things.

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.420
Here we're using a CommonJS.

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.730
I start with CommonJS because I feel like
most of you are probably more familiar

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.570
with CommonJS than you
are with your six modules.

15
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.060
We'll move on to modules
a little bit later.

16
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.870
But yeah, that's the basic idea
of what we're doing in this step,

17
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.950
is making the exports explicit

18
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.280
as well as the imports of
the require statements explicit.

19
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.800
And the cool thing about that is now if,

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.070
let's say that in this helpers file or
inside of app.js we require helpers.

21
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.130
But we somehow we don't end up
using helpers in this file at all,

22
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.700
then we know that we don't not only do
not need to require it in this file, but

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.640
maybe we don't need that
file in our project at all.

24
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.980
We can get rid of it.

25
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.490
So that's having explicit dependencies
solves a lot of problems.

26
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.920
Just kind of out of the box for us.
