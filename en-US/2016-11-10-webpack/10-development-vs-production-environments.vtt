00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.174
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.174 --> 00:00:08.468
&gt;&gt; Kent: I mention that we want to be able
to distinguish between production and

3
00:00:08.468 --> 00:00:13.654
development in our configuration here
when we're generating our configuration.

4
00:00:13.654 --> 00:00:19.270
And that's why we're using a function
rather than an object is because

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.620
we can actually accept a parameter here,
we're gonna call it env.

6
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.532
And in our package.json,
we can set, in these scripts,

7
00:00:29.532 --> 00:00:36.366
we can set that env object to have a
couple properties, so we'll say env.prod.

8
00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:41.328
And with the way that webpack
is using a package called yargs,

9
00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:45.540
which has a pirate logo
which is kind of fun, yargs.

10
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.338
But yeah, by doing this with yargs,
it will take that env object and

11
00:00:51.338 --> 00:00:57.030
create a property on it called prod,
which is set to true.

12
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.280
And so alternatively,
we can say env.dev for

13
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.730
our dev server and
env.dev for our dev build.

14
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.849
And so then, inside of our webpack config,
we can say env.prod,

15
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:19.013
and we'll just do a ternary operator here.

16
00:01:19.013 --> 00:01:23.911
Oops.
&gt;&gt; Kent: So there's a way to clean this

17
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:28.229
up so it looks a little bit nicer if
you're afraid of ternaries, like I am.

18
00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.247
But yeah, that's basically, that's the
process to distinguish between the two.

19
00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:39.043
So I'll let you go ahead and
implement that and

20
00:01:39.043 --> 00:01:43.921
you can check out your source
maps in dev and prod yourself.

21
00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:51.078
&gt;&gt; Kent: Any questions or anything,

22
00:01:51.078 --> 00:01:55.107
feel free to ask.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There was a couple of just,

23
00:01:55.107 --> 00:01:56.655
they talked about it in chat.

24
00:01:56.655 --> 00:01:59.374
But do you recommend to
start using webpack 2 now on

25
00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:03.361
production?
&gt;&gt; Kent: So

26
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:07.053
webpack 2 is, yeah,
it's technically in beta.

27
00:02:07.053 --> 00:02:09.876
I would say that it's
totally safe to use now.

28
00:02:09.876 --> 00:02:14.483
There are a couple of bugs and
lots of the hesitancy to

29
00:02:14.483 --> 00:02:19.732
officially release it is cuz
the docs aren't at all ready.

30
00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:24.682
But at the same time, webpack 2 and
webpack 1 are really similar.

31
00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:27.212
So far, what we're looking at here,

32
00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:32.368
the only difference is that this is
a function that returns a webpack config.

33
00:02:32.368 --> 00:02:35.911
And I'm pretty sure they're gonna
backport that to webpack 1 anyway.

34
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.223
But yeah, everything else that we're
looking at right here works with both

35
00:02:39.223 --> 00:02:40.059
webpack 1 and 2.

36
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.820
So there's not a whole
lot far as API changes.

37
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.620
And as far as functionality,
I haven't had any trouble, so.
