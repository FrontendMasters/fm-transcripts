&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Like I said,
we're gonna skip over the ES6 stuff.

3
00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:11.910
I'll just show you briefly that one
just changes require statements,

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.450
import statements.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.148
Now we can have import specifiers
to pull out exactly what we want.

6
00:00:18.148 --> 00:00:21.633
This looks like that destructuring
feature that I was telling you about.

7
00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:22.750
It is not.

8
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.480
It is not destructuring.

9
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.950
You think that it is and
then you cry when you find out it's not.

10
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.110
I made a big, big mistake for
a long time thinking that was that.

11
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.660
Well, I knew it wasn't destructuring but

12
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.950
I thought it worked like destructuring,
and it doesn't.

13
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.245
And so, if you wanna learn more about
that, check out the video I mentioned.

14
00:00:42.245 --> 00:00:45.150
But yeah,
that's pretty much all this one's doing.

15
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.260
If you want to do this in your spare
time later, then that is cool.

16
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.743
But we're gonna skip over that cuz it's
not pertinent to web packing necessarily.

17
00:00:53.743 --> 00:00:58.904
One part about that that is important,
is that for this Tree Shaking thing

18
00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:03.911
to work that I'm about to show you,
your modules do you have to be ES6.

19
00:01:03.911 --> 00:01:09.274
This doesn't work with require JS,
it doesn't work with the CommonJS,

20
00:01:09.274 --> 00:01:14.215
and it doesn't work with AMD, or
asynchronous model definition.

21
00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:16.129
If you're not familiar with that,
don't worry about it.

22
00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:20.910
It's dying and
nobody really uses that anymore.

23
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.410
So yeah, you do have to use ES6.
