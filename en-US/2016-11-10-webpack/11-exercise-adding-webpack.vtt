00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:05.850
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Everybody
can go to the slides or

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.878
you can just copy this right here.

4
00:00:07.878 --> 00:00:14.237
It is gitcheckout-fFEM/ and
then that 01.0-add-webpack.

5
00:00:14.237 --> 00:00:22.960
And with that -f you're gonna blow
away all the work that you've done.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.050
I'm sorry,hopefully
you're not too offended.

7
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.330
But let me talk about a couple
of the things that changed here.

8
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.110
Yeah, I'll leave that open,
so you can see that.

9
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.360
So we still are requiring the same things.

10
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.640
We did take in one more dependency
called webpack configure tells.

11
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.420
This is something that I wrote because I
think that functions look cleaner than.

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.380
And so what this gives us is several
things that simplify our webpack config,

13
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.110
but one of those things is this getIfUtils
where we can pass it our ENV object and

14
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.650
then it gives us back some functions that
we can invoke based off of that object.

15
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.030
And so we can just say ifProd source-map
otherwise eval and so like we'll be using

16
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.405
a couple functions from that also use if
not Prod and different things like that.

17
00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:25.025
But I feel like it reads a little easier
than not totally, totally useful but

18
00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:32.030
one other thing that this added was I
added a pre-build and a pre-build dev.

19
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.490
So this is quick like NPM scripts protip.

20
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.600
When NPM scripts,

21
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.860
when you say NPM run build one of
the first things it does is it checks for

22
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.820
other scripts that have lifecycle hooks
and one of those lifecycle hooks is pre.

23
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510
And so if it finds something that
is pre and then that whatever

24
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.940
the name of the script you're running,
then it's gonna run the script first.

25
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.320
And so I'm using a package called rimraf
which is basically on a mac the VRM-RF.

26
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.470
On Windows, that's different and so

27
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.880
we have a package to just
delete that directory for us.

28
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.020
That way we don't have stale
builds between build runs so

29
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.410
hopefully that all makes sense.

30
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.080
It's not like totally crucial to
your understanding of webpack so

31
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.980
we skipped over that.

32
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.580
Also updated the validate
script to add build there so

33
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.270
that we make sure that we can validate
that the build can actually run.

34
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.770
So.
