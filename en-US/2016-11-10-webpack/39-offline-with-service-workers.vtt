00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.977
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.977 --> 00:00:06.120
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Okay, now we're gonna
get to something really exciting.

3
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.911
When I discovered this I was
holy shnikies, this is so easy.

4
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:15.474
Okay, so that's the extract.css,

5
00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:20.190
we can check that out,
which apparently is maybe broken somehow.

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.400
I'm sorry, I'll look at it.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.480
So offline Progressive Web Apps fun stuff,
this is great.

8
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.679
So in modern web browsers now you have
this cool thing called Service Worker and

9
00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:35.930
that allows you to have
things that are offline.

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.102
I actually,
well I'm not going to show you that, but

11
00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:45.500
actually JavaScriptAir.com this
is my podcast and it's awesome.

12
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.060
This week we're gonna be talking
about how to be a mentor.

13
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.655
Check this out, the past present and
future of JavaScript with Brendan Eich.

14
00:00:51.655 --> 00:00:54.340
[SOUND] Yeah, that was an awesome show.

15
00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.980
So JavaScript Air is actually built
with React and it is a static web site.

16
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.910
So it's actually generated at
build time which is pretty cool.

17
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.250
So one other cool thing about it,
is it actually works totally offline.

18
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.484
So if I turn off my Wi-Fi,
hopefully I can turn it back on safely.

19
00:01:17.484 --> 00:01:21.000
But I'll open an entirely new tab and
it totally works.

20
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.350
If I go to Google.com, no no, no, no.

21
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.380
But JavaScript Air I can refresh.

22
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.780
Totally works offline and it's using
a technology called Service Worker.

23
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.880
Well, I'd show you it on my phone, but
I think you get the idea, it's awesome.

24
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.280
Service Worker requires HTTPS.

25
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.909
So if you're not using HTTPS, shame
on you, and you should be doing that.

26
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.785
No, sorry not shame on you,
but please do that.

27
00:01:46.785 --> 00:01:52.541
But yeah, what we're gonna do is
add Service Worker to our app.

28
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:56.620
And there are just a couple of
things we need to do to do that.

29
00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.540
There is a plugin that does this for us.

30
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.310
So this last little bit is
just the rise of the plugins

31
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.300
that just do magical things for us.

32
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.767
And so somewhere in here we're
going to say offline-plugin.

33
00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:16.103
If that's not a generic name
that doesn't describe that

34
00:02:16.103 --> 00:02:19.091
it's a webpack plugin I
don't know what it is, but

35
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:23.500
it's 3.4.2 so I actually realized
just today that I had this.

36
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.260
I'm not sure what's doing this for me,
but it's auto completing the versions.

37
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.930
What, that's that's so cool!

38
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.700
So yeah, but that's the latest version and

39
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.130
that's the one that you should
have when you installed stuff.

40
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.500
So there are a couple things we need to
do to make this work, just a handful.

41
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.815
The first is,
we'll go to our webpack config and yet

42
00:02:46.815 --> 00:02:54.519
again we're gonna pull in the
OfflinePlugin from require offline-plugin.

43
00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.419
And then we'll go down to our
plugins array and at some point,

44
00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:03.160
I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter where,
we can say new OfflinePlugin.

45
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.120
And then all that we need to do and

46
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.670
actually, I think I heard that it
was possible to do a little bit of

47
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.930
configuration in here to have
it auto install in your app.

48
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.510
But we're gonna do it manually just so

49
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.070
you see it a little bit more
of what's going on here.

50
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.470
So here we'll go into our bootstrap.

51
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.623
And in the bootstrap is where we want to
actually turn on the offline capability.

52
00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.215
So we're going to import install, oops.

53
00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:38.618
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: as offline, oops.

54
00:03:40.774 --> 00:03:45.952
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Because install
isn't a very descriptive name,

55
00:03:45.952 --> 00:03:49.690
from offline-plugin/runtime.

56
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.885
And then we're gonna take
that offline install and

57
00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:53.783
in our bootstrap we're just gonna call it.

58
00:04:01.525 --> 00:04:04.093
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And
if we run the dev server.

59
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.500
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: [SOUND] We refresh and
we start getting,

60
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.630
actually I didn't refresh,
it refreshed for me.

61
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.215
We start getting this SW Install event and
Cached assets and yada yada yada.

62
00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:22.288
And now if you see here,

63
00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:28.660
you see a couple of things that have
the little gear icon next to them.

64
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.840
That means that they're being
served from the service record.

65
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.805
So if I refresh, well, things
are a little bit funny in development.

66
00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:41.470
But we'll take a look at
production here in a little bit.

67
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.970
But if you go to Application and
look at Service Worker,

68
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.730
you'll see that it's installed.

69
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.570
And you can, let's see,

70
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.370
there's a place to inspect
the Service Worker somewhere.

71
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.152
Hold up.

72
00:04:56.152 --> 00:04:58.862
Yeah, so you can look at what
the Service Worker looks like.

73
00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:04.196
The Service Worker is just responsible for
caching all of your assets and

74
00:05:04.196 --> 00:05:08.757
so the Service Worker plugin
generates this Service Worker.

75
00:05:08.757 --> 00:05:10.200
Whoa, that's a spider.

76
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.614
&gt;&gt; Multiple: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Aah!

77
00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:16.162
Sorry I should have screamed.

78
00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:19.491
And based off of all
the things that we need for

79
00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:24.450
our application like all of our assets for
our application.

80
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.200
And it will, when the browser
goes to make a request for it,

81
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.940
it will say is this thing in
the Service Worker cache?

82
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.930
If it is then just serve
it from the cache.

83
00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.210
If it's not then go to the server and
get it and then cache it.

84
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.595
And so then you don't need to
worry about loading it when it,

85
00:05:41.595 --> 00:05:45.290
yeah, when you've already cached it.

86
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.800
So the cool thing about this
is we already talked about

87
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.850
long term caching with having
that chunk cache and everything.

88
00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.113
That's all cool and stuff, but
the browser is just gonna throw up

89
00:05:57.113 --> 00:06:00.749
its hands if it's offline unless
there's a Service Worker installed.

90
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.095
So I'm gonna do one other thing.

91
00:06:04.095 --> 00:06:05.781
Where did it go?

92
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:06.338
Here.

93
00:06:06.338 --> 00:06:10.358
We actually don't want to install the
offline mode in development because that

94
00:06:10.358 --> 00:06:12.222
makes development a little tricky.

95
00:06:12.222 --> 00:06:15.349
And so I'm not going to show you or

96
00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:20.822
belabor you with the code to do this but
this is what you do,

97
00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:25.890
process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'.

98
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.081
So this is something that you
would normally do in Node because

99
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:32.592
Node has processing via NODE_ENV.

100
00:06:32.592 --> 00:06:35.593
But you normally wouldn't
do this in the browser.

101
00:06:35.593 --> 00:06:40.654
But we have this cool defined plugin
thing that comes from webpack.

102
00:06:40.654 --> 00:06:42.410
Where you can say hey, webpack,

103
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.030
any time you come across
something that is processed.env,

104
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.290
I want you to replace that with this
object that has a NODE_ENV property.

105
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.610
And that NODE_ENV property
will be this value.

106
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.020
And so
you provide that value as a string and

107
00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.370
it will just take whatever you put in
that string and plop it in its place.

108
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.960
So what that will do is
it will basically say.

109
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.580
So originally your code
will look like this,

110
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.310
your source code will look like this,
it will say okay this is NODE_ENV.

111
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.310
So I'm in production mode and so I'm going
to say okay "production" === 'production'

112
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.920
then it will actually
evaluate that even further.

113
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.240
Well I think Uglify will
evaluate this to true.

114
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.838
And then it will actually get rid
of the statement altogether because

115
00:07:26.838 --> 00:07:28.040
that's always true, right?

116
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.350
And so it will just say okay,
offlineInstall.

117
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.347
But alternatively this will be development
and that will evaluate to false, and

118
00:07:35.347 --> 00:07:37.561
then Uglify will remove that code.

119
00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:42.430
It's dead code because you
can never reach that code.

120
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:49.399
Yeah, so I'm actually just to not have
to type all that I'm gonna go here.

121
00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:50.349
And we'll check that out.

122
00:07:50.349 --> 00:07:52.667
And then I'm going to run build.

123
00:07:55.099 --> 00:08:02.014
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: And

124
00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:07.600
Service Worker like I said requires HTTPS
unless you're serving from local hosts.

125
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.591
Thank the browser overlords for
doing that because

126
00:08:11.591 --> 00:08:16.524
developing with local hosts as
HTTPS is a real pain in the rear.

127
00:08:16.524 --> 00:08:24.238
So now if we run npm start it will
start up our HTTP server on dist.

128
00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:25.690
Where did my browser go?

129
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:31.630
We'll run that, or I refreshed
the browser, you couldn't tell.

130
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.213
But now we have that
Service Worker installed and

131
00:08:36.213 --> 00:08:40.252
if we go to Application &gt; Service Worker.

132
00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:45.404
And I'm actually not,
well I guess you have this Offline button,

133
00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:51.410
but I don't really trust it,
because I'm not actually offline, so yeah.

134
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.910
But it says that it's working somehow,
so, I don't know.

135
00:08:55.176 --> 00:08:57.740
But what's gonna be cool
is in this next step

136
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:01.810
when y'all push your own version of
this app to a production thing and

137
00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.340
then you turn off your Wi-Fi and
it's still running.

138
00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.944
That's what's gonna be cool and
that's what we're doing next.

139
00:09:06.944 --> 00:09:10.016
But before I go into that I
would like to open it up for

140
00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:12.743
questions because I've been talking a lot.

141
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:18.196
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: You're sitting here like,
well this is heaven or

142
00:09:18.196 --> 00:09:20.700
this is scary or a little of both.

143
00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:25.350
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Part of it is, web
workers it's, where do these even work?

144
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:29.120
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: You know, Chrome and-

145
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.123
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Well Service Worker.

146
00:09:30.123 --> 00:09:31.067
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: Service Worker.

147
00:09:31.067 --> 00:09:33.203
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, Service Worker,
that's a good question.

148
00:09:33.203 --> 00:09:38.885
Service worker or browser support.

149
00:09:41.635 --> 00:09:43.520
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: I'm fairly
certain it's not just Chrome.

150
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.800
I think Edge supports Service Worker.

151
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.167
I'm pretty sure Firefox
supports Service Worker.

152
00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:56.914
Yeah, so you got Firefox and
Chrome, Opera, Android browser,

153
00:09:56.914 --> 00:09:59.260
Chrome for Android.

154
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:04.514
Looks like you're still hurting for
Safari forever.

155
00:10:04.514 --> 00:10:09.983
Safari is the new IE and looks like
Edge doesn't have it quite yet either.

156
00:10:09.983 --> 00:10:16.980
But yeah, this is a cool thing that users
using modern browsers can leverage.

157
00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.470
&gt;&gt; Off Camer 2: And
it won't blow up on those other ones.

158
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:22.657
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Right, yeah, the offline
install actually what it's doing is it

159
00:10:22.657 --> 00:10:26.992
says if service, now I can't
remember what it's called, the API,

160
00:10:26.992 --> 00:10:29.791
but it'll check for the API in navigation.

161
00:10:29.791 --> 00:10:31.071
Yeah?

162
00:10:31.071 --> 00:10:32.078
&gt;&gt; Off Camera 1: He's asking if,

163
00:10:32.078 --> 00:10:36.641
aren't there issues with when the chunk
cache changes, as far as I know updating

164
00:10:36.641 --> 00:10:41.110
Service Worker and making the browser
use the new worker is not trivial.

165
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.310
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, so that's the
beauty of using these plugins that are so

166
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:50.140
powerful is the plugin actually
doesn't use the chunk cache thing so

167
00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.690
the browser will have to go get
the Service Worker every time.

168
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.320
But that doesn't prevent it from
actually loading the app, so

169
00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.946
if it is online,
it's gonna load the app fast and

170
00:10:58.946 --> 00:11:03.360
then it will load the Service Worker and
the Service Worker will cache everything.

171
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.271
Yeah, the cool part of this Service Worker
cache thing that I wanted to.

172
00:11:08.271 --> 00:11:12.030
Well no, I'll talk about that in
a little bit when we deploy our apps.

173
00:11:12.030 --> 00:11:17.005
But yeah, you don't ever really need to
worry about the Service Worker not being

174
00:11:17.005 --> 00:11:20.080
updated because the browser
will always check for

175
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.366
the Service Worker if it's online.

176
00:11:24.445 --> 00:11:25.430
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah?
&gt;&gt; Off Camer 2: There is one more at

177
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.180
the end there-
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah.

178
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.680
&gt;&gt; Off Camer 2: Is it
automagically going to update

179
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.420
files that changed on each deployment?

180
00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.200
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yes it will do that.

181
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:38.400
And, yeah, so
that answers Billy's question, as well.

182
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.680
It will automagically
update the hashes as well.

183
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:45.040
It will update all
the resources on every build.

184
00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.500
That's part of what it
has in that sw.js file.

185
00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.583
It has that mapping of all the assets.

186
00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:55.085
And so then when the user loads that
Service Worker file it'll say okay,

187
00:11:55.085 --> 00:11:56.956
here are a bunch of new things and

188
00:11:56.956 --> 00:12:01.050
those new things will actually
be in the index HTML as well.

189
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.950
And the Service Worker,
well the script will tell

190
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.370
the Service Worker hey all of these
things aren't part of my assets anymore.

191
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.876
You can clear that cache and

192
00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:15.686
here I have a new or that part of
the cache and I have a new asset for you.

193
00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:22.846
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Any other questions?

194
00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:27.950
Sweet, there's probably not very
many apps I wouldn't do this on.
