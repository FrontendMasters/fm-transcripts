[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:07.124
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Now we're going to
do something that's useful here and

3
00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:08.910
we'll work on this together.

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.839
So, let me just actually pull out

5
00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.078
my notes here really quick.

6
00:00:18.078 --> 00:00:20.381
Sorry.

7
00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.550
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Okay so here's
the problem that we're trying to solve.

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.442
We, well let me get to our branch
02.1,-add-assertions there and

9
00:00:38.442 --> 00:00:41.590
that'll be checkout -f.

10
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.400
So this is the branch that
you're gonna wanna be on.

11
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.470
So now we have that karma config that
we just saw in the root of our project,

12
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.260
and we want to start actually
testing our modules.

13
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.810
So if we go into our controller test,

14
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.490
we have these worthless tests that
are just testing that they work.

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.770
And actually, if you run npm t,
then that will run current start up,

16
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.160
pop up the browser and
those tests pass which is great.

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.430
JavaScript works.

18
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.050
But we don't care about
JavaScripts working.

19
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.990
We care about our job script working.

20
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:25.116
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna say
const Controller = require controller.

21
00:01:25.116 --> 00:01:27.781
So we're gonna pull that
controller module and

22
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:30.320
we're gonna do some
assertions off of that.

23
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.500
Just from the get go, and

24
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.560
by the way I'm gonna give you some time
to work on this yourself in a little bit.

25
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.630
So if you wanna follow along that's fine,

26
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.320
but if you wanna just soak it in then
that's cool too, however you learn best.

27
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.830
So we're not actually, and

28
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.230
in this project writing the test
is a totally different course.

29
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.590
So we're not gonna write very many tests,
we're gonna write one test just to make

30
00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.130
sure that it works, and we're gonna
say expect(Controller).to.exist.

31
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.160
And fun exercise during lunch somebody can
explain how this actually is an assertion,

32
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.450
JavaScript is so weird.

33
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.280
[LAUGH] I love it though.

34
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.670
So if I go ahead and run npm t, which
is short for npm test or npm run test.

35
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.310
Thank you npm for
making it possible for us to be lazy.

36
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.750
We're gonna get a reference error,
requires not defined.

37
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.067
So can anybody explain why maybe
we'd get an error like that?

38
00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.230
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: So I'll explain
really quick what's happening here.

39
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.170
We've configured karma to load
all files matching this glob.

40
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.760
The only file matching this glob
is controller.test, so this file.

41
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.820
And it's not doing, there's no
webpack integration here at all.

42
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.770
And so we have this require function that
we're calling to get the controller.

43
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.886
So why is the require, or
why are we getting that reference error,

44
00:03:02.886 --> 00:03:04.070
what do you think?

45
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.362
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There's
nothing else in the file.

46
00:03:08.362 --> 00:03:10.910
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, yeah.
So it would basically be like popping up

47
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.290
a browser, copying that code and running
that, that's exactly what it's doing.

48
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.490
And so what we need to do is
integrate webpack with that, so

49
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.870
it will first resolve these dependencies
and then load it into the browser.

50
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.680
And in karma land that's
called a preprocessor,

51
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.290
and so we need a webpack
preprocessor to preprocess our files

52
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.864
before karma sticks them into the browser.

53
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.120
So I'll go ahead and close this guy and
we'll go to our package JSON.

54
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.670
You don't actually have to install
anything, but what what you would install

55
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.750
if you didn't already have it
installed is karma-webpack.

56
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.670
And that would be whatever the latest
version of that is which is 1.7.0.

57
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.220
And with that installed you can use

58
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.010
that plugin in your karma config
which we're going to do now.

59
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.340
So the first thing that karma needs
is it needs you to tell it okay,

60
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.610
so what are the things that we need or
what are the files that I want

61
00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:25.610
to preprocess and it just so happens that
we wanna preprocess all of our test files.

62
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.660
So what I'm gonna do is actually I'm gonna
write a little bit of pseudo code and

63
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.110
then let you take it from there.

64
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:37.940
So what I need is a preprocessors
object right here.

65
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.733
Where the key is glob, so

66
00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:47.820
this is a glob, hint it's this one.

67
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.521
So the key will be a glob that
matches the files that we want to run

68
00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:56.781
through the preprocessor, and
the value will be an array

69
00:04:56.781 --> 00:05:00.971
of the preprocessors that we
wanna have it run through.

70
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.125
The preprocessor's name is webpack, so

71
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:09.722
it'll be a string of all the preprocessors
that we want it to run through.

72
00:05:09.722 --> 00:05:16.050
And then the next thing that we're gonna
need is a property called webpack.

73
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.740
And that the value will be
the webpackconfig that we want.

74
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.150
So essentially this thing, this object.

75
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:30.170
We somehow need to get this
object into our karma config and

76
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.740
assign it to the webpack object, okay.

77
00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.930
I'll give you a hint if you need one.

78
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.090
Yeah, and then I think,
yeah that's pretty much it.

79
00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.870
So go ahead and get started on that,

80
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.580
with that you should actually be able
to run the tests, and it should pass.

81
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.830
Yeah, so go ahead and ask any questions
that you have you need a little bit more

82
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.440
of a hint than what I've given you,
it's okay if you need more of a hint.

83
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.305
I was a little ambiguous with this bit.

84
00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:08.077
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: I'll
start giving the hint, and

85
00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:11.110
if you don't want the hint
then you can tune me out.

86
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.190
But remember that this is
just a JavaScript file.

87
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.530
And it's using common JS for module
exports, and so you can actually require

88
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.852
webpack, webpack.config.babel right here.

89
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.085
And what that's gonna give you is
a function, this arrow function,

90
00:06:31.085 --> 00:06:36.838
that accepts a single argument called env,
that's an object.

91
00:06:36.838 --> 00:06:41.641
And so you can say okay require, I'm just
writing pseudo code here it almost looks

92
00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:44.864
like CoffeeScript until I
start adding parentheses.

93
00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:49.132
But you're gonna provide
it just an object,

94
00:06:49.132 --> 00:06:54.073
if you want to you can say env is test and
that's going

95
00:06:54.073 --> 00:06:58.924
to give you back this
object that it's returning.

96
00:06:58.924 --> 00:07:02.628
And so this, it's gonna give you
back the config, and the value

97
00:07:02.628 --> 00:07:07.304
that you get back from that is what you're
gonna assign to the webpack property.
