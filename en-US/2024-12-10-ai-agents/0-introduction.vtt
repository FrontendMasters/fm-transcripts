00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.530
Welcome everybody to building
AI agents from scratch.

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.970
I'm your instructor here from the master.

3
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.270
Scott Moss, super excited to be
here to teach in this course.

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.518
AI is pretty much all I've been consumed
with for the last year plus, but

5
00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:18.310
specifically the last year running an AI
startup and doing all the AI things there.

6
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.233
So it's pretty much, I feel like I
just had to teach a course on it,

7
00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:23.209
because this is all I'm doing.

8
00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:26.462
But also, because,
as you all know, there's just so

9
00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:31.299
much relevant things happening with AI,
it's part of everyone's tech stack.

10
00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:34.077
And I think this is a very interesting but

11
00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:39.063
required skill that I think folks need
to learn going forward whether you

12
00:00:39.063 --> 00:00:43.881
use AI as a tool to help you write code,
or whether you're writing, or

13
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:48.486
whether you're working on the tool
using AI that writes the code.

14
00:00:48.486 --> 00:00:51.086
Either way,
you need to understand how it works.

15
00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:56.239
So, this course is just diving beyond
the hello world, LLM, things that you

16
00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.657
see online and building something more
functional, something more powerful.

17
00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:03.207
So here is the repo.

18
00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:09.108
It is going to be at my GitHub
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Username,

19
00:01:09.108 --> 00:01:14.496
which is Hendrixer, after my son,
and it's just agent-from-scratch.

20
00:01:14.496 --> 00:01:18.117
So go there, you need that code.

21
00:01:18.117 --> 00:01:19.798
When you pull it down,
you'll be on the main branch.

22
00:01:19.798 --> 00:01:24.508
That branch is the complete version,
so don't start on that branch.

23
00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:27.998
There's another branch called Step /one.

24
00:01:27.998 --> 00:01:30.538
Check out to that branch,
that's where you wanna start.

25
00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:32.562
If you wanna see what it
looks like when it's done,

26
00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:35.688
you can go to the main branch that's there
for you to reference as you go along.

27
00:01:35.688 --> 00:01:37.898
If you wanna see how did I complete it?

28
00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.428
How did I get it done?

29
00:01:39.428 --> 00:01:39.984
It'll be there.

30
00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:42.698
But again, if you also took my course,
we're just gonna build this up from

31
00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:45.474
scratch, and I might do it slightly
different than what the main branch is.

32
00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:47.334
I'll try to keep it the same.

33
00:01:47.334 --> 00:01:49.444
But yeah, that's there for you.

34
00:01:49.444 --> 00:01:51.024
And then onto the notes.

35
00:01:51.024 --> 00:01:55.764
The notes are here and the read me,
we'll go check those out.

36
00:01:55.764 --> 00:02:00.161
Just a page that I hosted on Notion, just
super simple to just to add notes in here.

37
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:02.571
Most of these notes here are just
going to be for two purposes.

38
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:05.280
One, for me just to stay on track, really,

39
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.331
because otherwise I'll just get lost and
detoured because I have severe ADHD.

40
00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:14.181
And then two, a lot of the code that we'll
be doing in that lesson is just in here.

41
00:02:14.181 --> 00:02:18.883
So you can just like, maybe he was
typing too fast or I'm behind,

42
00:02:18.883 --> 00:02:20.500
I want to get caught up.

43
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.309
You can just go into one of these
sections, copy the code, and

44
00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.950
paste it in if you want.

45
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.779
But I also will be doing branches every
single lesson that I push up to GithlHub

46
00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.320
that has the code that we just worked on.

47
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.280
So you can just check out to
that at the end of the lesson.

48
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.665
Let's just dive into the intro and

49
00:02:35.665 --> 00:02:38.867
kinda go over the prerequisites that
you'll need, what you'll be learning,

50
00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.157
how you'll be learning, what you'll
be building all the good things.

51
00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:45.012
Like always, interrupt me if
you have any questions, but

52
00:02:45.012 --> 00:02:48.477
I'll try to be as thorough as I can and
try to get to live coding.

53
00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:49.559
So prerequisites,

54
00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:54.167
what do you need to take advantage of this
course of creating AI agents from scratch?

55
00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:55.827
Well, you really only need two things.

56
00:02:55.827 --> 00:02:58.447
You need to know JavaScript
because we're using JavaScript.

57
00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:00.246
Well, technically I'm using TypeScript,
but you.

58
00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:01.626
You don't need to know typescripts.

59
00:03:01.626 --> 00:03:04.066
If JavaScript, you know TypeScript,
it's totally fine.

60
00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:07.786
If you've never seen TypeScript before,
just write JavaScript.

61
00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.176
It'll work exactly the same.

62
00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:12.743
It's literally the same thing
with optional types and

63
00:03:12.743 --> 00:03:16.786
then having some understanding of like,
how APIs work.

64
00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:21.421
So if you've not to the point where you
build your own APIs, but if you've ever

65
00:03:21.421 --> 00:03:25.439
interacted with an API before,
whether it was like through an SDK.

66
00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.196
Or using some type of fetching mechanism,
like fetch or Ajax, whatever it is,

67
00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:34.740
as long as you know how to interact with
an API and like how to make a request and

68
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.773
get a response, that's it.

69
00:03:36.773 --> 00:03:40.585
Those are the only two things you need
to know to get the best of this course.

70
00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:44.659
And even if you don't know JavaScript, but
you're really good with another language,

71
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.299
a modern language like Python or Ruby and
you're taking this course and you're

72
00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.740
worried that you won't build anything
from it, you'll probably still be fine.

73
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.440
So I wouldn't worry about it.

74
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.706
We're not gonna be doing
any JavaScript trickery, or

75
00:03:57.706 --> 00:03:59.870
there's no frameworks in here.

76
00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.529
There's literally almost
zero dependencies,

77
00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.134
other than some simple
tools to help us with AI.

78
00:04:05.134 --> 00:04:10.307
So it's very simple on
the programming side, which is crazy,

79
00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:15.104
because AI is super advanced,
and it's so weird, cool.

80
00:04:15.104 --> 00:04:20.639
So formats, basically two things I'm gonna
give a lecture, kind of like I said.

81
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:26.341
Introduce a topic and a section, kind of
go over it from the definition of it,

82
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:30.639
then I'll probably talk
about my definition of it.

83
00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.972
And then I'll do some examples, and
then we'll hop right into live coding, and

84
00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:35.050
then we'll take a break,

85
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.159
and we'll do that on repeat until we
finish the app that we're making.

86
00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.403
But in the course, you will have a AI
agent that you can play around with,

87
00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:44.922
build upon, and show off to your friends.

88
00:04:44.922 --> 00:04:47.952
And then, as far as like technical setup,
obviously you need Git.

89
00:04:47.952 --> 00:04:49.947
If you don't have Git, get Git,

90
00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:53.482
that should be the first thing
you do ever as an engineer.

91
00:04:53.482 --> 00:04:57.682
The second thing is just make sure
you have the latest version of node.

92
00:04:57.682 --> 00:04:58.902
I think 20 plus works fine.

93
00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:01.380
I don't even know what version
note is on right now, but

94
00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.074
20 plus works just fine
I tested it with that.

95
00:05:04.074 --> 00:05:08.422
I also use bun, so if you do use bun,
this repo has like a bun lock and

96
00:05:08.422 --> 00:05:09.524
all that stuff.

97
00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:11.218
So if you'd like to use bun,
you can use bun if you want.

98
00:05:11.218 --> 00:05:13.895
But I'm gonna use node and npm for

99
00:05:13.895 --> 00:05:18.780
the sake of just like making
sure this works with everybody.

100
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.935
And then the last thing is
you need to open API account.

101
00:05:21.935 --> 00:05:26.825
I put a link in here to sign up for
it, AI is not free.

102
00:05:26.825 --> 00:05:30.285
Those GPUs go bur so
you got to pay for them.

103
00:05:30.285 --> 00:05:34.366
And I there's a way for me to teach
this course and have everything run on

104
00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:38.185
everyone's computer, but
everybody has different computers.

105
00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:42.765
So some people might wait an hour to get
a response some people might wait five

106
00:05:42.765 --> 00:05:43.421
seconds.

107
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:47.654
It really just depends on what
version of Apple M1 you have or

108
00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:49.651
gaming laptop or whatever.

109
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:51.631
So I decided not to do that.

110
00:05:51.631 --> 00:05:53.419
And we went with OpenAI,

111
00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.111
which I think probably is the most
simplest one that we could use.

112
00:05:58.111 --> 00:06:01.168
There's other ones that we'll talk about,
but we're gonna use OpenAI.

113
00:06:01.168 --> 00:06:02.318
So make an account.

114
00:06:02.318 --> 00:06:07.571
I do think you have to add a card,
and if you're worried about cost,

115
00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:12.638
if you sat here and ran the agent
that we're gonna build over, and

116
00:06:12.638 --> 00:06:18.408
over, and over for the next two hours,
you might pay a dollar, maybe.

117
00:06:18.408 --> 00:06:20.578
That's if you just ran it on
a while loop or something, so

118
00:06:20.578 --> 00:06:22.310
there really isn't
an issue with cost here.

119
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.560
You'll probably spend a couple
pennies today on this.

120
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.784
So, but you need it because,
again, GPUs aren't cheap.
