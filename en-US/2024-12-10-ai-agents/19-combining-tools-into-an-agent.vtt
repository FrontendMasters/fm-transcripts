WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.550
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so we have,
our tools, our tool definitions,

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:08.380
everything looks good,
we'll see what happens.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.234
Let me make sure I delete my history
cuz I think it's about to get weird.

4
00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:16.500
[LAUGH] Whenever you got red
it's going to get weird.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.080
Yeah, I didn't put messages.

6
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.911
Okay, there we go.

7
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.112
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go, okay,

8
00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:26.017
so yeah, make me a meme image
from a random dad joke.

9
00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:32.427
Cool, it's getting the dad joke,
even though I said make the meme first,

10
00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:35.307
it went and got the dad joke first,
that's smart.

11
00:00:35.307 --> 00:00:39.146
It's like I need the dad joke before I
generate the image, so it went and got it.

12
00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:41.893
But I think it was really,
really good sign.

13
00:00:41.893 --> 00:00:46.835
And it generated the image, and
now it's answering, it's gonna answer, and

14
00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.772
then there it is, here you go.

15
00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:51.178
Here's a meme image featuring a dad joke.

16
00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:53.484
Why was it called the dark ages?

17
00:00:53.484 --> 00:00:54.774
Because all of the knights.

18
00:00:54.774 --> 00:00:57.615
Okay I feel this was gonna be bad.

19
00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:00.517
[LAUGH] I feel this is going to be so bad.

20
00:01:00.517 --> 00:01:01.957
Let me see.

21
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.497
My god, why was it called the Dark Ages?

22
00:01:05.497 --> 00:01:06.527
Okay, this one's not that bad.

23
00:01:06.527 --> 00:01:07.177
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's not bad.

24
00:01:07.177 --> 00:01:08.737
It almost even spelled it right.

25
00:01:08.737 --> 00:01:11.277
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
that's really good, actually.

26
00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:14.067
Okay, I can't believe it
actually got the text.

27
00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:15.477
I mean, what the hell is that?

28
00:01:15.477 --> 00:01:16.839
That W, the two Hs.

29
00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:22.270
It's struggling on the Hs but-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or it's artistic.

30
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.723
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Or maybe it's the font.

31
00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:27.550
Okay, I'm actually shocked.

32
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.334
&gt;&gt; Jamie: That's pretty good.

33
00:01:28.334 --> 00:01:29.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's Gothic.

34
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.850
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jamie: Modern Gothic.

35
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.036
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, I kind of feel it
made it look like me in the middle too,

36
00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:34.791
a little bit.

37
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:36.050
How did it know that?

38
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.861
It's kind of creepy, yeah?

39
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:43.696
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean, I like that it
did all the Hs consistently, at least.

40
00:01:43.696 --> 00:01:45.985
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Right,
it did, yeah, okay, okay.

41
00:01:45.985 --> 00:01:51.429
Excuse me, DALLÂ·E, I still don't
think you're that good, but I get it.

42
00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.373
Let's try something with Reddit.

43
00:01:54.373 --> 00:01:56.335
[LAUGH] Let's to do something
with all three of them.

44
00:01:56.335 --> 00:02:03.880
So I have Reddit, I have NBA stuff, I have
dad jokes, and I have image generation.

45
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.849
What can I do with all three of those?

46
00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.796
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Find me a post on
Reddit that makes, no, no, no, no, no,

47
00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:15.820
cuz this one's random.

48
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.600
Hold on, let me see.

49
00:02:18.827 --> 00:02:23.810
What am I doing?

50
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.725
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why are we
not asking the AI for this?

51
00:02:25.725 --> 00:02:28.667
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] What am I doing?

52
00:02:28.667 --> 00:02:32.543
I have three tools,

53
00:02:32.543 --> 00:02:39.155
get all the posts from NBA Reddit,

54
00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:47.363
generate an image with a diffusion model,

55
00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:57.522
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And get a random dad joke.

56
00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:07.675
Make me a prompt I can use
that uses all three of these.

57
00:03:08.695 --> 00:03:09.425
Yeah, what are we doing?

58
00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.625
Why do I have to think about anything?

59
00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:13.415
Here we go.

60
00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:15.058
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Now,

61
00:03:15.058 --> 00:03:17.033
would you even need to have
told it about the tool?

62
00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:18.645
Just say,
give me a prompt that uses all the tools.

63
00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.419
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's true,
it already knows about the tools.

64
00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.157
I forgot i'm using the same
AI that generates the thing.

65
00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:26.689
I'm not good enough, I'm not worthy.

66
00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.460
Okay, let's workshop this one
cuz it doesn't know about NBA so

67
00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.991
we have fake that.

68
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:37.893
No, no.

69
00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:42.665
Okay, first, retrieve the latest
post from Reddit to gather

70
00:03:42.665 --> 00:03:45.436
trending topics and discussions.

71
00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:50.086
Then ,select a popular image
post related to the NBA.

72
00:03:50.086 --> 00:03:52.706
That should be fine,
cuz they're all from the NBA.

73
00:03:52.706 --> 00:03:55.906
Next, use that post as inspiration
to generate a meme image with

74
00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:56.923
a diffusion model.

75
00:03:56.923 --> 00:03:59.209
I don't have to say
with a diffusion model.

76
00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.329
Incorporating a funny or clever twist.

77
00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:07.409
Finally, add a random dad joke that
relates to basketball sports in general.

78
00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.520
It's not gonna be able to do that.

79
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.326
Or it might-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It'll just keep asking.

80
00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:12.742
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It'll just keep
asking it until it finds one.

81
00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:13.879
[LAUGH] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.082
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then it [INAUDIBLE].

83
00:04:15.082 --> 00:04:18.367
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right.

84
00:04:18.367 --> 00:04:19.523
I'm down.

85
00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:23.676
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay,

86
00:04:23.676 --> 00:04:27.370
it went and got a joke, I guess it's
satisfied with a joke that it has.

87
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.537
It's getting an image now.

88
00:04:29.537 --> 00:04:35.253
What happened, what happened?

89
00:04:35.253 --> 00:04:40.218
It tried to generate a bad image,
[LAUGH] I got moderated.

90
00:04:40.218 --> 00:04:43.769
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Reddit did that?

91
00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:50.357
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: My goodness,
that thing got moderated to hell.

92
00:04:51.627 --> 00:04:55.067
Your prompt may contain text that is
not allowed by our safety system.

93
00:04:55.067 --> 00:04:57.139
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We didn't log
the prompt it came up with.

94
00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.765
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Well,
it might already be in the database.

95
00:05:00.765 --> 00:05:02.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I bet.
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, let's see.

96
00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.450
I'm scared to look at it now.

97
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.427
I don't know if it's got moderated.

98
00:05:08.384 --> 00:05:10.935
&gt;&gt; Jamie: Ja Morant, that's why.

99
00:05:10.935 --> 00:05:14.948
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] Ja Morant,
he's got guns.

100
00:05:14.948 --> 00:05:20.775
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I mean, this looks fine.

101
00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:23.864
[INAUDIBLE] I wonder,
if it's probably copywritten.

102
00:05:23.864 --> 00:05:26.864
I wonder if it's copywritten,
I think that's why.

103
00:05:26.864 --> 00:05:30.293
It's probably copyright with the NBA and
using celebrities names.

104
00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:31.517
I think that's it, because-
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or

105
00:05:31.517 --> 00:05:32.681
maybe their jerseys number.

106
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:34.858
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, yeah,
I think it's copywritten because, I mean,

107
00:05:34.858 --> 00:05:36.524
he literally just did this last night.

108
00:05:36.524 --> 00:05:39.054
Ja Morant just did this
360 layup last night.

109
00:05:39.054 --> 00:05:40.904
So, that's funny.

110
00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:43.093
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's probably Will Smith,
honestly.

111
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.171
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] yeah.

112
00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:46.494
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cuz it says
Will Smith in the snow.

113
00:05:46.494 --> 00:05:47.008
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: It does.

114
00:05:47.008 --> 00:05:48.301
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Probably not Ja Morant.

115
00:05:48.301 --> 00:05:49.265
It's probably Will Smith.

116
00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.947
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: How do you
find Will Smith in the snow?

117
00:05:51.947 --> 00:05:53.884
Look for Fresh Prince.

118
00:05:53.884 --> 00:05:54.447
My God,.

119
00:05:54.447 --> 00:05:55.845
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That's pretty good, though.

120
00:05:55.845 --> 00:05:57.291
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That is pretty good.

121
00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.971
Okay, it did a good job.

122
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.031
It did a good job.

123
00:06:00.031 --> 00:06:03.592
But this is the case for
having local diffusion models so

124
00:06:03.592 --> 00:06:06.939
you don't get moderated to hell,
but yeah, okay.

125
00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:08.634
What you say, Jamie?

126
00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:11.694
&gt;&gt; Jamie: Did you just denied?

127
00:06:11.694 --> 00:06:15.227
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, I just got denied,
yeah, absolutely, pooped on.

128
00:06:15.227 --> 00:06:17.692
But, yeah, we have an agent, and

129
00:06:17.692 --> 00:06:22.292
it works pretty good under
the constraints in which it belongs.

130
00:06:22.292 --> 00:06:26.856
So I think that's really cool that
we could just AI all the way down,

131
00:06:26.856 --> 00:06:28.870
do some cool stuff like that.
