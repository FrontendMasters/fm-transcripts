00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.050
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
I'm gonna check out to Main.

2
00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.460
You don't have to do this, you can
just watch me do this, this part here.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.130
So again, like I said,
we're building an agent.

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.970
This agent is kinda cool.

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.118
It has the ability to read
the front page of Reddit,

6
00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:17.350
generate images and get random dad jokes.

7
00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.743
So [LAUGH] I don't know,

8
00:00:18.743 --> 00:00:22.936
a combination of those three things
you can do some pretty wacky stuff.

9
00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:24.776
I experimented with it the other day,

10
00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:28.817
and the results that I got from asking it
yourself, I was just like, what the hell?

11
00:00:28.817 --> 00:00:29.835
Why would you make that?

12
00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:32.757
It was just crazy, it was crazy.

13
00:00:32.757 --> 00:00:35.514
So cuz I mean, throw Reddit in there and
it's just like,

14
00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:39.027
you don't know what you're gonna
get on Reddit, and then you'll see.

15
00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:46.149
So the way you use it is, so
I have a command here in the package JSON.

16
00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.379
It should just be start.

17
00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.194
So you can just do npm start like this,
and

18
00:00:52.194 --> 00:00:55.909
then you can pass in a message like this.

19
00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.339
So I'm gonna say show me
a dad joke with an image.

20
00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.544
So I'll do this.

21
00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:05.786
You can see that the assistant is
thinking it ran the dad joke function.

22
00:01:05.786 --> 00:01:09.633
It's now generating an image [LAUGH].

23
00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.045
I don't know what we're gonna get.

24
00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:15.871
I don't know what dad joke you got, but
it's gonna try to make an image for

25
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:19.601
that dad joke, and then it'll give it
to us and then we can go look at it.

26
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:20.988
And then we can keep asking questions.

27
00:01:20.988 --> 00:01:22.818
So, here's a joke that I got.

28
00:01:22.818 --> 00:01:25.254
I used to work in a shoe recycling shop.

29
00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:29.301
It was soul destroying [LAUGH] okay?

30
00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:30.931
And then here's the image
that it generated.

31
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:35.638
[LAUGH] There it is, right?

32
00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:38.609
So it's like,
if you throw Reddit in there,

33
00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.200
it's gonna get real crazy real quick.

34
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.958
I'm almost hesitant to even do it.

35
00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:47.484
I did it one time, I was like,
okay, maybe not that [LAUGH].

36
00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:50.098
But as you can see,
it can get pretty cool.

37
00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:52.464
So, that's what we're gonna
be building and then, and

38
00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:54.402
you can continue to ask it questions,
right?

39
00:01:54.402 --> 00:01:57.488
It has memory and
knows your whole conversation.

40
00:01:57.488 --> 00:02:00.874
So you can be like, okay.

41
00:02:00.874 --> 00:02:04.504
What does that joke mean, right?

42
00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:08.647
If I literally didn't know what that
joke meant, I can just ask it and

43
00:02:08.647 --> 00:02:11.584
then it'll be like, okay, cool, idiot.

44
00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:15.336
There's a play on words here for soul and
soul, that's what the joke is about and

45
00:02:15.336 --> 00:02:16.726
it's trying to tell me that.

46
00:02:16.726 --> 00:02:21.923
So our agent, it has that power to be
able to connect to those things and

47
00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:26.518
then have a memory to remember
our conversation and do stuff.

48
00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:29.208
So that's what you're
gonna be building today.

49
00:02:29.208 --> 00:02:33.624
There's a lot that goes into this, from
chat history, memory running on a loop,

50
00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:36.588
executing tools, combining results.

51
00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:38.286
There's just so
much that kind of goes into it.

52
00:02:38.286 --> 00:02:41.593
But once you have the foundation,
it'd be really cool.

53
00:02:41.593 --> 00:02:45.895
So couple examples of I see of like,
agents in the wild.

54
00:02:45.895 --> 00:02:48.310
First, you gotta think about
two different types of agents,

55
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.145
there's conversational agents,
which we're gonna be building, and

56
00:02:51.145 --> 00:02:55.285
then there's transactional agents,
agents that are just like, one off things.

57
00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:57.916
Conversational agents,
really good use cases for

58
00:02:57.916 --> 00:03:00.862
those are the number one thing
that I see the most is like.

59
00:03:00.862 --> 00:03:03.909
You go on a website and
you see like the intercom bubble pop up or

60
00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:05.813
like some chat thing pop up.

61
00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:08.093
Everybody has AI thing there now, right?

62
00:03:08.093 --> 00:03:10.623
Because I can't remember like,
I don't know,

63
00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:14.883
maybe like 2014 you'd go to someone's
website and intercom thing pops up and

64
00:03:14.883 --> 00:03:17.573
it's like support teams
like offline right now.

65
00:03:17.573 --> 00:03:19.129
Okay, not with AI.

66
00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.409
Their support team is on all the time.

67
00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.812
So they can take this agent,

68
00:03:22.812 --> 00:03:25.969
they can train it on all their
customer support documentation,

69
00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:29.432
all their product documentation,
and then you can just chat with it.

70
00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:34.878
So I see a lot of that and that's not
just on a website in a chat interface,

71
00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:38.559
but it's also on a phone,
in a voice interface.

72
00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.796
It's also over email where
you're emailing an agent.

73
00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:44.898
Any way that you can communicate
via customer service,

74
00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:47.544
I'm starting to see it
being outsourced to AI.

75
00:03:47.544 --> 00:03:51.956
So that's probably the number one use
case for agents that are chat based.

76
00:03:51.956 --> 00:03:57.236
But you also see other things when it
comes to what I call vertical agents,

77
00:03:57.236 --> 00:04:02.174
so taking an agent, making it work for
this, just this one use case,

78
00:04:02.174 --> 00:04:07.565
like a common one was like, talk to
this PDF, or talk to this spreadsheet.

79
00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:11.318
You can take any document that has
data in it, or even a database, and

80
00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:13.535
be like, I wanna talk to this database.

81
00:04:13.535 --> 00:04:15.335
I wanna talk to this spreadsheet.

82
00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:19.527
That's a very common use case for like
an agent that's chat based, because it has

83
00:04:19.527 --> 00:04:23.934
access to that data source and it can
pull from it to answer questions for you.

84
00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:27.850
And if you wrote the other side of it,
it can write to it as well, which is,

85
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.535
I don't know, if you want your agent
writing SQL for you, go ahead.

86
00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:32.844
Yes, it can do that as well.

87
00:04:32.844 --> 00:04:34.124
There's literally nothing it can't do.

88
00:04:34.124 --> 00:04:37.684
So if you tell it to push the nuke button,
it will push the nuke button.

89
00:04:37.684 --> 00:04:40.112
So, don't tell it to push the nuke button.

90
00:04:40.112 --> 00:04:41.767
So you see a lot of agents in that way.

91
00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:43.687
Then you have like
the transactional agents.

92
00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:47.657
Those are just like what you would get in
a text editor, like a coding thing, right?

93
00:04:47.657 --> 00:04:54.730
So if I go in here and
I asked this to be like a,

94
00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.055
make a function that adds two numbers.

95
00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:03.684
It's a transactional thing.

96
00:05:03.684 --> 00:05:06.908
It does allow me to do like follow up
instructions and stuff like that, but

97
00:05:06.908 --> 00:05:08.319
it's not gonna remember this.

98
00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.567
It's not saving that anywhere.

99
00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:12.319
It's transactional.

100
00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.259
So you see a lot of that.

101
00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.989
It's just like one off task, another
good one is like the tools that are,

102
00:05:17.989 --> 00:05:20.983
go from design to code or
something like that.

103
00:05:20.983 --> 00:05:22.284
Those are very transactional.

104
00:05:22.284 --> 00:05:24.297
So you see those a lot as well.

105
00:05:24.297 --> 00:05:27.874
I would say a lot of those agents
are hidden where they're like,

106
00:05:27.874 --> 00:05:29.074
the AI is invisible.

107
00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:31.383
Like you don't know that it's doing
something for you in a background.

108
00:05:31.383 --> 00:05:35.999
You press this button in an email client
and it organized something for you or

109
00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.896
like, it's more like
the invisible compute.

110
00:05:38.896 --> 00:05:41.389
So I see a lot of those things
kind of hidden from the user.

111
00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:42.312
They feel more magical.

112
00:05:42.312 --> 00:05:44.146
You just just experience it.

113
00:05:44.146 --> 00:05:46.646
Whereas the chat ones
are literally in a chat interface.

114
00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.386
It's in the chat app.

115
00:05:47.386 --> 00:05:48.676
It's in your text messages.

116
00:05:48.676 --> 00:05:49.226
It's in Slack.

117
00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:50.226
It's in Discord.

118
00:05:50.226 --> 00:05:52.386
It's in a pop up bubble on your website.

119
00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:56.836
So yeah, tons of use cases for
agents, as you can see.

120
00:05:56.836 --> 00:06:02.036
Anything you can do as an engineer,
that you can write code for

121
00:06:02.036 --> 00:06:07.566
ahead of time and set it,
the AI can do that dynamically.

122
00:06:07.566 --> 00:06:11.592
So what I'm trying to describe is like,
if you're gonna write a code that hits

123
00:06:11.592 --> 00:06:15.810
the Stripe API that always goes to your
Stripe account and gets this information.

124
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.590
You can get the AI the same tools to
do that, and then it can decide when it

125
00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:25.689
should and how it should do that in
a dynamic way, whereas like you couldn't

126
00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:31.306
do that because you would have to write
it ahead of time and it can never change.

127
00:06:31.306 --> 00:06:33.166
Whereas the AI could change it on the fly.

128
00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:34.899
It can change the parameters of it.

129
00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:38.662
It's like,
imagine if you took an engineer and

130
00:06:38.662 --> 00:06:41.873
you deployed the engineer to AWS [LAUGH].

131
00:06:41.873 --> 00:06:45.128
And then you sent the engineer request,
and the engineer did all the work every

132
00:06:45.128 --> 00:06:48.380
time you sent it a request on the fly,
versus there's always some code that's

133
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.336
written ahead of time that's
running the same way every time.

134
00:06:51.336 --> 00:06:55.002
So the downside of that is that
it's non-deterministic, so

135
00:06:55.002 --> 00:06:59.036
you'll run the same thing and
get back a different answer.

136
00:06:59.036 --> 00:07:03.163
Which is something we've never had to deal
with in coding before, but now you do.

137
00:07:03.163 --> 00:07:06.076
So there's a lot of interesting
problems there now, yes?

138
00:07:06.076 --> 00:07:09.176
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What's the difference
between an agent and an assistant?

139
00:07:09.176 --> 00:07:11.120
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: The difference
between an agent and

140
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.396
an assistant is an assistant
can be a type of agent.

141
00:07:14.396 --> 00:07:17.416
But not all agents are assistants.

142
00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:20.877
I guess the way that I think about it
is an assistant is like, I think if

143
00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:24.802
an assistant is just like an LLM in
a chat interface, you can chat with it.

144
00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:26.778
It has memory,
you can chat with it, that's it.

145
00:07:26.778 --> 00:07:31.480
Agent is something to me that, and
I was gonna get into it later, but

146
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.602
essentially it's something
that can run on a loop.

147
00:07:35.602 --> 00:07:37.652
It has access to tools and
they can run on a loop.

148
00:07:37.652 --> 00:07:40.613
Not every assistant has access
to tools and can run on a loop.

149
00:07:40.613 --> 00:07:41.417
Some assistants.

150
00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:44.596
If you remember ChatGPT or
GPT 3.5 or ChatGPT,

151
00:07:44.596 --> 00:07:47.333
it didn't have tool calling or anything.

152
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.203
You just chatted with it.

153
00:07:48.203 --> 00:07:50.742
It couldn't access the outside world or
anything like that.

154
00:07:50.742 --> 00:07:52.547
That would be an assistant, in my opinion.

155
00:07:52.547 --> 00:07:56.493
It can help you with things, but
very limited up to its training data.

156
00:07:56.493 --> 00:07:59.664
If you try to ask it something
outside of its training cutoff data,

157
00:07:59.664 --> 00:08:01.259
it'd be like I don't know that.

158
00:08:01.259 --> 00:08:05.192
I've never seen that before, my training
date was this summer of whatever.

159
00:08:05.192 --> 00:08:09.461
But as soon as you add functions to it
where it can think, run a function, get

160
00:08:09.461 --> 00:08:14.367
an answer, decide to run another function,
maybe get an answer, ask you a question.

161
00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:19.206
Then you're starting getting into like an
agent, something that's running on a loop,

162
00:08:19.206 --> 00:08:21.527
and it's like thinking on what to do.

163
00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:25.273
An assistant can be an agent, but
not all agents are assistants,

164
00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:28.557
because you can also run
an agent not in a chat interface.

165
00:08:28.557 --> 00:08:31.016
And then at that point,
it's not really an assistant to me,

166
00:08:31.016 --> 00:08:32.477
it's just a transactional agent.

167
00:08:34.107 --> 00:08:38.016
That's my definition,
that is not what the internet says.

168
00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:40.815
These things are used interchangeably,
for sure.
