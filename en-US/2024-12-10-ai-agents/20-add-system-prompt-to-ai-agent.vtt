WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.596
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So the next one,
which is very short but important, and

2
00:00:02.596 --> 00:00:04.598
we touched on a lot, is the system prompt.

3
00:00:04.598 --> 00:00:08.598
So, system prompt,
this is where you can add instruction.

4
00:00:08.598 --> 00:00:12.232
So like, check it out, I'm gonna ask this
thing, wait, am I in a broken state?

5
00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:14.808
Let me check,
I might be in a broken state.

6
00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:16.051
I am.

7
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:17.438
You know how I know I'm in a broken state?

8
00:00:17.438 --> 00:00:20.466
Because the last message I got says,
generate this image,

9
00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:21.806
then it didn't, right?

10
00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:24.329
So I'm in a broken state.

11
00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.598
What I could do, I was trying to
demonstrate how I can show you how

12
00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:34.686
to handle the error, but
then I won't be able to do this well.

13
00:00:34.686 --> 00:00:38.406
I'm just gonna go back and
I'll just reset my stuff.

14
00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:43.995
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so, check this out.

15
00:00:43.995 --> 00:00:49.867
So if I say, not this,
that was really good though.

16
00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:54.711
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I feel like we should add
one thing and replace famous people or

17
00:00:54.711 --> 00:00:56.757
something generic.

18
00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:57.300
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Damn.

19
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.921
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You know what I mean,
that could still work.

20
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.384
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, let me see if
I can get it, okay, let's try it.

21
00:01:01.384 --> 00:01:06.582
Do not use famous,
I guess I could have just did it myself,

22
00:01:06.582 --> 00:01:09.776
but if it does, I'll do it myself.

23
00:01:09.776 --> 00:01:12.291
Do not use famous people's names.

24
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:14.911
&gt;&gt; Jamie: I mean, this is exactly
the kinda thing you'd put into a system

25
00:01:14.911 --> 00:01:17.255
prompt, be like, hey,
you're just overarching.

26
00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:17.760
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's a good idea.

27
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.519
Let's do that.

28
00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:20.542
I like that, system prompts, cool.

29
00:01:20.542 --> 00:01:25.682
So let's go into system prompts, and
we're just gonna export a string

30
00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:30.240
here that says system prompt,
and this thing is already on it.

31
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.669
The first thing I'm gonna say is,

32
00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:40.473
you are a helpful AI
assistant called Troll,

33
00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:43.694
[LAUGH] that is your name.

34
00:01:47.138 --> 00:01:50.483
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You,
what is, you are the troll?

35
00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:55.133
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jamie: You are the troll, the user.

36
00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:59.033
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] What?

37
00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:01.758
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] I mean, clearly,
that is the most likely next.

38
00:02:01.758 --> 00:02:03.336
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That is
the most likely thing.

39
00:02:03.336 --> 00:02:05.182
[LAUGH] That is the most likely thing.

40
00:02:05.182 --> 00:02:06.218
It makes sense.

41
00:02:06.218 --> 00:02:07.316
That's so funny.

42
00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:11.463
Okay, [LAUGH] my God.

43
00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:14.462
Okay, follow these rules.

44
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.371
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's so funny.

45
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.159
Follow these instructions.

46
00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.385
So the first thing is, what does it say?

47
00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:25.853
If you can complete the task correctly,
always maintain perfection.

48
00:02:25.853 --> 00:02:26.993
You can put whatever you want here.

49
00:02:26.993 --> 00:02:32.323
The things that I wanna focus on is,

50
00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:41.032
don't use celebrity names in
image Generation prompts,

51
00:02:41.032 --> 00:02:45.131
avoid all names, really.

52
00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:50.061
The next thing is, yeah,
let's just start with that for now,

53
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:54.898
but the other thing I wanna do
is- Maybe you replace names with

54
00:02:54.898 --> 00:02:59.107
generic characteristics
of the celebrity instead.

55
00:02:59.107 --> 00:03:04.567
Got you, don't use celebrity name in
image generation prompts, instead,

56
00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:10.284
replace, look at that, with generic
names and generic characteristics.

57
00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:11.704
[CROSSTALK] Got you.

58
00:03:11.704 --> 00:03:13.464
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Character traits, yeah.

59
00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:19.020
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Character traits, cool.

60
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.255
And then I wanna put some context.

61
00:03:23.255 --> 00:03:26.421
So typically what I do is,
I like to do XML.

62
00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:30.853
Well, do stuff like this,
I'm like, context, and

63
00:03:30.853 --> 00:03:35.589
then, some context I wanna put here is,
today's date.

64
00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.705
Without this, it has no concept of time.

65
00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:40.801
So if you ever ask it,
go find me my emails from tomorrow,

66
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:42.294
it has no idea what that is.

67
00:03:42.294 --> 00:03:46.968
So always put today's date in
this system prompts, so it knows.

68
00:03:46.968 --> 00:03:48.892
&gt;&gt; Jamie: You can bring in some XML back.

69
00:03:48.892 --> 00:03:49.925
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: XML is great.

70
00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:53.491
This is actually the solution to streaming
structured content, you can stream XML,

71
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:54.691
but you can't stream JSON.

72
00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:57.565
So it works pretty good.

73
00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:01.977
This is how they do it, and
all the GPT apps to claw, they stream XML.

74
00:04:01.977 --> 00:04:03.283
That's the secret.

75
00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:07.184
Yeah, I know, it's crazy.

76
00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:09.004
Cool, all right, let's try it.

77
00:04:09.004 --> 00:04:10.036
We gotta add the system prompt.

78
00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:11.305
So how do we add the system prompt?

79
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:14.558
We go into LLM,
we import our system prompt,

80
00:04:14.558 --> 00:04:19.358
like so, and we just add it to
the beginning of our messages array.

81
00:04:19.358 --> 00:04:21.131
It's always gonna be there.

82
00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:24.885
Its role is system.

83
00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:28.982
As long as its role is system and it's
the first thing in the array, you're good.

84
00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:31.050
And this is why I never
save this in the database,

85
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.127
because I tweaked the system prompt so
much, I don't wanna have to go and

86
00:04:34.127 --> 00:04:36.465
write a script to change
everybody's system prompt.

87
00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:38.541
I can just put it in a file.

88
00:04:38.541 --> 00:04:39.629
I can put it in a CMS.

89
00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.768
I can put it anywhere and
change it whenever I want, and it works.

90
00:04:43.768 --> 00:04:47.165
So that's just something I've learned,
never save the system prompt in

91
00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:50.140
the database, just always add it
to the beginning of the array.

92
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.056
Messages save in the database for
sure, but this, no,

93
00:04:53.056 --> 00:04:55.648
never put this in the database.

94
00:04:55.648 --> 00:04:58.570
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, let's try this now.

95
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.171
Am I clear on my database?

96
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:02.295
I am, okay.

97
00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:05.189
Okay, why did the basketball
team go to the bank?

98
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:08.114
Because they wanted to
get their bounce checks.

99
00:05:08.114 --> 00:05:11.071
No, okay, well, let's see.

100
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:14.615
Confident character in a basketball
jersey with a funny twist and

101
00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:15.974
idea of dunking, okay.

102
00:05:15.974 --> 00:05:24.539
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]

103
00:05:25.977 --> 00:05:27.418
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No.

104
00:05:27.418 --> 00:05:32.387
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: No, I think that's the one.

105
00:05:32.387 --> 00:05:34.531
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] That's the one.

106
00:05:34.531 --> 00:05:41.055
[LAUGH] What the hell, man?

107
00:05:41.055 --> 00:05:43.393
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: We're gonna
leave this one on the covers.

108
00:05:43.393 --> 00:05:44.695
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: My God.

109
00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:45.762
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For sure.

110
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.492
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: This one's good.

111
00:05:47.492 --> 00:05:50.548
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] That
one's gonna haunt me at night.

112
00:05:50.548 --> 00:05:52.342
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Whoa, man.

113
00:05:52.342 --> 00:05:58.395
Yeah, there you go,
[LAUGH] that's AI for you.

114
00:05:58.395 --> 00:06:03.718
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] Someone online just
says they just keep getting better and

115
00:06:03.718 --> 00:06:04.515
better.

116
00:06:04.515 --> 00:06:12.092
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: [LAUGH] [LAUGH] It's so
cringe.

117
00:06:12.092 --> 00:06:13.342
My God.

118
00:06:13.342 --> 00:06:18.368
Yeah, I think to to get around this,
what you would do is, you would try to

119
00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:23.820
coerce the prompt a little more, but
like, don't have this, have this.

120
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.806
And then, maybe you have another
model check that image to

121
00:06:28.806 --> 00:06:34.006
see how accurate or how good it was,
or something like that.

122
00:06:34.006 --> 00:06:38.066
If it wasn't that good, you run it again,
cuz there are models that will do that.

123
00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:42.450
But, yeah, [LAUGH] not this one.

124
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.001
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH] It's good
to rate its image prompts by

125
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:51.110
cringiness and-
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, I bet there is,

126
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:59.580
I 100% bet that there is a cringe [LAUGH]
diffusion model checker, I bet there is.

127
00:07:01.991 --> 00:07:03.053
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, I probably not text,

128
00:07:03.053 --> 00:07:05.682
I 100% know that there's probably
wanna hug you face somewhere.

129
00:07:05.682 --> 00:07:10.053
Okay, and that's system prompts, guys,

130
00:07:10.053 --> 00:07:14.315
that's how you make a good system prompt.

131
00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:20.333
Be sure to, and just to test this
part with the date, if I say like,

132
00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:27.218
let's erase all of this gibberish
because that prompt right there is like.

133
00:07:27.218 --> 00:07:28.894
This is one of those
prompts that you find and

134
00:07:28.894 --> 00:07:30.448
you know it's just gonna give you gold.

135
00:07:30.448 --> 00:07:34.741
So, what is the time and

136
00:07:34.741 --> 00:07:38.399
date and timezone?

137
00:07:42.648 --> 00:07:43.845
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, it says,

138
00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:49.772
I don't have access to real-time data
to provide the exact time or timezone.

139
00:07:49.772 --> 00:07:50.920
I did an ISO string.

140
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.421
Okay, I would have to give
it the time zone, but

141
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.183
you can see it got the right date.

142
00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:58.060
If I got rid of that,
I don't know if that's gonna be true.

143
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:04.550
Well, now it will, cuz it's in the message
history, but let me delete that.

144
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.100
I don't know if it's
gonna get the right one.

145
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.042
It may or may not, but it really depends
on what the servers are telling it.

146
00:08:14.457 --> 00:08:15.893
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah,
it was just like, nope.

147
00:08:15.893 --> 00:08:20.340
So that's a really good hack,
always include the current date.

148
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.610
If you can get the user's timezone,
what we do is, from the mobile device,

149
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.571
on every single request,
we send up the person's current timezone.

150
00:08:28.571 --> 00:08:30.384
And then we can get the date
from the server and

151
00:08:30.384 --> 00:08:33.555
we just convert it to their timezone,
and that's how we know what the time is.

152
00:08:33.555 --> 00:08:35.200
And we always include that.

153
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.806
So it's very helpful.

154
00:08:36.806 --> 00:08:39.268
And then we tell the AI
that that it's included, so

155
00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:42.383
it doesn't think that it can't get it,
it knows that it has it.

156
00:08:42.383 --> 00:08:46.284
You can also make it a tool, here's to
get the current time you could do it, but

157
00:08:46.284 --> 00:08:48.251
we realized we didn't need to do that.

158
00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:54.846
Cool, great, I think that might
be it as far as the code.

159
00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:59.256
The other things I wanna do is just
kinda cover, this is system prompts,

160
00:08:59.256 --> 00:09:02.963
talks about optimization strategies and
things like that.

161
00:09:02.963 --> 00:09:06.022
But I don't really know about this stuff,
to be honest,

162
00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:09.106
it's mostly everything we
kinda already talked about.

163
00:09:09.106 --> 00:09:12.276
It just goes through a really good
system prompt and how to add it.

164
00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:15.508
I already talked about cost and
things like that.

165
00:09:15.508 --> 00:09:18.017
So, there really isn't anything else.
