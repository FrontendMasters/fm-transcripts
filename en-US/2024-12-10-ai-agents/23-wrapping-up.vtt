00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.135
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well,
it sounds like we will recombine for

2
00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:05.680
some more advanced AI content.

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.310
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Yeah, taking something like
this and getting it ready for production.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.597
So what are all the steps
you need to take?

5
00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:15.863
Because right now this is great, but
you couldn't show this to users,

6
00:00:15.863 --> 00:00:17.288
it'll break, it'll be bad.

7
00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:22.276
So what else do you need to do to
make sure that this is resilience,

8
00:00:22.276 --> 00:00:23.832
and it's working.

9
00:00:23.832 --> 00:00:24.644
How do you know it's working?

10
00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:27.199
How do you measure that?

11
00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.865
Yeah, there's just a lot more
that you need to do that

12
00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:32.830
are more of it is AI related.

13
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.724
But a lot of it's just like all the things
that kind of surround the AI to make sure

14
00:00:37.724 --> 00:00:40.882
it's good, but
not directly correlated with AI.

15
00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:45.339
So,we'll mostly go inside because I feel
like there's a lot of tutorials out there,

16
00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.670
how to get started with the LLMs and
do stuff.

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.543
But no one's really showing you,
this is how I ship with it in production.

18
00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:52.950
So but I do, so
I wanna show you how I do it.

19
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.627
So that's what the course is for.

20
00:00:54.627 --> 00:00:56.795
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Cool, I think that's it,
thanks Scott, cool.

21
00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:00.864
