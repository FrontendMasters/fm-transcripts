1
00:00:00.402 --> 00:00:06.558
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: But yeah,
we got Reddit now, so that's good.

2
00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:08.463
Let's generate image.

3
00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:16.853
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: I'm just gonna
copy these things up here.

4
00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:20.482
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: There we go.

5
00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:23.073
We're gonna import OpenAI.

6
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:30.808
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: OpenAI from AI,
make our definition.

7
00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:34.276
We'll say, generate image.

8
00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:37.610
This one will have an argument,
it's gonna be the prompt.

9
00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:44.150
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So, where do you think
this prompt is gonna come from?

10
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.150
Do you think the user has
to type in this prompt?

11
00:00:48.985 --> 00:00:50.766
[INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: You said what?

12
00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:55.677
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The LLM will generate it
based on the user's initial prompt.

13
00:00:55.677 --> 00:01:00.913
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Exactly, the user is gonna
say something that, like, some condition

14
00:01:00.913 --> 00:01:07.128
that makes AI think it needs to call the
generate_prompt or generate_image tool.

15
00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:11.516
And then, because it has a prompt
parameter that's required,

16
00:01:11.516 --> 00:01:14.774
the AI now has to figure
out how to make a prompt.

17
00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:16.349
So this is where you can guide it.

18
00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:19.852
You can be like,

19
00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:25.607
prompt for the image,

20
00:01:25.607 --> 00:01:32.614
be sure to consider the user's,

21
00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:38.133
got to do back ticks.

22
00:01:40.397 --> 00:01:45.640
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Be sure to
consider the user's original

23
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.965
message when making the prompt.

24
00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:54.765
If you are unsure, then ask

25
00:01:54.765 --> 00:02:00.829
the user to provide more details.

26
00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.580
You can say whatever the hell you
want here, it doesn't matter.

27
00:02:06.482 --> 00:02:10.353
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, we got that.

28
00:02:10.353 --> 00:02:11.464
We got our type here.

29
00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:17.882
We're gonna infer
the generate_image tool definition.

30
00:02:17.882 --> 00:02:20.854
And then we're going to export

31
00:02:20.854 --> 00:02:25.605
const,
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Generate

32
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:29.398
image off of our tool function.

33
00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:44.484
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: That's a lot of work,
should have said tab.

34
00:02:44.484 --> 00:02:46.995
So then we have our tool args, and

35
00:02:46.995 --> 00:02:51.314
these tool args are gonna be
type-checked to fit these.

36
00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:54.003
Now I got tool args.prompt,
so I can do that.

37
00:02:54.003 --> 00:02:57.654
I also have the original user message
here if I wanted to do something here.

38
00:02:57.654 --> 00:03:01.193
Maybe, I mean, there's so many things.

39
00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:05.918
Maybe I could go and
I could add another thing here of score.

40
00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:06.968
And it tells me,

41
00:03:06.968 --> 00:03:11.696
how confident do you think the prompt
that you made is what the user wanted?

42
00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:16.889
And if it's not over a certain score, then
I can go down here with this user message

43
00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.253
and call another LLM, whose job is to make
a really good prompt for image generator.

44
00:03:22.253 --> 00:03:24.792
Get that thing and then pass it to, like,

45
00:03:24.792 --> 00:03:27.631
there's literally so
many things you can do.

46
00:03:27.631 --> 00:03:32.267
You can do whatever the hell you want,
it's just magic.

47
00:03:32.267 --> 00:03:33.083
But I'm not gonna do that.

48
00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:36.680
So now we're just going to call OpenAI.

49
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.175
That was pretty simple,
you just call the openai.images.generate,

50
00:03:40.175 --> 00:03:41.784
assuming you're using OpenAI.

51
00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:44.762
If you're not gonna use this,
again, you can try a different one,

52
00:03:44.762 --> 00:03:48.226
or replicate, or just not, just return
anything here, it doesn't matter.

53
00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:50.816
You just won't be able to use it,
it's totally fine.

54
00:03:50.816 --> 00:03:55.993
But I'm gonna use this, and
I'm gonna say, const response

55
00:04:00.477 --> 00:04:04.745
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Wait, openai., what is it?

56
00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:08.750
Images.generate.

57
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.036
Model, dall-e-3, and there we go.

58
00:04:12.036 --> 00:04:17.052
We have dall-e-3, the prompt is
whatever the AI said the prompt was.

59
00:04:17.052 --> 00:04:23.687
N is how many images you want, just
generate one, your wallet will thank you.

60
00:04:23.687 --> 00:04:27.632
[LAUGH] And the size,
I forgot what the other dimensions is, but

61
00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:31.146
you can make this smaller,
I'm sure it'll cost less.

62
00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.457
So we're gonna do that.

63
00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:37.745
And then the URL here, this will be
the URL to a hosted image that it has for

64
00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:40.189
us, so we can take a look at that.

65
00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:45.289
The next thing is, I'm going to make
a new file here, call it index.ts, and

66
00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.874
I'm just gonna import all those tools and
just export them, that did that so quick.

67
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.072
That's kind of crazy.

68
00:04:52.072 --> 00:04:55.515
So this is just, so I can just
pass around my tools as an array,

69
00:04:55.515 --> 00:04:59.625
versus one by one, since the agent and
the LLM both take an array of tools,

70
00:04:59.625 --> 00:05:01.378
it just makes sense to do that.

71
00:05:01.378 --> 00:05:05.212
So I'll do that, but not before
going back to the tool runner and

72
00:05:05.212 --> 00:05:08.274
getting rid of this garbage,
we don't need this.

73
00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:10.803
We also don't need this, so
I'm gonna get rid of that.

74
00:05:10.803 --> 00:05:16.279
And then I'm gonna import
all the tools one by one.

75
00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.463
So I'm gonna import

76
00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:26.371
generateImage from tools,

77
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:32.777
generateImage, there we go.

78
00:05:32.777 --> 00:05:35.242
And get those two like that.

79
00:05:35.242 --> 00:05:36.206
Why did you do that?

80
00:05:36.206 --> 00:05:37.350
Go away.

81
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.000
So now we have that, and then we can go
down here and add our switch statement.

82
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.362
So I can say, case, generateImage.name.

83
00:05:45.362 --> 00:05:46.131
It just did it.

84
00:05:48.847 --> 00:05:52.552
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So if the tool call
is whatever the name of this is,

85
00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:55.217
call the generateImage function.

86
00:05:55.217 --> 00:06:03.078
If it's the name of whatever this
Reddit one is, call the red one.

87
00:06:03.078 --> 00:06:04.570
No, no, this is wrong.

88
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.662
I need to get the definition.

89
00:06:06.662 --> 00:06:11.845
So, there we go, get the generateImage,
and this is hallucination at its best.

90
00:06:11.845 --> 00:06:15.082
It almost just killed our app.

91
00:06:15.082 --> 00:06:19.168
So, redditToolDefinition, and
then the dadJokeToolDefinition.

92
00:06:19.168 --> 00:06:20.746
There we go.

93
00:06:20.746 --> 00:06:26.014
So now I can say,
generateImageToolDefinition.name,

94
00:06:26.014 --> 00:06:30.100
and then redditToolDefinition.name, and

95
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.658
then dadJokeToolDefinition.name.

96
00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:37.133
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And
then throw an error here.

97
00:06:37.133 --> 00:06:42.057
I could also just like,
let's not throw an error in SSA.

98
00:06:44.665 --> 00:06:49.716
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Never run this tool again,
or else.

99
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.956
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: All right,
you really gotta let them know.

100
00:06:56.956 --> 00:06:59.064
Hold on.

101
00:06:59.064 --> 00:07:02.111
I want this to be in the message chat so
it can look back and reflect.

102
00:07:04.847 --> 00:07:09.461
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Cool, so
I'll tell the AI, stop doing that.

103
00:07:10.487 --> 00:07:14.184
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: Okay, so we got that,
the only thing we gotta do now is,

104
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:17.190
I think in the index is
just passing our tool.

105
00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.076
So, get rid of this.

106
00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:21.000
You get rid of that.

107
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.784
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: So
I say tools here, and then,

108
00:07:25.784 --> 00:07:29.694
import tools from tools, and that's it.

109
00:07:29.694 --> 00:07:32.041
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Should that be the tools or
the tool definitions?

110
00:07:32.041 --> 00:07:34.169
We already fixed that.

111
00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:35.877
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: What did I put in here?

112
00:07:35.877 --> 00:07:37.905
Yeah, this would have killed us.

113
00:07:37.905 --> 00:07:38.968
I need the tool definitions.

114
00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:43.007
So, generate tool definition,
redditToolDefinition,

115
00:07:43.007 --> 00:07:44.872
dadJokeToolDefinition.

116
00:07:50.268 --> 00:07:51.603
&gt;&gt; Scott Moss: And then fix those.

117
00:07:51.603 --> 00:07:52.387
So nice.
