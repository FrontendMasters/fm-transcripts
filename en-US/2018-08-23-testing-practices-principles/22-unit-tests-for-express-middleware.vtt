00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.806
&gt;&gt; Kent Dodds: But I think it'd be cool
to have you all do an exercise right now.

2
00:00:04.806 --> 00:00:09.520
Since, it looks like you wanna
use your fingers on the keyboard.

3
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.143
So for your stuff, you're actually
gonna be in this same area,

4
00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:17.101
you'll just be doing the post, not to do.

5
00:00:18.581 --> 00:00:22.278
&gt;&gt; Kent Dodds: And so to run those tests,
you'll be in watch mode,

6
00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:26.801
hit the p key, and
then controllers.*post.todo.

7
00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:33.854
And I've already kind of set things up for
you from the outline standpoint.

8
00:00:33.854 --> 00:00:41.133
Just do the first one, we'll just give you
ten minutes just to do this first one.

9
00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:46.962
And then, we'll come back and
I'll work through the solution.

10
00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:53.902
And then, we'll continue onto our next
subject about test object factories.
