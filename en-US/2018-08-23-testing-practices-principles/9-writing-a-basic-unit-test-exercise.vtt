&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: All right, so
I'm gonna set you off on this.

2
00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:10.301
So again, this is taking a user object,
and I've got an example of a user object.

3
00:00:10.301 --> 00:00:14.013
You can just un-comment that and
take that if you want to.

4
00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:18.779
But this is the user object and
by the end of your test it should

5
00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.743
only have the first two properties here,
the ID and username.

6
00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:28.067
The rest of these are considered safe
properties and they should be omitted.

7
00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:32.384
So you’ll call the user object with this
user, it’ll give you back a new user.

8
00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:37.213
And you’ll verify that that new user
doesn’t have the properties it's not

9
00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:38.428
supposed to have.
