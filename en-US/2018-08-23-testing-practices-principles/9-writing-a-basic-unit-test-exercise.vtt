&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
I'm gonna set you off on this, so again,

2
00:00:03.644 --> 00:00:09.122
this is taking a user object and
I've got an example of a user object,

3
00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:13.195
you can just and take that if you want to.

4
00:00:13.195 --> 00:00:17.700
But this is the user object and
by the end of your test,

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.827
it should only have the first two
properties here, the ID and Username.

6
00:00:23.827 --> 00:00:27.998
The rest of these are considered safe
properties, and they should be omitted.

7
00:00:27.998 --> 00:00:30.720
So you'll call the user
object with this user.

8
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.476
It'll give you back a new user, and
you'll verify that that new user doesn't

9
00:00:35.476 --> 00:00:38.448
have the properties it's
not supposed to have.
