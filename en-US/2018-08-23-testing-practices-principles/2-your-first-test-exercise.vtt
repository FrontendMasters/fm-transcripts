00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.766
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
what is a JavaScript Test?

2
00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:08.030
This is actually a link to a blog
that I posted a couple weeks ago,

3
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.972
back in January, where I basically have a
blog post forum of what we're about to do.

4
00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:18.677
But, now we're gonna jump into
the project, and you're gonna do this.

5
00:00:18.677 --> 00:00:20.594
So if you can open up your projects.

6
00:00:20.594 --> 00:00:25.526
Open up your terminal and
the project and your editor.

7
00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:31.957
We're gonna start in this other
directory and what's a test?

8
00:00:31.957 --> 00:00:37.185
And that you'll start in one.todo.js.

9
00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:43.654
And in here there are some comments to
explain what you're supposed to do.

10
00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:48.170
But the idea with all of these is that
you're going to write a framework,

11
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.069
and then you'll write
an assertion library.

12
00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.219
But this first one,

13
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.898
we're going to write the simplest form of
a test that you could possibly imagine.

14
00:00:58.208 --> 00:01:02.992
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And so to run this,
you're gonna want to change

15
00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:07.895
your directory into this
where we are right now so

16
00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:11.736
you'll cd into other what's a test?

17
00:01:11.736 --> 00:01:18.447
And then for each one of these it will
say and then run this code with and

18
00:01:18.447 --> 00:01:22.745
then command so for us it's node1.todo.

19
00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:27.612
And you'll know that you got it right when
your when running that actually throws

20
00:01:27.612 --> 00:01:30.702
a bug, or
it throws an error because there is a bug.

21
00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:33.114
Who found the bug?

22
00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:36.559
Yeah, Peter found it, what is it?

23
00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:39.687
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Sum is actually
subtracting and sum-

24
00:01:39.687 --> 00:01:40.804
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah.

25
00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:46.938
Yeah, so that's intentional because a huge
part of testing frameworks job is to,

26
00:01:46.938 --> 00:01:50.706
show you now the errors and
you get error messages so

27
00:01:50.706 --> 00:01:55.016
you can both know what's wrong and
also know how to fix it.

28
00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:58.860
And so, yeah so
sum is intentionally broken in this way.

29
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.409
So, what your job is to
write additional code,

30
00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.188
presumably after this code
to throw a useful error

31
00:02:08.188 --> 00:02:12.307
to validate whether sum is working or not.

32
00:02:12.307 --> 00:02:16.615
So you use sum and then you validate
that it is returning what it should be,

33
00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.132
an d if it's not, then you throw an error.
