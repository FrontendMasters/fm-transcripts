00:00:00.136 --> 00:00:02.590
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: So
what is a JavaScript Test?

2
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.911
This is actually a link to a blog
that I posted a couple weeks ago,

3
00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:14.826
back in January, where I basically have a
blog post form of what we're about to do.

4
00:00:14.826 --> 00:00:18.647
But now we're gonna jump into the project,
and you're gonna do this.

5
00:00:18.647 --> 00:00:23.147
So if you can open up your project,
open up your terminal and

6
00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:25.315
the project in your editor.

7
00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:30.148
We're gonna start in this other
directory and whats-a-test.

8
00:00:32.014 --> 00:00:37.910
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: And
you'll start in 1.todo.js.

9
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.209
And in here, there are some comments
to explain what you're supposed to do.

10
00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:48.311
But the idea is, with all of these,
is that you're going to write a framework,

11
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:51.296
and then you'll write
an assertion library.

12
00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:52.680
But this first one,

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.310
we're going to write the simplest form of
a test that you could possibly imagine.

14
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.321
And so to run this, you're gonna want
to change your directory into this,

15
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:11.800
where we are right now, so
you'll cd into other/whats-a-test.

16
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.765
And then for each one of these it'll say,

17
00:01:14.765 --> 00:01:18.000
then run this code with,
and then a command.

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.829
So for us it's node 1.todo.

19
00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.845
And you'll know that you got it right
when running that actually throws a bug,

20
00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:30.665
or throws an error,
because there is a bug.

21
00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:33.171
Who found the bug?

22
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:36.682
Yeah, Peter found it, what is it?

23
00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:39.715
&gt;&gt; Peter: Sum is actually subtracting,
it's not-

24
00:01:39.715 --> 00:01:40.977
&gt;&gt; Kent C. Dodds: Yeah, yeah, so

25
00:01:40.977 --> 00:01:46.121
that's intentional,
because a huge part of testing framework's

26
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:50.536
job is to show you the errors,
and you get error messages so

27
00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:54.976
you can both know what's wrong and
also know how to fix it.

28
00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:58.923
And so yeah, so
sum is intentionally broken in this way.

29
00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:03.053
So what your job is is to
write additional code,

30
00:02:03.053 --> 00:02:07.288
presumably after this code,
to throw an error,

31
00:02:07.288 --> 00:02:12.475
a useful error,
to validate whether sum is working or not.

32
00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:17.325
So you use sum, and then you validate
that it is returning what it should be.

33
00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:19.132
And if it's not, then you throw an error.
