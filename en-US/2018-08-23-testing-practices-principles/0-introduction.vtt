1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.691
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, hi everyone.

2
00:00:02.691 --> 00:00:07.788
So my name's Kent C Dodds and
this is some information about me.

3
00:00:07.788 --> 00:00:11.958
Each one of these little things is linked,
including a cute picture of my puppy.

4
00:00:11.958 --> 00:00:17.448
My oldest is not even six yet, so
I don't know why we got a puppy,

5
00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:20.932
but we did and now we're happy with her.

6
00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:24.135
But, yeah, so my slides are right here.

7
00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:30.813
Kcd.im/tp/slides and
you can get all the links and stuff.

8
00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:34.040
There isn't a whole lot
to my slides beyond this.

9
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.849
There are a couple of useful things and
some resources that I link to, but for

10
00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:43.372
the most part, most of our time is
gonna be spent in the repo anyways so.

11
00:00:43.372 --> 00:00:46.902
Which is open source,
you'll have access to that forever.

12
00:00:46.902 --> 00:00:50.223
Okay, cool, so
I like to set up expectations so

13
00:00:50.223 --> 00:00:54.714
that you're not waiting for
something and then it never comes.

14
00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:58.394
So let's talk about what this talk is.

15
00:00:58.394 --> 00:01:02.782
We're gonna be talking about
the fundamentals behind tests and testing.

16
00:01:02.782 --> 00:01:06.672
So we're actually going to write
a testing framework in assertion library.

17
00:01:06.672 --> 00:01:08.634
That's the first thing
we're gonna do today.

18
00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:13.452
So that you really get understanding
of what testing really is.

19
00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:16.492
Another thing that I didn't mention but

20
00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:20.348
I probably should is this
is all JavaScript stuff.

21
00:01:20.348 --> 00:01:23.533
So if you're not experienced
with JavaScript at all,

22
00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.758
you're gonna struggle a little bit.

23
00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:30.470
I had somebody come to a workshop like
this recently who knew nothing about

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.337
JaveScript and it was a little bit of
a struggle for them to do the exercises.

25
00:01:35.337 --> 00:01:37.949
So hopefully you're
familiar with JavaScript,

26
00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:41.688
if you're not then get your friend to
come and help you with the syntax.

27
00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:44.986
JavaScript is the best language anyway,
so you should learn it.

28
00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:49.347
So we're gonna talk about
different forms of testing,

29
00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:52.703
not all forms of testing, there are many.

30
00:01:52.703 --> 00:01:57.022
The two that we're focusing on today
are unit and integration testing.

31
00:01:57.022 --> 00:02:00.062
This is more like practices and
principles, so

32
00:02:00.062 --> 00:02:03.866
lots of these things can apply
to various forms of testing.

33
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.211
These are just the two that
we'll be focusing on today.

34
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.561
And we'll definitely cover test doubles or
mocks, spies, stubs,

35
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:13.039
whatever you wanna call those things.

36
00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:16.625
We'll be talking about that,
what those really are and

37
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:19.075
in what situations they're useful.

38
00:02:19.075 --> 00:02:22.919
We'll talk about test driven development.

39
00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.690
We're not gonna be talking about all of
the different methodologies of testing,

40
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.992
but TDD is one that I've found to be
pretty useful in certain situations.

41
00:02:31.992 --> 00:02:37.882
And then yeah, just hopefully this
gives you some core principles to help

42
00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:43.784
you write tests that'll give you
confidence and also are maintainable.

43
00:02:43.784 --> 00:02:48.603
So I'm gonna try and
avoid technology specific stuff there.

44
00:02:48.603 --> 00:02:51.306
We're going to be using
specific frameworks and stuff.

45
00:02:51.306 --> 00:02:54.855
And so you will need to learn
at least the assertion library,

46
00:02:54.855 --> 00:02:57.298
and how to use the framework a little bit.

47
00:02:57.298 --> 00:03:02.292
But the technology specific stuff is for
my other workshop with testing react.

48
00:03:02.292 --> 00:03:05.974
We're not going to configure any tools,
it's all preconfigured for you and

49
00:03:05.974 --> 00:03:06.658
everything.

50
00:03:06.658 --> 00:03:11.325
And testing is one subject that

51
00:03:11.325 --> 00:03:16.178
has a huge variety of opinions.

52
00:03:16.178 --> 00:03:18.202
And that is not lost on me,

53
00:03:18.202 --> 00:03:22.635
I have a lot of opinions based
off my experience testing.

54
00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:28.785
And I know several people, I just spoke at
a conference all about testing Javascript,

55
00:03:28.785 --> 00:03:33.853
and it was like every other talk was
disagreeing with the previous one.

56
00:03:33.853 --> 00:03:36.617
It was so many opinions about testing.

57
00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:39.878
So there are tradeoffs
everywhere in software.

58
00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:43.165
In particular with testing
there are tons of tradeoffs.

59
00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:47.906
So I'll be giving you my opinions of
things that I have seen that have made it

60
00:03:47.906 --> 00:03:53.269
easier for me to maintain tests, and that
give me confidence that I'm looking for.

61
00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.914
And like I said earlier, we're not
covering all the forms of testing,

62
00:03:56.914 --> 00:03:57.902
just a select few.

63
00:03:57.902 --> 00:04:01.315
So if you haven't set up the work shop,
make sure that you do that.

64
00:04:01.315 --> 00:04:04.949
It's going to take a fair
amount of time to set it up.

65
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.131
Just because that's the way it is.

66
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:11.938
The workshop is pretty big.

67
00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:16.872
It's actually an application where
I'm trying to balance the line

68
00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:22.075
between totally practical but
not too confusing and domain specific.

69
00:04:22.075 --> 00:04:26.411
And so you are installing an app,
but it also has several other,

70
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:31.571
this other directory that has some other
stuff in it for specific examples.

71
00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:35.866
So yeah, this may take a fair amount
of time for you to install, but

72
00:04:35.866 --> 00:04:39.411
once that's done you should be all set and
ready to go.

73
00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:43.873
If you are struggling with that
a little bit, I'll be in the chat and

74
00:04:43.873 --> 00:04:47.567
in here helping people out
during exercises and stuff.

75
00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:53.114
Yeah, for many of the exercise, not all
of them but for many of the exercises

76
00:04:53.114 --> 00:04:58.500
there's a test at the bottom that has
a link to elaboration and feedback.

77
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.630
This is scientifically proven that
when you reiterate the things that

78
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.970
you have been taught, that you'll
remember those things better, and so

79
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.725
that's why I have this form.

80
00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.440
That's why I added it to my workshops.

81
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.249
So it gives you an opportunity
to type out what it is that you

82
00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:18.616
learned from the exercise.

83
00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:23.017
And that will just help
solidify things in your mind.

84
00:05:23.017 --> 00:05:26.562
&gt;&gt; Mark: If you're watching it as
a course, use the notes feature and

85
00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:28.032
take notes to yourself.

86
00:05:28.032 --> 00:05:29.031
&gt;&gt; Kent C Dodds: Yeah, thanks, Mark.

87
00:05:29.031 --> 00:05:31.006
Yeah, I gotta think about that too.

88
00:05:31.006 --> 00:05:34.667
Feel free to still submit
the feedback if you want to, but

89
00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:39.259
yeah the notes feature would be a good
place to take those notes as well.

90
00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:44.151
And then if you have any questions for
me that aren't really related to this,

91
00:05:44.151 --> 00:05:46.573
I do have an ask me anything on GitHub.

92
00:05:46.573 --> 00:05:51.160
Several hundreds of questions on there,
that you could read through and

93
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.838
ask additional questions if they're
not relevant to today's subject.

94
00:05:55.838 --> 00:05:57.579
And then I tweet sometimes.

95
00:05:57.579 --> 00:06:01.487
Actually, I tweet like, all the time,
I'm constantly tweeting all the time.

96
00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:05.200
So if you're interested
in JavaScript react and

97
00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.009
how cute my dog is, yeah,
I don't tweet about my dog too much.

98
00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.730
Okay, so the routine that we're gonna go
through is that I'm gonna demo something,

99
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.486
a principle or practice.

100
00:06:17.486 --> 00:06:21.613
And, well, this is a general routine,
not all of them will follow this.

101
00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:24.323
But in general, I'll demo something.

102
00:06:24.323 --> 00:06:29.211
I'll introduce you to the exercise, and
then set you loose on the exercise.

103
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:32.717
I'll show you how to run the tests and
everything to get that exercise going.

104
00:06:32.717 --> 00:06:36.991
If you can, pair program with
somebody on the exercise.

105
00:06:36.991 --> 00:06:40.623
You don't both have to be working
through the exercise on your computer,

106
00:06:40.623 --> 00:06:42.506
you can be on one person's computer.

107
00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:46.604
So if you are interested in doing that I
recommend it because it's a real great

108
00:06:46.604 --> 00:06:49.773
way for both of you to solidify
when you are understanding.

109
00:06:49.773 --> 00:06:52.803
You have to talk through what
your assumptions are and

110
00:06:52.803 --> 00:06:55.172
you can correct each other assumptions.

111
00:06:55.172 --> 00:06:58.538
So pair programming
the exercises is a great way

112
00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:01.408
to solidify your understanding there.

113
00:07:01.408 --> 00:07:04.415
Make sure to fill out the elaboration.

114
00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:05.832
That'll help you solidify things.

115
00:07:05.832 --> 00:07:09.556
For some of the exercises there's
a bonus test that you can

116
00:07:09.556 --> 00:07:13.517
implement additional stuff,
implement additional tests.

117
00:07:13.517 --> 00:07:16.804
And look for opportunities to help others.

118
00:07:16.804 --> 00:07:20.902
So let me let you in on a little secret.

119
00:07:20.902 --> 00:07:23.313
So when I give these workshops,

120
00:07:23.313 --> 00:07:27.253
this is actually just a part
of my learning process.

121
00:07:27.253 --> 00:07:32.040
So I'm in the process of learning testing
and the process of learning React.

122
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.541
And a really important part of my
process is to teach what I'm learning

123
00:07:36.541 --> 00:07:40.525
to other people and
that's how I solidify my understanding.

124
00:07:40.525 --> 00:07:45.331
So I wouldn't have had nearly as much
experience with this stuff if I didn't

125
00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:48.421
have to prepare this
workshop to give to you all.

126
00:07:48.421 --> 00:07:52.600
And I want to work really hard to
make sure it's really great content.

127
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:57.228
And so when you try to take
the things you've learned and

128
00:07:57.228 --> 00:07:59.394
teach it to other people,

129
00:07:59.394 --> 00:08:04.629
it will help solidify that
understanding in your mind as well.

130
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:09.180
Clear up some misconceived assumptions
that you have and that kind of thing.

131
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.916
So if you notice somebody's
struggling with something, look for

132
00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:14.591
an opportunity to help them.

133
00:08:14.591 --> 00:08:18.910
And if you notice something weird in the
repository or typo or anything like that,

134
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.547
feel free to make pro request.

135
00:08:20.547 --> 00:08:24.100
It's totally open source and
several people have actually done that.
