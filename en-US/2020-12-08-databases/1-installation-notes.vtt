00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.361
We're gonna be going over four
different databases today.

2
00:00:03.361 --> 00:00:09.881
We're gonna be going over MongoDB,
Postgres, Neo4J and Redis.

3
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:15.493
I chose these four, one, partially, just
because those are the ones I'm familiar

4
00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:20.472
with but also partially cuz I do believe
that those are gonna be the four most

5
00:00:20.472 --> 00:00:25.874
common options and each of these kind of
silos that we're gonna be looking into.

6
00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:29.815
I'm very careful to pin the versions
here so I wrote down these versions.

7
00:00:29.815 --> 00:00:33.645
Because if you take this course in
the future and these versions kinda move

8
00:00:33.645 --> 00:00:37.310
forward, some of the commands now
might not work anymore, right?

9
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.740
Because they change the APIs,
they improve them and things like that.

10
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.292
So you can feel free to try but

11
00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:47.710
just be aware some things might break
if you use a future version of these.

12
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.556
As of writing as of today,
these are the most current versions.

13
00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:53.930
Or at least the most current
versions I could get on Docker.

14
00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.478
So yeah, just be aware of versions and
I'm gonna emphasize that again,

15
00:00:59.478 --> 00:01:03.929
just be aware of the versions because this
always happens where people come back and

16
00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.410
say your course is broken.

17
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.855
It kind of, anyway, just make sure
you get in the right version.

18
00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:15.310
Okay, so
databases are actually quite large.

19
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.430
They're pretty big pieces of software.

20
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.710
So you have several options
on how to download them.

21
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.680
I'm gonna be using Docker all day
because it makes it very, very easy.

22
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.010
And you don't have to understand Docker.

23
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.790
I will give you all of the commands
that you need to run it will run

24
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.940
on both windows.

25
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.648
It will run on Mac OS I
am obviously on Mac OS,

26
00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:40.440
you can see I have my Windows laptop here,
so I have tried these as well on Windows.

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.607
So I'm gonna suggest that you use Docker.

28
00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:49.008
So if you haven't downloaded Docker
desktop, I dropped a link in there,

29
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.590
but you can also just search for
Docker desktop.

30
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.460
Go ahead and go and
install Docker desktop.

31
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.637
Should be looks like something like this,
you'll download it.

32
00:01:59.637 --> 00:02:03.290
Docker desktop will work for
both Mac OS and for Windows.

33
00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.980
If you're on Linux, I assume you probably
already know how to operate Docker.

34
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.330
It's probably a pretty safe assumption.

35
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.038
So I'm gonna say far and
above easiest thing to do,

36
00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:20.228
download Docker desktop use that.

37
00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:22.887
There are some other options if
you don't feel like using Docker.

38
00:02:22.887 --> 00:02:28.739
One's gonna be using a package manager
like Homebrew or Winget or Chocolatey and

39
00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.484
you can kind of brew, install MongoDB,
that would work as well.

40
00:02:33.484 --> 00:02:37.290
For Linux, you'll be using whatever Distro
like AppGet or whatever that you're using.

41
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.176
You can go and just download
the entire binary yourself for

42
00:02:42.176 --> 00:02:45.830
each of these desktops, or
for all of these databases.

43
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.264
So I dropped links in there for
those, some of these actually have

44
00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:52.900
desktop clients, like I know Neo4j
has a separate desktop client.

45
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.250
I think Postgres does as well.

46
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.280
I think Redis does as well.

47
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.160
They actually might all have their
own individual desktop clients.

48
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.360
I have not used them.

49
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.464
So use at your own risk.

50
00:03:03.802 --> 00:03:07.514
If you're on something like
a Chromebook or something like really,

51
00:03:07.514 --> 00:03:10.778
really lightweight that would
not be able to run a database,

52
00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:14.684
something you could do is you could
spin up like a cloud version, right?

53
00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:20.069
So you could go to like MongoDB Atlas and
spin up a cloud version of this.

54
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.381
You're gonna run into
some difficulties and

55
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.022
I wouldn't know how to advise
you on how to do that but

56
00:03:26.022 --> 00:03:29.640
it's a possibility if your computer
can simply cannot run a database.

57
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.740
Lastly, we're gonna be running some code
samples that those will be in node.js.

58
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.575
Just be above version
10 you should be fine,

59
00:03:39.575 --> 00:03:41.500
I'm not really doing
anything too wild here.

60
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.519
I think I'm on 12.18.4 which I think is
the latest LTS as of like last week or

61
00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.400
something like that.

62
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.239
But again, as long as you're above two 12,

63
00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.158
I think 15 just came out this week,
so any one of those should be fine.

64
00:03:58.158 --> 00:03:59.245
Cool.

65
00:03:59.245 --> 00:04:03.018
And then you can install
that via the node website or

66
00:04:03.018 --> 00:04:08.215
I use nvm which is a node version manager,
what I would suggest to you.

67
00:04:08.215 --> 00:04:12.912
Okay, so that's kind of like all of the
various different things as long as you

68
00:04:12.912 --> 00:04:17.060
get Docker desktop installed,
you won't have to do anything else.

69
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.680
I'll show you everything on the fly of
how to get stuff running through Docker.
