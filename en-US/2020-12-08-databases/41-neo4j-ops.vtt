00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.710
So admittedly, I know even less about
how to run Neo4j in production.

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.302
The one thing I did want to call
out is how it's licensed so

3
00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:09.880
like a consideration around that.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.811
Neo4j is licensed to run as
the Community Edition for free,

5
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:17.890
as long as you're only
running it as one server.

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.290
Which for the most part means
that you as a hobbyist or

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.350
as a very small company can run Neo4j.

8
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.158
But as soon as you want
to do a clustered server.

9
00:00:29.158 --> 00:00:32.998
Which basically means any sort of
like real production, deployment.

10
00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:35.413
You have to pay the Neo4j
company money for

11
00:00:35.413 --> 00:00:38.509
that licence to run those
particular kinds of things.

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.614
Honestly, like I think it's fine like they
have an entire team that works on Neo4j.

13
00:00:43.614 --> 00:00:46.220
I think it's fine for
them to get paid for their work.

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.289
They also have a bunch of
other like enterprising stuff,

15
00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.430
they can do like
Active Directory Integrations.

16
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.910
They have unlimited size.

17
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.720
Community Edition does have a size cap.

18
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.030
It's very large but
that does have a size cap.

19
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.077
The other really big thing is the
Community Edition can only do backups if

20
00:01:03.077 --> 00:01:05.070
you take down the server.

21
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.700
Whereas the enterprise one can do stay
up the entire time and still do backups.

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.554
So just be aware, it's a company,

23
00:01:13.554 --> 00:01:18.130
they're trying to make money,
but think that's okay.

24
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.510
Beyond that they just have,
primaries and secondaries.

25
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.870
They also have the idea of sharding and
things like that.

26
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.900
So kind of all the things that you would
expect based on the other databases we've

27
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.500
worked with
