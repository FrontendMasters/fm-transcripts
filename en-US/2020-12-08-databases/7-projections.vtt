1
00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.100
So let's talk about projections.

2
00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.131
What's fun about these is, you're gonna
learn all these concepts once and

3
00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:08.881
then we're gonna go to
the next database and

4
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:11.072
a lot of these concepts being
almost exactly the same.

5
00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:14.503
So projections exist in all
of these different databases.

6
00:00:14.503 --> 00:00:16.353
It's probably something you've
actually done before and

7
00:00:16.353 --> 00:00:18.640
you didn't know that there was a term for
it.

8
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.898
So let's say we wanted to
go find all the dogs but

9
00:00:21.898 --> 00:00:24.267
we only wanted to see their names.

10
00:00:24.267 --> 00:00:26.200
We don't actually wanna see
anything else about them.

11
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.324
We just wanna return their names,

12
00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.003
we use something called
the projection to do that.

13
00:00:29.003 --> 00:00:31.002
So I'm gonna say db.pets.find.

14
00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:34.700
I'm gonna say type, dog.

15
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.690
And we're gonna end that object.

16
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.400
We're gonna provide a second
parameter to this find query here.

17
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.530
And all we wanna do is get the name.

18
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.575
So we're gonna say name.

19
00:00:52.575 --> 00:00:54.916
And here you can put a lot of things.

20
00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:56.733
You can put true.

21
00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.757
You can put 1.

22
00:00:57.757 --> 00:00:59.059
I end up normally putting 1.

23
00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.311
I think that's just from habit.

24
00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:04.093
But whatever you want to include in
your results, you just put that.

25
00:01:04.093 --> 00:01:09.376
And I'm just gonna say here limit 5 so
we don't get a tonne of things back.

26
00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:12.807
And you can see here,
all we're getting back is a name,

27
00:01:12.807 --> 00:01:16.720
whereas up here we're getting
the whole object back.

28
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.656
Now, here's a bit of advice for

29
00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:23.100
you when you're writing your
particular database queries.

30
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.730
Do the projections, right?

31
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.860
Only include the things that you need for
your query, don't include other things.

32
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.193
It's a security thing, which is useful
that if someone can get into your app

33
00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:35.700
server, they can't see data flowing in and
out of it.

34
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.240
You'll notice that this is just
smaller in general, right?

35
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.230
So you'll end up using less bandwidth.

36
00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.384
It's just a good idea to always only
include the things that you need,

37
00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:46.420
don't include things that you don't need.

38
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.185
So even in this particular case,
notice it's included the ID.

39
00:01:49.185 --> 00:01:50.920
It does that by default no matter what.

40
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.406
If I want to not include that,
you can actually come in here and

41
00:01:54.406 --> 00:01:56.160
specifically disallow that.

42
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.650
So if I put negative -1 there or
false, both of those would work.

43
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.150
You can see.

44
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.402
It should not include that.

45
00:02:04.402 --> 00:02:05.790
It's 0, it's not include.

46
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.224
So there you go.

47
00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:14.388
That way, we actually even
disinclude the _ID as well.

48
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:24.914
So just to prove my point here,
you can also say name: true,

49
00:02:24.914 --> 00:02:28.150
breed: true, I'm gonna do ID: false.

50
00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:33.590
So all of those work as well.

51
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.600
And another thing that you can do as well,
you can actually just disinclude things.

52
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.850
So if I do ID false like that,
it'll include everything else.

53
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.347
So that's kind of takes a disallow list
kind of approach to projection as well

54
00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:54.410
that is like, specifically don't include
these things, include everything else.

55
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.283
So let's say you're querying a user
database that has their password hash in

56
00:02:57.283 --> 00:03:00.110
it, you could specifically just disinclude
that if you don't need that for

57
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.790
whatever you're doing.

58
00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.283
So that's a lot of what's
about querying MongoDB.

59
00:03:06.283 --> 00:03:09.767
So at this point, you're probably pretty
well equipped to just go out there and

60
00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:11.070
start reading from MongoDB.

61
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.200
The nice thing about learning these
databases is 85% of the use case can

62
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.527
be learned in about, I don't know how
long we've been talking about now, or

63
00:03:19.527 --> 00:03:21.160
something like that.

64
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:27.230
And then there's a very long tail of
really wild stuff that they can do.

65
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.520
So we'll talk a little
bit about the wild stuff.

66
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.494
But for the most part one,

67
00:03:30.494 --> 00:03:33.327
you'd to be familiar with all these
different databases so that you can make

68
00:03:33.327 --> 00:03:35.820
intelligent decisions about which
one you wanna use for your app.
