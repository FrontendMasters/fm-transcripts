00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.650
My name is Brian Holt and welcome
to the Complete Intro To Databases.

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.090
Greetings from very snowy Minneapolis.

3
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.095
I don't know why I keep
coming to the city,

4
00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:12.126
every time I come it
just wants me to leave.

5
00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:17.374
[LAUGH] Yeah, and
I pumped to be back on Frontend Masters

6
00:00:17.374 --> 00:00:20.920
talking about databases this time.

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.130
I've talked about Linux,
I've talked about the command line.

8
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.491
I've talked about containers, react,
algorithms, intro to web Dev, Boot camp,

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:34.050
I'm really taking a trip through
Memory Lane comparative frameworks.

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.520
That was the first one using years ago.

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.700
Today we're gonna be talking about one of
my favorite topics, which is databases.

12
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.070
So yeah, let's just go ahead and
get started.

13
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.914
The first thing I want you to see here, is
I have this nice little course website if

14
00:00:50.914 --> 00:00:53.478
you've taken one of my previous courses,

15
00:00:53.478 --> 00:00:56.940
the format should look
relatively familiar to you.

16
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.350
You'll see here that we have some very
lovely artwork from Alice Pearson.

17
00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.405
She does all the work for
all my courses and

18
00:01:04.405 --> 00:01:07.060
this is probably my favourite
one she's done so far.

19
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.020
So let's go ahead and
get into some introductions.

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.616
So I've been working in the field for
over a decade at this point, and

21
00:01:16.616 --> 00:01:20.217
I've used a variety of databases
across my various different jobs.

22
00:01:20.217 --> 00:01:24.707
And so I'm excited to share with you some
of my hard won battle knowledge that I've

23
00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:28.890
gotten from crashing databases,
dropping tables when I shouldn't have.

24
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.897
Literally my first week at my first job,

25
00:01:30.897 --> 00:01:34.573
I dropped an entire MySQL database
that I was definitely not supposed to.

26
00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:38.568
So I'm gonna teach you how to not do that.

27
00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:41.630
And I just I think databases are fun.

28
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.300
Maybe it's just being a glutton for
punishment, but

29
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.800
I do enjoy actually
interacting with databases.

30
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.880
That's what I do on my free time.

31
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.993
It's actually not true,
I don't do this in my free time but

32
00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:51.061
I do enjoy this part of my job.

33
00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.479
Cool.

34
00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.276
So who is this course for?

35
00:01:56.276 --> 00:01:58.923
This course is for
I'm hoping everyone, right?

36
00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:02.600
Everyone, I think can gather
some knowledge from this.

37
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.528
Just kind of understanding the various
kinds of databases that are available to

38
00:02:06.528 --> 00:02:08.814
when you would choose one,
how to choose one,

39
00:02:08.814 --> 00:02:12.410
what kind of tradeoffs you're making
by choosing one versus the other?

40
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.049
This course is most useful if you have at
least a little bit of familiarity with

41
00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.730
the command line.

42
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.540
Luckily Frontend Masters has a fantastic
course on Linux on the command line.

43
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.040
Also, it's the one that I taught.

44
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.610
So I think it's good.

45
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.553
But anyway, so if you don't have familiar
with the command line, I recommend you

46
00:02:31.553 --> 00:02:34.825
take Take that course first, and
then this one will be a lot easier.

47
00:02:34.825 --> 00:02:39.565
Cuz you won't have to be learning a bunch
of command lines at the same time.

48
00:02:39.565 --> 00:02:41.485
I'll also be using
containers in this course.

49
00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:45.246
There's also another [LAUGH] course from
Frontend Masters that I think's pretty

50
00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:48.130
good on containers,
I also taught that one.

51
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.520
You don't have to take down unnecessarily.

52
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.341
This course is not centered on containers.

53
00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:53.470
You will be running some Docker commands.

54
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.086
But you don't need to understand what
the Docker commands actually do.

55
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.200
And then a little bit of
programming knowledge.

56
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.114
All the samples will be in Node.js,
that's what I know.

57
00:03:04.114 --> 00:03:05.611
If you're on Frontend Masters,

58
00:03:05.611 --> 00:03:09.140
decent chance you have a little
bit of familiar with JavaScript.

59
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.240
But even if you don't, it's fine.

60
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.703
If you know Ruby, if you know Python,
if you know Go, these code samples

61
00:03:15.703 --> 00:03:21.540
are going to be simple enough that you
should be able to pick them up just fine.

62
00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.690
Great, yeah.

63
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.574
Beyond that, this course should be helpful
to anyone that's either coming from

64
00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:28.627
the front end or
coming from the back end and

65
00:03:28.627 --> 00:03:32.011
just wants to learn a little bit more
how and where to stick store data.

66
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:35.668
All right, who am I?

67
00:03:35.668 --> 00:03:36.740
So I'm Brian.

68
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.119
I work at Microsoft as a principal
Program Manager on Visual Studio code and

69
00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.910
the developer experience for
JavaScript users on Azure.

70
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.765
Primarily I work on the Azure stuff.

71
00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:50.540
I've been a developer for a decade.

72
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.239
Kind of the thing that's
kind of full circle for

73
00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.840
me this entire thing is my father
actually worked on a database at IBM.

74
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.474
So my dad worked on and DB2,
which is the IBM SQL database.

75
00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:04.830
So yeah, that was pretty cool.

76
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.955
I've used databases over my entire career,
I've worked at Reddit, Netflix, LinkedIn,

77
00:04:09.955 --> 00:04:13.260
Microsoft, and some other smaller
companies here and there.

78
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.590
And I've used a variety of different
databases across all these

79
00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.460
different companies.

80
00:04:18.085 --> 00:04:21.956
My first job my very,
very first programming job,

81
00:04:21.956 --> 00:04:25.955
which was a little shop in Provo, Utah.

82
00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:31.535
I wrote primarily SQL that was like 95%
of my job was writing really long SQL.

83
00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:34.565
So this is something that
I've done a lot of actually.

84
00:04:35.715 --> 00:04:36.665
And then nothing else.

85
00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:39.160
I was a very early MongoDB user.

86
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.110
My very first event that I ever went to
for like programming was Mongo days SF.

87
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.036
Which that's got to be 2011 probably.

88
00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:51.835
What did I put in here?

89
00:04:51.835 --> 00:04:53.067
I think I looked it up.

90
00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:53.721
I don't remember.

91
00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:55.024
It was a long time ago, and

92
00:04:55.024 --> 00:04:58.340
it was back before people
thought MongoDB was a good idea.

93
00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.270
So, that should tell you
how long ago it was.

94
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.088
Now, I've now probably
been to like 150 events,

95
00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:05.910
it's just funny that was the first one.

96
00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.545
When I'm not at Microsoft or
on Frontend Masters, I try and

97
00:05:11.545 --> 00:05:13.140
get away from my keyboard.

98
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.525
You can come exercise with me on Peloton I
do a lot of Peloton actually did it this

99
00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.990
morning.

100
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.770
So I put my link on to
my profile on there.

101
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.156
I like Aila scotches, local beers,
medium roast coffees,

102
00:05:25.156 --> 00:05:29.490
traveling around the world and
this little, hazard.

103
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.360
[LAUGH] That's my dog,
her name's Luna, yeah.

104
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.150
And then getting my ass kicked at Dota and
Overwatch.

105
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.330
As most of the staff at
Frontend Masters can attest.

106
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.660
I'm pretty bad at both of those.

107
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.288
Cool.

108
00:05:44.288 --> 00:05:46.921
And lastly,
I just always put these in my courses,

109
00:05:46.921 --> 00:05:50.537
My favorite charities that I like
contributing to are AnnieCannons,

110
00:05:50.537 --> 00:05:54.170
The Last Mile, VetsWhoCode,
Legal Counsel for Youth and Children.

111
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.635
And as always, I always have
to thank Frontend Masters for

112
00:05:58.635 --> 00:06:01.810
giving me a platform and the opportunity
to speak to all of you today.

113
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.560
So thanks, Frontend Masters.

114
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.270
You guys are the best.

115
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.830
And I always dropped my social links
in there, Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub.

116
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.390
Feel free to come chat with me.

117
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.621
I will tell you that I'm terrible
at responding to private messages,

118
00:06:16.621 --> 00:06:20.410
especially LinkedIn because I get so
many I literally cannot read all of them.

119
00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.031
But, yeah, feel free to catch
up with me on the socials.

120
00:06:28.824 --> 00:06:31.590
All right, that's enough about me.

121
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.270
Let's stop talking about me,
let's start talking about databases.
