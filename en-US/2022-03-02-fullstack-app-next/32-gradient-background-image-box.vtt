WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.998
We had the data fetching from the custom
hooks that calls the playlist API

2
00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:10.304
function that we created so we can
populate the playlist list on the sidebar.

3
00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:15.800
So got all those things working in unison,
talking about the cookie that's saved

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.390
in the browser that's set up on a request
that is checked with our validate routes.

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.189
Higher order function
which gets a playlist.

6
00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.669
And yeah, all that just works and
then we're able to actually see this,

7
00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:30.881
the homepage and stuff.

8
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:35.026
Because of our middleware that allows
us to because we are signed in and

9
00:00:35.026 --> 00:00:37.638
then our forms are working,
so all is good.

10
00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:41.689
Now what we wanna do, just to get
some more things done is to work on

11
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:46.552
the homepage and actually get that going
so we can start work on the playlist and

12
00:00:46.552 --> 00:00:48.779
actually have some music playing.

13
00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:55.049
So what we'll do now is go over to our
notes where we have the designs and

14
00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.747
figure out what if we can
make some components here.

15
00:00:59.747 --> 00:01:02.459
So if we're looking at the homepage,

16
00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:06.550
it kind of looks very
similar to the playlist page.

17
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.394
So this is what a playlist
page looks like.

18
00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:11.375
It's got a list of songs,
homepage looks very similar.

19
00:01:11.375 --> 00:01:13.001
It just doesn't have a list of songs, but

20
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:16.030
it's got this gradient at the top with
this other little panel at the bottom.

21
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.740
So what I wanna do is just make a
component that is basically the layout for

22
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.456
this page, cuz we're gonna reuse
it on a playlist page as well.

23
00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:29.673
So we'll make that component and

24
00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:35.070
then we'll get the user using our use
me hook to populate the user here.

25
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.483
Maybe we'll run another
database migration, add a user,

26
00:01:38.483 --> 00:01:41.497
first name and last name so
that that'll look cool.

27
00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:44.607
I don't know if we had an avatar for the
users, we might run another migration for

28
00:01:44.607 --> 00:01:45.174
that as well.

29
00:01:45.174 --> 00:01:46.977
So we'll do that, that'd be really cool.

30
00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:49.659
I'll add an avatar and
then we'll put some artists down here,

31
00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.710
which I also don't think have avatars,
so we can add avatars for that.

32
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.171
So a lot of stuff happening here.

33
00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:58.787
But it's nothing new that we haven't done
already, so we'll just go back and do it.

34
00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:01.357
Let's do it.
So first things first is that components.

35
00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:06.280
So let's make this gradient page
component is what I'm gonna call it cuz

36
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.901
we're gonna reuse it.

37
00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:13.316
So let's head over to our code,
we'll make a new component here and

38
00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:17.312
I'm just gonna call it
gradients layouts.tsx.

39
00:02:17.312 --> 00:02:20.011
So we'll do that.

40
00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:25.331
And it's going to import

41
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:30.910
a box and a flex and a text.

42
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.749
We are gonna use text now from at chakra.

43
00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.967
I guess you could import all these
from layout or react, I don't know,

44
00:02:39.967 --> 00:02:41.314
I was gonna do layout.

45
00:02:41.314 --> 00:02:48.914
And we're gonna import, there is
an image component from @chakra/react,

46
00:02:48.914 --> 00:02:54.795
not to be confused with the image
component from next image.

47
00:02:54.795 --> 00:03:00.273
I know, it's all the same,
but this one's different.

48
00:03:00.273 --> 00:03:05.281
Their image components,
let's take a look at it, chakra UI.

49
00:03:05.281 --> 00:03:10.455
I'm using their image component because,
one,

50
00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:15.269
it's got Dan Abram off on it so
yeah, why not.

51
00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.296
But no, it's just a lot better for
what I think is like photos and

52
00:03:19.296 --> 00:03:23.475
avatars whereas like the image
component from next JS is better for

53
00:03:23.475 --> 00:03:26.404
optimizing art and everything's like that.

54
00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:29.660
So they both have their own benefits.

55
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.692
We're gonna use the image
component from chakra UI,

56
00:03:31.692 --> 00:03:34.760
because I think it's gonna
work better with the avatar.

57
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.930
So we will do that.

58
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.188
Yeah, so here we go.

59
00:03:39.188 --> 00:03:43.586
And then basically I'm just gonna
make a component gradient layout.

60
00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:49.424
And this component because it's a layout,
it's definitely gonna take some props.

61
00:03:49.424 --> 00:03:53.761
So we got to kind of think about how
do we make this thing flexible and

62
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:57.565
the way we can do that so
if we go back and look at the design.

63
00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:00.720
So yes, it's the same on both pages but
it's also different.

64
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.096
So let's look into, and
the way you know what options to take is,

65
00:04:05.096 --> 00:04:08.060
what's the different data on the screen?

66
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.961
So if we look at this,
we have two different image.

67
00:04:10.961 --> 00:04:15.475
So we probably had to take like an image
prop, we have two different titles here.

68
00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:16.970
So we're gonna take a title prop.

69
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.530
We have two different,
whatever you would call that, a subtitle.

70
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.316
So we'll take a prop for that.

71
00:04:23.316 --> 00:04:25.730
We have a difference.

72
00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.720
I don't know, description maybe.

73
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.779
So we'll take a prop for
that cuz it's different down here as well.

74
00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:34.215
And then we have what looks
like a different color,

75
00:04:34.215 --> 00:04:36.490
obviously this one's grey, this one's red.

76
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.257
So we'll take a prop for color,

77
00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:42.140
and then the whole page underneath
it is completely different.

78
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.176
As far as the content goes, so we'll
probably just use children for that, and

79
00:04:45.176 --> 00:04:48.166
that'll just be like, you can render
whatever the hell you want down there,

80
00:04:48.166 --> 00:04:49.410
doesn't matter.

81
00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.101
But we do wanna make sure that we do
the coloring and the gradients right.

82
00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:56.178
So those are all the different props we'll
take because that's the only thing that's

83
00:04:56.178 --> 00:04:57.709
different, everything else is the same.

84
00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:00.236
So, that's kind of how I think about URL.

85
00:05:00.236 --> 00:05:02.783
I'll look at the similarities and
like, okay, what data is different?

86
00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:06.910
Well, that all that different data needs
to be a prop, and that's how I do it.

87
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.570
So for the gradient layouts,
we're gonna do some of those props.

88
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.840
So I talked about the color,
so we'll have color here.

89
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.462
We talked about children rendering that
page on any, that was gonna be anything.

90
00:05:21.462 --> 00:05:24.416
We talked about the image so we'll do
that, we talked about the subtitle.

91
00:05:24.416 --> 00:05:28.968
So we'll have subtitle here, or
it's subtitles just one word,

92
00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:30.640
yeah, it's one word.

93
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.554
And then we have the title,
then we have the description.

94
00:05:36.554 --> 00:05:40.109
And then the other thing is that
this one's a round image and

95
00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:45.100
this one's not a round image, so I think
we'll have another prop for round image.

96
00:05:48.355 --> 00:05:50.340
So that way this thing is super flexible.

97
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.882
So those all the props that we'll take.

98
00:05:54.387 --> 00:05:56.749
And then we'll just return some JSX.

99
00:05:56.749 --> 00:06:00.430
So we'll turn a box here.

100
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.700
And this is gonna be a full page box.

101
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.055
So we'll just say height is 100vh and

102
00:06:08.055 --> 00:06:12.107
then that's pretty much
all we need to do there.

103
00:06:12.107 --> 00:06:16.697
And then for the overflow,
we'll put overflow y of auto, so

104
00:06:16.697 --> 00:06:20.150
it scrolls we want that to scroll.

105
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.990
And then next thing is like trying
to figure out the gradient.

106
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.040
So luckily for us, Chakra UI has a really
cool built in gradient mechanism here.

107
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.590
So we're gonna make a gradient here.

108
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.894
And we're gonna say we want
a linear gradients and

109
00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:40.444
we want it to be starting at whatever
color they pass in as a prop.

110
00:06:43.347 --> 00:06:48.215
So we want that color.500,
because remember what chakra

111
00:06:48.215 --> 00:06:52.440
we can do the colors.100
all the way up to 900.

112
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.593
So whatever color you pass me on,

113
00:06:53.593 --> 00:06:56.830
when I get the 500 value which is
somewhere in the middle of that color.

114
00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:02.095
And Chakra comes with gray, blue, green,
orange, yellow, pink, red, purple.

115
00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:06.733
So parsing one of those colors,
we'll start at the 500 variation of that,

116
00:07:06.733 --> 00:07:08.503
which is right in the middle.

117
00:07:08.503 --> 00:07:15.280
And we'll say do that at 0%,
so start with that.

118
00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.675
And then the next step in
the gradient will be the same color,

119
00:07:18.675 --> 00:07:23.148
and we'll probably bump it up to be
a little darker which will be like .600.

120
00:07:23.148 --> 00:07:30.370
And we'll do a,
somewhere around 15% of that somewhere.

121
00:07:32.627 --> 00:07:35.330
And let me see,
that sort of fixes it, there we go.

122
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.970
And then the next one will be
basically the same color again.

123
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:44.624
But even darker, so 700 version of that,
and that'll go to 40%.

124
00:07:46.467 --> 00:07:51.261
And then from there, if you go look at the
design, it kind of just fades to black or

125
00:07:51.261 --> 00:07:53.950
to almost black, not quite black.

126
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.551
So for that one,
I'll say I'll use RGBA here, and

127
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.658
I'll do black which is 0000.

128
00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:07.876
But for transparency of almost there,
but not quite 0.95,

129
00:08:07.876 --> 00:08:15.340
and I'll make that come up to 75% So
that'll be our background gradient.

130
00:08:19.779 --> 00:08:25.587
So whatever color at 500 is 0%,
then 15% down through the whole page,

131
00:08:25.587 --> 00:08:29.723
start this next color,
at 40% down to the homepage,

132
00:08:29.723 --> 00:08:34.135
start this next color, and
then at 75% down on the page.

133
00:08:34.135 --> 00:08:37.468
So only a quarter left to
start this almost black color.

134
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.664
So, hopefully that'll look
good if not we'll fix it.

135
00:08:43.664 --> 00:08:49.092
And then instead inside this box, I think
what we'll do is probably just do a flex.

136
00:08:49.092 --> 00:08:52.220
Cuz if we go back here,
we got one thing on the left, and

137
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.740
it's one thing here on the right, so
we'll just flex, we'll flex that.

138
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.130
So we'll do a flex here.

139
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:02.431
And then for
this flex we'll give this a background

140
00:09:02.431 --> 00:09:07.130
color of the same color
that they passed in.

141
00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:13.200
But for 600, so we'll say color.600.

142
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.690
And that's gonna give us this
darker switch right here.

143
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.059
So if you go look at the red,
its goes bright red, bright red and boom,

144
00:09:21.059 --> 00:09:22.879
it kind of just goes dark a little bit.

145
00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:26.039
That's what's gonna do that,
it's gonna give us that right there.

146
00:09:27.408 --> 00:09:31.611
So we got our flex 600 there, and
then we'll add some padding to this.

147
00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:35.177
You can play around with this number,
I'm just gonna do 40 pixels.

148
00:09:35.177 --> 00:09:40.333
And then I'm going to align at the end.

149
00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:46.135
And the reason I'm aligning at the end is,
if you go look at the design,

150
00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:50.119
is this text right here is at the bottom,
right?

151
00:09:50.119 --> 00:09:53.272
If I didn't align at the end, it'll
actually be at the top, it'll be up here.

152
00:09:53.272 --> 00:09:55.690
If I align at the end,
it'll push it down here.

153
00:09:55.690 --> 00:10:00.530
So align is vertical, justifies x.

154
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.610
So if I align at the end,
it'll put the text at the bottom, if not,

155
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.607
it'll be at the top.

156
00:10:04.607 --> 00:10:06.403
So that's why I'm doing that.

157
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.713
Go back to our code.

158
00:10:09.713 --> 00:10:13.382
So we got the flex there.

159
00:10:13.382 --> 00:10:17.177
And then I was gonna put a word here so
we can actually render this thing out and

160
00:10:17.177 --> 00:10:21.870
see what it looks like, then we can kind
of build it while we're looking at it.

161
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:29.410
So we have that, and then I'm just
going to put that there like that.

162
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.818
Hello, so we got our gradient layout.

163
00:10:31.818 --> 00:10:36.700
So now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
go to our index.tsx inside the pages.

164
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.340
And we're gonna use the gradient
layout in here, right?

165
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.304
So I can get rid of this div.

166
00:10:44.304 --> 00:10:47.352
I don't know why I just did that.

167
00:10:47.352 --> 00:10:49.324
So we got our gradient layouts here.

168
00:10:53.636 --> 00:10:58.152
I'm gonna give it a color of red and
then I'll just say,

169
00:11:01.937 --> 00:11:07.060
I'll just put a div for now,
homepage, something like that.

170
00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:10.879
And this thing's freaking out because
obviously I didn't parse in all the other

171
00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.788
stuff, so hopefully it still renders,

172
00:11:12.788 --> 00:11:16.738
hopefully typescript just allows us to
render it without it fulfilling the props.

173
00:11:16.738 --> 00:11:20.708
If not, we'll fill it out and we'll do it,
but I just wanna see on the page,

174
00:11:20.708 --> 00:11:22.460
right click, so let me run this.

175
00:11:29.704 --> 00:11:34.255
There we go, so
we got a nice little gradient,

176
00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:39.060
layout looking thing here,
looks pretty cool.

177
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.938
The one thing to notice though is
that the homepage is coming over

178
00:11:41.938 --> 00:11:43.065
the player bar, right?

179
00:11:43.065 --> 00:11:47.185
We don't want that, we want it to stop,
so we got to fix that.

180
00:11:47.185 --> 00:11:52.001
And the way that we can do that is
pretty much the same way we did it for

181
00:11:52.001 --> 00:11:55.617
the sidebar which should
be in the player layout.

182
00:11:55.617 --> 00:11:57.631
So if we look at the player layout.

183
00:12:00.244 --> 00:12:04.559
So we're counting for
the margin left for 200 pixels, but for

184
00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:07.320
what we do with the sidebar here, right?

185
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:11.286
So for the sidebar,
where are we doing that?

186
00:12:11.286 --> 00:12:13.945
And then we're doing that somewhere,
there we go, Calc, here we go.

187
00:12:13.945 --> 00:12:18.937
So see how we're calculating
the height here to be 100vh-

188
00:12:18.937 --> 00:12:24.506
the height of the bottom bar for
100 pixels will do the same thing.

189
00:12:24.506 --> 00:12:26.522
And there's many places we can do it,

190
00:12:26.522 --> 00:12:30.182
we could just do it here in the gradient
layout if we wanted to I guess.

191
00:12:30.182 --> 00:12:32.496
But then we had to do it somewhere else,

192
00:12:32.496 --> 00:12:35.734
it's probably better just
to do it somewhere in here.

193
00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:38.222
We might even just take this and

194
00:12:38.222 --> 00:12:42.439
wrap it in another box like so
and then add children.

195
00:12:42.439 --> 00:12:49.053
And then here we can say,
height is 100vh or

196
00:12:49.053 --> 00:12:53.812
calc 100vh- 100 pixels.

197
00:12:57.945 --> 00:13:02.367
Okay, and well we didn't again I guess
that was that wouldn't matter because I

198
00:13:02.367 --> 00:13:04.683
just made the gradient layout 100 VH.

199
00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:09.591
So I guess that wouldn't matter, so
I would have to actually put that back and

200
00:13:09.591 --> 00:13:12.324
then make gradient layout like 100%.

201
00:13:15.755 --> 00:13:18.104
I think that might work,
there we go, yeah.

202
00:13:20.193 --> 00:13:21.373
There's a lot of ways you
could have done that.

203
00:13:21.373 --> 00:13:24.563
We could also just put that calc
right here in the gradient layout.

204
00:13:24.563 --> 00:13:27.699
But then again, if we had a different
layout for a different page,

205
00:13:27.699 --> 00:13:29.721
we don't have to do it somewhere else too.

206
00:13:29.721 --> 00:13:34.705
So in the player layout, I just did
the calc here, 100vh- 100 pixels.

207
00:13:34.705 --> 00:13:38.302
Then wrap the child in that,
and then integrating layouts,

208
00:13:38.302 --> 00:13:42.334
I just made the height 100% of
whatever that is which will be here

209
00:13:51.219 --> 00:13:54.399
Okay, and
just to make sure that the color works,

210
00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:59.395
we can go back to the index page and I can
put in another color like blue and here,

211
00:13:59.395 --> 00:14:02.998
gradient should work the same
no matter what I paste in.

212
00:14:12.395 --> 00:14:15.616
Okay, back to the gradient now,

213
00:14:15.616 --> 00:14:20.224
we'll actually start
making staff look cool.

214
00:14:20.224 --> 00:14:24.596
So we got that, the next thing we're gonna
do here is make a box for the image,

215
00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.425
big image there on the profile.

216
00:14:26.425 --> 00:14:31.295
So we'll say box, and then we'll use that

217
00:14:31.295 --> 00:14:35.903
image tag that we imported from chakra.

218
00:14:35.903 --> 00:14:38.300
Actually, let's put some
padding on this box I guess.

219
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:41.120
Always add some padding,
that'll be 20 pixels.

220
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:45.065
And then for this image,
it's going to take a box size.

221
00:14:45.065 --> 00:14:47.821
So how big you want this to be.

222
00:14:47.821 --> 00:14:48.758
You can play around with this.

223
00:14:48.758 --> 00:14:51.640
I think I found 160 works pretty good,
it's big enough.

224
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:58.558
And then you can add a box shadow and
there's different sizes for that.

225
00:14:58.558 --> 00:15:01.853
I went really crazy to 2xl,
so I did 2xl there.

226
00:15:01.853 --> 00:15:05.124
You could check out the API for Chakra to
see the different values you can put there

227
00:15:05.124 --> 00:15:07.359
or you can just hover over boxShow and
it'll tell you.

228
00:15:07.359 --> 00:15:11.716
So you can see, could you the base
outline small, medium large xl to xls, so

229
00:15:11.716 --> 00:15:15.680
I put 2xl, the biggest shadow,
we'll see if it looks tacky or not.

230
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.372
Usually big shadows look tacky, but

231
00:15:17.372 --> 00:15:19.454
I think it looked pretty
good on this design.

232
00:15:19.454 --> 00:15:21.862
And then for the source,
we'll actually just put an image.

233
00:15:21.862 --> 00:15:26.756
So whatever that is, and then border
radius this is where the rounding comes

234
00:15:26.756 --> 00:15:28.908
in so, is there a border radius?

235
00:15:28.908 --> 00:15:33.118
Well, it depends, is it a,
what did I call the prop?

236
00:15:33.118 --> 00:15:37.290
Round image, so round image,
that's true, or not.

237
00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:43.555
So if that is true then we will do a
border radius of 100%, so fully circular.

238
00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:47.887
If not, we'll just give some rounded
edges which will be like three pixels.

239
00:15:47.887 --> 00:15:49.215
So that'll give us an image.

240
00:15:51.623 --> 00:15:55.052
If we want, we can test this, we can
just go get an image and put it here and

241
00:15:55.052 --> 00:15:56.085
you can check it out.

242
00:15:56.085 --> 00:15:57.471
But this is good enough,

243
00:15:57.471 --> 00:16:00.975
this little board I think kind of
show you the image looks like.

244
00:16:00.975 --> 00:16:05.792
And then if I wanted to make it round and
go back here, right,

245
00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:07.971
I could say, round image.

246
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:11.660
And just like that, just put round image,
and then now it's round.
