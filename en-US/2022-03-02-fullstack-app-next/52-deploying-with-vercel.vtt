WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.320
And now let's just take a look at our app.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.397
Let's observe it.

3
00:00:02.397 --> 00:00:05.755
So so far we got our playlist in here.

4
00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:09.150
You can switch playlists,
you can play an entire playlist.

5
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.673
You can pause, you can skip a song,
you can go back, you can shuffle,

6
00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:15.410
you can repeat.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.220
All the tracking seems to be working.

8
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.034
You can click and seek,
you can drag and seek.

9
00:00:20.034 --> 00:00:22.210
You got a really nice music player here.

10
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.750
And actually the songs aren't that bad.

11
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.690
I hand picked those songs.

12
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.860
So if you need some beats, some free
beats to listen to, check those out.

13
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.245
So yeah, so far,
this is a great music player.

14
00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:33.199
Like I said at the beginning,

15
00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.195
we're not gonna build all
the features in this music player.

16
00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:37.455
There's so
many other things that we could make.

17
00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.709
I mean, just even adding avatars and
albums, and

18
00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:42.030
art like that would make this thing pop.

19
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.797
The volume control's on the rights,
and using the Spotify or

20
00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:50.516
any other casting API to casts the
different devices, which is really cool.

21
00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.260
There's a Chromecast JS plugin.

22
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.349
There's so many things you can do here.

23
00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:57.015
And then having the ability
to create a playlist and

24
00:00:57.015 --> 00:00:59.253
add a favorite will be
really cool as well.

25
00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:05.370
And you can really make this thing pop,
and then just making it responsive.

26
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.000
So it looks better and stuff like that.

27
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.254
But I think the foundation is here if you
wanna continue building on some more of

28
00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:14.460
those features,
just based off the design alone.

29
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.817
So that was kind of the goal.

30
00:01:15.817 --> 00:01:19.766
Initially, it was just like, how do I
make it to where if people wanted to use

31
00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:23.313
this as practice to sharpen their
skills with these technologies.

32
00:01:23.313 --> 00:01:26.386
Cuz there's always like, well, what do
I do after I take all these courses?

33
00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:29.050
Well, you can add more features
to this thing if you want to.

34
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.810
So feel free to do that and
get more practice in.

35
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.430
I think it'd be really cool.

36
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.909
What I'm gonna do now is
actually deploy this thing so

37
00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.000
you can show it off and just kind of
walk through how that's gonna look.

38
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.690
Now since we're using Next.js,
which is built by a company called Vercel,

39
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.450
which just happens to
be a hosting provider.

40
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.940
We have really good support for
deploying this thing.

41
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.773
There's so many ways you can do it.

42
00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:54.399
They have a CLI that's really cool.

43
00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.160
I don't want everyone
fumbling through a CLI.

44
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.570
So we're just gonna go to the website and
we're gonna do it there.

45
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.490
But I do recommend at least pushing
your stuff up to a GitHub repo.

46
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.621
It makes it so much easier when you
go to Vercel to just deploy this

47
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:12.330
repo versus having to go through a CLI or
do some other mechanism.

48
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.445
So if you haven't pushed us up to your
repo, I recommend doing that on GitHub.

49
00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:17.784
Hopefully everyone has a GitHub.

50
00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:20.806
I know I didn't say that that
was a requirements, but yeah,

51
00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.601
if you don't have a GitHub,
you can still deploy this.

52
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.449
It would just be through a CLI and
their documentation is pretty effective.

53
00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.048
I'll show you how to do that.

54
00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.778
We're gonna do it through the GUI.

55
00:02:31.778 --> 00:02:35.852
So first thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna update my main branch.

56
00:02:35.852 --> 00:02:38.730
So I'm gonna go to GitHub, and

57
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.060
I'm gonna make my main branch the current,
which is 7.

58
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.260
So I'm gonna merge this in to main,

59
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.452
create that pull requests, merge that in.

60
00:02:55.362 --> 00:02:57.487
Cool, no, I don't mean to delete it.

61
00:02:57.487 --> 00:02:59.460
I'll add that back.

62
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.540
There we go.

63
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.466
Okay, so now my main branch is updated.

64
00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:05.500
It's got the latest, should be good to go.

65
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.147
The next thing I need to do is, well,

66
00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:10.760
there is actually a lot of things we need
to do, but let's just get it deployed and

67
00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.176
we can walk back our scenario
to see what makes sense.

68
00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:15.197
Cuz there's things we should do,
things we have to do,

69
00:03:15.197 --> 00:03:17.700
things that don't really matter right now.

70
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.117
So first thing is let's
head over to Vercel, and

71
00:03:22.117 --> 00:03:25.262
you can just type in vercel.com.

72
00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:28.180
You have to make an account there.

73
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.600
It's free, you don't need a credit card.

74
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.076
You can sign in with GitHub,
Google, GitLab, I think.

75
00:03:34.076 --> 00:03:36.474
I guess it works with GitLab too,
if you don't have GitHub.

76
00:03:36.474 --> 00:03:38.119
Just go to create a new projects.

77
00:03:41.628 --> 00:03:44.484
And this is where if you
did log in with GitHub,

78
00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:47.700
you'll see a lot of your repos show up.

79
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.799
So for me,
here's the last repos I've worked on.

80
00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.220
I don't know how they get this order.

81
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.860
This one was 73 days ago,
but it's still here.

82
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.666
There's also templates.

83
00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:02.336
So we could have went the other way
from the beginning of this course,

84
00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:06.470
we could have just went here and
deploy to Hello Next.js app.

85
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.104
And they will put that on GitHub for us.

86
00:04:08.104 --> 00:04:11.210
And then we were started working from
there and we had to deploy from day one.

87
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.566
Sometimes I do do that,
I just deploy immediately and

88
00:04:14.566 --> 00:04:17.408
then just continue to
deploy as I go forward.

89
00:04:17.408 --> 00:04:19.546
And that was my original plan, but

90
00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:24.192
I thought that that was gonna slow the
pace down of having to check that every

91
00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:29.238
single time after I had some of my friends
go through and work on this curriculum.

92
00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.970
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
select the Import for my app,

93
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.480
which is called Full Stack music.

94
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.838
Your repo might have a different name,
whatever you call it on GitHub or GitLab,

95
00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:40.619
this is mine.

96
00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:43.612
I'm gonna import it,
give whatever name you want.

97
00:04:43.612 --> 00:04:49.911
The root directory is gonna be root,
because that that's how Next.js app works.

98
00:04:51.914 --> 00:04:55.503
Built and output settings,

99
00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:59.995
I would say we do wanna change this.

100
00:04:59.995 --> 00:05:01.359
Definitely some things
we wanna change here.

101
00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:05.369
So I think what we wanna do here
is I'm just running next build.

102
00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:10.569
I think we wanna run Prisma.

103
00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.890
Do we have to install Prisma?

104
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.896
You might have to install Prisma.

105
00:05:14.896 --> 00:05:16.356
I'm just gonna put npx in front of it.

106
00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:21.230
So I will say npx prisma generate.

107
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.985
So it generates the SDK.

108
00:05:24.985 --> 00:05:27.797
Without it, our app could literally break.

109
00:05:27.797 --> 00:05:31.607
If it doesn't generate this,
then when you go do prisma.user,

110
00:05:31.607 --> 00:05:35.090
.user is not gonna exist, so
it'll break in production.

111
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:40.271
So you have to do this prisma generate,
and then npx,

112
00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:46.684
Prisma migrate deploy.

113
00:05:48.693 --> 00:05:53.448
And then next build,
so it'll be all those.

114
00:05:53.448 --> 00:05:56.940
And I guess I need to spell Prisma,
otherwise, that will totally break.

115
00:05:58.794 --> 00:06:00.289
Yeah, I think npx works here.

116
00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.163
If not, we'll fix it and then we'll
just install Prisma globally here and

117
00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:04.040
we'll do it that way.

118
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.280
But so, yeah, prisma generate, prisma
migrate deploy, and then do a next build.

119
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.470
So we'll do that.

120
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.835
You can keep all of these the same.

121
00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:15.346
It already knows Next.js,
it already does npm.

122
00:06:15.346 --> 00:06:18.409
And then environment variables, I mean,
you really just wanna do the same thing

123
00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:20.710
you did in your environment
variables file locally.

124
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:22.880
So I'm just gonna go
get my local variables.

125
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.467
Obviously, typically you would
have a different database for

126
00:06:25.467 --> 00:06:27.772
production than you would
at development and staging.

127
00:06:27.772 --> 00:06:30.412
But I'm not gonna walk you through making
a whole another database just to add these

128
00:06:30.412 --> 00:06:31.250
environment variables.

129
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.129
You can just use the same environment
variables that you use locally if it was

130
00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:36.105
a local database.

131
00:06:36.105 --> 00:06:40.640
If you're using a local Postgres database,
this is where you would have to go make

132
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.416
a database on Heroku or
somewhere and go get a URL.

133
00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:48.112
So if you did run your Postgres database
locally, you gotta go make a database for

134
00:06:48.112 --> 00:06:52.740
this step to deploy, cuz you can't
use your local database deployment.

135
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.030
So I'm gonna take database URL here.

136
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:02.460
I'm gonna paste that in, I'm gonna grab
the value like that, paste that in there.

137
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.273
And there we go,
I'm gonna add the other one.

138
00:07:06.273 --> 00:07:09.490
I don't think it needs it in production,
but I'm gonna grab it anyway.

139
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.218
If it doesn't use it,
then it doesn't use it.

140
00:07:14.575 --> 00:07:16.697
I'm gonna add that.

141
00:07:16.697 --> 00:07:19.915
Cool, we got both of our
environment variables.

142
00:07:19.915 --> 00:07:25.290
I wanna say Node env is gonna
set to be production by default.

143
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.990
But I guess technically we
could just set that here too.

144
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.570
This is also where we will put like our
JWT secret that we hard coded everywhere.

145
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.260
We will also put our cookie name
that we hard coded everywhere.

146
00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.070
We'll put all that here,
but we just hard coded it.

147
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.440
So we definitely put that here,
that shouldn't break the app.

148
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.951
That's just for security.

149
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:44.130
You should just put that here for
security.

150
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.669
But it shouldn't affect
how the app behaves,

151
00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:49.477
where this would definitely
affect how the API is.

152
00:07:51.254 --> 00:07:54.721
Okay, so once we got all that set,
we can attempt to do a deploy,

153
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:56.630
we're gonna see what happens.

154
00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:58.340
So let's do that.

155
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.998
I think the thing we might have to do is

156
00:08:01.998 --> 00:08:06.492
globally set our Prisma
client to be global.

157
00:08:06.492 --> 00:08:10.090
It really depends on how their
serverless functions behave, we'll see.

158
00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:12.540
So now it's building,
we can look at the output of it.

159
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.225
It's basically gonna do exactly
what you would do locally,

160
00:08:15.225 --> 00:08:16.760
plus the commands that we gave it.

161
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.479
And I don't know exactly
the provider that Vercel uses.

162
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:26.651
Like I said, it's like a mix of custom,
plus Azure and

163
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:30.668
Google maybe,
maybe you need some AWS, I'm sure.

164
00:08:30.668 --> 00:08:32.451
There's something going on there.

165
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:36.910
But, yeah, and
then we got a TypeScript error.

166
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.000
There we go.

167
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.687
So, well,
at least we got past the hard part.

168
00:08:40.687 --> 00:08:43.532
[LAUGH] You got past the stuff
that could have broken,

169
00:08:43.532 --> 00:08:45.610
now we're just stuck on TypeScript.

170
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.400
So it doesn't like this one.

171
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.800
It's like,
you can't be the same as your man.

172
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.360
So, all right,
I guess I'll fix that one, if I must.

173
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.250
So for that deployment, it just wants
me to go down here and say, and

174
00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.724
now you could just do something like this.

175
00:09:02.724 --> 00:09:07.807
You can say as number, Do that,

176
00:09:07.807 --> 00:09:12.644
or you can do that in JSX maybe, type
string of type number may be mistaken.

177
00:09:12.644 --> 00:09:17.708
Now so you can do as unknown,

178
00:09:17.708 --> 00:09:20.877
[LAUGH] as number.

179
00:09:20.877 --> 00:09:21.736
There we go.

180
00:09:24.174 --> 00:09:29.623
[LAUGH] Yeah, so that's the fix for that.

181
00:09:29.623 --> 00:09:30.790
Don't ask me how I know that.

182
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.673
Clearly been doing that for a while.

183
00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:36.605
And then this was just a ES linting,
so it should be good.

184
00:09:36.605 --> 00:09:38.769
It's not gonna break TypeScript.

185
00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:39.446
We got that.

186
00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:40.299
I'm gonna push this up.

187
00:09:40.299 --> 00:09:42.207
And now because I did
set that up at Vercel,

188
00:09:42.207 --> 00:09:44.740
it should automatically deploy
every time I do a push.

189
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:49.040
So because I just pushed that up,
can refresh this and here it is.

190
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.140
Okay, so it looks like it's building
right now, so let's check it out.

191
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.524
We can go to deployments,
you can see it's building.

192
00:09:58.524 --> 00:10:00.167
It looks like it failed, again,

193
00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:04.170
before this probably cuz that typo that
I pushed up, let's see what it says now.

194
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.551
Don't fail me now.

195
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:07.943
Okay, we got another type error here.

196
00:10:11.998 --> 00:10:13.290
How can I just turn off type checking?

197
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:14.318
I just wanna turn it off.

198
00:10:14.318 --> 00:10:16.076
Let's do that.

199
00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:21.510
Yeah, yes, that's the one.

200
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.620
They knew we needed this.

201
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.220
This is in the next config.

202
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:30.171
Awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome,
awesome, yes, restrict mode.

203
00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:37.340
Thank you.

204
00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:39.190
Okay, cool, let's try this again.

205
00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.930
Go to our dashboard.

206
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:47.060
It's building, look at these deployments.

207
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.600
Watch it again, and
let's see what happens.

208
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:54.228
So, yeah,
this is why you deploy early, and

209
00:10:54.228 --> 00:10:58.155
then you set up a CI so
you can catch it every time.

210
00:10:58.155 --> 00:11:01.016
This is also why people love TypeScript.

211
00:11:01.016 --> 00:11:03.779
But the people who aren't
good at TypeScript,

212
00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:05.789
hate TypeScript because of this.

213
00:11:07.393 --> 00:11:11.543
No, have an error again, what's this?

214
00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:13.500
Skipping validations of type.

215
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.848
It's also now filling on ESLint.

216
00:11:15.848 --> 00:11:17.189
Okay, looks like that's the thing.

217
00:11:17.189 --> 00:11:19.249
There you go, they have that too.

218
00:11:19.249 --> 00:11:21.703
[LAUGH] they knew it was gonna happen.

219
00:11:21.703 --> 00:11:22.705
Let's do that.

220
00:11:22.705 --> 00:11:23.919
Let's try it again.

221
00:11:27.234 --> 00:11:28.996
Yeah, okay.

222
00:11:28.996 --> 00:11:29.958
We'll build it once more.

223
00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:31.105
We're getting closer.

224
00:11:33.386 --> 00:11:34.811
Deployments, here we go.

225
00:11:34.811 --> 00:11:35.728
It's running again.

226
00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:38.580
At least it deploys really quick, and
that took less than five seconds.

227
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.900
All right, so it's going through,
it's checking the package Json.

228
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:50.490
They'll do caching on the npm module,
so install is faster.

229
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.985
Yeah, it'll do that, it's pretty smart.

230
00:11:53.985 --> 00:11:55.679
Uploading the build outputs.

231
00:11:55.679 --> 00:12:00.380
So each one of these will tell you
the type of file that got generated.

232
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:05.481
So if you see an F, that means

233
00:12:05.481 --> 00:12:11.229
it is a function like, what is?

234
00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:13.077
The edge function.

235
00:12:13.077 --> 00:12:16.290
These are API functions.

236
00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.066
The circles are basically like pages.

237
00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:26.530
Okay, build completed.

238
00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:31.296
It look like we got a check and you can
even see it showing a preview of the page.

239
00:12:31.296 --> 00:12:32.187
That's a good sign.

240
00:12:32.187 --> 00:12:33.863
So we got a preview of the page.

241
00:12:33.863 --> 00:12:37.679
So we can go in here, and
there we go, I'm on my URL.

242
00:12:37.679 --> 00:12:38.820
It's asking me to sign in.

243
00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:42.100
Let's just check to make sure
the auth works if I try to go home.

244
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.480
Nope, it immediately
brings me back to sign in.

245
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.015
So the auth works pretty good.

246
00:12:47.015 --> 00:12:49.670
I'm using the same database,
so maybe the same user works.

247
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:54.054
User@test.com, password is password.

248
00:12:57.758 --> 00:13:00.170
Let's see what happens.

249
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.150
Sign in works.

250
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:03.470
We're able to sign in.

251
00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:06.076
It's pulling down my playlists data,
that looks good.

252
00:13:06.076 --> 00:13:07.890
It's using my seeded user.

253
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:09.993
We got our artists with our cats.

254
00:13:09.993 --> 00:13:13.329
If I go to my playlists,
playlists seems to be working just fine.

255
00:13:13.329 --> 00:13:19.662
If I click Play, it is currently playing.

256
00:13:19.662 --> 00:13:22.104
So we are deployed.

257
00:13:22.104 --> 00:13:26.731
So once you get past all the task errors
and things, it works pretty easily.

258
00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:28.016
And now it's hooked up to my GitHub.

259
00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:32.942
So every time I push to GitHub,
it's gonna do a deploy if you want.

260
00:13:32.942 --> 00:13:39.040
Next, Vercel also does what's
called preview builds.

261
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.820
So every pull request will get deployed.

262
00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.761
So if you're reviewing someone's code,
you can click on the link,

263
00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:46.699
it'll post the link in
GitHub pull request.

264
00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:49.548
I click this link to go see this
pull requests being deployed.

265
00:13:49.548 --> 00:13:53.890
You can go test that person's code out on
a preview build, which is really cool.

266
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.862
So you can do that,
it'll do that all the time.

267
00:13:56.862 --> 00:13:58.390
And yeah, it's pretty awesome.

268
00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:02.141
And then as far as the custom domains,
there's a lot of ways you can do that but

269
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.410
luckily for
us Vercel makes that pretty easy.

270
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:08.106
They have a Domains tab up here,
you can click on Domain.

271
00:14:08.106 --> 00:14:11.810
I have a domain here, I literally
don't even remember buying this.

272
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:14.113
I think I was gonna do some
ecommerce at one point.

273
00:14:14.113 --> 00:14:17.617
And I'll pop biabrand.shop, I don't know.

274
00:14:17.617 --> 00:14:20.325
I actually have a lot
of domains in another.

275
00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:22.903
I have so many domains there.

276
00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:26.460
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But it's actually quite easy,

277
00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.372
all you have to do is just buy a domain,
or

278
00:14:29.372 --> 00:14:34.090
if you have a domain you can
transfer it in if you want to.

279
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.022
And you can add in the domain and
authorization code here.

280
00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:42.499
You can add one,
select a project to add your domain to.

281
00:14:42.499 --> 00:14:44.475
There's a lot of ways to do it.

282
00:14:44.475 --> 00:14:46.333
I'm trying to see if I
can just use this one.

283
00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:48.460
I don't know if this one's being used or
not.

284
00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.432
I think I might be using this
on a different name server.

285
00:14:51.432 --> 00:14:55.737
The other way you can do it is that you
can actually just go to something like

286
00:14:55.737 --> 00:14:57.966
Cloudflare and set up a DNS yourself.

287
00:14:57.966 --> 00:15:00.316
You just gotta get the value
of the name server here.

288
00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:05.036
And then you can add that to your DNS and
Cloudflare or wherever you're

289
00:15:05.036 --> 00:15:09.844
doing your deal DNS, and then you
can manually route the domain there.

290
00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:12.580
Honestly, there really isn't much tutorial
to adding the domain if you do it

291
00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.218
through Vercel.

292
00:15:13.218 --> 00:15:16.617
You just literally buy it and then you
click Add, and you click on your project,

293
00:15:16.617 --> 00:15:17.653
and then you're done.

294
00:15:17.653 --> 00:15:20.376
That's it, you don't do anything else,
that's all you do.

295
00:15:20.376 --> 00:15:24.586
It handles the routing of the DNS,
obviously it'll take up to an hour for

296
00:15:24.586 --> 00:15:25.630
it to propagate.

297
00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:26.700
But that's it.

298
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.531
That's all you do for
a custom domain on Vercel.

299
00:15:28.531 --> 00:15:29.826
You don't do anything else.

300
00:15:29.826 --> 00:15:35.076
That's the easiest domain
situation I've ever seen.

301
00:15:35.076 --> 00:15:37.751
The other way, like I said,

302
00:15:37.751 --> 00:15:42.889
is to go buy a domain on Iwantmyname or
Google domains.

303
00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:46.312
You can go here,
this is where I buy all my domains.

304
00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:49.129
And you can find a domain here,
and you buy it, and

305
00:15:49.129 --> 00:15:52.910
then you just transfer it over to
the DNS by using the name servers.

306
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:56.402
I typically use Cloudflare for
that cuz it's so awesome.

307
00:15:56.402 --> 00:15:59.820
But yeah, for Vercel, you just click Buy
and then you add it and then you're done.

308
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.680
Or if you already have one,
transfer it in, and you're good to go.
