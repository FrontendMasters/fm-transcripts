1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.073
&gt;&gt; All right, the next thing is
is let's look at our design,

2
00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:03.710
see if we can kinda figure out this model.

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.011
I think there's a name for this,
I said like Domain Driven Development or

4
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.030
something like that.

5
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.858
But I look at the design, and I figure out
what the data model I need based on what

6
00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:14.010
information is on the screen.

7
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.016
And that kinda gives you the obvious data,
and then there's this secondary data,

8
00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:23.878
things that don't show up on the screen
that you need for querying purposes or for

9
00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:28.269
information purposes, analytics purposes,
that stuff comes later.

10
00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.147
But just by looking at this screen,
you can kinda guess what are some of

11
00:00:32.147 --> 00:00:36.113
the entities and some of the fields
of those entities that we'll need.

12
00:00:36.113 --> 00:00:39.765
So we already talked about a user, you
can see right now our user needs a name.

13
00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:43.006
I don't have a name field for our user,
I have email and I have password, but

14
00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:44.750
how am I gonna put the name here then.

15
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.426
So I can tell you right now that we
gotta add a name for the user, so

16
00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:50.944
we can save that somewhere, maybe a first
name, last name, or maybe just the name,

17
00:00:50.944 --> 00:00:52.300
but we got to add that.

18
00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.887
Looking at this design here,

19
00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:58.900
what are some other entities that you
could think of that we would need to make?

20
00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.990
&gt;&gt; Artist?

21
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.773
&gt;&gt; Artist, yeah, we need to make artist.

22
00:01:01.773 --> 00:01:02.419
What else?

23
00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:03.183
&gt;&gt; Playlist?

24
00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:04.368
&gt;&gt; Playlist, yep.

25
00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:07.150
Anything else?

26
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.856
&gt;&gt; CD's.

27
00:01:08.856 --> 00:01:11.413
&gt;&gt; Albums.

28
00:01:11.413 --> 00:01:12.195
&gt;&gt; Album.

29
00:01:12.195 --> 00:01:13.389
&gt;&gt; Albums, yep.

30
00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:15.703
&gt;&gt; Song.

31
00:01:15.703 --> 00:01:16.384
&gt;&gt; And a song.

32
00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:17.985
Yeah, absolutely.

33
00:01:17.985 --> 00:01:22.536
I would say those are the four
minimum ones that we need.

34
00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:26.481
You could probably get into more detail
about other different things, but yeah,

35
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:30.562
at minimum, I think we need those four
things, song, playlist, album, artist.

36
00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:31.799
I think yeah, we kinda need those.

37
00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.454
So let's do that and
we'll figure it out from there.

38
00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:38.150
Okay, let's start with the song.

39
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.757
So we'll say model Song.

40
00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:45.390
I'm just gonna copy these three cuz
everyone's gonna have these three.

41
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.038
They're all gonna have an ID and
a created at and updated at, and

42
00:01:50.038 --> 00:01:53.410
then a song has a name
that is gonna be a string.

43
00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.368
It's not gonna be unique because, I guess,
I mean I've heard songs with the same

44
00:01:59.368 --> 00:02:02.020
names before, so
that would just not be fair.

45
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.772
I guess you could get crazy and have it to
where a song plus an artist combination

46
00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:10.091
is unique, but
then artists might have the same song.

47
00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:14.164
Or maybe you can get to a song plus
an artist plus an album has a unique name,

48
00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:18.659
but you're just getting crazy at that
point, just let them have the same names.

49
00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.285
[LAUGH] It's okay.

50
00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:23.244
I mean how many times you run into that
when you're searching for music and

51
00:02:23.244 --> 00:02:26.249
you type in a name of a song and you
think it's the song but it's a completely

52
00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:30.310
different song and you're like,
that song was a cover of this other song.

53
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.720
That's when you realize that's
not an original song anymore.

54
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.660
That's happened to me so many times.

55
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.220
I think everything else on
the song is gonna be relations.

56
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.971
Let's start building
some of those relations.

57
00:02:38.971 --> 00:02:44.111
So the first one is gonna be an artist
cuz the song belongs to an artist,

58
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:45.518
so we'll do that.

59
00:02:45.518 --> 00:02:48.816
And again it's gonna
have all three of these.

60
00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:52.063
And then, so
song can belong to one artist and

61
00:02:52.063 --> 00:02:57.610
an artist can have many songs, so
it's a one to many relationship.

62
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.652
So the way that we wanna do that
is we can come down here and

63
00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:06.960
we can add it on either side and then
Prismo will try to complete it for us.

64
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.270
So that's really cool.

65
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.974
So I can say, this thing has an artist,

66
00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:16.801
that I can say it's type is Artist,
like that, and

67
00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:21.820
if I hit Save,
you can see it just did all this stuff.

68
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.804
And then what it did was it
created a relation field and

69
00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:30.060
it's going to map to the artist ID, so
that's how it knows what artists to go to.

70
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.790
That's an integer.

71
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.910
And it's referencing the ID field
on the artist which is here.

72
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.558
And then on the artist side, it went and

73
00:03:40.558 --> 00:03:45.310
made a song field that is of type
array of songs, which is pretty cool.

74
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.150
Only thing I will do is just lowercase is
field to be a lowercase s for a song and

75
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.610
I'm gonna pluralize it to say songs.

76
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.110
There we go.
