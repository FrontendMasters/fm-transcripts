WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.266
Now that that's out the way,
we can start working on our player.

2
00:00:03.266 --> 00:00:06.075
And the player is gonna go down here
where the obvious empty space is

3
00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:07.490
right here where it says player.

4
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.255
And we already have a space carved out for
it, everything is ready,

5
00:00:11.255 --> 00:00:13.048
all we have to do is build it out.

6
00:00:13.048 --> 00:00:18.840
So what we're gonna do is, make a new
component inside of the components folder.

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.641
We're gonna call that playerBar.tsx,

8
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:26.860
actually looks like already created it so
yeah.

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.869
PlayerBar.tsx, and
inside of it all we're gonna do

10
00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.000
is import a Box and
a Flex from chakra layout like that.

11
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.333
And I'm just gonna make a Hello World
component, like I always do

12
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.089
just to get this thing on a page so we can
actually see it while we're designing it.

13
00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:55.742
Return a Box, Like so,

14
00:00:55.742 --> 00:01:00.210
and then we're gonna use this player
bar inside of the player layout.

15
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.982
Right where you see the word
player that we typed in or

16
00:01:02.982 --> 00:01:05.700
whatever placeholder text
you might have placed.

17
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.734
It's just gonna go right underneath
where we rendering the children,

18
00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.209
which is underneath the sidebar.

19
00:01:10.209 --> 00:01:14.498
So just gonna replace that
with a player bar, so

20
00:01:14.498 --> 00:01:20.299
I'm gonna import my PlayerBar,
and I'm gonna render it here.

21
00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:29.363
And now if I go back to my page I can see
that now the player ball component is now

22
00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:32.140
actually been rendered,
and we are good to go.

23
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.190
We're ready to style this thing, so
the PlayerBar's gonna be the container.

24
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.489
It's not actually gonna
have all the controls and

25
00:01:38.489 --> 00:01:42.328
the buttons we'll make another component
of that cuz that components can be huge.

26
00:01:42.328 --> 00:01:46.066
Cuz there's so much state we have to
keep track of and, animations and,

27
00:01:46.066 --> 00:01:46.934
there's a lot.

28
00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:49.749
So the player bars is gonna be
a container for everything and

29
00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.310
it will make a sub component inside of
it that does all the other cool stuff.

30
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.328
So as far as the container goes,
if we look at the design one more time.

31
00:01:58.328 --> 00:02:01.412
It just looks like a dark gray
box with some padding in it, and

32
00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:03.599
it just lays out three different columns.

33
00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:06.863
We got one column on the left her,
we got one column here in the middle, and

34
00:02:06.863 --> 00:02:09.210
then we have this one column on the right.

35
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.039
So that's basically
the job of this PlayerBar,

36
00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:16.533
containers is to do the right coloring
background and get the columns right.

37
00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:20.529
And then each one of these columns will
be like their own component basically, so

38
00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:21.500
let's do that.

39
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.755
Let's head over to this PlayerBar here,
and we'll get started.

40
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:30.211
Because we are making those columns,
we're gonna use flex here so,

41
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:31.530
that's gotta be a thing.

42
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.455
And we'll probably be
getting started with that but

43
00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:38.917
before let's get the container set.

44
00:02:38.917 --> 00:02:43.893
I believe we carved out 100 pixels and
margin for that space,

45
00:02:43.893 --> 00:02:47.041
so I'm just gonna just reinforce that.

46
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:52.653
And make this box also have a height
of 100 pixels just to be explicit,

47
00:02:52.653 --> 00:02:55.515
so it's hey you're 100 pixels.

48
00:02:55.515 --> 00:02:59.136
And then as far as the width, it's full
width so we can say 100 view width,

49
00:02:59.136 --> 00:03:01.360
that'll give us a full width.

50
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.381
Background we're gonna do gray.900,

51
00:03:04.381 --> 00:03:09.287
which is as close to black as we can
get without actually, being black.

52
00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:14.343
And then padding is going to
be about 10 pixels all around.

53
00:03:17.136 --> 00:03:20.052
And then because we have
those three columns,

54
00:03:20.052 --> 00:03:24.258
it makes sense to just go ahead and
do a flex immediately, like so.

55
00:03:24.258 --> 00:03:28.200
And then we wanna make sure that all those
columns are even, and things like that.

56
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.550
So we'll just say align,
Center just to make sure it's all good.

57
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.464
Maybe the padding may help, we might
not need that, but we'll try that.

58
00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:46.710
And then once we get here, what we're
gonna work on is the first column so

59
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.594
the first column is gonna be,
this information over here.

60
00:03:49.594 --> 00:03:54.700
So we'll do the song name, and
the artist name, so we'll do that.

61
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.747
So I'm just gonna go ahead and just make
it inline right now, we could probably

62
00:03:57.747 --> 00:04:00.718
take this out and make another component
later depending on how big it gets.

63
00:04:00.718 --> 00:04:05.148
But for now is gonna make it here,
it's gonna be a box, and

64
00:04:05.148 --> 00:04:08.141
it's going to have some padding on it.

65
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:12.839
Let's add some padding I don't know
about 20 pixels something like that,

66
00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.656
we'll do some padding here.

67
00:04:14.656 --> 00:04:20.632
The text is gonna be white so
I'm gonna say color white, Like that.

68
00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:23.231
And then like I said,
we're not gonna do the album arts,

69
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.003
we're just gonna do the song title and
then the artist name.

70
00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:29.588
So we really just need to
get the text component, and

71
00:04:29.588 --> 00:04:32.209
we'll just put two text things here.

72
00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:35.460
And they stack on top of each other
by default, which is what we want, so

73
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.156
we got one text, we got another one.

74
00:04:37.156 --> 00:04:39.387
And the first one would just be
the name of the artists or I'm sorry,

75
00:04:39.387 --> 00:04:40.105
the name of the song.

76
00:04:40.105 --> 00:04:43.001
So I'm just gonna hard code
something called song name here,

77
00:04:43.001 --> 00:04:45.403
and then the next one will
just be the artists name.

78
00:04:45.403 --> 00:04:49.891
So then I'll say artists name here,
I'll save that so

79
00:04:49.891 --> 00:04:54.491
we can see, how close we are as
far as what it looks like.

80
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:58.530
We'll go back we'll check it out, and
you can see here we got the song name,

81
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.075
we got the artist name,
we need to adjust them.

82
00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:03.705
I think the song needs to be way
bigger compared to the artist name.

83
00:05:03.705 --> 00:05:06.238
So, we'll go to this first text for
the song name and

84
00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:07.975
we'll give it a font size of large.

85
00:05:09.525 --> 00:05:14.161
You could just spell it out like that and
then for the artist name,

86
00:05:14.161 --> 00:05:19.155
we'll give it a fontSize of small
which should just be sm, like that.

87
00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:24.042
So now I got those two I'm just
gonna capitalize this, there we go.

88
00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:28.956
So we got the song name we got the artist
name, looking a little better here.

89
00:05:31.688 --> 00:05:37.177
And then the next thing that we wanna
do is we want to make a column for

90
00:05:37.177 --> 00:05:41.309
the the player like the actual controls,
right?

91
00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:44.575
But before that we gotta think about like
how big we want these columns to be.

92
00:05:44.575 --> 00:05:48.156
So, if all columns combined is 100%,

93
00:05:48.156 --> 00:05:53.680
what is the width of this section
compared to, everything else?

94
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.138
I mean if we look at the design,
just roughly looking at it,

95
00:05:57.138 --> 00:06:00.127
I mean you have to account for
the invisible space.

96
00:06:00.127 --> 00:06:03.887
I mean this thing is centered, I would
say that, the column on the left and

97
00:06:03.887 --> 00:06:07.490
the column on the right
are the same size and width.

98
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.470
And obviously the one in the middle
is bigger so, I would say something

99
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:15.466
that seems about right is,
making this 30%, making this 30%.

100
00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:20.773
Which makes this one 40%, so
this one is 40% these two are 30, cuz

101
00:06:20.773 --> 00:06:26.518
if this one is leading on the left I mean
this column actaully ends here, right?

102
00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:27.913
And then this one stops here, yeah so

103
00:06:27.913 --> 00:06:31.890
there actually bigger than they look they
just dont have that much content in them.

104
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.106
Or they have actually one, two,
three, four, five columns and

105
00:06:35.106 --> 00:06:39.240
these two columns are just empty spaces,
that could also be the fact.

106
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.992
But, I'm not a fan of adding empty flex
columns, I don't really like doing that.

107
00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:48.023
It's a tactic that people use it works but
that's not something I do,

108
00:06:48.023 --> 00:06:52.959
I'm just gonna make these bigger so, I'm
just gonna make this one a width of 30%.

109
00:06:58.363 --> 00:07:02.490
And then as far as the controls, that'll
just be in its own box right underneath

110
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.409
and that will have a width of 40%.

111
00:07:06.516 --> 00:07:09.168
And then I could put in
like controls here, and

112
00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:12.140
we'll kind of see what that looks like.

113
00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.788
So I'll go back, we'll check it out yeah,

114
00:07:14.788 --> 00:07:18.453
that seems about right controls
are gonna start right here.

115
00:07:18.453 --> 00:07:20.777
They'll come mostly to the middle and

116
00:07:20.777 --> 00:07:24.848
then something else that other
controls will go here on the right.

117
00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:29.340
So, that seems about right if not
we'll adjust the percentages of that.
