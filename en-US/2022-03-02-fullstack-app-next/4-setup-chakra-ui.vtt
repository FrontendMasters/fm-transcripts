1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.611
So let's hop into the code here and
the first thing is like I said,

2
00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:08.872
we really want to think about
how we're gonna do that layout.

3
00:00:08.872 --> 00:00:13.523
The sweet thing about Next.js is that
there's many ways to do layouts in

4
00:00:13.523 --> 00:00:14.296
Next.js.

5
00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:19.169
In React is actually quite simple
because you have access to

6
00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:23.670
the entry level component
that you made in React.

7
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.750
So you can put whatever you want there.

8
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.287
Whereas in Next.js depending on,
if you haven't used Next.js then the way

9
00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:36.923
that that works is each page is you can
opt into how you want to render each page.

10
00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:39.997
You can either render it on the server,
you can render it on a client,

11
00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:43.451
you can do static generation ahead of time
or you can do a hybrid of all of them.

12
00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:45.400
There's like many different
ways you can do it.

13
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.353
So depending on that,

14
00:00:48.353 --> 00:00:53.520
that's gonna determine how those
layout components actually behave.

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.572
So you might not be able to do
some of the same things you did

16
00:00:56.572 --> 00:00:58.551
in React that you can do in Next.js.

17
00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:01.093
So there is a couple ways
you can do it in Next.js and

18
00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:04.660
then we're gonna go through the one
that I think is gonna work the best.

19
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.949
So the first thing we're gonna do is
actually install the UI library that we're

20
00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:13.447
gonna be using because we're not gonna
make up all these components from scratch.

21
00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:17.021
We would be here forever trying to do all
that stuff, so we're gonna work with a UI

22
00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:20.455
lib that comes with a bunch of components
so that we can style them from there.

23
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.490
You should already have it installed
if you ran that NPM install thing.

24
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.091
If you go check your package JSON
is actually called Chakra UI.

25
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.340
They have a really great
documentation website.

26
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.370
I'm actually gonna head over there now so
you can take a look at it.

27
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.620
And the reason I chose this one because I
think they have a really good combination

28
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.263
of some really nice
components already created.

29
00:01:40.263 --> 00:01:44.655
But also how you can enhance and
style those components is really cool.

30
00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:47.154
One thing that I don't like about
component libraries is like,

31
00:01:47.154 --> 00:01:48.890
you want to change the style
of this component?

32
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.050
Too bad, you can't.

33
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.510
Or, you got to import the CSS file,

34
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.266
which importing CSS files is not
the best way in my opinion to add CSS to

35
00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:02.448
a JavaScript app because CSS is global and
they got a lot of problems there.

36
00:02:02.448 --> 00:02:05.893
So I like to have my CSS scoped and
I really want to live as close

37
00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:10.487
to the JavaScript as possible, if not in
a JavaScript, they allow us to do that so

38
00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:13.075
we're gonna be using Chakra for
all of that.

39
00:02:13.075 --> 00:02:16.904
So in order to install it,
this is a couple things we need to do.

40
00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:21.090
Let's do the layout stuff, so
we'll head over to underscore app.

41
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.336
And again,
this is the entry part to our app,

42
00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:28.200
this is where if you've ever used React,
there's this concept of providers.

43
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.357
A provider is just like a component that
provides context for your whole app.

44
00:02:32.357 --> 00:02:36.470
Context is state that can be shared and
accessed at any component.

45
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.290
A provider just gives every
component rendered inside of

46
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.350
it access to that context.

47
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.836
So Chakra UI actually comes with
the provider that we'll be using, and

48
00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:48.994
we can import that and
wrap our app inside of that.

49
00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:56.084
So we'll import from what is it,
at Chakra UI React, and

50
00:02:56.084 --> 00:03:02.310
what we wanna import is
gonna be Chakra provider.

51
00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.508
So Chakra provider, and we're also gonna
do this other called extend theme,

52
00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:06.495
because we have a mostly dark theme and
by default it's a light theme.

53
00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:12.491
And some of their grays were really off
they were like bluish gray which is kind

54
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:19.057
of weird so I made them like real gray, so
we'll do that, we're gonna import that.

55
00:03:19.057 --> 00:03:24.140
Another thing we're gonna import is gonna
be the reset CSS, so what I'm gonna

56
00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.320
do is I'm gonna get rid of this global
CSS that Next.js had imported at the top.

57
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.487
Like I said, we're not gonna use any of
the CSS that came with this scaffold, so

58
00:03:32.487 --> 00:03:33.777
I'm just gonna get rid of that.

59
00:03:33.777 --> 00:03:36.961
And instead of gonna import
something called reset CSS,

60
00:03:36.961 --> 00:03:40.885
which should already be installed
from the package JSON that you had.

61
00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:44.940
All this is gonna do is reset the CSS
to be the same in every single browser.

62
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.690
All browsers apply
default CSS differently.

63
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.075
This just resets it so that it's
all the same, so that'll do that.

64
00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:56.786
And then the next thing I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna fix this theme from Chakra.

65
00:03:56.786 --> 00:04:01.409
And the way that this works is I can make
a theme objects like so, so I'm gonna say

66
00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.415
theme and it's going to extend
a theme which is gonna take an object.

67
00:04:05.415 --> 00:04:10.482
And really the only things that I want
to change here are gonna be the colors.

68
00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:13.932
So I'm gonna change some of the colors,
specifically the gray one, like I said,

69
00:04:13.932 --> 00:04:17.090
it was like bluish gray and
I thought that was weird.

70
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.048
So what I did was I went to the Material
Design website that has all these colors,

71
00:04:21.048 --> 00:04:23.070
and they had a really nice gray palette.

72
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.610
So I just copied all of those and I'm just
gonna add them here because I thought

73
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.130
those were more true to gray than
the bluish gray that Chakra had.

74
00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.250
So the way that that works is you
give it a number like 100 and

75
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.510
then you give it a color.

76
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.940
So for 100, I'm gonna do,
I think this one is F5f5f5, like so.

77
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.429
And for 200 I'm gonna do EEEEEE.

78
00:04:46.429 --> 00:04:49.698
And then for 300,

79
00:04:49.698 --> 00:04:55.694
I think this one is gonna be E0E0E0.

80
00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:59.306
And then for 400,

81
00:04:59.306 --> 00:05:04.128
let's do BDBD, so BDBDBD.

82
00:05:04.128 --> 00:05:12.718
And 500 is gonna be 9E9E9E.

83
00:05:12.718 --> 00:05:15.709
600, this is gonna go all the way
up to 900 by the way, [LAUGH].

84
00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:21.232
600 is gonna be 75 or,

85
00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:27.865
yeah 757575, oops.

86
00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:31.721
And 700 is gonna be 616161.

87
00:05:35.048 --> 00:05:41.185
And 800 is gonna be 424242.

88
00:05:41.185 --> 00:05:43.888
And then lastly 900 is gonna be 212121.

89
00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:48.565
There we go.

90
00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:51.519
So now we got some true grays in here.

91
00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:54.862
The other thing I want to do is that,
for some reason, well,

92
00:05:54.862 --> 00:05:59.323
I guess this makes sense but all of the
anchor tags, especially the button anchor

93
00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:03.080
tags have the underlying on them,
and they have this weird shadow.

94
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.730
So I want to get rid of that too.

95
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.226
So the way that I can do that is I can
come down here and I can say, components,

96
00:06:09.226 --> 00:06:12.370
not composition, but components like so.

97
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.440
And now this allows me to
extend any of the components.

98
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.610
I want to extend a Button
component with a capital B.

99
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.110
And I wanna change one of its variants.

100
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.222
So variance is like the type of button.

101
00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:27.285
Most theming UI libraries have this
concept of variance where a variance

102
00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:31.684
is like I have a big button,
a small button, a success button,

103
00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:35.980
error button, all these different
variations of a button.

104
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.430
So I wanna change one of the variations
called the link variation.

105
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.307
So there's this concept
of a link button and

106
00:06:43.307 --> 00:06:47.271
I wanna change that to where when
we focus on the link button,

107
00:06:47.271 --> 00:06:51.882
I want to get rid of the outline that
it puts on it which is pretty gross.

108
00:06:51.882 --> 00:06:55.443
So I'm gonna say none, and
then I want to add a box shadow or

109
00:06:55.443 --> 00:06:59.606
I want to get rid of the box shadow
that's on it so I am gonna say none.

110
00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:02.819
So just doing all that to adjust
the theme and with Chakra UI,

111
00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.844
you can pretty much do whatever
you want with this theme.

112
00:07:05.844 --> 00:07:09.268
You could put your own custom
color palette as you saw,

113
00:07:09.268 --> 00:07:14.258
you can change all different variations,
you can make different variations,

114
00:07:14.258 --> 00:07:17.470
you can do all types of wonderful stuff.

115
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.860
So I really like this component
live because it's super extensible.

116
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.020
And I'm gonna push this up to
GitHub after I've done too.

117
00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.960
So if you don't get the exact colors down,
that's fine.

118
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.458
They're gonna come in handy later,

119
00:07:26.458 --> 00:07:28.640
I mean your colors will just
be off until we get there.

120
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.291
So don't worry about trying
to get them all right now.

121
00:07:32.291 --> 00:07:37.091
And then finally what we need to do
is we need to wrap our component in

122
00:07:37.091 --> 00:07:38.740
the Chakra provider.

123
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.944
So I'm gonna say Chakra provider like so,
put our component back in there.

124
00:07:43.944 --> 00:07:48.487
And then the last thing I need to do
is just parse the thing that we made,

125
00:07:48.487 --> 00:07:50.740
was just gonna be theme like that.

126
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.019
Any questions on extending
the theme with Chakra UI?

127
00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:58.663
And like I said, most component
lives follow this convention of

128
00:07:58.663 --> 00:08:03.823
creating a theme file and then extending
it and adding it to a provider.

129
00:08:03.823 --> 00:08:07.971
It's pretty common thing now so
it's not something unique to Chakra but

130
00:08:07.971 --> 00:08:09.544
I think it's really cool.

131
00:08:09.544 --> 00:08:14.189
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE] accessibility
why is that doesn't seem

132
00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:17.760
like a good idea to [INAUDIBLE] to focus?

133
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.440
&gt;&gt; Yeah, accessibility wise,
it probably isn't a good idea.

134
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.400
But at the same time, I'm following
the exact design that the Spotify app has.

135
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.640
So I guess Spotify doesn't
care about accessibility.
