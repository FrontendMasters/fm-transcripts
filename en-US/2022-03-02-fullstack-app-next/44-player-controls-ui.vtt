WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.825
So, let's hop right into it and get these
controls done for the actual player.

2
00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:11.223
So if we zoom in on this a little bit
,it looks like we have a shuffle button.

3
00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:15.871
A previous button, a play slash
pause button, a next button, and

4
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.450
then a repeat button.

5
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.332
And then followed by a track or
seek bar, however you wanna call it.

6
00:00:21.332 --> 00:00:25.343
That shows the current runtime and
then the full duration.

7
00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:29.879
So and as you anticipate, we do expect
that to move as time goes on and

8
00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.722
click to seek drag to seek.

9
00:00:31.722 --> 00:00:35.114
So we will attempt to
get all of that done.

10
00:00:35.114 --> 00:00:36.672
And let's hop right into it.

11
00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:40.188
So what we'll do is we'll
come into our code.

12
00:00:40.188 --> 00:00:43.812
And we'll make a new component here and
we're gonna call this just the player.

13
00:00:43.812 --> 00:00:47.203
Player dot TSX in the component folder.

14
00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:51.001
So, first thing first is we're gonna
import some of the things for our UI,

15
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.707
which is gonna come from chakra.

16
00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:54.656
It's been so good to us lately.

17
00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:59.230
We'll just keep using it, and
it's gonna be a lot of stuff here.

18
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.095
So, a couple things.

19
00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.937
They have this really cool
thing called a button group.

20
00:01:04.937 --> 00:01:09.821
We'll use that that's just basically a
bunch of buttons put together next to each

21
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:10.331
other.

22
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:13.241
So we gotta use a flex
container to do that.

23
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:16.182
We're gonna use a box obviously,
we're gonna use the icon button.

24
00:01:16.182 --> 00:01:18.612
We use that one another
component that was really cool.

25
00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:21.160
I think for
that big play button we use that.

26
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.699
Then a bunch of things for
the actual seekbar.

27
00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:26.906
There's a range slider,
that we're gonna use.

28
00:01:26.906 --> 00:01:32.846
And some other things
that come with that is

29
00:01:32.846 --> 00:01:38.292
gonna be a range slider field to track.

30
00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:42.337
A range slider track, yeah there we go and

31
00:01:42.337 --> 00:01:46.277
then another one is range slider thumb.

32
00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:50.489
So all those are gonna work together
that give us that nice seekbar.

33
00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.814
We're gonna use the center component which
I'm pretty sure just figures out how to

34
00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.189
center things based off.

35
00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.436
Whatever situation is basically
a magic flexbox thing.

36
00:01:59.436 --> 00:02:00.476
It's pretty awesome.

37
00:02:00.476 --> 00:02:06.736
We're using the flex container and
then we're gonna use the text.

38
00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:09.096
So we're gonna use all of those.

39
00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:16.970
And then we're also gonna import
a really cool library called react.

40
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.296
Howler so reacts HOWLER

41
00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:25.843
from react dash howler.

42
00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:33.511
So howler JS is the number one standards
audio interface library for JavaScript.

43
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:37.551
It's not something native to react this
library rhapsody it makes it native

44
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:38.125
to react.

45
00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.242
So it's gonna do a lot
of the heavy lifting for

46
00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:44.000
us as far as interfacing with the audio
but it's not gonna create either the UI.

47
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.961
It doesn't do any UI stuff for

48
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:50.679
us it just gives us the mechanism of
loading of playing a foul or a sound.

49
00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:53.407
Without this it would be much,
much difficult.

50
00:02:53.407 --> 00:02:56.441
Or I guess we could just use
an issue of file player or audio.

51
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:59.172
That's not so bad,
this thing just abstract a lot.

52
00:02:59.172 --> 00:03:02.442
Makes it so easy to do so
we'll be interacting with this but

53
00:03:02.442 --> 00:03:05.869
we still gotta do all of the UI
all the state stuff ourselves.

54
00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:09.193
We just don't have to manipulate
the actual song itself.

55
00:03:09.193 --> 00:03:14.487
So we got that we're gonna
import some stuff from react.

56
00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:20.094
So we're gonna have here is gonna be
I've got some use effects going on.

57
00:03:20.094 --> 00:03:22.474
We're gonna have some use refs going on so

58
00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:25.880
we get a reference to the react
taller when it's rendered.

59
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.706
And some states because we gotta
keep track of a bunch of stuff.

60
00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:36.781
So you state and then we're gonna
also pull in some icons and stuff.

61
00:03:36.781 --> 00:03:41.344
So from the icons,
we're gonna pull from react icons.

62
00:03:41.344 --> 00:03:44.927
And I think it's gonna be slash MD for
material.

63
00:03:44.927 --> 00:03:46.490
I really like their icons.

64
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:52.138
The ones we're gonna use are gonna
be MD shuffle for that shuffle.

65
00:03:52.138 --> 00:03:52.693
There we go.

66
00:03:52.693 --> 00:03:57.474
We're also gonna use MD, previous lines

67
00:03:57.474 --> 00:04:02.126
on the wifi like a component there we go.

68
00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:07.754
And then we're gonna also
use MD next otherwise or

69
00:04:07.754 --> 00:04:14.994
I'm sorry in the skip previous
MD skip that Next let's do that.

70
00:04:14.994 --> 00:04:20.924
And then we're gonna use MD
outline play cicle filled,

71
00:04:20.924 --> 00:04:27.373
I think we did that one before,
outline play circle filled.

72
00:04:27.373 --> 00:04:32.317
And then another one MD
outline circle filled.

73
00:04:37.113 --> 00:04:39.623
And then the last one is Md,
outline, repeat.

74
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.812
Md, my repeats repeats

75
00:04:49.812 --> 00:04:53.873
there we go okay.

76
00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:58.460
So we got that and then lastly we're
gonna do a little more import for

77
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.530
our action that we just
created in our store.

78
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.957
So we wanna be able to use that so
we can import from easy-peasy and

79
00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:11.015
we're gonna use a hook
called use store action.

80
00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:15.160
And that'll let us use
the action that we created.

81
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.223
Cool, so lots of imports,
a lot of things happen there.

82
00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:26.867
And it's totally fine if you don't
import all these right now because as

83
00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:28.498
we go along well we can import them.

84
00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:30.844
So which is what I would
normally do in the code anyway,

85
00:05:30.844 --> 00:05:32.637
I will import them as I'm building them.

86
00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:35.161
I just don't wanna be scrolling up and
down to the page as I'm building for

87
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:35.946
the sake of teaching.

88
00:05:35.946 --> 00:05:36.821
Yes.

89
00:05:36.821 --> 00:05:41.567
&gt;&gt; Did you just import easy-peasy we
didn't actually import our store?

90
00:05:41.567 --> 00:05:44.797
&gt;&gt; We imported something called use
store actions from easy-peasy but

91
00:05:44.797 --> 00:05:46.696
yeah we're not gonna import the store.

92
00:05:46.696 --> 00:05:49.990
It's already provided through
the provider that we added so

93
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.711
every component has access to it already,
yeah.

94
00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.871
All right, let's make this player, so

95
00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:05.629
const player, equals our component here.

96
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.221
Always, I'm just gonna default export it
right quick and put something in there.

97
00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:13.693
And get it rendered on the page so we can
build it and see it at the same time.

98
00:06:13.693 --> 00:06:17.487
Just gonna return a box here.

99
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:26.319
Save that, and then the player
is gonna go into player bar.

100
00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.307
So we'll default export
that go to the player bar,

101
00:06:29.307 --> 00:06:32.650
here where I put controls which
is basically in this box.

102
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.515
That's, has a 40% width.

103
00:06:34.515 --> 00:06:38.070
This is where we're gonna put the player,

104
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:42.629
so, player in here,
I need to import it, there we go.

105
00:06:48.012 --> 00:06:50.301
So let's go verify that it works.

106
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:53.311
You can see hello from player,
players loaded up.

107
00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:57.464
Now we can actually make
this thing look good.

108
00:06:57.464 --> 00:06:59.091
So there's a lot going
on here I keep saying.

109
00:06:59.091 --> 00:07:03.159
So what we're gonna do first is just try
to get the UI down with no interactions

110
00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:03.729
no state.

111
00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:06.921
And then we'll move on to adding
the state and the handlers.

112
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:10.332
And then lastly, we'll get the interaction
down and we can finally play it.

113
00:07:10.332 --> 00:07:12.718
So a couple steps to get
this player working.

114
00:07:12.718 --> 00:07:16.966
So heading back to the player, I said,
we're just gonna start with the UI first.

115
00:07:16.966 --> 00:07:20.870
Let's just kinda get that going and then
we'll move up and do all the other things.

116
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.868
So the first thing is let's we have our
box, put this on another line here.

117
00:07:25.868 --> 00:07:30.550
Got our box here, which is gonna
be the container for everything.

118
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.275
And then what I need to do is I
need to render the react handler.

119
00:07:35.275 --> 00:07:37.104
It's actually a component.

120
00:07:37.104 --> 00:07:40.257
Like I said,
it doesn't have a visual interface to it.

121
00:07:40.257 --> 00:07:43.186
It's just something that has
to be put in the Dom and

122
00:07:43.186 --> 00:07:45.922
then we can reference it
using the use ref hook.

123
00:07:45.922 --> 00:07:48.880
So I'm gonna add another box here.

124
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.189
And then I'm gonna render the reacts.

125
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:54.552
Howler component like this.

126
00:07:54.552 --> 00:07:56.150
It has a bunch of props on it.

127
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.689
We won't deal with those props right now.

128
00:07:57.689 --> 00:08:02.291
We'll wait till we get to actually
adding state and stuff like that but

129
00:08:02.291 --> 00:08:04.798
we have that there so we have this box.

130
00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:10.050
The next thing I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna use the center component.

131
00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.935
I'm using this component for
the buttons, yeah,

132
00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:16.169
that thing's gonna freak out
because I want some props.

133
00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:21.244
I'm using the center component for these
buttons here because I wanna center them.

134
00:08:21.244 --> 00:08:23.739
It's gonna center those
buttons in the center.

135
00:08:23.739 --> 00:08:27.140
So do that.

136
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.556
And as we're building it's out if we don't
wanna see this error if you actually wanna

137
00:08:30.556 --> 00:08:31.609
see where you're doing.

138
00:08:31.609 --> 00:08:34.547
Just comment out the react taller
until we get to it stellify.

139
00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:37.004
You'll need to put it in
there if you don't wanna,

140
00:08:37.004 --> 00:08:40.050
I'll leave my commented out so
it doesn't break everything.

141
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.857
So do the center component here.

142
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:45.584
Then we'll do the button group.

143
00:08:45.584 --> 00:08:48.412
So we get all those buttons in there.

144
00:08:48.412 --> 00:08:51.402
So we got our button group here.

145
00:08:51.402 --> 00:08:52.487
And then for the button group,

146
00:08:52.487 --> 00:08:54.380
you can just throw whatever
buttons you want to here.

147
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:59.125
We're gonna use the icon buttons, so when
I say icon button, this be the first one.

148
00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:03.133
And this one is gonna be pretty sure
this will be the shuffle one, so

149
00:09:03.133 --> 00:09:04.931
this will be the shuffle one.

150
00:09:04.931 --> 00:09:08.169
So we're gonna go back here.

151
00:09:08.169 --> 00:09:10.686
We're gonna give it a outline of nuns,

152
00:09:10.686 --> 00:09:14.210
I think by default they have
this weird outline on him.

153
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.964
So we're gonna take that off,

154
00:09:15.964 --> 00:09:19.481
which looks like a border variance
will be the link variants.

155
00:09:22.877 --> 00:09:27.824
And then what we're gonna do is as far

156
00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:32.301
as color, we'll just say gray.

157
00:09:32.301 --> 00:09:35.873
600 like that in fact all these
are probably gonna be the same color.

158
00:09:35.873 --> 00:09:41.164
So what I'll probably do is just
move this color up to the center so

159
00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:44.640
everything but needed has the same color.

160
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:48.689
It's gonna freak out if we don't add
an ARIA label to these icon buttons on

161
00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:49.421
ARIA label.

162
00:09:49.421 --> 00:09:53.383
And I'm just gonna call it shuffle,
like so.

163
00:09:53.383 --> 00:09:59.196
Font size is gonna be 24 pixels or
whatever you feel works.

164
00:09:59.196 --> 00:10:03.030
Let's save it so I can format it.

165
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.232
And then for the icon we're gonna render.

166
00:10:05.232 --> 00:10:10.347
And make sure you render this as an use

167
00:10:10.347 --> 00:10:15.630
these JSX brackets, the MD shuffle.

168
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.040
So I'm not sure how familiar
you all might be with JSX.

169
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.806
But at the end of the day,
if you look at the output of JSX,

170
00:10:20.806 --> 00:10:23.180
each one of these components
is a function call.

171
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.481
Right?
And props are arguments to that function,

172
00:10:25.481 --> 00:10:27.300
children arguments to that function.

173
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.339
And when you render a component
like this with the brackets,

174
00:10:30.339 --> 00:10:32.971
you're invoking the function
you're calling it.

175
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:38.883
So they just think about that when you see
these components, the difference between.

176
00:10:38.883 --> 00:10:43.080
Just referencing a component out
here versus wrapping it in brackets.

177
00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.308
Is the difference between just referencing
a function versus actually calling it.

178
00:10:48.308 --> 00:10:53.670
Cool so we got our MD shuffle there,
to show up,

179
00:10:53.670 --> 00:11:02.266
I don't know if mine actually showed
up let's see I can't actually see it.

180
00:11:02.266 --> 00:11:04.212
Maybe I can make sure it's
not a different colors.

181
00:11:04.212 --> 00:11:06.126
I'll just let me check the DOM.

182
00:11:06.126 --> 00:11:10.704
I put icons with poro
should be icon singular.

183
00:11:10.704 --> 00:11:11.924
That'll do it.

184
00:11:11.924 --> 00:11:12.452
There we go.

185
00:11:12.452 --> 00:11:15.760
So now we got the shuffle icon there,
it's gray.

186
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.520
And we'll do the same thing for
all the other icons.

187
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.638
So the next one is gonna be,
previous than play pause the next repeat.

188
00:11:23.638 --> 00:11:27.084
So I'm just gonna copy and
just switch them out so

189
00:11:27.084 --> 00:11:32.988
look at this other icon here for shuffle
for underneath it we'll change this to MD.

190
00:11:32.988 --> 00:11:36.273
Skip previous so we got that.

191
00:11:40.422 --> 00:11:43.239
And then we're gonna make two for
the play and

192
00:11:43.239 --> 00:11:46.739
we're gonna make one for
the play and one for the pause.

193
00:11:46.739 --> 00:11:49.843
But then when we add our state will toggle
them depending on if we're playing or not.

194
00:11:49.843 --> 00:11:53.286
So it's gonna look weird right now until
we add the state because they're both

195
00:11:53.286 --> 00:11:54.233
gonna be on the page.

196
00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:57.403
But when we get the state we'll only show
one depending on if we're playing or not.

197
00:11:57.403 --> 00:12:03.658
So I'm gonna make one here for
the playing so

198
00:12:03.658 --> 00:12:11.279
for playing this one's gonna
be in the outline play.

199
00:12:11.279 --> 00:12:16.051
In the outs line,
play circle fields like so.

200
00:12:16.051 --> 00:12:19.163
And we're gonna make this a little
bigger because other ones are 24.

201
00:12:19.163 --> 00:12:21.301
But look at that button
is actually a lot bigger.

202
00:12:21.301 --> 00:12:26.106
And the color is always gonna be white
because when it's on it's active question.

203
00:12:26.106 --> 00:12:28.895
&gt;&gt; Shouldn't the ARIA
label actually change?

204
00:12:28.895 --> 00:12:32.095
&gt;&gt; Yes, we should change
our labels if we wanna be.

205
00:12:34.613 --> 00:12:38.469
Yeah compliance so
change our labels this one will be skip.

206
00:12:38.469 --> 00:12:42.835
This one will be was this one play.

207
00:12:42.835 --> 00:12:44.489
There we go.

208
00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:51.100
We're gonna make another one for pause.

209
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.090
Should just be able to
replace that with pause,

210
00:12:56.090 --> 00:13:00.970
make that 40 pixels, change that to pause.

211
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:04.754
If you go back, but it's looking good,
they're all lined up perfectly.

212
00:13:04.754 --> 00:13:09.028
Got a play, got a pause,
got a previous got a skip,

213
00:13:09.028 --> 00:13:11.819
all we need is a next and a repeat.

214
00:13:11.819 --> 00:13:16.311
So for the next one I believe it's

215
00:13:16.311 --> 00:13:21.286
called indy skip next make sure you go

216
00:13:21.286 --> 00:13:25.789
back to 24 pixels for that one.

217
00:13:25.789 --> 00:13:32.706
That looks good yeah this also should not
be white, should be great, looks great.

218
00:13:32.706 --> 00:13:37.492
And then the last one will just be,
repeat.

219
00:13:41.903 --> 00:13:44.073
So this will be, what is it?

220
00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:45.299
Md outline repeat.

221
00:13:49.975 --> 00:13:54.465
And change the label to repeat.

222
00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:58.655
There we go.
So we got all our icons, I mean it's kinda

223
00:13:58.655 --> 00:14:03.493
quite a lot of JSX here,
I mean that I guess we could.

224
00:14:03.493 --> 00:14:06.645
Do what I did before and take some of this
out, put it in an array iterate over it,

225
00:14:06.645 --> 00:14:08.311
but because a lot of these are gonna have.

226
00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:10.934
Click handlers on them,
that's where it gets complicated is,

227
00:14:10.934 --> 00:14:12.889
okay, but
now you have to find click handlers.

228
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:16.471
And some array outside of a component
where the functions don't even exist yet.

229
00:14:16.471 --> 00:14:19.227
So probably not each kept
do a bunch of crazy stuff.

230
00:14:19.227 --> 00:14:20.970
So we're just gonna render
them in here like this.
