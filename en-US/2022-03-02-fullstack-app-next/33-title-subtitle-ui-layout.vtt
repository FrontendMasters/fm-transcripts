1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.236
Almost there.

2
00:00:01.236 --> 00:00:03.192
We'll keep moving, so we got the image.

3
00:00:03.192 --> 00:00:05.723
The next thing is to start
making the container for

4
00:00:05.723 --> 00:00:08.746
the content that's gonna go to
the right of the image here.

5
00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:12.357
So if we go back and look at our design
I'm talking about this content here, so

6
00:00:12.357 --> 00:00:14.940
we got the subtitle,
the title and the description.

7
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.139
We're gonna make the container for
that and

8
00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:20.350
then we'll put the props in
there to actually fill it out.

9
00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.831
So, let's do that.

10
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:27.522
So underneath this box and this image,
we'll add another box still inside

11
00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:31.691
the flex cuz we got two children
inside this flex image on the left,

12
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:35.212
content on the right, so
we'll make another box here.

13
00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:40.168
We're gonna add some padding to this,
which will be like 20 pixels, probably.

14
00:00:40.168 --> 00:00:44.316
And then we want to
adjust the line heights.

15
00:00:44.316 --> 00:00:49.275
I found that if we don't adjust the line
height, the title, the subtitle and

16
00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:52.268
description are just too
far from each other.

17
00:00:52.268 --> 00:00:56.610
For some reason the font that trucker's
using, they just look too far to me.

18
00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.714
So I adjusted the line height
to compensate for that, but

19
00:00:59.714 --> 00:01:02.120
you can make that decision yourself.

20
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.974
I just felt like it was too far and there
was no padding and no margin between them,

21
00:01:05.974 --> 00:01:07.630
It was just so far from each other.

22
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.870
I think it's the font.

23
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.890
I don't know what font they're using.

24
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.197
So we're gonna adjust
the line height there,

25
00:01:13.197 --> 00:01:17.560
make it tighter cuz it's by default
that goes more than 40 pixels.

26
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.150
And then we're gonna
use a text thing here.

27
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.196
The text component, literally,
just abstracts away from having to

28
00:01:25.196 --> 00:01:31.770
ever use h1 through h6 or a p tag or span
tag, it just abstracts that away from you.

29
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.721
And you just use the text.

30
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:39.309
I think you can do, as,
it inserts itself whatever you want,

31
00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:42.866
any type of texting and it'll be that.

32
00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:47.340
But I think by default it just
uses paragraph for everything.

33
00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.010
The one was positive, that's what it uses.

34
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.980
I haven't checked,
we can confirm after I add it.

35
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.040
So for font size,
this will be the subtitle.

36
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.290
I'm gonna make that SM, small.

37
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.580
You can see here all the values,
all the way up to extra, extra small.

38
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.526
I didn't know that was a thing.

39
00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:05.792
And then we want this to be bold.

40
00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:09.383
So we're gonna make font weight, bold and

41
00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:14.180
then casing,
we'll just transform this to uppercase.

42
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.900
And inside of here will be the subtitle.

43
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.754
So I made it small, bold and uppercase
because if you go look at the design,

44
00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:25.960
it's what it is.

45
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.190
It's super small.

46
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.610
It does look bold and
is totally uppercase.

47
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.410
So, that's why I did that.

48
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.010
So we got our subtitle.

49
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.430
The next thing is going
to be the actual title.

50
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.880
So we'll do another text
right underneath it.

51
00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.487
They stack by default.

52
00:02:41.487 --> 00:02:44.716
So like I said,
I think their paragraphs not like spintax.

53
00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:51.047
This will have a font size of six,
XL I think works.

54
00:02:51.047 --> 00:02:55.020
You can play around
with that number title.

55
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.888
So we got our title here and then we
got one more text and that'll be for

56
00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:02.958
the description, the font sizes for
the same font size of the subtitle so

57
00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:04.650
it'll be small.

58
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.366
Although this one is not bold, it's
the opposite of bold, it's actually light.

59
00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:10.246
So I'm gonna say, font weights.

60
00:03:12.748 --> 00:03:16.370
100, which is the lightest value,
you can give a font,

61
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.408
other than making it disappear.

62
00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:20.111
And we'll put description.

63
00:03:21.627 --> 00:03:24.577
So we got our subtitle,
our title and description.

64
00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:27.610
So if you wanna see what this looks like,
we can add some here.

65
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.218
So add a subtitle here,
I'll call it profile.

66
00:03:32.218 --> 00:03:37.646
I'll add a title here,
I'll put my name and

67
00:03:37.646 --> 00:03:41.475
I'll add a description here.

68
00:03:41.475 --> 00:03:43.180
And what is the design say?

69
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.020
Says 15 public playlists,

70
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.941
I'll add that 15 public playlist.

71
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:54.882
So we'll render that and
we'll see what this looks like.

72
00:03:54.882 --> 00:03:56.840
And yeah, pretty close.

73
00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.040
the obvious thing is that it's not white,
it's in gray.

74
00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.266
So we got to change the color
of the text to be whites and

75
00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:04.500
then we can kind of see what
it looks like from there.

76
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.841
So let's go back to our gradient
layout and I think a good

77
00:04:09.841 --> 00:04:15.876
place to put it will probably just
be in this second box for now.

78
00:04:15.876 --> 00:04:18.523
So we can just say color, white.

79
00:04:18.523 --> 00:04:22.404
We'll move it higher, if this whole page
is gonna have white text, we can do that.

80
00:04:22.404 --> 00:04:27.888
Maybe, I just don't know,
don't wanna do that, but there we go.

81
00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:30.820
Got our profile, got our title,
got our description.

82
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.376
It's like the profile is
kinda big compared to this.

83
00:04:35.376 --> 00:04:39.570
I feel like on the design,
this is way bigger than a profile.

84
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.975
So, I don't maybe make the profile or
the subtitle even smaller.

85
00:04:44.975 --> 00:04:50.932
There was like a value was there,
xx small.

86
00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:52.937
Let's see, extra small.

87
00:04:52.937 --> 00:04:56.552
Lets see if that looks like,
yeah, that's a little better, but

88
00:04:56.552 --> 00:04:59.722
this one also has to be extra small too,
they're the same

89
00:05:03.986 --> 00:05:07.367
Okay, but now I don't wanna make that
light, cuz now you can barely read it.

90
00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:18.082
Okay, that's a lot better So
we're getting there,

91
00:05:18.082 --> 00:05:21.667
got our header, got our gradients,
got our content here on the right.

92
00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:24.996
And got our image, we'll put a real
image in there in a minute when we load

93
00:05:24.996 --> 00:05:27.250
the profile and do all the database stuff.

94
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.635
But I guess if you want to see
what it looks with the image,

95
00:05:29.635 --> 00:05:31.490
you can go to the design notes.

96
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.640
I have this one here, or
you can put any image you want.

97
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.723
So you can actually just click view,

98
00:05:37.723 --> 00:05:43.380
original, you can copy
that URL right there.

99
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.748
Just copy that URL, or you can go
back to the Index, add an image and

100
00:05:47.748 --> 00:05:49.550
then put that URL in there.

101
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.644
And then we'll see.

102
00:05:52.644 --> 00:05:53.554
Yeah, there you go.

103
00:05:55.904 --> 00:05:58.500
And then for the profile,
I believe it should be round.

104
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.930
So I'm gonna go ahead and
make that round on the profile here.

105
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.111
So, round image is actually true.

106
00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:04.715
And there you go.

107
00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:21.436
So I'm going to stop here, commit and
push this up before we continue on with

108
00:06:21.436 --> 00:06:25.550
the homepage, cuz I feel like we did a lot
of UI stuff here, lot of prop stuff.
