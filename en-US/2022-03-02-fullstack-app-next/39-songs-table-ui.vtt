1
00:00:00.307 --> 00:00:05.204
So, the next thing that we'll get
through is going to be the songs table.

2
00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:09.667
So, if we go and look at the design,
it's exactly what it sounds like.

3
00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:13.153
It's a table that lists all the songs,
right?

4
00:00:13.153 --> 00:00:16.365
And we wanna go to click on those songs or
click this Play button here and

5
00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:17.890
actually play something.

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.360
So, this is literally the main
job of this music player.

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.230
So, I wanted to do it last
as we come full circle.

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.020
I was gonna do this part first, but then I
was just like, this is the hardest part.

9
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.530
So, I don't know if I wanna start with
that, it's kinda asking for a lot.

10
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.870
So, saved it last.

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.341
So, we'll jump right in and we'll make
the song table, and then tomorrow as we

12
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:43.840
continue on the player bar down here,
and then we'll get this thing deployed.

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.545
So, as far as the song table goes,
if we just look at it,

14
00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:51.980
it looks like a pretty simple table/list.

15
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.220
Its design aesthetic is
the fact that it's minimal.

16
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.460
Yeah, there's not really borders
going on here, it looks really cool.

17
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.174
And then you have this play thing up here,

18
00:01:03.174 --> 00:01:06.830
we don't have the ability to like and
favorite things.

19
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.030
So, we won't be adding that.

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.392
That's one of the things that
I said there'll be left,

21
00:01:10.392 --> 00:01:14.510
if you wanna continue working on this,
you can add that, that'd be really cool.

22
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.091
But we don't have
the ability to do that now.

23
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:20.422
So, what we'll do is we'll start working
on this table as a separate component,

24
00:01:20.422 --> 00:01:21.402
cuz it's a little big.

25
00:01:21.402 --> 00:01:25.320
And then we'll bring it
in the playlist page.

26
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.968
So, let's do that.

27
00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:32.417
I'll head over to components,
make a new component here.

28
00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:38.390
I'm gonna call it songsTable.tsx, And
we'll start working on this thing.

29
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.489
So, gonna import some things from chakra,

30
00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:49.300
let me see, what are we gonna need here?

31
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.890
I know for sure we're gonna need a box,
that's for sure, we use it all the time.

32
00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.086
But chakra also has some table primitives
that we'll be using from the chakra react.

33
00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:05.422
And we want to use the table,
the table head,

34
00:02:05.422 --> 00:02:11.048
the table, what does T stand for
a Td in tables?

35
00:02:11.048 --> 00:02:16.055
I don't know, I know Tr is Table row.

36
00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.323
We got Tbody which is the table body.

37
00:02:19.323 --> 00:02:22.000
And then we'll use the IconButton for
the Play button.

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.696
So, Table, Thead, Tr, Tbody, and
I think there's another one just like Th,

39
00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:37.020
I don't know the h stands for there,
but we'll be using that one as well.

40
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.960
Tables has so many pieces.

41
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.052
So, we'll be using all of these.

42
00:02:42.052 --> 00:02:47.030
We're also gonna use some
icons from react icon.

43
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.804
The ones that I want to use
are gonna be from react-icons/bs,

44
00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.750
I don't know what the bs library is.

45
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.240
Let me go look it up,
cuz they got some nice icons.

46
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.801
I think bs is, that's Bootstrap,
now that makes sense.

47
00:03:03.801 --> 00:03:06.258
These are Bootstrap icons, okay?

48
00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:12.384
Now, we're gonna use Bootstrap icons,

49
00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:17.809
I go back to the code, here we go it's

50
00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:23.597
gonna be called {BsFillPlayfill}.

51
00:03:23.597 --> 00:03:26.019
Yeah, PlayFill, there we go, okay?

52
00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.848
And then we got another one, that's gonna
come from a different part of react-icons.

53
00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:34.740
I think that was gonna come from ai
probably, yeah, Adobe Illustrator.

54
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.330
And this one's gonna be
the {AiOutlineClockCircle}.

55
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.107
So, look at that.

56
00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:51.317
These two icons are specifically for,
if we go back look at the design, the play

57
00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:55.855
one was for this play, and then clock
is for this little one clock over here.

58
00:03:58.218 --> 00:03:59.862
That's what those icons are for.

59
00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:08.372
And eventually, we've got imports
of other things as we format,

60
00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:10.727
there is a duration we wanna format.

61
00:04:10.727 --> 00:04:12.607
There is a bunch of things
we wanna format, but

62
00:04:12.607 --> 00:04:14.114
we'll get to that as we keep moving.

63
00:04:14.114 --> 00:04:16.693
So, let's make the song table.

64
00:04:16.693 --> 00:04:24.460
SongTable exports default SongTable.

65
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.676
As usual, I'm just gonna make a div
in here that just says something, so

66
00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:30.362
I can add it to where it needs to be,
to make sure it renders and

67
00:04:30.362 --> 00:04:31.920
then we can build it that way.

68
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.942
So, I'm gonna put a div in
here that says SongTable.

69
00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:37.985
We're gonna go back to
our playlist id tsx page.

70
00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:41.504
I'm gonna get rid of this div that I
have in between the gradient layout.

71
00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:43.459
And I'm gonna instead
put the SongTable here.

72
00:04:46.294 --> 00:04:46.794
There we go.

73
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.130
So, I got my song table here.

74
00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:50.790
So, I make sure that
it's actually showing up.

75
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.400
It looks like it is the text
is just really gray,

76
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.813
but it's right there, song table.

77
00:04:59.813 --> 00:05:05.137
Cool, so everything's rendering,
let's make this thing beautiful, okay?

78
00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:10.194
So, for the SongTable like I said,
it's literally going to

79
00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:15.615
use most of the table stuff
here from chakra-ui-react.

80
00:05:15.615 --> 00:05:17.111
It's also gonna take in a list of songs,

81
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:18.835
we might as well just take a prop for
that.

82
00:05:18.835 --> 00:05:20.045
So, let's get that ready.

83
00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:23.545
And we can go ahead and
start returning some things.

84
00:05:23.545 --> 00:05:28.005
So, I'm gonna wrap that table in a box,
that way I can control its position.

85
00:05:28.005 --> 00:05:32.210
So, we'll say box, and
I'm gonna make it transparent.

86
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.060
So, I'm gonna say
background ''transparent''.

87
00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:38.298
And the reason I'm doing that is
cuz if you look at the design,

88
00:05:38.298 --> 00:05:42.340
it actually is transparent, I guess
there's a lot of ways you can do that.

89
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.313
You could have just made just
this thing one solid color, and

90
00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:50.790
then make the table user gradient.

91
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.882
But then I started scrolling down
the page and I realized that like, no,

92
00:05:53.882 --> 00:05:56.317
there's no way that table
could have been the gradient,

93
00:05:56.317 --> 00:05:59.359
because like I saw where it ended
the page is actually the gradient, and

94
00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.950
the table was just
transparent on top of it.

95
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.500
So, we're gonna make it transparent.

96
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.690
So, it's just like glass sitting on there,
which is really cool.

97
00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.917
And then now we're going to
make this section up here, so

98
00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:15.400
this play icon and things like that.

99
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.290
So, we gotta start with that.

100
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.739
So, for
that we're gonna make a box-like so,

101
00:06:20.739 --> 00:06:25.286
we're gonna put some padding
about 10 pixels probably, and

102
00:06:25.286 --> 00:06:31.320
add a margin bottom to separate those play
controls from the song table beneath it.

103
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.565
So, margin bottom of 20 pixels,
we can play around with that number.

104
00:06:36.565 --> 00:06:40.062
And then we're gonna use the icon button,

105
00:06:40.062 --> 00:06:45.708
cuz we wanna be able to click on
that play, self-closing like this.

106
00:06:47.744 --> 00:06:52.396
And the icon that we wanna use is
going to be the law firm Bootstrap.

107
00:06:52.396 --> 00:06:56.098
So, to be {BsPlayFill} like that.

108
00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:04.963
I think we have to render it actually,
so I'm do that.

109
00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:08.295
And then these icons actually take
their own props to make them bigger.

110
00:07:08.295 --> 00:07:13.199
So, I'm gonna change the font size
of this to be about 30 pixels,

111
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.707
at least maybe bigger, will see.

112
00:07:21.017 --> 00:07:22.576
I'll save this sort of format.

113
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:29.840
The sweet thing about these icon buttons
from chakra-ui is that you can do a color

114
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.347
scheme.

115
00:07:30.347 --> 00:07:32.897
So, instead of changing the background
color, you could change the color scheme.

116
00:07:32.897 --> 00:07:37.030
And adjust the background and
the color of the icon is really smart.

117
00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.580
So, I want this color scheme to be green.

118
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.157
So, it'll pick the right greens for

119
00:07:42.157 --> 00:07:46.990
me, I want it to be a size of large
maybe bigger, we'll start there.

120
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:51.626
You can also say is round,
which is really cool.

121
00:07:51.626 --> 00:07:54.817
If you want the icon to be round,
so we're gonna say is round.

122
00:07:54.817 --> 00:07:56.953
And we'll do that, okay?

123
00:07:56.953 --> 00:07:58.852
So, what's this thing freaking out about?

124
00:07:58.852 --> 00:08:00.530
It wants the aria label.

125
00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:07.977
So, I had aria label,
aria-label = ''play''.

126
00:08:07.977 --> 00:08:08.761
There we go.

127
00:08:13.187 --> 00:08:15.305
Cool, so we have that.

128
00:08:15.305 --> 00:08:22.839
Now I can go back look at our stuff, and
we gotta Play button there, Pretty cool.

129
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.462
Let's see what it looks like not on green.

130
00:08:26.778 --> 00:08:28.279
Looks pretty cool.

131
00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:28.975
Nice Play button.

132
00:08:30.915 --> 00:08:35.247
Any questions on that,
on the icon button, laning the stuff out?

133
00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:43.590
Okay, keep it moving.

134
00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:45.921
Now we're gonna move on to the table.

135
00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:48.257
So, we'll use this table components,

136
00:08:48.257 --> 00:08:51.210
not to be confused with
the native table element.

137
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:53.383
So, make sure you're using
the capital letters,

138
00:08:53.383 --> 00:08:56.730
because they're literally named the same
thing as their HTML counterparts.

139
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.471
So, make sure you're using
the capital Ts and the lowercase ts.

140
00:08:59.471 --> 00:09:01.989
Visually it should make a difference,
but I don't think

141
00:09:01.989 --> 00:09:05.980
you'll be able to do the styling like
we do, so make sure you do that.

142
00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.520
For this table,
you can actually add different variations.

143
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.420
So, the variants that I want for this
table is actually called ''unstyled''.

144
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.004
By default they'll use a styled
one that's got stripes and

145
00:09:16.004 --> 00:09:17.950
borders on it that looks gross.

146
00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.282
So, we're not gonna do that,

147
00:09:21.282 --> 00:09:25.592
we're gonna keep it unstyled to make
it look more like a piece of glass.

148
00:09:25.592 --> 00:09:27.082
That's what reminds me of, like,

149
00:09:27.082 --> 00:09:29.629
this legit looks like a piece
of glass on my opinion, right?

150
00:09:29.629 --> 00:09:31.170
I don't know,
that's what I think I wanna see that.

151
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.460
And then we're gonna use Thead like this.

152
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.987
We're gonna add a border bottom to this.

153
00:09:38.987 --> 00:09:44.046
So, this Thead is gonna
be this part here where

154
00:09:44.046 --> 00:09:48.861
the labels are,
at the top for each column.

155
00:09:48.861 --> 00:09:51.307
So, that border is this
border that you see here,

156
00:09:51.307 --> 00:09:53.183
that's why I'm adding this border.

157
00:09:53.183 --> 00:09:57.093
It's literally this
border that you see here.

158
00:09:57.093 --> 00:09:58.797
So, we're gonna add a border bottom.

159
00:10:01.192 --> 00:10:06.664
And that'll be, we'll say, ''1pixel
solid'' and then for the borderColor,

160
00:10:09.449 --> 00:10:14.298
I'm gonna say ''rgba''.

161
00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:17.071
And I wanted it to be
semi-transparent white.

162
00:10:17.071 --> 00:10:24.613
So, rgba would be (255, 255, 255),
which is white, but then 0.2.

163
00:10:24.613 --> 00:10:26.426
So, it's barely there, but there enough.

164
00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:38.318
And then for the table row, for the table
head, we'll do the &lt;Tr&gt; like this and

165
00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:41.748
then for
one row we'll use the &lt;Th&gt; like this.

166
00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:45.832
And that will be the number symbol,
cuz that's what it has here,

167
00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:47.771
the number symbol on the left.

168
00:10:47.771 --> 00:10:51.043
So, what number track it is in
the playlist, so that number symbol.

169
00:10:55.843 --> 00:11:00.647
And then we'll make another one &lt;Th&gt; and
that will be the word title.

170
00:11:00.647 --> 00:11:02.707
So, the name of the song.

171
00:11:02.707 --> 00:11:05.003
And then next one would be date added.

172
00:11:05.003 --> 00:11:06.274
So, when it was added.

173
00:11:06.274 --> 00:11:12.930
And then the next one
would be the clock icon.

174
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:20.060
So, I think that one's like &lt;AiClock,
no, wait, &lt;AiOutlineClockCircle&gt;.

175
00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.228
That is it, okay?

176
00:11:21.228 --> 00:11:23.795
So, we'll do that, and it will save it.

177
00:11:29.996 --> 00:11:35.189
Okay, so we go back and
look at this thing.

178
00:11:35.189 --> 00:11:38.603
Yeah, it's there.

179
00:11:38.603 --> 00:11:41.825
The obvious problem is that it's gray,
so we can't read it.

180
00:11:41.825 --> 00:11:43.397
So obviously, we need to make this white.

181
00:11:43.397 --> 00:11:49.987
So, I'll just come up here at the top and
I'll just say color white.

182
00:11:49.987 --> 00:11:51.365
There we go.

183
00:11:51.365 --> 00:11:52.924
Now we can see it.

184
00:11:52.924 --> 00:11:57.451
It's like the border bottom is not there,

185
00:11:57.451 --> 00:12:00.986
I misspelled solid, I put sold.

186
00:12:00.986 --> 00:12:01.965
There we go.

187
00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:07.162
Cool, looking good.

188
00:12:07.162 --> 00:12:11.317
I feel like we need some more
margin underneath this button.

189
00:12:11.317 --> 00:12:12.350
I feel like it's too close.

190
00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:18.855
So, add some more margin bottom somewhere,
let's see.

191
00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:24.270
I don't have a containing element
between the button and a table.

192
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.660
So, I like to do a margin bottom.

193
00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:28.516
Let's see, where's this thing close?

194
00:12:28.516 --> 00:12:32.391
Okay, so what I need to do is wrap
this button in a box, so I'll do that.

195
00:12:34.592 --> 00:12:36.630
And then I can add a margin
bottom to this box.

196
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.600
I guess I could just add it to the button.

197
00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.390
I just prefer to add it to something
containing the button than

198
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:42.310
the button itself.

199
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.070
We could do 20 pixels there.

200
00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:48.339
There we go.
Maybe more, 30?

201
00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:50.164
Sure.

202
00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:51.020
There we go.

203
00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:51.813
That's a lot better

204
00:12:57.419 --> 00:13:01.941
Check out a different color, make sure
it looks good on different colors.

205
00:13:01.941 --> 00:13:06.517
Surprising like white looks
good on all the colors,

206
00:13:06.517 --> 00:13:10.574
cuz I think by time
the grading gets down here.

207
00:13:10.574 --> 00:13:13.849
It starts to get darker, so
the white actually pops up very nice.

208
00:13:13.849 --> 00:13:15.754
So, that work out pretty good.
