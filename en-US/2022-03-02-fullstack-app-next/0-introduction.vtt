00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.852
Welcome everyone to this course
here at Frontend Masters.

2
00:00:02.852 --> 00:00:04.138
I'm Scott Moss.

3
00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.854
A little bit about me before we get
into the course and what we're doing.

4
00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:09.723
I am a software engineer.

5
00:00:09.723 --> 00:00:12.933
Most recently I was
an engineer at Netflix,

6
00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:15.457
where I worked on the smart TV app.

7
00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:19.694
So if you've ever downloaded
the Netflix app on your TV before,

8
00:00:19.694 --> 00:00:22.842
I contributed some ways
somewhere to that app.

9
00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:27.214
Mostly on the A/B testing stuff,
really cool product and team to work on.

10
00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:32.865
Before that, I was the CEO and co founder
of a dev tool startup called Tipe.

11
00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.575
I did that for about three years.

12
00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.030
And then before that,

13
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.855
I had my own consultancy business where
I worked with companies like Nike,

14
00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:46.139
Bloomberg, Weather Channel, IBM, Google,
Apple to help them with training or

15
00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:50.525
developing or architecture design,
different things like that.

16
00:00:50.525 --> 00:00:53.675
Currently, I'm actually not
writing code full time anymore for

17
00:00:53.675 --> 00:00:55.631
the first time in my professional life.

18
00:00:55.631 --> 00:01:00.328
I'm now actually a full time investor,
where I invest in early stage companies.

19
00:01:00.328 --> 00:01:03.672
So most of the code that I write
is actually kind on my free time.

20
00:01:03.672 --> 00:01:06.137
Other than doing diligence
on some of these startups,

21
00:01:06.137 --> 00:01:08.764
where I'm checking their code and
their technologies and

22
00:01:08.764 --> 00:01:12.105
helping them hire their first engineers
and different things like that.

23
00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.266
Let's get into this course.

24
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:15.186
So this course is something that me and

25
00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:17.468
the team have been talking about for
a while.

26
00:01:17.468 --> 00:01:21.006
And it's going to be a little different
than some of the courses if you watched

27
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:22.321
that I've created before.

28
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:25.185
Whereas in this course,
I really wanted to dive in and

29
00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:28.956
just get hands-on with a project and
just start building something.

30
00:01:28.956 --> 00:01:33.389
So it's not covering just one topic,
it's covering all the things that I think

31
00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:38.298
someone needs to know in order to develop
a full-stack application in today's world.

32
00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.720
So there's a lot of bleeding edge
stuff out there that sounds cool but

33
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.787
it's not ready yet.

34
00:01:42.787 --> 00:01:45.240
And there's a lot of stuff that's
been around for a while but

35
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.403
maybe could be improved on.

36
00:01:46.403 --> 00:01:49.686
So I've done the research,
I've built things over the years, and

37
00:01:49.686 --> 00:01:53.313
this is just all the stuff that I've
realized is one of the best ways to build

38
00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:54.770
a full-stack web app today.

39
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.089
So I'm just gonna be sharing
with you all how I do that.

40
00:01:58.089 --> 00:02:04.560
And to make it interesting I decided to,
hey, let's build a Spotify clone.

41
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.620
Let's build a music app.

42
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.614
So that's the topic of
the technology today,

43
00:02:07.614 --> 00:02:09.465
is we're gonna be building a Spotify app.

44
00:02:09.465 --> 00:02:12.907
I listen to a lot of music, especially
now that everyone's working remotely.

45
00:02:12.907 --> 00:02:14.309
I've always had music playing.

46
00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.674
Even when I'm in a meeting,
I have music playing in my headphones.

47
00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:20.585
That is, just slightly turned down over
the person talking, because it really just

48
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:23.687
gets me through the day,
gets me through all those Zoom meetings.

49
00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:27.816
So I felt like, hey,
why not share some of that passion and

50
00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:30.527
have you all build a music app as well?

51
00:02:30.527 --> 00:02:32.533
If you've never used Spotify before,

52
00:02:32.533 --> 00:02:36.845
it's just a music streaming app where you
can sign up, play some music, stream it,

53
00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:40.217
sometimes you can download them
depending on what plan you have.

54
00:02:40.217 --> 00:02:43.468
And that's basically it, so
we'll be doing something like that.

55
00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:46.385
If you have used Spotify, you know that
there's just tons of features in there.

56
00:02:46.385 --> 00:02:48.369
We will not be building
all of those features.

57
00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:52.384
This is not [LAUGH] gonna be an app that
you can just replace with Spotify, but

58
00:02:52.384 --> 00:02:55.408
it's gonna cover some of
the main ones that make sense.

59
00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:59.571
And it's gonna be a great foundation for
you all to continue building some of those

60
00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:02.787
features if you want to as practice and
to sharpen your skills.

61
00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:05.194
So that is the topic of this course.

62
00:03:05.194 --> 00:03:07.998
And right now we're gonna get started.
