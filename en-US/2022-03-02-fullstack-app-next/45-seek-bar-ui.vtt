WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:04.686
So we'll keep moving, we got the buttons,
all that's looking good, now let's

2
00:00:04.686 --> 00:00:09.286
render the seek bar, so we have that seek
bar there it like I said, it won't work.

3
00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:12.863
It won't actually do anything
until we get some state going, so

4
00:00:12.863 --> 00:00:17.119
underneath the center element that we did,
this is where we'll render it.

5
00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.434
We'll make another box here,
I think the color for

6
00:00:20.434 --> 00:00:25.058
this as far as when I say color I'm
talking text for like these numbers,

7
00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:29.244
they're not quite right white,
they're more like a gray ish.

8
00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:33.900
So I'm going to put the color here 600,
so gray dots 600 and

9
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.741
then inside of here, we're going to use
a flex because if you look at the SeekBar,

10
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:42.047
we basically have three items.

11
00:00:42.047 --> 00:00:44.957
So we have the current runtime,
the SeekBar itself and

12
00:00:44.957 --> 00:00:47.928
then the overall duration,
so that that'll be a flex,

13
00:00:47.928 --> 00:00:50.725
will this flex over those,
so I'm gonna add a flex.

14
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:02.371
And then I just wanna make sure that
everything is centered like it should be,

15
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:05.295
so I'm gonna add justify center here and

16
00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:10.457
align center which will vertically
center it as well, so we got those.

17
00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:14.272
The next section is going to be
the runtime that number for the runtime so

18
00:01:14.272 --> 00:01:17.006
we want to be able to position
that independently so

19
00:01:17.006 --> 00:01:20.203
we'll wrap it in a box even
though it's just gonna be text.

20
00:01:23.433 --> 00:01:27.185
And then within that box,
like I said it's just gonna be text, but

21
00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.737
I always wrap it in a box so
we can position it.

22
00:01:29.737 --> 00:01:35.072
I wanna add margin to a text
element like a paragraph or

23
00:01:35.072 --> 00:01:40.302
other added to the div that
contains the paragraph.

24
00:01:40.302 --> 00:01:44.467
Or imagine adding padding to, it would
totally affect the way that text looked,

25
00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.438
so you want to add it to its container.

26
00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:51.302
So we'll do that and then now we kind of
got to think about the different widths of

27
00:01:51.302 --> 00:01:53.633
these columns in the flex container.

28
00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:58.217
So if we go back and look, the SeekBar
literally takes up like at least 80% of

29
00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:02.870
this whole row, so I'm just going to
make these two numbers like 10% each and

30
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.966
then the SeekBar will take up 80.

31
00:02:04.966 --> 00:02:08.552
So we'll get this box and
with a 10% like so and then for

32
00:02:08.552 --> 00:02:13.185
the text, we just hard coded number
right quick, so I'll just put like,

33
00:02:13.185 --> 00:02:17.764
we're currently at one minute and
21 seconds, something like that.

34
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.759
Font size, I think this one's probably
gonna look good extra small, so

35
00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:26.859
we'll do that.

36
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:36.707
So if we go back and look,
here we go, I got our 121,

37
00:02:36.707 --> 00:02:40.252
it's gonna be centered because
nothing else is coming after it and

38
00:02:40.252 --> 00:02:43.187
I put justify center so
it's gonna stay at the center.

39
00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:47.031
As soon as we add in the range next that's
gonna 80% you'll see this thing slide over

40
00:02:47.031 --> 00:02:47.621
to the left.

41
00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:56.426
So let's do that, so the next column is
going to be the range so we'll also add

42
00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:01.036
a box to add some container to that and
this is gonna have a width of 80%.

43
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.648
And then we'll use the range
slider component that we imported,

44
00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:13.195
if you did not import already,
it's chakra UI, so

45
00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:17.587
here's the range slider, and
this thing takes a lot of props.

46
00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:21.445
It also takes a child so
we'll put some stuff in between it,

47
00:03:21.445 --> 00:03:25.300
as far as the props go,
it's a little weird how it works, so

48
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.415
the first thing is it takes an ARIA label,
wow, what was that?

49
00:03:29.415 --> 00:03:31.559
Alright, label, there we go and

50
00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:36.386
According to the documentation really
wants you to set because I think this

51
00:03:36.386 --> 00:03:40.537
range slider has the ability to
have like multiple thumbs on it.

52
00:03:40.537 --> 00:03:44.469
So it can be it can range on either side
like it can go up and down the left and

53
00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.650
up and down on the right,
we only we don't want to do that.

54
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.302
So we but we still have to set a min max
even though we're only going from left to

55
00:03:52.302 --> 00:03:54.818
right So we'll save min max here on ARIA.

56
00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:59.637
You might get an error saying like
that's not supported and ARIA label,

57
00:03:59.637 --> 00:04:04.226
it probably isn't but range slider
is not a built in element in HTML.

58
00:04:04.226 --> 00:04:07.220
So that error is just not
appropriate range sliders,

59
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.753
obviously doing something with
this ARIA label that it needs.

60
00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:15.941
And then for another one's called step so
how many values do you wanna

61
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:21.942
increase by every time you do a tick
basically, so we wanna increase by 0.1.

62
00:04:26.034 --> 00:04:31.890
And then it's gonna ask for the min, so in
this case, the minutes just got to be zero

63
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.509
because you want to, that's where we start
off at zero and then we want the max.

64
00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.742
The max, once we get the songs and
the durations, we'll do some math and

65
00:04:40.742 --> 00:04:43.922
we'll figure out what the duration is,
we'll put that in there but for

66
00:04:43.922 --> 00:04:45.050
now, just put a number.

67
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.058
You can put whatever number you want,

68
00:04:47.058 --> 00:04:51.512
I'll probably just make it match the We're
gonna have a, no I had a runtime winner,

69
00:04:51.512 --> 00:04:55.425
yeah, just put whatever you want
because we're gonna make that better.

70
00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:57.499
We're gonna make that real and

71
00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:02.843
then everything else is just a bunch of
like on changes and handlers and values,

72
00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:07.976
things that we haven't set up yet
what state I'm also just gonna put it her.

73
00:05:07.976 --> 00:05:12.808
Just in case we need to get a reference
to it, I'm just gonna say, player range,

74
00:05:12.808 --> 00:05:14.741
so we get a nice reference to it.

75
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:18.087
Like I said,
you'll get this error here for

76
00:05:18.087 --> 00:05:23.062
the ARIA label with yes lint saying like,
it must be a string, but

77
00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:28.869
this is fine, this is what it wants,
it wants it all right, so ignore that.

78
00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:33.916
And then like I said,
this component does take children,

79
00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:39.169
so for children,
we're going to do a range slider track, so

80
00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:46.285
this will be the actual just be this the
track that the range actually goes across.

81
00:05:46.285 --> 00:05:50.917
You see it's starting to populate, so
we got that, we're going to get this one

82
00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:54.458
a different background that's
slightly different color.

83
00:05:54.458 --> 00:06:00.905
So this will have a background
of grade 800 like that and

84
00:06:00.905 --> 00:06:07.629
then a child of this is gonna
be the range slider field track.

85
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.716
And this is just a self closing and
it's going to have

86
00:06:16.716 --> 00:06:22.125
a different background of
slightly lighter so gray.600.

87
00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:24.643
So this would be the the darker
one in the background and

88
00:06:24.643 --> 00:06:27.843
this would be the 1onethat's
actually moving when the song plays.

89
00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:33.864
So it's slightly lighter for is,
the track that it runs on is darker,

90
00:06:33.864 --> 00:06:37.142
so if you go back you can kind of see it.

91
00:06:37.142 --> 00:06:39.962
You can see it's filled out the way
it's filled out on mine because of

92
00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:41.176
the fake values that I put in,

93
00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:43.862
if you put a different values you
might see something different.

94
00:06:47.638 --> 00:06:49.634
Like I said the track
is the darker one and

95
00:06:49.634 --> 00:06:52.287
then the one the child of
that is the lighter one here.

96
00:06:56.848 --> 00:07:01.870
Okay, now we got to add the thumb which
honestly is like, invisible but I think

97
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:07.064
we have to add it anyway, otherwise we
can't do like the clicking and dragging.

98
00:07:07.064 --> 00:07:11.571
So Spotify is designed, it really isn't
like a thumb that you can grab but I was

99
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:16.168
not able to get this work, I was not able
to get this to work without adding this.

100
00:07:16.168 --> 00:07:21.160
So even though we won't see it, it still
has to be there, so we'll do a range

101
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.322
slider thumb like this, it's self closing
and we just need to say index zero.

102
00:07:26.322 --> 00:07:30.154
And the reason Apple index zero is because
like I said, this component supports

103
00:07:30.154 --> 00:07:33.885
multiple thumbs, you can have like,
a bunch of thumbs on this range slider.

104
00:07:33.885 --> 00:07:37.138
So it's saying where on the range
do you want this stuff to exist,

105
00:07:37.138 --> 00:07:40.705
there's only one so we're gonna put
zero we wanted to be the first one.

106
00:07:40.705 --> 00:07:45.100
But you can add like I can
make more if I want and

107
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.958
put put them somewhere else but
we're not going to

108
00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:54.943
do that okay, so
you can see the thumbnails there.

109
00:07:54.943 --> 00:07:59.273
The moves, that's good to go,
we're almost done with the UI part,

110
00:07:59.273 --> 00:08:01.961
we've got to add
the duration on the end and

111
00:08:01.961 --> 00:08:06.455
then I'll push this up because
the duration is actually quite simple.

112
00:08:06.455 --> 00:08:10.192
So the duration is just going to
be the box, right after this box

113
00:08:10.192 --> 00:08:15.001
before the flex closes, it's the last
column, so we'll add another box here.

114
00:08:17.668 --> 00:08:23.250
It will be a width of 10% just
like the runtime before it and

115
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:30.035
just like the runtime is just gonna be
a text with the font of extra small and

116
00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:34.096
it's gonna say what the current duration.

117
00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:38.421
So I'm just gonna put a number here
because obviously we've got to fill that

118
00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:42.152
out with a real value soon and
we do want to add one more thing here.

119
00:08:42.152 --> 00:08:47.188
We will do a text align, right because
we don't do that it'll be we want to

120
00:08:47.188 --> 00:08:52.249
push over to the right, so we want to
be to the right side of its container.

121
00:08:52.249 --> 00:08:53.863
Whereas by default,

122
00:08:53.863 --> 00:08:59.069
everything starts at the left side
it just won't look appropriate,

123
00:08:59.069 --> 00:09:04.020
so there we go, font size, sorry,
likewise it looks a bit cool.
