WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.224
So the first thing is, I wanna talk about
dependencies like what you're gonna

2
00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:04.950
actually need to do this course.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.859
I wanted to make this course
like the barrier to entry,

4
00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.642
to get in this course I wanted
to be really low because

5
00:00:10.642 --> 00:00:14.640
I mean everyone has different machines and
different versions of things.

6
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.523
So I was like, I really want someone to be
able to just like open up a Web IDE and

7
00:00:18.523 --> 00:00:20.300
start developing on this course.

8
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.925
So, really the only thing that you need is
node as long as you have node version 12.

9
00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.777
I think you should be good.

10
00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:32.069
I would recommend getting the latest one
because I will be using ESX modules which

11
00:00:32.069 --> 00:00:33.845
are supported in the latest one.

12
00:00:33.845 --> 00:00:37.520
So you can do that but if not,
I think anything over 12 should be fine.

13
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.822
You shouldn't need anything else
to download on your machine.

14
00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:42.743
So if you're on Windows,
make sure you got node if you're on Mac,

15
00:00:42.743 --> 00:00:46.187
make sure you got node, if you're using
CodeSandbox, you should also be good

16
00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:49.761
as long as you're using a latest version
of node there, so should be good there.

17
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:51.887
There's a lot of things
that we'll be using,

18
00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:53.806
I can list some of those things right now.

19
00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:58.769
So we'll be using Reacts,
Postgres, something called Prisma,

20
00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:01.521
which kinda sits on top of Postgres.

21
00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:04.125
We'll be using next JS
which sits on top of React,

22
00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.428
we'll be using some component libraries.

23
00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:10.289
We'll be using verse cell for
hosting Heroku for

24
00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.688
our databases, I'm sure there's more.

25
00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:17.757
There's a lot of dependence like
modules and things that we'll be using.

26
00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:22.441
But when it comes to Postgres, you do
not need it installed on your computer,

27
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:25.700
as we'll be using a local
Postgres hosted on Heroku.

28
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.520
So if you do have it installed,
that's fine.

29
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.820
Use your local installed ULO.

30
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.370
But for people who don't have it
installed or don't wanna deal with it.

31
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.995
I'm not gonna be doing that, we'll be
using a database hosted on Heroku for

32
00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.990
free, where we can use for development.

33
00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.889
So really the only thing you need
installed as a text editor and

34
00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:43.119
no that's it,
you don't need anything else or

35
00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.212
if you're in the browser like CodeSandbox,
you need a browser installed that's it.

36
00:01:47.212 --> 00:01:49.202
This link is gonna be notes for you all.

37
00:01:49.202 --> 00:01:52.517
Because they're gonna be some things
in here that I want you to copy and

38
00:01:52.517 --> 00:01:56.278
paste not really a lot, mostly just like
config files and stuff, so we can kinda

39
00:01:56.278 --> 00:02:00.600
get going and some of the the design
assets that we'll be using in this course.

40
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.509
So I have a link to a notion document
that I made public ,first thing is I was

41
00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.020
gonna walk you through kinda the app
that you will be working on.

42
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.130
Again, there are tons of features here.

43
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.020
And we could sit here for the next
10 days and really build this out.

44
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.940
So really depends on where we end up.

45
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.232
But there are some things that
I definitely wanna cover and

46
00:02:19.232 --> 00:02:22.600
there's some things that I'll probably
leave up to you as like follow on.

47
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.400
But at the end of the day,
this is an app that can play music.

48
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.800
So if you look at what we have here.

49
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.340
This is the finished version of it.

50
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.206
I'm calling it Tracks,
that's the name of this app.

51
00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:36.969
As you can see here, it kinda looks like
Spotify, you've ever seen it before,

52
00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:39.945
you can take a look at some of
the design assets that I have here or

53
00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:41.598
where I got the inspiration from.

54
00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:44.505
These are literally screenshots
from Spotify from my account.

55
00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:49.110
So you can see the music that I listen to
and this is what we're gonna be making.

56
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.112
So over here on the left,
we got our navigation and

57
00:02:51.112 --> 00:02:52.790
then we got some playlists at the bottom.

58
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.863
And then once you are on a playlist, like
for instance, I'm gonna play this one,

59
00:02:56.863 --> 00:02:59.991
you can click the play button or
you can click one of the songs and

60
00:02:59.991 --> 00:03:02.300
it will actually play the song.

61
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.673
So this is copyright free, royalty free
music, so totally fine to play this,

62
00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:10.981
took me a long time to find some of the
music and actually see the database to get

63
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:14.780
a lot of this stuff, so
super thankful that I was able to do that.

64
00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.150
Yeah, and that's pretty much it.

65
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.842
You can switch playlists here and

66
00:03:17.842 --> 00:03:22.133
you'll see that it'll change colors in the
playlists, you can click on a song, and

67
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:24.991
it'll play it,
that was already playing that's why.

68
00:03:24.991 --> 00:03:29.400
And you can pause it, you can go next,
you have like repeat, you have shuffle.

69
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.907
So a lot of different things
in here that's going on and

70
00:03:32.907 --> 00:03:35.030
we'll be making all of this.

71
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.440
So again, this is gonna be from scratch,
so there is no repo to fork or download.

72
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.980
We're gonna do all of
this stuff from nothing.

73
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.589
So I think that's the exciting part and
that's where I said is slightly different

74
00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:48.407
from the courses that I normally do, where
there's normally like some assets already

75
00:03:48.407 --> 00:03:50.679
there, some things you gotta fork and
start with.

76
00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:52.520
I really wanted to like, what is it like?

77
00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.125
A lot of people always ask, well,
how do you actually get started?

78
00:03:55.125 --> 00:03:58.766
I remember coming out
of boot camp in 2013.

79
00:03:58.766 --> 00:04:00.734
That was like one of
the biggest things for me is,

80
00:04:00.734 --> 00:04:02.280
how do I get started doing something?

81
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.380
I feel like I can contribute, but
I don't really know how to start.

82
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.663
So I wanted this course to
emphasize on starting and

83
00:04:07.663 --> 00:04:09.740
kinda walk you through
how I think about that.
