1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.172
Definitely we wanna pick up where
we left off, which was with these,

2
00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:04.620
sidebar component.

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.285
We initially got our first set
of menus at the top there,

4
00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:10.688
with our icons looking nice,
matching our designs, our designers and

5
00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:13.660
our product managers would be
proud of us for this first pass.

6
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.237
Next what we wanna do if we follow that
design is we wanna get this second group

7
00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.996
of icons here,
followed by this divider, and

8
00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:25.070
then followed by this
scrolling list of playlist.

9
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.940
So, let's continue on and
make that happen.

10
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.284
So let's go over to our code,
And where did we leave off?

11
00:00:33.284 --> 00:00:35.944
So we left off right here with this menu,

12
00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:39.690
this list inside of this box
that had a margin bottom.

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.471
This was the first group of menus,
it was iterating over this menu array.

14
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:46.890
We're gonna do the same thing.

15
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.968
With the next group of menus,
we're gonna make another array, and

16
00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:53.316
we're just gonna iterate over that and
just put it right underneath, and

17
00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:55.700
it'll be pretty similar,
just a space in between.

18
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:56.660
So let's do that.

19
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.206
So we'll make another one here,
I gonna call this one the, I don't know,

20
00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:05.032
music menu, since it's just two
things talking about music,

21
00:01:05.032 --> 00:01:07.070
create playlist and like songs.

22
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.566
So we'll do that, so
music menu equals an array.

23
00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.160
And it's pretty much the same thing,
right?

24
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.700
So we're gonna take one of these,
copy that, bring that here.

25
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.366
And this one is called Create Playlists.

26
00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:30.120
And the one we want for this,
the icon is gonna be MdPlaylistAdd.

27
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.336
There we go, oops PlaylistAdd.

28
00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:40.548
Right now we're gonna say, let's just make
this go home, cuz really this is gonna do

29
00:01:40.548 --> 00:01:45.180
something, it's not gonna route anywhere,
it's actually gonna do something.

30
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.770
So we can figure that part out
later when we get to that.

31
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.802
And then for this next one, this one's
gonna be, I think it was favorites.

32
00:01:53.802 --> 00:02:00.873
So favorites, and this one's gonna
be MdFavorite and /favorites.

33
00:02:02.861 --> 00:02:04.660
There we go.

34
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.416
Scroll down to where we left off.

35
00:02:06.416 --> 00:02:09.850
I write off this box that I have
here with a 20 pixel margin bottom.

36
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.127
So I'm just gonna collapse that,
get it out of the way.

37
00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:15.740
And I'm going to make a new box,
that's gonna go right after it, and

38
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.000
it's pretty much gonna be the same thing.

39
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.870
So I'm gonna say box right here.

40
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.177
I'm gonna make a list just like
we did before with some spacing,

41
00:02:26.177 --> 00:02:32.781
same thing with two, spacing and then we
are gonna iterate over the music menu.

42
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:37.040
And we will just say item, like that, and

43
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:43.260
then gonna do a list item,
just like we did before, like so.

44
00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:47.387
And then for that list item,

45
00:02:47.387 --> 00:02:52.468
we're gonna do some padding of 20 pixels,
oops 20 pixels.

46
00:02:52.468 --> 00:02:56.063
And then we're gonna do a font size of,
let's see,

47
00:02:56.063 --> 00:03:00.231
let's do something 16 pixels
I think as we had before, and

48
00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:04.089
then the key is also gonna be the name,
that's unique.

49
00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:08.055
And then once we're inside that list item,

50
00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:12.460
we need to add the icon and
the navigation links.

51
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.040
So we can actually just
pretty much copy this.

52
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.060
I'm gonna take this link box, all the way
down to this box, just gonna copy that.

53
00:03:21.362 --> 00:03:26.153
Gonna go down here, gonna paste it.

54
00:03:26.153 --> 00:03:30.430
Actually I'm just gonna change this
from item to menu so it's just the same.

55
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.554
So let me make that menu, and
then this will be menu.name.

56
00:03:36.436 --> 00:03:39.295
There we go.
Everything just kind of works.

57
00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:41.075
So we're kind of there.

58
00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.670
It looks like there's just too much
space in between these menu items.

59
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.859
So we gotta come back and fix that,

60
00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.875
obviously there shouldn't
be that much space.

61
00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:52.689
So we'll fix that and
I believe that is because I have 20

62
00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.501
pixels of padding on a list item,
should be padding x, so

63
00:03:57.501 --> 00:04:02.140
I want padding left and right,
and not top and bottom.

64
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.610
So that should fix that and
there we go, that fixes that.

65
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.430
So we are good there.

66
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.640
And then other thing is, I think we
needed a divider in between these two.

67
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.118
So I'm actually gonna add a divider
in between these two boxes here,

68
00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:21.640
And hopefully that'll give
us some nice space there.

69
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.040
So let's see if that actually did it.

70
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.087
So, yeah, there we go,
we got a divider there.

71
00:04:26.087 --> 00:04:27.270
Looks pretty cool.

72
00:04:29.827 --> 00:04:34.214
But now looks like we need some
space above this menu that's

73
00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:38.862
equidistant to the space below
this menu which I believe is, so

74
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:45.192
this 20 pixels margin bottom, so that
means this one needs 20 pixels margin top.

75
00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:52.107
Or I could just put margin y on the
divider, which would probably be easier,

76
00:04:52.107 --> 00:04:53.733
but we're already here.

77
00:04:53.733 --> 00:04:59.391
So, There we go.

78
00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:02.413
Now we're equidistant there.

79
00:05:02.413 --> 00:05:06.765
And I think the divider
is a little too bright.

80
00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:10.328
We could probably not make it that color.

81
00:05:10.328 --> 00:05:16.162
I'm gonna guess and see that if we change
the background color that might be it.

82
00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:19.442
And it's really cool, so we're gonna
actually use the colors that we have in

83
00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:21.770
our theme, so I can see like gray.,
and then a value.

84
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.896
You can see I'm getting this autocomplete.

85
00:05:22.896 --> 00:05:27.836
So those colors that we filled in with 100
always a 900 I can do that, so I can say

86
00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:35.330
gray.900 I don't think the background
is that, maybe it's color, let's see.

87
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:36.180
Yeah, it was color.

88
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.244
Okay, so gray at 900 is too dark,
let's try 700.

89
00:05:40.244 --> 00:05:41.990
Still too light, let's do 800.

90
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.200
That's probably right.

91
00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:50.020
So there we go, we got our two lists,
we got our icons, we got our divider.

92
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.320
Looks somewhat appropriate.

93
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.311
And most of it was really just
bringing the copy and paste over.

94
00:05:57.311 --> 00:06:01.574
And because I did that twice, ideally
what I would do is I would probably

95
00:06:01.574 --> 00:06:05.281
take everything inside this list item,
so everything here.

96
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:10.450
And I would make another component
called menu item or something like that.

97
00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.082
And it would just take in a menu item, and

98
00:06:12.082 --> 00:06:15.353
it would render that cuz I already wrote
twice, that was already too much for me.

99
00:06:15.353 --> 00:06:18.410
Definitely would probably make another
component all that in another file and

100
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.690
bring that in.

101
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.601
But like I said before, I'm not gonna
turn everything into a component for

102
00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:27.324
the sake of the course, but I will
describe to you when I would do it, and

103
00:06:27.324 --> 00:06:30.205
this is definitely one of
the cases where I would do it.

104
00:06:30.205 --> 00:06:34.366
Typically I would set up an ES lint
rule where you couldn't even have

105
00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:39.330
a component that have more than 50 lines
of code, because that's how crazy I am

106
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.934
about components as being too big,
just break them down as much as you can.

107
00:06:43.934 --> 00:06:47.654
And then now people can just develop
a lot faster, but at the same time,

108
00:06:47.654 --> 00:06:51.870
I think it's just over developing if you
have for every single thing on your app,

109
00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.112
there's a component.

110
00:06:53.112 --> 00:06:56.672
It's, okay, well,
when do you stop doing that?

111
00:06:56.672 --> 00:06:58.362
So there's a fine line.

112
00:06:58.362 --> 00:07:01.756
I think you just got to do it a long time
to figure out what works for you and

113
00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:02.512
your team.

114
00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:08.690
But typically, I usually shoot for
more components versus big components.

115
00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.821
Cuz what I find out is when
you have bigger components,

116
00:07:11.821 --> 00:07:16.534
people are touching the same files, you
have a higher chance of merge conflicts.

117
00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:21.125
Cuz it's like you got less files, they're
bigger, more people are touching them,

118
00:07:21.125 --> 00:07:23.696
there's a higher chance for
merge conflicts.

119
00:07:23.696 --> 00:07:25.345
And we all don't want to
deal with merge conflicts.

120
00:07:25.345 --> 00:07:28.245
So yeah, more files, less merge conflicts.

121
00:07:28.245 --> 00:07:32.016
But not too many files where it's
just like, yeah, what is this?

122
00:07:32.016 --> 00:07:32.932
This is too many files.

123
00:07:32.932 --> 00:07:35.176
So, yeah, it's a balancing act.

124
00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:38.550
Actually not I'm thinking about it,
I think the divider goes after this.

125
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:40.400
I think I put it in between the two menus.

126
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.960
I think it goes after this menu.

127
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.170
So I'm gonna move it down.

128
00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.826
I'll take this really cool
divider that we made,

129
00:07:47.826 --> 00:07:52.190
and I will put it after this box,
cuz that's where it goes.

130
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.788
It goes in between the menus and the
playlist and not in between the two menus.

131
00:07:55.788 --> 00:08:01.130
So, I don't wanna get our designers
to be mad about that small facts.

132
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.624
So gotta move it down now.

133
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:08.521
There we go.

134
00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:11.545
And then what's next is we
need to make the list for

135
00:08:11.545 --> 00:08:16.370
the playlist which again is also very
similar, except it doesn't have icons.

136
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.880
So what we're gonna do there is
we're gonna give this a box.

137
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.294
But because this container has to scroll
because you might have, I don't know,

138
00:08:25.294 --> 00:08:26.924
infinite amount of playlist.

139
00:08:26.924 --> 00:08:28.703
And we don't want
the whole page to scroll,

140
00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:32.480
we don't want the whole sidebar to scroll,
we only want this section.

141
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.890
When I say this section I'm talking about
from this divider down to the bottom.

142
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.070
We only want this part to scroll.

143
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:41.120
The only way to do that in
CSS is to give it a height.

144
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.288
You have to have a known
height in order to scroll,

145
00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:45.726
cuz otherwise how does it
know when it's overflowing?

146
00:08:45.726 --> 00:08:47.650
So you have to give it a height.

147
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.410
But how do we know how tall this is?

148
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.531
This goes back to why I made this
absolutely physician and gave it a fixed

149
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:57.980
height, because now I can just do math
to try to figure out how tall this is.

150
00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:03.051
So what I'm gonna do is, there's a lot of
ways you can do it, but I think because

151
00:09:03.051 --> 00:09:08.051
the way that these items are positioned,
we can actually kind of just give this

152
00:09:08.051 --> 00:09:13.250
whatever height we want and it'll just
fill out the rest based off a percentage.

153
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.227
So I'm just gonna say heights,
and I don't know,

154
00:09:17.227 --> 00:09:21.399
let's try 66%,
we'll see what that looks like.

155
00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:24.458
And you'll see why I'm saying we can
kind of do whatever we want here.

156
00:09:24.458 --> 00:09:28.518
So and then overflow y, we're gonna
put auto, that's gonna make it scroll.

157
00:09:28.518 --> 00:09:31.879
If you put scroll,
scroll bar will always be there.

158
00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:34.800
If you put auto it'll disappear
when you're not scrolling and

159
00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.297
show up when you are scrolling.

160
00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:39.955
You can also change the design of the
scroll bar to make it look exactly like

161
00:09:39.955 --> 00:09:44.090
that design, but we're not gonna get into
changing scroll bar designs right now.

162
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:51.071
PaddingY, so that's top and
bottom, we're gonna put 20 pixels.

163
00:09:51.071 --> 00:09:53.150
And then I'm just gonna say hello.

164
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.540
So we can see what that looks like.

165
00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:02.310
And actually what I'm gonna do is,
I'm just gonna do

166
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:07.300
a quick iteration here just to
see how this thing scrolls.

167
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.693
So I'm gonna make a new, Array.

168
00:10:12.693 --> 00:10:13.764
And you don't have to do this part.

169
00:10:13.764 --> 00:10:16.389
This is just me trying to add
some things to it right quick,

170
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:17.847
just to see if the scroll works.

171
00:10:17.847 --> 00:10:24.271
50 things, we just fill with a number
that map over those things, and

172
00:10:24.271 --> 00:10:29.854
I'm just going to render
a component an h1 that says higher.

173
00:10:29.854 --> 00:10:33.679
So I got 50 things in here,
I'm just gonna map over them and

174
00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.555
see what that looks like.

175
00:10:35.555 --> 00:10:36.446
Here we go.

176
00:10:36.446 --> 00:10:40.375
As you can see,
it's not doing what we intended to do.

177
00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:44.195
It's literally going off of the page and
it's scrolling the whole page, right?

178
00:10:44.195 --> 00:10:47.295
So that's not how we want this to work.

179
00:10:47.295 --> 00:10:50.170
So we need to actually fix this.

180
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:54.811
Basically, the issue was this content box,

181
00:10:54.811 --> 00:10:58.240
it was not filling up its parent.

182
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.470
It was like going past it.

183
00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:03.615
So I need to give this
a height of 100% as well.

184
00:11:03.615 --> 00:11:08.450
And I think that might resolve
the whole relative issue.

185
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:11.130
So we could try that,
and yeah, there we go.

186
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.007
So now it's scrolling, and again that
was because I didn't set the inner box,

187
00:11:18.007 --> 00:11:22.670
the content box to be of height
of the container which is 100%.

188
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:27.252
So it needs to be 100% of
its container which is

189
00:11:27.252 --> 00:11:32.062
being loaded inside
the player layout to be 100vh

190
00:11:33.774 --> 00:11:36.522
Or, yeah 100vh, yeah.

191
00:11:36.522 --> 00:11:43.094
Minus the 100 pixels from
the top bar right here.

192
00:11:48.564 --> 00:11:53.556
Okay, so now that we got our scrolling,
I can get rid of this mock content and

193
00:11:53.556 --> 00:11:56.057
we can actually put in our list stuff.

194
00:11:56.057 --> 00:11:59.661
So I'm just gonna make up a playlist
right quick with some data,

195
00:11:59.661 --> 00:12:04.494
we'll fill this out later when we get some
real data in, so I'm gonna say playlists.

196
00:12:07.005 --> 00:12:08.590
And for now, this will be a string.

197
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:10.205
Let's just have a string.

198
00:12:10.205 --> 00:12:15.593
And I'll just say new array,
and I'll do like 30

199
00:12:15.593 --> 00:12:21.110
playlists .fill with
literally anything .map and

200
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:24.636
I'm just gonna return the word,

201
00:12:28.003 --> 00:12:32.963
We'll just return a string that says

202
00:12:32.963 --> 00:12:37.925
Playlist and then the number i+1.

203
00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.448
So we got our playlist here,

204
00:12:39.448 --> 00:12:43.586
which is just an array of 30 strings
that say playlist followed by a number.

205
00:12:45.423 --> 00:12:49.702
This is just a quick way to make an array,
new array, how many things you wanted it,

206
00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.840
you got to put fill because if you don't,

207
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.738
the array will just have 30
undefined things in them.

208
00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:56.160
And then you can't really
do anything with that.

209
00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.238
So I'll just fill it with anything,
loop over that with a map and

210
00:12:59.238 --> 00:13:00.327
return some strings.

211
00:13:01.507 --> 00:13:07.530
So now that we have that, we can go back
to our box at the bottom, we can fix this.

212
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.418
So the next thing we wanna do is just
like before, we're gonna make a list,

213
00:13:11.418 --> 00:13:13.780
do some spacing of two,
keep it consistent.

214
00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:18.464
Once we get that,
got a map of our playlist,

215
00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.151
And then for each one of these,

216
00:13:25.151 --> 00:13:30.015
we're going to make a list item just
like we did with all the things.

217
00:13:30.015 --> 00:13:33.484
And then for the list item let's
add some paddingX, so left and

218
00:13:33.484 --> 00:13:36.760
right of 20 pixels just like
we did with all of them.

219
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:42.407
And then we'll make a key which
will just be the playlist itself,

220
00:13:42.407 --> 00:13:44.880
cuz this is a string for now.

221
00:13:47.742 --> 00:13:53.051
And then we'll do the whole thing for
the link box and the linking.

222
00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:57.939
So we'll say link box just like that, And

223
00:13:57.939 --> 00:14:03.270
then we'll add a link just like that,
which actually I think is called NextLink.

224
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:04.440
That's how I imported it.

225
00:14:07.168 --> 00:14:09.027
And I'll save it,
right click so I can clean up.

226
00:14:09.027 --> 00:14:11.270
There we go.

227
00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.380
And then the next string
is gonna have an href.

228
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.589
For now we're just gonna go home cuz
you don't have that page set up, and

229
00:14:17.589 --> 00:14:20.775
then inside of here we'll
do the actual link overlay.

230
00:14:26.293 --> 00:14:32.042
Like so, And then inside the link overlay,

231
00:14:32.042 --> 00:14:36.825
we can just put the playlists like that.

232
00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:38.425
And I'll just say passHref.

233
00:14:39.865 --> 00:14:41.445
Everything's looking good here.

234
00:14:41.445 --> 00:14:43.065
All the links are working fine.

235
00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:45.532
You can see everyone is
linking back to the homepage.

236
00:14:47.237 --> 00:14:49.020
The scrolling is working just fine.

237
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.627
Nothing else is moving.

238
00:14:50.627 --> 00:14:54.907
Looks like it's pretty good to go, if this
was an isolated component I would say it's

239
00:14:54.907 --> 00:14:58.773
pretty good, pretty close to what we need,
everything lines up to the left,

240
00:14:58.773 --> 00:15:01.020
this part is important.

241
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.557
Every time, I don't know, I guess I'm
kind of a stickler of things lining up to

242
00:15:05.557 --> 00:15:09.784
the left, but I always like to make
sure all the things line up to the left.

243
00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:13.164
And that's how you know if you got
your padding or whatever wrong.

244
00:15:13.164 --> 00:15:17.952
This is why it's important to wrap your
content in a div because I can just

245
00:15:17.952 --> 00:15:22.996
give that div a paddingX in this case
like we did versus each individual one.

246
00:15:22.996 --> 00:15:27.412
So yeah, it's important to do that,
but remember if you do do that,

247
00:15:27.412 --> 00:15:32.438
if you have own hover highlight because
you're padding on individual thing,

248
00:15:32.438 --> 00:15:35.580
it won't show the padding for
the whole row.

249
00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:39.372
So, there's pros and
cons about how you need to do that.
