WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.730
So cool, we got the next image.

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.970
Now what we wanna do,
let's look at our design here.

3
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.220
And we wanna get these initial
navigations done with our icon.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.620
So this is where the list
thing is gonna come in.

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
And this is where I said, yeah, we do
need to hard code this data but not so

6
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.129
much in the JSX.

7
00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.283
Because I don't wanna write,
a list item and a list icon and

8
00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:23.449
then some text times, in,
right, I don't wanna do that.

9
00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.663
So instead I'm gonna just
make some data up here,

10
00:00:26.663 --> 00:00:30.960
where I'm gonna put the menus and
then we can map over these menus.

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.261
And just write one component
I don't like doing all that.

12
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:37.770
So we're gonna say const nav menu.

13
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.590
And this is gonna be in an array.

14
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.678
So if we kinda look at this,
it looks we need an icon we need

15
00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:49.989
I don't know a name or text or
label or something like that.

16
00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.979
And then what route you wanna
go to when you click on it so

17
00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:55.270
that's what an app menu item looks like.

18
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.920
So in this case I'm gonna
say name is gonna be,

19
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.899
home icon is gonna be the end home,
one that we import a top.

20
00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.235
And then I'm gonna say routes.

21
00:01:08.235 --> 00:01:11.060
When you click on this, well,
it should just go home.

22
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.579
So I'm gonna do that.

23
00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.259
I'm gonna copy this, and I'm gonna do
the same thing for what is it called?

24
00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:18.749
Search.

25
00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:23.029
So search, and this one is Md search and

26
00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:26.929
this one should go to slash search.

27
00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.759
Same thing for
the last one this one's called library or

28
00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.395
is it my library your library
excuse me your library.

29
00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:39.685
And this one I think this
one's gonna be the MD music.

30
00:01:39.685 --> 00:01:40.825
Which one is this?

31
00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:44.286
I imported it in the music library.

32
00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:50.320
So that's so specific, [LAUGH] why
does material design have that?

33
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.315
I don't know.

34
00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:55.176
And it was called this route library.

35
00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:55.841
So cool.

36
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:57.826
We have our Nav menu.

37
00:01:57.826 --> 00:02:00.156
And we'll just enumerate over that now.

38
00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:05.049
So, outside of this box where
we have our image we're

39
00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.526
just gonna make a another
box right here inside.

40
00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:12.438
So this is the content box
this is the image box and

41
00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:16.286
then underneath the image box but
still within the content box.

42
00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:19.126
We wanna make another box for this menu.

43
00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:27.393
There we go and then we'll just add
some margin bottom to this one and

44
00:02:27.393 --> 00:02:28.476
I'll tell you why.

45
00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:32.940
So margin bottom kinda just won't play
around this number again I'm just

46
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.665
gonna put.

47
00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:37.649
I don't know 20 pixels we'll see what
looks good the reason I'm doing that is

48
00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:38.846
because if you look at.

49
00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:43.743
This list that has three navigation
items in it there's a space and

50
00:02:43.743 --> 00:02:45.585
then there's two more.

51
00:02:45.585 --> 00:02:47.986
So that margin bottom has to account for
that space there.

52
00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:49.986
That's what it's two groups of menu items.

53
00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:52.066
I guess you could just put
them next to each other.

54
00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:55.607
But then again, your designer works so
hard to put that space there.

55
00:02:55.607 --> 00:02:56.936
You should do it too.

56
00:02:56.936 --> 00:02:59.356
Just you wanna make
a designer's look good.

57
00:02:59.356 --> 00:03:02.326
So, make sure you have that space.

58
00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:06.176
Okay, so now that we got that,
I'm gonna add a list.

59
00:03:06.176 --> 00:03:08.596
Company component like that.

60
00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:11.216
It's really cool because
it takes this spacing prop.

61
00:03:11.216 --> 00:03:15.466
That tells you how much space you
want in between each list item, and

62
00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:16.816
it's just a number.

63
00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:19.187
I'm just gonna put two cuz that's
the one that worked for me.

64
00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:20.445
So I'm just gonna put two here.

65
00:03:20.445 --> 00:03:22.000
I think,
who knows what they're multiplying by.

66
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.515
That might be times ten.

67
00:03:23.515 --> 00:03:24.555
So maybe that's 20 pixels.

68
00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:25.995
Or times five and that's ten pixels.

69
00:03:25.995 --> 00:03:29.000
I don't know, but look at the.

70
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.930
Don't go off of that.

71
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.020
So that seems to work pretty good.

72
00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.760
And then now I'm just gonna iterate
over nav menu, so nav menu.map.

73
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.996
I'm gonna get a menu item here.

74
00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:47.180
And then for each one of these,
I'm just gonna ender a list item, right?

75
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.661
So I might do a implicit return,
on multiple lines,

76
00:03:50.661 --> 00:03:53.280
which means I can do parenthesis here.

77
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.363
Followed by squared curly bracket and

78
00:03:55.363 --> 00:03:58.820
then hit enter that way I don't
have to put the return keyword.

79
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.714
That's kinda confusing that's the same
thing as literally putting the curly

80
00:04:03.714 --> 00:04:06.170
brackets and then putting the return.

81
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.343
And then putting these parentheses so
that was a lot more code and

82
00:04:09.343 --> 00:04:10.770
that's why I didn't do it.

83
00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.498
So I'm just gonna go back
to doing a implicit return

84
00:04:14.498 --> 00:04:19.019
what the parentheses because
it's gonna be multiple lines.

85
00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.769
And then brackets actually I don't
need brackets because I'm gonna return

86
00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:23.480
a component.

87
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.020
So, then here I'm just
gonna say let's title.

88
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.061
So, and inside this list item, this is
where we gotta do a bunch of funky stuff.

89
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:36.338
So the first thing is let's
style this list item.

90
00:04:36.338 --> 00:04:38.950
And we're gonna put some padding X on it.

91
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.959
X which again is left and right.

92
00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.616
And again, when it comes to this spacing,

93
00:04:44.616 --> 00:04:46.420
you really just gotta
play around what it's.

94
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.123
So this is gonna be 20 pixels
when change the font size, so

95
00:04:49.123 --> 00:04:50.920
we're gonna bump this up a little bit.

96
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.311
We'll make this 16 pixels.

97
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:56.200
We're kinda hard coding all this stuff.

98
00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.606
And then because we're iterating
over something and reacts,

99
00:05:00.606 --> 00:05:03.690
it prefers if we give
each item a unique key.

100
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.219
So it can track it for
optimization purposes.

101
00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.399
So, what's unique about these menu items?

102
00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:09.460
They all have a different name.

103
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.950
So I could just say,
menu.name as the unique element here.

104
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.410
If this was something from the server, you
put the ID or underscore ID or whatever.

105
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.402
Because each list item is gonna be
clickable, as in it can route somewhere,

106
00:05:24.402 --> 00:05:26.120
we need these to be links.

107
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.629
But I want the whole list item,
to be clickable and not just the text and

108
00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.630
the list item.

109
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.050
So I'm gonna use something called the link
box from Chakra UI that literally does

110
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.770
that for us.

111
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.366
So we'll just use the link box here and

112
00:05:39.366 --> 00:05:44.170
then what we're gonna do is we're
gonna use a component from next AS.

113
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.929
For the actual link, so I'm gonna import.

114
00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:52.910
I'm gonna call this next
link from next link.

115
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.922
And the reason we have to do this versus
a regular anchor tag is because if we use

116
00:05:56.922 --> 00:05:59.530
a regular anchor tag when
someone clicks on this.

117
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.190
It's gonna go to the server make a request
when the server was gonna render from

118
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.809
the server.

119
00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:05.770
And it's not gonna do
client side rendering.

120
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.310
That's not actually what we want.

121
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.566
That would not be a fun app.

122
00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:12.312
I mean,
your music will basically stop playing.

123
00:06:12.312 --> 00:06:16.859
So we want client side rendering
after the initial server render.

124
00:06:16.859 --> 00:06:21.270
So by using the next link,
we're opting into client side rendering.

125
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.650
So inside this link box,
I'm gonna say next link.

126
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.270
So and then it's gonna take a H ref.

127
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.890
In this case, the H reference is
gonna go to wherever the route was.

128
00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.243
So in this case, menu dot route, and

129
00:06:41.243 --> 00:06:47.820
then we've got this
thing called pass H ref.

130
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.960
This just means if you have
an anchor tag inside of an,

131
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.450
if you have a custom component.

132
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.056
Or an anchor tag inside of next
link it's gonna pass the h

133
00:06:59.056 --> 00:07:02.790
ref that you gave it to
its child components.

134
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.209
So it's symantec and
everything works just fine.

135
00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:09.925
And we actually are gonna use
a another custom component that

136
00:07:09.925 --> 00:07:11.690
does require an h ref.

137
00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:16.510
And it's called the link overlay
which comes from chakra UI.

138
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.609
So this pass h ref is gonna take this h
ref and pass it to this link overlay here.

139
00:07:21.609 --> 00:07:23.484
So we don't have to and

140
00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:29.230
then finally inside of this link
overlay I can do another component.

141
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:34.988
Which is gonna be the list icon so
I'm gonna say list icon and

142
00:07:34.988 --> 00:07:38.220
I can use the property called as.

143
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.400
So what icon do you want this to be?

144
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.230
You could put, text in here and opt into
chakra UIs icons that it comes built with.

145
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.430
But we do not want that.

146
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.179
We are gonna use the icons from the ones
that we imported from react icons.

147
00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:55.669
And in this case it is gonna be menu
dot icon, whatever that thing is.

148
00:07:55.669 --> 00:08:00.829
We are gonna make sure that it is
white somerset set color whites.

149
00:08:00.829 --> 00:08:04.726
And then I'm gonna add some
margin rights to it so

150
00:08:04.726 --> 00:08:07.681
it has space between it and the text.

151
00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:13.301
And I'll just be 20 pixels and
actually this is self closing so

152
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:16.539
we don't need anything between it.

153
00:08:16.539 --> 00:08:18.189
And right underneath that.

154
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:21.419
Is this gonna be menu dot name.

155
00:08:27.962 --> 00:08:32.928
And that right there should give
us a somewhat close version

156
00:08:32.928 --> 00:08:35.119
of the menu of the design.

157
00:08:35.119 --> 00:08:40.979
And as you can see, it does look pretty
close to the design, that we have.

158
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:45.095
One thing I've learned about working on
you eyes is that you're just gonna have

159
00:08:45.095 --> 00:08:45.899
a lot of deals.

160
00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:46.680
Right?

161
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.119
We're really, [LAUGH] really good.

162
00:08:48.119 --> 00:08:51.589
You guys actually have a lot of deals
because what I found out is that.

163
00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:54.218
You really wanna get good
at positioning things and

164
00:08:54.218 --> 00:08:55.939
putting them in the right place.

165
00:08:55.939 --> 00:08:58.620
And it's a lot easier when you
have containers around everything.

166
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.960
So actually a lot of the HTML or in this
case, the JSX that you write are just

167
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.120
gonna not serve any purpose
other than to be a target.

168
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.322
To which you can style on to
actually target its child or

169
00:09:09.322 --> 00:09:10.930
its children in this case.

170
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.329
So, I wanna move this group of things.

171
00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:16.297
Well, you got to wrap it in a div
will only remove these two things in

172
00:09:16.297 --> 00:09:16.889
this group.

173
00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:19.054
We got to wrap those
two things in a div and

174
00:09:19.054 --> 00:09:22.129
it's just a lot of that stuff
just being able to control.

175
00:09:22.129 --> 00:09:27.058
Where you position typically
means wrapping whatever

176
00:09:27.058 --> 00:09:29.850
you wanna div seeing do I go in.

177
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:35.156
And do some objects like this,
or do I go in and

178
00:09:35.156 --> 00:09:40.891
just, repeating myself and
writing this code?

179
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:44.639
Me personally, if I have to do it more
than once I'm gonna turn it into data.

180
00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:48.488
And at the same time, if it's someone
other than me working on this project,

181
00:09:48.488 --> 00:09:49.979
I'm gonna turn it into data.

182
00:09:49.979 --> 00:09:53.464
Because now all I have to do,
especially if this this was,

183
00:09:53.464 --> 00:09:55.039
imagine if you had a file.

184
00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:58.968
They just had a file called menus and
it was just all the menus in there.

185
00:09:58.968 --> 00:10:02.098
If someone wants to add a new menu item
all they have to do is just go into that

186
00:10:02.098 --> 00:10:03.069
file add a new object.

187
00:10:03.069 --> 00:10:05.577
They don't need to know where in
the code this has been rendered they

188
00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:07.476
don't know they don't need
to know the solution.

189
00:10:07.476 --> 00:10:08.356
And six other components.

190
00:10:08.356 --> 00:10:10.095
They don't need to know the styling.

191
00:10:10.095 --> 00:10:14.865
They just got, I know it's a favorite
icon I know it's called favorite and

192
00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:17.226
I know it's gonna slash favorites.

193
00:10:17.226 --> 00:10:18.951
So I'm just gonna add that object and
that's it.

194
00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.146
Anyone can do that.

195
00:10:20.146 --> 00:10:21.886
So for me, I would always do that.

196
00:10:21.886 --> 00:10:25.470
And also it kinda makes it really easy
to test because now when you wanna

197
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.146
write test.

198
00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.326
To make sure that all the right
things are on the page.

199
00:10:28.326 --> 00:10:32.642
You don't have to test that each
menu item got put on the page,

200
00:10:32.642 --> 00:10:36.725
you don't have to test that
a menu item got put on the page.

201
00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:39.946
And then you only gotta test that
this has the right items in it.

202
00:10:39.946 --> 00:10:44.003
So it's so much easier to test
an array with objects and then it's,

203
00:10:44.003 --> 00:10:48.216
let me go look in the DOM and query for
ten things it's kinda annoying.

204
00:10:48.216 --> 00:10:52.438
So, yeah, me personally, if yeah,
I would just read it, put it in data.

205
00:10:52.438 --> 00:10:55.576
I mean, that's what react and
most front end frameworks were created.

206
00:10:55.576 --> 00:10:57.716
Is to do this is to be data driven.

207
00:10:57.716 --> 00:11:02.871
Whereas before, we were all driven by,
putting state in the DOM and

208
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:06.589
you had all this big
spaghetti code with J query.

209
00:11:06.589 --> 00:11:09.886
Which people hate on J query is
also pretty dope at the same time.

210
00:11:09.886 --> 00:11:12.446
But anyway, yeah,
that's what this is supposed to do.

211
00:11:12.446 --> 00:11:17.006
So I take advantage of the framework,
it wants you to do this in my opinion.

212
00:11:17.006 --> 00:11:19.155
So, how does next image
optimize performance?

213
00:11:19.155 --> 00:11:25.066
It depends on the type of
image that you import.

214
00:11:25.066 --> 00:11:28.271
So whether it's an SVG,
or PNG or JPEG, but

215
00:11:28.271 --> 00:11:33.916
there's different optimization packages
that people manually do anyway.

216
00:11:33.916 --> 00:11:39.256
If you have web pack, you can use a,
what's that SVG optimizer?

217
00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:40.478
For the name of it.

218
00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:42.976
There's a very popular SVG
optimized that you add to web pack.

219
00:11:42.976 --> 00:11:47.086
And it'll basically trim all
the unnecessary stuff in your SVG file.

220
00:11:47.086 --> 00:11:48.348
It'll get rid of certain things.

221
00:11:48.348 --> 00:11:49.690
It'll try to inline it.

222
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:51.726
So the next image will try to do that.

223
00:11:51.726 --> 00:11:55.884
It will also try to just get rid of
unnecessary if you have like a JPEG or

224
00:11:55.884 --> 00:11:57.258
something like that.

225
00:11:57.258 --> 00:12:01.657
It will try to get rid of the metadata
that's in there that's not associated

226
00:12:01.657 --> 00:12:02.216
with it.

227
00:12:02.216 --> 00:12:05.621
Geo location stuff that might be
associated with an image that you might

228
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:07.556
take on your iPhone, things like that.

229
00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:12.307
And then it also works with
most CMS is because if you use

230
00:12:12.307 --> 00:12:16.866
the image from a CMS it most
of the CMS is allow you to.

231
00:12:16.866 --> 00:12:21.324
Transform the images on the fly through
the CDN by adding things to the query

232
00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:21.906
string.

233
00:12:21.906 --> 00:12:26.826
Next JS supports that
functionality with a plugin.

234
00:12:26.826 --> 00:12:28.386
So it does a lot of that.

235
00:12:28.386 --> 00:12:31.106
I'm sure it does more than just that.

236
00:12:31.106 --> 00:12:34.886
But it's just their version of that a lot
of frameworks have their own image tag.

237
00:12:34.886 --> 00:12:37.866
Gatsby has one that does
something very similar.

238
00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:39.926
You don't have to use it.

239
00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.416
But I recommend you do use it.

240
00:12:42.416 --> 00:12:44.996
It also helps with the responsiveness.

241
00:12:44.996 --> 00:12:48.762
So I think it actually creates different
sizes for you at different resolutions and

242
00:12:48.762 --> 00:12:51.146
things like that if you
pass the appropriate props.

243
00:12:51.146 --> 00:12:54.550
We're not taking advantage of it
fully by just using a HREF and

244
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:57.246
our SVG was already pretty
much cleaned up by me.

245
00:12:57.246 --> 00:12:59.906
So I don't know how much
optimization is doing for our logo.

246
00:12:59.906 --> 00:13:02.605
But yeah,
you should probably use it all the time.

247
00:13:02.605 --> 00:13:04.626
I would recommend it.

248
00:13:04.626 --> 00:13:07.149
But you have to know the width and
the height in order.

249
00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:09.965
So I guess the only time you wanna use is,
I don't know the width and

250
00:13:09.965 --> 00:13:12.096
height I'm gonna change this and
CSS so then you.

251
00:13:12.096 --> 00:13:14.189
I guess you wouldn't use next image but

252
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:16.675
yeah if you knew that
then yeah use next image.

253
00:13:16.675 --> 00:13:21.559
So far this is what it looks like I
mean if we just compare the two this

254
00:13:21.559 --> 00:13:23.055
looks pretty good.

255
00:13:23.055 --> 00:13:27.144
In my opinion it looks looks pretty
good there is a hover effect here.

256
00:13:27.144 --> 00:13:28.524
We can get to that.

257
00:13:28.524 --> 00:13:29.745
Maybe that is not so exciting.

258
00:13:29.745 --> 00:13:30.745
So I don't know.

259
00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:32.465
But it works.

260
00:13:32.465 --> 00:13:36.205
I'm not gonna click anything because it's
gonna break if I go but you can see that.

261
00:13:36.205 --> 00:13:40.296
The if you hover over that the browser
is telling us that they are actually

262
00:13:40.296 --> 00:13:41.515
gonna those places.

263
00:13:41.515 --> 00:13:43.210
So pretty cool.
