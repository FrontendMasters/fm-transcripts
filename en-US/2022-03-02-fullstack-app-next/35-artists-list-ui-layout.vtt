1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.757
Let's finish out this homepage.

2
00:00:01.757 --> 00:00:05.499
Now that we have our artists,
if we go back and look at the design,

3
00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:08.986
it's just a left to right,
it's just like a row of artists.

4
00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:11.962
And this will be pretty easy we have some
titles at the top, we got a title or

5
00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:13.210
a subtitle and then like a row.

6
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.590
This card here,
it's a little artists card little thing.

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.311
So let's do that first thing
is we'll make a like a div or

8
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:26.138
a box for this whole section here so
we'll make that box.

9
00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:31.004
So we have that box there.

10
00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:32.092
And then we'll make another box for
just the content at the top.

11
00:00:32.092 --> 00:00:39.160
And then we'll make another box for
this row, right.

12
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.201
So inside that box,
here's that content at the top.

13
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:46.699
And then here's the row,
which will probably be a flux.

14
00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.550
I'm actually just gonna say flex for
this second one.

15
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.215
There we go.

16
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:55.947
So then for the content at
the top I'm going to use the text

17
00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:59.103
component like we've done before and

18
00:00:59.103 --> 00:01:04.638
it just says top artists this month,
and then only visible to you.

19
00:01:04.638 --> 00:01:10.053
So, that's what we'll say
top artists this month.

20
00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:16.439
And underneath it, Only visible to you and

21
00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.489
we'll get the sizing right in a minute.

22
00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:24.899
And then for this flex,
we just got a bunch of artists cards here.

23
00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.281
So I'll just render the artist name for
now until we make an artist card.

24
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:32.915
So I'll just say, artists.map,

25
00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:38.166
get an artist, and then render a text for

26
00:01:38.166 --> 00:01:46.829
now until we actually make an artist
card with the artists.name.

27
00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.900
Cool, now I got to import all that
stuff because it's freaking out.

28
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.370
So got ourselves a box.

29
00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.880
There we go.

30
00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.170
And then we have a text and
then we have a flux.

31
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.833
Okay, so I render all those and
just to make sure the color is white, so

32
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:16.610
I'm just gonna put color white up here and
I think the justify stuff is cool.

33
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.180
So we should be good there.

34
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.138
So let's go back check it out and
yeah, here is our text, the top,

35
00:02:22.138 --> 00:02:27.400
our text right underneath it and then all
of our artists names just mushed together.

36
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.907
So the layouts good.

37
00:02:27.907 --> 00:02:30.341
It doesn't look like it
with the layouts fine.

38
00:02:30.341 --> 00:02:31.716
It's exactly what we wanted.

39
00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:37.028
Obviously to add some padding you need
to adjust the size of the text and

40
00:02:37.028 --> 00:02:39.198
then make some artists box.

41
00:02:39.198 --> 00:02:39.784
So let's do that.

42
00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:43.240
So if you look at the design,
we need some padding on the left so

43
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.641
we do some left padding.

44
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:46.235
Probably on the right as well.

45
00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:49.938
Need to make the title a little
bigger than the bottom one.

46
00:02:49.938 --> 00:02:52.222
It looks like on a magnitude
of at least three.

47
00:02:52.222 --> 00:02:53.719
And then we obviously need the artist box.

48
00:02:53.719 --> 00:03:00.199
So that's what we'll do so
we'll add some padding here, padding x.

49
00:03:03.034 --> 00:03:04.655
That will do like 40 pixels.

50
00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:07.238
We'll play around with that number.

51
00:03:07.238 --> 00:03:10.013
And then this one's a little bigger so
we'll say font size.

52
00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:16.766
2xl and then fontWeight.

53
00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:18.282
I think that was bold.

54
00:03:18.282 --> 00:03:20.392
It looked pretty bold.

55
00:03:20.392 --> 00:03:25.716
And as long as it's way smaller it

56
00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:32.762
was like font size of
like let's do medium.

57
00:03:32.762 --> 00:03:33.904
I think that's one.

58
00:03:33.904 --> 00:03:35.238
There we go.

59
00:03:35.238 --> 00:03:36.428
So we'll try that.

60
00:03:36.428 --> 00:03:38.937
We'll see what that looks like.

61
00:03:38.937 --> 00:03:40.239
Yeah, it's a lot better.

62
00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.314
Padding looks good.

63
00:03:42.314 --> 00:03:45.395
I think this one's still a lot smaller but
we could play around with it.

64
00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:48.024
And then now we just need
to get the artist card and

65
00:03:48.024 --> 00:03:49.960
I'm going to change it from green.

66
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.476
I actually like green but
I'm sick of looking at it so

67
00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:54.030
I'm gonna change it to purple.

68
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.899
There we go,
purple is a lot better to look at.

69
00:03:55.899 --> 00:04:01.861
Okay, so now we need to add some margin
underneath this box that has the text so

70
00:04:01.861 --> 00:04:06.170
we can push our artists
down a little more.

71
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.470
And then we need to make our artist cards.

72
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.450
What's in fake avatars and
we should be good.

73
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.323
So let's do that.

74
00:04:11.323 --> 00:04:15.895
So here's the box that's housing our text,
this is why I added a box around this.

75
00:04:15.895 --> 00:04:18.461
Cuz I knew we were gonna have to
add some margin to the bottom.

76
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:23.046
So if we had both of these texts and and
all the artists in the same container,

77
00:04:23.046 --> 00:04:26.515
there would be no way to put
some spacing between them.

78
00:04:26.515 --> 00:04:32.045
So, again, I think really good UI just
comes with putting divs around everything.

79
00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:34.085
But not too many.

80
00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:37.113
So we're gonna say margin bottom, and

81
00:04:37.113 --> 00:04:42.079
I don't know 20 pixels, okay,
so 20 pixels is not enough.

82
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.380
To be a little more generous, so like 40.

83
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.005
And now for the artist cards.

84
00:04:50.005 --> 00:04:52.041
Typically when I make a new component,

85
00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:54.447
what I'll do is I'll just
make it in the page or

86
00:04:54.447 --> 00:04:58.782
the other component that I'm using it in
and then I'll move it out so it's on file.

87
00:04:58.782 --> 00:05:00.915
That way I can see it immediately.

88
00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:02.638
So I'll just make the component
right here where this text is.

89
00:05:02.638 --> 00:05:09.222
So this will be a box, And

90
00:05:09.222 --> 00:05:13.251
looks like he just has a bigger avatar
the top some rounded corners and

91
00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:14.859
it's slightly brighter.

92
00:05:14.859 --> 00:05:18.183
It's not affected by the gradient.

93
00:05:18.183 --> 00:05:20.894
This is a solid like gray color.

94
00:05:20.894 --> 00:05:24.939
I wonder if it's solid gray
because this background's gray, or

95
00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.480
if it's always gray,
no matter what the background is.

96
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.371
I don't have another screenshot
another color to say.

97
00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:35.322
We're just gonna make it
great no matter what.

98
00:05:35.322 --> 00:05:38.410
And that looks funky then I guess we could
just make it the color of the background.

99
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.220
We'll go from there.

100
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.570
So we have our box here.

101
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.300
We're going to give it
a background of gray dots.

102
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.510
Something a little darker.

103
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.970
Let's try 100 we'll play around with that.

104
00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.936
It has a border radius of like four
pixels because it's slightly round, and

105
00:05:57.936 --> 00:06:02.368
then it has padding, but
not too much looks like ten to 15 pixels.

106
00:06:02.368 --> 00:06:04.015
All around.

107
00:06:04.015 --> 00:06:08.316
I'm gonna try 15 and I'm just gonna
put the artist's name here so

108
00:06:08.316 --> 00:06:09.984
we can see it right quick.

109
00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:22.935
Yeah, that it looks way too light so maybe
like 900 that's a little better, okay.

110
00:06:22.935 --> 00:06:28.807
So, we got that.

111
00:06:28.807 --> 00:06:31.050
And then now we got to add
some spacing between them.

112
00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.993
So, I think what we can do here is in
the flexbox we can say, justify, and

113
00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:38.980
then space-between we could try that.

114
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.730
See what happens.

115
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.230
There we go.
That'll put some space between them.

116
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.437
Power flexbox so we got that.

117
00:06:46.437 --> 00:06:50.750
I'm not sure that's what we want,
though because it'll evenly spaced them.

118
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.539
Whereas in the UI,
they're all close together and

119
00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:55.150
if there's just not enough it'll
just end off on the right.

120
00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.694
So maybe space between is
probably not what we want and

121
00:06:58.694 --> 00:07:00.910
instead, I might just add some.

122
00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.362
What I'll do here is follow my own
advice that I've given you and

123
00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:11.720
make another div so another box like this.

124
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.260
Then I'll put the card in that box.

125
00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.481
And then this new box that I created is
gonna act as a container that has padding

126
00:07:22.481 --> 00:07:27.379
on the x and y for however much pixels
in between each one of these switch,

127
00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:30.260
looks like no more than 20 pixels.

128
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.820
So, we'll say padding x, 20 pixels.

129
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.840
And that will give us
the space that we want.

130
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.091
Or that nice gutter there.

131
00:07:38.091 --> 00:07:39.727
All right 20 pixels is too much.

132
00:07:39.727 --> 00:07:41.870
Let's do ten, there we go.

133
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:45.350
So now we got the ten pixels gutter
without doing the space between which

134
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:49.130
evenly distributes all the way to the end
which is probably not what you want.

135
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.500
This will just put spacing between
them and not going to then.

136
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.546
So usually when I do flexbox,
I don't like to have the element that I

137
00:07:58.546 --> 00:08:03.520
want to be in the flexbox be
the direct child of the flex container.

138
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.330
I usually wrap that in another div.

139
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.442
That way I can treat that
div as a container and

140
00:08:08.442 --> 00:08:11.430
add padding around it to
control the gutter sizes.

141
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.884
Whereas if you added padding
to the actual element,

142
00:08:13.884 --> 00:08:16.930
you'll be adding padding
to the inside of this box.

143
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.909
And that's not what you want.

144
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:23.306
So, yeah, that's typically why and
how I do that.

145
00:08:23.306 --> 00:08:26.436
The other thing is that these
boxes have a fixed width.

146
00:08:26.436 --> 00:08:31.223
So right now they're just based off
the width of the text of the artist.

147
00:08:31.223 --> 00:08:32.207
So we don't want that.

148
00:08:32.207 --> 00:08:33.833
So we got to give these a fixed width.

149
00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:40.389
And we can just say,
I don't know each of you will be.

150
00:08:42.765 --> 00:08:44.415
I don't know, 20, that's too big.

151
00:08:44.415 --> 00:08:52.054
Let's just say 10% and then you will be
whatever your parent is with of 100%.

152
00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.120
As to small, almost do 20%.

153
00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.200
There we go.

154
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.081
That's a lot better.

155
00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:04.065
So now they're fixed width,
they're really cool and

156
00:09:04.065 --> 00:09:07.189
looks like we need to
add the avatar image.

157
00:09:07.189 --> 00:09:10.778
And then we need to put
the text underneath it,

158
00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:12.900
and we should be good to go.

159
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:20.580
So for the image we will use
the image tag from chakra.

160
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.860
So let me import that.

161
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:28.420
Let me get that image tag from chakra,
there we go.

162
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.497
Got the image tag from chakra UI/react.

163
00:09:31.497 --> 00:09:35.579
Gonna go up here add a source and

164
00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:40.140
then we can go find a placeholder.

165
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.590
Let's add some cats.

166
00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:47.200
So placeholder kitten some placekitten.

167
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.700
There we go.

168
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.500
We'll add some cats as our avatars.

169
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.276
Super, cute cats.

170
00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:54.294
So we got some cats.

171
00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:57.390
I'll make a square because
we're we're making it round.

172
00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:02.348
So make this thing round
border radius will be 100%,

173
00:10:02.348 --> 00:10:06.790
I think we got to give this
thing a width and stuff but

174
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.809
we'll play around with it later.

175
00:10:09.809 --> 00:10:13.255
And then underneath the image,
we're gonna put the text, but

176
00:10:13.255 --> 00:10:15.280
because there's two lines of text.

177
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.272
I'm gonna wrap both of them in a box so

178
00:10:18.272 --> 00:10:22.909
I can control that text together and
not independently so

179
00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:28.626
I'll make another box of this image and
I'll make one text two texts.

180
00:10:37.872 --> 00:10:40.379
Cool the first text will just
say the artist his name.

181
00:10:40.379 --> 00:10:47.217
And the second one will just, I think
it literally just says the word artist.

182
00:10:47.217 --> 00:10:49.128
That's it.

183
00:10:52.232 --> 00:10:52.875
There we go.

184
00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:55.200
Got our artists cats.

185
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.375
That's pretty cool.

186
00:11:01.446 --> 00:11:02.804
Just both cats hanging out.

187
00:11:02.804 --> 00:11:05.634
So then I'll just add some margin.

188
00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:11.305
Got some margin top to
this text right here.

189
00:11:11.305 --> 00:11:16.096
Have like 10 pixels
scoot that down a little

190
00:11:16.096 --> 00:11:21.277
more maybe a little more
20 pixels there we go.

191
00:11:21.277 --> 00:11:23.875
The scroll works perfectly, and

192
00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:27.877
now we just need to set this
to be a bigger font size.

193
00:11:27.877 --> 00:11:31.594
Let's say extra large,

194
00:11:31.594 --> 00:11:36.375
too big, large, much better.

195
00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:38.901
And then I think this one's just small.

196
00:11:40.686 --> 00:11:42.925
There we go.

197
00:11:42.925 --> 00:11:45.923
Maybe even smaller x.

198
00:11:45.923 --> 00:11:52.215
There we go cool and it is left aligned so

199
00:11:52.215 --> 00:11:59.090
I think we're good there that seems cool.
