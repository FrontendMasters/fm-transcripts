1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.060
So for this next part, we're gonna
actually build the main feature of this

2
00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.130
app, which is going to be
the part that plays music.

3
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.394
So I'm just at this point,
we got the playlist going,

4
00:00:09.394 --> 00:00:13.320
we got the songs populated, we got the
user profile, we got the authentication.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.569
We got all those things using these
amazing tools working together at

6
00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:20.880
different runtimes, and now we're
finally going to get some music playing.

7
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.332
So first, let's look over the scope
of what we're gonna be covering,

8
00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:27.520
when it comes to what we'll be doing and
what we won't be doing.

9
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.836
If you look at the design here,
at the music play bar,

10
00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:33.136
we will be adding most of this stuff.

11
00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:36.578
Some of the things we won't be adding
obviously won't be like this album art,

12
00:00:36.578 --> 00:00:38.734
because we just don't
have album art right now.

13
00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:43.720
But we'll be adding the artists name and
song that's currently playing,

14
00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.295
we won't be doing the favorite icon or
this one here.

15
00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:50.847
We will do this entire feature
set here with the playing,

16
00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:53.146
the previous next skip and shuffle.

17
00:00:53.146 --> 00:00:57.365
With the seek bar where you can drag and
click and get the scrubbing, and

18
00:00:57.365 --> 00:01:00.750
then we won't opt into any of
these like sharing things.

19
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.010
I think there's also
a volume slider on here.

20
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.432
Although the way that we build
it adding these features,

21
00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:08.390
like the volume slider is
actually not that hard to do.

22
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.137
So it's, again, something else that
you could do if you want to, but

23
00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:14.900
that's just the scope of
what we're going to do.

24
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.006
And before we hop into that,
we need to go in and

25
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:23.521
fix some things because you might have
issues around when the jadibooti expires.

26
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:25.521
I think we put an expiration
time of 8 hours, so

27
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.171
it's been 8 hours since you did that.

28
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.565
You're probably gonna run to an issue
where you can't [LAUGH] do anything.

29
00:01:29.565 --> 00:01:33.282
So we need to actually handle our errors
or increase your data for tea time,

30
00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:37.560
something greater than 8 hours, but
you'll just run into it eventually.

31
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.943
So the way we'll get around that
issue actually is to head into

32
00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:46.760
the lib auth file, and then inside
of our validate token function.

33
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.344
We just need to, basically,
we can handle an error here or

34
00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:56.043
we can handle the error wherever we
are using this validate token function.

35
00:01:56.043 --> 00:02:00.197
So basically JWT verify expects a token
to be here, but if you don't have one for

36
00:02:00.197 --> 00:02:03.425
whatever reason,
you cleared your browser out or whatever.

37
00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:06.920
And there's this thing is undefined, it's
gonna freak out and it's gonna break and

38
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.337
that's gonna cause some issues.

39
00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.333
So that's the cause of some
issues you might be having,

40
00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.254
if you're trying to load up a page.

41
00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:17.797
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna
go to wherever we're using this,

42
00:02:17.797 --> 00:02:22.726
which I believe is inside of the playlist
page inside of GIT server side props.

43
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:24.986
This is where we're using it, so

44
00:02:24.986 --> 00:02:29.264
what we wanna do here is we just
want to just handle this error and

45
00:02:29.264 --> 00:02:33.660
redirect the user back to a sign
in page if nothing comes back.

46
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.226
So the best way to do that is
we'll make a variable here,

47
00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:43.779
we'll say, user, then we'll do
a try catch, whatever that was.

48
00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.139
We'll do a try catch,
get this error here, and

49
00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:51.435
we'll move up this validate
token inside of this try catch.

50
00:02:51.435 --> 00:02:55.126
And I'll just set it to user equals
that validate token like that.

51
00:02:57.028 --> 00:03:01.177
And then inside the catch,
I believe you can return a redirect here.

52
00:03:01.177 --> 00:03:04.212
Inside of next AS, we can see redirects,

53
00:03:04.212 --> 00:03:09.348
I don't know if it has to say,
permanent, I can look it up real quick.

54
00:03:09.348 --> 00:03:14.064
But we're gonna do a redirect and
then we're gonna say, path, and

55
00:03:14.064 --> 00:03:17.309
that's going to be to
slash sign in like that.

56
00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:19.924
And actually we'll just get
rid of the redirect right now,

57
00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:23.125
we'll look at the the live data, and
this right here will fix the issue.

58
00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:28.098
So now we have the user, all we have to do
now is go down to where we're using the ID

59
00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:32.063
for the user ID inside of
the playlist.find mini where query.

60
00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:36.168
And change that to user.id
instead of just ID, so

61
00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:40.777
this will handle that error
if valid token error is out.

62
00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:42.061
You don't have a token,

63
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.130
you should even see this page
redirects you back to sign in.

64
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.706
So we're going to return
an object that looks like this,

65
00:03:50.706 --> 00:03:56.175
so it has a redirect property on it,
which is an object.

66
00:03:56.175 --> 00:03:59.283
Permanent false because we don't
want this to be permanent, and

67
00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:01.098
then destination will be slash sign.

68
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:11.347
So now if you don't have a cookie or
if it's not signed in,

69
00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:14.790
you try to go to this page and validate
token, you'll just get redirected.
