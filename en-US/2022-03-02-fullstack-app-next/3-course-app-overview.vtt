1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.527
The next thing that I wanted to talk about
after we have everything set up is how

2
00:00:04.527 --> 00:00:09.000
we're gonna break this app down and
kind of the scope of what we wanna cover.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.569
So if you head over to
that link again in Notion,

4
00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:15.958
at the top I have some screenshots of the
app, so these will be our design assets.

5
00:00:15.958 --> 00:00:18.395
So if you've never worked at a company,

6
00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:23.200
maybe you just graduated out of bootcamp,
maybe you're fresh out of college,

7
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.173
or maybe you've been contracting, you
just really haven't worked with a team.

8
00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:31.726
Typically what's gonna happen, especially
if you're doing frontend work, or even

9
00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:35.134
full stack work, is there's gonna be some
designers and some product managers and

10
00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:37.729
some UX folks on your team that
have already done the research.

11
00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:39.472
They've already did the interviews, the
qualitative, the quantitative analysis,

12
00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.109
they did all this stuff to really figure
out, here's a design that we wanna make.

13
00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:42.259
Hopefully did that, I don't know.

14
00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:45.579
Some people don't,
it depends on what company you work at.

15
00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.358
But for most companies, yeah, there's a
lot of research that goes into the design.

16
00:00:50.358 --> 00:00:54.114
It's not just someone sitting down just
cranking things out on Sketch or Figma.

17
00:00:54.114 --> 00:00:57.414
And you as an engineer, you're gonna
take those designs and you're going to

18
00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:00.839
implement them as close to if not exactly
the same that the designers intended.

19
00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.992
Because no one wants to hire engineers
that can't implement a design.

20
00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:10.210
If I'm a company and I hire the best
designer that we could afford and

21
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.330
our engineers can't implement their
designs, then what was the point, right?

22
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.363
So our engineers have to be
just as good as the designers.

23
00:01:17.363 --> 00:01:21.125
So your job is to get pretty close if
not exactly the same as the designs.

24
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:25.620
And in today's world, there's so
many design tools out there that can take

25
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.863
a design from Figma or
Sketch and they'll output CSS.

26
00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:30.312
It'll even output React.

27
00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.152
Some of them even spit
out React components and

28
00:01:32.152 --> 00:01:33.622
animations, which is pretty cool.

29
00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:37.067
I'm a little more old school, so
we're just gonna look at the design and

30
00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:38.721
we're gonna get it done that way.

31
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:43.723
But traditionally, you'll probably have a
company that uses something like Zeppelin,

32
00:01:43.723 --> 00:01:48.351
or even Figma spits out stuff now, that
kind of just gets you there, pretty close.

33
00:01:48.351 --> 00:01:51.532
We're not gonna do that,
we're gonna eyeball everything and

34
00:01:51.532 --> 00:01:53.580
get as close as we can on this first pass.

35
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.192
So anyway, looking at these designs,
just kind of wanna go over the scope and

36
00:01:57.192 --> 00:02:00.820
how we're gonna think about these pages
and components and stuff like that.

37
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.250
And then we'll hop right
into the foundation of it.

38
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.185
This is what you're greeted with
after you sign in to the Spotify app.

39
00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:09.435
This is kinda like all
the things about you as a user.

40
00:02:09.435 --> 00:02:12.565
And you can see right here,
it says my top artists this month.

41
00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:18.223
Tracks I listened to, there's a picture of
me and my name and all this other stuff.

42
00:02:18.223 --> 00:02:20.781
How many playlists I have,
how many followers.

43
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:23.484
Which I didn't even know was
a thing on Spotify until recently,

44
00:02:23.484 --> 00:02:24.495
you can follow people.

45
00:02:24.495 --> 00:02:27.627
And then on the left,
we have a standard navigation, but then

46
00:02:27.627 --> 00:02:31.313
what's unique to me is all my playlists
on the left as well that scrolls.

47
00:02:31.313 --> 00:02:34.868
So, just looking at this,
I can break this down in a couple ways.

48
00:02:34.868 --> 00:02:40.280
One thing I noticed is that no matter
what page I'm on, the sidebar is always

49
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.282
present in this bottom, what I call
the play bar, is always present.

50
00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:46.992
So those would be our layout.

51
00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:49.375
That's gonna be part of
something that never changes.

52
00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:51.724
So it doesn't matter
what page we route to,

53
00:02:51.724 --> 00:02:55.544
those components need to stay on
the page and they should never change.

54
00:02:55.544 --> 00:02:59.127
They shouldn't be dependent
on what route you're on.

55
00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.801
They shouldn't refresh,
especially in the case of the play bar.

56
00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:05.582
Image in a song was playing and then you
went to go click on another playlist, but

57
00:03:05.582 --> 00:03:09.140
because this play bar was part of that
page, it reloaded and it refreshed,

58
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.511
your song would start over.

59
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.819
That would be really bad.

60
00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.742
So those things sit on top of the page and
they never change.

61
00:03:14.742 --> 00:03:18.789
And the actual page itself is
everything that's in this area here.

62
00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:23.863
So what we wanna do is create the layout
and then make sure we render our

63
00:03:23.863 --> 00:03:30.008
components, our pages, inside of this
layout so that these things never change.

64
00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:31.729
Does that make sense?

65
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.591
Okay, and that's literally how I break
things down,when I look at designs.

66
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:39.128
I always try to figure out, where's the
layout, where are the reusable components,

67
00:03:39.128 --> 00:03:40.740
what are the things that I need to make?

68
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.497
Even just now I can look at these and
obviously this is a reusable component.

69
00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:46.770
Literally, this whole page is a reusable
component cuz it's pretty much

70
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.574
the same as this.

71
00:03:47.574 --> 00:03:50.468
There's a gradient at the top, there's
a section underneath, there's an image,

72
00:03:50.468 --> 00:03:51.242
there's a big title.

73
00:03:51.242 --> 00:03:55.442
Same thing here, there's an image,
there's a big title, there's a gradient,

74
00:03:55.442 --> 00:03:56.831
even that's a component.

75
00:03:56.831 --> 00:03:59.033
So in my head, I'm already thinking,

76
00:03:59.033 --> 00:04:02.770
what are the reusable things that I
have to make to make this thing so

77
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.335
I can actually get through this app a lot
faster without having to repeat myself.

78
00:04:07.335 --> 00:04:10.476
And yeah, that's kinda how
I think about this process.

79
00:04:10.476 --> 00:04:13.073
In fact, some of the interviews
that I've done at companies,

80
00:04:13.073 --> 00:04:16.064
I've been asked to look at screenshots and
break it down just like that.

81
00:04:16.064 --> 00:04:19.430
And what do you think of the state,
what do you think of the layout,

82
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.217
what's gonna be reusable,
what about performance?

83
00:04:22.217 --> 00:04:24.678
That's usually something, if you
start doing senior level interviews,

84
00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:27.450
they'll start asking questions like that
to get you to think about the architecture

85
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.208
of a design like this.

86
00:04:28.208 --> 00:04:33.075
So it's not uncommon.

87
00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:35.670
Yeah, and then if we keep going,

88
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.944
you can see that there's
obviously different pages.

89
00:04:39.944 --> 00:04:44.102
As far as these over here, I'm not sure
if we'll get to this library page or

90
00:04:44.102 --> 00:04:46.808
the search page,
probably not the search page,

91
00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:49.783
because search could take a lot of time,
we'll see.

92
00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:53.375
But we'll definitely get
the important stuff done.

93
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:57.523
So there might be something left for
you all to do if you fancy that.

94
00:04:57.523 --> 00:04:58.604
Well, let's do it.

95
00:04:58.604 --> 00:05:01.465
Let's get this layout done because I
think that's the most important thing,

96
00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:02.428
is to get the layout done.

97
00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:05.184
And then from there,
we'll talk about authentication and

98
00:05:05.184 --> 00:05:06.516
how we can protect this app.

99
00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:09.962
And the pages I didn't take a screenshot
of, which is the login page and

100
00:05:09.962 --> 00:05:12.967
stuff like that, but
that was just super bloated on Spotify.

101
00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:15.079
So we'll just make one up,
we'll just make our own design.

102
00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:18.091
That one had Google, Facebook,
and we're not gonna do all that.

103
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:19.875
We're just gonna do email, password.

104
00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:20.733
So we'll make our own design for that.

105
00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:22.950
And then, yeah, we'll do that next.
