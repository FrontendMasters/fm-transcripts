1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.997
Like I said we are gonna continue
working on this sidebar here and

2
00:00:04.997 --> 00:00:09.511
getting it as close if not exactly
the same as this design here.

3
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:12.822
So let's get started and
again you have this link so

4
00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:17.225
you should be able to reference
this design as closely as possible.

5
00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:19.298
But obviously I'm gonna
be walking through it and

6
00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:22.275
kinda narrating my thoughts
the whole time like I've been doing.

7
00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.195
So let's hop into it.

8
00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:27.955
And actually the first thing I'm
gonna do cuz it's just annoying me is

9
00:00:27.955 --> 00:00:31.945
I'm just gonna just clean out this
homepage inside of pages index.tsx.

10
00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:33.165
It's just distracting.

11
00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.805
I mean, it's really cool that
we get this but I don't need it.

12
00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:39.040
So I'm just gonna put
a div here that says home.

13
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.960
And just that way it's clear
we have a blank slate.

14
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.590
It's not in the way.

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.950
We don't need that code again, that was
generated when we did next create app.

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.450
It's not code that we wrote.

17
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.410
I'm just gonna get rid of it.

18
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.149
So that way when I go back and
check the sidebar in the browser,

19
00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.574
I can actually focus on the sidebar,
not all the stuff that got generated so,

20
00:00:55.574 --> 00:00:57.231
you can put whatever you want there.

21
00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:58.189
I'm just gonna clean it out.

22
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.560
And then the next thing I'm gonna do
is we're gonna make a new component.

23
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.330
And I'm just gonna call it sidebar.

24
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.360
So let's do that.

25
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.480
File called sidebar.tsx.

26
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.466
And this is gonna be
a pretty big component.

27
00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:19.391
Typically I think what I would probably do
is break it up to even smaller components.

28
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:23.864
But for the sake of time and not trying to
have 30 components all over this app we're

29
00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:27.899
just gonna put everything in the small
component and capsulate it that way.

30
00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.181
So if you feel like hey it's got
its components getting pretty big

31
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:38.476
yeah I'm with you on that just
trying to save some time time here.

32
00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:40.723
So I'm just gonna make
a sidebar component here.

33
00:01:40.723 --> 00:01:45.700
And notice if you've used react lately
that you typically I guess unless you use

34
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.824
the latest version rack but typically you
have to import React at the top so it's in

35
00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:55.800
scope so that the parser, the JSX parser
can use the JSX pragma provided by React

36
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.090
to parser JSX or in the latest version of
React, you don't have to do that anymore.

37
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.700
And actually yes,
use the latest version of React.

38
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.190
So you notice I haven't imported
React at the top of a page of JSX.

39
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.722
That's why you don't have to do
it anymore in the latest version.

40
00:02:08.722 --> 00:02:11.031
So if you do import it
it's not gonna break.

41
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:15.821
It's totally fine, but
you can also make your own JSX parser and

42
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:21.956
parse it yourself which is really crazy
that's the thing You should look into it.

43
00:02:21.956 --> 00:02:24.578
In fact I think that's what the SX
property all the components use.

44
00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:28.237
They use their own parser and
add it so it's pretty cool.

45
00:02:28.237 --> 00:02:33.970
Anyway getting sidetracked I could talk
about crazy stuff like that all day so

46
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.924
to export this sidebar and
I'm just gonna return thing that says.

47
00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.890
A div that says hello from sidebar.

48
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.618
And typically, I always like to just
hello world all my components first and

49
00:02:45.618 --> 00:02:49.430
get them rendered on the page to
make sure that it's hooked up right.

50
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.525
And then I go back and make them work cuz
One thing I hate doing is like you put all

51
00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:58.010
this work into a component and then you
go test it out and doesn't even show up.

52
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.110
And now it's like well
why is it not showing up?

53
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.067
Is it cuz I didn't hook it up right Is
there something wrong in my component.

54
00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:06.914
So I kinda just like to get that stuff
out of the way first and then go back and

55
00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:10.886
fix it and that way you can also see it
in the browser as you're developing and

56
00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:12.086
you can go from there.

57
00:03:12.086 --> 00:03:16.971
I think it's pretty hard to develop
a UI without actually looking at

58
00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:19.125
it unless you're just a god.

59
00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:23.526
She's just that good, I prefer to look
at my components as I'm building them.

60
00:03:23.526 --> 00:03:27.864
So we have our sidebar here or go back to
our player layout and I'm gonna import

61
00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:32.027
my sidebar here I should be able to
type in sidebar and get a Autocomplete.

62
00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:32.655
There we go.

63
00:03:33.985 --> 00:03:38.143
And right here where I have
the sidebar word are gonna

64
00:03:38.143 --> 00:03:41.933
replace with the sidebar
component like that.

65
00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:44.560
So now that I have that I'm
gonna go check it out and

66
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.185
you can see right there
hello from sidebar.

67
00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:51.770
We got home on the right and we got
player at the bottom exactly the way it

68
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.055
should be all things in
the universe are correct.

69
00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:57.310
So let's work on this sidebar.

70
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.136
It's gonna be a couple
things that we need to do.

71
00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:07.170
Chakra UI has this really sweet thing
that we're gonna use, it's called a list.

72
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.846
If you go look at it, you can see it's
pretty much exactly what we want out of

73
00:04:11.846 --> 00:04:16.094
a menu I mean, at the end of the day,
it's just a glorified UL or OL.

74
00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:19.350
But again, we get to style it and
do some crazy stuff.

75
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.504
So we're gonna be using the list here,
which has like, you have a list and

76
00:04:23.504 --> 00:04:24.990
you have like a list item.

77
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.080
You got all this crazy stuff.

78
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.230
You can add icons to them.

79
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.280
You can see right here,
you can add icons to them.

80
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.107
So we'll be taking advantage of this
whole list components feature that

81
00:04:35.107 --> 00:04:38.125
chakra has and that's what we'll be using.

82
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:41.507
So I'm gonna head back to our code,
and I'm gonna import some of those.

83
00:04:41.507 --> 00:04:46.699
So I'm gonna import from chakra UI
layout ,so at chakra UI layouts and

84
00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:52.870
the things that I want here are gonna
be Release box cuz that's our div.

85
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.520
Muscle go use list, list item, list icon.

86
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.560
There we go.

87
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.140
And then we also wanna do a divider,
which is exactly what it sounds like.

88
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.280
It's just like a line that
sits in the middle nowhere.

89
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.697
We're gonna do that to divide
cuz if we go back to our design,

90
00:05:07.697 --> 00:05:10.790
you can see there's like
a little divider right here.

91
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.190
You can barely see it.

92
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.978
Zoom out a little bit.

93
00:05:13.978 --> 00:05:16.550
It's right there.

94
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.484
See that the only shows up there,
but there's a divider there.

95
00:05:19.484 --> 00:05:21.170
It's barely there, but it's there.

96
00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.648
So we're gonna get the divider.

97
00:05:23.648 --> 00:05:27.793
They have this other sweet component
called center, which centers things.

98
00:05:27.793 --> 00:05:30.707
I can't tell you how many times
I've had gotten on Google and

99
00:05:30.707 --> 00:05:32.604
look up how to center something to CSS.

100
00:05:32.604 --> 00:05:34.313
And I clicked on the same
article every time.

101
00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:38.367
It's the one from, yes,
CSS tricks and they show you,

102
00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:41.395
do you know the size of it, yes, go here.

103
00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:44.895
Do you know the vertical?

104
00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:48.276
I've looked at that article for the last
six years cuz I just don't remember how to

105
00:05:48.276 --> 00:05:51.210
center stuff, Well,
now this component just does it for me.

106
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.010
It's like that article in a component.

107
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.640
So it's perfect.

108
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.910
So I'm gonna use the center component.

109
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.350
There's a thing called link box.

110
00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:00.060
This is actually cool.

111
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.250
We'll talk about that a little bit.

112
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.252
And the one that works with
is called link overlay.

113
00:06:04.252 --> 00:06:09.176
Those two components basically allow
us to make a click target which is

114
00:06:09.176 --> 00:06:15.270
basically a word but have a bigger surface
which is the size of a hole link item.

115
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.075
If you ever had to do that manually it's
kinda annoying to like get this whole

116
00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:22.167
thing to work, this just does it for
you so it's really cool so

117
00:06:22.167 --> 00:06:24.600
we'll be doing that from Layouts.

118
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.650
And then we're gonna have a couple
components that we're gonna use as icons.

119
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.970
So we're gonna import those as well.

120
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.078
So we're gonna import from this really
cool library called react icons that you

121
00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:37.950
also have installed.

122
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.400
And you can go look at their website.

123
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.120
In fact, I'll just pull it up right quick.

124
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.031
It's literally the only Live
that I use for icons and

125
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:46.540
react like there's nothing better.

126
00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.500
It's all free.

127
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.468
And they pretty much went and found every
icon pack that you've ever heard of, and

128
00:06:51.468 --> 00:06:53.250
turn them into components.

129
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:56.180
And you get them all here as imports.

130
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.569
And every like UI live has like adopted
the functionality to consume these so

131
00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.170
they pretty much work with
every UI live Lead too.

132
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.386
So it's really cool, instead of before
this you would have to go to each

133
00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.640
individual, one of these websites and
get the icons.

134
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.710
Now they're just all here.

135
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:15.701
It's really cool, so
we'll be using some of these,

136
00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.700
feel free to play around with that.

137
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.792
And the ones that we want are gonna come
from the MD which is material design, so

138
00:07:21.792 --> 00:07:24.590
we're using some of
the material design icons here.

139
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.860
And we're gonna do MD home,
which is the home icon.

140
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.705
We're also gonna do indie
search the other ones

141
00:07:33.705 --> 00:07:37.950
we're gonna use is in the Music Library.

142
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.300
I mean it's getting really specific here.

143
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.795
It's like they knew I was coming.

144
00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:44.580
[LAUGH] Music or is it music?

145
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.800
MD Library Music.

146
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.610
There we go.

147
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:54.342
Library Music, and then we're also
gonna do Md Playlist ahead, like,

148
00:07:54.342 --> 00:07:57.147
can't make this up, they already had it.

149
00:07:57.147 --> 00:08:00.210
And the last one is Md Favorite.

150
00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:05.342
And the reason I know I needed all these
icons cuz again, if we go back and

151
00:08:05.342 --> 00:08:08.644
look at the design, that's all
the icons here, there's a home icon,

152
00:08:08.644 --> 00:08:10.430
there's a search icon.

153
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.660
There's just like book one.

154
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.550
There's the ad one.

155
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.350
There's the favorite one.

156
00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.518
That's where I got all
of those icons from,

157
00:08:16.518 --> 00:08:19.270
all five of these icons were
cuz that's what I saw here.
