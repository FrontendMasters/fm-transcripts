1
00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:01.333
All right, let's keep moving.

2
00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:05.883
So now, we need to actually get some

3
00:00:05.883 --> 00:00:10.442
music in here and get things going.

4
00:00:10.442 --> 00:00:14.789
I think we actually need music
inherit to get this next part working.

5
00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.783
So let's do that, so what we'll do
before we continue working on the UI

6
00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:22.045
is try to get some music in here.

7
00:00:22.045 --> 00:00:25.902
Which means we're gonna have to
get the data from somewhere and

8
00:00:25.902 --> 00:00:28.317
populate the songs and get them going.

9
00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:31.351
Luckily for us, we already set up
the state to be able to do this.

10
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.157
So what we're gonna do is head
over to where you would add music,

11
00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:39.541
which in this case will
be the playlist page.

12
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:46.579
So pages/playlist/ID, so inside of here.

13
00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.532
And then we have the SongTable, right?

14
00:00:48.532 --> 00:00:52.423
So if you look at the SongTable,
there's gonna be this big play button.

15
00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:55.373
So when someone clicks this
button we want to add songs.

16
00:00:55.373 --> 00:00:57.437
That means, hey,
I want to play this playlist.

17
00:00:57.437 --> 00:00:59.807
That's what that big green
button is on the playlist.

18
00:00:59.807 --> 00:01:01.682
It's this one, that's what this button is.

19
00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:04.298
So if someone clicks this,
they want to playlist.

20
00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.776
So that should send some
active songs to the store.

21
00:01:07.776 --> 00:01:12.060
And if someone clicks an individual
song that should send an active song and

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.062
the playlist that that song
belongs to to the store.

23
00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:19.577
So these are our two places where we
actually want to update the state and

24
00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:20.939
get the songs going.

25
00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.059
And then inside of the player or
the player bar,

26
00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:28.976
we can retrieve that state and now we
can actually have some songs playing.

27
00:01:28.976 --> 00:01:29.787
So let's do that.

28
00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:34.599
So we'll just have to add some few click
handlers on these buttons to actually

29
00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:35.644
get that going.

30
00:01:35.644 --> 00:01:39.211
And like I said,
we did create those actions yesterday.

31
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:42.470
So setting that up shouldn't
be that difficult, so

32
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.591
what we'll do is we'll go
back to the SongTable.

33
00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:51.544
And we'll import those actions
that we created from Easy Peasy.

34
00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:56.049
So we want to import from Easy Peasy here,
and

35
00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.380
we want to import the use action.

36
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.068
Or useStoreActions,
sorry, useStoreActions.

37
00:02:04.068 --> 00:02:05.960
And at the top of here,

38
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.050
we just want to get a reference
to the setActiveSong action.

39
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.165
And then also the one for
setting the active.

40
00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:19.731
So one for setting active song, singular,
one for setting active songs, plural.

41
00:02:19.731 --> 00:02:22.296
So we'll say, playSongs.

42
00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:29.342
I'll call it playSongs, and this is
gonna be useStoreActions, like this.

43
00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:32.646
It's a hook,
it's going to take a callback,

44
00:02:32.646 --> 00:02:35.372
you're get the store as an argument.

45
00:02:35.372 --> 00:02:37.423
Now all we gotta do is just
return the action that we want.

46
00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:46.188
So for this one, I want to get
the store.changeActiveSongs, like that.

47
00:02:46.188 --> 00:02:48.683
So I wanna get that action.

48
00:02:48.683 --> 00:02:52.747
And it's gonna freak out because
TypeScript, so I'm gonna any that.

49
00:02:52.747 --> 00:02:53.950
So this is the plural one,

50
00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.364
I just want to get that changeActiveSongs
thing that we made in our store.

51
00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:00.340
So if I go back to our store,
just as a refresher,

52
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.749
we made this changeActiveSongs here.

53
00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:05.963
So I'm getting a reference to this
function, which, if you remember,

54
00:03:05.963 --> 00:03:07.438
it just takes in a list of songs and

55
00:03:07.438 --> 00:03:10.356
sets the active songs to that list
of songs, that's all it does.

56
00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:17.604
Then I'm gonna do the same thing for
the singular, setting an active song,

57
00:03:17.604 --> 00:03:20.621
and I'm just gonna call
this setActiveSong.

58
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.453
And this one's just literally
getting rid of this.

59
00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:37.525
Okay, so now that we have that,

60
00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:43.276
all we have to do now is just
attach this to some handler.

61
00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:45.600
So I'm just gonna make
a function called handlePlay.

62
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.712
So when you click the play button or
you click a song,

63
00:03:47.712 --> 00:03:50.080
it's gonna run the handlePlay function.

64
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.126
And it's just going to set the active song
and the active songs, so the playlist.

65
00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:59.479
So let's say const handlePlay, and

66
00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:04.347
play is going to take in an active song,
optionally,

67
00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:11.181
cuz maybe you did click on the song,
maybe you clicked on the green button.

68
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:14.806
So it's optional if you
pass an active song or not.

69
00:04:14.806 --> 00:04:18.429
And then what it's going to
do is to set those things.

70
00:04:18.429 --> 00:04:22.868
So first it's going to set the active
song so whatever song you passed in,

71
00:04:22.868 --> 00:04:23.591
if you did.

72
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:28.899
If you did not, we're gonna set it to
the songs that we get in our props, 0.

73
00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:31.878
So the first thing in there, so
start the playlist at the top.

74
00:04:31.878 --> 00:04:35.910
If you did not click on the song,
instead you clicked on the green button,

75
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.045
then start at the top,
play the first thing in this list.

76
00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:43.020
But also we're going to set
the active songs to all the songs, so

77
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.498
this entire playlist.

78
00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:59.574
Then just hook up the handlers for
the two places where you might click.

79
00:04:59.574 --> 00:05:03.299
The first one is gonna be on this
big button, so we'll say onClick.

80
00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:05.331
If someone clicks this button,

81
00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:10.972
then we just wanna call handlePlay,
With no argument.

82
00:05:10.972 --> 00:05:12.535
But if we pass it in like this,

83
00:05:12.535 --> 00:05:16.489
we're gonna get a bug because it's
gonna pass in the event as an argument.

84
00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:19.668
But it's gonna think that event is
an active song, it's gonna set it and

85
00:05:19.668 --> 00:05:21.503
now we're gonna have a bunch of trouble.

86
00:05:21.503 --> 00:05:24.396
So we're going to just proxy
this with a callback and

87
00:05:24.396 --> 00:05:26.383
then call it without any argument.

88
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:39.382
And then lastly,
we're just going to add the onClick for

89
00:05:39.382 --> 00:05:43.828
the table, the whole table row,
I think, for

90
00:05:43.828 --> 00:05:47.025
each song, Tr, where's it at?

91
00:05:47.025 --> 00:05:48.073
Yeah, this thing right here.

92
00:05:48.073 --> 00:05:51.093
So for each Tr here,
we're gonna add onClick, and

93
00:05:51.093 --> 00:05:52.998
we're gonna do the same thing.

94
00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:56.550
We're just gonna say onClick, and then
we're gonna pass in a song in this case,

95
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.709
so we'll just pass
an anonymous function here.

96
00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:03.236
We'll say handlePlay, and then we'll pass
in the current song that we're iterating

97
00:06:03.236 --> 00:06:05.478
over, so that means you clicked on a song.

98
00:06:12.572 --> 00:06:16.466
And I wanna change this to pointer,
I don't know why it cursor="cursor",

99
00:06:16.466 --> 00:06:18.297
it should be cursor="pointer".

100
00:06:18.297 --> 00:06:19.321
There we go.

101
00:06:27.525 --> 00:06:32.931
Okay, so now we got that,
we can now go into our player bar and

102
00:06:32.931 --> 00:06:39.406
pull in the state and then we'll just
pass it down as a prop to the player.

103
00:06:39.406 --> 00:06:42.903
And that way we can actually toggle
whether we want to show the player or

104
00:06:42.903 --> 00:06:45.581
not if the song is active,
that way we can do it there.

105
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:48.688
So what we'll do is head
over to the PlayerBar, and

106
00:06:48.688 --> 00:06:53.337
we'll pull in the state here, so
we'll import some stuff from Easy Peasy.

107
00:06:56.601 --> 00:07:04.180
And we're gonna import a useStore,
pretty sure it's just gonna be useStore.

108
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.496
And like I said,
all we're gonna do is is get the states,

109
00:07:06.496 --> 00:07:07.763
we don't need anything else.

110
00:07:07.763 --> 00:07:10.254
And we wanna get it here
versus getting it in a player.

111
00:07:10.254 --> 00:07:13.904
Because like I said,
we wanna be able to toggle whether or

112
00:07:13.904 --> 00:07:18.010
not we show the player controls and
have to load up Holler.js and

113
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.210
all that stuff unless there's
an active song in the first place.

114
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.963
And actually, I think it's useStoreState,
that's what it's called.

115
00:07:26.963 --> 00:07:29.952
So useStoreState, and then we're just
gonna go ahead and get the state.

116
00:07:29.952 --> 00:07:30.742
So I'll say songs.

117
00:07:30.742 --> 00:07:36.674
That's gonna equal useStoreState,
like that.

118
00:07:36.674 --> 00:07:39.280
And it too takes a callback within state.

119
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.402
And I'm gonna any.

120
00:07:41.402 --> 00:07:45.349
And for songs,
it's just gonna be state.activeSongs,

121
00:07:45.349 --> 00:07:47.611
that's what we had in the store.

122
00:07:47.611 --> 00:07:50.049
That's all we gotta do,
got the active songs.

123
00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:56.140
And then for the singular active song,
we're just gonna call it activeSong.

124
00:07:59.897 --> 00:08:02.709
And we're just gonna take away the s,
there we go.

125
00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:05.482
That's it.

126
00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.145
So now we need to fulfill a couple things.

127
00:08:17.145 --> 00:08:19.677
One, we got to pass in
the props to the Player.

128
00:08:19.677 --> 00:08:21.602
It wants some songs.

129
00:08:21.602 --> 00:08:24.478
So we'll pass in some songs here,
we got those.

130
00:08:24.478 --> 00:08:25.788
And it also wants an active song.

131
00:08:25.788 --> 00:08:27.570
So we'll pass that in as well.

132
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.649
So we got those.

133
00:08:32.649 --> 00:08:34.394
And then we're gonna do some conditionals.

134
00:08:34.394 --> 00:08:38.746
One, I don't wanna render this artist
Box that shows the name of the song and

135
00:08:38.746 --> 00:08:41.067
the artist if there's no song playing.

136
00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:43.684
So I'm just gonna
conditionally render that.

137
00:08:43.684 --> 00:08:48.949
And I'm just gonna say, well,
is there an active song or not?

138
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:49.820
Is there an active song?

139
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:53.957
If so, cool, yeah, we'll render this.

140
00:08:53.957 --> 00:08:56.929
If not, then just null,
and don't render anything

141
00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:11.991
And we'll do the same thing with the
player, we'll conditionally render this,

142
00:09:11.991 --> 00:09:13.358
is there an active song?

143
00:09:13.358 --> 00:09:19.050
If so, render that, if not,
then null, don't render anything.

144
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.692
And it look like its working,

145
00:09:20.692 --> 00:09:24.315
all of our control disappear
because we don't have active song.

146
00:09:24.315 --> 00:09:27.510
Which is exactly what we expected,
but now if I click on one of these,

147
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.540
if I click this play button,
it should set the active song state,

148
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:32.430
which should put something on the page.

149
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:36.885
So if I click this, you can see,
I clicked on that, it brought it back.

150
00:09:36.885 --> 00:09:41.560
If I refresh and I click on a song,
it also brings it back.

151
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.852
So we know that it's picking up the state,
Easy Peasy's working,

152
00:09:44.852 --> 00:09:46.481
the state's being propagated.

153
00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:48.882
We're reading the state,
the conditionals are working.

154
00:09:48.882 --> 00:09:53.531
So now we just got to not
hard code this song name and

155
00:09:53.531 --> 00:09:56.540
not hard code this artist name.

156
00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.216
So the way we do that is
right here in the PlayerBar,

157
00:09:59.216 --> 00:10:02.035
let's get rid of where it
says Song Name in this text.

158
00:10:02.035 --> 00:10:06.600
And we'll just say activeSong.name.

159
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.227
And for Artist Name, it'll be activeSong.

160
00:10:14.263 --> 00:10:17.135
Artist.name.

161
00:10:20.216 --> 00:10:22.020
Cool, so if I click on this,

162
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:26.626
you can see that it shows the current
active song and the artist, there.

163
00:10:33.252 --> 00:10:38.014
The other way we could have handled this
state was just using some hooks with

164
00:10:38.014 --> 00:10:41.281
a useContext and a provider and
made our own thing.

165
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:46.828
But like I said,
it usually leads to performance issues.

166
00:10:46.828 --> 00:10:51.190
You get to the point where it's like,
wow if you open the React Dev Tools, and

167
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:54.548
it'll show you what is rendering and
why it's rendering,

168
00:10:54.548 --> 00:10:57.189
you'll always see some
context thing there.

169
00:10:57.189 --> 00:10:58.217
You'll like,

170
00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:02.211
everything is re-rendering because one
thing in the context thing changed.

171
00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:04.301
So you have to write a very specific way.

172
00:11:04.301 --> 00:11:05.819
I think it's just not worth it.

173
00:11:05.819 --> 00:11:10.031
And then what's next is to
actually play some music.

174
00:11:10.031 --> 00:11:14.340
So now that we actually have a song
coming in on the player, we have songs,

175
00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.762
we have activeSong,
we can actually play some stuff now.

176
00:11:17.762 --> 00:11:20.442
So we should be able to
uncomment out this ReactHowler.

177
00:11:20.442 --> 00:11:25.319
So what we'll do is the first thing is
we'll uncomment, like I said, ReactHowler,

178
00:11:25.319 --> 00:11:28.047
and we'll try to get all
of this stuff working.

179
00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:32.922
So let me get rid of the sidebar,
come here, save this.

180
00:11:32.922 --> 00:11:36.171
So right now we got the activeSong,
got the URL,

181
00:11:36.171 --> 00:11:38.797
playing is set to whatever playing is.

182
00:11:38.797 --> 00:11:42.273
I think that might be the default that
we need, let's see if it renders.

183
00:11:42.273 --> 00:11:46.172
If not,
we gotta fulfill all the other stuff.

184
00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:48.489
So I'm gonna refresh this.

185
00:11:48.489 --> 00:11:49.696
Actually, mine is already playing.

186
00:11:49.696 --> 00:11:51.912
I wonder if you can hear.

187
00:11:51.912 --> 00:11:54.167
[MUSIC]

188
00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:56.036
Cuz playing was set to true.

189
00:11:56.036 --> 00:12:02.067
So I refresh and
then I'm gonna click on a song, elevator.

190
00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:05.341
[MUSIC]

191
00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:09.613
Okay, yeah, so if you just render the
ReactHowler with the minimal playing set

192
00:12:09.613 --> 00:12:12.736
to the playing state and and
that active song URL in there,

193
00:12:12.736 --> 00:12:14.166
it should start playing.

194
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:14.899
None of the seeking or

195
00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:17.195
any of that stuff is going to work
because we didn't hook it up yet.

196
00:12:17.195 --> 00:12:21.649
So if you expect to see this moving or
that to be right, it's not.

197
00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:23.217
We gotta do that next.

198
00:12:23.217 --> 00:12:26.910
That's the hard part coming up next,
but it should play.
