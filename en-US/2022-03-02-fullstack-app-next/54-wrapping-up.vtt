1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.976
All right, and that's basically what
I wanted to cover in this course.

2
00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:07.936
I set out what I wanted to achieve, I hope
everyone that attended the course that's

3
00:00:07.936 --> 00:00:10.607
here that's watching live,
got some value from this.

4
00:00:10.607 --> 00:00:14.960
They've learned how someone
today would build a full stack

5
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.411
app using tools like React and
Node and Postgres and Vercel.

6
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:22.991
This is literally how I would do it if I
got hired today at some company that said

7
00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:25.540
hey, we need you to build up
your employee number one.

8
00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.143
We need you to built this from
scratch that's in full stack web app,

9
00:00:28.143 --> 00:00:29.110
this is how I would do it.

10
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.804
I would literally do it just like this, I
wouldn't think twice about anything else.

11
00:00:32.804 --> 00:00:38.036
So, these are the patterns and the tools
that I use that's my thought process,

12
00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:42.503
hopefully I was able to add some
value to your life some way somehow.

13
00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:46.535
If not if you feel like the way that I'm
doing things are not quite up to par,

14
00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:50.827
please let me know I'm willing to learn
and get better as well I'm not perfect.

15
00:00:50.827 --> 00:00:55.315
Especially now that I'm not even a full
time engineer writing code every day so,

16
00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:57.164
it just feels weird saying that.

17
00:00:57.164 --> 00:01:00.991
But yeah, I love these tools, I love these
technologies, I stay current as I can.

18
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:04.704
I still build things on the side, and
I still evaluate a lot of code as well.

19
00:01:04.704 --> 00:01:08.933
I'm actually looking at people's code
more than I actually write code now,

20
00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:12.264
because that's just part of diligence and
stuff like that.

21
00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:16.409
So yeah, hopefully this course was
something that, you learned from, and

22
00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.190
like I said before, feel free to go
in here and look at these designs.

23
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.680
I mean, there's just so much potential
that you can add to this app.

24
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.003
I mean, just from the UI side,
making it even tighter cleaning it up,

25
00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:33.626
down to the play bar with the images and
the volume controls.

26
00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:38.915
The whole favorite system, the creating
a playlist, the search functionality.

27
00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.913
Prisma actually has really good search
mechanisms built into it full text

28
00:01:42.913 --> 00:01:46.399
searching, full text search
looks like it's in preview mode.

29
00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.495
But yeah, they have full text search
where you can do things like that,

30
00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:52.040
it's really cool.

31
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.728
So yeah, you can add that search feature,
so if you're still okay, this was cool,

32
00:01:56.728 --> 00:01:58.668
but yeah I wanna go a little deeper.

33
00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:01.842
Keep going with this app just
keep making it keep building it,

34
00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:03.379
getting it to where you want.

35
00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:06.769
And if you wanna show off let
me know I would love to see it,

36
00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:09.537
send me a link on GitHub
put it on code sandbox.

37
00:02:09.537 --> 00:02:12.390
Send me a link that you
deployed to Vercel,

38
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.720
it doesn't matter I would love to see
what you got and yeah, thanks for coming.

39
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.402
