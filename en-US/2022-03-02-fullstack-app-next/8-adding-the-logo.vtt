1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.209
What I wanna do is basically,
just kinda muck some of this stuff up,

2
00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:07.156
obviously like these playlists, we haven't
gotten to the database and the data yet,

3
00:00:07.156 --> 00:00:10.044
so we're just mucksing these
playlists out till we get there.

4
00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:12.870
The navigation stuff is static,
it doesn't matter who you are.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.090
You're always gonna have the same links
here, so we're just gonna hardcode that.

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.050
But even then we are gonna hard code it,
I am not gonna hardcode into JSX.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.950
I still want this to be data driven,
even though it's static.

8
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.113
So what does that actually mean?

9
00:00:23.113 --> 00:00:24.180
l will show you,

10
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.921
but I don't really wanna hardcode into
JSX because it's gonna be a list.

11
00:00:28.921 --> 00:00:32.152
That means I'd have to write one, two,
three, four, five different things,

12
00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:33.530
when I could just write one thing,

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.540
cuz they're all the same thing with
different icons and different texts.

14
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.910
So you'll see what I mean by that.

15
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.570
So let's get started on the sidebar.

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.996
First thing we wanna do is create the
container for it and get the layout right,

17
00:00:46.996 --> 00:00:51.330
so I'm gonna return a box here,
which is basically a dev.

18
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.200
And let's give this thing a width.

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.482
So because the sidebar is rendered
inside of the player layout,

20
00:00:56.482 --> 00:00:59.276
which already has a box that
which already has a width,

21
00:00:59.276 --> 00:01:01.950
I want the sidebar to
be 100% of that parent.

22
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.104
So in order to do that,
I need to give it a width of 100%, so

23
00:01:05.104 --> 00:01:07.860
be 100% of your parent,
which is 250 pixels.

24
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.850
And from there,
I'll also need to calculate the height.

25
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.413
So let's think about the height for
a little bit.

26
00:01:15.413 --> 00:01:17.614
Typically, you don't have
to think about height,

27
00:01:17.614 --> 00:01:20.917
but because it's absolutely position,
we do have to think about height cuz we

28
00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:23.790
want it to be full length,
even though you might have 0 playlists.

29
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.200
We still wanted to go from top to bottom,
so we have to give it a height.

30
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.578
But there's a player bar at the bottom,
so we have to account for that.

31
00:01:31.578 --> 00:01:33.650
I remember us saying that
this was gonna be 100 pixels.

32
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.422
So I'm gonna account for
that by giving the height.

33
00:01:37.422 --> 00:01:42.039
I'm gonna use calc and
I'm gonna calculate this being 100

34
00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.140
view height minus the 100
pixels of the player bar.

35
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.728
So that's how I determine
how high that is.

36
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:56.847
And next thing is, I'm gonna give this
a background, I can just put bg for short,

37
00:01:56.847 --> 00:02:00.664
and I'm just gonna put black because
that's what it is in the design.

38
00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:03.719
I'm gonna add some padding to the left and
right,

39
00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.276
I can shortcode that by saying padding x.

40
00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:10.409
So on the x-axis, that's what
padding x is, it also has padding y.

41
00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.471
You can do padding, which is all four,
the padding x is left and right,

42
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.656
it's a shortcut for that.

43
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:19.615
And I'm just gonna play around with it,
so I'm gonna say 5 pixels,

44
00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:23.902
and then the color of the text
is gonna be great, like that.

45
00:02:23.902 --> 00:02:30.945
So now we have a box, that's got the width
of 100 height, all that good stuff.

46
00:02:30.945 --> 00:02:33.820
So now I'm gonna go back to our design,
and you can see, yeah,

47
00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.734
it did exactly what I
said it was gonna do.

48
00:02:35.734 --> 00:02:38.491
It's black, it's 250 pixels wide,

49
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:43.789
it's 100 view height tall minus 100
pixels of the player underneath it.

50
00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.650
So this is what the player is
going to render right here.

51
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.586
So that's why there's that space
here cuz we did 100 view height,

52
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.670
which is the full height of
the screen minus 100 pixels.

53
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.500
So far, this is doing exactly
what we wanted it to do.

54
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.520
It's looking pretty good.

55
00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.228
And you can see that the color is gray for
the text here.

56
00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:04.140
You can see I have the word js in there,
and it is indeed great.

57
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.770
If you're still trying to get the imports,
don't worry about it.

58
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.777
You'll import them as we start using them.

59
00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:10.774
The VS code auto imports
most of this stuff, so

60
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.460
you don't have to type them all in.

61
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.540
I just wanted to narrate on why
we had these in the first place.

62
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.179
Typically, I wouldn't type them in all the
top either cuz I don't even know I need

63
00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.310
them until I'm writing the JSX anyway,
so that's just the process.

64
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.876
Okay, so let's get cracking with this.

65
00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:28.639
The next thing we're gonna do is
we're gonna make a another box here.

66
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.670
Like I said, boxes are just divs.

67
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.366
This first box is basically just gonna be
like if you think of the one that we just

68
00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:39.670
made, that's the shell,
that's the container.

69
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.544
Now, this next box is gonna be where
all the content lives, that way,

70
00:03:42.544 --> 00:03:43.589
we can separate the two.

71
00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:48.020
If we ever need to do padding for all the
content at once, it's just really great to

72
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.530
have this outer div that's the layout and
have an inner div that's the content.

73
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.790
And that way, they're separate.

74
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.851
Whereas if you just put all your children
inside of the layout, and you wanna add

75
00:03:56.851 --> 00:04:00.300
some padding, you have to add padding
to each one of those individually.

76
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.585
Whereas you could just add
it to the content div and

77
00:04:02.585 --> 00:04:04.174
all of them will see that padding.

78
00:04:04.174 --> 00:04:06.370
So typically,
that's just the way I like to do it.

79
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.572
Yes, it adds extra divs in
places like that, but it's so

80
00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:11.595
much easier to style in my opinion.

81
00:04:13.744 --> 00:04:15.420
So we're gonna have this box here.

82
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.430
We're gonna put some paddingY,
which is top and bottom.

83
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.128
And let's play around with this number.

84
00:04:21.128 --> 00:04:24.280
We'll do 20 pixels.

85
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.993
That's gonna be the padding on the top and
padding on the bottom.

86
00:04:26.993 --> 00:04:31.419
And then the next thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna make a div for

87
00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.360
the image that goes here,
this logo here, so we need to make some.

88
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.600
That's the next div we're gonna make for
this logo here.

89
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.260
So we're gonna do that.

90
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.490
So I'm gonna make another box.

91
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.640
Like I said, these nested divs.

92
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.509
And we'll give this a width of, again, you
kinda gotta play around with this number,

93
00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.894
whatever feels right,
you have those design tools,

94
00:04:50.894 --> 00:04:54.490
they'll tell you the exact
pixels that the designer made.

95
00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.517
We're gonna do some margin bottom
cuz there are space underneath it,

96
00:04:58.517 --> 00:05:02.420
of like 20 pixels, and then a paddingX,
which is left and right.

97
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.950
20 pixels is well, so we'll do that.

98
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.005
And then I'm gonna import
something from NextJS,

99
00:05:13.005 --> 00:05:17.530
I'm gonna call it NextImage
from 'next/image', and

100
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.450
it's just the image component
that's optimized by NextJS.

101
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.928
They do tons of optimizations on the image
as far as like compression, and they allow

102
00:05:27.928 --> 00:05:32.803
you to hook into a CMS and add a query
string too and do a bunch of crazy stuff.

103
00:05:32.803 --> 00:05:36.309
It's just, yeah, you should look it up,
it's pretty insane.

104
00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:42.830
We're gonna be using NextImage to actually
add our logo, so I'm gonna say NextImage.

105
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.410
If I can spell, there we go.

106
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.720
It's actually a self closing tag.

107
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.283
So we'll do it like that.

108
00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:55.150
And then we're gonna give it a source and
we'll get the image in a minute.

109
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.190
And then what we're gonna
do is give it a height.

110
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.962
I'm gonna say 60 and
a width of double that, so

111
00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:05.001
it looks like a rectangle, so 120.

112
00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:11.276
And then as far as where we're
gonna get the image from,

113
00:06:11.276 --> 00:06:13.858
if you head over to the notion,
if you scroll down,

114
00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:17.110
there should be a little
logo here that says Trax.

115
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.160
That's the image.

116
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.824
That's the logo,
I actually made that logo.

117
00:06:20.824 --> 00:06:25.559
So if anybody needs logos design,
I'm charging, let me know.

118
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:29.816
So we're gonna download this and

119
00:06:29.816 --> 00:06:34.232
I'm just gonna just call it Trax.

120
00:06:34.232 --> 00:06:36.306
I'm just gonna call it logo and
call it whatever you want.

121
00:06:36.306 --> 00:06:41.497
So I'm gonna download this,
put this in my downloads folder, and

122
00:06:41.497 --> 00:06:47.352
then I'm gonna go back to my code,
open up finder again, go to downloads.

123
00:06:47.352 --> 00:06:48.796
I must trust you.

124
00:06:48.796 --> 00:06:51.296
If I'm pulling my downloads
folder in front of all y'all,

125
00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:53.553
that means I trust you cuz
that's dangerous, okay?

126
00:06:53.553 --> 00:06:57.914
Cuz you have no idea what's in someone's
download folder, that's kind of scary.

127
00:06:57.914 --> 00:07:01.722
So I'm gonna grab this logo, and it's
important that you put it in the public

128
00:07:01.722 --> 00:07:05.400
folder on the root of the project,
it must go into public folder.

129
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.890
So I'm gonna drag it there.

130
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.750
You shouldn't have to
optimize any of this SVG,

131
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:15.440
I'm pretty sure I already cleaned up
the fixed width and fixed height on it.

132
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.621
So then as far as adding the logo,
all we have to do is just say slash, and

133
00:07:18.621 --> 00:07:21.290
then the name of the file,
which in this case, logo.svg.

134
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:22.941
So I'll save that.

135
00:07:26.756 --> 00:07:29.880
And if we can't see it,
it's probably cuz it's black.

136
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.079
So let's go check it out, no, that's fine.

137
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:35.285
And there you go.
We have our logo,

138
00:07:35.285 --> 00:07:38.070
our nice custom Trax logo.

139
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.651
Yeah, so if you are looking at
this on a white background,

140
00:07:41.651 --> 00:07:45.100
you will not be able to see
this transparent white logo.

141
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.678
If you've never used those before,
if you don't know how to do this,

142
00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:49.781
you can go to notion.

143
00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:53.379
You can click on settings and
you can click on appearance so

144
00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:55.668
you can change the appearance here.

145
00:07:55.668 --> 00:08:01.660
Or you can just hover right after this
screenshot and before this screenshot.

146
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.387
It's right here,
it's just invisible, sorry.

147
00:08:04.387 --> 00:08:08.080
Any other questions on that?

148
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.160
&gt;&gt; Sorry, [INAUDIBLE] questions and maybe
it's just to dig into the next image.

149
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.070
But why are we setting the height and

150
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.600
the width not as in quotes,
I mean, the curly brace?

151
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great question.

152
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:23.213
The question was,
why are we not using height and

153
00:08:23.213 --> 00:08:27.690
width as we normally would with
styles up here, like this width?

154
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.560
Okay, so let's talk about this.

155
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.894
So with these components like box and
all these components in chakra,

156
00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:38.081
they have all the CSS properties
enumerated as react properties and

157
00:08:38.081 --> 00:08:40.700
you can use them however you want.

158
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.436
The next image component has no
affiliation with the chakra UI component

159
00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:49.070
lib, and
does not have the same functionality.

160
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.980
But they do happen to have the same
name as in height and width.

161
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:54.620
But if you look at the docs for
next image,

162
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:57.870
it actually prefers you to
just add in a value here.

163
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.750
In fact, it actually won't even work,
unless you put a value.

164
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:03.834
That's the only way they can optimize this
image if you tell it what the size of

165
00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:06.390
it is, and
that's how the optimization happens.

166
00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:09.563
And I would imagine they probably don't
care about pixels because they do

167
00:09:09.563 --> 00:09:11.260
that anyway, they just add it for you.

168
00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.173
But this is what the next image
documentation recommends,

169
00:09:14.173 --> 00:09:16.180
is doing it this way.

170
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:22.315
So yeah, you couldn't do all this really
cool stuff like this on this image.

171
00:09:22.315 --> 00:09:28.840
But I think maybe you might be able
to use SX on every single component.

172
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:34.110
But then TypeScript wouldn't like it,
yeah, so yeah, it's not chakra, basically.
