00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So so far we've coded
our name, our phone number, and

2
00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.300
email, some information.

3
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.750
And you see that at the top here,

4
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.300
we actually have a header that
says your contact information.

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.370
This is some information like that.

6
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.640
And then we have a second part of the form
that's gonna ask about how you'd like to

7
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.620
be abducted by aliens.

8
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.990
Okay?

9
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.110
So this is actually two parts of the form.

10
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.710
And one of the things that we can do
to set off these two parts of the form,

11
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.400
there is actually a tag for this and
it's called the field set tag and

12
00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.930
so let's go ahead and add a field set tag.

13
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.950
This will also help with accessibility.

14
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.810
It also helps with just
understanding the form in general,

15
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.760
when you look at the form,
you kind of go, you need information and

16
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.080
then you need to know about
my abduction experience.

17
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.470
And so it clearly breaks the form
into two chunks as you fill it out,

18
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.200
rather than I'm sure you've all seen this,
the form, the endless form that just goes

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.220
on forever and ever and you never know
what they're going to ask you next.

20
00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.160
And it's just kind of a bad experience.

21
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.220
So using fields set is a nice way to break
up your form into manageable chunks.

22
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.300
People kind of know what's coming.

23
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.578
So guess what the fields
set tag looks like.

24
00:01:10.753 --> 00:01:11.488
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Field set,

25
00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:16.690
sweet and it's going to start there
right after the forum tag in this case.

26
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.905
And where's this field
set tag going to end?

27
00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:21.660
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: At your abduction.

28
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:29.038
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just right before our
abduction information /fieldset, okay?

29
00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:34.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
you can indent everything.

30
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.330
What I just did is I highlighted all the
stuff from field set to slash field set

31
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.060
and then hit my tab key and
that indented everything one level, right?

32
00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.250
Once you have a field set in place,
just go ahead and save that.

33
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.610
Let's take a quick peek at that.

34
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.670
You'll see that puts a nice
little box around us.

35
00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:57.610
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our forum
is looking really ugly.

36
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.580
I have my name, my phone number and
my email address.

37
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.580
They are kinda wrapping around once again,
no sweat.

38
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.880
That's all good.

39
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.420
We'll fix it.

40
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.470
So the other thing that we like to add
with the field set is a label in, sorry,

41
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.040
not a label.

42
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.110
It's a legend.

43
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.850
And the legend is designed to say what
this field set is doing here, right?

44
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.070
So rather than an h2,
we're going to change that tag to legend.

45
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.084
Legend, your contact
information slash legend.

46
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:37.434
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And once you get
that in place and you refresh,

47
00:02:37.434 --> 00:02:41.610
you'll see here there's the words
your contact information.

48
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.220
And it's there's a little box going around
all of your contact information, okay?

49
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: So why is that better?

50
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.560
What does legend do?

51
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.760
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
legend is describing our fieldset.

52
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.350
So the fieldset is, this is a group and
then we needed sort of a title for

53
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.580
the fieldset and that's what the legend
tag is doing, serving as that title.

54
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.250
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Works hand
in hand with field set.

55
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.770
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Works hand
in hand with field set.

56
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.560
You'll never see legend
hanging out there by itself.

57
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.803
It's always inside of a field set.

58
00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:13.500
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Good.

59
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.920
Why don't you take two minutes now and
see if you can do the same thing,

60
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.160
field set in legend for the second part of
the forum about your abduction experience.

61
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.804
Go ahead and set up a field set and
a legend tag for about your experience.
