1
00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:06.178
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And if you scroll
on down here to the forms portion,

2
00:00:06.178 --> 00:00:10.680
this is item number six forms,
that is what we're doing today.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.590
And here on this webpage are all the files
that you're gonna need to follow along.

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.030
So go ahead and find that link there where
it says download the zip of the files.

5
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.409
Go ahead and click that.

6
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:27.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's
gonna put you onto GitHub.

7
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.120
Look for the button here that says
download, click the download button.

8
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.330
That's gonna go ahead and
download those forms files for you.

9
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.830
Those are usually put into
your downloads directory,

10
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.930
wherever that happens
to be on your computer.

11
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.011
Drag that to your desktop.

12
00:00:46.814 --> 00:00:50.374
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Double click on it and
order to try and zip it.

13
00:00:50.374 --> 00:00:53.250
And you'll have everything you need
to follow along today, all right?

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.925
Just like we did yesterday, so
click on the link for the zip file,

15
00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:06.319
download it,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Once you've downloaded it,

16
00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:10.671
drag it onto your desktop, unzip it, and
you have all the files that are there and

17
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:12.300
ready to go.

18
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.443
Then what we're going to do,
is we're gonna go to open up our VS code.

19
00:01:18.543 --> 00:01:20.826
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
we're gonna go ahead and

20
00:01:20.826 --> 00:01:23.971
drag our forms folder on top of VS code.

21
00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:31.761
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And that's gonna go
ahead and open up our new site and

22
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:35.600
there's two folders inside of
the one that you downloaded.

23
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.680
One is called begin and one is called end.

24
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.500
And shockingly begin is
the beginning state and

25
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.210
end is what we're gonna be coding today.

26
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.930
When you're all done,
that's where all of those files are.

27
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.080
So you can refer to those if you need to.

28
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:57.310
So go on ahead and
open up the begin folder and forms.html.

29
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.722
All right, so go on ahead and
open up forms.html.

30
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
you'll see that I have gone ahead and

31
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.420
giving you a starting state here for
your form.

32
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.882
And we'll go ahead and
put on our word wrap.

33
00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:15.620
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we'll go on ahead and
also open up forms.css.

34
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.450
Remember if you right click or
command click, over there,

35
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.590
on forms.css you can say
open to the side and

36
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.070
get the two columns here next to each
other and then I'm going to turn off,

37
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.570
my far left column, the explorer column,
with that icon at the top.

38
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.250
Get rid of that.

39
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.999
Make sure I got my word wrapping
on over here on my CSS.

40
00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:42.499
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

41
00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:46.810
So I've given you a little bit
of HTML to start with here.

42
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.310
Okay.

43
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.345
Just a little bit and
over here on this side under CSS,

44
00:02:52.345 --> 00:02:55.204
we have a little bit of
CSS to start us off and

45
00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:59.270
if you go head and just open that up and
your default browser.

46
00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:05.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here is our beginning form.

47
00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:08.787
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We are making
an alien abduction form,

48
00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:11.890
kind of goes with the blog
that we built yesterday.

49
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.310
All right, so
you can order up an alien abduction.

50
00:03:15.976 --> 00:03:22.160
All right, so as always, we're going to be
following along with our notes here today.

51
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.350
And just as always inside of the notes for

52
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.310
today's lesson, there's a whole bunch
of stuff here that you can refer to.

53
00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.850
This is how we're gonna
go about coding the form.

54
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.790
We're gonna be putting in a lot of
these different input types and so

55
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.630
forth as we code the form.

56
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.310
And so
if you get lost anywhere along the way, or

57
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.820
you need additional help, you can look
here to get that additional help.

58
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.585
All right, so let's go ahead and
get started here in our form.

59
00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:54.944
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One thing that's gonna be
useful here to work with this code today,

60
00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:58.351
remember how VS code has
got that closing tag thing,

61
00:03:58.351 --> 00:04:02.020
you start to type a tag and
it puts in a closing tag.

62
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.060
Okay, so for
Mac people go under the code menu,

63
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.940
look at preferences, and
then we're going to go to settings.

64
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.990
For Windows people, under file,
then preferences, then settings,

65
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:16.910
and you'll go to the same place.

66
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.901
So this is going to show
us the settings here.

67
00:04:20.584 --> 00:04:24.178
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So under your settings,
if you type in the top box on the top,

68
00:04:24.178 --> 00:04:26.364
you type in auto-closing tags, and

69
00:04:26.364 --> 00:04:31.720
you have the user settings selected, this
is gonna pull up a whole list of stuff.

70
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.780
And at the top here, where it says HTML,
it says auto-closing tags.

71
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.280
That's where that like you
type in a paragraph and

72
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.740
it immediately puts in slash P after it,
this is gonna turn that off, I think it'll

73
00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.280
make our life a little easier today,
so just go on ahead and turn that off.

74
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.640
Later on, if you wanna change this back,
you're more than welcome to do so,

75
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.720
just go on ahead and open up your settings
again, do exactly the same thing,

76
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.530
say auto closing tags and
then recheck the box, and

77
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.960
that will re-enable that
particular feature.

78
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.111
I don't think there's a save or
anything to click, just go ahead and

79
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.196
close that tab when you're done.
