00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.300
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have one last type of
field to add here to our form all the way

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.140
down on the bottom.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.800
[COUGH]
Add me to your email list,

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.540
everybody's favorite.

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.560
So we're gonna go ahead and
add something here.

6
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.120
Anybody have any suggestion?

7
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.180
How are email,
when it says add me to your email list,

8
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.860
how is that usually handled on a form?

9
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.980
Yeah
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A checkbox.

10
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Usually
it's a checkbox right?

11
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.092
So we can make a checkbox for this.

12
00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:31.825
So input type=checkbox

13
00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:43.633
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And we'll go ahead and

14
00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:50.787
give it a value of subscribe,

15
00:00:50.787 --> 00:00:56.796
and a name of subscribe,

16
00:00:56.796 --> 00:01:02.530
and an ID of subscribe.

17
00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.365
Add me to your email list.

18
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.386
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody want
that check by default?

19
00:01:11.386 --> 00:01:15.446
Don't you love it when you're filling
out a form and you miss the little check

20
00:01:15.446 --> 00:01:19.220
box to uncheck it so
that you're automatically subscribed?

21
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.820
We totally wanna do that, right?

22
00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.860
We want everyone to subscribe by default,
they have to uncheck it, okay?

23
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.000
What might I add here to my input type
to make the people subscribe by default?

24
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Checks.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about checked?

25
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.980
Exactly the same as the radio button.

26
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.260
The checked property will
make it checked by default.

27
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.082
Silly, unsuspecting people,
they're going to have to uncheck it.

28
00:01:47.677 --> 00:01:52.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, now, in terms of
the text that goes with this particular

29
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.846
checkbox, usually the checkbox
comes first right and

30
00:01:55.846 --> 00:01:59.720
the text comes after which
is what we have here.

31
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.560
So this paragraph where it says
add me to your email list,

32
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.310
we don't need that, that can go away.

33
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.080
But what do we need when we have an input
like this and the text right next to it?

34
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.410
What do we still need to have?

35
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.740
A label tag around the whole thing.

36
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.322
Label and

37
00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:22.696
slash label.

38
00:02:29.044 --> 00:02:34.996
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] And if you go ahead
and save that, refresh your web page.

39
00:02:36.907 --> 00:02:39.260
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There it is,
add me to your email list.

40
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.121
I have to uncheck it,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In order to not be

41
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:43.839
subscribed.

42
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.730
Yes.

43
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.515
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why is there an ID in
that last input when there's not a for

44
00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:52.610
in the label?

45
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Probably
because I just added it.

46
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.370
You should just take it out.

47
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.370
You can take it out,
you don't actually have to have that.

48
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.330
You have to have the ID if you're
going to have to put it in the label.

49
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.680
When the label tag goes around
the whole unit like this,

50
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.192
you don't have to have that for
thing going on.

51
00:03:10.192 --> 00:03:14.568
But up in these where we have,

52
00:03:14.568 --> 00:03:19.790
sorry, up in these where we have

53
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.390
the actual label separated
from the actual widget,

54
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.820
you need that connection of ID and
for but down here where we've got our

55
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.560
thing together as a unit,
you can just use the plain old label tag.
