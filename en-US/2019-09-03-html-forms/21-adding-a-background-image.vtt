00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.847
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So let's do some stuff to
make that look a little bit prettier.

2
00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:07.400
I'm gonna go ahead and
open up my CSS file.

3
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.129
If you don't already have it open,
you may wanna go ahead and have it open.

4
00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.430
And I'm gonna tell you about some
styling that I did for this.

5
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.640
And it explain to you what I did.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.120
And you can do whatever you want
with your styling for your forms.

7
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.730
Pretty much styling works
the same way everywhere.

8
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.570
You have a whole bunch of new HTML
elements here you haven't seen before.

9
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.850
But styling them works exactly
the same way as every other HTML

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.260
element you work with to
this point in the course.

11
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.525
So you can just go through here, and for
example, add an input as a selector.

12
00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:47.650
And you can style all of your
input types in a certain way.

13
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.370
So I'm just gonna go on ahead and show
you a few things that are going on here.

14
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.210
So in our document In our CSS,
let me get my word wrap on.

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.730
You'll notice that we
have our wrapper here.

16
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.223
So our wrapper is 80% wide,
and the margin is 0 auto,

17
00:01:08.223 --> 00:01:14.980
and we also have it as display flex,
and the flex-flow is row nowrap.

18
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.580
Then we have our section and
aside there next to each other.

19
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.143
So, the flex basis is 57%,
we've got a margin on the right of 10%.

20
00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:28.770
And then we have a flex-basis of 33% for
the other part of the page.

21
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.980
So roughly one or
two-thirds of the page is the form.

22
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.338
One-third of the page is that
additional column, that's good.

23
00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:39.150
Eventually, we're gonna put a map
over there on the side, okay?

24
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.670
And so that's where the current styling is
coming from, from that particular form.

25
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.810
That's why this is showing up over here.

26
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.570
That's why we have the form
showing up over here on this side.

27
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.080
Everybody good with what we've
got over here at the moment?

28
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.320
We have a little spacing going on in here,
a little bit of margin stuff going on.

29
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.540
But we don't really have any other
stuff happening in terms of styling.

30
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.240
So I'm gonna show you a cool little trick
that makes your web pages look kinda fun.

31
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.272
We've been working a lot
with place-kitten, and

32
00:02:14.272 --> 00:02:18.380
a lot of you love having the kittens for
background images.

33
00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.700
Well, kittens don't go in space,
they just can't fit into a spacesuit.

34
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.450
I do have for you here, in your files we
do have an image that's available to you.

35
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.371
It's called galaxy.jpg, and I'm gonna
set this as the background for my

36
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:40.180
whole body of this web page, and because
that seemed like a good picture to use.

37
00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.400
Thank you NASA.

38
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.863
So all we have to do is here in the body
tag, we wanna add a background image.

39
00:02:46.863 --> 00:02:48.209
So what do I put here?

40
00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:55.468
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Background-image,
and then we're

41
00:02:55.468 --> 00:03:00.300
gonna say, url is going to be, what?

42
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.048
Pop quiz, yes, Jenna?

43
00:03:06.048 --> 00:03:10.197
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's like img/galaxy.jpg.

44
00:03:10.197 --> 00:03:16.120
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Galaxy.jpg,
okay, is this correct?

45
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.450
The answer is, it's probably not
gonna work, but let's test it.

46
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.570
Let's test it, we refresh the page.

47
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.070
It quote doesn't work.

48
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.620
Why doesn't it work?

49
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.110
What is this url saying?

50
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.820
Where are we currently in
our directory structure?

51
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.685
Where are we currently in our files and
folders, okay?

52
00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:40.090
We're here in forms.css, right?

53
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.970
What do I need to do?

54
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.140
I need to go out of the CSS folder.

55
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.150
So that's 1../, right?

56
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:52.210
Then go into the img folder,
and into galaxy.jpg, correct?

57
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.311
Okay, so we got to have a ../
in front of img, there we go.

58
00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.631
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so now when
we refresh, my God, it's full of stars.
