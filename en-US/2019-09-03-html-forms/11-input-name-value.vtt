WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then for every option
there's gonna be a value, value=.

2
00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.540
And that value is whatever you wanna
call it based on what you see there in

3
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.540
the text.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:16.880
So I call this one the tour,
here I'd like a tour of the solar system.

5
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.035
Value= dinner,
you wanna do alien dinner and

6
00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:28.806
discussion, value= dance,

7
00:00:28.806 --> 00:00:32.930
alien dance lessons.

8
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.090
And then of course,

9
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.560
the very popular whale-watching,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Whales.

10
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.630
So let's just take a look at
what we have here so far.

11
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.360
We go ahead and save that, and

12
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.430
then take a look at that here in
your web browser for your form.

13
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.530
And once again, don't worry about
the formatting, it's a mess.

14
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.660
I hear you, it's a mess,
we're gonna fix it.

15
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.420
So what type of alien abduction
experience do you want?

16
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.110
You'll see that we have our little
select list right here, and

17
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.876
we can switch this to whatever we want,
okay?

18
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.900
Is anyone bothered by the fact
that it starts off, right away,

19
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810
just by saying tour of the solar system?

20
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.680
Anyone bothered by that?

21
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.840
Yeah, what does it normally say on
these kind of selects when you see

22
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.710
these on the web?

23
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Select.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's says, select one or

24
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.010
something, right?

25
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.750
So we can add that,
how might we go about adding that?

26
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.569
Anyone have an idea, yeah?

27
00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:33.910
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: We add another option.

28
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Add another option,
exactly.

29
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.090
So what we're going to
do is we're gonna say,

30
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.470
[COUGH]
option, and then we can say,

31
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.550
you can give this a value if you want, but
I'm actually gonna leave my value out.

32
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.841
I don't want people picking this
as an option, [LAUGH] okay?

33
00:01:53.841 --> 00:01:58.540
There's gonna be no value, but
I will add this, selected.

34
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.340
Because this is what's gonna
be selected by default.

35
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.047
And then I can type in select one,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Oops, /option.

36
00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.623
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we can add that
to the top of our choices here.

37
00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:25.556
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And once you've done that,
[COUGH] you can save your form,

38
00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:29.162
and then go ahead and refresh the page.

39
00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:33.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make sure
you save your HTML.

40
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.089
I saved my HTML.

41
00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:44.060
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I must have
selected this already.

42
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.878
There we go, select one.

43
00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.680
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

44
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.560
So there we go, you should have a select
one there at the top of the list.

45
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.170
Did it work?

46
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.090
More or less?

47
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.330
Okay, yes?

48
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.210
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So I need another rundown on
the difference between id, name and value.

49
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.130
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, id,
name, and value three things.

50
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.750
And in the context of which of these fine

51
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.102
types of form fields that
we've been talking about.

52
00:03:16.102 --> 00:03:19.500
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I mean,
it seems just unintuitive.

53
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.433
Okay, if you have an input and
some input types, you need an id and

54
00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.680
a name, but also a value on these options.

55
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.800
We just have a value.

56
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.180
How do you know when to
use one of the other,

57
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.730
when do you what do you
always have to have?

58
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.710
What do you-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.

59
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.470
Right, right.I think I actually
forgot to put in the name up here so

60
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.710
maybe that will help you.

61
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.050
Name equals AB type.

62
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.890
Sorry, so that'll probably help you.You'll
need a name up there in the select.

63
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.140
So, okay, so what Emma's pointing out here
is there's a little bit of inconsistency.

64
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.140
So the thing to remember about this
is the following, ID, right, ID.

65
00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.750
Is for the label tag.

66
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.370
That's why we have it here in HTML and
CSS.

67
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.170
The only reason that we put an ID into
a form, it's to work with the label tag.

68
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.160
Okay, and the value of ID and the value of
for the for attribute in the label tag.

69
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.759
They have to be the same, right?

70
00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.700
Always 100% of the time.

71
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.100
Okay?
IDs and four they go together.

72
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.180
The name is for back end processing.

73
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.900
Okay?

74
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.480
Name is for back end processing.

75
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.780
And that's what that is there for.

76
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.400
And value is the one that's gonna vary But
value is of course, the actual values.

77
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.040
Remember we talked about
property value pairs in CSS,

78
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.020
like border, one pixel solid red?

79
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.960
Remember that whole thing?

80
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.860
Name and value are the same kinda thing.

81
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.440
The property is name and
the value is whatever it is.

82
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.010
Make sense?

83
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.970
Okay, so if we go scroll all
the way back on up here and

84
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.310
we take a look at let's say for
example name all right?

85
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.460
Name is actually a box, we have no idea
what people's names are, we can account

86
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.400
for 7 billion people on this planet and
all their individual names, right?

87
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.750
Nor would we want to.

88
00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.220
So we give you a box and

89
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.500
whatever you type in the box,
that is going to be the value, right?

90
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.210
So the name of the Name field or the name,

91
00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.880
the name property of phone or something,
whatever you type in that box.

92
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.290
That is the value.

93
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.146
Make sense?

94
00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:38.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Thing under value.

95
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.730
So it's like a key value pair.

96
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.060
The name is the key,
the value is the value.

97
00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.890
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Or in like a spreadsheet,
the name is the header row and

98
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.010
the value is the value in itself.

99
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.190
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct, yeah,
yeah, so that's true for

100
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.060
these things where you're
typing something in, right?

101
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.820
But in the case of a radio button,
for example, or for

102
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.150
a select box,
there's nothing to type in, right?

103
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.240
So somehow,
we still need to transmit a value.

104
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.260
And so that's why we have a value property
here for radio buttons and select boxes.

105
00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.600
Also for check boxes,
which we'll get to in a minute.

106
00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.430
Does that help some?

107
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.170
Great question.

108
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.710
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What was the last thing

109
00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.760
that you typed in i
missed you noticed you.

110
00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Name there
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

111
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.190
So for the Select,
i forgot the name, sorry.

112
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.990
So iI put in, here's the ID app type.

113
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.320
That's for the label.

114
00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.300
The name is for the backend processing.

115
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.610
That's apptype.

116
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.260
Then the value in this case those
are right there in those tax

117
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.820
in the drop down the option tax, thank
you for continuing to ask that question.

118
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.640
Ask it again.

119
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.930
If you still don't understand
this is like really important.

120
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.200
If you don't understand this stuff,
your forms not gonna work, right?

121
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Get a couple more times.

122
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.820
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
She's gonna ask you a few more times.

123
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.620
That's great.

124
00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:57.240
No problem, no problem at all.
