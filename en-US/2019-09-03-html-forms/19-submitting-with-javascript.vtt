00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is
okay user experience.

2
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.060
But it feels kind of odd to
suddenly go on to a page like

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.660
this that's completely blank with
just this tiny little bit of text on.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.010
Wouldn't it be nice if we actually
stayed on the web page itself?

5
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.600
And maybe it could give me a message that,
the message was sent or

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.440
that something was required, and maybe
a few more words to make it sound a little

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.235
bit more polite and nice, other than these
very terse messages that we we have here,

8
00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.545
that are coming from the script itself.

9
00:00:30.545 --> 00:00:34.825
So Lanie has written us a scrip
that is going to display for

10
00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:37.595
us those error messages in
a much nicer sort of way and

11
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:41.185
handle submitting that
information to the server.

12
00:00:41.185 --> 00:00:44.265
And so, to include that
JavaScript on our web page,

13
00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:46.235
I've given you the little
snippet of code here.

14
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.540
Later on in this course,
when Brian Holt takes over and

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.290
starts to talk about JavaScript,
you'll learn much more

16
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.630
about how to write scripts like this and
how to include them in your web page.

17
00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.850
But for right now this is what you need,

18
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.680
this little tag it's
called the script tag.

19
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.490
And there's a source associated with it,
just like there is for an image tag.

20
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.060
So this is a way of connecting that
JavaScript file into your HTML.

21
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.480
Typically JavaScript links like this will
either go in the head of the document, or

22
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.970
they'll go down just below

23
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.640
the very bottom of the document just
before the body of the document closes and

24
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.460
often the developer will
specify where this needs to go.

25
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.410
And so this is going to go down
at the bottom of the web page.

26
00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.040
So let's go ahead and place that there.

27
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.480
So scroll all the way down in your HTML
to just before the slash body tag.

28
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.480
And you can go ahead and
paste that script in place.

29
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.310
Make sure you have that
script available to you.

30
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.460
It should be in your begin folder,
you should find a folder called JS and

31
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.889
you should find a file called
forms.js inside of that.

32
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.680
So that would be something that
would cause it not to work,

33
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.072
if you have it in a different place.

34
00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:58.920
Go on ahead and save that.

35
00:02:01.782 --> 00:02:03.777
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
now when we refresh the web page.

36
00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:08.196
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now we should
be able to go on ahead and

37
00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:13.078
order our abduction experience and you'll
see here that we have a much nicer dialog

38
00:02:13.078 --> 00:02:17.350
box in the page that says the order
has been received, check your email.

39
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.630
And if for example,
I hadn't entered an email address and

40
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.230
tried to submit this form, I could get
an error message that looks like this.

41
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.486
We have a problem,
please provide your email address.

42
00:02:31.477 --> 00:02:34.501
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So hopefully that
worked out okay for you as well, so

43
00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:39.039
that is how we're going to go about adding
some processing to our form script to

44
00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.320
actually make it do something.

45
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.396
Now go check your email and
see what you sent yourself.
