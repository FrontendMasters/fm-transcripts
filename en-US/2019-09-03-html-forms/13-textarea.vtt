00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.109
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
let's keep on going with our form.

2
00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:06.568
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
we have some special requests.

3
00:00:06.568 --> 00:00:10.121
Okay, so what do you think would go
here normally, for a form like this,

4
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:12.414
where they're asking for special requests?

5
00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:13.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Input text.

6
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.237
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: An input text,
so just a little box like this,

7
00:00:16.237 --> 00:00:18.070
that's all the requests we get?

8
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.927
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: X box.

9
00:00:18.927 --> 00:00:22.538
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about a big box,
right, we wanna type in a big old box?

10
00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:28.215
All right, and so the way that we
do that is with the text area.

11
00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.470
So we're going to go ahead and add that.

12
00:00:33.716 --> 00:00:37.909
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
guess how we add a text area?

13
00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:40.648
How about textarea?

14
00:00:40.648 --> 00:00:47.851
Okay, that's textarea and
textarea gets an id.

15
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:52.985
And you could call this requests or
often it's called the comments, right?

16
00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:55.918
This is also where your name
is gonna go of comments.

17
00:01:00.653 --> 00:01:07.282
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: /textarea,
what is our value for textarea?

18
00:01:11.732 --> 00:01:13.401
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The input that they-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Whatever

19
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:18.055
they type in the box, whatever they type
in the box is going to be the value.

20
00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:20.362
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Which is why we
don't need to say value in there.

21
00:01:20.362 --> 00:01:21.780
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which is why
we don't need to say value,

22
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.626
because we have no idea
what they're going to type.

23
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:30.706
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, all right, so
we've got our text area set up here.

24
00:01:30.706 --> 00:01:33.267
Clearly we need a label, right?

25
00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:37.447
So this is going to be label for what?

26
00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:40.221
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Comments.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Comments to match our ID.

27
00:01:45.941 --> 00:01:50.711
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, cool, if we go ahead
and save that, though we can go ahead and

28
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:52.320
refresh our webpage.

29
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.181
And hopefully, we have a nice little box.

30
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:59.938
Typing stuff in the box.

31
00:01:59.938 --> 00:02:02.285
It works, right?

32
00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:05.520
It's also got this cool little corner,
so we can pull and make it bigger.

33
00:02:07.112 --> 00:02:11.128
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's kinda awesome,
woo-hoo, we can break our web page,

34
00:02:11.128 --> 00:02:12.325
good fun, okay?

35
00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:15.178
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
it does that change the browser, too?

36
00:02:15.178 --> 00:02:18.603
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, there could be
some formatting that's associated with

37
00:02:18.603 --> 00:02:19.385
the browser.

38
00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:21.917
When we clean it up and make it pretty,
we'll make it look a little different.
