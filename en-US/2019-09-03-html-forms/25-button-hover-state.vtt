00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
Emma says let's add a hover state,

2
00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.660
which I think is a great idea because
then it will look more buttony than ever.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.524
So button color,
how do we add that button one?

4
00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:13.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: :hover.

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.880
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: button:hover, right?

6
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.880
We don't need any As, it's just a button.

7
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.110
And when we hover over the button,
we want something to happen.

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.470
So just button:hover.

9
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.630
And I have a background color I already
picked, but you could pick your own.

10
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.447
So I'll just make my
background color white.

11
00:00:30.447 --> 00:00:33.468
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: You spelled
button incorrectly.

12
00:00:33.468 --> 00:00:37.530
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [LAUGH] You gotta
spell button correctly, sorry.

13
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.315
And my color will be this bb342F.

14
00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:50.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, now you'll be
able to see this on the screen.

15
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:57.010
Okay, so the hover state worked,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pretty good.

16
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.470
Lots of things you could do here
to make a fun kind of button and

17
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.043
you could spend a lot of time on this,
all right.

18
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.718
How's everybody doing so far, okay?

19
00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:10.230
Do we have any questions online?

20
00:01:12.494 --> 00:01:13.135
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah?

21
00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:16.110
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There is
one about the text area.

22
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.780
They're wondering how to
implement max character, thanks.

23
00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.184
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
I actually I addressed that on the break.

24
00:01:22.184 --> 00:01:26.006
There is a property for it, if you go
to the Mozilla Developer Network for

25
00:01:26.006 --> 00:01:28.338
text area, it's listed there on the page.

26
00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:31.971
And I think it's something like max length
is the attribute, if I remember right.
