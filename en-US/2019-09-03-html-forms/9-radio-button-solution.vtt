&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So I've gone ahead and
coded my solution here.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.130
So it's basically the same thing over and
over again.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.450
You just need the label button
wrapping around everything.

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.720
The input type of radio,
the name of UFO type, and

5
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.710
then your values may be different.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.370
You may have called it Battlestar,
you may have called it Viper.

7
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.020
Or you may have called it Galactica
like I did, it doesn't matter.

8
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.630
Whatever you have for the value,
that will be just fine.

9
00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.320
And then finally, for the Borg-style cube,
exactly the same thing,

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.090
the input type of radio, the name
of UFO type, and the value of Borg.

11
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.475
One of the common problems with radio
buttons, and you're definitely going to

12
00:00:37.475 --> 00:00:45.120
wanna do, is once you have put all of
your radio buttons up onto a webpage,

13
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.170
you need to go through and
click them all, okay.

14
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.860
Click on the labels, click on the buttons,

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.120
make sure only one thing
selects at a time, okay?

16
00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.350
If you have multiple radio buttons
selecting, all of them are selected, or

17
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.950
you have two of them selected in a weird
way, but the other ones are not selecting,

18
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.560
something happened with the value
that you have for name.

19
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.800
Because the value for
name needs to always be the same, okay?

20
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.130
So name always has to be ufotype.

21
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.170
You have to spell it the same way.

22
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.710
Silly computers, they don't do typos.

23
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.430
Okay, it's really easy to make a typo.

24
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.520
So these are typical things that
will break if you're coding a set

25
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.820
of radio buttons.

26
00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.150
So anytime you see more than one selected,
it's your name.

27
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.130
The name has gotta be the same for
all of the radio buttons.
