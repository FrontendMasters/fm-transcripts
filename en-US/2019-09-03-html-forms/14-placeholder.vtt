00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What if we wanna have
some sort of information in these

2
00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.910
text areas by default, okay?

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.923
We can do that too.

4
00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:11.637
Let's scroll back on up
to the top of our form,

5
00:00:11.637 --> 00:00:17.453
up here in the,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's say for

6
00:00:17.453 --> 00:00:20.240
your phone number, okay?

7
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.109
For your phone number.

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.631
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In the input for
the phone number, I'm back on line 19,

9
00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:32.470
we may want to go ahead and
put something here, like placeholder.

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.300
That is the attribute, and then inside of
placeholder you can put whatever you want

11
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.890
to show in that field, so
like don't forget your area code.

12
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.033
So placeholder is a way that you
can make some text appear in those,

13
00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.938
like phone, the text, the email.

14
00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:57.664
If you want something to show
up in those fields by default,

15
00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:00.280
that's the way you can go about doing it.

16
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.210
And when you refresh the page,
you'll see it's there in very pale text.

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.750
And when you click in there and
start typing, then that text will go away.

18
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.470
It's just sort of there as a reminder.

19
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.210
You've seen this before in forums, right?

20
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.420
Okay, that's how you do that.
