00:00:00.537 --> 00:00:04.148
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is there any problem
with using negative margin value?

2
00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:06.292
It seems hacky, but it seems to work okay.

3
00:00:06.292 --> 00:00:10.067
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, yeah, that's pretty
much the attitude of the community.

4
00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:14.883
Negative margins are hacky, but it does
in fact work, and it's legal, so yeah.

5
00:00:14.883 --> 00:00:18.815
You could definitely use negative margins.

6
00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:22.037
I've stuck with positive margins,
which, for whatever reason,

7
00:00:22.037 --> 00:00:23.343
people seem happier with.

8
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:27.944
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Other comments?

9
00:00:30.754 --> 00:00:32.387
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Evans like, well, okay well,

10
00:00:32.387 --> 00:00:35.660
I don't really get the more
control thing still.

11
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.460
If we're setting the exact
percentage of the width and

12
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.840
know the exact number
of columns in each row,

13
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.800
setting justified content space evenly
has the same control as setting margins.

14
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You are welcome to do that.

15
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.380
Go right on ahead, okay?

16
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.470
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Is space evenly
usable in browsers today?

17
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm not sure space evenly
has as much support as space between or

18
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.490
space around.

19
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.540
&gt;&gt; Speaker 1: Yeah,
it's not fully compatible yet.

20
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah,
probably not fully compatible.

21
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950
In our universe, where we work with
the latest version of Firefox and

22
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.608
Chrome, it's a beautiful world.

23
00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:15.000
[LAUGH] Everything works, but probably
not in your regular browser stack.
