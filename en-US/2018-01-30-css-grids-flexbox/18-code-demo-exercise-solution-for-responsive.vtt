1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.768
&gt;&gt; Jen: All right.

2
00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:03.289
Now, of course,
when we start to shrink the page down,

3
00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:06.198
nothing changes because we
haven't written those styles yet.

4
00:00:06.198 --> 00:00:07.567
So let's go on ahead and
write those styles.

5
00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:14.216
What's gonna happen then,
&gt;&gt; Jen: First

6
00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:20.151
of all,
&gt;&gt; Jen: So let's talk about a plan here.

7
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:23.826
So in our first row,
we have four going across.

8
00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:25.732
How do we want this to look on a tablet?

9
00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:29.990
&gt;&gt; Jen: Currently at four.

10
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.926
We want to go to two and two, okay.

11
00:00:31.926 --> 00:00:35.762
In the second row,
we have twos next to each other.

12
00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:37.644
Where would you like to
have happened there?

13
00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:42.315
&gt;&gt; Jen: You wanna stack them,
you wanna leave them next to each other?

14
00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.270
Any strong preferences?

15
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.403
I think I left them next to
each other in my example but

16
00:00:47.403 --> 00:00:49.482
you could stack yours if you want.

17
00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.894
How about the third row here?

18
00:00:54.936 --> 00:00:56.347
&gt;&gt; Jen: So we have a one and
we have a three.

19
00:00:56.347 --> 00:00:58.102
You wanna stack these?

20
00:01:02.153 --> 00:01:03.358
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, so we'll stack those.

21
00:01:03.358 --> 00:01:07.141
And then the fourth is pretty easy,
it just continues on the way it is, right?

22
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:12.480
Okay, so
then we have now a behavior difference

23
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.683
between this one,
the first one in row three,

24
00:01:17.683 --> 00:01:22.368
and the ones that make up row one, right?

25
00:01:22.368 --> 00:01:27.334
So the individual boxes in
row one are gonna grow in

26
00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:32.193
size to be two columns wide
when we go to a tablet.

27
00:01:32.193 --> 00:01:38.314
But the item here in row three, the first
item, is gonna grow to occupy four.

28
00:01:38.314 --> 00:01:42.422
So this is where my names come from.

29
00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:49.333
I am going to call these one col-1-2 and
col-1-4.

30
00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:55.650
So, I'm gonna go ahead and
add those here in my CSS,

31
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.823
col-1-2, and col-1-4.

32
00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:04.670
So it does top sizes,
they're gonna behave that way.

33
00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:10.118
&gt;&gt; Jen: Let me also change
my fabulous color up here.

34
00:02:10.118 --> 00:02:13.002
Col-1-4 and

35
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:18.770
let me make sure I change my HTML.

36
00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:30.079
&gt;&gt; Jen: So in my HTML,
&gt;&gt; Jen: There we go.

37
00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:40.367
&gt;&gt; Jen: So in row one,
&gt;&gt; Jen: And then in row three.

38
00:02:49.393 --> 00:02:49.937
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, and

39
00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:53.450
hopefully when you refresh the page
everything is exactly the same.

40
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.439
They will all have the same color as
they all still have the same behavior.

41
00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:01.592
And then we're ready to go ahead and
write these styles for

42
00:03:01.592 --> 00:03:06.627
our tablet display,
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay,

43
00:03:06.627 --> 00:03:10.691
so here on my tablet,
what are we gonna do?

44
00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.647
&gt;&gt; Jen: Anybody have any suggestions?

45
00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:16.697
How should we start?

46
00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:23.885
&gt;&gt; Jen: You all are in
the after lunch slump.

47
00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.468
&gt;&gt; Jen: Food comes all round.

48
00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:30.191
Okay, so col-1-2 and

49
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:35.527
col-2 are gonna have the same behavior,
right?

50
00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:37.901
And their behavior's gonna be this,

51
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.384
&gt;&gt; Jen: 44%.

52
00:03:46.384 --> 00:03:51.353
Everything else is gonna be this

53
00:03:51.353 --> 00:03:57.058
col-1-4, col-3, col-4,

54
00:03:57.058 --> 00:04:01.658
and one we haven't come to yet

55
00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:05.716
will be flex 0 0 92%.

56
00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:11.410
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, 92% being for what?

57
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.160
Yes?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't wanna get too off

58
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.050
track on this because you had already
asked us about naming conventions.

59
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.240
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But generally,

60
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.822
people would stick with
the boot strap column names-

61
00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:21.758
&gt;&gt; Jen: And that's fine.

62
00:04:21.758 --> 00:04:22.456
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Compared to this way?

63
00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:23.805
&gt;&gt; Jen: That would be totally fine.

64
00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:24.807
Yes, absolutely.

65
00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:27.566
I am combining the number
of aspects here so

66
00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:31.630
I'm not calling them specifically
the extra small, small and

67
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.781
large group systems because it's just
like a lot of extra writing and so forth.

68
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:38.601
I'm combining a whole bunch of
things into a single classes.

69
00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:39.397
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

70
00:04:39.397 --> 00:04:41.465
I just meant column wise.

71
00:04:41.465 --> 00:04:45.638
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it's just a little
confusing with the column-1 column-2 but

72
00:04:45.638 --> 00:04:49.540
if there's method to the madness,
it works for me.

73
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.440
&gt;&gt; Jen: And that is a fair criticism.

74
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.858
Obviously, you can call these class
names whatever you wanna call them and

75
00:04:54.858 --> 00:04:56.060
that is absolutely fine.

76
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.083
I'm trying to imply different
than bootstrap though, so.

77
00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:01.052
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Perfect.

78
00:05:01.052 --> 00:05:02.540
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah, okay.

79
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.861
So, let us refresh the page here.

80
00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:12.187
&gt;&gt; Jen: And then hopefully, there we go,
we wind up with a break point.

81
00:05:12.187 --> 00:05:18.638
And you'll notice that our column
ones here work perfectly well.

82
00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:22.111
The floats, if you'd played around
with your page a little bit,

83
00:05:22.111 --> 00:05:24.969
you might have noticed that
they did not work so well.

84
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.450
But here we're working really well.

85
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.970
The equal height aspect is baked
in because this is Flexbox.

86
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.360
So we don't need any JavaScript in
order to make these equal height.

87
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.147
No matter what size these boxes are, no
matter which box is longer the browser is

88
00:05:43.147 --> 00:05:46.304
very smart and
equalizes these very nicely to a row.

89
00:05:48.978 --> 00:05:49.729
&gt;&gt; Jen: There we go.

90
00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:51.530
All right, there we go.

91
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:58.200
All right, so then the last thing is,
let's think about the mobile sizes here.

92
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.052
So right now these are all stacked really
nicely on top of each other which is

93
00:06:04.052 --> 00:06:08.470
great but they actually have no
margin in between them at the moment.

94
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.441
So if you want that
margin that's there then

95
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:15.067
that maybe something to add
outside of a media query.

96
00:06:15.067 --> 00:06:20.394
And in fact, the way I wound up writing
this was, let's see, I think I just

97
00:06:20.394 --> 00:06:25.652
added to this particular style right
here with the attributes selector.

98
00:06:25.652 --> 00:06:29.551
So what I have on line 38,
which is the attributes selector of

99
00:06:29.551 --> 00:06:33.466
anything that starts with col-,
I have a margin left of 4%.

100
00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:39.844
And I'm adding to that
a flex property of 0 0 92%.

101
00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:52.920
&gt;&gt; Jen: And so then I think that,
&gt;&gt; Jen: Should help a little bit.

102
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.780
We wound up getting margins
on either side here.

103
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.600
This is the margin left.

104
00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.040
If you want margin in-between, you can
certainly add more margin here as well.

105
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.925
If you wanna have a little bit of space
between your boxes, so you can add that.
