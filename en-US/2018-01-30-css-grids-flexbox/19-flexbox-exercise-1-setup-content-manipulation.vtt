00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.847
&gt;&gt; Jen: Here's what I'd like for
you to do, in your HTML,

2
00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:04.449
I want you to add a fifth row.

3
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.806
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, so let me hit Return a few
times so you can see what I'm doing.

4
00:00:13.956 --> 00:00:18.980
&gt;&gt; Jen: All right, so here's what I'd
like for you to do, I'm gonna copy

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.206
row number one
&gt;&gt; Jen: Just for its content and

6
00:00:25.206 --> 00:00:31.580
stuff, I'm gonna paste it down here at
the bottom, after the end of row four.

7
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.040
So on line 79, I'll go ahead and paste
in effectively what is row one again.

8
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.784
What I want you to do is,
I want you to do this as a row five,

9
00:00:41.784 --> 00:00:46.013
and what we're gonna do is
we're gonna do a 1-2-1 layout.

10
00:00:46.013 --> 00:00:50.759
So in other words, a left column,
a wider center column, and

11
00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.147
a narrow right column, okay?

12
00:00:53.147 --> 00:00:55.825
So we need three articles to achieve that,
so

13
00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:58.859
you're gonna get rid of
the pumpkin pie at the end.

14
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.718
And obviously these are not
the right classes, so

15
00:01:03.718 --> 00:01:05.751
I'm gonna remove those as well.

16
00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:14.402
&gt;&gt; Jen: So I want you to do the following
in this row number five that we've just

17
00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:15.600
created.

18
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.583
First of all, what I'd like
you to do is to figure out how

19
00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:25.142
you can get it to work on desktop,
one, two, one,

20
00:01:25.142 --> 00:01:28.448
okay, one, two, one, all right?

21
00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:33.506
And then, as an additional step,
I want you give some thought as

22
00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:38.386
to what this would look like on,
let's say tablet or mobile.

23
00:01:38.386 --> 00:01:42.967
And the order that I'd like to have is
that center column of information to be

24
00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:47.421
listed first, followed by the left and
right columns next to each other.

25
00:01:51.504 --> 00:01:55.766
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay,
do I need to draw a diagram, or?

26
00:01:55.766 --> 00:01:56.716
Yes, draw a diagram.

27
00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:06.077
&gt;&gt; Jen: Draw a diagram.

28
00:02:10.852 --> 00:02:13.544
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, desktop dimensions,

29
00:02:13.544 --> 00:02:18.613
that's how I want the row to look,
1, 2, 1, okay?

30
00:02:18.613 --> 00:02:24.606
And then when you go to, say tablet
dimensions, I want it to look this way,

31
00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:29.951
2 at the top, 1 and 1 underneath,
don't rearrange your HTML.

32
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:39.174
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Jen: See

33
00:02:39.174 --> 00:02:41.430
if you can do it without
rearranging your HTML.

34
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.202
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why are you using 44%?

35
00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:44.824
&gt;&gt; Jen: Why am I using 44%?

36
00:02:44.824 --> 00:02:49.275
Because in our first row
where we had the four boxes.

37
00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:50.772
Gonna go back to my PowerPoint here.

38
00:02:53.853 --> 00:03:00.732
&gt;&gt; Jen: [COUGH] Each of these boxes
is 20% red, so 20%, 20%, 20%, 20%.

39
00:03:00.732 --> 00:03:05.479
If I combine two of these, so
I've got column 1 here and

40
00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:09.024
column 1 here, so 20 and 20 is 40.

41
00:03:09.024 --> 00:03:13.723
Don't forget the margin in between these,

42
00:03:13.723 --> 00:03:18.549
which is 4%, so it becomes 44%, okay?

43
00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.809
Other questions?

44
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:30.409
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Regarding the column names,
what does column-1-4 mean exactly?

45
00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.014
&gt;&gt; Jen: So it's gonna go from from
one column wide to four columns wide.

46
00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.168
This is my convention, and
as Peter was pointing out earlier,

47
00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:41.160
maybe it doesn't work for you,
maybe it's not understandable for you.

48
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.040
That's totally okay, you can call
your classes whatever you want.

49
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.590
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it'll be one
item at a certain screen width?

50
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:48.252
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

51
00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:51.590
then four items wide at
the greatest screen width.

52
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.568
&gt;&gt; Jen: Correct,
one column wide to four columns wide, or

53
00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:56.658
one column wide to two columns wide,
that's where my numbers are coming from.

54
00:04:01.036 --> 00:04:06.843
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are you looking for
that much margin below the first row?

55
00:04:06.843 --> 00:04:11.460
&gt;&gt; Jen: 4% under the first row?

56
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.324
That would really be a design decision.

57
00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:17.116
If you wanna have margin in between
your rows, you can certainly add that.

58
00:04:17.116 --> 00:04:20.367
I think most float-based grid
systems don't have that, but

59
00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:22.630
you can certainly add that easily enough.

60
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.400
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can you make
your style sheet visible,

61
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.310
trying to recall follow
the naming convention?

62
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.250
&gt;&gt; Jen: Sure, put up the style sheet.

63
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I mean,
is that in the repo that we can just-

64
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.633
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yep, it's in the answers.

65
00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:40.090
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I can just link to it.

66
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.870
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yep,
you can take a look at the end state, and

67
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.750
that's got all of the CSS in it.

68
00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.910
So in the chapter three folder,
if you look inside of the end folder,

69
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.710
you can take a look at what's there
in terms of the HTML and the CSS.

70
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.899
In this particular exercise,

71
00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:58.565
what we're going to do is,
&gt;&gt; Jen: You've

72
00:04:58.565 --> 00:05:00.269
added a fifth row to your HTML.

73
00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:02.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I think they're
talking about the files

74
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:03.828
&gt;&gt; Jen: There are no files,

75
00:05:03.828 --> 00:05:06.937
just keep working with
the files that you have.

76
00:05:06.937 --> 00:05:10.560
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, so
you can still create new classes, right?

77
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.620
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yes, absolutely,
absolutely, create new classes.

78
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.516
If you can't do it without rearranging
the HTML, feel free to rearrange the HTML.
