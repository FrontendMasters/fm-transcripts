00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There are and

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.100
this is part of the reason that syntax
with flexbox has been challenging.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.890
There are three versions of flexbox.

4
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.794
Originally flexbox came out in 2009,
can you believe it?

5
00:00:12.794 --> 00:00:16.620
And we used to set it up
this way display colon box.

6
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.500
And then, somebody came through with a W3C
and said, no, we should totally rewrite

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.830
the syntax and so,
we then had this display of flexbox.

8
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.950
This is the so called, tweener syntax,

9
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.080
because it goes in between the original
syntax and what's actually in use now.

10
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.390
And there is one browser out
there that you probably support

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.050
that works with the tweener syntax.

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.214
Does anyone know what it is?

13
00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:50.750
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One browser,
only one and it will surprise you.

14
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Safari.
[LAUGH]

15
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.220
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not Safari.

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.120
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: IE.

17
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: IE which,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 9, 10.

18
00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.955
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: IE10.

19
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:03.237
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: IE10, okay.

20
00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:07.530
IE10 is the only one that's
supports the tweener syntax,

21
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.130
and then finally,
now going forward the correct syntax,

22
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.920
the standard compliance
syntax is display flex.

23
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.580
So a word on this.

24
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.880
What I am gonna be teaching you
is the standards compliant code.

25
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.510
We live in a perfect
world in this classroom.

26
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.560
We only support Firefox and Chrome,
only in their most recent version, I know.

27
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.740
It's a wonderful dream isn't it?

28
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.560
We don't have to support all the old IE.

29
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.320
We don't have to support Edge or
Safari or all those other ones.

30
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.640
So I'm gonna teach you
the standards compliant code.

31
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.450
And I know that for many of you,
you're working with Sass.

32
00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.510
You have some sort of methodology that's
gonna put in all of those backwards

33
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.610
compatibility hacks and prefixing and all
the rest of the stuff that goes with it.

34
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.030
We're gonna keep our code simple, we're
just gonna write it standards compliant.

35
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.050
All right, so as i say here,

36
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.233
prefixing may still be required depending
on what your browser set is to support.

37
00:02:08.233 --> 00:02:11.568
Generally speaking, when I teach,
I don't teach a whole lot of cross browser

38
00:02:11.568 --> 00:02:14.766
capability stuff because everybody's
supporting different browsers.

39
00:02:14.766 --> 00:02:18.740
And we can really get bogged down in
these details that change rapidly.

40
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.280
Here's an example of what this
might look like with prefixing,

41
00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.790
that's all the prefixing
you are going to see today.

42
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.970
Let's say I'm putting the UL is
going to be my flex container,

43
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970
my LIs would be flex items.

44
00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.170
That's actually what's going to happen
in the demo that I'm about to show you.

45
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.580
So here we go this is what
this might look like.

46
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.880
Here's our prefixing, we have web kit flex
for old versions of Chrome and Safari.

47
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.030
We have MS flex box for IE10,
that's the tweener syntax,

48
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.620
and then finally display flex is
the standards compliant quote.

49
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.310
So that's it, that's all I'm gonna say
about prefixing And from this point,

50
00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.280
we'll just say display flex.

51
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.210
All right, the current supports and
where it stands, if you are under IE 9,

52
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.500
IE 9 and less, not supported at all,
IE 10 is the tweener syntax.

53
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.620
IE 11 and Edge, so called full support,

54
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.830
it can be a little bit buggy in IE 11,
you'll have to look that up.

55
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.270
Generally speaking,
older versions of Safari,

56
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.700
we're gonna require that webkit prefix and

57
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.620
there's lots of others that support
the current syntax, like including Opera.

58
00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.640
So feel free to use caniuse.com,
always your friend for

59
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.850
looking up what the current
state of support is.
