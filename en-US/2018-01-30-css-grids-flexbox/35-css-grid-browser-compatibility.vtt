1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.732
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this is from the W3C.

2
00:00:01.732 --> 00:00:05.469
And you'll see here in figure one,
this is the way Flexbox works,

3
00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:07.980
also the same way that Floats work.

4
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.229
You have a series of rows, you have cells
inside of them, they can have different

5
00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:16.688
numbers of cells, but fundamentally, one
row has nothing to do with the other row.

6
00:00:16.688 --> 00:00:18.433
In the second example,

7
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:24.770
if you're old enough to remember the
golden fabulous table base layout days.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.550
It looks like table base layouts with
column spans and row spans, doesn't it?

9
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.500
Yeah, it's like fashion,
what's old is new again, right?

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.880
So, it's been 20 years since we did
table base layout, it's about time for

11
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.072
to come back around again.

12
00:00:38.072 --> 00:00:40.750
So, that is a way working,

13
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.798
we've got the ability to span columns,
the ability to span rows.

14
00:00:45.798 --> 00:00:48.256
Make sense?

15
00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.030
Okay.

16
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.650
Browser support is always the big issue.

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.584
And every time I talk about Grid,
I have to go back and

18
00:00:54.584 --> 00:00:58.540
look up what the browser support is,
[LAUGH] cuz it changes so rapidly.

19
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.780
So basically, it is this.

20
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.990
Full support in the latest browsers
that you would expect, okay?

21
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.070
So Edge 16 is where it starts to come
in on the Microsoft side of things.

22
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.201
But do you even are starting
to get it on mobile devices,

23
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:18.910
which wasn't true even as recently as
like three months ago or six months ago.

24
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.320
So, it is coming into full support.

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.740
You do have partial support on all
of the Microsoft browsers, okay?

26
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:28.667
Even all the way back to IE 10.

27
00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:33.442
And that is because Grid has been kicking
around in development for a long time,

28
00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:37.860
IE 10 supported an older
version of the specification.

29
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.768
And so you can work with Grid,
using some of that prefixing,

30
00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:45.570
for some of these older browsers.

31
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.401
So be aware that that's out there.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The browsers

32
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:54.800
that have no support, or mostly mobile
browsers that are not listed above.

33
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.390
Things like Opera Mini,
Opera Mobile, Blackberry, Samsung.

34
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.776
Although I think Samsung might
actually have just added it,

35
00:02:01.776 --> 00:02:03.670
I don't quite remember.

36
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.634
But I am gonna make
the following argument,

37
00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:10.810
it doesn't matter what mobile
browsers do for grid support.

38
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.170
I'm gonna make that argument.

39
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.008
The reason why is,
typically speaking on a mobile device,

40
00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:21.229
at least at this point in our
design development on the Internet,

41
00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:25.550
we tend to stack our boxes on top
of each other vertically, right?

42
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.508
You don't need any layout in order to do
that, you don't need CSS Grid in order to

43
00:02:30.508 --> 00:02:32.850
stack your boxes on top
of each other vertically.

44
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.100
So the fact that your mobile browsers may
not necessarily have the best support for

45
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.440
Grid doesn't necessarily impact you if
that is in fact the layout that you want.

46
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.361
If you wind up wanting to put things
next to each other on your little mobile

47
00:02:45.361 --> 00:02:48.470
screens, then that might
impact some of your decisions.

48
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.950
But do consider that.

49
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.270
What kind of design are you
doing on a mobile device?

50
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.390
And do you actually need
grid support at all.

51
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.076
Okay, and of course as always,
go to caniuse.com to go and

52
00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:04.099
check with the latest is,
and Grid is changing so

53
00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.520
rapidly that you can go there every
month and learn something new.

54
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.700
So I recommend it.

55
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.768
Look at it often.

56
00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:15.410
Okay, so your next question is,
all right, so

57
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.440
we're doing pretty in
terms of Grid support.

58
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.718
What about polyfills?
What about fallbacks?

59
00:03:20.718 --> 00:03:24.920
I am gonna address this towards this
afternoon in a little bit more detail.

60
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.491
But generally speaking if you
are a polyfill kind of person,

61
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.900
and not all of you are,
and I respect that.

62
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.981
If you are a polyfill kind of person,
and you want to back fill to

63
00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:38.890
the old grid specification and pick up
some of those older Microsoft browsers.

64
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.260
There is a polyfilling existence for
that, there it is.

65
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.934
If you wanna polyfill for
the new specifications,

66
00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:50.898
the one that's out there now,
there's a polyfill for that, okay?

67
00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:55.030
There's also this new construct that's
out there CSS called @supports.

68
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.060
Has anyone heard of @supports before?

69
00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.720
Anybody here in the classroom?

70
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.130
A few of you have kind of heard of it?

71
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.016
Okay.

72
00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:08.685
So you can go and read up on @supports,
but basically it's like this.

73
00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:11.200
@supports does a quick test, all right?

74
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.020
The syntax basically.

75
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.140
if the browser supports Grid, right?

76
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.430
Then inside of that @supports construct
that you're gonna put in your CSS,

77
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.202
you can put in all the styles
that pertain to like,

78
00:04:24.202 --> 00:04:27.106
this is what you're gonna do if it's Grid,
right?

79
00:04:27.106 --> 00:04:30.950
Here's the one big problem with @supports.

80
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.605
The browser must support @supports, okay?

81
00:04:36.605 --> 00:04:41.380
The browser must support @supports
in order for that code to execute.

82
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.079
So generally speaking if you use
@supports you are gonna put your latest,

83
00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:48.616
hottest CSS inside of it because older
browsers will just skip over it.

84
00:04:48.616 --> 00:04:57.630
Make sense?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

85
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.700
I see a lot of blank
looks in the classroom.

86
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.401
What I'm going to suggest to you guys,
because I hadn't really counted on

87
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:09.770
focusing on @supports,
you can go and read up on it.

88
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.103
This is the link to
the Mozilla Developer network,

89
00:05:12.103 --> 00:05:14.450
and it'll tell you a little
bit about @supports.

90
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:19.700
Really, you guys are solid CSS people,
you can pick this up in like 5 minutes.

91
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.580
Just read the article, okay?

92
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.320
All right, and then we're gonna look
more at this resource later on today.

93
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.321
Rachel Andrew has been the leaders
on the field of documenting and

94
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:32.710
explaining CSS Grid.

95
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.732
She has an absolutely fabulous cheat sheet
that basically tells you everything you

96
00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:40.130
need to know in terms of your
fallbacks and your overrides.

97
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.970
And we will look at that in more
detail this afternoon, okay?

98
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.650
So using some combination of these things
you can probably get this to work.

99
00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:50.915
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, however, for

100
00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:55.223
the purposes of the class today we are
still going to live in our perfect world

101
00:05:55.223 --> 00:05:58.923
in which we only work with latest
versions of Firefox and Chrome,

102
00:05:58.923 --> 00:06:00.287
it is a glorious world.

103
00:06:00.287 --> 00:06:02.695
And Grid is perfectly
supported everywhere, so

104
00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:06.514
we're really not gonna spend a whole lot
of time worrying about cross browser

105
00:06:06.514 --> 00:06:08.880
compatibility as we
learn the specification.
