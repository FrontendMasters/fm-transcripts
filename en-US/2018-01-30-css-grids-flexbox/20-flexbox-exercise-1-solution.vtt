00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:01.762
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we have a few
people here in class, get it?

2
00:00:01.762 --> 00:00:04.624
I'm hoping that some of you online got it.

3
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:07.085
So Peter says,
he's got an answer here for us.

4
00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:08.552
So what'd you do, Peter?

5
00:00:08.552 --> 00:00:10.076
What did you do first in your HTML?

6
00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.723
What did you call these classes?

7
00:00:12.723 --> 00:00:15.861
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Well, I used a sort
of Bootstrap method of doing it.

8
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:18.039
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

9
00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.511
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
the first one I called col-3.

10
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:23.295
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Col-3, okay?

11
00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:29.177
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then the middle one,
I'm sorry, I called it Col-3-6.

12
00:00:29.177 --> 00:00:30.077
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 3-6?

13
00:00:30.077 --> 00:00:31.538
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
there was a 6 going along with it.

14
00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:32.233
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

15
00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:35.316
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And
the next one was col-6-3.

16
00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:37.099
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 6-3, okay.

17
00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:39.229
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then,
yeah, the same for that one.

18
00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:42.631
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Col-6-3, okay.

19
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:44.511
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Or the, sorry, 3-6.

20
00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.213
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 3-6, okay, so
in other words to translate for

21
00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:54.031
everybody else the two boxes on the left
and the right have the same class name,

22
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.667
the one in the middle has
a different class name.

23
00:00:57.667 --> 00:01:03.542
Okay, [COUGH] And, then in our CSS,
what did you put where?

24
00:01:03.542 --> 00:01:09.335
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So, do you wanna start
with desktop or with the laptop?

25
00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.085
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure,
let's start with the desktop.

26
00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:15.685
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, so at the desktop,
I put the col-6-3 with,

27
00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:18.788
I guess for you it would be the col-2.

28
00:01:18.788 --> 00:01:19.964
So the-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

29
00:01:19.964 --> 00:01:23.046
I'll just write it out this
way make it straight forward.

30
00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:24.455
So it's a flex 0.

31
00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:26.483
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: 0 0 44.

32
00:01:26.483 --> 00:01:27.823
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so obviously,
we could combine those styles, but okay.

33
00:01:27.823 --> 00:01:28.536
And then?

34
00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:36.703
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then I added my
cal-3-6 to what would be your cal-1's.

35
00:01:36.703 --> 00:01:37.351
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

36
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:40.183
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So that's the flex 0 0 20%.

37
00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:41.077
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A 20%, okay, so
something like that, all right.

38
00:01:41.077 --> 00:01:47.207
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then I put col-3-6

39
00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:51.665
in the 44% one,

40
00:01:51.665 --> 00:01:55.308
so the top-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

41
00:01:55.308 --> 00:02:01.124
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Be created-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So col-3-6 would be 44%.

42
00:02:01.124 --> 00:02:02.542
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep.

43
00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:03.438
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

44
00:02:03.438 --> 00:02:09.781
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And the -6-3-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yep?

45
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:12.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Would go with the others,
the-

46
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.246
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Would be the 92%?

47
00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:13.828
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yep.

48
00:02:13.828 --> 00:02:14.598
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

49
00:02:14.598 --> 00:02:15.265
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And then I also gave
the col-6-3 a order of negative 1

50
00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:15.859
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Tricky.

51
00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:24.124
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: To put it at
the front no matter what.

52
00:02:24.124 --> 00:02:26.836
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
its gonna be at the front no matter what.

53
00:02:26.836 --> 00:02:27.555
So this is the fact box in the middle.

54
00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:34.563
The content box with
the way I'm thinking of it.

55
00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:35.231
He's putting a negative order one.

56
00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:39.733
So that would be show up
at the front of the list.

57
00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:45.425
Col-3, col-3-6,
which is the left or right ends.

58
00:02:45.425 --> 00:02:50.523
That has no order to it, so
it will follow after, okay, great.

59
00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:51.210
And then what?

60
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.616
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I did one last thing.

61
00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:54.464
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

62
00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:57.800
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It wasn't working
well on my computer, so

63
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.313
I gave this media query a limit.

64
00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.043
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

65
00:03:01.043 --> 00:03:01.841
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
it has a minimum width right now.

66
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:05.780
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But I also wrote in and

67
00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.676
max width of 7627.

68
00:03:09.676 --> 00:03:10.649
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 7627.

69
00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.523
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Pixels.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pixels.

70
00:03:12.523 --> 00:03:13.507
I got it.

71
00:03:13.507 --> 00:03:21.402
Okay, so here we've limited
this particular media query.

72
00:03:21.402 --> 00:03:22.737
So in other words,

73
00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:27.335
the styles that are here deactivate
when we get to desktop sizes.

74
00:03:27.335 --> 00:03:31.070
So let's test and see how that works.

75
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.832
If we refresh the page,
here's the row on the bottom.

76
00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:38.088
And I don't have it in color,

77
00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:43.157
because I haven't specified those styles,
but we could do that.

78
00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:48.103
And then when I shrink it down,
here we go.

79
00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.626
I get to my right break point,
so you see now,

80
00:03:50.626 --> 00:03:54.013
Boston Cream Pie, which was in
the middle is now on the top and

81
00:03:54.013 --> 00:03:57.282
Coconut Cream Pie and
Key Lime Pie are underneath, okay?

82
00:03:57.282 --> 00:03:59.886
And presumably,
as I shrink it down even further,

83
00:03:59.886 --> 00:04:02.900
then these guys are just gonna stack and
be happy.

84
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.858
And there they are stacked in, of course,
the order that the HTML was placed in.

85
00:04:06.858 --> 00:04:14.200
Now, so the way Peter had to make this
work, was he added this max width of 7627.

86
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.928
Can anyone think of a way that we
could make this work without changing

87
00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:20.159
the media query?

88
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.640
Anyone have a suggestion on that?

89
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.550
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In the desktop styles
you could reset the order number.

90
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.620
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could reset the order
number in the desktops styles.

91
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.570
So instead of limiting our media query
here, which is completely legitimate.

92
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.756
You can totally go ahead and
use a range like this.

93
00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:45.428
But it might be awkward to do that,
if you already have a page

94
00:04:45.428 --> 00:04:49.924
existing that relies on just
the min-width being true.

95
00:04:49.924 --> 00:04:54.506
You could do something different,
which would be to come down here to these

96
00:04:54.506 --> 00:04:59.247
classes, the 6-3 and the 3-6, and
what would you recommend for that?

97
00:04:59.247 --> 00:05:00.422
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I set it to 0.

98
00:05:00.422 --> 00:05:04.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just to 0, and
both of these to 0 or one of them to 0?

99
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.681
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I only had
to play with the one.

100
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:07.850
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You only
had to play with the one.

101
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.080
So here we set column-6-3,
the fat one in the middle,

102
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.085
we set that to a negative 1 here.

103
00:05:16.085 --> 00:05:22.218
So down here at the bottom, we can set
our order on that same class to 0.

104
00:05:22.218 --> 00:05:27.844
And then that should preserve the desktop

105
00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:32.351
order here as we scrunch this up.

106
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.186
So there we go with the pies
stacked on top of each other, and

107
00:05:36.186 --> 00:05:38.816
then when scrunch it down even further.

108
00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.818
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There they go.

109
00:05:42.818 --> 00:05:45.387
One, two, three, stacked all on top.

110
00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:50.334
Now, that is the kind of reordering that
would simply not be possible with floats,

111
00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:53.666
okay, or possible with a great
deal of math, perhaps.

112
00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:56.516
But to be able to pull out
these items within a row and

113
00:05:56.516 --> 00:05:59.310
then make them appear in
whatever order you want.

114
00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.408
This is really, really powerful and
it's so simple.

115
00:06:02.408 --> 00:06:06.214
So that's a really great trick to have
