00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.790
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
my solution looked like this.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.590
So this is the, I took the history page,
I renamed it gallery.html.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.920
I deleted the content that
was there on the page.

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.380
And replaced it.

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.490
So after the nav bar,
I added a div with a class of gallery.

6
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.820
The history page,
it was a div with a class of content.

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.230
So, I've just changed that class name.

8
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.640
And then we’ve got our H2
introducing the content.

9
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.610
Followed by that long list with all
the figures in it that we had before.

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.976
Blah, blah, blah.

11
00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:35.980
And then it goes all way down to
the footer down here on the bottom.

12
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.150
So, that’s the html.

13
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.950
In the CSS, notably what I did
here was around line 62-63.

14
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.030
This had been a style that had been for
the content only before,

15
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.740
I added the gallery class to that, because
I wanted that same background color,

16
00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.790
the same radius,
the same padding associated with that.

17
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.950
And then after that I added my
Flexbox based gallery styles.

18
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:09.040
Same kind of way that I did
before from the FlexGrid/flexbox.

19
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.640
Gallery layout exercise that we did
as part of the wrapup from yesterday.

20
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.990
So gallery UL, gallery LI,
and the gallery image.

21
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.708
So that's all of that
particular content there.

22
00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:24.538
And then in terms of everything
else in the media queries,

23
00:01:24.538 --> 00:01:27.990
I don't think I actually
did too much there.

24
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.820
I changed some of the layout a little
bit with the content, well, that was for

25
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.090
the history page.

26
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.920
We don't have a content class
on this particular page.

27
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.730
So that was pretty much it.

28
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.940
I kept it really super simple for
this image gallery page.

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.342
So are there any questions
on this particular exercise?

30
00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:53.843
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is
really a notable exercise,

31
00:01:53.843 --> 00:01:56.790
because this is sort of
the layout of the future.

32
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.430
We have grid laying out
the structure of the web page,

33
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.160
we have Flexbox controlling all of
these UI elements in the middle of it.

34
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.520
In this case,
it happened to be an image gallery.

35
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.471
I'm sure that you have enough imagination
to think these could have been cards

36
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:16.346
coming out of bootstrap, or they could
have been little blurbs of some kind or

37
00:02:16.346 --> 00:02:17.033
another.

38
00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:20.900
Some other kind of little box, a whole
bunch of them being served up on the page.

39
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.800
And so Flexbox is a great way to handle
those and display those on the page.

40
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.060
Now, you could have done that
with a nested grid as well.

41
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.990
You can absolutely do it with a nested
grid laying out that content as well.

42
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.870
The advantage that Flexbox has here is
that we can have as many of these as we

43
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.780
want, we don't have to worry about any
kind of repeated sorts of layouts.

44
00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.800
And the other thing to remember is that
grid is designed to work in two dimensions

45
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.170
while Flexbox is designed to work in one.

46
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.364
If you have a whole bunch of these images,
they are essentially the same.

47
00:02:55.364 --> 00:02:57.763
They have the same kind of
treatment over and over again.

48
00:02:57.763 --> 00:03:00.275
And they're just wrapping
onto another line.

49
00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:03.285
Then Flexbox is a perfectly
adequate way to make this work.

50
00:03:03.285 --> 00:03:07.837
You don't need to go to a grid system
where we're specifying both columns and

51
00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:10.090
rows to lay something out on the page.
