00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.540
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now we're gonna
go ahead and do a code demo.

2
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:08.190
In day one, we're gonna go to chapter
number two, which is our Flexbox intro.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.660
And first of all, I'll point you to
the file called Flexbox Properties.

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.120
People here in the classroom,
you have a printout of this.

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.390
That's the print out that's
there in front of you.

6
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.280
If you're online you can follow along.

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.553
I would actually recommend
printing this out.

8
00:00:22.553 --> 00:00:24.938
Personally, maybe I'm just old school but

9
00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:28.010
I find it super helpful
to have this printed out.

10
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.170
And I can look things up very
quickly as I write in Flexbox.

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.322
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I also made a PDF and

12
00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:35.040
linked to it on the chatroom.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and

13
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.250
Marcus made a PDF of this, as well.

14
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.090
If you want the pretty Word version
instead of the ugly text version.

15
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.750
Of course, this you can copy and
paste from.

16
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.922
So this is gonna tell you
what the properties are,

17
00:00:44.922 --> 00:00:46.274
some of the potential values.

18
00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:48.400
And I'm gonna show you
these in action right now.

19
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.150
All right, so what we're gonna
do is we're gonna code together.

20
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.660
If you go on ahead and
open up the Flexbox notes document,

21
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.630
this is what I'm going to show.

22
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.962
If you open up boxes.html.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This

23
00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:09.760
is our HTML that we're
gonna be working with.

24
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.500
And in the CSS folder,
of course, open up boxes.css.

25
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.226
So let's take a look at
our starting state HTML.

26
00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:19.040
As you'll see here, it's pretty simple.

27
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.480
We're gonna just work with a basic list.

28
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.438
We have here,
I've put some classes on the &lt;li&gt;.

29
00:01:26.438 --> 00:01:28.077
You'll see why in a little while.

30
00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:30.847
And you'll see that this
is just Lorem ipsum and

31
00:01:30.847 --> 00:01:34.735
I've number those so you can see
what the order of these boxes are.

32
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.507
If I go on ahead and display this
in a browser, you'll see that,

33
00:01:40.507 --> 00:01:44.095
whoops.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You'll see that we

34
00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:47.890
have a whole bunch of boxes,
isn't that exciting?

35
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.120
Look at all those lovely boxes and

36
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.000
then if we take a look at our CSS.

37
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.130
I reset the font family because Times
as a font annoys me on the web.

38
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.380
Then we have our &lt;ul&gt; and our &lt;li&gt; and
this is this like super simple CSS.

39
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.806
One of the things that I have done here
I have put in a little bit of margin and

40
00:02:10.806 --> 00:02:11.710
padding.

41
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.940
Normally you don't necessarily
do this with Flexbox.

42
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.280
But I have done it here because I want
you to see the difference between

43
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.450
the outside dotted line.

44
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.678
And I think I'm going to modify these,
let me just modify these a little bit.

45
00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.442
I'm gonna make my border five pixels so

46
00:02:28.442 --> 00:02:34.150
that you can clearly see the difference
on this projector as to what's going on.

47
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.270
There we go, that's better, so
the outside dotted line is the &lt;ul&gt;.

48
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.830
And then the inside grey lines
are the individual &lt;li&gt;s.

49
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:45.410
This is just so

50
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.604
you can see what's going on as we start to
apply some of these Flexbox properties.
