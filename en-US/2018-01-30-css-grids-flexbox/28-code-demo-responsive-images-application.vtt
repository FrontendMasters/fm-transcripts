WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.026
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's go ahead and
see some of those things in action.

2
00:00:02.026 --> 00:00:09.530
And I'm gonna start with,
let's work on the one big picture problem.

3
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.930
So if you go into chapter six,
and take a look

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:20.430
inside of your Begin folder in chapter
six, this is the HTML you're gonna see.

5
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.140
All right, and if we display this
on a web page, you will see this.

6
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.280
And I'll make it smaller so
we can see the whole thing.

7
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.830
It says, I am the original Peace Pie.

8
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.149
And here is the original
piece pie's dimensions.

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.390
And it's a 1.6 megabyte file, okay?

10
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.880
So I'm gonna walk you through how we might
go ahead and use the picture tag in order

11
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.340
to make this work and
load in different images.

12
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.840
So here in our HTML what we're
gonna do is the following.

13
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.330
So rather than putting this in a div
tag around this image, we're gonna

14
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.790
put this in a picture tag, okay?

15
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.869
So we're going to have a picture and
a /picture.

16
00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.550
And any of you familiar with the video or
audio tags in HTML5?

17
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
Anyone familiar with those tags?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Some sort of a video tag.

18
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A little bit with

19
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.710
a video tag.

20
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.590
It's unfortunate, but true,
of course, that using the video tag,

21
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.900
you can make video display right on
your web page, which is awesome.

22
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.052
The down side is that some browsers
display one video format, and

23
00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:42.531
other browsers display
different video formats.

24
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:45.420
Not so good.

25
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.480
So with the video tag, what you typically
do is you list a series of tags called

26
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.670
source inside of that video tag.

27
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.420
And you can list which appropriate
file formats that you have,

28
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.470
whatever it happens to be.

29
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.680
The picture tag is gonna work
pretty much the same kind of way.

30
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.510
So for the picture tag here,
what we'll start with is a source

31
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.289
tag that goes inside of that picture tag
between the picture and /picture tags.

32
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.710
And then we're going to give it an srcset,
which is a path to an image.

33
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.106
If you look inside of your image folder,

34
00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:25.338
you'll see that I've given you three
formats of the Peace Pie, okay?

35
00:02:25.338 --> 00:02:34.041
And the first one we're going to
list here is img/peace-pie-original.

36
00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:38.760
It's actually just like that, .jpg, and

37
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.784
then it's also gonna have a media
attribute associated with it.

38
00:02:45.784 --> 00:02:48.020
And the media attribute is guess what?

39
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.200
A media query.

40
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.960
So we could say min-width:

41
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.900
1200px, just like that.

42
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.460
So in other words,

43
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.670
this image isn't going to display unless
the screen is at least 1200 pixels wide.

44
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.134
Relatively safe, that's probably some
kind of desktop which means that

45
00:03:15.134 --> 00:03:19.244
they're probably on Wi-Fi,
relatively safe thing to do, okay?

46
00:03:19.244 --> 00:03:23.500
That's the end of the source tag.

47
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.230
Once you've got that in place,
then we can go ahead and

48
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.800
copy that same source tag,
and we'll repeat that again.

49
00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.080
This time we're gonna link
to the 500 pixel wide image.

50
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:44.250
So this name is peace-pie-500.

51
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.760
So that's a 500 pixel wide image, and

52
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.410
I'm gonna say for the minimum
width on that will be 800 pixels.

53
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.330
Now the media queries that I'm
using here are all min widths.

54
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.810
You can do any kind of
media query you want.

55
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.100
It can be a min width and a max width.

56
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.950
It can be all max widths.

57
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.440
Whatever it is that you normally do
with media queries, you can do here.

58
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.310
You can mirror the media queries
that you have in your CSS already.

59
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.250
Whatever you're using for
your breakpoints there,

60
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.110
you can mirror those same
breakpoints here, make sense, okay?

61
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:24.360
And then the final one of these, and
you can have as many of these as you want.

62
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.530
Obviously I'm just doing three
because it's the magic number.

63
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.490
So the final one that you have here is
gonna be the img/peace-pie-150.jpg, and

64
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:41.750
it's in an image tag as opposed
to being in the source tag.

65
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.700
So this is kind of your fallback.

66
00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.810
It's also your mobile version that
you're going to display, okay?

67
00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.050
So if the browser doesn't understand
anything but an image tag,

68
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.790
it will at least display
something here on the page.

69
00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.180
And then this is where you would
place your alt tag as well.

70
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.060
My amazing peace pie at
the appropriate dimension.

71
00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.960
So that alt tag that you put here is
going to apply to the other images that

72
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.560
are associated with the source tags, okay?

73
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.280
So you only need to put
in the one alt tag here.

74
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.890
And if you go on ahead and
save that and refresh your web page,

75
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.160
you should see a great, big, huge,
giant Peace Pie at giant dimensions.

76
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.291
And then as you start to zoom down,
hopefully it will switch to something

77
00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:42.307
else.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

78
00:05:42.307 --> 00:05:47.470
maybe it's not.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Mine did finally there.

79
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.270
Didn't seem to work here.

80
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.530
What did I do?

81
00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:52.884
Thin width 800 pixels.

82
00:05:52.884 --> 00:05:59.296
img/peace-pie-500.jpeg.

83
00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:04.261
If somebody sees what I've done
wrong here in my code, let me know.

84
00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:09.653
img/peace-pie, that is 500, right?

85
00:06:09.653 --> 00:06:11.139
500, I'll do 500 original.

86
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:24.350
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, I'm not gonna
worry about it for the moment.

87
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.210
Because we're gonna add
something else here anyway.

88
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.930
Did it work for any of you?

89
00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.230
Did you get three images?

90
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.170
Okay, so I have some weird
something going on in here.

91
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:38.810
Okay, cool, so
that works great, obviously, in

92
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.580
our perfect world where we only work with
the latest version of Firefox and Chrome.

93
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.450
In the real world there's obviously
other things we got to do.
