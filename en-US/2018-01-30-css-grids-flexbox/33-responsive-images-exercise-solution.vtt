WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.348
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: As always, it's web design.

2
00:00:02.348 --> 00:00:05.127
So there's lots of different
answers that are possible.

3
00:00:05.127 --> 00:00:06.943
These are the answers that I came up with.

4
00:00:06.943 --> 00:00:10.643
You may have something different, and they
may be absolutely, totally right as well.

5
00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:16.082
So what I had asked you to do as part
of the wrap-up portion of the flexbox

6
00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:21.083
portion of the day, was we had done
two things just prior to that.

7
00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:24.888
One, we had laid out an image
gallery using flexbox, and

8
00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:27.992
we had taken a look at
some responsive images.

9
00:00:27.992 --> 00:00:32.457
And so,
what I asked you to do to finish things up

10
00:00:32.457 --> 00:00:37.146
was to create a gallery page,
a history page, and

11
00:00:37.146 --> 00:00:41.859
if you had time,
also a homepage for the website.

12
00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.208
And so we'll go ahead and
take a quick peek at those.

13
00:00:47.208 --> 00:00:52.120
All right, so on the history page,
the thing that I had asked you to do

14
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.779
is to take the image that we had here
of Merilee and swap that out for

15
00:00:56.779 --> 00:01:00.375
different size images at
different dimensions.

16
00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:04.574
And you did that using the picture tag and
using different size

17
00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:09.512
images that you went ahead and
created, and the Picturefill polyfill.

18
00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:12.802
So if we go on ahead and
narrow down our web browser here,

19
00:01:12.802 --> 00:01:17.642
you'll see that the size of this picture
will change at the various breakpoints.

20
00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:20.651
There we go,
smaller picture at that breakpoint.

21
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:27.484
And then finally a much smaller
image here for mobile dimensions.

22
00:01:27.484 --> 00:01:29.431
And if we take a look
at the code to do that,

23
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:32.572
it should look pretty familiar
compared to what we did yesterday.

24
00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:37.061
So here in history.html you can
see that we have those script

25
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:40.330
tags that are running from lines 8 to 12.

26
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.079
That includes the little bit of
JavaScript that tells the browser

27
00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.408
what a picture tag is if it
doesn't happen to already know.

28
00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:54.869
And then a line that calls
the Picturefill script,

29
00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.536
and that is on line 12.

30
00:01:57.536 --> 00:02:02.798
And then as we scroll on down
the page here, if you go to line 33,

31
00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:09.202
this is the bit of code that calls
the picture tag, which is an HTML 5.1 tag.

32
00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:13.260
You'll see that I gave it a class of float
right, so that's how I'm floating that

33
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.900
picture, no matter which version
of the picture that I display,

34
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.160
whether that's one of these source tags or
the final image tag.

35
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.914
They'll all be floated right.

36
00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:26.514
So you'll see that we'll call
the different sized images here,

37
00:02:26.514 --> 00:02:29.777
they're associated with the appropriate
media queries as to what should display

38
00:02:29.777 --> 00:02:30.312
on the page.

39
00:02:30.312 --> 00:02:34.350
And by default the last image is
the mobile friendly version of that image.

40
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.220
Okay, so that's the history page.

41
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.008
On the gallery page,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This is very similar.

42
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.266
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We'll open
that up in the browser.

43
00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:50.159
So here's the gallery page.

44
00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.059
And what I've got going on here was I
took that same design that I had from

45
00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:58.920
the history page, dumped the right column
so that this is more of a full width.

46
00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.840
And then I went ahead and

47
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.370
put my flexbox based grid system
right on inside of the pie gallery.

48
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.300
So you see here, we have lovely
images on all the various lines.

49
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.451
And as you shrink this down,
we go to two images across,

50
00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:18.745
and then finally one image across.

51
00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:24.915
And so the code for that,
if we take a look at gallery.html.

52
00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:28.610
You'll see I just copied in my
list that I already had created.

53
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.224
We went through this as an exercise
yesterday in chapter five.

54
00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:36.074
And I copied that HTML so
I didn't have to retype it all.

55
00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:39.746
And the only little change that
I made is up here in line 28,

56
00:03:39.746 --> 00:03:41.482
I gave it a class of gallery.

57
00:03:41.482 --> 00:03:44.050
So in my example in chapter five,

58
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:50.030
I use just the HTML tags themselves to
lay out this particular image gallery.

59
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.415
But with the addition of this class,
when you take a look at our CSS styling,

60
00:03:55.415 --> 00:04:00.816
and if you're looking at the end file for
that, it starts around line 84.

61
00:04:00.816 --> 00:04:04.703
You'll see that I have just
used that one class and

62
00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:09.238
associated it with the various
tags that are in that list,

63
00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:15.490
via descendant selectors or sort of
a combination selector there on line 85.

64
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.040
And then that way it can keep the code
really super clean, only adding one class.

65
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.850
I didn't have to put a separate class
on each LI or all the figures or

66
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:23.970
anything like that.

67
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.940
So that's how I did that.

68
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.930
And then finally we have a home page.

69
00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.680
And the home page, I didn't give you any
art direction on the home page at all.

70
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.910
I said if you have time and

71
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.830
you happen to look at the branding folder
that has the content inside of it and

72
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.940
pictures and so forth, feel free to go
on ahead and put together a home page.

73
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.706
So I created one of these,
Homemade Pies for Every Celebration.

74
00:04:50.706 --> 00:04:55.460
I used the picture of all the slices of
pie as a little background banner here.

75
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.030
And then using the background image
techniques that I talked about yesterday

76
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.080
afternoon, I went ahead and
made that appear.

77
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.500
And you can see that that image size
does change part way through here

78
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.940
as I shrink the screen down.

79
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.870
And it's since it's a background image,
of course,

80
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.570
what it will do is just simply crop
off the part that doesn't display.

81
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.040
Which is totally fine,
you're not really losing anything.

82
00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.030
And then at mobile dimensions
it doesn't display at all.

83
00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.280
And then down here on the bottom,
of course, I've just got some little boxes

84
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.840
based on that same grid system
that we've worked on previously.

85
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.641
So are there any questions on the type
of thing that I put together here?

86
00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:45.707
Anybody have any questions pertaining
to flexbox, flexbox grid systems?

87
00:05:45.707 --> 00:05:47.957
Anything else lingering from yesterday?

88
00:05:47.957 --> 00:05:55.543
Sure, so we had a question here in
class about min width and with flexbox.

89
00:05:55.543 --> 00:05:59.059
So Amy's question was that
as pages get wider and

90
00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:03.453
we wind up with flexbox doing it's thing,
being flexible.

91
00:06:03.453 --> 00:06:07.163
At some point do we need a min
width somewhere along the way?

92
00:06:07.163 --> 00:06:10.206
And that's really a question of design.

93
00:06:10.206 --> 00:06:11.490
You can do that, or not.

94
00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.177
As you can see in my pages that I've built
here, I put a min width on a wrapper for

95
00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:17.185
the whole page.

96
00:06:17.185 --> 00:06:21.160
So this particular design can
only get to 1200 pixels wide.

97
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.124
If you were to remove that then
this page would scale indefinitely.

98
00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:32.586
And so I made the art decision to keep
the size of my page to a minimum.

99
00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:34.274
You don't have to do that.

100
00:06:34.274 --> 00:06:37.457
In terms of, so I never think
that's a bad idea by the way.

101
00:06:37.457 --> 00:06:41.538
I think that that's an art decision
that you can make based on the kinds

102
00:06:41.538 --> 00:06:46.037
of browsers that you're using, levels
of accessibility that you might need

103
00:06:46.037 --> 00:06:49.796
to maintain, the types of the devices
that you need to support.

104
00:06:49.796 --> 00:06:53.902
There's a whole lot of factors that
would play into whether you would do

105
00:06:53.902 --> 00:06:54.661
that or not.

106
00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:57.575
If you were putting min width
on individual grid cells,

107
00:06:57.575 --> 00:07:01.010
I don't necessarily think that's
the best idea in the world.

108
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.820
I you can probably better handle things
with a min width on an outside container.

109
00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.740
But that's just my opinion.

110
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.150
I think, technically speaking,

111
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.220
there is nothing wrong with putting
that min width wherever you want.

112
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.550
Technically speaking, it should work okay.

113
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:21.040
But I think I tend to be more of
a code minimalist, and I tend to put

114
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.882
things abstracted away as far as possible
as you just saw in that image gallery.

115
00:07:27.882 --> 00:07:31.741
Use one class where possible rather
than repeating the same classes over and

116
00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:32.411
over again.

117
00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:36.796
Take advantage of the cascade and
inheritance in order to keep cleaner and

118
00:07:36.796 --> 00:07:39.920
more maintainable code,
that tends to be my style.
