WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.118 --> 00:00:02.891
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So now that we've got
that in place and we have our shapes,

2
00:00:02.891 --> 00:00:06.514
the next thing that we're probably
interested in doing is cleaning up these

3
00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:07.494
sizes a little bit.

4
00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:11.765
So what I did in the painting, kinda like
in a cooking show where Julia Childs

5
00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:15.923
slides the turkey into the oven and
says in three hours it looks like this.

6
00:00:15.923 --> 00:00:18.490
And she opens the top oven and
pulls out the baked turkey.

7
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.992
We're doing the same thing here.

8
00:00:19.992 --> 00:00:24.884
So what I did here with my painting was
I used a tool that comes with Firefox

9
00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:27.529
called the Web Developer toolbar, and

10
00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.041
it's got one of those rulers on it
that measures things in pixels.

11
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:33.166
You may have a similar tool.

12
00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.198
It may not be from
the Web Developer toolbar.

13
00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:39.391
But we basically need some kind
of tool that can measure pixels.

14
00:00:39.391 --> 00:00:43.665
Okay, so the web developer tool bar
that I have plugged in is right here.

15
00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:47.563
If you type Web Developer tool
bar into Google you'll find it.

16
00:00:47.563 --> 00:00:51.674
It's an extension from Chris Patrick and
it's available for

17
00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:53.422
both Chrome and Firefox.

18
00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:57.146
It was one of the earliest web
development tools that was out there.

19
00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:02.103
And once you've got the web
developer toolbar in place,

20
00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:07.677
if you go to, here's Miscellaneous,
and then Display Ruler,

21
00:01:07.677 --> 00:01:13.063
this particular one,
you can drag this little ruler around.

22
00:01:13.063 --> 00:01:17.616
And sort of,
let's make it match up here with c.

23
00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:21.680
One of the nice things is that
you can blow up your image and

24
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.993
the pixel dimensions
here are still the same.

25
00:01:24.993 --> 00:01:29.817
So we can drag this around and
come up with a size.

26
00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:31.527
And it's reporting that size up here.

27
00:01:31.527 --> 00:01:36.069
So this is 453 by 435 pixels, okay?

28
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.829
So, this is the kind of thing that
you can do with a tool like this and

29
00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:42.929
you can measure the sizes
of this particular squares.

30
00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.024
And so I went ahead and
did all that for you.

31
00:01:46.024 --> 00:01:47.478
You can thank me later.

32
00:01:47.478 --> 00:01:53.571
[LAUGH] And so what we're going to do then
in our CSS we're gonna scroll back and

33
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:55.462
up here to the wrapper.

34
00:01:55.462 --> 00:01:58.817
And we're gonna introduce
two more properties to this.

35
00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:05.711
One is grid-template-rows.

36
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:11.082
And the other is grid-template-columns,
okay?

37
00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:15.450
So these two properties are a way
of calling out a grid system for

38
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.438
your whole entire webpage.

39
00:02:17.438 --> 00:02:20.226
So you could say here to your browser,

40
00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:25.281
I would like to create some number
of rows, some number of columns and

41
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:30.264
I can give all those rows and
columns dimensions on the page, okay?

42
00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:33.592
And I'm just gonna do this in pixels for
now.

43
00:02:33.592 --> 00:02:36.958
There are plenty of other units
you can use that are not pixels.

44
00:02:36.958 --> 00:02:41.563
But given the fact that we are creating
a painting that has a very fixed size, and

45
00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:44.315
we're not worried about content or
anything,

46
00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.508
we're just gonna do this
first example all in pixels.

47
00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:53.290
And then I'll introduce you to some of
those probably much better units for

48
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.532
doing website design and
development later on today.

49
00:02:57.532 --> 00:03:03.208
So basically the numbers
that I came up with here for

50
00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:09.544
my template rows and
template columns are as follows, so

51
00:03:09.544 --> 00:03:16.804
170 pixels, 210 pixels,
61 pixels, and 61 pixels.

52
00:03:16.804 --> 00:03:19.451
Okay, so those will be our four rows.

53
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:24.660
And if you take a look at the painting
you can see where that comes from,

54
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.500
170 for this a, 210 for this b.

55
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.279
And then the heights of f and g are about
the same, about 61 pixels tall, okay.

56
00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.242
So that's where those come from.

57
00:03:34.242 --> 00:03:34.907
Yes?

58
00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:37.643
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
you can enter any sort of number in there?

59
00:03:37.643 --> 00:03:38.337
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

60
00:03:38.337 --> 00:03:41.880
it'll just keep knowing for
how many columns forever?

61
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.128
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, so the fact that I'm
going to now call out four numbers here,

62
00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:50.784
the grid system will create four rows for
me and

63
00:03:50.784 --> 00:03:55.400
those are going to basically
be the heights of those rows.

64
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.942
When we combine it with the columns it
probably makes a little bit more sense but

65
00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:00.991
those are how tall those
rows are going to be.

66
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:03.926
And then for our columns,

67
00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:09.665
we're going to have
the numbers of 124 pixels,

68
00:04:09.665 --> 00:04:14.347
376 pixels, and 42 pixels, okay?

69
00:04:14.347 --> 00:04:16.798
So, those are gonna be our three columns.

70
00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:21.422
So, you can see how those numbers
intersect to form squares on the page.

71
00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:28.355
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] Now what happens
if we happen to have, we go through H,

72
00:04:28.355 --> 00:04:30.120
I think on this page.

73
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.917
What if we had I, J, K, and L?

74
00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:33.310
What would happen at that point?

75
00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:38.962
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Will anyone take a guess?

76
00:04:38.962 --> 00:04:41.636
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Probably
automatically create a new-

77
00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:43.633
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It will keep creating more

78
00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:48.543
rows and more columns according
to this sort of pattern, okay?

79
00:04:48.543 --> 00:04:56.561
Great, so then for the grid gap we
set that up as 10 pixels initially.

80
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:03.100
Change that to 30px 20px.

81
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.633
Okay, so grid-gap can be specified in,
of course,

82
00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:11.379
sort of the column basis or
on the row basis.

83
00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:14.773
And we have two numbers here,
you can think of this just like we

84
00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:19.363
do with margin:0 auto, which you've
probably put in a web page before, right?

85
00:05:19.363 --> 00:05:22.944
Zero is the top and the bottom,
auto is the left and the right.

86
00:05:22.944 --> 00:05:26.899
Same kinda thing here,
30 pixels is the top and the bottom, or

87
00:05:26.899 --> 00:05:28.666
the space between the rows.

88
00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:32.030
20 pixels is the up and down, or
the space between the columns.

89
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.019
Make sense?

90
00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:39.311
Okay, now, because this is a painting,
the exact layout here,

91
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:43.355
because I can't specify
my grid gap precisely for

92
00:05:43.355 --> 00:05:45.953
every single one of these gaps,

93
00:05:45.953 --> 00:05:51.655
we'll be off by few pixels in
the painting but we'll be pretty close.

94
00:05:53.374 --> 00:05:55.040
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Close enough for
our purposes.

95
00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.034
So if you refresh your web page,
you should see

96
00:06:00.034 --> 00:06:04.912
we're getting pretty
close to what that is.

97
00:06:08.122 --> 00:06:10.731
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And you can probably
finesse those numbers a little bit more

98
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:11.782
and get it even closer.

99
00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:15.464
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But, you get the idea.

100
00:06:15.464 --> 00:06:17.165
Anybody have any questions at this point?

101
00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:22.148
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

102
00:06:22.148 --> 00:06:24.491
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Is there any
way to color that grid gap or

103
00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:26.645
is that just background space?

104
00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:28.043
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What a wonderful question.

105
00:06:28.043 --> 00:06:29.359
That's totally a plan.

106
00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:33.360
That's the next thing we're gonna go into
is how we're gonna put the colors in.

107
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.026
And any other questions at this point?

108
00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:38.671
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Without
specifying any additional rows,

109
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:40.733
will that take on an auto height?

110
00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:46.096
Keeping the last value 42 pixels or
restart it 124 pixels.

111
00:06:46.096 --> 00:06:48.174
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure,
let's go on ahead and try it.

112
00:06:48.174 --> 00:06:53.947
So I'm just gonna go ahead and
add some more rows here,

113
00:06:53.947 --> 00:07:00.107
and I'm not gonna have any
classes associated with them.

114
00:07:03.031 --> 00:07:04.517
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Or
some more divs I should say.

115
00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:07.212
All right, so there's some more stuff.

116
00:07:07.212 --> 00:07:08.787
If we were to display that,

117
00:07:17.859 --> 00:07:19.351
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we go.

118
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:22.383
They're showing up down here at
the bottom as lines because I

119
00:07:22.383 --> 00:07:23.636
have no content in them.

120
00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:25.540
So let me just give you
a little bit of content.

121
00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:48.739
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So you can see down here at
the very bottom of the web page there's

122
00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:51.519
some additional roles that were added.

123
00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.923
Those are those extra
divs that I've put in.

124
00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:59.879
They're as tall as their content,
which is like three letters, okay?

125
00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:04.936
Because we didn't specify
where they're supposed to go.

126
00:08:04.936 --> 00:08:07.708
This is again part of that
what's called the implicit grid.

127
00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.377
As you start your re-documentation,
you'll hear about the explicit grid and

128
00:08:11.377 --> 00:08:12.317
the implicit grid.

129
00:08:12.317 --> 00:08:16.824
The explicit grid in this document are
the things that we've actually called out

130
00:08:16.824 --> 00:08:18.489
dimensions for, all right?

131
00:08:18.489 --> 00:08:23.679
And the implicit grid, it's just gonna
continue on trying to fit the additional

132
00:08:23.679 --> 00:08:28.424
items that you add according to
the pattern that you established, okay?

133
00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:34.563
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, cool,
I'm gonna go ahead and take those out,

134
00:08:34.563 --> 00:08:36.404
cuz we don't really actually want those.

135
00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:42.036
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
then the last part of finishing out

136
00:08:42.036 --> 00:08:46.434
the painting here is this,
we just going to add a few colors.

137
00:08:46.434 --> 00:08:52.462
So I'm gonna add a background color
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Of

138
00:08:52.462 --> 00:08:55.587
black to my wrapper here.

139
00:08:58.675 --> 00:09:01.895
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
I'm gonna take out my background image.

140
00:09:01.895 --> 00:09:04.972
So you can either erase that or
you can just comment it out.

141
00:09:09.141 --> 00:09:13.156
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm also gonna
comment out the opacity of the divs,

142
00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:16.814
cuz I want that now at 100%, not at 50%.

143
00:09:19.317 --> 00:09:20.664
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

144
00:09:20.664 --> 00:09:23.150
And then all you have to
do is look at the painting.

145
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:28.370
So c is gonna be red, d is gonna be
blue and g is going to be yellow.

146
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.565
I haven't taken the time to figure
out the exact hex color for these.

147
00:09:31.565 --> 00:09:34.793
I'm just using red, blue and yellow.

148
00:09:34.793 --> 00:09:38.543
But you are certainly welcome to
get your little eyedroppers out and

149
00:09:38.543 --> 00:09:40.994
figure out exactly what
the hex colors are.

150
00:09:40.994 --> 00:09:46.076
So to this, I will simply add,

151
00:09:46.076 --> 00:09:49.008
here on letter c,

152
00:09:49.008 --> 00:09:54.480
a background color of red, on d,

153
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:59.181
a background color of blue.

154
00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:05.253
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
I'll make the text white in there too so

155
00:10:05.253 --> 00:10:07.015
it'll be a little easier to see.

156
00:10:07.015 --> 00:10:14.371
And then finally on g I'll add
a background color of yellow.

157
00:10:18.525 --> 00:10:19.468
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

158
00:10:26.478 --> 00:10:29.493
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
if you go ahead and refresh.

159
00:10:29.493 --> 00:10:32.401
You get something that looks pretty
close to that original painting.
