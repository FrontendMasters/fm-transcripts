&gt;&gt; Jen Krammer: What I'd like for you do
now that we've got you started on this,

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.910
I'd like you to go on ahead and
finish up this grid.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.375
And so what you're gonna do is
continue on in this example.

4
00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.370
So we did row one together.

5
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.994
I'd like you to do rows two through five.

6
00:00:19.994 --> 00:00:23.700
Go on ahead and set up the grid columns,

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.510
and the grid rows, and the classes for all
of the cells that are here on the page.

8
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.480
It's basically gonna look exactly like
what we've already done twice before.

9
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.130
So what we had before
is our float solution.

10
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.190
What we had before is
our flex box solution.

11
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.980
We're just recoding this page again now
with grid as a little bit more practice.
