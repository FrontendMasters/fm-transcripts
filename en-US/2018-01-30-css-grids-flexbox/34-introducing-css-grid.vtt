&gt;&gt; Jen: The first thing I wanna point out
to you is that when I started talking

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.700
about grid,
I started talking about it as CSS 4.

3
00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.480
CSS 4 grid totally awesome,
right, because we've had CSS 1,

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.766
that was the initial specification,
and then we had CSS 2,

5
00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:19.230
2.1, we had CSS 3, so
now we must be on CSS 4, right?

6
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.224
Awesome.

7
00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:24.417
Turns out though there actually is
no CSS4, and I didn't know that, so

8
00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:28.010
now I'm telling everybody
that this is in fact true.

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.370
What the CSS people
have done at the W3C is

10
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.490
they've decided to version various
modules of CSS going forward.

11
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.690
So animation will have its own number,
grid will have its own number flex box,

12
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.550
will have its own number positioning,
will have its own number and so on and

13
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.130
so forth.

14
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.670
So each of these modules in CSS
will have their own number.

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.520
So there is no such thing as CSS for
a grid.

16
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.330
It's just CSS grid.

17
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.650
Please bear that in mind.

18
00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.280
And if you wanna read up on that,
I've given a link here.

19
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.600
Okay.

20
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.075
So, why CSS grid?

21
00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:04.390
You have heard so much about it,
it seems like it's really cool.

22
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.220
So here's some reasons.

23
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.890
First of all,
it is in fact a CSS specification.

24
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.340
So it's gone through the whole process.

25
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.570
It was released as a real,
life thing in March of 2017.

26
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.270
March this year.

27
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.740
And it's incorporated in
all of the latest browsers.

28
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.700
It's been incorporated through a lot
of browser updates at this point.

29
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.010
Edge is coming out with grid this month.

30
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.280
If it's not out already it
will be out in a few days.

31
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.220
So it's adoption rates have
taken off spectacularly.

32
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.820
Relative to the old days where we'd
have something new in CSS, and we'd go,

33
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.530
wow, that's awesome, I can't wait for
five years to go by before I can use that.

34
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.830
You can start to use it now.

35
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.910
So one of the most Interesting parts
of grid is that there is no row

36
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.620
markup we're now starting
to think in two dimensions.

37
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.620
So rather than putting in these
artificial rows on our page and

38
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.350
having cells inside of it, Grid is
a whole two dimensional thing, okay?

39
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.540
So we can specify where things are in
two dimensions any where on our page,

40
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.670
no row markup at all Makes
our HTML nice and clean.

41
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.870
And as I said grid is designed
to work in these two dimensions.

42
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.470
So the overall rule is
gonna be using Flexbox for

43
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.820
those UI elements like image galleries or
cards.

44
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.250
Or there's all kinds of different
UI elements that are like this,

45
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.640
little units of content.

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.540
Your Flexbox are great for those,
but you're gonna use grid for

47
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.960
your major layout of you webpage.

48
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.120
Okay?
You're gonna get lots of

49
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.060
examples of this today.
