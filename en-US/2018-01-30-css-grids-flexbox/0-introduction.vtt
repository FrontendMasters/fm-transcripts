00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.290
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Hello everybody online,

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.780
hello everyone in class,
I'm really glad to be here.

3
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.500
My name is Jen Kramer.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.290
I've been working in this field for 17
years, which predates CSS in the browser.

5
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.590
When I started we were doing all table
based layout, Macromedia DreamWeaver 3,

6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.190
and we've moved on from that,
thank goodness.

7
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.850
So we're finally getting
to some of the first

8
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.810
true layout tools that we've ever had.

9
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.120
[LAUGH] Only took 17 years for
us to get away from these hacks.

10
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.300
My background,
I have been a freelancer for many years.

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.980
I had my own web design firm for

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.310
a while, I sold that,
I now work pretty strictly in education.

13
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.310
I am a lecturer at
Harvard University Extension School,

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.006
where I teach in the digital
media design program.

15
00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:48.617
You can get a Master's degree,
for the most part,

16
00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:51.390
wholly online from anywhere in the world.

17
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.045
I also make videos for

18
00:00:53.045 --> 00:00:57.900
Linda.com and I've just had one
released yesterday on Foundation Six.

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.130
And I've done some work
with O'Reilly as well, and

20
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.720
you can follow me on Twitter @jen4web,
J E N, number 4, W E B.

21
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.040
So what we're gonna be talking about
today is going to be just Flexbox, and

22
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.120
we're gonna talk about basically
the big overview as this follows.

23
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.170
We're gonna start off talking a little
bit about floats, we wanna review what

24
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.340
the current standard is for
working with layout on the web.

25
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.370
It'll be brief,
no more than an hour focused on floats.

26
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.370
Then we're gonna move into Flexbox.

27
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.340
We're gonna look at Flexbox as a tool.

28
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.110
We're gonna look at all of
its various properties and

29
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.280
some of the values that go with it,
and understand how Flexbox works.

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.820
Then we're gonna go into
Flexbox used as a grid system,

31
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.650
which unfortunately is a hack.

32
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.050
Sorry everybody, Flexbox is not really
designed to be used to layout whole

33
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.330
webpages, it's actually designed to layout
things like image galleries and so forth.

34
00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.230
But we are gonna take a look at
it as a grid system, because

35
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.130
Flexbox has become integrated into a whole
bunch of responsive design frameworks.

36
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.018
It is the way Bootstrap 4 is working for
its layout, Foundation Six.

37
00:02:12.018 --> 00:02:14.920
You like hit three, and
we can go on and on from there.

38
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.980
Towards the end of the day we're
gonna look at Flexbox, and

39
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.150
we're gonna do a lot of practice work with
it, getting really comfortable with it.

40
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.620
Tomorrow we're gonna go into CSS Grid.

41
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.790
At that point in time we will be
laying out lots of pages with Grid.

42
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.409
We'll talk about browser
compatibility issues with Grid.

43
00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.219
And then towards the end of that day we'll
start to talk about how we integrate

44
00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.960
Grid with Flexbox in the correct way for
laying out webpages going forward.
