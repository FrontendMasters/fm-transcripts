00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.310
&gt;&gt; Jen: So this is another you try
it where you're gonna be working

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.560
with something as your own.

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.050
So I'm gonna get you started here with
this and show you how this works.

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.760
So we spent an entire day working
with flexbox as a hack, right?

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.510
That was that whole grid thing.

6
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.250
But we did complete one exercise
where we used flexbox as we

7
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.380
should laying out an image gallery, right?

8
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.660
So in this exercise we wanna
combine yesterday's flexbox

9
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.440
image gallery with the grid
layout of today's webpage.

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.310
So what I've given you here in your begin
folder for chapter 17 is two things.

11
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.880
One is yesterday's flex box
gallery exercise, okay?

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.792
So you've got,
&gt;&gt; Jen: The gallery all

13
00:00:40.792 --> 00:00:44.130
by itself okay, and
that bit of HTML and CSS.

14
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.288
And also you have a folder here for
the pie and history

15
00:00:51.288 --> 00:00:55.710
page laid out as grid, which you can use
the one if you just coded that up and

16
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.940
you wanna use that, that's totally fine.

17
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.940
Or you can use mine,
&gt;&gt; Jen: And mine looks like this, okay.

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.450
So we're gonna put these
two things together so

19
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.300
that you wind up with a gallery page.

20
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.326
I'll show you what that looks like as

21
00:01:13.326 --> 00:01:18.621
well.
&gt;&gt; Jen: So

22
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.340
we built one of these
yesterday in flexbox.

23
00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.650
This is the pie gallery now.

24
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.500
The rest of the page is
laid out using grid, but

25
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.407
the these images in the middle
are laid out using flexbox, all right?

26
00:01:31.407 --> 00:01:36.400
And you'll see here that they change their
layout depending on the screen size, okay?
