00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.760
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Are there any outstanding
remaining questions on Flexbox or

2
00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.550
Grid or layout?

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.530
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Are you absolutely
sure that Flexbox and

4
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.650
Grid's CSS work 100% with
Google Chrome and Edge?

5
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.077
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That they will
work in Chrome and Edge or

6
00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:20.004
that they do work in Chrome and Edge?

7
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:22.564
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: They do work in Chrome and
Edge.

8
00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:26.010
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I am 100% certain
that grid works in Chrome.

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.550
I'm 99% certain it works in Edge.

10
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.080
If it's not today, it is this month.

11
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.060
Edge is supposed to
come online this month.

12
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:42.101
We can check, can I use,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So let's see here.

13
00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:45.154
Here's my page,

14
00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:50.013
can I use
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah

15
00:00:50.013 --> 00:00:54.040
it's a maroon, partial support.

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.789
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so as you see here I
guess the current version of Edge is Edge

17
00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.743
15 Edge 16 is the next version,
it is scheduled to come online and

18
00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:06.517
be completely cross browser compatible,
so it's coming, it's coming and I have

19
00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:10.980
read that Edge is supposed to be out
this month, I don't know the exact date.

20
00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:15.725
Fabulous, thank you all so much for
sticking with me for the last two days.

21
00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:17.185
I appreciate it very much.

22
00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:19.935
I appreciate it it takes a lot
of time out of your day and

23
00:01:19.935 --> 00:01:21.485
a lot of time away from clients and

24
00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:25.525
other things that you have to do to
come and attend a training like this.

25
00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:28.705
I'm glad that you have found it valuable.

26
00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:32.145
If you like me here,
you may also like me elsewhere.

27
00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:37.800
I'll go ahead and put up my contact
information as a last slide here.

28
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.020
So this is how you can contact me,
if you wanna get in touch with me.

29
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.410
And you can follow me on Twitter,
you can follow me on Facebook.

30
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.220
And thank you very much,
it's my first front end masters class.

31
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.850
I had a blast, it was super fun
being here with all of you, and

32
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.020
I hope to see you again
some time in the future.

33
00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.325
Thank you very much.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:01.739
