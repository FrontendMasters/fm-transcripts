&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I’m gonna show you again
what this page looks like here at

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.630
desktop dimensions, okay.

3
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.550
So this is the way it looks
at desktop dimensions.

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.746
What I’d like for
you to do in the final media query,

5
00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:15.510
which is actually already all spelled
out with the correct syntax here.

6
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.780
Take like two minutes, and
what I'd like for you to do is use

7
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.710
the grid template area's property
to spell out this display, okay?

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.130
At the desktop dimension.

9
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.840
Go ahead and do that now.

10
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.360
Erase what's there and
put in grid template areas and

11
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.200
spell out what that
layout should look like.
