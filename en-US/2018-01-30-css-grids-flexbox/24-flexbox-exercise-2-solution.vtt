00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.911
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What went well,
what seemed to work okay, and or

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:04.409
where did you get stuck?

3
00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:07.077
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I had some
little margin problems.

4
00:00:07.077 --> 00:00:08.035
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You had
some margin problems?

5
00:00:08.035 --> 00:00:08.729
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: That I had
just kinda turn around.

6
00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:09.503
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

7
00:00:09.503 --> 00:00:14.169
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And the only difference
I can see between our two pages is

8
00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.544
the testimonials goes up and
down just a little bit.

9
00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:19.567
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Just a tiny little bit.

10
00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:20.526
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Right.

11
00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:23.562
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If we had infinite time,
we could tweak until perfection, right?

12
00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:26.205
Yeah, okay,
I'm not gonna worry about that,

13
00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:30.583
that the testimonials are a little higher
or a little lower depending, okay?

14
00:00:30.583 --> 00:00:33.981
How about everybody else?

15
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:34.658
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Same.

16
00:00:34.658 --> 00:00:35.869
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Same,

17
00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.451
it's basically just the testimonials and
where they fit in the space?

18
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:41.986
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah,
in relation to the inside of the text.

19
00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:44.324
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
that in relation to the text?

20
00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.303
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Fair enough, okay, so

21
00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:49.214
I tend not to be that much
of a perfectionist and

22
00:00:49.214 --> 00:00:51.239
sort of let things like that go.

23
00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.254
Obviously, if you had lots of
design time remaining with this, so

24
00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.414
you would sit there and tweak away.

25
00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:01.577
But I question how much you're
actually gonna learn by doing that.

26
00:01:01.577 --> 00:01:06.518
[LAUGH] So I'll show you my answer here
which is what you can follow along

27
00:01:06.518 --> 00:01:08.640
here in the end folder.

28
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.580
So if you look in the end folder,
this is what my solution look like.

29
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.149
So I had some things going on here.

30
00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:18.998
I have a class here.

31
00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:22.121
I've left the rows in place.

32
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:25.867
The ul of the navigation,
I gave it a class of full-width.

33
00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:28.139
So I created a new class
called full-width.

34
00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:33.102
Because what I found with the row that
I had existing, it didn't stretch quite

35
00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:38.003
all the way across and I think I had a
little bit of a gap on either side, right?

36
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:39.807
A little 4% margin gap,

37
00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:44.654
it wasn't lining up well as I recall
when I put the solution together.

38
00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:49.900
So I created a class to get
around that particular problem.

39
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.073
The thing that's really notable here for

40
00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:56.796
me is the way that I handle
the sidebar over here.

41
00:01:56.796 --> 00:02:03.135
So of course, the main content of this
has got an article with a class of col-3.

42
00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.386
That's no different than what we've
already looked at with the grid system

43
00:02:06.386 --> 00:02:07.830
that we prototyped.

44
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.760
But here with my sidebar,
what I wound up doing

45
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.550
was this div, I put a div around the side
or maybe that was already there.

46
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:24.560
But I've changed its classes so
that it's both a flex item and a flex row.

47
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.460
[LAUGH] See how I do that?

48
00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.010
So I have the flex item, the col-1-4.

49
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.570
And it's also a row and
this sides become the flex items.

50
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.940
So basically, I have a little bit
of a nested grid going on here.

51
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.255
Does that make sense?

52
00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:48.225
Okay, so then if we take a look at the CSS
associated with that particular piece,

53
00:02:48.225 --> 00:02:52.905
cuz I think that's the one sort of area
that had a level of difficulty to this.

54
00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:54.602
Is that fair to say?

55
00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:58.716
Pretty much everything else was pretty
straightforward on this example.

56
00:02:58.716 --> 00:03:01.449
So let's look at the CSS and
how I dealt with that.

57
00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.086
I'll start down here at the desktop.

58
00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.015
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So at the desktop,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I have a flex

59
00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:18.380
item that's the sidebar with 100% width,
okay?

60
00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.020
So instead of it being 92% that
had a margin on either side,

61
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.460
it didn't really want that in this case.

62
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.856
So I give it a flex-basis of 100%.

63
00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:32.953
In the tablet portion of this,
I added that,

64
00:03:32.953 --> 00:03:38.867
that the flex-basis was going to be 44%,
okay?

65
00:03:41.518 --> 00:03:45.496
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then,
up here in the mobile styles,

66
00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:51.938
outside of the media queries,
I have a flex-basis of 100%.

67
00:03:51.938 --> 00:03:55.871
And I added a bit of
margin with this as well.

68
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:59.382
Okay, so then, when you display the page,

69
00:04:05.818 --> 00:04:06.438
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then,

70
00:04:08.678 --> 00:04:10.014
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We shrink it down,

71
00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:15.443
we hit our breakpoint, then I wind up
with my two boxes underneath like this.

72
00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:20.339
And then everything should stack
on top of each other at some point

73
00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:21.770
in time like that.

74
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.913
And I put in some extra padding here,
because I thought it looked nicer, and

75
00:04:25.913 --> 00:04:29.309
you know, stuff like that,
little design considerations.

76
00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.276
Does that make sense to everybody?

77
00:04:31.276 --> 00:04:34.329
What I did and why?

78
00:04:34.329 --> 00:04:37.370
Do we have anybody else who did
a different approach who'd like to share?

79
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.940
I'm not saying I have a lock on
the perfect way of doing this, or

80
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.200
even the only way of doing it.

81
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:51.136
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: My said she used your,
col-classes, and then used flex with it.

82
00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:54.459
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct, yes, absolutely,
you could use the same classes that were

83
00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:58.309
already there from the floats, and you
just repurpose them all to be flex-box.

84
00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.419
You get rid of the float part,
you get rid of the width part, and

85
00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.372
then replace those with
the appropriate flex properties.

86
00:05:04.372 --> 00:05:06.150
That's definitely a way of doing that.

87
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.840
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What happened
with the pizza image?

88
00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.471
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: With the pizza image.

89
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:11.862
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It's a trick question.

90
00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:14.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: It had breaks on the lower.

91
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.815
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You mean the pie
of the month down here?

92
00:05:16.815 --> 00:05:18.407
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

93
00:05:18.407 --> 00:05:19.585
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Is that
what we're talking about?

94
00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:20.463
The pie of the month?

95
00:05:20.463 --> 00:05:22.551
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: When you
shrink the viewport.

96
00:05:22.551 --> 00:05:24.068
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which of course
is pie day pie, ha ha ha.

97
00:05:24.068 --> 00:05:25.049
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, the pie.

98
00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:27.343
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: These are all
numbers all over it.

99
00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.130
So when you shrink it,
what's going on with this?

100
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.840
Is that the question?

101
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.605
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Only at the image.

102
00:05:36.904 --> 00:05:41.846
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So yeah, so since this
is flex-box, the boxes are stretching.

103
00:05:41.846 --> 00:05:45.085
The testimonial box is stretching
to accommodate the content here.

104
00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:48.876
So of course, the pie box here
is also going to stretch, right?

105
00:05:48.876 --> 00:05:51.603
The border's gonna stretch, but
of course, the image is not.

106
00:05:51.603 --> 00:05:52.887
So that's what's going on here.

107
00:05:52.887 --> 00:05:54.559
Does that help?

108
00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:55.574
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah, I think so.

109
00:05:55.574 --> 00:06:01.567
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's

110
00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:03.426
put it to this dimension here.

111
00:06:03.426 --> 00:06:08.186
So you'll notice that we have this
space over here on the side as well

112
00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:12.122
that comes from,
I had a style in here that locked down.

113
00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:17.426
It might have been
outside the media query.

114
00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:21.673
That locked down this,
the maximum size of those images to 225 or

115
00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.784
250 pixels, did sort of a hack.

116
00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:26.984
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Search for it.

117
00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:39.495
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, okay, that's one of
them, that's the article image, and yeah,

118
00:06:39.495 --> 00:06:41.550
so here's the sidebar images.

119
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.310
And you see here that I've
rounded some of the corners,

120
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.910
width of 100%, but
a max width of 250 pixels.

121
00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:56.142
And so this is a hack for leads
beautifully until a chapter from now.

122
00:06:56.142 --> 00:07:04.419
So this is a hack to make the images scale
as we make the page larger or smaller.

123
00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:06.345
Because they can go, quote,

124
00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:10.594
100% of the container width up
to a maximum of 250 pixels.

125
00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:13.213
And at that point it
stops enlarging those.
