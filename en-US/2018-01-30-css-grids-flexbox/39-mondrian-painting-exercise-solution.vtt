&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So you should have
something that looks kinda like this.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.480
Again, the right shape,
the wrong distribution of those shapes,

3
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.400
they aren't the right heights and
widths and so forth.

4
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.300
But you can see that the shape of
the boxes that we've specified here

5
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.550
match the shape of the painting.

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.110
So did everybody here in the classroom,

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.540
did you manage to get
an answer look like that?

8
00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.390
All the heads are nodding, okay.

9
00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.040
So my CSS code looks something like this.

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.790
So we have a series of the row,
I guess for lack of a better term,

11
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.630
row spans and call spans, right?

12
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.540
So we have a whole series of these,
d through g.
