00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.695
&gt;&gt; Jen: So we had our painting here,
and while I was working on this for

2
00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:09.390
the answer I started to put this together,
and then it was only

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.469
later that I realized the d is
actually slightly shorter than b is.

4
00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.400
Did anybody else get tripped up by that?

5
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.327
b and
d are not exactly the same height, so

6
00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:25.610
there's an extra row in there perhaps
that you might not have factored in.

7
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.345
That was sort of the one tricky thing
that I found about this, so I did manage

8
00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:37.464
to get mine looking like this,
maybe yours is somewhat close to that.

9
00:00:40.693 --> 00:00:42.672
&gt;&gt; Jen: No, Casey's shaking her head, no.

10
00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:43.580
&gt;&gt; Casey: Not yet.

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.753
&gt;&gt; Jen: Not yet, okay.

12
00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:48.273
Casey needs some more time, and
she's totally gonna get it.

13
00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:53.204
I know Brady got it, Jackie, you got it.

14
00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:55.080
Has anybody else get it?

15
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.902
Amy got it, Peter?

16
00:00:56.902 --> 00:00:57.633
&gt;&gt; Peter: I was pretty close.

17
00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:58.235
&gt;&gt; Jen: Pretty close?

18
00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:58.745
&gt;&gt; Peter: Yeah.

19
00:00:58.745 --> 00:00:59.605
&gt;&gt; Jen: Awesome.

20
00:00:59.605 --> 00:01:04.284
Okay, so
here is what the answer looked like here.

21
00:01:04.284 --> 00:01:07.085
The HTML, basically nothing changed.

22
00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:11.916
And then in the CSS here, so
it's basically the same thing

23
00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:16.946
that I already showed you
previously in terms of the formulas

24
00:01:16.946 --> 00:01:21.180
to what types of properties
that I have in here.

25
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.950
The values are obviously different for
this particular painting.

26
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.460
So I gave you the width and
the height for the wrapper.

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.470
I made the font size nice and big,
and then we have our display grid.

28
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.438
These were the measurements that I came
up with for the grid template rows and

29
00:01:38.438 --> 00:01:42.598
the grid template columns, and your
measurements may be slightly different.

30
00:01:42.598 --> 00:01:47.296
I don't profess to be super extra
careful as I made those measurements,

31
00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:49.076
but they are pretty close.

32
00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:52.539
The grid gap is about five
pixels in this case, and

33
00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.928
I set the background color
to black eventually.

34
00:01:55.928 --> 00:02:01.790
And then, for each one of my grid columns,
in this case it did go through.

35
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.735
I take my little eye dropper, and figure
out exactly the shade of red, blue, and

36
00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:10.810
yellow that I had here, so
those values are reflected here.

37
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.540
If you just said red, blue, or yellow is
your color keyword, that's totally fine.

38
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.620
So you'll see here how I set up
my grid rows on my grid columns,

39
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.540
pretty much as you might expect,
all right?

40
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.840
So probably you all would have gotten
it with just a little bit more time.

41
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.353
It's really nice to know that you
now have this in your back pocket,

42
00:02:35.353 --> 00:02:41.380
that you can create some really wacked-out
lay out with Grid, that's pretty amazing.

43
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.530
I think in my solution here that
my end statement for number nine,

44
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.230
let me just check this real
quick before I start talking.

45
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.102
I did.

46
00:02:52.102 --> 00:02:55.669
One of the things I did here for
number nine, [COUGH] and

47
00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.242
I'm gonna point this out
as an interesting problem.

48
00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:03.833
So I'm gonna go back to chapter 9, which
was the painting that we coded together.

49
00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:10.168
&gt;&gt; Jen: If I show that in the browser,
that was the answer that we got earlier.

50
00:03:10.168 --> 00:03:15.510
I actually wrote some media
queries to go along with this.

51
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.920
And so with my Harvard students, when we
do this, we actually take the painting and

52
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.610
flip it upside down, and code it upside
down on a different media query.

53
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.870
Here's an interesting thing that
I've noticed about this when

54
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.230
working here in my browser.

55
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.490
As I start to narrow things down,
it doesn't look like there's any

56
00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.910
responsiveness at all in
this particular painting.

57
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.840
What I actually wind up having to do,
and I'm here in Firefox,

58
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.590
you have to right click somewhere and
you go to Inspect Element.

59
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.520
And then, what I wind up having to do is

60
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.219
showing the mobile dimensions like this,
and then you can see the media queries.

61
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.230
I'm not sure why this is, but
it seems to be the way things are.

62
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.090
And so for this media query I
flipped the painting upside down,

63
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.310
I made the background color green to
show you that I actually did that.

64
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.966
So I'll just point that
out to you in the CSS.

65
00:04:13.595 --> 00:04:17.944
&gt;&gt; Jen: So outside of the media query
here, and this, again, is chapter 9,

66
00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:21.790
we're back to painting.css
in the end state.

67
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.570
Outside the media query is sort
of the default desktop values, so

68
00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.460
this is not a mobile-first design.

69
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.220
Use the desktop values that we have here.

70
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.180
Then you have a media query here where
I've actually flipped this over, and so

71
00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.095
you can see I've just coded
different locations for

72
00:04:38.095 --> 00:04:40.420
those boxes in the media query.

73
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.023
And then,

74
00:04:41.023 --> 00:04:47.197
when I get down here to the bottom,
&gt;&gt; Jen: The very bottom of this,

75
00:04:47.197 --> 00:04:49.062
notice what I've done here.

76
00:04:49.062 --> 00:04:53.665
All I did for my media query, for
the small dimension, was this,

77
00:04:53.665 --> 00:04:55.936
I just said, display: block.

78
00:04:55.936 --> 00:05:00.468
In other words I just disabled display:
grid altogether, so I'll just have these

79
00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:04.881
boxes stacked on top of each other, so
we're no longer dealing with grid at all.

80
00:05:04.881 --> 00:05:09.500
And the background color in this case,
is orange, just to show you that it works.

81
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.060
And if I change the dimensions
here in this view in Firefox,

82
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.000
and you can see that in
fact that's what happens,

83
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.180
we just have the boxes stack
on top of each other, okay?

84
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.150
So this might be something to keep in
mind, that you may have to come in here

85
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.620
in order to test your
various grid layouts, okay?

86
00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.310
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Question from Josiah.

87
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.890
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Is there any

88
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.880
reason to not use a span?

89
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.930
&gt;&gt; Jen: There's absolutely
no reason not to use a span.

90
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.590
So one of the alternative syntaxes for
the grid template, sorry, for

91
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.420
the grid rows and the grid columns,

92
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.370
is to use the keyword span, so
1 / span 2 or something like that.

93
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.080
You can totally do it that way
instead of specifying the two numbers.

94
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.540
From my perspective they do
pretty much the same thing,

95
00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.900
and I'm lazy, and would prefer not
to type all those extra letters.

96
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.980
But if you prefer that type of syntax,
you're more than welcome to use it.

97
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.451
My teaching philosophy on this has always
been that I can really confuse everybody

98
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:14.186
in the room by throwing
everything at you at once.

99
00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:19.039
I'd rather have you focus on one syntax
and get to know it really well, and

100
00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:24.146
then at a later point in time you can
pick up the other syntaxes really easily.

101
00:06:24.146 --> 00:06:27.076
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Stacy said,
just a comment, she said,

102
00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:31.987
I put the maximum column row value
as a note about each div selector,

103
00:06:31.987 --> 00:06:35.540
that seemed to help,
because counting is hard.

104
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.324
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, counting is hard, and
so she did some commenting for that.

105
00:06:39.324 --> 00:06:42.391
That's awesome,
comments are always welcome.

106
00:06:42.391 --> 00:06:47.414
I've never heard from any developer
that code is not commented enough,

107
00:06:47.414 --> 00:06:51.462
and I believe we're all guilty
of not commenting enough.

108
00:06:51.462 --> 00:06:56.350
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Julian's asking, why did she

109
00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.230
use the min device width
in the media queries?

110
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.436
&gt;&gt; Jen: The minimum device
width in the media queries.

111
00:07:06.436 --> 00:07:09.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: That's why the resizing
doesn't work normal, I guess.

112
00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:10.990
&gt;&gt; Jen: Is that why
the resizing doesn't work?

113
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.890
That could very well be.

114
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.610
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Instead of just min what?

115
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:15.910
&gt;&gt; Jen: So just take out the device, and

116
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.600
then it's gonna work again,
is what he's suggesting?

117
00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.240
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Yeah.

118
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.240
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, so let's try that.

119
00:07:27.611 --> 00:07:29.651
&gt;&gt; Jen: Oops, get the HTML.

120
00:07:34.376 --> 00:07:37.621
&gt;&gt; Jen: Cool, thanks for
that tip, I didn't know that.

121
00:07:37.621 --> 00:07:39.556
Awesome, thank you very much.
