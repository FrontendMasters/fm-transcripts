00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.760
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now that you
have seen Flexbox in action,

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.170
you get to do one of my
favorite things of all time.

3
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.740
There are two games that are available
out there, believe it or

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.020
not, some of you may be
familiar with these.

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.718
One is called Flexbox Froggie,
the other one is called Flexbox Defense.

6
00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:18.074
I'll pull these up in
a browser tab right now.

7
00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:22.102
And what I'd like for you to do is
pick a game and to go on ahead and

8
00:00:22.102 --> 00:00:26.840
try playing it, and if you have time
go on ahead and do both of these.

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.580
And if you don't have time then do as
much as you can on one of these games.

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.090
So let me show you what
these games look like, and

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.680
then I'll put the slide back up so
you have the URLs.

12
00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.180
So Flexbox Froggy looks like this.

13
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.290
You have a little froggy.

14
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.900
You have a little lily pad here.

15
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.690
You're at level one here, and
you're gonna write some code to put

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.160
the froggy here onto the lily pad.

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.270
So they've suggested here
that you're going to use, for

18
00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.610
example in this first one,
use the justify content property.

19
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.660
Here's some possible values, for

20
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.890
example, using justify content flex
end will move the frog to the right.

21
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.158
So if we said, justify-content,

22
00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:20.700
flex-end,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Our froggie jumps onto

23
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.620
the lily pad.

24
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.590
Isn't that adorable?

25
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.150
And if we said something different like,
justify-content: center,

26
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.690
then our froggie might move but
he doesn't make the lily pad, okay.

27
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.580
So that's one possible game.

28
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.046
The other one is Flexbox Defense.

29
00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:44.891
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] And so
as this one will tell you,

30
00:01:44.891 --> 00:01:47.609
this is working with Flexbox.

31
00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:52.464
And what's gonna happen is you have little
guns and you have the little armies or

32
00:01:52.464 --> 00:01:57.680
whatever running down a particular path,
and you're gonna try to take them out.

33
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.690
Little bit more violent
than the little froggies.

34
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.070
So same kind of thing here.

35
00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.010
So here's your guns.

36
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.760
You want to position them
somewhere on this path

37
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.520
such that it's gonna take out the little
things that come down the path.

38
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.070
It's saying,

39
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.360
use the justify content property to
move these two towers into position.

40
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.196
So if I said, for example,
justify-content: center,

41
00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:27.736
perhaps, and then start the wave.

42
00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.573
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So the little
things are gonna come down here.

43
00:02:34.573 --> 00:02:37.982
The little guns are gonna shoot at them,
and

44
00:02:37.982 --> 00:02:42.554
hopefully we take them all
out before they go by.

45
00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:43.990
There we go.

46
00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:49.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yay, we win.

47
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.000
And then we go on to the next one.

48
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.610
All right, so I'd like you to go on ahead
and try out one of these two games so

49
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.650
that will give you some practice
with these properties and

50
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.860
values that we just went through.
