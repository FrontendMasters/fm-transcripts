00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.598
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In that folder, for seven
wrap up, we're gonna do the following.

2
00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:05.497
There is the original picture of Merilee.

3
00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:08.220
Merilee Wilbure,
the founder of Pie in the Sky Bakery.

4
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.264
What I'd like for you to do is
to take that original picture.

5
00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:15.324
Make three different sizes that
you can use on your website.

6
00:00:15.324 --> 00:00:18.742
Put them on the history.html page
that you've already worked on.

7
00:00:18.742 --> 00:00:20.238
You re-coded it in flexbox.

8
00:00:20.238 --> 00:00:22.144
And then use the picture tag and

9
00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:25.152
picturefill in order to make it all work,
okay?

10
00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:26.501
So you've got that image in place.

11
00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:30.380
Then, you should be able to
take the finished image gallery

12
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.891
from the 5-image-gallery folder,
and put that on another page.

13
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.539
Call it Gallery,
the Pie in the Sky Gallery.

14
00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:40.676
So we take that image gallery,
we already coded by itself.

15
00:00:40.676 --> 00:00:45.870
Now we're gonna drop it on into
the rest of the website, okay?

16
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.349
And if you have extra time, you're more
than welcome to create a homepage as well.

17
00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:54.582
And so just so you're aware,
there is a folder up here called branding.

18
00:00:54.582 --> 00:00:59.812
In the branding folder,
there are background images, fonts.

19
00:00:59.812 --> 00:01:06.108
Examples of fonts from the PDF that I
used here, a site comp, some web copy.

20
00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:07.737
So anything that you want here.

21
00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:11.264
And I'll just show you real
quick what my results look like.

22
00:01:16.137 --> 00:01:20.180
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
here is my image gallery page, okay?

23
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.165
So I chose one of my flexbox solutions
here, the neater looking of them, and

24
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:28.239
dropped it in as a Pie Gallery page.

25
00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:33.707
Here's my history page and
Marilee is a little bit bigger, all right?

26
00:01:33.707 --> 00:01:40.797
And we adjusted the projector, so
she's even nicer looking, so there we go.

27
00:01:40.797 --> 00:01:42.327
Different size pictures there for Marilee.

28
00:01:42.327 --> 00:01:45.118
And then I also added a homepage.

29
00:01:45.118 --> 00:01:48.608
And on my homepage,
I got the picture of the pie buffet and

30
00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.296
put it on up here on the top.

31
00:01:50.296 --> 00:01:52.876
Underneath we've got little boxes,

32
00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:57.154
which I think are required by
law now on all homepages, right?

33
00:01:57.154 --> 00:02:00.646
And if we go on ahead and
scrunch this down,

34
00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:06.179
then you can see that we change our
layouts and so forth, all right?
