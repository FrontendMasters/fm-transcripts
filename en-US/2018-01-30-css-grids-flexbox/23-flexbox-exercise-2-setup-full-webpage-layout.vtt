00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The next thing to
do is to take this real world,

2
00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.060
now that we've done all this work on pie.

3
00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.374
What I'd like for
you to do next is the following.

4
00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.463
We're gonna move on here
to folder number four.

5
00:00:10.463 --> 00:00:15.195
This is gonna be an exercise that is

6
00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:20.425
very real world in a lot of cases, so.

7
00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:23.098
This is the Pie in the Sky web site.

8
00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:25.894
The colors are horrendous
on this projector.

9
00:00:25.894 --> 00:00:29.661
Trust me that they're way better on
the computer that's in front of you.

10
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:31.516
Hoo, those are bad colors.

11
00:00:31.516 --> 00:00:37.389
So if you take a look at this, this is
actually laid out currently using floats.

12
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.550
So this is a full webpage that's laid
out with floats, and what I'd like for

13
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.230
you to do now, is I'd like for you to
take, basically, the grid system that you

14
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.440
just wrote with Flexbox, and I'd like you
to apply it to this particular webpage.

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.768
So you're gonna need to think about
how exactly you're gonna lay this

16
00:00:56.768 --> 00:00:59.994
out differently,
using with your Flexbox styles,

17
00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:04.264
and classes, going ahead, and
apply them to this particular page.

18
00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:10.564
And basically, the end result should look
exactly like this, but it should be coded

19
00:01:10.564 --> 00:01:15.637
with Flexbox in a Grid system,
instead of being coded with floats.

20
00:01:15.637 --> 00:01:23.894
So that's the desktop.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here is the tablet size.

21
00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:25.781
We've got these guys stacked underneath.

22
00:01:25.781 --> 00:01:29.646
And then, finally, of course,
is mobile, all right?

23
00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:31.971
With everything stacked
on top of each other.

24
00:01:31.971 --> 00:01:35.165
Normally, you might go to a hamburger
button here on the navigation.

25
00:01:35.165 --> 00:01:38.693
In the interest of keeping JavaScript
out of things, I've just gone ahead and

26
00:01:38.693 --> 00:01:42.670
changed the order here of the navigation
to work with fat fingers.

27
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.010
So let's go ahead, and take,
let's say, a half an hour?

28
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.510
Sound good?

29
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.920
Then, go on ahead and
hack up at this page, and

30
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.480
this is all in folder number four,
chapter four, and

31
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.087
the name of that folder
is pie 4-pie-flexbox.

32
00:02:00.087 --> 00:02:01.407
Have fun.
