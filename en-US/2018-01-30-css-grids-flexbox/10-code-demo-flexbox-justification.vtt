00:00:00.127 --> 00:00:04.576
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I usually find when I learn
new syntax it's helpful to determine what

2
00:00:04.576 --> 00:00:07.260
each little property
is doing on its own so

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.649
that you can think about
things more holistically.

4
00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:14.711
[COUGH] All right, so then, number 5.

5
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:19.788
We're gonna start to think about how
we can put these boxes on the row and

6
00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:23.013
how we,
the term is called justify content.

7
00:00:23.013 --> 00:00:27.593
And as I say here, the justify
content is determining distribution

8
00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:31.946
of the flex items withing the flex
container on the main access.

9
00:00:31.946 --> 00:00:36.985
So the flex items are the little boxes, on
the main access which in our case is row,

10
00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:39.851
so horizontally, how are they distributed?

11
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:45.964
Because they don't necessarily
take up all of the space,

12
00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:52.216
if I go back to my CSS and
I set my flex flow to row wrap, okay?

13
00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:58.520
And not add anything new, what I have here
of course are a series of boxes, right?

14
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.991
And some of you designers out
there are looking at this and

15
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:07.293
like, well we've got all
this hanging rag on the end.

16
00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:10.005
I guess we'd call that a rag
if we were looking at this and

17
00:01:10.005 --> 00:01:11.405
it was a paragraph, right?

18
00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.854
What if I don't want a rag like this?

19
00:01:13.854 --> 00:01:18.380
What if I wanna distribute the space
in between these boxes differently?

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.037
And that's what justify
content is all about.

21
00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:27.506
[COUGH] So what we're gonna do
here is we'll add justify-content,

22
00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:34.780
and there's a bunch of possible values for
justify-content, all right?

23
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.933
So flex-start is the default,
so everything's pushed

24
00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:43.353
to the left side in those boxes
just the way that you just saw.

25
00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:51.036
If we said, flex-end, anyone wanna
guess what happens with our boxes then?

26
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.005
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What do you
think flex-end is going to do?

27
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.490
A flex-start lines
everything up on the left,

28
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.610
what do you think flex-end is gonna do?

29
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.377
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Align it to the right.

30
00:02:00.377 --> 00:02:03.068
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Line them up on the right,
okay?

31
00:02:03.068 --> 00:02:07.574
So if we save that,
look at that in the browser,

32
00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:11.750
there they are lined up on the right,
okay?

33
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.861
If we said, center, anyone want
to guess what center is gonna do?

34
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:18.834
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Put them in the center.

35
00:02:18.834 --> 00:02:20.856
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Put them in the center.

36
00:02:20.856 --> 00:02:27.166
So if we refresh our page there's
all of our nice boxes centered.

37
00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:31.261
My gosh, isn't that amazing?

38
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:33.410
We have boxes that are the width
of the content and

39
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.938
the browser's doing the math for you,
aligning them in the center of the page.

40
00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:39.989
You are not able to do this with
any other technology that you

41
00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.343
have at your finger tips.

42
00:02:41.343 --> 00:02:45.970
This is totally awesome and
the code was easy, okay?

43
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.141
So, this is part of what makes
flex-box awesome, all right?

44
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:53.919
Now, comes the one that I find confusing,
all right?

45
00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.615
Because I get confused by the words.

46
00:02:56.615 --> 00:03:00.321
Space between, space around,
and space evenly.

47
00:03:00.321 --> 00:03:02.598
So, let's take a look at
all of those individually.

48
00:03:02.598 --> 00:03:09.378
So space-between
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] So

49
00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:12.598
what this is gonna do is
it's gonna take these boxes,

50
00:03:12.598 --> 00:03:15.824
it's gonna shove them all
the way to the ends, okay?

51
00:03:15.824 --> 00:03:20.942
All the way to the left,
all the way to the right.

52
00:03:20.942 --> 00:03:24.304
It's gonna do the math,
how big are the boxes in between?

53
00:03:24.304 --> 00:03:25.481
What are they doing?

54
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.848
And then it takes whatever
space is left over and

55
00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:32.647
evenly assigns it in between
those remaining boxes.

56
00:03:32.647 --> 00:03:35.984
So you see once again,
over here all the way over on the left,

57
00:03:35.984 --> 00:03:40.181
all the way over on the right, we don't
have any margin over there, right?

58
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:42.530
We're shoved all the way
up against the edge.

59
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.477
But in between these boxes we
have a space that is the same.

60
00:03:48.477 --> 00:03:52.367
And the second row looks like a great
big huge honking space because it is,

61
00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:55.957
that's just the way our boxes happen
to be working in this example.

62
00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:57.971
If we shrink this down a little bit,

63
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.340
we wind up with a slightly
different distribution, okay?

64
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.001
So that's space-between.

65
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.769
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Space-around,

66
00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.749
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Space-around does it this

67
00:04:15.749 --> 00:04:17.333
way, okay?

68
00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:20.304
So what just happened here?

69
00:04:20.304 --> 00:04:25.926
If you take a look at this space
here to the left of box 1 and

70
00:04:25.926 --> 00:04:32.834
the space in between box 1 and 2,
and the space to the right of box 4,

71
00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:39.077
that's about half of the space
in between box 3 and 4, okay?

72
00:04:39.077 --> 00:04:43.659
So we're taking a little bit of
the space and placing it on the left and

73
00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.145
the right side of the box
where two boxes intersect.

74
00:04:47.145 --> 00:04:50.602
You have the right of one box and the left
of the other, they come together and

75
00:04:50.602 --> 00:04:51.697
form the larger space.

76
00:04:51.697 --> 00:04:54.342
Make sense?

77
00:04:54.342 --> 00:04:58.142
Okay, so
you see how you could easily confuse.

78
00:04:58.142 --> 00:05:02.691
Personally, I think space-between and
space-around but

79
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:05.553
space-around, space on two sides.

80
00:05:05.553 --> 00:05:11.054
Space-between, potentially
space on one side, all right?

81
00:05:11.054 --> 00:05:13.821
And then the last one is space-evenly.

82
00:05:19.248 --> 00:05:21.938
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
if we look at space-evenly,

83
00:05:21.938 --> 00:05:25.404
they sort of jerk in
a little bit like that.

84
00:05:25.404 --> 00:05:29.027
Anyone think they know what's
happening here with space-evenly?

85
00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:30.686
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: They're spaced evenly?

86
00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:32.837
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Spaced evenly meaning what?

87
00:05:32.837 --> 00:05:36.097
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The same amount of
space between them and on the sides.

88
00:05:36.097 --> 00:05:40.782
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Same space between,
okay, same between 1 and 2, 2 and 3.

89
00:05:40.782 --> 00:05:45.287
And the same between say 4 in the edge,
1 in the edge, okay?

90
00:05:45.287 --> 00:05:48.871
So the space here between 5 and the edge,
between 5 and 6 and between 6 and

91
00:05:48.871 --> 00:05:51.173
the edge that's all the same space,
all right?

92
00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:52.747
So space-evenly.

93
00:05:52.747 --> 00:05:55.661
This is the newer property, space-evenly.

94
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:58.523
Space-around and space-between
have been around for a while,

95
00:05:58.523 --> 00:06:00.296
space-evenly is a relatively new one.
