00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.083
&gt;&gt; Jen: So let's keep on typing in some
numbers here and you go on ahead and

2
00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.766
figure out the values for d, e, f, and g.

3
00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:10.104
Go on ahead and
type in those values for grid row and

4
00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:12.340
grid column for d, e, f, and g.

5
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.931
Five minutes, go ahead and go.

6
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Quick question before we go.

7
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.496
&gt;&gt; Jen: Sure.

8
00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:23.382
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Justin's asking, for
laying out in rows, do we need to include

9
00:00:23.382 --> 00:00:28.096
the second number or
can we just say grid row 1 and grid row 2?

10
00:00:28.096 --> 00:00:34.232
&gt;&gt; Jen: It depends, so it depends so
you can say simply grid row 1 here for,

11
00:00:34.232 --> 00:00:41.242
say, letter a because we want it to take
up basically one unit here in the row.

12
00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:46.198
But if you're going to have it go multiple
units then you definitely have to

13
00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:48.096
call out the second number.

14
00:00:48.096 --> 00:00:52.595
And, again, because I am interested in
somebody being able to read this code

15
00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:56.628
later, I think it's valuable to go
on ahead and put in both numbers.

16
00:00:56.628 --> 00:00:59.621
So that somebody would be able to
understand that code at a later

17
00:00:59.621 --> 00:01:00.359
point in time.

18
00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:04.339
&gt;&gt; Jen: And it doesn't hurt anything.

19
00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.276
Okay, so five minutes, go on ahead and
take a look at the values for d, e, f, and

20
00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:12.928
g, the grid row and
the grid column values for all of those.

21
00:01:12.928 --> 00:01:14.770
And then we'll go over the answers.
