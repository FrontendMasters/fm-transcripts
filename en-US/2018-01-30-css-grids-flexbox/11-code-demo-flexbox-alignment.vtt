00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you go on ahead and
step number six here.

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.360
What I'm gonna do is set my
justify content to center and

3
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.330
then I'm gonna add
an artificial number here.

4
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.520
Generally speaking, once again,
we don't do this with flex box but for

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.370
demonstration purposes, I'm gonna add
a height to these boxes of 400 pixels.

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.740
Again not something you should do in
real life, don't try this at home, but

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.730
it's helpful for
demonstration purposes, okay?

8
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.980
Just see how this next properties
are going to work, go on ahead and

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.640
set that up.

10
00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.260
And just to show you the impact that
that's had on the page, as you would

11
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.910
expect, our boxes now had a bit of
height and they're centered on the page.

12
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.510
Okay, so once you have that in place,
then here in my notes

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.740
on point number seven, we are going to
take a look at what's called align items.

14
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.710
So align items,
align the items on the cross axis.

15
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.960
So remember our main axis in our
particular example is the row.

16
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.930
Across access is then up and
down vertically.

17
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.730
So these have the different values that
we can align things vertically in space.

18
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.490
Which is why I need to give
this a little bit of height.

19
00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.320
So the values here again are flex start,
flex end, center baseline and stretch.

20
00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.140
Stretch is the default I think,
if I remember correctly.

21
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.520
So let's try some of these other values.

22
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.190
So, this is align items, so,
we'ss go ahead and add that.

23
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:39.085
Align- items and
we'll give this a value of flex-start.

24
00:01:43.234 --> 00:01:46.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, anyone wanna
guess what's gonna happen with this?

25
00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:56.142
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We have any takers on
what's gonna happen with Flex Start?

26
00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:57.827
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Lines at
the top of the access.

27
00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:01.015
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Lines at
the top of the access, okay?

28
00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:04.839
Okay, so Flex Start, what this is doing
is, remember we've set a height on these.

29
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.550
What the flex box property
has done here is it's

30
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.798
preserved that height, so
we have a bit of space between these.

31
00:02:14.798 --> 00:02:21.250
And reduce the size of the box back to
just the height of the content here, okay?

32
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.240
So that's what's going on.

33
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.266
So if we said, and of course
towards the top of the parent here,

34
00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:31.495
if I change this to flex-end,
anyone wanna guess what is gonna happen?

35
00:02:36.234 --> 00:02:39.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If I change it to flex-end,
what's gonna happen?

36
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.300
So right now we have skinny boxes at
the top, what's gonna happen now?

37
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.490
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It's gonna go to the bottom.

38
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Skinny boxes at the bottom,
right?

39
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.237
Okay, so if we save that and

40
00:02:48.237 --> 00:02:52.999
we refresh the page,
skinny box is at the bottom, okay?

41
00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.824
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we said center.

42
00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:05.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here's another thing that
you cannot do any other way, really.

43
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.920
So called holly grail lay out, right?

44
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.410
Centering the horizontally and
vertically space.

45
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.990
So if you set a align items to center and
we take a look at our page.

46
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.030
There they are, okay?

47
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.050
So we have them centred here.

48
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.520
The Distance here on the top, the distance
here on the bottom, everything is very,

49
00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.390
very nicely centered.

50
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.631
Okay, we also have stretch.

51
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what stretch is gonna
do is stretch these to fill up all of

52
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.150
the vertical space.

53
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.327
Stretch to fill all the vertical space.

54
00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:53.126
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then,
we have space between and space around.

55
00:04:02.402 --> 00:04:04.701
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Which, I'm not sure
these are gonna look all that different

56
00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:05.340
here right now.

57
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.686
So, there's space between and
space around.

58
00:04:16.158 --> 00:04:17.321
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so, space between and

59
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:19.960
space around don’t look all
that different in our example.

60
00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.830
But, as you would expect they work
exactly the same kind of way as

61
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.130
we showed vertically.

62
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.830
So, it’s going to assign the space,
if we had a larger

63
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.250
container on the page,
we'd see these move around a little more.

64
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.120
Yes?

65
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.270
&gt;&gt; Kelly: Is align items only
applicable to certain elements?

66
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's
applicable to the children.

67
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.110
&gt;&gt; Kelly: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So the flex items.

68
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.890
&gt;&gt; Kelly: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're putting on the parent

69
00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.930
and that applies to
the distribution of the flex items.

70
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.147
&gt;&gt; Kelly: Okay.

71
00:04:55.147 --> 00:04:55.973
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

72
00:04:57.443 --> 00:04:58.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, and
Mark had a question.

73
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.780
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Kelly is asking,
what if you didn't have a height?

74
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What if
you didn't have a height?

75
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:08.290
You can certainly turn off the height and
we can try space around and

76
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.550
space between that way.

77
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.470
But I think, once again, we're limited.

78
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.200
Probably, what I'd have to do is put a,
well I put the height on the UL,

79
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:26.810
and the LI's are expanding to
occupy that whole space, so sorry.

80
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.920
Probably the best thing to do if you
want to see that in action is to switch

81
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.690
you're main access to be
a column instead of a row.

82
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.390
And then try playing around with the space
around and space between properties.
