00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.925
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,
here's what I did in my CSS.

2
00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:10.304
I went ahead, and in my offsets
document I declared nested once again,

3
00:00:10.304 --> 00:00:14.170
with a grid display of grid
tablet columns of auto.

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.160
Grid gap of 1m.

5
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.300
And then in my media query,
I wanna a heading declared,

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.470
my grid template columns to repeat,
all right?

7
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.860
So three fractions.

8
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.945
And then my grid template areas,

9
00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:33.523
just aside1...aside3.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's

10
00:00:33.523 --> 00:00:37.020
pretty much you all needed to do there,
okay?

11
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.150
And of course, you have to name those.

12
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.950
And you could have put in another
class name those grid areas.

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.220
I use first and last child,
because it was super convenient.

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.540
They are the first and last child,
but you could've created classes for

15
00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.130
those asides, and
then called them something else.

16
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.760
That would've been alright, also.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes?

17
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Since we want these layouts

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.450
to stack on smaller screen sizes anyway,
couldn't we just do a display block and

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.880
then switch to display
grid when we're ready for

20
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.090
the layout to be different?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Absolutely, yes,

21
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.370
you can totally do that.

22
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.236
And in fact,
I did that with the Mandarin painting.

23
00:01:19.236 --> 00:01:22.288
I had it display block at
both the dimensions and

24
00:01:22.288 --> 00:01:25.780
then display grid at mobile and
desktop dimensions.

25
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.640
So yes, that's another
approach that you could take.
