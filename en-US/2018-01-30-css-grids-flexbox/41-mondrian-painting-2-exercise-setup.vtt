00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.212
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's a pretty wild and

2
00:00:01.212 --> 00:00:04.472
wacky layout that we manage to come
up with in an hour, from nothing.

3
00:00:04.472 --> 00:00:09.666
We are gonna move on here to chapter 10,
which is a you-try-it, hooray.

4
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:17.054
So in the you-try-it folder, if you take
a look at the files that I have there.

5
00:00:17.054 --> 00:00:21.200
You will see that I've given you
a different Mondrian painting, okay?

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.640
This one's a little wilder and a little
wackier than the one we just went through.

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.198
I've given you some starting HTML,
here we go,

8
00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.030
I've given you some starting CSS,
all right?

9
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.831
So what you're gonna need to do
in order to put this together,

10
00:00:40.952 --> 00:00:41.754
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me go on ahead and

11
00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:42.798
open this in the browser.

12
00:00:46.508 --> 00:00:49.901
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Helps if I'm in the HTML,
there we go.

13
00:00:52.781 --> 00:00:56.763
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so you've got the
same kind of starting point that you had

14
00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:59.250
with the exercise we just did.

15
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.390
So you're gonna take a similar
kind of approach here.

16
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.398
So number one, and

17
00:01:03.398 --> 00:01:06.990
you can write this down if you need
to remember what the approach is.

18
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.896
So number one, figure out how many
columns and how many rows you have going

19
00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:15.709
on here inside of the painting,
okay, figure that out.

20
00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:20.909
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then number two,
then you're going to go on ahead and

21
00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.968
set this up, set it up as a display
grid on the appropriate element.

22
00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:30.232
And then you can start to lay out
sort of the structure of the page,

23
00:01:30.232 --> 00:01:34.847
so thinking about what is spanning where,
and so forth.

24
00:01:34.847 --> 00:01:35.892
Then number three,

25
00:01:35.892 --> 00:01:39.463
you'll probably need to have a tool
like the Web Developer toolbar.

26
00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:42.376
Again, you can just Google for
it, it'll come right up.

27
00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:46.111
And use one of these pixel-based rulers,
so you can make some measurements.

28
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:49.653
And determine what the sizes are here for
these boxes,

29
00:01:49.653 --> 00:01:52.510
in terms of their widths and
their heights.

30
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.033
And then you should be able to determine
those grid template rows and those grid

31
00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:03.103
template columns with those values,
in order to achieve a layout like this.

32
00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:05.209
Can you image a web page
that looked like this?

33
00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:09.608
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Pretty awesome?

34
00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:12.373
They don't look like Tetris pieces, okay,

35
00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:17.402
you can't quite do a Tetris piece here,
they're still just four-sided boxes.

36
00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:20.618
But it's pretty amazing that we can
achieve a layout like this, all right?
