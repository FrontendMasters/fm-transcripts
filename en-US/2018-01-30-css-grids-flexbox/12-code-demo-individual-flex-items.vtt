1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.605
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

2
00:00:00.605 --> 00:00:03.285
that's pretty much every thing
that can go on with the parent.

3
00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:04.927
So, the flex container.

4
00:00:04.927 --> 00:00:08.613
Now, we're gonna look at
the individual flex items, okay?

5
00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:10.039
Or the LIs.

6
00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.592
And most of the things that
have to do with the LIs.

7
00:00:12.592 --> 00:00:17.390
So what we've seen with the flex
container, the UL in this case,

8
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.070
has to do with distributing
those items in space.

9
00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.079
What order are they gonna go in broadly,
one to six or six to one.

10
00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.169
How are the space gonna be
distributed between those boxes?

11
00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.043
How tall are they gonna be?

12
00:00:30.043 --> 00:00:32.555
That type of thing, right?

13
00:00:32.555 --> 00:00:36.163
Okay, what happens when
we go to our flex items,

14
00:00:36.163 --> 00:00:40.564
it has more to do with ordering and
how wide they are, okay?

15
00:00:40.564 --> 00:00:41.995
Ordering and how wide they are.

16
00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:47.081
And also how they're gonna change
their size over dimensions.

17
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:49.063
That's the other part of it.

18
00:00:49.063 --> 00:00:54.542
Okay, so [COUGH] I'm gonna add
the following class to the flex2.

19
00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:57.694
So just to remind you again, in our HTML,

20
00:00:57.694 --> 00:01:01.476
some of my lis have a class
of flex1 Some of my lis,

21
00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:06.274
notably number three and
number five, have a class of flex2.

22
00:01:06.274 --> 00:01:10.057
What I'm going to do here
is I'm going to take flex2,

23
00:01:10.057 --> 00:01:15.570
I'm gonna give it a border and probably
a little fatter than that on the screen,

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.150
so you can see it a little bit better.

25
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.480
And then I can type in a number and
that's going to reorder these in space.

26
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.615
Actually, I will just copy most of that.

27
00:01:26.615 --> 00:01:29.939
Oops, copy most of that and

28
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.575
I'm gonna drop that here into my CSS.

29
00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:38.118
I'm gonna set this up to be five pixels.

30
00:01:38.118 --> 00:01:39.978
I'll make it dashed instead,

31
00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:43.776
make it a little different than
the dotted thing I had earlier.

32
00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:45.361
And I'm gonna say for my order,

33
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:50.394
I'm gonna give it the number two.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so

34
00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:55.437
order is a number.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It

35
00:01:55.437 --> 00:01:59.081
can be any number you want, all right?

36
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:02.511
And if you go on ahead and save that and

37
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:07.580
then refresh the page.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You'll

38
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.978
see that what we have now is number three
and number five have them pulled out.

39
00:02:12.978 --> 00:02:15.772
The way it's on the screen right now looks
like they're displayed on their own row.

40
00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:19.695
But remember that it sort of
depends on how wide the pages,

41
00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:22.429
now they're not on the same row, okay?

42
00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:27.803
So don't make that assumption.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There

43
00:02:27.803 --> 00:02:29.959
they are not on the same row.

44
00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.521
By default everybody's order
property has a value of one.

45
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.181
So, by saying two, we've pulled them out
of order, and we stick them at the end.

46
00:02:39.181 --> 00:02:43.819
And because I put in on the class, both of
them are on the end in the order that they

47
00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.907
were before, three and then five.

48
00:02:45.907 --> 00:02:51.874
Make sense?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

49
00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:56.810
we're almost done with this and
then you get a quiz.

50
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.182
Okay, so then the next things
we're gonna talk about are what's

51
00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:06.883
called flex basis, flex grow,
and flex shrink, okay?

52
00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:11.754
Flex basis, flex grow, flex shrink and
these are often combined if

53
00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:16.795
you're taking a look at your little
cheat sheet and you take a look down

54
00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:21.512
at the children items down here in
the bottom of your cheat sheet.

55
00:03:21.512 --> 00:03:25.205
You'll see that we are flex grow, flex
shrink, flex basis and then you'll notice

56
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.821
that we have a property called flex, which
is short hand for those three things.

57
00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:30.606
So if you've never seen.

58
00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:32.303
Jenna, I have no idea what
you are talking about.

59
00:03:32.303 --> 00:03:34.170
Flex grow, flex shrink, flex basis.

60
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.988
I've never seen it.

61
00:03:34.988 --> 00:03:38.193
That's because most people don't usually
write it, they usually write just flex.

62
00:03:38.193 --> 00:03:41.312
The word flex and
have these properties associated with it.

63
00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:45.836
So the first one I wanna talk about
though is flex basis because this is

64
00:03:45.836 --> 00:03:49.037
the one that you can kinda
understand by itself.

65
00:03:49.037 --> 00:03:51.054
Grow and shrink get a little weird.

66
00:03:51.054 --> 00:03:56.061
Flex basis is width, is width.

67
00:03:56.061 --> 00:04:00.834
And I put it in quotes because
the actual width property,

68
00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:06.914
width colon some number, you can
think of as an absolute number, okay?

69
00:04:06.914 --> 00:04:11.433
So if your width is 200 pixels,
it's 200 pixels,

70
00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:15.587
no matter where you
are it's always 200 pixels.

71
00:04:15.587 --> 00:04:19.941
But also if your width is 25%, it's always

72
00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:24.864
25% whatever screen you
happen to be looking at.

73
00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:31.993
With flex basis,
you can think of this as sorta 25%, okay?

74
00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:34.482
Because it's flexible.

75
00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.720
So what you basically
say to Flexbox is this.

76
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.344
Hey, Flexbox, please try to get
as close to 25% as possible, but

77
00:04:41.344 --> 00:04:45.410
I know you got a factor in like
there's maybe some margin, or

78
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.627
padding, or
other weirdness going on in here.

79
00:04:48.627 --> 00:04:53.667
So if you don't get to quite 25% and
it's actually more like 27%, or

80
00:04:53.667 --> 00:04:58.948
maybe it's 30%, or whatever it
happens to be, that's okay, all right?

81
00:04:58.948 --> 00:05:03.312
So it's truly a relative sort of number.

82
00:05:03.312 --> 00:05:06.768
So that's how I've explained it here.

83
00:05:06.768 --> 00:05:12.399
And we can go on ahead, and put that in.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: In our style sheet.

84
00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:16.464
So here again on flex2,
is that what I said?

85
00:05:16.464 --> 00:05:19.228
Flex2, yeah, flex2.

86
00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:23.563
We can go ahead and
add a property of flex-basis.

87
00:05:23.563 --> 00:05:27.588
And then that could be followed by
a number, it could be in pixels, but

88
00:05:27.588 --> 00:05:29.992
probably not the best thing in the world.

89
00:05:29.992 --> 00:05:34.056
Probably a better way to do it
is in something like percent or

90
00:05:34.056 --> 00:05:38.200
in the view port units,
view port height, view port width,

91
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.455
that kind of thing,
are probably the better units to choose.

92
00:05:42.455 --> 00:05:44.932
So let's just go in ahead and

93
00:05:44.932 --> 00:05:50.208
say that it's going to be 25%,
since I keep saying that.

94
00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:54.394
[COUGH] And if we refresh our page.

95
00:05:54.394 --> 00:05:58.954
Then you'll see that here's
flex box trying to set these

96
00:05:58.954 --> 00:06:01.240
up to be 25% wide, okay?

97
00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.060
But sometimes the screen is too big.

98
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.148
And actually we're,

99
00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:09.048
you should be looking at just those two
blue ones down there on the bottom, okay?

100
00:06:09.048 --> 00:06:14.845
So because I didn't put on the LIs, so
not all of these items are gonna be 25%.

101
00:06:14.845 --> 00:06:19.618
But if you watch the two blue dotted ones
that are currently at the bottom row,

102
00:06:19.618 --> 00:06:23.227
they should be taking up about
half of the screen, right?

103
00:06:23.227 --> 00:06:24.518
About 50%.

104
00:06:24.518 --> 00:06:28.429
So if you watch they
are kinda close to that,

105
00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:35.608
see how they're kinda close to that?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You

106
00:06:35.608 --> 00:06:41.799
can imagine that they're taking up about
50% but not always, not perfectly, okay?

107
00:06:41.799 --> 00:06:43.978
Make sense?

108
00:06:43.978 --> 00:06:50.090
Okay, so never use the width
property on your flex items,

109
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.204
do not use the width
property on your flex items,

110
00:06:55.204 --> 00:06:59.227
you're gonna use flex basis, okay?

111
00:06:59.227 --> 00:07:00.389
Flex basis.

112
00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:03.459
So when we code our grid
system later on today,

113
00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.019
we're gonna do it with flex
basis as our quote width.

114
00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:12.007
We're never gonna use the width property.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and

115
00:07:12.007 --> 00:07:17.124
then the last two numbers here, and I'm
gonna switch over to just plain old flex,

116
00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:19.661
are the grow and the shrink properties.

117
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:24.687
So if you write this out as flex 0125,
this is a fairly

118
00:07:24.687 --> 00:07:29.730
typical number that you would see for
the flex property.

119
00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.420
The first number is the grow property.

120
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.547
The second number is the shrink property.

121
00:07:34.547 --> 00:07:36.496
And the third number is your flex basis.

122
00:07:36.496 --> 00:07:39.077
So this is how it's written in short hand.

123
00:07:39.077 --> 00:07:44.393
And the grow and the shrink have to
do with how fast a box expands or

124
00:07:44.393 --> 00:07:46.871
how fast it shrinks in space.

125
00:07:46.871 --> 00:07:50.025
So right now all of our
boxes are growing and

126
00:07:50.025 --> 00:07:55.027
shrinking at exactly the same rate
relative to each other, right?

127
00:07:55.027 --> 00:07:59.477
So if we were to say we'd
like these boxes here on

128
00:07:59.477 --> 00:08:03.594
flex2 to grow twice as
fast as other boxes,

129
00:08:03.594 --> 00:08:07.734
let's say that we say a flex2, all right?

130
00:08:07.734 --> 00:08:10.237
So the grow property becomes 2.

131
00:08:10.237 --> 00:08:17.759
Grow these twice as fast.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If we were to do that and

132
00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:23.107
refresh our page,
look at our little boxes here.

133
00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:27.744
See how they sort of jumped really wide?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now they're

134
00:08:27.744 --> 00:08:32.504
giant.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

135
00:08:33.863 --> 00:08:35.491
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that's would grow and

136
00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:36.968
shrink typically do.

137
00:08:36.968 --> 00:08:40.329
Usually, when I'm looking at people's
grid systems built with Flex box,

138
00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:43.385
they aren't really making use of
the grow of the shrink properties.

139
00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:47.569
These tend to be more useful if you're
using Flex box in the appropriate manner.

140
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:49.742
Say, like you have a bunch of
images coming off of your server,

141
00:08:49.742 --> 00:08:51.310
you don’t know how many you’re gonna have.

142
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.503
You wanna display them
on a page in a grid,

143
00:08:53.503 --> 00:08:57.696
okay?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

144
00:08:57.696 --> 00:09:02.571
now that you’re totally numb and you’ve
gone through all of these properties,

145
00:09:02.571 --> 00:09:05.222
do we have any questions
on the properties so

146
00:09:05.222 --> 00:09:09.110
far that we've looked at in
isolation in this exciting screen.
