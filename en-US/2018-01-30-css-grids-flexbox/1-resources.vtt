00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So if you have not done so

2
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.790
yet, you can download all of the files for
the workshop here.

3
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.205
This is www.github.com/jen4web,

4
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:16.266
J-E-N, number 4, W-E-B, /F-E-M,

5
00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.330
as in Frontend Masters, -layout.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.020
And you'll find here
a whole bunch of files.

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.230
In here you will see that there is
a folder called Day one flex box.

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.350
Shockingly, that's where
today's files are.

9
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.210
There's also a folder called Day 2 grid.

10
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.650
Shockingly, that's where
tomorrow's files are.

11
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.450
You'll also see here that we have PDF
files called Day one and Day two.

12
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.380
These are the PowerPoint slides I'm
gonna be speaking from on occasion.

13
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.280
You'll also see here
two additional folders.

14
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.270
One is called Resources.

15
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.750
Resources contains a text file with
lots of additional reading in Flexbox,

16
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.060
in grid, and responsive images
are all covered in there.

17
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.400
We also have a folder
here called branding.

18
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.490
And what branding is,

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.450
is I have an example that I'm gonna
be using throughout this workshop.

20
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.370
It's called The Pie in the Sky Bakery.

21
00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.380
We're gonna talk a lot about pie.

22
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.510
And this is where you
can go to get colors,

23
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.060
logos, pictures of pie,
content about pie and everything

24
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.060
else you might need to build a little
website about the Pie in the Sky Bakery.

25
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.670
So you can help yourself from that.

26
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.670
Inside of the Day one folder, for example,
you will find a series of chapters.

27
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.670
These chapters are numbered
one through seven.

28
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.540
And I'll tell you which folder we're
working in at any particular point

29
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.646
in time.

30
00:01:33.646 --> 00:01:37.720
Most of these folders, though not
all of them, are divided as follows.

31
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.190
There's a begin state and an end state.

32
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.250
The begin state is the files
we're gonna start with.

33
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.080
And we'll start working with those files.

34
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.830
We're gonna add code to them.

35
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.020
By the end, they will look like
the files that are in the end folder.

36
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.010
If you get lost anywhere along the way,

37
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.500
feel free to take a look
at the end folder.

38
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.400
And as always in HTML and CSS,

39
00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.500
there is more than one answer
to everything that we do.

40
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.780
So just because I have one answer,

41
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.690
your answer may be completely different,
but absolutely as legitimate as my answer.

42
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.310
So please don't take mine as the gospel,
it's not.

43
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.330
And then finally, there's also a file
in here that's called instructions.

44
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.138
If you are following along with this
video after the course is over, and

45
00:02:19.138 --> 00:02:22.310
you are interested in finding out what

46
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.750
we did with this particular folder of
information, this is an outline describing

47
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.440
what you were doing with those particular
files somewhere along the way.
