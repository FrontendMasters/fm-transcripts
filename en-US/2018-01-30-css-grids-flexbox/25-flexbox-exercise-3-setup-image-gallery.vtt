00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.264
&gt;&gt; Jen Kenner: The next thing we're
gonna move on to is how to use Flexbox

2
00:00:03.264 --> 00:00:05.445
correctly, so now that we hacked it.

3
00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:08.199
We're going to go on to our image gallery,
and

4
00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.602
I'm actually gonna let you
guys run this one on your own.

5
00:00:11.602 --> 00:00:15.842
So,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kenner: I'm gonna go ahead and

6
00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:18.229
open this page in the web browser.

7
00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:21.142
So once again, we have a prototype here.

8
00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:27.400
So this is a whole series of
pictures of pies and captions.

9
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.060
Isn't that lovely?

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.264
And the pies go on forever.

11
00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.590
I think there is something
like 17 of these.

12
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.400
I've marked these up for you.

13
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.010
So the markup that I did is the following.

14
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.860
So it's just a bunch of pictures,
so that's an unordered list.

15
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.510
Within each of the list items, it's a
figure, because we have both an image and

16
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.623
a caption to go with it.

17
00:00:48.623 --> 00:00:49.815
So there is our image and

18
00:00:49.815 --> 00:00:53.800
then we have a figure caption that's
displaying along with that image.

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.740
So this is something that you
might get from a web server.

20
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.510
I’ve mentioned this a few times.

21
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.860
You might have some number of images
coming in for an image gallery, or

22
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.620
some number of little
blurby kind of things.

23
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.570
Coming in for press releases, or articles,
blog posts, whatever it happens to be.

24
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.460
Coming in from your database and you need
to display them here on the web page.

25
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.969
So here’s a whole bunch of these.

26
00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:24.016
So the goal of this now is I'd like
you to display this, and I'm gonna

27
00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:30.965
show you the end state that I have here.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kenner: So

28
00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:34.510
I want you to display this in
some way that makes sense to you.

29
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.797
This is one possibility where we
have a whole bunch of pictures, and

30
00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:42.183
notice how they just sort of
shift around on the page,

31
00:01:42.183 --> 00:01:44.681
depending on our width, and so forth.

32
00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:48.730
This is the way Flexbox is
supposed to work, okay?

33
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.610
And it's kinda cool that
they're all different sizes,

34
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.540
I think,
I really like this particular effect.

35
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.497
If you don't like that effect,

36
00:01:55.497 --> 00:02:00.180
there's a second possible answer to this,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kenner: And

37
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.294
I'll show you that as well.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kenner: Which is

38
00:02:05.294 --> 00:02:11.440
we can fix this down to let's say
three images per row, like this, okay?

39
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.690
And, whoops, and we can do three
images per row, and then we can go to,

40
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.630
whatever, two images a row, and
then one image a row, okay?

41
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.660
So that's your hint,

42
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.420
that's what we're looking for, and you
know enough about Flexbox at this point.

43
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.580
That what I'd like for
you to do is to go ahead and

44
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.201
write one possible solution that's going
to lay out these pictures on the webpage.

45
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:44.308
It's obviously gonna loop or
loop these images over and over again, so

46
00:02:44.308 --> 00:02:47.450
there's no grid structure to this, okay?

47
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.808
And there's not a whole
lot of CSS required.
