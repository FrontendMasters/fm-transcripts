1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So we are gonna be working
with some paintings by Piet Mondrian.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.243
And you may not be familiar with him.

3
00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:07.079
He's a Dutch painter.

4
00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:09.570
He painted these paintings
around the 1930s.

5
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.420
And in the background of these women
here is an example of his painting.

6
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.322
If you can imagine,
those are red, yellow and

7
00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:20.128
blue blocks along with white
blocks with the black borders.

8
00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:22.738
You've probably seen these
patterns somewhere out there.

9
00:00:22.738 --> 00:00:27.318
And then, this is Yves Saint Laurent,
the dress designer in the 60s,

10
00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:30.410
decided to make dresses
based on the paintings.

11
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.280
I just love this picture.

12
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.322
So [LAUGH],
we're gonna actually go ahead and

13
00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:40.618
recreate some of Mondrian's paintings
using CSS grid, cuz why not, right?

14
00:00:40.618 --> 00:00:43.297
Okay, so
I'm gonna do one of these with you and

15
00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:45.994
then you're gonna do one
of these on your own.

16
00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:50.953
So going ahead and open up in chapter

17
00:00:50.953 --> 00:00:56.346
nine,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Chapter nine and

18
00:00:56.346 --> 00:00:59.445
going ahead and open up the begin folder.

19
00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:05.088
We're gonna open up index.html and
painting.css.

20
00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:08.037
The painting is just in the wrong place.

21
00:01:08.037 --> 00:01:12.417
So, I think the painting is outside
of the beginning and end folder, so

22
00:01:12.417 --> 00:01:16.517
you probably wanna either fix the path or
drag it into that folder.

23
00:01:22.357 --> 00:01:25.062
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flexbox, sorry.

24
00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:29.318
Okay grid, and
we'll go to the mondrian-painting,

25
00:01:29.318 --> 00:01:33.677
and we'll go to put the painting
into the begin folder.

26
00:01:38.496 --> 00:01:42.618
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then if you were
to open the HTML here into a browser,

27
00:01:42.618 --> 00:01:45.705
once you've moved that painting image.

28
00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:47.947
So people in the internet apologize or

29
00:01:47.947 --> 00:01:51.245
put the painting picture in
the wrong place for the URL.

30
00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:55.518
Just go ahead and move it into the begin
folder and that will get you started.

31
00:01:55.518 --> 00:02:02.092
So what we've got going on here is,
we have Mondrian's painting here.

32
00:02:02.092 --> 00:02:07.442
And I have gone ahead and labeled
each of these squares with a letter,

33
00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:11.972
okay, so that you have a sense
of what we're trying to do.

34
00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:14.384
And you'll see that in our HTML,

35
00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:19.744
those letters correspond to these divs,
also with letters, all right?

36
00:02:19.744 --> 00:02:26.353
So what we're gonna do is, we are gonna
try to match these two things together.

37
00:02:26.353 --> 00:02:31.426
So I've given you a starting wrapper,
600 by 600 pixels,

38
00:02:31.426 --> 00:02:36.698
I've given you the background image
here and the divs are in place.

39
00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:40.386
I've outlined them in blacks so
that they show up a little bit better and

40
00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:42.177
given them a little bit of a pasty.

41
00:02:42.177 --> 00:02:46.401
So we have a background image with this
divs on top of it, they're real picks so

42
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:49.089
we can kind of see the painting
behind the divs, so

43
00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:51.397
we can work on lining things up correctly.

44
00:02:51.397 --> 00:02:52.686
Makes sense?

45
00:02:52.686 --> 00:02:56.296
Okay, so here is the next thing
that I'd like for you to do.

46
00:02:58.456 --> 00:03:04.315
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna start with, very simply,

47
00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:09.334
let's just get these boxes
sort of in the right shapes.

48
00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:16.162
And what I mean by that is, if we look
at just a, b and c here in the painting.

49
00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:17.962
Let's see if we can get a and

50
00:03:17.962 --> 00:03:21.734
b stacked on top of each other
with a big box of c next to it.

51
00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:24.695
Don't worry about the proportions
at this point, okay.

52
00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:29.880
Don't worry about the a's being skinny and
the c being fatter.

53
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.820
Let's just get two boxes stacked on top
of each other next to a larger box.

54
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.830
All right, make sense?

55
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.100
We're gonna code this together.

56
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.460
So what do I need to do to get
started here with this painting?

57
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.250
What is the first thing
that I should type in?

58
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:48.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Display grid.

59
00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.470
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display grid,
and where is that gonna go?

60
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.700
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The wrapper.

61
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.294
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: On the wrapper, exactly.

62
00:03:56.756 --> 00:03:59.438
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display grid,
always a good start.

63
00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:06.288
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And if you wanna have
a grid-gap, just sort of as a placeholder,

64
00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:09.562
you can go ahead and
do that for now, grid-gap.

65
00:04:09.562 --> 00:04:12.465
And just set it up for 10 pixels.

66
00:04:12.465 --> 00:04:16.029
That's not the right number ultimately,
but just as a placeholder.

67
00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:20.186
Just go on ahead and
put that in place, okay.

68
00:04:20.186 --> 00:04:24.792
So looking at this painting again,
a, b, and c,

69
00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:29.620
what are the numbers that
I'm gonna need to put in for

70
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.460
grid rows and grid columns for a, b and c?

71
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.710
So I'm gonna let you think about that for
just a moment.

72
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.061
And I'm gonna give you the hint that
the values here are gonna be grid-row and

73
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:46.370
grid-column.

74
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.409
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're gonna need
those values for a, b and c.

75
00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:57.283
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And for
all the other ones for that matter.

76
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: But now, we need to
think about what the numbers are.

77
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.404
So what is the best way to start
with that, if we look at this?

78
00:05:09.404 --> 00:05:13.526
How many overall columns and
rows do we have in this painting?

79
00:05:16.835 --> 00:05:18.472
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Does it count three?

80
00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:22.222
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The black areas here
are gonna wind up being the grid gap, so

81
00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:23.506
don't count them.

82
00:05:23.506 --> 00:05:25.689
What do you think?

83
00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.834
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Is it three rows and
three columns?

84
00:05:28.834 --> 00:05:31.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Three rows and
three columns.

85
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.680
So we have one row here, that's a, okay?

86
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.442
We have one row here, that's b.

87
00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:43.457
We have a row here, it looks like a d but
then, what happens over here on the side?

88
00:05:43.457 --> 00:05:45.513
f and g, right?

89
00:05:45.513 --> 00:05:46.836
So it's split.

90
00:05:46.836 --> 00:05:50.517
So this is actually like four rows, right?

91
00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.956
Four rows, okay?

92
00:05:51.956 --> 00:05:53.709
How many columns do we have?

93
00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:55.126
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Three.

94
00:05:55.126 --> 00:05:56.786
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Three, right?

95
00:05:56.786 --> 00:06:01.401
So a b, d is one column, sort of c and
e is the second column, and f,

96
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:05.950
g with the c at the top of it that's
the third column, make sense?

97
00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:11.200
Okay, so filing that way,
what would our numbers

98
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.086
be then to specify where
a is here in this grid?

99
00:06:16.086 --> 00:06:20.178
What are the numbers that I would type
in for the grid row and grid column for

100
00:06:20.178 --> 00:06:20.776
letter a?

101
00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:30.360
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: The 1/4 for the row,
and then 1/3 for the column?

102
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
you're saying 1/4 for

103
00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:40.710
the row and 1/3 for the column, okay?

104
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.710
So where are you getting that from?

105
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.860
So for the row, 1/4?

106
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.206
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: I was just thinking we were
starting the upper left hand corner, so

107
00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:53.400
it would be in the first column,
and also in the first row.

108
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.764
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: We already know

109
00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:57.343
how many rows and columns we have,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Right.

110
00:06:57.343 --> 00:06:59.154
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: So that's where it is.

111
00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:03.925
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so a is actually
gonna go from one, which is right here

112
00:07:03.925 --> 00:07:09.185
just over the top of a, right,
to two which is here between a and b.

113
00:07:09.185 --> 00:07:12.993
Three is gonna be here between b and d,

114
00:07:12.993 --> 00:07:17.277
and four will be here after d, make sense?

115
00:07:17.277 --> 00:07:21.387
And then with the columns,
one is over here on the side,

116
00:07:21.387 --> 00:07:25.190
two winds up being here between b and c.

117
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.861
Three winds up here between e and
the f, g pair.

118
00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:31.530
And then,
four is over here on the outside.

119
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.830
Make sense?

120
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.960
Okay, so what would our numbers be
then for letter a, for the column?

121
00:07:40.177 --> 00:07:40.978
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One to two.

122
00:07:40.978 --> 00:07:42.511
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One slash two, right?

123
00:07:42.511 --> 00:07:47.640
1/2 and then for the grid column,

124
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.125
what would be here for a?

125
00:07:54.005 --> 00:07:55.433
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Same.

126
00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:56.688
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The same, right?

127
00:07:56.688 --> 00:08:01.192
So 1/2, and 1/2, okay.

128
00:08:01.192 --> 00:08:02.493
How about letter b?

129
00:08:05.801 --> 00:08:07.346
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Do the same column.

130
00:08:07.346 --> 00:08:08.820
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So same column, right?

131
00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.468
So it's still 1/2.

132
00:08:15.809 --> 00:08:19.884
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
but what about the row?

133
00:08:19.884 --> 00:08:21.823
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: 2/3?

134
00:08:21.823 --> 00:08:23.227
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2/3, right?

135
00:08:23.227 --> 00:08:25.888
So 2 to 3, okay?

136
00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:26.827
2/3.

137
00:08:31.646 --> 00:08:33.783
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, good.

138
00:08:33.783 --> 00:08:35.443
All right, now how about letter c?

139
00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:42.653
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What
about its column value?

140
00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.760
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: Justin in chat saying 2/4.

141
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.816
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 2/4, good job Justin.

142
00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:53.148
So 2 to 3, 3 to 4.

143
00:08:53.148 --> 00:08:55.945
So 2/4 would be the column value.

144
00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:02.355
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Oops, 2/4.

145
00:09:02.355 --> 00:09:05.037
And the row for c?

146
00:09:05.037 --> 00:09:08.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: 1 to 3, 1/3.

147
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.743
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So from 1 to 2,
2 to 3, right, so 1/3 for the row.

148
00:09:18.342 --> 00:09:21.613
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, [COUGH] so
if we just go on ahead and

149
00:09:21.613 --> 00:09:25.390
take a look at our layout so
far, we get this.

150
00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:29.827
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Who's a little weirded out?

151
00:09:34.364 --> 00:09:36.129
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Nobody a little
weirded out by that result?

152
00:09:39.763 --> 00:09:42.579
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anyone have any
idea what's going on here?

153
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.820
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: I just have a question.

154
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.882
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Why is c for the grid row,

155
00:09:47.882 --> 00:09:52.115
why isn't it 2/3 for the grid row?

156
00:09:52.115 --> 00:09:52.915
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: For the grid row?

157
00:09:52.915 --> 00:09:53.648
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Yeah.

158
00:09:53.648 --> 00:09:56.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because it start here one.

159
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.351
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.

160
00:09:57.351 --> 00:10:00.967
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It goes to two,
two will be somewhere here, right?

161
00:10:00.967 --> 00:10:01.734
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay.

162
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.582
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then from here, 2 to 3.

163
00:10:03.582 --> 00:10:04.720
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Okay, all right.

164
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.415
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

165
00:10:05.415 --> 00:10:06.241
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Thank you.

166
00:10:06.241 --> 00:10:11.499
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool yep, okay so,
here's what's going on here with grid.

167
00:10:11.499 --> 00:10:16.828
Grid is very, very smart and it tries to
anticipate what you're trying to do, okay?

168
00:10:16.828 --> 00:10:21.605
So grid knows based on the numbers
that you've typed in that

169
00:10:21.605 --> 00:10:25.722
there are three columns in existence here,
okay?

170
00:10:25.722 --> 00:10:28.729
So it knows that,
this is called the implicit grid.

171
00:10:28.729 --> 00:10:35.590
So it is very helpfully constructed
three columns on this, all right?

172
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.506
It knows that there are at
least two rows in existence

173
00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:44.650
because we have a and
b in those rows, okay?

174
00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.633
But grid also knows that we have boxes d,
e,

175
00:10:47.633 --> 00:10:52.245
f and g, and we haven't said where
those are going to be placed yet.

176
00:10:52.245 --> 00:10:54.830
So grid is going to be very smart and

177
00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:59.838
say, you must want three columns and
you want some more rows.

178
00:10:59.838 --> 00:11:04.134
And I'm just gonna make more rows
that are three columns each and

179
00:11:04.134 --> 00:11:09.970
put something in each one of those
columns until I run out of stuff, okay?

180
00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:11.930
So that's called the implicit grid.

181
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:17.280
By implying what we're looking for
with our first three values here,

182
00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.460
grid is continuing to construct the layout
going down the page, all right?

183
00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.590
So that's where those things
are gonna be by default.

184
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:28.260
That's probably not where we want them.

185
00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:34.050
We're going to need to get more explicit
about where we want d, e and f to go.

186
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:34.620
Make sense?

187
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.600
Okay, and for those of you who
are bothered by the fact that a, b and

188
00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.430
c don't line up perfectly,
that's totally okay.

189
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:45.391
The shape is good.

190
00:11:45.391 --> 00:11:49.988
We're gonna get to exactly how those
are gonna line up perfectly, momentarily.
