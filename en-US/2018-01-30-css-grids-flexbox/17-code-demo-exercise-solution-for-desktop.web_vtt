00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.440
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We are gonna go ahead and
do this together.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.430
If you go into chapter three,
the flex box grid set of files, and

3
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.110
go into the begin folder.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.520
Go ahead and open up Flexbox.html and
Flexbox.css.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.200
Those are gonna be the files
that we're working with.

6
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.060
And just to get us started,
I'll go ahead and

7
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.670
open up the page currently in the browser.

8
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.880
So it looks pretty much
the way you might expect.

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.680
It's the same pies that you saw before,

10
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.870
stacked one on top of the other,
all right.

11
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:36.560
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool.

12
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.260
So we wanna go ahead and
start this off in our grid system.

13
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.291
So let's just start here with the HTML,
what would people recommend as

14
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:55.530
a first move to make in this HTML
to set this up as a grid system?

15
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.627
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Something that's
really obvious we can do immediately.

16
00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:01.600
&gt;&gt; Student: Add the row class?

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.600
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's add the row class,
right, So we have all these divs here,

18
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.660
add to that a class of row.

19
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.326
So let's go ahead and set those up.

20
00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:18.001
So div with a class of row,
another div with a class of row,

21
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:22.279
another div with a class of row, and
another div with a class of row.

22
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.630
Okay, so let's write
a corresponding style for that.

23
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.280
So in our Flexbox.css,
this is pretty much what we had before for

24
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.180
the floats,
at least at our starting point.

25
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.320
We have our border box model in place.

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.460
We have some sort of basic styling for
the page.

27
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.109
And then down here is our grid system and
our media queries.

28
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.590
So does anybody have suggestion for
how we can start the row class?

29
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.390
And where am I going to
place it on the stylesheet?

30
00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:02.210
&gt;&gt; Student2: Let's put it right
where your grid system starts maybe.

31
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
we're gonna put the row class right here.

32
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.000
So in other words, in the mobile section,
outside of a media query,

33
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.710
we wanna put the row class, okay.

34
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.440
And that is reasonable, right?

35
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.940
Because we're gonna be using
flexbox on all of these dimensions.

36
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.660
You have to have a parent and the child.

37
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.640
The flexbox container of the flex items.

38
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.200
So this needs to be
outside of the container.

39
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.930
What are the kinds of property-value
pairs I'm gonna enter here for my row?

40
00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:34.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What is one of the first
things that I need to put in place?

41
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.840
Yes.

42
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.680
&gt;&gt; Student2: Display flex.

43
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.822
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display flex
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Awesome.

44
00:02:41.822 --> 00:02:45.260
Okay, without that we have no flexbox,
right.

45
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.950
So we gotta have that.
What would be the next thing that would

46
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.410
follow on after that.

47
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.743
Pull out your cheat sheets here,
refer to them so

48
00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:56.380
you can remember what the properties are.

49
00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.859
What is the next thing we should put in,

50
00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.000
now that we've got our
display flex in place?

51
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.160
&gt;&gt; Student: Flex direction.

52
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so
a flex direction and a flex wrap.

53
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.296
Or alternatively we could
just do a flex flow,

54
00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:17.000
which I'm gonna do,
a flex flow of row and wrap, okay.

55
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.110
It's a webpage grid system,
we pretty much build these based on rows.

56
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.150
So this is probably
the values that you want.

57
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:32.530
Let's start with row number 1, here,
and let’s work on it for the desktop.

58
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.027
So row number 1,

59
00:03:36.027 --> 00:03:41.510
we wanna put four boxes all next to each
other here at the desktop dimensions.

60
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.640
So four kinds of pie
all next to each other.

61
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.290
How would we go about writing?

62
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.270
First of all,
what should we call this class?

63
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.610
How are we going to apply
it here in our HTML?

64
00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.040
And then let's write some CSS for it.

65
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.730
So if we call this class, what?

66
00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.278
What would be a good name for this?

67
00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.955
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Should
we just call it col 1?

68
00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:06.744
Col 1, col-1.

69
00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:11.871
And we're gonna go ahead and
put that col-1 for

70
00:04:11.871 --> 00:04:15.410
these first four articles.

71
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:22.430
So line 14, line 20,
line 26, and line 32, okay?

72
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.650
So there's our four boxes here.

73
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.428
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then let's go ahead and write a style for

74
00:04:33.428 --> 00:04:35.430
this at the desktop dimension.

75
00:04:42.753 --> 00:04:44.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] So
what would the style look like?

76
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.986
It's gonna be col-1, and

77
00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:52.280
what would be the properties that
would be associated with this?

78
00:04:56.016 --> 00:04:59.170
&gt;&gt; Student: Flex-basis.

79
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.140
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So maybe a flex-basis
would be a good thing to have, okay.

80
00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.503
So if we said flex grow, shrink,
and then we need a number for

81
00:05:07.503 --> 00:05:09.484
the flex-basis, right.

82
00:05:09.484 --> 00:05:12.300
So what would be a reasonable number for
that?

83
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.440
&gt;&gt; Student2: Should we keep the same
ones that we were using before?

84
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.550
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure,
that layout worked with the floats, so

85
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.577
what might be a reasonable number
here to add for the basis?

86
00:05:23.577 --> 00:05:24.671
&gt;&gt; Student2: 20%?

87
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:30.150
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 20%, okay.

88
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.740
So instead of calling it width of 20%,

89
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.080
we're gonna call it a flex-basis of 20%,
okay?

90
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.330
So if we were to look at that in our
browser right now, how would it look?

91
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.370
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There's row 1.

92
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.200
Is that what you want?

93
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.517
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Are you happy?

94
00:05:55.517 --> 00:05:56.980
Any designers in the room?

95
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.820
&gt;&gt; Student2: We could use more margins.

96
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.525
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Probably use a little
margin in there, couldn't we?

97
00:06:03.525 --> 00:06:07.450
Okay, so one thing we could do would be,

98
00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.310
I'm gonna put this outside
the media query here.

99
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:17.455
And we can use our fancy attribute

100
00:06:17.455 --> 00:06:21.323
selector, class*=,

101
00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:31.310
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: col-1, all right?

102
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.240
Sorry, col, not a hyphen one,
cuz we're gonna have other ones.

103
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.230
And we could say that the margin would be,

104
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.400
let's say 0 on the top and bottom,
and 4% on the left and right.

105
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.412
So that would match what we
had before with the floats.

106
00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:51.240
We put the 4% only on the left,
here we can sort of do it this way.

107
00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:59.795
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

108
00:06:59.795 --> 00:07:04.379
if we did that,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's see what that

109
00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:05.030
looks like.

110
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:10.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, I probably put
a little bit too much margin on that.

111
00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:17.270
So maybe here in my col-1,

112
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.580
maybe I want that margin only
to be on the left or something.

113
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:26.701
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let's
say that's margin-left,

114
00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:31.131
4%
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and

115
00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:35.750
now when we refresh,
it'll all go on one line.

116
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.250
There we go.

117
00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:41.930
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And if you want
the fancy color, we can add that too.

118
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:47.114
I'll just go ahead and put that here,

119
00:07:47.114 --> 00:07:52.623
col-1, background-color, fffc.

120
00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.508
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

121
00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:05.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right.

122
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:06.950
So let me show you the code.

123
00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.870
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And I'll give you just
a second here to catch up with what I did.

124
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:18.150
[COUGH]
So once again, we have our row on line 34.

125
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:21.190
We have a display of flex,
flex flow over our wrap.

126
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:27.280
So that's setting up our
entire sort of flex system.

127
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.750
We have a left margin of 4% on all column
classes, with one existing so far.

128
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:39.500
And then we're putting in our individual
sizes using flex-basis on the desktop.

129
00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.961
Okay, so how about row 2?

130
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:46.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What are we
gonna call these boxes?

131
00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.473
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We add article class
to these and call them col-2,

132
00:08:52.473 --> 00:08:54.960
cuz we're super creative people.

133
00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:02.415
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

134
00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.491
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
now that we've got that,

135
00:09:06.491 --> 00:09:09.310
what should we do here with
our grid system this time?

136
00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.371
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
we just created a class of col-2.

137
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.300
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What did we
want col-2 to look like?

138
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.592
&gt;&gt; Student2: Twice as big as col-1?

139
00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:30.200
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Twice as big as col-1,
right?

140
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:36.140
We want two columns,
each of which is two columns wide.

141
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:42.034
So our class for this,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: col-2,

142
00:09:42.034 --> 00:09:45.655
what are we gonna put in here this time?

143
00:09:45.655 --> 00:09:46.279
&gt;&gt; Student2: Flex.

144
00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:54.840
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex: 0 0
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody know?

145
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:58.240
If you take a look at your float code,
you might have some hints in there.

146
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.069
&gt;&gt; Student2: Is it 44?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, how about 44%.

147
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:06.693
Do you guys know how I get these numbers?

148
00:10:06.693 --> 00:10:09.580
&gt;&gt; Student: It's out of 97.

149
00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me put back
up the PowerPoint slide here

150
00:10:15.048 --> 00:10:16.887
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: This handy,

151
00:10:16.887 --> 00:10:19.500
handy item here.

152
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:25.165
Okay, so if we've got 4%, right,
on the left, right, 4, 8, 12, 16.

153
00:10:25.165 --> 00:10:32.390
We don’t specially call out 4% here,
but it works out to be that, right?

154
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:36.170
That’s sort of the leftover margin,
because each of these is 20%, right?

155
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:41.640
2, 4, 6, 8, add to that to the 16
of margin, we have 96% total.

156
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.840
So the remaining 4% winds up
over here on the right, right?

157
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.390
So far, so good.

158
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.735
If we wanna go to two, two of two, right,

159
00:10:50.735 --> 00:10:55.720
then we're going to take our
20% plus our 20% and what?

160
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.740
&gt;&gt; Student2: The margin between them?

161
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.784
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The previous
margin that was between them,

162
00:11:02.784 --> 00:11:07.490
which was 4%, and that becomes 44%, right?

163
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.840
Okay, so what's the number for three wide?

164
00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.030
Somebody do the math here, and
figure out what three wide is?

165
00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:20.955
&gt;&gt; Student2: 68.

166
00:11:20.955 --> 00:11:24.215
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 68, correct.

167
00:11:24.215 --> 00:11:29.465
So 2, 4, 6, plus the 4,

168
00:11:29.465 --> 00:11:33.050
8, right, 68.

169
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:37.670
And then the total width, if I said it's
totally going to take up the full width,

170
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:40.640
but of course I still want the margin so
it all lines up and looks pretty,

171
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.687
what would that full-width number be?

172
00:11:43.687 --> 00:11:45.225
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Student2: 92.

173
00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:49.460
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, Peter's the one
who's doing the math in here.

174
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.840
So 2, 4, 6, 8, okay,
80%, plus the 4, 8, 12.

175
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.660
So 80 plus 12, 92.

176
00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:00.673
Or you could just say 100 minus 8%,

177
00:12:00.673 --> 00:12:04.220
right, 4 and 4 over here.

178
00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:10.830
Does that help,
where those numbers come from?

179
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:14.260
Okay, so let's go on ahead and add these.

180
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.340
Then we can just assume that
we're gonna have a col-3.

181
00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.945
And we assume that we're
gonna have a col-4.

182
00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:32.294
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And go on ahead and
drop in those flex values then for

183
00:12:32.294 --> 00:12:34.470
those properties.

184
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:52.050
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

185
00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:00.572
&gt;&gt; Student2: Well,
I'm not sure the context exactly matches,

186
00:13:00.572 --> 00:13:05.352
but why not use
justify-contents space-around

187
00:13:05.352 --> 00:13:09.349
in the row in order to
give us the margins?

188
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:11.880
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Use a my content space?

189
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:14.690
&gt;&gt; Student2: Justify-content space-around.

190
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.795
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Why not just use
justify-content for these rows?

191
00:13:17.795 --> 00:13:23.284
Because we're working with flexbox,
so in order to get a grid

192
00:13:23.284 --> 00:13:28.352
system that works,
that's sort of locked into place and

193
00:13:28.352 --> 00:13:33.528
is reliably displaying across
different screen sizes and

194
00:13:33.528 --> 00:13:40.520
doesn't do weird things, the margins
here are more rigid and less flexible.

195
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.840
So basically what we've done here
is we've broken, believe it or not,

196
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.060
we've broken all of those justify-content
properties in favor of working

197
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:54.020
with margin here, because now I can
specifically say I always want 4%.

198
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.730
Otherwise what's gonna happen is,
you'll wind up with several rows.

199
00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.564
And then, depending on what content you
have inside of that, your boxes may or

200
00:14:02.564 --> 00:14:04.710
may not line up exactly so.

201
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.960
And so you'll wind up with
stuff all over the page, and

202
00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.385
the designers will have a fit, right.

203
00:14:09.385 --> 00:14:12.110
So we're using margin,

204
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:17.650
which is very firm in the context
of this grid system, okay.

205
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.344
We'll come back to things
like justify-content and so

206
00:14:21.344 --> 00:14:24.730
forth when we get into flexbox
the right way [LAUGH].

207
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:30.360
Okay, everybody else doing all right so
far?

208
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.760
&gt;&gt; Student2: Yeah, similar question
around where we were border boxing,

209
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:40.359
why not just set it to 50% and set padding
and do away with the pesky margins?

210
00:14:40.359 --> 00:14:41.728
But like you said,

211
00:14:41.728 --> 00:14:44.858
we're taking control here and-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Exactly, yeah.

212
00:14:44.858 --> 00:14:48.278
Some people prefer to work
with that padding model, and

213
00:14:48.278 --> 00:14:52.492
if you wanted to do that,
you could go ahead and give it a try.

214
00:14:52.492 --> 00:14:55.550
Most of the grid systems,
if you take a look at them,

215
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.220
most of them are doing it this way.

216
00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.010
They're working with the margin
instead of working with the padding.

217
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.820
So I would say experiment and see what
works best for your particular situation.

218
00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:08.312
That would be our desktop CSS.

219
00:15:08.312 --> 00:15:11.350
Let's go ahead and apply it in our HTML.

220
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.780
So we have our call tos are in place.

221
00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:19.140
And then in the first row 4,
I apologize for that,

222
00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.970
a little typo there, it should be row 3,
line 55 should be row 3,

223
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:28.130
we'll go on ahead and
set our first article here

224
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:38.035
to a class of col-1, and
our second article to a class of col-3.

225
00:15:38.035 --> 00:15:42.462
And then in our last column,

226
00:15:42.462 --> 00:15:50.031
we can set our article
here to a class of col-4.

227
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.210
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] Which is exactly
the same HTML that we had with our floats,

228
00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:58.850
by the way.

229
00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:04.200
Except for the tweak that we're gonna
wind up having to make with those one

230
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.300
column wide boxes we'll
come to in just a second.

231
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.926
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and
then on the CSS side of this,

232
00:16:11.926 --> 00:16:15.310
if you wanna add more
of the fabulous colors,

233
00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: For column 2, 3, and 4,

234
00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:28.724
I find these helpful because then
it helps me identify visually

235
00:16:28.724 --> 00:16:34.020
at least where these started and
what their classes are.

236
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.761
And so we'll go ahead and set these up.

237
00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:41.790
col-2 would be ccf,

238
00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:46.819
col-3 would be fcf,

239
00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:52.650
and col-4 would be cff.

240
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.750
All web safe, actually, if those
things still exist, which they don't.

241
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:02.953
All right, and if you go on ahead and
save all of that and take a look at this

242
00:17:02.953 --> 00:17:07.664
at a desktop dimension,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You

243
00:17:07.664 --> 00:17:12.320
should wind up with something that
looks kinda shockingly familiar, right?

244
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:15.488
So we've got four, we've got our two and
two, our one and three, and

245
00:17:15.488 --> 00:17:17.014
our four down here at the bottom.
