00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.090
&gt;&gt; Jen: How did the rest of you do?

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.380
What tripped you up along the way?

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.490
Anything in particular?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: For me it was hard to

4
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.460
get rid of everything and
then put it back together and think about.

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.340
It would be easy maybe
starting from the ground up.

6
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.150
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah, definitely,

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.700
definitely.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But

8
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.660
it was hard to pull it out and

9
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.470
push it back in.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah, yeah,

10
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.700
it's always hard rewriting code,
especially when it's not your own.

11
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.707
But unfortunately, it's something we
get called on to do a lot, don't we?

12
00:00:25.707 --> 00:00:30.400
[LAUGH] Please fix this code
that somebody else wrote.

13
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.328
So I hear you on that.

14
00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:40.710
[COUGH] All right, so we'll go ahead and
put up our answer here.

15
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.699
So somebody pointed out
over the break that I have

16
00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.211
been neglectful of my meta viewport tags.

17
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.783
And I went back through the files for
the last two days and

18
00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:54.430
realized there are a whole lot of files
that are missing the meta viewport tag.

19
00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.621
So if that bothers you, I have added
that back to the master files and

20
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:05.546
I have put those up on GitHub for you.

21
00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:08.899
And in fact, let me get out
of that folder all together,

22
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.190
&gt;&gt; Jen: So I don't write over my original.

23
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.300
Okay, so the answers here then
to the high in the sky history.

24
00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.630
I wound up doing a few things here.

25
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.890
The thing that really threw me as I was
working through this particular page

26
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.660
actually was the nav bar.

27
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.350
The rest of it I found fairly
straightforward to recode.

28
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.340
But the nav bar has that cute little
scallop on the top that looks like pie

29
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.960
crust, and

30
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.880
I had a really hard time getting it
to work with the HTML that I had.

31
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.390
So I wound up adding a div
that's basically an empty div,

32
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.370
it just has the background image in it.

33
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.400
So that sits right on top of the nav bar,

34
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.800
I'll show you the CSS in a moment, and
holds as a container for the pie crust.

35
00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.460
I didn't have to do that with
the floats or the Flexbox, but

36
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.250
I found with grid I did need to do it.

37
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.480
And then the rest of it I think
is pretty straight forward.

38
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.650
I have a div with a class of content,
I have my article.

39
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.950
My asides down here, I grouped together
in a div with a class of aside.

40
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.961
And I think those are sort of the major
changes that I had here in the HTML.

41
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.310
Then in the CSS, as I mentioned,
I added a couple of

42
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.450
extra wrapping elements and
they are in here.

43
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.730
So we have the, let's see,

44
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.190
there's that background image that I
was telling you about for that nav bar.

45
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.850
So it has a height of 12 pixels and it
just has that scallop repeating in the x

46
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.810
direction that sits nicely
on top of the nav bar.

47
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.621
And,
&gt;&gt; Jen: Here in the content outside

48
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.153
of the media query I've added to that, it
gave it that background color and a radius

49
00:02:57.153 --> 00:03:02.707
associated with it and some padding.
&gt;&gt; Jen: And

50
00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:06.169
then really all the magic happens more or
less here in the grid system.

51
00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:11.601
So what I did here was I
set a width on the wrapper

52
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:16.770
of 97% with a max width of 767 pixels.

53
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.890
And then in the content,
that wound up being where my grid was.

54
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.210
We also had the aside, was going to
have the two columns inside of it, so

55
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.010
that'll put the little boxes
next to each other underneath.

56
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.808
So the content and
that right column wound up being

57
00:03:35.808 --> 00:03:39.435
two things that were
placed inside of the grid.

58
00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:42.786
And then there was a nested grid
in that aside over there so that

59
00:03:42.786 --> 00:03:47.727
we could put the two boxes underneath.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, and

60
00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:51.594
then it changed around
here too in the desktop

61
00:03:51.594 --> 00:03:56.700
display.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Does that sort

62
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.388
of vaguely make sense?
&gt;&gt; Jen: There's a ton of code there.

63
00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:06.668
I just sorta hit the high points of what
changed, but you do have the answers

64
00:04:06.668 --> 00:04:10.748
available to you there in the end folder,
so you can take a look at things.
