00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so here, what
you've got is your history page again for

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.180
the Pie in the Sky Bakery,
which we worked on yesterday.

3
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.220
And I believe the one that I've given you
here is the version with flexbox-based

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.250
layouts, as I recall, I think.

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.680
Such a long time ago I wrote this.

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.680
Yes, this is all done with flexbox, so

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.510
you can see the grid systems
written with flexbox.

8
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.317
What I'd like for you to do is I'd
like you to take this history page and

9
00:00:31.317 --> 00:00:33.191
I'd like you to rework it so

10
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:38.346
that it's now laid out using grid
instead of being laid out using flexbox.

11
00:00:38.346 --> 00:00:41.013
And to aid you along that way,

12
00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:46.685
I'd like to show you a couple of
tools that may be useful to you.

13
00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:50.786
And I'm gonna look at
the end state file here,

14
00:00:50.786 --> 00:00:55.560
which looks exactly the same,
more or less.

15
00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.730
My testimonials might be
down a little bit more, but

16
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.840
you will wanna do this in Firefox.

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.900
So somebody put it out earlier today,
Firefox has done a tremendous

18
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.480
job putting in new grid tools
inside of its developer tools.

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.880
So if you were to like right-click
anywhere on the background of this

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.170
website and then go to Inspect Element,
this pulls up the browser inspector.

21
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.630
I know a lot of people like Chrome's.

22
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.570
It's the same kinda thing that is
available to you here in Firefox.

23
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.952
Here's one of the differences.

24
00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:34.195
If you're looking at a page
that is coded with Grid, and

25
00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:38.956
we're looking at an element that happens
to be coded with Grid, so let's say I'm

26
00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:44.600
looking at this article here.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Go ahead and

27
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.712
highlight that article.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

28
00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:56.110
my rules.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we go.

29
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.320
So I've highlighted the content HTML here.

30
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.540
Over on the side here, on the Rules tab
in the CSS, you'll notice that we have

31
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.970
our selectors here followed by what
looks like a little grey item.

32
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.180
And this is a way of highlighting all of
these various Grid cells and so forth.

33
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.046
So this is available to you,
okay, and elements that are like

34
00:02:25.046 --> 00:02:30.077
this.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

35
00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:31.450
those are available to you.

36
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.430
The other thing I wanted to show you
was something that came across my desk

37
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.070
this morning as I was leaving the hotel.

38
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.010
And this is in the developer tools.

39
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.580
What I just showed you is
the standard distribution of Firefox.

40
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.235
There's also the developer
version of Firefox.

41
00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:49.131
If you download the developer
version of Firefox,

42
00:02:49.131 --> 00:02:51.431
this article came across my desk today.

43
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:54.426
And this has got some incredible tools,

44
00:02:54.426 --> 00:03:00.240
which I've had zero time to look at,
because I just saw it this morning.

45
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.620
So you are welcome to take a look at this.

46
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.800
I will give Mark the URL for
this webpage, which is

47
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.510
a quick little introduction
to Grid that Mozilla put out.

48
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.460
And as you see here
they're covering more or

49
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.390
less the same items that
I'm covering here in class.

50
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.760
Talking about the fr unit,
mixing units and so and so forth.

51
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.600
And one of the things they
cover is the Firefox Devtools.

52
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.260
So if you wanted to take a look at this,
this has got some information for you here

53
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.170
and some nice animated GIFs that would
give you a little more information about

54
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.040
some of these tools that are available
to you in Firefox, as well, all right?

55
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.760
So I'm gonna give you,
what do you say, like half an hour?

56
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.670
Is that good for
re-working this history page?

57
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.030
Tear out all the flexbox code and
you're gonna redo it with Grid.

58
00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.416
There's the instructions.

59
00:03:57.416 --> 00:03:58.982
If you wind up with extra time,

60
00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:02.070
you're more than welcome to work
on some of the other pages.

61
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.680
Like last night, you might've coded
up the homepage or a gallery page.

62
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.690
And there's other pages
you can code as well.

63
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.910
If you look inside of the branding folder,
which is outside of the day two folder,

64
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.480
it's up there with day one, day two and
there's a folder called branding.

65
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.740
That has got some images in it,
some colors, some text, if you wanna

66
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.250
code up some more webpages and
get a little bit more practice with Grid.

67
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.560
So feel free to use area,
Grid areas, use the Grid rows and

68
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.458
Grid columns that we've done a lot
with at this point, use some offsets.

69
00:04:37.458 --> 00:04:39.390
Give all of that stuff a try
