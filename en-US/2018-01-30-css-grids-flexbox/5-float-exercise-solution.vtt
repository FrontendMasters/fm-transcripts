00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.380
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So let's go on ahead and

2
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.110
go through the answer here to the float
based grid system really quickly.

3
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.785
Now one of the questions
that we got over the break

4
00:00:08.785 --> 00:00:13.450
was really why are we doing floats,
and that's a great question.

5
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.930
The reason why is this, so first of

6
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.490
all my sense of having been out there in
the field and taught this material a lot

7
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
is that people don't actually understand
how a float-based grid system works.

8
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.570
You guys work with them all the time.

9
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.090
You download them on Bootstrap and
Foundation and blah blah blah, but

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.510
you don't actually build your own and
you're not really sure how they work.

11
00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.710
So that's one, two is you have to
understand the industry standard to

12
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.410
understand where we're going in the field,
so

13
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.530
we are going to be going to flex box and
grid.

14
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.100
If you do not understand how floats work,

15
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.540
you do not understand how we progressively
get better with flex box and grid.

16
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.459
And I feel very strongly about the fact
that you should understand the technology

17
00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:55.134
that you are working with.

18
00:00:55.134 --> 00:00:59.322
So that when your go back to your manager
after the end of this workshop, and

19
00:00:59.322 --> 00:01:01.460
you say, we need to be coding in grid.

20
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.127
And your manager says, great,

21
00:01:03.127 --> 00:01:07.390
and why you actually have an answer
to that question that you can make.

22
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.880
Okay, so let's go ahead and
take a look at the end state,

23
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.430
so we're in the chapter
one Intro floats folder.

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.400
I'm looking at the end state of this.

25
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.020
Now, obviously, once again, you may have
some different ideas for how layouts work.

26
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.000
You may have some different class names.

27
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.620
You may have some slightly different code.

28
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.530
This is my answer that doesn't negate
other answers to this particular problem.

29
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.020
So here is the CSS file,
if you scroll on down to

30
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.010
somewhere around line 32 you'll
see that we have a grid system.

31
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:46.160
And we're writing this mobile first,
so the styles that we have listed here

32
00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.380
that are not inside the media query are
what we'll have on a mobile phone, okay?

33
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.640
As you scroll on down around line 62,

34
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.520
this is where we have what's
going on in the tablet.

35
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.890
And then at the very bottom of the page
is what's happening on desktop.

36
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.620
So I'm gonna sorta skip from mobile
down to desktop here momentarily.

37
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.550
So what I've got going on here for
the grid system is as follows.

38
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.010
The rows are gonna work exactly
the same across all the devices.

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:22.230
So for my row here, this is a fairly
common formula for how a query might work.

40
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.292
We use the class of row,
the pseudo element of after,

41
00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:33.042
and the following formula for
doing that particular clear.

42
00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:36.325
Those of you who noticed that
this one has two colons in it,

43
00:02:36.325 --> 00:02:41.320
whereas the after that we listed up here
at the top of the document has one colon.

44
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.407
You have very sharp eyes good job.

45
00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:46.990
What happened with this was as follows.

46
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.330
These pseudo elements like before and

47
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.970
after are part of the CSS 2
specification where they had one colon.

48
00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.430
In CSS 3, they introduced two colons to
differentiate the pseudo selector from

49
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.960
sorry, the pseudo element from
the pseudo class which has one column.

50
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.973
So either one of this will work or sort
of compatible with browsers, all right?

51
00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:17.930
Then for the mobile purposes, all of
my classes are going to be the same.

52
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.580
All of my columns are exactly the same
size, so what I have here is.

53
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.716
A width of 92%, why 92%?

54
00:03:25.716 --> 00:03:31.065
Because I have a margin of 4% on the left
already associated with the style, and

55
00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:36.506
then that leaves 4% left over to just sort
of wind up on the right side of the page.

56
00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:40.570
Or actually, I guess I assigned it,
so that's the margin left and right.

57
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.520
You'll notice I have also given this
a minimum height of 1 pixel that's our

58
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.030
browser have for Internet Explorer.

59
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.016
One of the versions of Internet Explorer
that gets mad when there is no content,

60
00:03:50.016 --> 00:03:53.483
so, there we go, that's everything
that's happening on mobile.

61
00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.223
After that I have all of may
mother stewards colors here,

62
00:03:56.223 --> 00:03:58.030
that's what those are.

63
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.270
And then I'm gonna skip
on down to Desktop.

64
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.230
Let's take a look at what's
going on at desktop.

65
00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.790
These are the width,
the width are going to change, so,

66
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.900
the fact that were floating,

67
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.290
the fact that I have a margin that's
gonna be the same across all devices.

68
00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.870
And again,
that is the design decision that I made.

69
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.660
You as a developer may
choose to make those margins

70
00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.180
smaller with a smaller devices, there's
absolutely nothing wrong with that.

71
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.251
Feel free to do that and then your
values here will be slightly different.

72
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:30.910
But what we've got going on
here is with the column one,

73
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.480
so in another words the individual cells,

74
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.720
there width is gonna be 20% for
those adds up to 80.

75
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.570
And then we have five locations for
the margin at 4% each,

76
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:51.771
5 times 4 is 20, add that to 80,
we get 100%, okay.

77
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:55.564
Column two, column three, column four,
that's how the math works out for

78
00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:56.879
those particular items.

79
00:04:59.112 --> 00:05:04.125
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: When we go to the tablet
sizes here, what we've got going on

80
00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:09.942
is I've cancelled out my margin on
the right from my mobile styles and

81
00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:13.470
I have different sizes here for my width.

82
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.430
And I'll show you what's
going on here in my HTML.

83
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.920
You'll notice that I have a class
that's called col-1-2 and a col-1-4.

84
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.400
Those indicate that I have a column that
is one, in other words one column wide,

85
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.120
at say desktop dimensions it will
go to either two columns wide or

86
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.970
four columns wide.

87
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.000
At the tablet and
potentially mobile dimensions.

88
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.370
So, and I'll show you where
that happens in the HTML.

89
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:52.010
So, in the first row here, these
articles are all clause of column 1-2.

90
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.980
Okay so, they’re gonna be
four going across the page.

91
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.930
When it collapses it goes to two across,
right?

92
00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.620
So that’s the behavior of these
yellow ones here on the top row.

93
00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.310
Four individually and
then they go to two and two, all right?

94
00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.840
But, in row three here,
we have a different behavior going on.

95
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.860
I have one column wide here at desktop
dimensions, but I want it to stack

96
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.710
one on top of the other when we get
down here to tablet dimensions, okay?

97
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.480
So that is different behavior
at tablet and mobile dimensions.

98
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.080
And so I need a different style for that.

99
00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.752
So that I called that one col-1-4 and

100
00:06:34.752 --> 00:06:40.260
you'll see that I assign that
down here on line 56, okay.

101
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.920
So basically the markup for
all of these looks pretty much the same,

102
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.870
we have a div with a class of row.

103
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.760
I've marked these up as articles,
each one of the little content

104
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.560
blurbs it is a title, it is a picture,
it has paragraph, it has a read more link.

105
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.770
I've call those articles because they're
probably syndicatable in some method

106
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:00.980
or another.

107
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.520
The row itself is only
serving as a clear and so

108
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.080
therefore I've chosen a div tag for
marking that up here.

109
00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.513
All right, are there any questions on
this material at this point in time.

110
00:07:14.513 --> 00:07:17.990
And I'm gonna wait here for a second cuz
I'm told there is like one minute lag.

111
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.010
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So
where is the tablet media query?

112
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:30.123
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The tablet media
query is right here line 62, 63.

113
00:07:30.123 --> 00:07:31.139
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

114
00:07:31.139 --> 00:07:33.708
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So 48,
minimum with the 480.

115
00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:35.092
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Do you guys understand like

116
00:07:35.092 --> 00:07:36.151
the whole minimum within.

117
00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:40.352
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yes, and then the only
screen end, what does that do?

118
00:07:40.352 --> 00:07:42.628
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So,
that’s gonna work on the screen, but

119
00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.550
it may not necessarily work
on other types of devices.

120
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.895
It may not necessarily do that for print.

121
00:07:47.895 --> 00:07:48.395
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay.

122
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.460
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You can leave that out,
remember media queries.

123
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.790
This is a common thing we forget
working in responsive design.

124
00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:02.350
We always use media queries in this
way in terms of how big our screen is.

125
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.618
But actually media queries also pertain
to, print style sheets, we use to

126
00:08:07.618 --> 00:08:12.983
do a print style sheet back in the old
days, now we do those by media queries.

127
00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:16.047
So media query can hold our print styles.

128
00:08:16.047 --> 00:08:20.786
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: In
the floats.CSS on line 64.

129
00:08:20.786 --> 00:08:21.845
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Line 64.

130
00:08:21.845 --> 00:08:25.686
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Why is the attribute
selector under the mobile landscape media

131
00:08:25.686 --> 00:08:26.199
query?

132
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.450
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so why does
this selector exist here on line 64?

133
00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:34.120
Why is it here on mobile?

134
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:40.360
So if you take a look first up here on,
sorry, why does it exist here on tablet?

135
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.350
So this outside on Line
39 is a similar selector.

136
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.070
This is the way this is gonna
display on a mobile phone.

137
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.110
So it'll be 92% wide with a 4%
margin on the left and the right.

138
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.120
When we go to a larger screen dimension,

139
00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.440
over 480 pixels,
I get rid of the margin on the right.

140
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.140
Because now I'm gonna have multiple
cells next to each other and

141
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.870
I don't wanna have margin on the left and
the right,

142
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:07.982
and that adds together to 8%
instead of just being 4%.

143
00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:13.395
And I want this to be floated to the left,
remember that here on,

144
00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:19.434
the style here on line 39 there's
actually no float that's called.

145
00:09:19.434 --> 00:09:23.779
We're just stacking things on top
of each other for our form, so

146
00:09:23.779 --> 00:09:27.010
here we actually call out
the float on the left.

147
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:31.911
Now because of the way these media queries
are written with a minimum width of 480.

148
00:09:31.911 --> 00:09:35.651
Any of the styles that are here
inside of the tablet or

149
00:09:35.651 --> 00:09:42.230
as I called the mobile landscape screen
size, carry down into the desktop as well.

150
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:49.253
Unless we specifically override
them in the desktop media query.

151
00:09:49.253 --> 00:09:52.232
Okay, so hopefully that helps some.

152
00:09:52.232 --> 00:09:55.100
Do we have other questions, Mark?

153
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Why not put the clear
directly on the row instead of row

154
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.760
after psuedo element?

155
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Because this is typically,
basically, because this is the formula.

156
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.937
This is the way that it's typically done.

157
00:10:08.937 --> 00:10:11.621
