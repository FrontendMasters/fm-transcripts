00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.635
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Chapter 14 is the grid
offsets, I've actually already told you

2
00:00:03.635 --> 00:00:07.032
about this so here is what I'd like
you to do with the grid offsets.

3
00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:13.528
Go on ahead and open offset.html and
offset.css, and what I'd like for

4
00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:18.658
you to do is, I'd like for
you to just make the page display

5
00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:24.651
in the following way.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

6
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:28.607
so I'd like you to take those
asides that you just had.

7
00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:32.516
You're gonna get rid of the one
that's in the middle here and

8
00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:36.357
I want you to have one on this side,
one on that side, okay?

9
00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:38.300
Does that make sense?

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.641
Okay, and
the HTML that you're starting with just so

11
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:46.582
you know what it looks like,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It looks like that.

12
00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:48.949
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

13
00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.444
So take the page that looks like that,

14
00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:58.352
make it look like this give you
like 10 minutes, is that good?

15
00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:03.053
All right 10 minutes.
&gt;&gt; Student: Quick actually one question is

16
00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:04.675
popping here.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

17
00:01:04.675 --> 00:01:07.541
&gt;&gt; Student: When you hear by in grid

18
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:11.952
template columns,
what precisely is repeat,

19
00:01:11.952 --> 00:01:16.019
repeating and repeat for ,1fr?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

20
00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:20.331
So let me pull up the code
that he's talking about here.

21
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:21.301
There we go.

22
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:26.299
Okay, so here,
this is the nesting.css document that we

23
00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.692
were just working with,
I'm on line number 47.

24
00:01:30.692 --> 00:01:32.919
And so he's asking what this syntax means?

25
00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:37.916
Repeat, 3,1fr, so
what we're indicating here is that we

26
00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:43.313
would like 3 columns, and
each column would be 1 fraction each.

27
00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:48.982
So this is essentially,
this 3fr is the same thing,

28
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.908
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: As if I said this, 1fr,

29
00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.650
1fr, 1fr.

30
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.967
Those are syntactically different but
they function exactly the same.
