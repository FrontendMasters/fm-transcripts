00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What did you
wind up getting here then for

2
00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.160
your grid template areas?

3
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:13.540
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So it's gonna be .wrapper.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.898
Yeah, bring this up a little bit.

5
00:00:18.464 --> 00:00:19.735
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
it's gonna be the .wrapper class.

6
00:00:19.735 --> 00:00:25.101
It's gonna be grid-template-areas.

7
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:27.796
And what did you get for an answer?

8
00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:32.780
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That should look like that.

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.592
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So would it be,
sidebar sidebar header header, and

10
00:00:36.592 --> 00:00:41.019
then the next one would be
sidebar sidebar article article?

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:50.397
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Header, header and
then sidebar sidebar article article.

12
00:00:50.397 --> 00:00:51.550
Is that what you did?

13
00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:54.426
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, let's try that.

14
00:00:58.096 --> 00:00:59.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If we refresh the page?

15
00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:03.226
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's pretty close,
it's pretty close.

16
00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:07.417
We could probably argue that this would

17
00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:12.246
actually be header, maybe an article here.

18
00:01:16.102 --> 00:01:19.874
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And just push that sidebar
over just a little bit more, but, yeah,

19
00:01:19.874 --> 00:01:21.209
you're pretty close.

20
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:29.193
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so the question was,
why do we specify header four times?

21
00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:32.074
So why don't we just try that?

22
00:01:32.074 --> 00:01:34.957
Let's just say sidebar header, and

23
00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:39.053
let's just say sidebar article and
see what we get.

24
00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.422
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so if we do that,
just say sidebar header and

25
00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:49.633
sidebar article, save that,
refresh your browser.

26
00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.800
And it looks like that is working also,
okay.

27
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.330
And that is probably because of the way
that we declared these columns up here in

28
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.630
the top, the 1 and the 3 together.

29
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.968
Okay, so if instead I did this, repeat (4,

30
00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:13.342
1fr), right, so now I'm 4,
4 columns, one fraction each.

31
00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:17.814
Do you think it's still gonna
work down here with the desktop.

32
00:02:17.814 --> 00:02:19.552
You think it's still gonna work?

33
00:02:19.552 --> 00:02:22.483
How many say it's still gonna work?

34
00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.575
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many say,
no, it totally won't work?

35
00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:28.725
A few more.

36
00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:30.839
How many say, I have absolutely no idea?

37
00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.068
That always gets the most votes.

38
00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:37.820
Okay, so if you go in ahead and
save that and

39
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.589
refresh the page, so this is what you get.

40
00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:47.992
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right,
so the combination then, so

41
00:02:47.992 --> 00:02:53.084
here where we just said 4
columns of 1 fraction each,

42
00:02:53.084 --> 00:02:58.084
then it becomes important
to specify header header.

43
00:03:01.047 --> 00:03:06.710
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And article article, okay?

44
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.190
So then it becomes important
to specify those, right?

45
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.090
So that we get the correct layout.

46
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.812
Or we need to spell out our
column widths like this,

47
00:03:19.812 --> 00:03:23.500
1fr 4fr.

48
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.380
And then down here in our
desktop dimension again,

49
00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.010
we could just say sidebar header or
sidebar article.

50
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.525
And those will correspond with those
widths of those columns above.

51
00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.324
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Make sense?

52
00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:44.689
All right,
any questions on that grid area stuff?

53
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.180
We're gonna do more with it.

54
00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.150
But I'm gonna hit a couple of
topics in rapid succession.

55
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.958
And then we're gonna go
do a longer exercise.

56
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:57.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

57
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.420
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So that's grid area.

58
00:04:04.014 --> 00:04:04.736
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm sorry,

59
00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:08.580
I forgot one more thing I have
to show you with grid area.

60
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.465
Open back up your grid area .css file.

61
00:04:14.238 --> 00:04:18.960
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,
so, that should be 3fr.

62
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:23.810
Here's another piece of syntax
that you can use with grid area.

63
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.210
So let's say that I wanted to have
an empty column between the sidebar and

64
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.280
the header and the article, okay?

65
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.518
So just for consistency sake, I'm gonna
change this back to repeat (4, 1fr).

66
00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:45.240
So now I have 4 columns, 1 fraction each.

67
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.695
I have a sidebar header header and

68
00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:53.359
I have an article article.

69
00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.500
What I'd like to do now is I'd
like to place an empty column in

70
00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.126
between the sidebar and

71
00:04:59.126 --> 00:05:03.775
the header and an empty column
between the sidebar and the article.

72
00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:07.329
So the way you can do this
is with the dot notation.

73
00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:10.064
The minimum number of dots is one.

74
00:05:10.064 --> 00:05:13.100
You can have more than
one dot if you wish.

75
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.408
So you could just say ...,
that's kind of a nice way of doing it.

76
00:05:16.408 --> 00:05:18.636
You can have many, many,
many dots if you want.

77
00:05:18.636 --> 00:05:23.061
But this is going to create an empty

78
00:05:23.061 --> 00:05:27.495
column in the display of the page.

79
00:05:27.495 --> 00:05:32.219
So if you go on ahead and
save that and refresh your web page,

80
00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.360
you should see a nice big gap here.

81
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.856
And of course,
these fractions are quite large.

82
00:05:37.856 --> 00:05:40.584
So it's a quite large gap
that we have in our layout,

83
00:05:40.584 --> 00:05:43.385
probably larger than you'd
really want design was.

84
00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:44.790
But it's a thing that you can do here.

85
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.846
You, of course, don't have to put
it in the two column locations.

86
00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:58.749
You can simply say I only want it here,
between the sidebar and the article.

87
00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.870
So we could set that up,
and that will also work.

88
00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.339
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, make sense?

89
00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:11.440
So this is something that you can
do with this grid area syntax that

90
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.930
you really are less able to do with
just using grid column and grid row.

91
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.908
If you wanted to have that empty
column somewhere along the way,

92
00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:21.908
that becomes a little bit more difficult.

93
00:06:21.908 --> 00:06:28.410
It becomes much easier to implement here
using this grid template area syntax, yes?

94
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.395
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: What if we want the space
to be smaller than one fraction?

95
00:06:32.395 --> 00:06:35.798
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: If you want the space
to be smaller than one fraction here,

96
00:06:35.798 --> 00:06:40.382
then what we'd need to do for our grid
template columns is we'd need that set up

97
00:06:40.382 --> 00:06:42.898
some kind of different kind of thing here.

98
00:06:42.898 --> 00:06:50.007
Let's say it's 1fr 0.2fr 1fr 1fr.

99
00:06:50.007 --> 00:06:50.737
Let's see what that does.

100
00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:54.848
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That may or may not work.

101
00:06:57.934 --> 00:06:58.621
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So
that helped a little bit.

102
00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.164
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, and it would probably
work better if I actually had that total

103
00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:09.801
it to a whole number instead of
3.2 fractions for the whole page.

104
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:14.206
[LAUGH] But that's what I did.
