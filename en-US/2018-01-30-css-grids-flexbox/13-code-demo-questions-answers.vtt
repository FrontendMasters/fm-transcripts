00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:02.610
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Anybody have
any questions at this point?

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.260
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: What is the middle number of

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.596
the shorthand?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What's

4
00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.045
the middle number of the shorthand?

5
00:00:07.045 --> 00:00:15.134
Grow-shrink, grow-shrink.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Or

6
00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:19.414
sorry, [LAUGH] woo,
flex hyphens shrink, not grow-shrink.

7
00:00:19.414 --> 00:00:22.711
Grow is the first number,
shrink's the second number, and

8
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:25.976
flex-basis is the third number.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And why do we never use

9
00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:29.040
the width property again?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Why don't we ever use

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.670
the width property?

11
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.910
Because the width property is an absolute

12
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.800
value.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay.

13
00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.480
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Even when we used so-called

14
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.070
relative units that are adaptive,
like percent or uPort,

15
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.080
heights and widths, they really aren't.

16
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.334
They're always 25%.

17
00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:48.060
The flex-basis could be larger or
smaller as you see here.

18
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.590
That box number five here,
its flex-basis is set to 50%.

19
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:53.760
Clearly, it's not that.

20
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.468
Okay.
So they are more flexible than a true

21
00:00:58.468 --> 00:01:02.391
width property.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the grow actually

22
00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:04.038
kill the basis?

23
00:01:04.038 --> 00:01:06.180
It's like the basis doesn't work now,
he's saying.

24
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.810
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, right, so the grow and

25
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.620
the shrink definitely can kill the basis.

26
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.050
Here's the same example,
just using the grow property.

27
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.793
So even though we said the basis was 50%,

28
00:01:15.793 --> 00:01:21.512
clearly box number 5 is not 50%.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Do you

29
00:01:21.512 --> 00:01:24.710
have an example of how this would be used?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How this could be used?

30
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, like in-

31
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.447
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, those examples

32
00:01:26.447 --> 00:01:28.550
are coming soon.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

33
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.584
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [LAUGH] That's like

34
00:01:29.584 --> 00:01:31.390
the whole rest of the day.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Cool.

35
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.670
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm not gonna get too

36
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.900
much into.

37
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.950
This is like the brainy theory stuff, and

38
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.440
the next thing we're gonna
do is we're gonna apply it.

39
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.050
So are we good with questions on

40
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.570
the Internet?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: People are asking what's

41
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.318
the default grow value?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

42
00:01:46.318 --> 00:01:51.547
the default values are zero for
grow, one for

43
00:01:51.547 --> 00:01:56.233
shrink, and auto for the flex-basis.

44
00:01:56.233 --> 00:02:00.639
And again, if you take a look at
your flexboxproperties.txt document,

45
00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:04.987
I've actually got that in there in
those notes down towards the bottom.

46
00:02:07.328 --> 00:02:08.533
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes?

47
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:10.329
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I just had a question about

48
00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.284
the order of property.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sure.

49
00:02:13.284 --> 00:02:15.448
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you changed a number,

50
00:02:15.448 --> 00:02:17.612
yeah, is it relevant and

51
00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:22.220
what is it gonna do?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So if we change the number

52
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.630
for the order property,
it's going to put these

53
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.741
items in a different order basically.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's all it's gonna do?

54
00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:31.667
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's basically all

55
00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:32.352
it's gonna do.

56
00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:36.496
And if you wanted to see
more of an example of that,

57
00:02:36.496 --> 00:02:44.016
let's change these numbers to flex1, 2,
3, 4, that's probably enough, right?

58
00:02:44.016 --> 00:02:49.690
5 and 6,
then we could write styles for that.

59
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.331
So I could say .flex6,

60
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:58.755
let's say order of 1.

61
00:02:58.755 --> 00:03:02.300
When we hit Return a few times, you guys
can continue to see what's going on here.

62
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.493
And then if I said .flex3
was order of 2 and

63
00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:15.247
let's say flex4 has an order of

64
00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:20.178
let's say 10 because we don't

65
00:03:20.178 --> 00:03:26.180
even have 10 items, all right?

66
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.570
Just to show you,
you can have whatever number you want.

67
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.232
And if we go ahead and
we refresh the screen,

68
00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.660
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So it's harder, let's see.

69
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.871
Let me take off the order here.

70
00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:44.874
I'm gonna remove order from flex2.

71
00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:49.093
So what we would expect to see is
flex6 maybe towards the beginning,

72
00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:53.840
maybe flex3 immediately following that,
and flex4 at the end.

73
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.957
And if we refresh the page, so

74
00:03:58.957 --> 00:04:04.754
did I save my HTML?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No,

75
00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:07.730
always helps if you save your HTML first.

76
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.310
Okay, so now it's gonna work just great.

77
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.180
There we go.

78
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.820
We're going one, two,
five, six, three and four.

79
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.940
So we're just changing
the order around here.

80
00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.100
So you can imagine this being really
applicable to a grid system where you

81
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.190
wanna reorder boxes on the page.

82
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.550
You write your HTML in the order that you
actually want a search engine to read it,

83
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.150
or the order that you want it
to appear on a mobile design.

84
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.730
And then using this order property,
you can swap your boxes around so

85
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:37.730
that things appear in
exactly the order you want.

86
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:39.330
Pretty awesome.

87
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.479
Yes, Mark?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Brandon's saying, well,

88
00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.532
flexbox isn't a grid system.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Correct.

89
00:04:46.532 --> 00:04:48.577
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: But isn't it fine for

90
00:04:48.577 --> 00:04:51.166
page layout?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: but isn't it fine for

91
00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:54.582
page layout?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Like sidebar fixed header,

92
00:04:54.582 --> 00:04:58.644
main content.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, technically, no.

93
00:04:58.644 --> 00:05:03.416
So again, grid is the correct
way to lay out webpages.

94
00:05:03.416 --> 00:05:08.393
But obviously, as you know,
grid support is still right on the edge.

95
00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:12.971
I'm gonna go through a whole lot of
stuff with grid tomorrow including

96
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:15.710
cross-browser compatibility issues.

97
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:21.950
So ideally, in a perfect world, flexbox
is really not used in a grid context.

98
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.667
But I'm still gonna show you to do it
today anyway, because it's out there and

99
00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:28.672
people are doing it.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Mike has

100
00:05:28.672 --> 00:05:29.496
a question.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

101
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.874
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So it's good practice to not

102
00:05:31.874 --> 00:05:35.541
use flex shorthand, but
to write shrink and

103
00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:39.038
grow all out?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay.

104
00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:40.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I don't know, I guess-

105
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.828
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, I don't know-

106
00:05:41.828 --> 00:05:43.573
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It seems like a preference.

107
00:05:43.573 --> 00:05:44.212
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It seems to me

108
00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:47.526
to be a coding preference is to
whether you'd write something out or

109
00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:48.900
you'd use the shorthand.

110
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.780
Generally speaking, what I've seen
online with most properties is

111
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.230
that if the shorthand is available,
a lot of people will use it.

112
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.870
But, again, we have options, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Can we set

113
00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.365
negative order values?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Negative order values,

114
00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:04.400
sure, let's give it a shot.

115
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.507
So if we go here,
let's set flex4 to a -10, so

116
00:06:09.507 --> 00:06:14.510
what would we expect to
see if flex4 is a -10?

117
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.040
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The beginning probably.

118
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.042
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Box number four may be

119
00:06:17.042 --> 00:06:18.440
at the beginning, okay.

120
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.476
So let's do that and refresh the page.

121
00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:28.340
Sure enough, flexbox number four is at
the very beginning of the order here.

122
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.359
So yes, negative numbers are great.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

123
00:06:30.359 --> 00:06:32.513
the order starts with zero, right?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: An order,

124
00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:41.583
I believe it actually starts with one.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Other

125
00:06:41.583 --> 00:06:46.674
questions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Why

126
00:06:46.674 --> 00:06:51.183
would the last box get the width 100%?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Why would the last box get

127
00:06:51.183 --> 00:06:52.265
the width 100%?

128
00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:59.273
Well, that just happens to be the way that
we had set up this particular example.

129
00:06:59.273 --> 00:07:00.893
In that, previously,

130
00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:06.077
before I started making all these changes
to this code, box number three and

131
00:07:06.077 --> 00:07:11.920
five had the class associated with them
that set their flex-basis to 50%, okay?

132
00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.810
So they were next to each other,

133
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.084
until I got the screen big enough that
one jumped up to the previous row and

134
00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:23.110
the last one was left and it widened to
take up the full width of that second row.

135
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.840
That's what happened.
