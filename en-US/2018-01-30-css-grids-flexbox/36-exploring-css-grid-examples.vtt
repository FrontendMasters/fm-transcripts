1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.800
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Here we have the same
drawing that you've been looking at now

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.670
for two days.

3
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.690
But we've changed it
just slightly this time.

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.190
So I have a wrapper going around
this particular bunch of cells that

5
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.160
are inside of this, and each cell notice,
has a different class this time.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.160
So rather than calling out a single class
name and applying it to multiple cells,

7
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.110
every cell here has it's own unique class,
all right?

8
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.205
So this is very important because,

9
00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:32.330
[COUGH] this is the way that we're
gonna wind up having to specify.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.580
Because now we have to specify
our cells in two dimensions.

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.800
And if two cells have the same
two-dimensional layout, what are they?

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.445
On top of each other, make sense?

13
00:00:44.445 --> 00:00:49.810
Okay, so previously, we could just have
one cell all next to each other, right?

14
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.280
And they'd lay out in a row but

15
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.770
now, because we have to specify both
the horizontal and the vertical.

16
00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.160
If the two cells have the same dimensions
they are on top of each other for

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.830
better or for worse.

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.470
Okay, so just like flex backs
where we had parents and children,

19
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.280
we had flex containers and
we had flex items same kind of thing here.

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.680
We have grid containers and
grid items okay?

21
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.380
So the parent here's the wrapper,
the cells are the children.

22
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.490
So the wrapper is going to have
a very simple code to get it started.

23
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.540
So the wrapper with the display grid and
a grid gap of ten pixels.

24
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.090
If you're offended by pixels, I apologize.

25
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.760
[LAUGH] When I started making
these slides, five months ago or

26
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.200
six months ago, pixels were the only thing
supported by the browser for grid gap.

27
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.720
And like a few days ago I tried it with
Ms and it actually worked with Ms, so

28
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.160
that bug finally got fixed, okay?

29
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.730
So be aware that you don't have to use
pixels anymore for the grid gap, but

30
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.450
it was a thing for a little while.

31
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.915
You could only,
it would only work with pixels.

32
00:01:55.915 --> 00:02:00.505
And of course,
what do you think the grid gap is?

33
00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:01.430
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The space between.

34
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.375
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The space between

35
00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:03.261
the grid cells.

36
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:04.218
Space between the grid cells.

37
00:02:04.218 --> 00:02:09.500
Okay, ohis is how we're going to start
to specify our grid cells on our page.

38
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.600
This is the first kind of syntax
we're gonna learn for this.

39
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.620
So we have our wrapper on the outside.

40
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.850
That's the pair where we declare that it's
a grid and we we can declare grid gap.

41
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.680
And there's some other properties
we're gonna add as the day goes on.

42
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.810
In order to specify ourselves,

43
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.730
what you're going to think about
is the series of numbers, okay?

44
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.940
And the numbers are sort of
four column system like this or

45
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.960
as I've specified them up here.

46
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.980
So just before the start of
the first cell is line one,

47
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.650
just after that first cell is line two,
make sense?

48
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.780
Okay and then we can then
specify exactly how we want our

49
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.290
grid cells to however we want them to be.

50
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.389
Just by doing a grid column here, right?

51
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.290
So we are going to go from one to two and
then the second one here,

52
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.560
we're going to go from two to three.

53
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.772
The third one,
we're going to go from three to four.

54
00:03:01.772 --> 00:03:07.227
What would the call for class look like?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Four

55
00:03:07.227 --> 00:03:09.264
to five?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Four to five.

56
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.460
What if I wanted column 1 here to go and
occupy the first two cells?

57
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.030
What would its numbers be?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One, two,

58
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.544
three.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One

59
00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:25.180
three.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I will

60
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.697
tell you that it is possible that if you
really want you can name these lines

61
00:03:28.697 --> 00:03:30.410
instead of doing the number thing.

62
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.320
But personally,
being the minimalist that I am,

63
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.890
I don't see a whole lot of
point in naming my lines.

64
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.050
Like, writing the code to name the lines,

65
00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.610
then doing the extra typing
to name those lines, but

66
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.271
it is a thing you can do [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You mentioned that you could

67
00:03:46.271 --> 00:03:50.547
also span it, so instead of saying one
to three, you could say, span one two?

68
00:03:50.547 --> 00:03:52.170
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes, you can also do that.

69
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.670
There is a span keyword
you can do as well, yes.

70
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.435
But again, that's four extra
characters you have to type [LAUGH].

71
00:03:59.435 --> 00:04:03.830
So by doing the slash here,
that also works.

72
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.230
Okay, [COUGH] so what if we made a little
bit more complicated sort of layout

73
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.060
here.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Not only the grid-column

74
00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.730
are we gonna work with now, but
we're also gonna work with grid-row.

75
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:17.630
Make sense?

76
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.550
So the columns are going across the page
vertically, one column, two columns,

77
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.870
three columns, the rows are going
down the page horizontally.

78
00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.210
And the number thing works exactly
the same way with the rows as it does with

79
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.200
the columns.

80
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.210
So here we go.

81
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.190
We can just go on ahead and
call out a series of grid columns and

82
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.640
grid row values, and that winds up
being the layout for the webpage.

83
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.740
So like I said, I'm gonna just sort of
mention alternative syntax at the moment.

84
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.370
We're gonna go through a little
bit of this later on today.

85
00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.131
So the name of the grid template areas
is something we're gonna cover later on

86
00:04:52.131 --> 00:04:52.654
today.

87
00:04:52.654 --> 00:04:55.550
You can also call out some patterns.

88
00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.510
So some number of rows an/or columns,
that way.

89
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.430
But we're gonna master this first kind
of syntax, calling out the grid row and

90
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.150
the grid column.

91
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.110
You're just using the numbers.

92
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.880
We're gonna focus on that for
a little while, get comfortable with that.

93
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.070
And then I'll go into some of this other
syntax that you might have heard of

94
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.920
later on in the day.

95
00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.810
Okay, so reordering is super
easy with grid as well.

96
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.900
Let say that you have this type of layout.

97
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.290
You can put this in the exact
order that you want for

98
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.400
search engine optimization or
your mobile, the boxes on top of each

99
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.470
other exactly what order you
want it on your mobile screen.

100
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.310
Or the order that you want for
accessibility and hopefully all three of

101
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.290
those things are exactly the same, [LAUGH]
so that stuff gets served up correctly.

102
00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.110
So your HTML source order can
be exactly what you want.

103
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.703
And then it's very easy to reorder and
I will go ahead and

104
00:05:49.703 --> 00:05:55.098
show you that.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [COUGH] So

105
00:05:55.098 --> 00:05:58.751
I'm in if you're following along at home,

106
00:05:58.751 --> 00:06:03.710
I'm in the day two grid folder,
chapter eight grid intro.

107
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.570
And I am opening up
reordering that HTML and

108
00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.829
reordering.CSS.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: And

109
00:06:14.829 --> 00:06:16.387
I'll show you what that code looks like.

110
00:06:16.387 --> 00:06:19.710
So, here's the really cool thing here.

111
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.000
So we've got a super simple layout, right,

112
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.220
a header, some kind of article and
an aside.

113
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.360
As we start to shrink this page down,
we can completely reorder

114
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.090
everything on the page, totally radically
different than what we had before, okay?

115
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.930
And then of course,
come to a mobile layout like this,okay.

116
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.630
So that's pretty amazing, that is not
something that you would really be able

117
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.210
to do with floats at all, okay.

118
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.070
So the HTML for
that is really super simple.

119
00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.930
We have just a header, we have
an article with some blah, blah and

120
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.780
we have our side, right?

121
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.520
And then in our reordering here,
all I've done is for

122
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.110
my wrapper I have my display of grid and
my grid gap ten pixels.

123
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.610
Okay.

124
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.190
The wrapper header article aside,

125
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.060
that's all got just some
colors associated with it.

126
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:25.790
And then down here in my media queries
I've simply calling out where these things

127
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.610
should appear on the web page
using grid column and grid row.
