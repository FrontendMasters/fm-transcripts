WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.890
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So, where we're
going to start here is in my notes.

2
00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.940
So the first group that we're gonna work
with has to do with the flex containers.

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.360
So, remember that's the ul?

4
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.710
That's going to be the outside parent of
all the li's that are inside of this, and

5
00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.060
we're going to add
the following properties.

6
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.240
So, to the ul, we're gonna start
by adding a display of flex.

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.762
So on the ul, go ahead and

8
00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:28.518
add display: flex.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH]

9
00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:32.240
That's all I want you to do,
if you just do that much.

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.020
And refresh your web browser.

11
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.800
You have the easiest nav bar you've
ever built in your entire life.

12
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.700
Look at that, yes.

13
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.823
We are already cheering in the classroom.

14
00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:45.460
Yay!

15
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.180
Okay, so that's all we did,

16
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.460
one property-value pair and
this is what we get.

17
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.310
And of course, if we start to shrink this
down, you'll see, obviously we haven't

18
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.260
done anything with media queries,
and in this demo I'm not going to.

19
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.970
So this is not necessarily set to wrap and
go boxes on top of each other.

20
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:05.730
So basically,

21
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.530
this collapses until we've reached the
maximum ability of each of these boxes.

22
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.960
Each box is being held open
by one long fake Latin word.

23
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.480
And after that point we start to cut
off the rest of the screen here, okay?

24
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.730
So yay, yay flex box.

25
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.690
Okay, so then that's what that particular

26
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.306
property does.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

27
00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:34.960
then the next thing we're
gonna do is number two.

28
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.450
So we're gonna pick something
called the flex-direction.

29
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.290
So, flex-direction has
a bunch of properties, row,

30
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.360
row reverse, column and column reverse.

31
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.550
Let's try some of those.

32
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.650
So here on the ul,
we're gonna say flex-direction.

33
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.450
And row is the default value, so
you've already seen row in action.

34
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.941
So if we set this to, say, column,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [COUGH] And

35
00:02:03.941 --> 00:02:10.800
refresh the page, shockingly they stack on
top of each other in a column, all right?

36
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.845
And of course,
you can shrink this page down,

37
00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:21.040
just like that, great, okay?

38
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.280
Now the ones that probably interest you
somewhat are the reverse ones, right?

39
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.320
So if we say row-reverse,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: As a value,

40
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.070
and refresh the page.

41
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.340
Notice that we now instead of going
one to six, we go six to one.

42
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.206
Basically it takes all of the content
that you had on that row, and

43
00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:46.938
displays it in reverse order,
cool, all right?

44
00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:49.518
And likewise if you instead
of saying row-reverse,

45
00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:53.997
you said column-reverse,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You'll wind up

46
00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:56.865
with the thing displayed vertically, but

47
00:02:56.865 --> 00:03:01.368
six to one instead of one to six.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay?

48
00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:05.220
So far so good?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right.

49
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.630
Some of this stuff you kind of
look at at the beginning and

50
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.420
you go, why would I ever want to
reverse the order of things in my row?

51
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.318
But you never know, you might come up
with a use for it at some point in time.

52
00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:21.678
Okay, the other thing that we can do,
I'm gonna go ahead and set display flex,

53
00:03:21.678 --> 00:03:26.244
I'm gonna set flex-direction back
to row when I go back to my code.

54
00:03:26.244 --> 00:03:30.465
And then we are gonna add a property
called flex-wrap, so, the values for

55
00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.751
that are wrap, wrap reverse or no wrap.

56
00:03:32.751 --> 00:03:37.334
So as I say, here are the flex-direction
is ordering those individual items, one,

57
00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:39.680
two, three, four, five, six.

58
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.670
Flex-wrap is ordering the rows or
the columns that are created.

59
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.800
So let's see that in action.

60
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.819
So I'm gonna go back to my CSS,

61
00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.007
I'm gonna set my flex-direction to row.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

62
00:03:54.007 --> 00:04:01.890
I'm gonna set my flex-wrap, let's just
go on ahead and say wrap to start with.

63
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.630
And these are the default values that come
with Flexbox, for the most part, right

64
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.630
out of the box, this is the flex-direction
of row and the flex-wrap of wrap.

65
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.508
And so, if we look at our web page,
it goes one to six, and

66
00:04:17.508 --> 00:04:23.135
you see here, that now my flex
items are as wide as their content.

67
00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:28.547
When we run out of room, we place
them next to each other horizontally.

68
00:04:28.547 --> 00:04:32.970
When we run out of room,
we simply go onto another line, okay?

69
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.920
So that's what the wrap
property is doing here.

70
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.030
And as we scrunch the screen down here,

71
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.380
you see that we just go on to
another line, just like that.

72
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.830
Until we wind up with
everything on one line.

73
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.995
Yes, if you had that question,
can I set the width for those flex items?

74
00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:54.650
Width, yes, you can.

75
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.330
We're getting there, okay.

76
00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.410
But right now the width is
determined by the content.

77
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.150
And I should show you some
other properties besides wrap.

78
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.083
So if I said, wrap-reverse, anyone want
to take a guess at what wrap-reverse is

79
00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:12.770
gonna do?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It reverses the list.

80
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.530
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So one to six,

81
00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.260
let's go six to one.

82
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.794
Yeah, so if you save that and
refresh the page, here we go.

83
00:05:20.794 --> 00:05:22.368
Sort of, right?

84
00:05:22.368 --> 00:05:26.640
Five and six, and then one,
two, three, four underneath.

85
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.610
So not quite six, five, four, three,
two, one but we're ordering by the row.

86
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.404
And as we scrunch down,
see how it's reacting in real time, so

87
00:05:37.404 --> 00:05:40.280
four, five, six, one, two, three, okay?

88
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:49.350
Six, four, five, one, two, three, weird,
but that's what it's doing, okay?

89
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.348
And then of course,

90
00:05:50.348 --> 00:05:56.090
anyone wanna guess what nowrap does?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's a hyphen, right?

91
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:57.460
No, one word, nowrap.

92
00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.870
Anyone wanna guess what nowrap does?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: It won't wrap.

93
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.570
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It doesn't wrap.

94
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.730
My gosh, can you believe it?

95
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.100
Yeah, they're all one after the other.

96
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.380
So actually the default value is row,
nowrap.

97
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:15.450
The default value is row nowrap,
and we have a way of writing that.

98
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:21.800
So, usually the way you see
this displayed in Flexbox is

99
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.480
you don't usually see the flex-direction
property and the flex-wrap property.

100
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.790
Usually, you see a property
that's called flex row.

101
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:33.330
And so that's point number four here,
the property is called flex flow.

102
00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.410
This is short-hand that combines
flex-direction with flex-wrap.

103
00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.469
So what we would do here is instead
of saying flex-direction of row and

104
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:49.541
flex-wrap of nowrap,
we would simply say flex-flow row, nowrap.

105
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.590
Those two things together
take the place of

106
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.510
the two things that we had
written out previously.

107
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.490
So that's the shorthand.
