00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.601
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Responsive design
consists of three characteristics,

2
00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:08.190
as defined by Ethan Marcot when he wrote
a fine article back in May of 2010.

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.430
Can anyone name what
the three characteristics,

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.530
the three defining characteristics
of responsive design include?

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.600
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Media queries.

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.483
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Media queries,

7
00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:17.900
definitely one of them.

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.690
What else?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Images that resize.

9
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.100
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Images that resize,

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.130
absolutely true.

11
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.825
And one more that's kind of
the heart of what we do today,

12
00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:32.029
hint hint.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Grid based layout.

13
00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.230
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A grid based layout.

14
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.070
You're not peeking on that
PowerPoint slide are you?

15
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.958
So this is it.

16
00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:42.681
So Ethan Marcotte, when he wrote his
definitive article on this back at

17
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:45.670
A List A Part,
this is how he defined responsive design.

18
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.200
Flexible grid based layout,
media queries, images that resize.

19
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.670
It's always worth revisiting this.

20
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.090
I am a Harvard professor,
I believe language matters.

21
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.880
This is what responsive design is,
it's not jQuery mobile or

22
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.670
something like that, [LAUGH] okay.

23
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.460
So this is what we mean when we
talk about responsive design.

24
00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.330
And so to go into detail
a little bit more about that,

25
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.010
we know that a grid based layout
consists of some number of columns,

26
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.930
which are projecting very badly
[LAUGH] on this particular slide.

27
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.860
But if you look a the PDF you
should be able to see the pink

28
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.670
bars that are behind this.

29
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.060
You can imagine up here on the top with
these 70 pixel boxes on the top row,

30
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.200
if they extended all the way down, you'll
see how we have a 12 column layout here.

31
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.014
You can combine these columns and

32
00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:35.197
create various different types
of layouts here on a page.

33
00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:38.684
This is probably super familiar to
all of you at this point, right?

34
00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:40.540
Great, okay.

35
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.660
Images that resize.

36
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.150
Images should change size based
on your screen resolution.

37
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.770
So if you are on a big desktop,
you should have a big image.

38
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.710
If you are on a phone,
what size image should you have?

39
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.510
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Very small.

40
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.940
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: A very small image

41
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.620
that downloads quickly and
doesn't consume your entire data plan.

42
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.480
So there are many ways of managing
images in a responsive manner.

43
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.510
Some of these are client side,
some of these are server side, and

44
00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.750
there's a new picture tag,
it's an HTML picture tag.

45
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.990
You guys familiar with
the HTML picture tag?

46
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.670
Brand new, HTML 5.1.

47
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.710
We are gonna be revisiting that today,
okay.

48
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.977
So this is actually got responsive
images built in to it, and

49
00:02:21.977 --> 00:02:25.515
we're gonna take a look in to that
in detail a little bit later on.

50
00:02:25.515 --> 00:02:28.070
All right, and
then of course we have media queries.

51
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.920
In media queries the browser
is reporting what is

52
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.920
basically our browser window size
at this particular point in time.

53
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.889
And then based on that width,
what portion of the style

54
00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.474
sheet is actually going to apply
to that portion of the screen.

55
00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:49.840
And obviously these are central to what we
are going to be doing for much of today.

56
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.450
There is no JavaScript involved.

57
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.049
This is one of the common confusions
that I find with a lot of people.

58
00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.570
JavaScript is not part of the whole
responsive design universe.

59
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.660
This is an add-on.

60
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.610
We occasionally add on JavaScript.

61
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.120
We add on polyfills, we add on various
types of interactivity, but the core of

62
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.830
responsive design, there is no JavaScript
required to it anywhere along the way.
