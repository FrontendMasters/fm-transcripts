00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.580
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: While we've got
this grid properties thing up.

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.400
Let's just take a quick pick at it,

3
00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.390
because I wanna point out a few items on
here that I have not gone over in class.

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.320
But just to sort of
make you aware of them.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.210
So, we'll start here at
the top of the page and

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.540
I'm gonna skip over a lot of this but
a few things to highlight.

7
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.080
So with the grid template rows and
the grid template columns,

8
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.820
those are two properties we
talked about quite a bit.

9
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.420
I wanted to point out just a few
things that maybe of use to you here.

10
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.310
So some people had mentioned
that they found that

11
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.900
the numbers were confusing when working
with grid columns and grid rows.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.760
I had you work with all
numbers all morning long.

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.060
But there's other methodologies
that you can use here.

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.180
So in my examples here and this is in
the text file here on line 13 or line 14.

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.460
Two things I want to point out to you.

16
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.430
So, in line 13 with
the grid template columns,

17
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.700
this is a way that you can
name your lines, okay?

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.780
So here I've named a line column one.

19
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.835
Which is gonna be 40 pixels wide and

20
00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:07.540
a name aligned column two
which is three fractions wide.

21
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.770
So two things to take away from that one,
this is how you indicate your names,

22
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.800
they're inside of square brackets
you can call them whatever you want.

23
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.020
And then the numbers that go next to
them will correspond to those widths.

24
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.880
The second thing that's incredibly cool
and I pointed this out a little bit

25
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.780
earlier as well,
is that the units can be widely different.

26
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.340
So in this case, we have 40 pixels and
three fractions.

27
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.190
So the way that this would work is that
the browser will set aside 40 pixels.

28
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.750
For that particular column and

29
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.870
then what ever is left over
divides into three fractions.

30
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.950
Depending on the screen width.

31
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.029
That is also a takeaway you can go with
for the rows, so, 50%, 25 VH auto.

32
00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:57.498
So, again, wildly different units
you can mix and match in that way.

33
00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:02.360
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: By the way,
you can use the repeat.

34
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.220
I showed you the repeat
syntax earlier today.

35
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.180
You can use that with the named grid lines
as well, but you want to be careful.

36
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.130
So here we have a repeat with a 2,
350 followed by a name.

37
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.810
And then a 10% outside of that.

38
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.560
So if you were to translate that,
that would go to 350 with

39
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.090
a name, 350 with the same name
because it's a repeat, right?

40
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.680
So you're naming it the same thing,

41
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.340
now you have two lines with
the same name followed by 10% which

42
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.680
didn't have any okay, so,
just some things to be aware of.

43
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.950
If you look at this and you say,
man, that looks really confusing,

44
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.640
stick with the numbers, I've already
showed you how to work with those.

45
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.390
So, this is just some alternative syntax
that you may encounter along the way

46
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.140
as you work with grid a little bit more.

47
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.268
Template areas is something
I'm gonna cover next, so

48
00:02:57.268 --> 00:02:58.804
I'm just gonna skip right over that.

49
00:03:02.692 --> 00:03:04.020
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'll point this out here.

50
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.325
So I'm done at line 51
in the text file and 55.

51
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:10.470
So line 55 I already
told you about grid-gap.

52
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.897
If you wanna call out grid-gap in
one direction only, lines 51 and

53
00:03:14.897 --> 00:03:19.940
52 you can call out the grid-column-gap or
the grid-row-gap, okay.

54
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.030
So, just the same properties.

55
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.390
Grid gap winds up being the shorthand.

56
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.100
Skip over a whole bunch of stuff again.

57
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.940
Now, I'm in the children portion of this,
the grid items.

58
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.410
We're taking a look at
lines 83 through 86-ish.

59
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.430
So far, to this point today,
we used the grid hyphen columns,

60
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.860
or grid hyphen rows,
followed by two numbers.

61
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.480
If you want to break that
down because again that is

62
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.530
actually a short hand that
have touch you initially.

63
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.940
There are some additional properties that
would call only one of those numbers so

64
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.120
grid current start grid column end.

65
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.960
So if you had grid-column:
one slash three.

66
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.370
You could write that out as grid column
start one, grid column end three.

67
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.860
That’s totally legitimate too.

68
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.450
To me, I like the shorthand because
I think it’s pretty clear and

69
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.850
that’s a whole lot of extra typing.

70
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.280
Likewise, there’s a grid row start and
a grid row end.

71
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.630
So you can do those.

72
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.980
Now somebody earlier today from
the internet mentioned the span

73
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.690
keyword and so forth.

74
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.290
And I have an example of that here.

75
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.810
So if you take a look
at line number 90 here.

76
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.710
Here is a class that has
a grid-column-start and a grid-column-end.

77
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.360
So we're gonna start at one and
then we end, quote, span four.

78
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.380
So the keyword of span four.

79
00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.840
So what would that
correspond to with numbers?

80
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.465
If I just said grid-column, what would be
the numbers that would come after that?

81
00:04:59.564 --> 00:05:04.401
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So these two lines here,
91 and 92, we have grid-column-start,

82
00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:09.475
we have grid-column-end, if we were
to rewrite this as grid hyphen column

83
00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:14.900
coolant what would be the two numbers that
would correspond to these two things?

84
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One slash five.

85
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.150
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One slash five.

86
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.140
So this is a way of saying start at one,
span over the next four lines.

87
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.870
Make sense, okay.

88
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.854
You can also, if you have names for

89
00:05:30.854 --> 00:05:33.671
your lines,
you can say span to that named line.

90
00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:38.221
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
you would've defined those names elsewhere

91
00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:39.320
in the document, right?

92
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.710
So again, this is just to make you aware
of some alternative syntax that's out

93
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.030
there and available you may encounter.

94
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.690
You can choose to use it,
you don't have to use it.

95
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.910
I've taught you the number type of thing,
okay.

96
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.090
And then the rest of that I'm
gonna skip over at this point.

97
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.360
So this is the portion of
grid that we covered so far.

98
00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.120
So it's about half of this document.

99
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.830
We're gonna cover most of
the rest of it at this point.
