WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So the next thing
we're gonna talk about, Grid area,

2
00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.882
the Grid template areas and
the Grid area syntax.

3
00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:09.180
Since I've got the document up, this is
actually a pretty easy way to explain it.

4
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.391
So far we have typically
used the Grid column and

5
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:18.864
the Grid row together in a single
declaration to declare where

6
00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:23.915
we want to have a certain area
of our web page designated,

7
00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:28.144
where that particular
grid item is going to be.

8
00:00:28.144 --> 00:00:32.919
A different way that you can do
this is actually using real names.

9
00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:38.201
So in this particular situation,
what we would do is we can have a series

10
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:42.881
of classes where we're gonna use
a property called grid area.

11
00:00:42.881 --> 00:00:47.589
And you give it a name and I have given
these particular classes, grid class one,

12
00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:48.500
two and three.

13
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.659
I gave them names like header article and

14
00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.989
aside because presumably that's the
function that they serve in the document.

15
00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.501
Obviously, you can call these
grid areas anything you want,

16
00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.599
any name you happen to want.

17
00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:04.465
So you can call them George,
Same and Mary if you prefer,

18
00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.985
although those tend not
to be a self documenting.

19
00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:11.902
And then down underneath here where
we have our wrapper which would be

20
00:01:11.902 --> 00:01:16.077
our grid container we can
declare our columns, our rows.

21
00:01:16.077 --> 00:01:19.642
And then we would declare
our grid template areas.

22
00:01:19.642 --> 00:01:24.238
So if you look at this,
what I have here is two rows.

23
00:01:24.238 --> 00:01:27.315
And the first row is,
header header header header.

24
00:01:27.315 --> 00:01:31.254
In other words,
since I declared four columns here,

25
00:01:31.254 --> 00:01:34.237
one fraction and three fractions wide.

26
00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:37.464
What I do here is I say,
header header header header.

27
00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:42.698
In other words, the header is gonna occupy
all four of those columns, make sense?

28
00:01:42.698 --> 00:01:46.051
Okay, and
then underneath I'm gonna have an aside.

29
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:49.998
The dot is an indicator to
skip that particular cell,

30
00:01:49.998 --> 00:01:55.188
to don't display anything there and
then have an article, article.

31
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.572
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So in this particular
situation those two articles will wind up

32
00:02:01.572 --> 00:02:03.663
being a container with that class too.

33
00:02:05.953 --> 00:02:07.765
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Makes sense?

34
00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:08.668
Sort of?

35
00:02:08.668 --> 00:02:10.828
Let's see it in action, okay.

36
00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:14.554
So this is sort of an overview of
the syntax we're gonna talk about next,

37
00:02:14.554 --> 00:02:15.971
this grid template areas.

38
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:17.446
So feel free to refer to that,

39
00:02:17.446 --> 00:02:21.523
you have your cheat sheet in front of you
people in class or in the document online.

40
00:02:23.612 --> 00:02:28.534
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so
if we take a look at, we're at chapter

41
00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:33.467
12 here in the documentation,
in the files.

42
00:02:33.467 --> 00:02:38.692
And in the begin folder we're gonna
open up grid area.css and gridarea.html.

43
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.757
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And these next few chapters
are really short and very simple,

44
00:02:45.757 --> 00:02:50.825
because I'm just demonstrating
different types of syntax here.

45
00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:57.608
So this probably looks familiar to you,
we actually had this example earlier.

46
00:02:57.608 --> 00:03:02.309
It changes around a little bit at the
various dimensions we saw that earlier.

47
00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:08.150
So I've taken that same example here and
you see we have the same kind of HTML.

48
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.043
So we have a div with the class of
wrapper, we have a header, an article, and

49
00:03:11.043 --> 00:03:11.644
then an aside.

50
00:03:11.644 --> 00:03:17.305
And then on our CSS,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We

51
00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:19.748
have some stuff already set up here.

52
00:03:19.748 --> 00:03:26.506
So this is the original grid syntax
that I used on this particular example.

53
00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.623
So we have our wrapper with our grid gap,
and

54
00:03:29.623 --> 00:03:35.109
then we have our various dimensions
called out as grid columns and grid rows.

55
00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.647
What we'd like to do now was rewrite
this using this grid area syntax.

56
00:03:40.647 --> 00:03:44.656
So I'm gonna go ahead and
write these with you.

57
00:03:47.814 --> 00:03:51.575
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So up here at the top with
the wrappers where we'll start which is

58
00:03:51.575 --> 00:03:55.000
our good container,
we're going to have the following.

59
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.469
So we're gonna have our
grid-template-columns,

60
00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:07.657
and we're gonna have
our grid-template-rows.

61
00:04:07.657 --> 00:04:12.388
And in fact, you can't,
of course call these out with however many

62
00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:16.381
numbers you want and
whatever dimensions you wanna use.

63
00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:19.875
You can also just say auto,
which is what I'm gonna do here.

64
00:04:19.875 --> 00:04:23.521
So hey grid, you figure it out.

65
00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:28.107
And then, here to our header,
our article and

66
00:04:28.107 --> 00:04:34.585
are aside we're going to add
an additional property value pair.

67
00:04:34.585 --> 00:04:39.554
So here under header,
we're going to add a grid area.

68
00:04:39.554 --> 00:04:44.663
Anybody wanna come up with a name for
what we should call our grade area?

69
00:04:48.321 --> 00:04:49.400
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about header?

70
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.151
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Not to confuse you,

71
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:54.997
of course.

72
00:04:54.997 --> 00:04:58.169
Just because I am using
the header selector on line 12,

73
00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.725
from the header HTML tag, does not mean
that I have to call the grid area, header,

74
00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:04.932
I could call it George, if I wanted to.

75
00:05:04.932 --> 00:05:11.007
But I'm gonna call it header, because
that's pretty self-documenting, likewise,

76
00:05:11.007 --> 00:05:16.280
here for the article I'm gonna give it
a grid area of, what should we call it?

77
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.150
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Article.

78
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.390
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Article, okay.

79
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.511
And for the aside I'm gonna
give it a grid area of?

80
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:24.789
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Aside.

81
00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:28.064
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Aside, okay.

82
00:05:28.064 --> 00:05:31.072
Actually I'll call this one sidebar,
just to throw you off.

83
00:05:31.072 --> 00:05:32.870
Sidebar, because I can,

84
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:37.214
[COUGH] just to show you that you
can call them different things.

85
00:05:37.214 --> 00:05:40.800
Okay, so
then to the wrapper up here on the top,

86
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.295
and where this is now working
at mobile dimensions, okay.

87
00:05:45.295 --> 00:05:49.939
Because we're outside of all of the media
queries and we're building mobile first.

88
00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:55.441
So this would be for
our mobile dimension to a wrapper class.

89
00:05:55.441 --> 00:06:00.634
We're gonna add grid-template-areas,

90
00:06:00.634 --> 00:06:06.673
and usually where I see
this written is as follows.

91
00:06:06.673 --> 00:06:11.399
So you write out that property
grid-template-areas: then usually the way

92
00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.732
I see this written is on the next line.

93
00:06:13.732 --> 00:06:17.999
In quotes we have "header",

94
00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:25.055
in quotes "article" and
in quotes "sidebar",

95
00:06:25.055 --> 00:06:29.667
with the semi-colon at the end.

96
00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:36.685
So this is telling grid that we're gonna
have, basically one row one column, right.

97
00:06:36.685 --> 00:06:39.913
We're just gonna stack these things on
top of each other at mobile dimensions.

98
00:06:39.913 --> 00:06:44.850
We're gonna have header, display first,
article, display second, side bar,

99
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.623
display last, makes sense?

100
00:06:46.623 --> 00:06:53.300
Cool, so if that makes sense,
then let's go to our media queries.

101
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.271
So here in our media query for 650 pixels,

102
00:06:57.271 --> 00:07:02.821
we can now erase all the stuff
that we put in here before, okay.

103
00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:06.489
This is definitely calling out where
we want these grid cells to go.

104
00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:09.908
But we're gonna call this out
now with different syntax so

105
00:07:09.908 --> 00:07:12.643
we can call this out
instead with the wrapper.

106
00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:20.548
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And
then we can say the following,

107
00:07:20.548 --> 00:07:25.108
grid-template-columns and

108
00:07:25.108 --> 00:07:30.024
grid-template-rows, okay.

109
00:07:30.024 --> 00:07:34.975
So in this case as you saw it displayed
on the page, we had a skinny column and

110
00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:36.874
we had a fat column, right.

111
00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:40.677
So for our columns we have two of
those but, they're different sizes.

112
00:07:40.677 --> 00:07:47.375
So I could call this 1fr and
3fr, make sense?

113
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:48.378
So one fraction and

114
00:07:48.378 --> 00:07:52.775
three fractions just divide the page into
four parts make the right one the fat one.

115
00:07:52.775 --> 00:07:57.314
Our grid template rows,
we can call this auto.

116
00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:01.134
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: However many rows it takes,
right?

117
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:11.728
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then we can try
our grid-template-areas becomes this.

118
00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:20.692
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Article article
article sidebar, right.

119
00:08:20.692 --> 00:08:24.766
So that'll be row 1, we're gonna have
three fractions being the articles so

120
00:08:24.766 --> 00:08:26.879
we repeat the word article three times.

121
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:31.419
Followed by the word sidebar to indicate
that that's our fourth fraction.

122
00:08:31.419 --> 00:08:36.624
And then under that the header
occupies the whole thing,

123
00:08:36.624 --> 00:08:41.077
"header header header header", make sense?

124
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:45.594
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then put
the semicolon on the end.

125
00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:49.938
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, so

126
00:08:49.938 --> 00:08:54.198
this is a totally different way
of writing exactly the same.

127
00:08:54.198 --> 00:08:57.955
The outcome is exactly the same as what
we had before with the grid columns and

128
00:08:57.955 --> 00:09:00.200
the grid rows and
all the different classes.

129
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.148
But this time we're doing this
using the grid area syntax.

130
00:09:04.148 --> 00:09:08.723
And we're specifying grid template
columns, grid template rows, and

131
00:09:08.723 --> 00:09:11.357
grid areas that go on the grid container.

132
00:09:11.357 --> 00:09:15.108
What questions do you have at this
point before we go into the desktop?

133
00:09:15.108 --> 00:09:16.570
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: For the grid template rows.

134
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:17.128
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

135
00:09:17.128 --> 00:09:18.013
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Is auto the default,

136
00:09:18.013 --> 00:09:21.123
so do you have to define that or can you
just leave it off and it would assume?

137
00:09:21.123 --> 00:09:23.700
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You could probably just
leave it off and it will be just fine.

138
00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.856
Yeah, but for sake of completeness
here I've left it on with auto.

139
00:09:27.856 --> 00:09:32.024
Other questions at this point in time?

140
00:09:32.024 --> 00:09:36.072
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: What are the limitations
of the names of grid areas,

141
00:09:36.072 --> 00:09:38.746
can I use hyphens or underscores?

142
00:09:38.746 --> 00:09:43.568
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So far as I am aware,
you can use whatever is legal

143
00:09:43.568 --> 00:09:47.579
in CSS is legal here for grid area names.
