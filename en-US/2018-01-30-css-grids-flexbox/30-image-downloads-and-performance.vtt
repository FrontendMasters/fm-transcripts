00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.070
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Then we come to my
favorite part of all of this which

2
00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.510
is the background images.

3
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.750
And the place to get this
URL is in the instructions.

4
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.786
And there is a URL here from Tim Kadlec in
the very last line of the instructions.

5
00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:20.700
And I'm gonna pull up this page because
I think this is just totally cool stuff.

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.008
And I wish, Tim, if you're out there
watching, please update your article.

7
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:26.290
This would be awesome.

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.300
So this is actually from five and
a half years ago.

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.970
And I haven't found anybody else
who has done this kind of work.

10
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.180
But this is really interesting stuff.

11
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.093
So the question Tim Kadlec asked was what
happens with various types of HTML and

12
00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:44.147
CSS, which images actually download?

13
00:00:44.147 --> 00:00:47.739
So as an example here, here's test one.

14
00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.604
So if I have a div with an ID of test one,
and an image tag inside of that,

15
00:00:52.604 --> 00:00:56.894
and I write a media query that
says don't display test one, so

16
00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:02.256
test one is display none, so we're not
displaying the div around the image,

17
00:01:02.256 --> 00:01:04.760
does the image actually download?

18
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.110
And so he ran that test.

19
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.538
And, shockingly, the image did,
in fact, download, okay,

20
00:01:10.538 --> 00:01:13.820
which is actually the answer
you would expect.

21
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.200
And he has a whole series of these tests.

22
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.250
So if it was a background image, and

23
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.050
we said display none at some point
in time, would the image download?

24
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.100
So there's a whole bunch of these.

25
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.860
And I would encourage you to spend
some time with this article cuz

26
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.500
it's really interesting reading
about what images download where.

27
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.040
And, again,
I apologize that it's a dated reference.

28
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.310
But I haven't found anybody
else who has updated this.

29
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.251
And if somebody out there knows,
I'd love to hear about it

30
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:46.443
because I think this is a really
valuable teaching reference.

31
00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:52.952
But the one I'm gonna scroll down
to here is test number five.

32
00:01:52.952 --> 00:01:53.940
I think the one that I want.

33
00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.416
Yes, so test number five is this.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Actually,

34
00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:04.150
we'll start with test number four.

35
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.240
So here's test number four.

36
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.374
Let's think about these as
background images, okay.

37
00:02:08.374 --> 00:02:10.535
So our HTML is super simple.

38
00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:14.440
It's just a div with an ID of test four,
okay.

39
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.769
And in our CSS, outside the media query,
we download one image, okay.

40
00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.179
And inside the media query,

41
00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:24.400
we download a second image.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

42
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.870
how many images download?

43
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.790
And the answer is some browsers
are downloading both of them, okay.

44
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.923
So the best way to deal with
a background image is actually with test

45
00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:38.976
number five here.

46
00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.940
And in test number five,
it's the same HTML.

47
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.180
But we're gonna have two
different media queries.

48
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.770
And we put our background image
inside those media queries.

49
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.055
If we do that, then basically
the browsers downloaded a single image,

50
00:02:54.055 --> 00:02:57.990
whatever the appropriate sized image is.

51
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.550
Make sense?

52
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.280
Okay, so this is really important for
performance.

53
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.960
We know we're downloading only one image.

54
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.545
Again, they're older browsers but,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We're gonna take past

55
00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.030
results as an indication
of future performance.
