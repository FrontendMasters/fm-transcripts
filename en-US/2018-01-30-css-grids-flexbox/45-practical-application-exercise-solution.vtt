00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.980
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There is probably several
solutions to this particular issue.

2
00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.980
You're more than welcome
to do something different.

3
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:06.622
If it works,

4
00:00:06.622 --> 00:00:10.100
then that's the ultimate arbitrator as
to whether something is good or not.

5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.210
I tend towards the more efficient
solution, but you can do what you want.

6
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.600
If it works, it works.

7
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.120
Hopefully you got most of those
classes and numbers pretty easily.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.860
If you didn't,
please ask a question in the chat, or

9
00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.650
of course, if you're here in
the classroom, ask a question.

10
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.140
But down here when we get to the last row,
which is all of the R5 classes,

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.460
what I wound up having to do here was
talk about what row things were on.

12
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.766
And this is what helps me in the desktop
versus the mobile layouts here.

13
00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:49.929
So I added to this a grid row of five,
six for

14
00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.800
the desktop and
that helped with the reordering.

15
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.440
When we go back up to the mobile,
sort of the tablet's media query here.

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.520
Notice that I have the first and
last columns are on the very last row,

17
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.770
row eight, nine and
the middle item is on row seven, eight.

18
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.400
Make sense?

19
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.610
Okay, so I'm having to dictate things

20
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.795
in that row dimension in
addition to the column dimension.

21
00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:28.850
And then up here in mobile I don't think I
actually have much of anything going on.

22
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.090
I haven't said where anything
is supposed to display and

23
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.330
that seems to be working in mobile.

24
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.570
All right, so
how did things work out for you?

25
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.900
Good?

26
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.440
Everything all right?

27
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.175
Any comments?

28
00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:45.606
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I used nth-child selectors-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Sweet.

29
00:01:45.606 --> 00:01:49.869
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Instead of,
the RCC3 kinda breaks down when

30
00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.550
you're on various form factors-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It is true.

31
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.380
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: At various widths.

32
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.030
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah.

33
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.270
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so

34
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.480
you were using nth-child
as your selector instead.

35
00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah, and
then I have a question-

36
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.240
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: That's great.

37
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.854
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: About
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: About the use of the grid

38
00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:06.090
row, versus the order property.

39
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.250
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, yeah.

40
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.280
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Do you
prefer one over the other?

41
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.140
Is-
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so

42
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.900
order is also an option.

43
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.170
And sort of leads into one of the other
things I was going to mention here.

44
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.800
If you were with me yesterday,

45
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.660
you remember I gave you
a cheat sheet on FlexBox.

46
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.650
Those of you who are here in the classroom
with me have a printout of this.

47
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.950
If you're online,
if you go into your Chapter Eight folder,

48
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.940
there's a file in there
called gridproperties.txt.

49
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.781
And it is a cheat sheet of
many of these grid properties,

50
00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:38.953
which some people have alluded to today
that I haven't necessarily said anything

51
00:02:38.953 --> 00:02:40.410
about to this point in time.

52
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.750
So the question here has to do with order.

53
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.240
Which is I think was the one that I
wound up not putting on the sheet.

54
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.970
But order, basically is,
works like the FlexBox order property

55
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.070
in that we can reorder
our grid cells in space.

56
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.420
But, If you're doing
something complicated like

57
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.620
completely moving them around
from one location to another,

58
00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.020
I think you're gonna find that the order
property doesn't necessarily do it.

59
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.980
By default, all of the boxes
have an order value of one,

60
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.630
if I remember correctly, or zero, yeah.

61
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.512
But it's all the same.

62
00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:20.530
So as soon as you assign an order number,

63
00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.640
then that particular item, grid item,
will move to the end, whatever the end is.

64
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.570
And so my sense is that it may work

65
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.620
well if you're doing a simple movement,
like just on a row or just on a column.

66
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.340
But it's probably,
I think it might cause more confusion.

67
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.970
At least, certainly at this point,
as we're just learning grid.

68
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.640
But there's nothing wrong with it.

69
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.370
It's a thing.

70
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.160
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Okay, perfect.

71
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.435
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's a thing,
it's a legitimate thing.

72
00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:48.935
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Thank you.
