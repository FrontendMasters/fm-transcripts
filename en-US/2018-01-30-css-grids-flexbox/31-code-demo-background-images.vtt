00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.530
&gt;&gt; Jen: So let's go ahead and try doing
something similar in our html and css.

2
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.620
We have here on the page on line 14,
we have div class of background image,

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.030
and the in our css, actually we don't
have any css, we'll make some css.

4
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.048
I'm gonna make a new file
[COUGH] I'm gonna call

5
00:00:24.048 --> 00:00:29.590
it style.css,
cuz I'm super original that way.

6
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.997
I'm gonna link that
style.css file up to my

7
00:00:34.997 --> 00:00:40.445
HTML.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Sorry, link.

8
00:00:42.952 --> 00:00:49.884
&gt;&gt; Jen: href="style.css rel="stylesheet"

9
00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:57.961
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, and then in the stylesheet

10
00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:02.439
what I'm gonna do is, I'll go ahead and

11
00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:09.190
write a series of media queries for
this is what I can do.

12
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.004
So I can say, for example, @media,

13
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.261
&gt;&gt; Jen: (min-width: 1px)

14
00:01:22.755 --> 00:01:24.410
&gt;&gt; Jen: It's at least one pixel wide.

15
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.441
You can stir this, so
my class of background image.

16
00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.457
&gt;&gt; Jen: Background url and I have here in

17
00:01:36.457 --> 00:01:43.170
my image folder, I have three
different versions of a mom pie.

18
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.900
Okay, so small, medium, and large.

19
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:54.397
So I can display that image.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Oops, JPEG.

20
00:01:54.397 --> 00:01:58.100
No repeat and you probably want to set

21
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.791
a height.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Why do we set a height?

22
00:02:06.774 --> 00:02:08.259
&gt;&gt; Jen: Normally, we never set a height.

23
00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:17.730
Why would we set a height here?
&gt;&gt; Jen: That's our HTML.

24
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.180
That one line, there on line 15.

25
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.450
Here in our style,
we're gonna set a height.

26
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.040
Why would I set a height here?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: So

27
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.511
it shows up
&gt;&gt; Jen: So

28
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:29.866
it actually shows up.
&gt;&gt; Jen: How is height normally determined

29
00:02:29.866 --> 00:02:34.861
in a box?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: By what fills it.

30
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:35.977
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah, by what fills it,

31
00:02:35.977 --> 00:02:38.470
its content,
content determines the height.

32
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.320
If you have no content on a div,
you have nothing to fill it, so

33
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.040
you gotta have a height.

34
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.605
Where do I get the height from?
&gt;&gt; Jen: I

35
00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.799
can probably just look at the image,
right?

36
00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.333
Just look at the image and
figure out what its height is,

37
00:02:56.333 --> 00:03:00.540
okay?
&gt;&gt; Jen: Y'all going

38
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.426
to sleep already?
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, so now,

39
00:03:05.426 --> 00:03:09.792
if I have a minimum width of,
let's say, 500 pixels,

40
00:03:09.792 --> 00:03:13.640
then we'll go ahead and
load the different image.

41
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.418
The one that's 767 pixels in size, and

42
00:03:18.418 --> 00:03:24.030
its height is 128 pixels.
&gt;&gt; Jen: And

43
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.350
then, finally, I can have a third
media query for the big screen.

44
00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:40.253
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, so there we go, three little

45
00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:45.766
mini queries and when I refresh my
webpage, we should see only one image.

46
00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:52.048
&gt;&gt; Jen: I need to re-display my image,

47
00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:56.691
okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen: There we go.

48
00:03:56.691 --> 00:03:59.980
All right, so there's my background
image up here on the top, and

49
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.032
there's my peace pie.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay, so

50
00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:10.328
there's my one image.
&gt;&gt; Jen: There it is.

51
00:04:10.328 --> 00:04:17.740
Scootching to the smaller size and
I must have a stray tag somewhere.

52
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.172
Something's not behaving but
hopefully it worked for

53
00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:28.936
you.
&gt;&gt; Jen: How are you doing?

54
00:04:28.936 --> 00:04:31.542
Besides exhaustion.

55
00:04:31.542 --> 00:04:34.630
[INAUDIBLE] Good, all right.

56
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.057
Do we have any questions
from the internet?

57
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: IE support.

58
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.980
I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Jen: IE support for

59
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.580
picture fill, or?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Yeah I'm assuming it

60
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.910
works.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Yeah.

61
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.440
So, the picture tag doesn't work in IE.

62
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.050
Big surprise, it's HTML 5.1.

63
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.260
It maybe spotty support for

64
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.150
older browsers but that's what
the picture fill, polyfill is all about.

65
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.380
So if you include the picture
fill polyfill with it

66
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.770
then you are making things
forward to compatible.

67
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.420
I know a lot of you are writing code bases
that are around for a really long time.

68
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.570
It's probably worth using
this particular polyfill,

69
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.900
because then you can use the actual
picture tag in your code.

70
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.530
And then at some point in time
in the future you can just drop

71
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.700
the polyfill, right?

72
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.940
You still have standards compliant HTML.

73
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.220
Which eventually someday will
be rid of Internet Explorer or

74
00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.520
I've heard of all rainbows and
unicorns and ponies.

75
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.200
It's gonna be a great world to live in,
but until then the polyphill

76
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.260
is maybe useful, again depending on
what kind of browsers you got to support
