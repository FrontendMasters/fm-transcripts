00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.750
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: One last thing
that I'd like to add to this.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.450
I'd like to add the ability
to reorder a row.

3
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.518
So what if I wanted to take this,
let's say this first row here,

4
00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:15.983
which is currently Boston cream pie,
coconut cream pie and key lime pie,

5
00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.883
pumpkin pie, basically alphabetical order.

6
00:00:18.883 --> 00:00:22.605
What if I wanted to reverse
the order of those,

7
00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:28.080
and have pumpkin pie first,
and Boston cream pie last?

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.550
Is there a way I can do that?

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.450
There's actually two
approaches you could use.

10
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.820
Does anybody have any suggestions?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Row

11
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.050
reverse
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

12
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.760
row reverse would be
one possible solution.

13
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.530
And what would be the other possible

14
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.350
solution?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Order.

15
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.330
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Order on each

16
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:45.770
individual cell.

17
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.078
Which is better?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Row reverse.

18
00:00:48.078 --> 00:00:50.181
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It depends.

19
00:00:50.181 --> 00:00:56.960
[LAUGH] It depends, your $1000,
zillion dollar consulting phrase.

20
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.740
So if we really,

21
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.800
truly do wanna just reverse it from
the current order to the reverse order,

22
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.550
we can do it pretty simply with a single
class just using row reverse, right?

23
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.430
Or, we could use four different
classes to reorder it, right?

24
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.170
So it just sort of depends on what
you're doing with your code and

25
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.230
ultimately the layout that you're gonna
have at various break points as to

26
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.910
which will be the better way to go.

27
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.830
So, since we've done stuff with order,

28
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.660
let's try to write a class then that
will go ahead and reverse that row.

29
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.090
So let's go on head and do that.

30
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.430
Let's make this class just for
desktop only.

31
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.280
So what might

32
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.460
I call this particular class?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Reverse.

33
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.640
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Call the class reverse,

34
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.950
because that's what it does.

35
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.250
Great idea.

36
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.714
And then what would be the property value
pair that I would put in here for reverse?

37
00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:55.620
Anyone have any suggestions?

38
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.440
Look at your cheat sheets.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Look at that cheat sheet,

39
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.810
what would I put in?

40
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.609
Anybody, but Peter.
&gt;&gt; off screen: Flex-direction?

41
00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:08.530
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Flex-direction,

42
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.985
flex hyphen direction, and
this time we're going to say what?

43
00:02:12.985 --> 00:02:17.960
Row reverse
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

44
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.009
and then where would I apply
this particular class in my

45
00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:28.917
HTML?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Where would

46
00:02:28.917 --> 00:02:31.900
I apply the reverse class in my HTML?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Be on the row.

47
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.430
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It would be on the row,

48
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.120
correct, right.

49
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.900
Because it's a parent, as you see here
on your cheat sheet, it is a parent

50
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.077
property not a child property, so
it will go on the parent here.

51
00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:48.791
So reverse, and if we did that,
and we refresh our page,

52
00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:52.490
hopefully we would see the reverse.

53
00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.755
Did it worked, did I save everything?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Too small for

54
00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:04.842
me to see.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It helps if you put it on

55
00:03:04.842 --> 00:03:07.020
the correct row, sorry.

56
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.880
Row 1, reverse.

57
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.980
I put it on row five and expected row one
to change, shockingly, that did not work.

58
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.440
Okay, so let's refresh.

59
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.030
There we go.

60
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.230
We have an interesting
problem going on here.

61
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.224
Does anyone see the problem?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Shifted.

62
00:03:24.224 --> 00:03:28.870
Alignment.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, look at this.

63
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.619
Are you designers happy?

64
00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.100
No?

65
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.240
What could we do to fix this?

66
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.290
What should we do to fix this problem?
&gt;&gt; off screen: Justify content?

67
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:43.320
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: We could justify

68
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.280
the content, but
what is causing this problem?

69
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.055
What causes this problem up here?
&gt;&gt; off screen: A margin

70
00:03:55.055 --> 00:03:57.630
being overridden.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so

71
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.090
we put the margin on the left, correct?

72
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:08.210
So the margin's on the left.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Twice.

73
00:04:11.128 --> 00:04:16.073
Okay so what we can do here then is in our

74
00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:19.938
CSS we can say this, margin,

75
00:04:19.938 --> 00:04:25.040
hyphen left is zero, margin-right is

76
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.244
4%
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Now

77
00:04:30.244 --> 00:04:33.370
when we refresh it's still not working.

78
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.610
[COUGH] Let's see what did I do?

79
00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:38.690
I did this.

80
00:04:41.473 --> 00:04:48.712
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: [class*= 'col-1'].

81
00:04:52.966 --> 00:04:54.557
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: There we go.

82
00:04:54.557 --> 00:04:59.880
Okay, so remember that the margin's
actually on the item, right?

83
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.340
That's what's going on here.

84
00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:09.120
So if you go up here at the top,
the row is what we have to reorder, right?

85
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.120
But the margin is actually
associated with the individual item.

86
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.080
So what we've done here then is,
and actually,

87
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.430
we should probably break that
into two classes shouldn't we?

88
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.240
Which should have a reverse class,
which is that cuz that's the parent.

89
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.210
And then we should say reverse this thing.

90
00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:41.273
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Makes sense?

91
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.530
So there's the parent, we reverse
the parent, and then we are gonna

92
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.320
change around the margin on the two
children to make that work, right?

93
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.230
So if you save that and then refresh
the back, now it's gonna work.

94
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.730
There we go.
