00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.639
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Let me just do
a quick search for Picturefill,

2
00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.003
visit the project site.

3
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:04.808
Here we go.

4
00:00:04.808 --> 00:00:09.168
Okay, so this is scottjehl.github.io.

5
00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:12.746
So S-C-O-T-T-J-E-H-L,

6
00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:17.559
scottjehl.github.io/picturefill and so

7
00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.760
this is the responsive image polyfill.

8
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.632
So he wrote this originally and has
updated it regularly through the years to

9
00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:29.842
make sure that it's in
sync with the picture tag.

10
00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:33.805
And one day,
we won't need the polyfill anymore but

11
00:00:33.805 --> 00:00:39.941
the purpose of this polyfill is to make
the picture tab work with older browsers.

12
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:45.894
So the way to make this work is
you can download the polyfill,

13
00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:51.513
I would recommend downloading
picturefill.min.js.

14
00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:56.430
If you don't wanna download it, I've
already given it to you in the end folder.

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.221
So you have picture fields
available to you there and

16
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:04.925
you can copy that into your begin folder,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

17
00:01:04.925 --> 00:01:08.754
then,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It will go ahead and

18
00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:11.191
tell you exactly how about
to go about doing this.

19
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:16.007
So the first thing to do is it says
to put this little line of code,

20
00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:22.670
which calls the JavaScript file, put it in
the head section of your HTML document.

21
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.100
So unlike a lot of JavaScript these days
that we put down just before the body tag,

22
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.810
this is required to make
the page display so

23
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.130
it's gonna be better placed
in the head of the document.

24
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.747
So go on ahead and paste that in.

25
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.490
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And this will be min.js.

26
00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.909
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and then,
if you need it even more cross-browser

27
00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.309
compatible, like the browser doesn't even
know what the picture tag is, then there

28
00:01:56.309 --> 00:02:01.340
is this little bit of html that you can
copy right here in the recommended usage.

29
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.679
You don't have to copy the head tags, but
copy everything or most everything else.

30
00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.856
I'm actually gonna copy the first
script tag, and that will be

31
00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:18.921
a little bit of JavaScript that tells
the browser what the picture tag is.

32
00:02:21.385 --> 00:02:24.125
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Simple enough that
I even understand this JavaScript.

33
00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:27.757
Look, document.create
a thing called picture.

34
00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:32.497
So that's what it's doing,
it creates a picture HTML tag.

35
00:02:32.497 --> 00:02:36.716
And then the picturefill JavaScript will
actually tell it what to do with it.

36
00:02:40.007 --> 00:02:43.516
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And then at that point,
that's pretty much all you need to do.

37
00:02:43.516 --> 00:02:47.889
Look there's the URL that I
was looking for right there.

38
00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:54.204
Line 13, so
now I've added the polyfill to this.

39
00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:58.445
There's nothing I needed to tweak in the
HTML because this is the HTML the way it's

40
00:02:58.445 --> 00:03:02.518
supposed to work and the polyfill is
just making it cross browser compatible.

41
00:03:02.518 --> 00:03:05.370
Make sense, sweet.

42
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.880
Feel free to take take your time and

43
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.170
read through all of the things
that he talks about in here.

44
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.379
I've use picturefill in a very simple way.

45
00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.394
Picturefill is able to accommodate
things like retina images and

46
00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:21.100
all kinds of other variations and
so forth.

47
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.920
There's a lot of stuff here,
have fun reading through all of it.

48
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.140
But I've showed you the simplest
way to work with it, make sense?

49
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:32.390
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: There is
a comment on the picture.

50
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.364
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.

51
00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:36.767
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: The best part about picture
is that you can load multiple image

52
00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:37.360
formats.

53
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.072
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: You provide a WebP version

54
00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:45.843
in the tag and Chrome automatically
will use instead of jpeg, png.

55
00:03:45.843 --> 00:03:48.750
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so yes,
that is absolutely true.

56
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.810
You can use different image formats.

57
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.417
The fact that I used all jpegs here
appropriate to the picture that I'm using.

58
00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:58.339
But if you wanted to mix up
whatever gifs and pngs and WebP and

59
00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.486
all the rest of it,
you can do that crazy stuff.
