00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.140
&gt;&gt; Jen: So the very end of this

2
00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.100
is we're up to the very last
chapter here for the course.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.370
And this is chapter
eighteen called practice.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.760
So I'm just gonna tell you
what the practice here was.

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.990
So, what we've got here is,

6
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.010
take a look at the last two
days of work that you've done.

7
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.100
You've done a ton of work on
this pie in the sky website.

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.750
So, what I would ask you to do is to
finish building the remaining pages.

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.450
So you're gonna take your nav bar,
you're gonna link all your pages together.

10
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.500
Think about the appropriate
use of flex box and

11
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.610
grid to complete those page layouts.

12
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.140
What should be grid and where?

13
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.440
What should be flex box and where?

14
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.640
And then, you could also try cutting
a contact form or a pie ordering form.

15
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.480
I haven't talked about forms at all in
this class but you could think about forms

16
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.940
and layout with that.

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.080
And I have not given you anything
in the begin folder for this.

18
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.230
Because your first job is to think about
all of the stuff you have done over

19
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.410
the last two days.

20
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.620
So if you go back and revisit the end
folders from the last two days you can

21
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.380
pull out various elements and
start to put things together.

22
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.550
Now, the people here in
the classroom look really tired.

23
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.850
It's pretty common, come 3 o'clock in
the afternoon for people to kinda go,

24
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.530
I'm done for the day.

25
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.910
We've covered an enormous amount of
content in a very short period of time.

26
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:28.250
And so, what I'm gonna do now is show you
my answers to this particular problem.

27
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.053
So I'll go ahead and
display this in a browser and

28
00:01:32.053 --> 00:01:35.174
show you what that looks like.
&gt;&gt; Jen: So

29
00:01:35.174 --> 00:01:37.970
is the same looking kind of homepage.

30
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.260
I've recoded it with grid.

31
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.600
So you saw this before with flex box and

32
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.010
as I start to narrow it down,
watch that background image.

33
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.990
And you see that I do have it coded to
go to a smaller background image in

34
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.060
smaller dimensions, okay?

35
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.850
So that works pretty much the same way.

36
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.030
The gallery page you already saw,
the history page you already saw.

37
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.199
So the new pages that I added,
I added a menu page here.

38
00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.040
So here we have pies by the slice,
we have ala mode,

39
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.670
we have mini pies, whole pies,
specialty pies okay?

40
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.150
So there's some of that.

41
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.610
We have a catering page, so

42
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.620
there's the catering page that's
just some extra content there.

43
00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.050
And then the contact I did
do a pie ordering form here.

44
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.110
So this is some basic
contact information here,

45
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.940
I am making use HTML 5 form fields.

46
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.170
If you are not familiar with those, that's
a really great topic for you to look into,

47
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.390
because these HTML5 form fields
include things like the email field,

48
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.870
the phone number field.

49
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.440
There's a date field that's really
badly cross browser compatible, but

50
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.440
the phone number and
the email are pretty good.

51
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.850
And so these are really helpful,
particularly on phones.

52
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.630
If you're not familiar with those,
they will actually,

53
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.860
on your phone,
they will change the keyboard layout.

54
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.190
So for example, if you're doing the phone
number field on a form, you'll actually

55
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.490
have numbers on your key pad on the phone,
so you can like type in a number.

56
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.330
Instead of calling them all text,
in which case you

57
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.680
have to flip over to the numbers and
then figure out where the numbers are.

58
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.220
The email,
it may depend on you whether have IOS or

59
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.390
whether you have android, the email would
give you an @ sign on the full screen.

60
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.870
A little things like that,

61
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.630
that just make entering this kind
of information a little bit easier.

62
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.744
So, you might wanna look into those
might be good opportunity to do that.

63
00:03:40.744 --> 00:03:44.990
I'm gonna use of the number field here for
your pies.

64
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.840
Of course we have some radio button
kind of things and special request.

65
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.400
The form doesn't submit anywhere.

66
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.900
It's just your basic form here and

67
00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.050
obviously that's well beyond
the scope of the course.

68
00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.060
You can hook it up to whatever sort of
processing scripts you wanted to do.

69
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.369
All right, so let's take a quick peek at
what the HTML on all those looks like.

70
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.700
Notably, let's look at the contact form,
so

71
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.820
here on the contact form you'll see that I
have added here, there's the navigation.

72
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.020
So all of my pages link together,
then here in my pie ordering form,

73
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.130
so we've got my div class of content,
we've got my article.

74
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.780
And then I've got various field sets that
group these bits of content together.

75
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.380
The field sets are really helpful for
accessibility purposes.

76
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.080
So we have here field set
with a class of contact.

77
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.350
In other words this is all
the contact information.

78
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.590
So you'll see here we have text, the phone
field, the email field the date field.

79
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.830
As I said, the date feels pretty dodgy in
terms of it's cross browser compatibility,

80
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.830
not really that hot.

81
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.290
You really don't know what you're
getting with the date field, but

82
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.045
it seems to still, even if somebody
can just type in information,

83
00:04:58.045 --> 00:05:00.730
it seems to be okay, at least for that.

84
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.570
Then we have our next field set which
is the information about the pie.

85
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.130
So that's what that field
set was all about and

86
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.750
then so
if you made use of the number field.

87
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.840
Here we have some information here
with some radio buttons, right?

88
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.060
Your basic radio buttons.

89
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.850
Notice we're making use
of the label tags here.

90
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.540
The label tags are responsible for
associating the words.

91
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.860
Like, classic full crust with
the previous radio button.

92
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.480
What this does, in terms of accessibility,
it's really important because the actual

93
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.670
words that are the translations for the
radio button are now associated together.

94
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.730
But this is also a helpful way
of coding this on a phone,

95
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.420
where you got nice fat fingers and

96
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.820
you try to click a tiny radio button and
maybe you actually get the words instead.

97
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:50.500
The words become clickable when you
code them up with labels in this way.

98
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.130
So this is a really

99
00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.670
good technique to use if you are not
familiar with the label tag.

100
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.920
A super helpful thing.

101
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.730
I made use of a data list here.

102
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:05.570
Data lists are also a relatively
new thing in HTML 5 and

103
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.960
what the data list will do is you
can start to type in something,

104
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.650
and if it's in the list,
it will come up as an option.

105
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.130
So you can start to type in like Apple,
if Apple's on the list,

106
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.780
it will come up as an option.

107
00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.690
So it works kind of like
a Google search box.

108
00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.870
If it's not supported in the web browser,

109
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.410
then this works as
a standard select drop down.

110
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.600
So you can just choose
something from the list.

111
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.720
So data list is kind of cool.
&gt;&gt; Jen: And then we wrap up

112
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.750
with kinda standard stuff,
the text area and so forth.

113
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.020
And then we've got our testimonials, and
then we have our footer at the bottom.

114
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.980
So that's all of that HTML.

115
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:53.590
If we take a look at our CSS.
&gt;&gt; Jen: So our CSS kinda looks like this.

116
00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.370
A few things that I've added along the
way, because I don't have rows anymore and

117
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:07.020
I have padding or margin on my rows,
I've added some more here on my headings.

118
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.873
I've had to rearrange where
some of the padding and

119
00:07:09.873 --> 00:07:13.533
margins are along the way to make
things to continue to look good.

120
00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:20.276
&gt;&gt; Jen: So I'm continuing in my habit here

121
00:07:20.276 --> 00:07:25.750
of adding other classes that wrap
around that main content area.

122
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.190
So I called it content for the most part,
but I have a special one for gallery.

123
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.750
The home page has a different
layout altogether.

124
00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:36.550
But all of those keep the same types of
properties in terms of background colors

125
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.140
and border radiuses and paddings.

126
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.440
So that's all there.

127
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.175
Image gallery, we have our floats,

128
00:07:45.175 --> 00:07:50.026
we have our sidebars.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Okay so

129
00:07:50.026 --> 00:07:53.150
then I have some form
styling that's going on here.

130
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.320
You can turn off the border
in the field set.

131
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.740
I know the field set by default is
a fairly ugly thing to look at.

132
00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.880
So, if you turn off the border here,
give it a little bit of,

133
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.210
zero out your padding in your margin,
make it display black.

134
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.430
Then you do have the accessibility,
features are all present but

135
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.140
you don't have any of the ugliness
that comes with it out of the box.

136
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.760
You can see here,
I'm mostly doing some basic styling.

137
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:22.848
In terms of colors and so forth.
&gt;&gt; Jen: But

138
00:08:22.848 --> 00:08:27.990
the way that I set this up, for the most
part, these are just the form fields.

139
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.090
And the words are on
top of the form fields,

140
00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:32.100
they're stacked on top of each other.

141
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.050
I didn't take the time to put these
side-by-side, so you have the words next

142
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:39.590
to the form field, and then maybe they
stack on top of each other on mobile.

143
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.630
That is of course something you
could totally do with grid and

144
00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.710
so that might be something that
you would wanna check into.

145
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:52.370
My personal feeling on this these days
is that, and this is my own preference,

146
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.020
that putting things next to each other
like that can get to be awkward.

147
00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.840
I prefer them stacked, I think
the look of the form is cleaner and

148
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.160
I think it's potentially
more usable as well.

149
00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.402
So that tends to be what I
do with forms these days.

150
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:09.984
&gt;&gt; Jen: Notice that I'm making use

151
00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:14.620
of attribute selectors here to select
my radio buttons and my check boxes.

152
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:19.110
So that's a cool thing, if the attribute
selector was new to you in this course,

153
00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.240
this is a nice use for

154
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.500
that because of course these
are all inputs in form fields.

155
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.530
Now you can differentiate
your radio buttons and

156
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:29.300
your check boxes via an attribute
selector, so that's kinda cool.

157
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:38.504
And let's see we have some button styling.
&gt;&gt; Jen: Let's see,

158
00:09:38.504 --> 00:09:40.840
so I had a nested grid in some cases.

159
00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:45.580
So the content page and
the homepage wind up with a nested grid.

160
00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.380
So that's why those classes were there.

161
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.519
The boxes on the homepage are displayed
pretty simply, like this.

162
00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:00.050
Okay and than finally on
the desk top down, once again.

163
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:03.080
So you've seen all these
tricks during the day here,

164
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.620
where I'm changing around
the numbers of columns.

165
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.490
Changing around the grid
gap potentially and

166
00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:11.830
breaking things down here
between the media queries.

167
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.750
So I don't think there is anything new
in terms of grid that I've done here.

168
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.630
But I'm applying it to all
of these different pages.

169
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:22.450
Sometimes I may be using
separate classes for doing that

170
00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:27.130
because in the case of the gallery
class we're dealing with Flexbox later.

171
00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:31.220
In the case of the content class we have
one kind of layout, in the case of a home

172
00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.680
class we'll have a different kind
of layout later, makes sense?

173
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.630
Okay, so if you have some time and
you want some extra practice.

174
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.550
I would strongly encourage you to go
on ahead try this last chapter here,

175
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.340
the practice chapter.

176
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.330
You can go ahead and
build out the rest of the website.

177
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.240
As I've said before, you do have
a branding folder available to you

178
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.870
inside of the whole repository
that you downloaded.

179
00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:01.200
And there are tons of images inside of
that, background images and so forth.

180
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.980
There are font specifications,
there's logos, and there's

181
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.630
a Word document with all kinds of copy on
it for different pages that you could add.

182
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:14.620
So this would give you a lot of extra
practice in terms of working with grid.
