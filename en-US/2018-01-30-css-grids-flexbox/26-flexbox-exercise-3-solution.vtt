WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.640
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so it's so
short, let's just go ahead and

2
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.550
code this together.

3
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.630
So let's go ahead and start here.

4
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.350
First of all,

5
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.860
I didn't make any changes to my HTML,
I worked with it exactly as it is, okay?

6
00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.620
And I just used very simple selectors for
selecting things on the page here.

7
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.919
So let's start by identifying
what is our flex container and

8
00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:25.698
what are our flex items.

9
00:00:25.698 --> 00:00:28.624
So which tag is our flex container, tag or

10
00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:30.860
tags?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Ul.

11
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.893
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The ul,

12
00:00:31.893 --> 00:00:35.591
the ul is our flex container.

13
00:00:35.591 --> 00:00:40.572
What then are our flex items?

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.230
What are the flex items?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The list items.

15
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.146
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The lis.

16
00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:50.872
Could the figure tag be our flex

17
00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:55.814
items?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Could the figure tag be

18
00:00:55.814 --> 00:00:59.959
our flex item?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many say yes?

19
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.735
How many say no?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How many say I don't know?

20
00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07.220
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

21
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.920
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so the answer is no,

22
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.710
and the reason why is if your
flex container is the ul,

23
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.330
only the direct children
can be flex items.

24
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.700
So the figures are grandchildren.

25
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.400
Okay, so

26
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.670
the figures cannot, they actually have
no flex properties associated with them.

27
00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:27.474
The only thing,

28
00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:33.130
if we have the ul as our flex container,
only the lis become flex items.

29
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.830
All right, so given that, and
the ul's gonna become our flex container.

30
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.620
Let's go on ahead and add to it then
the appropriate styles to make it do that.

31
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.790
What do I need to add here to the ul?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Display: flex.

32
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.684
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Display: flex,

33
00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:48.760
always a good start.

34
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:58.200
And what else?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Flex-flow?

35
00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.704
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about

36
00:01:58.704 --> 00:02:02.270
a flex-flow?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: And

37
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.069
how would we like our images to display?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Row.

38
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.830
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: How about a row?

39
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.750
Do we want them to wrap onto the next row?

40
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.700
Probably a good idea.

41
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.150
Okay, so if we just do that much,
let's look at our

42
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.218
webpage.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So

43
00:02:22.218 --> 00:02:25.380
that's not bad, right off the bat, right?

44
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.010
Okay, so we have a bunch of images here.

45
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.920
You could play some games now
with justify content, right?

46
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.813
So you can sort of see,
especially in this view,

47
00:02:36.813 --> 00:02:39.268
you can see we have a bit
of a rag going on here.

48
00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:44.271
Again, like paragraphs have that rag
on the right edge, in English anyway.

49
00:02:44.271 --> 00:02:45.241
You can see here,

50
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:49.670
we have a bit of a rag going on in
the edge of these images, okay?

51
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.780
So every image is displaying at
its current dimensions, all right?

52
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.720
And you can see these are just displaying,
however many that they display,

53
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.500
row by row until we get
here to the bottom.

54
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.520
I made a couple of tweaks to this to
make things a little bit prettier.

55
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.670
So what I added to that is I added an li.

56
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.250
This is solution one, which is these are
just gonna display however many on a row

57
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.110
that they happen to display.

58
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.040
So on my li,
I added to this a flex: auto, okay?

59
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.118
So that's gonna give me an automatic space

60
00:03:33.118 --> 00:03:37.923
these things out evenly kind of effect.

61
00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:41.813
Okay, so that spaces them out
a little bit more evenly on the page,

62
00:03:41.813 --> 00:03:45.856
see that?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and

63
00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:52.592
then the very last thing that I did,
which I think makes it kinda pretty,

64
00:03:52.592 --> 00:03:57.690
is on the images,
I gave it a width of 100%, okay?

65
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.550
So this means that my images are now
going to expand to fill the width of

66
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.460
what?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Container.

67
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.583
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Their container, and

68
00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.480
what's the container for the image?

69
00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:13.480
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Li.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Figure.

70
00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.536
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: It's the figure tag, and

71
00:04:14.536 --> 00:04:16.973
what's the container for the figure tag?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Li.

72
00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:18.864
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: The li, okay.

73
00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:20.967
And figure is a block level element, so

74
00:04:20.967 --> 00:04:24.216
now the image is gonna stretch
to be as wide as the figure tag,

75
00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:29.240
which is a block level element inside of
the li, which is a black level element.

76
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.780
And if we refresh our page,
then I think that that just sort of

77
00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.890
fills out kinda nicely,
looks kinda pretty.

78
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.519
All right, and we have different
dimensions going on here,

79
00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:46.144
like this one has more height to it,
right, they all actually have the same or

80
00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:50.293
a similar width, I guess it's
a similar width, it's not the same.

81
00:04:50.293 --> 00:04:54.398
Okay, and here's the bottom one, a little
fuzzy cuz that's probably a little big.

82
00:04:54.398 --> 00:04:55.507
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [LAUGH]

83
00:04:55.507 --> 00:04:56.630
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: All right, and

84
00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.969
then as I make the screen smaller,
then the pictures adjust appropriately.

85
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.300
Adding that image size of 100% also
gives these images the flexibility to do

86
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.570
this very thing that they
change size like this.

87
00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.740
Without that image width of 100%, so

88
00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.931
if I was just to take that out.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: As

89
00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:24.689
we resize the images here on the page,
okay?

90
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.380
They just sort of eventually run into each
other and step on top of each other, okay?

91
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.180
The page doesn't flex nearly
as attractively, shall we say.

92
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.917
All right, so that width of
100% is a really lovely hack.

93
00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:44.468
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay,

94
00:05:44.468 --> 00:05:47.340
that's one possible solution.

95
00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.040
For the other possible solution, I said,

96
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.380
if you have the same number of images per
row, how might you go about doing this?

97
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:58.124
So can anybody suggest
what we might do here

98
00:05:58.124 --> 00:06:02.970
to make that work?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So here on the ul,

99
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.970
is there anything I need to change?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: No.

100
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:09.764
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: No, so we're

101
00:06:09.764 --> 00:06:13.650
still gonna be flex,
we're still gonna be row wrap.

102
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.220
Okay, how about on the li?

103
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.977
What should we do here?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Should

104
00:06:19.977 --> 00:06:22.565
give it flex basis.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Uh-huh,

105
00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:23.900
we need a flex basis.

106
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.070
Anyone suggest a number?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Three.

107
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.872
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: So this is the mobile

108
00:06:32.872 --> 00:06:36.610
sizes, so we want one on a row, right?

109
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.841
So what might be a good size?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: 100%.

110
00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:40.984
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 100%,

111
00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:47.022
100% might be a great size, okay.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: I'm

112
00:06:47.022 --> 00:06:50.218
gonna leave this image
with a width of 100% here.

113
00:06:50.218 --> 00:06:54.220
And then now how would I get
to have different size or

114
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.210
different numbers of images per row?

115
00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:02.970
What would I do then?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: What would I do then?

116
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.740
How do I get different
numbers of images per row?

117
00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.950
If this line 20 here,

118
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.590
this is gonna produce one image
per row at mobile dimensions,

119
00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:19.180
what do I need to modify,
hint hint, in order to get more than

120
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.780
one image per row at different dimensions?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: The basis.

121
00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:24.650
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Yeah, so

122
00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.500
this flex basis is gonna
continue to change.

123
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.432
So here in my media queries,
maybe what I do

124
00:07:32.432 --> 00:07:38.247
is,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Tab,

125
00:07:38.247 --> 00:07:46.030
maybe what I do is something like,
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: 50% here for tablets.

126
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:53.030
And maybe something like 33% for desktop.

127
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.159
I think I also change
these media query numbers,

128
00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:01.195
I think I actually like 605 better and
910, but that's neither here nor

129
00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:06.092
there.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Okay, so

130
00:08:06.092 --> 00:08:10.984
if we go on ahead and refresh the page
then, now we've sort of fixed these, so

131
00:08:10.984 --> 00:08:14.071
that at desktop dimensions,
at 33% a piece,

132
00:08:14.071 --> 00:08:17.870
obviously we're gonna have
three pictures a row, right?

133
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.865
And there they are one, two, three, one,
two, three, one, two, three, one, two,

134
00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:23.415
three, one, two, three, until we run out.

135
00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:29.792
And 17 being a prime number,
[LAUGH] coincidently divisible by nothing.

136
00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:34.087
We have just an empty space here as well.

137
00:08:34.087 --> 00:08:37.359
And then as we scrunch this
down to smaller dimensions,

138
00:08:37.359 --> 00:08:41.200
then we'll go two to a row eventually,
somewhere along the way.

139
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:45.076
There we go, we went to two in a row,
and then finally, of course,

140
00:08:45.076 --> 00:08:49.869
one to a row.
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: Cool?

141
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.263
So that's like the easiest thing in
the world with flex box, isn't it?

142
00:08:55.263 --> 00:08:57.960
You can make a really
nice-looking gallery.

143
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.172
And you can do it in like, what,
five lines of code or something, right?

144
00:09:03.172 --> 00:09:04.719
Pretty awesome.

145
00:09:04.719 --> 00:09:10.607
Okay, any questions on that?
&gt;&gt; Jen Kramer: You test for

146
00:09:10.607 --> 00:09:15.006
the robustness of your answers by, in your
HTML, because, of course, we don't have

147
00:09:15.006 --> 00:09:19.250
a database and all of that stuff set up to
give us different numbers of these things.

148
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:23.920
But you could copy those lines of code,
you can take your 17 and

149
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.710
double it, make 34 of these things.

150
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.500
You could comment some stuff out, and
make sure that your layouts hold up.

151
00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.830
In both of these solutions,

152
00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:34.270
your layouts will hold up no
matter how many images you have.
