[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:08.010
&gt;&gt; Aaron: There's a lot more in the EX6
release that we didn't get to talk about.

3
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.250
We kind of showed it off.

4
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.230
Like I said, a lot of these things
were things we could take an hour on

5
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.430
each at least.

6
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.660
So if we were to go through
everything in here.

7
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.920
And really dive into them as far
as we could, it would take days.

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.070
And so we tried to just bust through
some of the stuff I thought was

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.130
super important.

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.910
We didn't get into string.repeat or
string.startswith or endswith.

11
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.890
We didn't get into the string prototype.

12
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.760
We didn't get into any
of the new array stuff.

13
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.860
Copy within find, find index.

14
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.558
We didn't get any into
the math functions..

15
00:00:44.558 --> 00:00:45.849
Or number.isnan.

16
00:00:45.849 --> 00:00:48.720
Sometimes limitations on that.

17
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.350
But, you know,
those are all additions to it.

18
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.050
I covered the stuff I thought was going to
affect the everyday developer, every day.

19
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.890
So, any questions?

20
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.570
And they don't have to be related
to what we just talked about.

21
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.280
You could ask a question about anything.

22
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.180
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: How did you already try to
use it with a framework like angular,

23
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.790
for instance.

24
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.119
And I know that angular two is going
to support your six negatively.

25
00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.340
But theoretically,
you could already do it?

26
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.560
&gt;&gt; Aaron: Yes, so tracers actually have
meant a lot of stuff for the angular team,

27
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.190
specifically.

28
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.675
And so, you can get in there and see that
voida has committed to the tracer project.

29
00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:36.612
And they're taking tracer pretty serious.

30
00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:42.470
And angular 2.0 is likely
going to be a compile thing.

31
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.270
So if anyone's played around with React.

32
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.700
You can do this JSX thing.

33
00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.520
Where it's like you're putting
HTML in your JavaScript.

34
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.900
And then you have to build
it into like a wonky.

35
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.040
You could do it manually.

36
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.520
But they just made it easy.

37
00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.590
And so you have a built step.

38
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.920
You have a compile time step.

39
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.600
Which is okay.

40
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.524
I mean, it's honestly not the worst
thing that that's ever happened to you.

41
00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:07.490
And angular is probably going
to have something similar.

42
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.440
And I think ember's moving that way, too.

43
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.610
So I'm thinking most of the stuff in
the future that's trying to move fast.

44
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.306
And still support legacy is going
to start having build steps.

45
00:02:17.306 --> 00:02:19.370
So most of this stuff we do,
going forward.

46
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.650
You're not going to get much further,
without having a compile face for

47
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.200
your code.

48
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.712
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I actually meant, did you
already try to use it in the existing

49
00:02:27.712 --> 00:02:29.500
angular code?

50
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.200
&gt;&gt; Aaron: No.

51
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.310
No, no I haven't.

52
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.950
But I'm dying to use classes.

53
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.223
I think you can get some serious
benefits out of classes in angular.

54
00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:42.378
And, like I said, you could do it
with functions prototype anyway.

55
00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:45.956
But yeah, anyway.

56
00:02:45.956 --> 00:02:48.060
Questions?

57
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.820
Any other questions?

58
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.740
Doesn't have to be related to this.

59
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.900
No?

60
00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.280
&gt;&gt; Aaron: So on every slide,
I whored out my twitter account.

61
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.600
So you should be able to just contact me.

62
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.570
I'm @JSDev on Twitter.

63
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.940
And feel free to just tweet me.

64
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.620
And I'll try and help you out, if I can.

65
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.800
Definitely come punch me in
the back of the head if you

66
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.130
see me at a conference
in the future though.

67
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.768
That would be fun.

68
00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:26.190
So.
Yeah, question?

69
00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.130
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Somebody's asking,
you were talking about someone west,

70
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.710
good references on the generator subject.

71
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.960
&gt;&gt; Aaron: Yeah, so
his name's Kyle Simpson.

72
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.960
He gave a talk at HTML5DevConf.

73
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.240
And he's got a talk about generators.

74
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.850
He also gave a friend in Masters Course,
where he,

75
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.260
of all the EX6 stuff,
he went into LET quite a bit.

76
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.290
And he went into generators quite a bit.

77
00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.820
And so,
if you're really interested in generators.

78
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.148
And I know a lot of you are,
based on the feedback.

79
00:03:56.148 --> 00:04:00.390
Go ahead and check out his stuff.

80
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.960
Where he spends a significant
amount of time on that topic.

81
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.140
Like I said, any one of these topics.

82
00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.960
Some of them, we could talk about for
hours and hours and hours, right?

83
00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.060
But others are good bite-size things.

84
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.930
But generators is one of those things
where you really could go deep dive.

85
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.190
And just thinking about all
the things you could do with them.

86
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.390
And going out and asking everyone.

87
00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.660
And then showing that off.

88
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.280
You really could spend a lot of time.

89
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.866
So the amount of time
we will spend in here.

90
00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:35.460
It wasn't as much as we could have spent.

91
00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.070
We definitely could spend a lot more
time on most of these these features.

92
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.150
So yeah.

93
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.980
If you're interested, check out that.

94
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.605
That's for sure.

95
00:04:42.605 --> 00:04:46.826
But if you're also wanting to see what
the changes they're still talking about

96
00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:47.930
with them.

97
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.080
Go and check out the ES discuss notes.

98
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.590
Like every month,
when they're talking about it.

99
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.850
Those monthly notes have some good stuff.

100
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:54.900
So yeah, check those out too.
