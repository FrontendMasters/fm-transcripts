[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.694 --> 00:00:08.210
&gt;&gt; Aaron: So we did a just Java
podcasts just a few weeks ago.

3
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.910
If you didn't listen to it,
it was two hours long.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.410
It was it was the longest just Java ever.

5
00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.976
And Brendan just talked and talked and
talked and were like asking him questions,

6
00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.714
and it was like 30 minutes later
we could ask him another one,

7
00:00:20.714 --> 00:00:23.055
cuz he just stayed there explain and
explain so much.

8
00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:23.961
And it was awesome.

9
00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:29.621
But I'm gonna kinda disseminate some of
what I learned there and some of the stuff

10
00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:34.880
that you can learn through other books and
through other people's talks.

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.170
So in 1985,
Brendan graduates from Illinois and

12
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.200
he starts working in the tech field.

13
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.898
And he eventually winds up at
a company called SGI which is

14
00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:50.521
Silicon Graphics International,
and these company,

15
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:55.210
essentially they make the GPU,
and he's on board with them.

16
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.006
And while he's at Illinois, while he's at
SGI, he makes some acquaintances, okay?

17
00:00:59.006 --> 00:01:03.936
And then around 1994,
two of the acquaintances break off and

18
00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:07.650
they're like hey,
let's start our own thing.

19
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.677
So Marc and Jim,
I can't remember what NCSA,

20
00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:16.340
National Center for
Supercomputing Applications.

21
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.632
So, that's at the University of
Illinois where Brandon studied.

22
00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:26.914
Anyway so, they're like,
hey let's go start a company,

23
00:01:26.914 --> 00:01:29.747
we're gonna call it
Mosaic Communications MCom.

24
00:01:29.747 --> 00:01:33.579
And then Mosaics is gonna
freak out about that, right?

25
00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.025
So, they're like hey, change you name.

26
00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:37.270
So, they rebrand as Netscape.

27
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.999
So, did anyone use Netscape?

28
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.770
Yeah, I kinda miss the Netscape days.

29
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.722
I didn't really ever use it, so anyway.

30
00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:51.301
So in October 13,
1994 Netscape Navigator is released.

31
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:53.106
And this is the homepage,

32
00:01:53.106 --> 00:01:57.140
did you guys remember when
the internet looked like this?

33
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.410
This is like how sweet it used to get.

34
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.370
This logo is awesome and
there's a lot of stuff.

35
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.110
Like they'll teach you
how to use the Internet,

36
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.770
to get around just click any blue or
purple word phrase.

37
00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.260
So this is an example, so

38
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.260
I can click that and
it's like hey you just Interneted right.

39
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.767
And so,
anyway it was super basic back then.

40
00:02:25.767 --> 00:02:29.336
And this is how Netscape released and
this was their sales page.

41
00:02:29.336 --> 00:02:36.268
So, if you guys check out my slides on
GitHub, check this page out specifically,

42
00:02:36.268 --> 00:02:41.500
it's a gem and I'm happy that
the Internet kept this around.

43
00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.190
So, six months later,
they've launched, it's going well.

44
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.110
They're like, hey,
let's talk to our friend Brendan, and

45
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.540
let's have him come build
Scheme in the browser.

46
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.360
Cuz we want the browser to
have some app like features,

47
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.890
and maybe, who knows, maybe you could even
move something around, I don't even know.

48
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.940
So they talk to him,
he's like, yeah I'm onboard.

49
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.320
In April 1995, they hire him to the wrong
team, they hire him to the client or

50
00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.740
the server team which he was like,
well, whatevs.

51
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.130
I'll be on the server team.

52
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.060
So he's there for
a month because they switched him in May,

53
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.631
but he's sitting there and Netscape
while he's there that first month,

54
00:03:23.631 --> 00:03:29.940
Sans is like, put Java in the browser,
put Java in Netscape.

55
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.880
So there's this huge pressure, internally,
to get Java running in the browser.

56
00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.226
And so, Brendan is watching this,
and he's seeing it, and in 95,

57
00:03:38.226 --> 00:03:40.003
he switches over to the client team.

58
00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:44.093
And he's faced with this
Java Netscape thing and

59
00:03:44.093 --> 00:03:48.790
he's trying to figure out,
is this the way we wanna go?

60
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.023
And there's a bunch of guys there,
they're going through some crazy stuff.

61
00:03:52.023 --> 00:03:56.313
Go check out the just Java episode,
like they we're gonna implement their own

62
00:03:56.313 --> 00:03:59.510
Java Virtual Machine,
just to not have to go through San.

63
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.940
And then they're gonna
write JavaScript on top.

64
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.570
Anyways, but it was about to get crazy.

65
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.920
And then they like now we
should build JavaScript.

66
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.956
So he helped them to decide Java
was not the language of the web.

67
00:04:09.956 --> 00:04:13.940
And he's asked some reasons why,
he says it's too complex and

68
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.864
here's some of the things he talked about,
he said constantly running JavaC,

69
00:04:18.864 --> 00:04:22.190
you have to understand
the main method on a class.

70
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.310
And this isn't for a casual or
amateur programmer.

71
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.160
He decided like Java is a language for
curated programmers and not for

72
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.789
the web which was gonna
have some more casual or

73
00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.756
amateur programmers which none of
us should take offense to, right?

74
00:04:36.756 --> 00:04:38.350
Cuz it's changed since then.

75
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.388
He's like we need something more like
VB but clearly we don't want VB.

76
00:04:43.388 --> 00:04:46.690
[COUGH] And he's like I want
something that's meant for

77
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.020
people who are just learning to
program for the very first time.

78
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:55.030
So this was kind of
the idea that they had and

79
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.870
consequently this is where the idea
of automatic some icons came from.

80
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.016
So that it was like super forgiving for
these people who forgot and

81
00:05:03.016 --> 00:05:07.800
we're not gonna kill them over semicolons,

82
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.480
so that's kind of where that came from,
was them trying to be super forgiving.

83
00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.470
So he starts this project and he talks
about ten day, like, they didn't sit down

84
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.320
and be like, hey, you have ten days,
like, on this day, you're doing the thing.

85
00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.280
But he needed to present to his team
his alternative to Java before they got

86
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.820
roped into doing Java in the browser.

87
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.800
So does anyone know what this code
name project that he worked on for

88
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.360
ten days was?

89
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.880
Does anyone know?

90
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.690
Code name?

91
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.680
Anybody on the live stream?

92
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.930
If you watch [INAUDIBLE] you know.

93
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.300
Anyway, so they call it MOCHA.

94
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:42.406
So MOCHA was the name of the project.

95
00:05:42.406 --> 00:05:47.010
And this was the name that Brendan kind
of wanted to stick with long term.

96
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.480
So MOCHA, after they've build and

97
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.880
they've used internally they go through
a beta process and they changed its name.

98
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.560
Does anyone remember what
the first name of JavaScript

99
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.290
was?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: LiveScript?

100
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.189
&gt;&gt; Aaron: Yes, it was LiveScript.

101
00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.990
Does anyone know where
the name LiveScript came from?

102
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.420
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: From marketing.

103
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.350
&gt;&gt; Aaron: From marketing, yes.

104
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.840
So Netscape had another
project called LiveWire.

105
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.433
So they had a server package
called LiveWire and so

106
00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:24.001
they just kind of adopted the Live brand,
and so they're like LiveScript, LiveWire,

107
00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:25.834
we're just gonna do the live but.

108
00:06:25.834 --> 00:06:28.986
Anyway, so

109
00:06:28.986 --> 00:06:32.960
the goal is to call it JavaScript,
at least from the honchos there.

110
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.025
And so, in December of 95,

111
00:06:36.025 --> 00:06:41.590
San signs a thing saying, yeah,
you guys can use the word Java.

112
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:47.290
And that was a big deal, because there was
this guy his name was like Javanski or

113
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:52.860
something and he own Javanski.com and
San was like,

114
00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.450
take your website down because it uses
the word Java and we've trademarked it.

115
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.240
He's like dude, this is like my ancestors
had this name hundreds of years ago,

116
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.930
what do you mean?

117
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.880
You can't possibly own Javanski or
whatever.

118
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.441
So it was a big deal that San was
like you can use the name, so

119
00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:15.658
that was huge and that's ultimately
why they call it JavaScript,

120
00:07:15.658 --> 00:07:19.544
and so
JavaScript is official in December 95.

121
00:07:19.544 --> 00:07:23.570
So in it's first year people kinda
start doing some stuff with it.

122
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:27.920
They're like hey, let's do some single
page stuff, which we like to think of

123
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.160
single page jobs as being a thing that
started in 2005 with Ajax revolution,

124
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.690
but they were doing crazy stuff.

125
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:38.533
They're like hey, if I need to get
more data, I'm wanna do this thing or

126
00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:41.809
I embed an iframe with the URL
that's specific to what I need,

127
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:45.719
and then it will load data, and I'll
pull it out of there up to the parent.

128
00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:51.820
So doing all sorts of hacky stuff to kinda
get the same type of functionality, right?

129
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:58.560
And they're kind of discover in
the quirks of the DOM, like if you select

130
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.600
everything with the same tag, you just
get an array no matter how deep they are.

131
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.305
People are kinda discovering that and

132
00:08:05.305 --> 00:08:07.870
they're discovering what
the good parts are.

133
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.040
The stuff that they do and

134
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.710
don't like, people are already
starting to form opinions.

135
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.113
And then there's danger lurking though.

136
00:08:15.113 --> 00:08:19.330
[COUGH] Anyone have any idea, danger?

137
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:24.190
So in late 96, Microsoft complaints,

138
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.690
they're like, cuz Microsoft is trying
copy this and emulate this, right?

139
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.440
But they're like hey, Netscape, you
guys keep changing the API way too much,

140
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.480
you guys got to stop it.

141
00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.450
Like you leave the API solid so
that we can be in parity.

142
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.650
Which isn't the worst complaint ever,
right?

143
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.480
Except for this Microsoft, and
they do the exact same thing.

144
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:50.420
And so Netscape is like Jeez Microsoft
is gonna like own this thing.

145
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.920
Microsoft is gonna trying
to take this over.

146
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.560
We got figure a way to keep JavaScript
safe so that Microsoft doesn't come in and

147
00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:58.540
just kinda pummel it.
