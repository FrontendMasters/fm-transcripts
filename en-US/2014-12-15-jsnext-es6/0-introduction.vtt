[MUSIC]

2
00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:41.493
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: So I'm excited to be here.

3
00:00:41.493 --> 00:00:45.430
I'm happy that Mark invited me.

4
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.430
Of all the people that could come and
talk about, ES6, I'm like the worst one.

5
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.550
Everyone who's involved with it is
amazing, and I hope that today we can

6
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.860
kind of show what they've worked on for
the last three or

7
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.010
four years and kinda understand
how their process works and

8
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.970
get an idea of where these
new features are coming from,

9
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.580
as well as kind of get
a solid handle on them.

10
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.720
So let's just kind of dive right in.

11
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.610
I'm gonna do a little about me real quick.

12
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.572
So I started in development
as a QA person.

13
00:01:18.572 --> 00:01:20.480
I was a QA person for years.

14
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.194
Any other reformed Q.A. people?

15
00:01:22.194 --> 00:01:25.231
No one raised their hand.

16
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:27.400
Okay, so I'm also a college dropout.

17
00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.200
I went to the local community
college in Salt Lake and

18
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.520
I was studying computer science.

19
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.740
And that lasted like, I was going my
Associates and I dropped out after three

20
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.170
years which doesn't make any sense but
I still wasn't done.

21
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.070
So,anyway, I started
learning JavaScript with,

22
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.958
does anyone know, have an idea
where I start learning JavaScript?

23
00:01:50.958 --> 00:01:53.260
What technology?

24
00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.150
My guess is no one.

25
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.310
So, I start with browser extensions.

26
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.120
It's kind of started dorking around in my
own time, I was like dude I can change

27
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.670
the font size on any site that I want or
I can delete things I don't like there.

28
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.190
Add new features like find out which of my
friends is unfriending me on Facebook and

29
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.700
stuff like that.

30
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.787
Anyway, that was where I started and

31
00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:20.896
[COUGH] the second I tried
JavaScript I was okay I'm in.

32
00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:24.080
This language is what they
should have taught me in school.

33
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.050
This language is awesome.

34
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.680
So, I fell in love with JavaScript.

35
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.380
So, I'm also a husband, and a father.

36
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.430
I have two girls and a boy.

37
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.890
And then there's another boy on the way,

38
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.960
so just crazy full speed
ahead with the family.

39
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.749
I love to ice fish.

40
00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.290
Any ice fishers, since we're in Minnesota?

41
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.338
Okay, we got one and
a half hand, three hands.

42
00:02:45.338 --> 00:02:46.729
Two and a half hands.

43
00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:47.290
Okay.

44
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.280
And obviously everyone in
the front already knew this.

45
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.220
I'm the good looking of the twins but
I have an identical twin so

46
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.576
if you ever see me and
I don't say hi, it was him, right?

47
00:02:59.576 --> 00:03:01.530
It wasn't me.

48
00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.890
But yeah.

49
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.750
I'm also a senior developer
at a company called Domo and

50
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.240
I'm on a couple podcasts,
JS Jabber and Adventure in Angular.

51
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.160
And I wrote,
I'm writing a book with O'Reilly

52
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.240
on this topic that we're
going to talk about today.

53
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.970
And because of that, I've gotten to,
I'm not going to say friends,

54
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.698
I've made acquaintances with a handful
of the people that are in charge of

55
00:03:28.698 --> 00:03:33.310
steering Ecma ECMAScript,

56
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.960
which is the API that
the JavaScript implements.

57
00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.090
And so I'm writing a book, hopefully
it's coming out sometime in 2015.

58
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.560
I started writing it a few years ago,

59
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.320
to be honest with you,
and it's changed so much.

60
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.780
I'd write a chapter, and
then they overhaul the feature and so

61
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.360
I gotta rewrite the chapter and it was
just a lot of work, so I kind of stopped.

62
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.810
And then talking to
Rick Waldron a few weeks ago,

63
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.350
sounds right now might be
a good time to get back in.

64
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.230
Things have kind of finalized for
the most part.

65
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.158
I also wrote a short book
you can get online for free.

66
00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:10.870
It's called JS.Next- A Manager's Guide.

67
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.630
Just to, kind of, help you sell your
management on why we should alienate

68
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.370
Legacy browsers and get the new stuff in.

69
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.140
And I'm also an AngularJS GDE.

70
00:04:22.014 --> 00:04:25.710
GDE is a Google developer expert,
so I was nominated for that.

71
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.010
Additionally, did anyone go to to NG Conf?

72
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.230
Any NG Conf people?

73
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.680
Okay, so I also organize NG Conf.

74
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.270
Which is the first the biggest
Angular conference.

75
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.670
We just announced last week the the new
one coming up on March 5th and

76
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.450
6th so we're excited.

77
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.180
If someone is someone asks a question,
I'm not gonna say I don't know,

78
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.020
I'm gonna say, If I don't know I'm
going to say, we'll write it down and

79
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.780
I'll answer after the break.

80
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.220
So, can we get someone, a volunteer,
to write down questions if I say,

81
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.910
can you write it down?

82
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.250
My man.
Okay.

83
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.900
So, I'll just look at your and say,
"Can you write that down?" Okay.

84
00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.060
All right.
So,

85
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.470
Rick Waldron again he curated the slides.

86
00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.938
Again I was not present in
the meetings with the TC39.

87
00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:21.870
So Rick who,
he's like the father of Johnny-Five

88
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.870
which is a library for
using JavaScript to talk to NodeBots.

89
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.540
He's also on the TC39.

90
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.150
He works a Boku and
he is just all around the guy.

91
00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.330
He curated the stuff.

92
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.580
He showed him my errors.

93
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.600
And he gave me insight.

94
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.900
He kinda told me some antics about some of

95
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.420
the decisions around
the features that were made.

96
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.950
So I just wanted to give
a shout out to Rick.

97
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.390
He helped out here and he's a good guy.

98
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.290
So we're gonna talk about
these topics today.

99
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.810
We're gonna talk about the history
of JavaScript and kinda the steering

100
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.885
committee and then we'll talk about new
features and then some build tools.

101
00:05:57.885 --> 00:06:00.570
And the build tools seems a little
bit wild westie still but

102
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.420
we're gonna talk about it just to kinda
get everyone over the intimidation

103
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.510
curve of you don't know where to start so
we'll get in and we'll jump into that.

104
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.770
So I kind of wanted to show off
real quick all the features.

105
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.020
So this table here is
the ES6 compatibility table.

106
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.370
And it shows you what browsers
support ES6 and which ones don't.

107
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.150
So you can see in my current browser,
which is Chrome,

108
00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.300
if you look in this column right
here we've got a lot of red.

109
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.965
So ES6 is still mostly
unsupported until you get

110
00:06:38.965 --> 00:06:44.062
down to like maths and
array prototype stuff.

111
00:06:44.062 --> 00:06:47.470
But anyway it's still kind of out there,

112
00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.510
not a ton of solid support, even
the support that is there is inconsistent.

113
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.160
And if you guys while I'm gonna
show off the inconsistencies I can,

114
00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.860
but between Firefox and Tracer,

115
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.400
there will be inconsistencies and
I'll try and talk a little bit about that.

116
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.630
But as you can see,
there's a lot of features here,

117
00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.180
too much to talk about in one class.

118
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:10.400
Some of these features on their
own are an hour long class, and

119
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.060
we don't have an hour to
give to every subject.

120
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:17.676
So I picked the ones that I think
are the ones you guys need to know and

121
00:07:17.676 --> 00:07:21.100
if we're going to spend a day talking
about it, these are the ones I would want

122
00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.090
to learn and so
that's what we're talking with today.

123
00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:29.235
But just to kinda give you a comparison,
if you click on the ES5 compatibility,

124
00:07:29.235 --> 00:07:32.200
this is how compatible
everyone is with ES5.

125
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.794
So everyone pretty much
does ES5 pretty well.

126
00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:41.860
It's not, it's just kind of the ES6
stuff that's still being decided and

127
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.570
still kind of in the works.

128
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:44.200
So, anyway.

129
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.420
So when we talk about it.

130
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.640
As I teach about it I'm gonna kinda talk
about a little bit where they came from.

131
00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:54.834
We'll do some examples.

132
00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:58.539
We'll try and walk you through all
the different uses of the new stuff and

133
00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:02.304
then I'm gonna give you guys some time
to use it and then I'll come back and

134
00:08:02.304 --> 00:08:04.085
I'll give you some suggestions.

135
00:08:04.085 --> 00:08:06.421
And then we'll come code
those live afterwards.

136
00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:10.560
I kinda want everyone to get some
time practicing the new syntax.

137
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.663
So this is, this slide here's where
we're gonna spend the rest of our day.

138
00:08:13.663 --> 00:08:15.340
We're gonna go through these topics here.
