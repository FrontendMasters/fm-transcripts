[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.115
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: I wanna talk about
some of the goals of the TC39,

3
00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:10.340
cuz they're the ones steering the ship
that we've all decided to be on.

4
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.010
So they want Java to be a better language.

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.720
They've got three,
among other goals, three big ones.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.150
They want it to be possible to
write complex applications with it.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.510
And they want it to be a great
language for writing libraries in.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.870
And they want it to be great for
code generators.

9
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.640
They want it to be a solid
compile to language.

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.510
Something that you can compile into and
do that effectively.

11
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.300
They also want a testable
specification and

12
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
you guys will see today they
are adopting de facto standards.

13
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.590
So just whatever the industry
seems to be doing,

14
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.530
if that's the standard everyone's liking,
they're gonna try and

15
00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.540
adopt those rather than try a brand
new feature on their own, right?

16
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.740
And you guys are gonna see,
any coffee script developers here?

17
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.533
So we're gonna see a lot of copy scripts
today, a lot of those features and

18
00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:03.440
a lot of Pythonish type features
coming into JavaScript now.

19
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.470
So, if you go to esdiscuss.org/notes,

20
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.800
you can see all the notes from their
meetings they have once a month.

21
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.480
And they do them in
different places every time.

22
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.160
And then a lot of times,
like when you're talking about ES6,

23
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.790
people are like, dude, that's in ES.Next
or JS.Next or that's in ES6 or Harmony.

24
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.960
Like, they use these three
words interchangeably.

25
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.260
They don't mean the same thing,
like, they mean different things.

26
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.050
So I wanted to kind of talk
about what it is that they mean.

27
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.250
So in harmony this is like, so
we've got the current releases over here.

28
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.430
This is like the ES3 features,
the ES5 features, and the ES5.1 features.

29
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.440
These are already shipped in production
and packaged and released, right?

30
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.709
And then you got this whole other bucket.

31
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.050
And these are all features
from the future go here, okay.

32
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.476
So this big bucket where all
the future features are at,

33
00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:01.740
that's called Harmony, okay?

34
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.544
And then there's this spot
in the bucket which is like

35
00:02:06.544 --> 00:02:10.192
the pointer to the next release, okay.

36
00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:13.940
And this is called ES.NET, right.

37
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.847
And currently there's a release
in that spot and it's ES6.

38
00:02:16.847 --> 00:02:23.710
So ES6 is currently sitting in the next
seat but we're about to ship that, right.

39
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.681
So once that ships, ES6 is gonna
go over to the shipped package,

40
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:32.564
the one of these shipped releases and
ES7 is gonna drop into the ES.NEXT spot.

41
00:02:32.564 --> 00:02:36.000
So ES.NEXT is a pointer to
whatever the next release

42
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.970
is that they're currently working on.

43
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.520
Harmony is all the stuff,
whether it's gonna be included or not.

44
00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.230
Like we've all heard a Harmony
feature called object.observe, right.

45
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.640
That's not ES6, that's ES7.

46
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:55.080
So there are features that are currently
under development that are in ES6.

47
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.490
So, does anyone have any questions
about like those three buckets or

48
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.390
anything about like the history
that we just talked about?

49
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.080
Because that was our history lesson for
the day.

50
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.910
So I see a question here.

51
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.700
Can you tell us more about Straw Man?

52
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.540
And so straw man, I'm gonna just
pull up the spec real quick.

53
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.049
One second.

54
00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.050
These proposals, okay.

55
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.057
So this page right here
is the harmony proposals.

56
00:03:30.057 --> 00:03:34.000
We talked about Harmony being
this big bucket, this big idea.

57
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.136
So on this proposal's list.

58
00:03:36.136 --> 00:03:39.100
You've kind of got all the features
that they wanna drop into the language.

59
00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.630
And some of them we're gonna see and
some of them have been pushed, I got here,

60
00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.050
remember we talked about object.observe.

61
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.720
So like that's kinda
down here at the bottom.

62
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.860
Can everyone see that,
sorry that's kinda small.

63
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.430
I'm gonna make it bigger.

64
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.620
So we've got object.observe
down here on the bottom.

65
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.160
And we've got a bunch of other features,
like let's find.

66
00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.190
So like generators.

67
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.320
Who's excited for generators?

68
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.430
On the survey, we said a lot of
people were like, yeah generators.

69
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.220
So like generator expressions were
supposed to be in, they got pushed.

70
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.730
It's still being hashed out.

71
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.163
So these straw man
proposals are kind of like,

72
00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:21.897
they're kinda like a puppet version of
this idea that they wanna implement.

73
00:04:21.897 --> 00:04:25.331
They don't have any implementation ideas
or [INAUDIBLE] of how they all work but

74
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.850
it is an idea of how it should work.

75
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.580
So do you guys have any questions about,
hey, what are they strawmanning,

76
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.630
what are they currently thinking
about doing in the next version,

77
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.430
this is a place where you could
come to to find that out.

78
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.187
But also if you go to ES discuss and
you go to the notes.

79
00:04:45.187 --> 00:04:50.127
This notes page would also show
you what they're talking about.

80
00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:52.440
So they met three days in July.

81
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.097
If you wanted to see those notes
from the 31st, you come in here and

82
00:04:58.097 --> 00:05:03.268
you can kind of see who's talking what,
who's saying what.

83
00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:04.910
And you can kind of see
who the players are.

84
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.120
So Alan Wasbrack, we've got Jeff Morison,
we've got Voodoo Kats, Sebastian Markets.

85
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.818
So, you can kind of see
who the players are and

86
00:05:12.818 --> 00:05:14.870
who's getting involved in what features.

87
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.420
If you wanna stay up to date on the stuff.

88
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.790
You can also follow ES Discuss on Twitter.

89
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.480
I think it's Jason Orndorff who
runs the Twitter account and

90
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.200
he kind of posts 140 character gems
about what they talk about so.

91
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.427
Anyway, that's another thing.

92
00:05:35.427 --> 00:05:36.871
And if you follow the Twitter handle,

93
00:05:36.871 --> 00:05:38.890
you'll also be able to see
when they post new notes.

94
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.650
When the notes gets uploaded,
they'll tweet it out.

95
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:48.161
How that answered the guy who
wants to know about straw man?

96
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.260
So, we've got a question, how do
some proposals move to ES7 from ES6?

97
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.980
So I'll give you the idea, and
then I'll show an example.

98
00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.150
So, they've eventually
gotta ship software.

99
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.220
Some of us know, we have been at work
where, we don't release, we don't release,

100
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.510
because we're trying to
make something perfect and

101
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.240
we wanna rewrite it and revamp it.

102
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.450
But eventually, you gotta cut or
release, right?

103
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.040
So ES6 is gotta be cut eventually
like if they sit here and

104
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.210
rev on classes until everyone agrees,
they will never release classes.

105
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.800
Because not everyone is gonna agree
ever on that one specifically.

106
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.030
And so, when they get to a point where
we're not agreeing on it, it gets pushed.

107
00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.630
And they do that, that's kind of like
where everyone has to accept it.

108
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.460
If we can't agree on it,

109
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.860
it's not going in and
everyone is gonna have to embrace that.

110
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:42.290
If the whole community doesn't agree with
you, you can't be really emotional that

111
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:44.640
everyone else doesn't
defend your point of view.

112
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.380
That's just how it is.

113
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.055
So let me give you an example classes and
we will talk about this later.

114
00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:58.360
But if you go down to the very bottom of
this class [INAUDIBLE] up a little bit.

115
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:03.360
You see this right here.

116
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.730
This is intended as a closed-ended
proposal and is not open for

117
00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.680
major feature additions.

118
00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.960
So the name of this page is
maximally minimal classes.

119
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.202
So it's not classes,
this is what we could do to get it out.

120
00:07:20.202 --> 00:07:22.766
And if you read this,
it says future edition of x or

121
00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:26.320
episodic ECMAScript may and
probably will extend this definition.

122
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.960
However, for the intend of ES6,

123
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.770
is only to include the features
described in this proposal.

124
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.420
Attempting to extend this proposal
is likely to result in deadlock

125
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.340
that would result in the inclusion of
no class definition support in ES6.

126
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:43.050
So eventually,

127
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.980
if no one can agree on your stuff, you
are gonna get bumped to the next release.

128
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.880
So if you really, really care about it,
you've either got to get ready to

129
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.040
compromise or you gotta get ready
to push you to the next release.

130
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.770
And so,
that's kind of how things get moved out.

131
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.940
So anything that you saw moved out,

132
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.710
obviously something you really cared
about, like array comprehensions.

133
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:03.540
Some people write arrays comprehensions,

134
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.700
they got pushed because they
couldn't agree on that.

135
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.290
Maybe it was the syntax,
maybe some people wanted a more powerful,

136
00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.180
maybe some people wanted different syntax
around it but for whatever reason things

137
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.980
are getting pushed when the strawman
proposals can get accepted fast enough.

138
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:25.342
So hopefully that answered
everyone's questions.

139
00:08:25.342 --> 00:08:27.160
Said what are the factors?

140
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.070
That probably varies prospect,
I don't know.

141
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:32.140
Okay, he says the answer is good.

142
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.650
Yes, okay.

143
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:38.620
So that was the history of JavaScript.

144
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.260
We're good to move on.

145
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:40.960
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: One thing

146
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.930
I think somebody mentions on slide 31 and
34, the groupings were just backwards.

147
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:47.156
Can you just maybe make know that?

148
00:08:47.156 --> 00:08:48.152
I think [INAUDIBLE].

149
00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:50.225
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Like Microsoft, Yahoo.

150
00:08:50.225 --> 00:08:51.739
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Did I put
them on the wrong side?

151
00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.661
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Basically, your slides
on one thing but then on your graphic.

152
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:57.737
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: It was the opposite?

153
00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:58.468
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah, it was the opposite.

154
00:08:58.468 --> 00:09:01.573
So your slides are real-
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Slides are the real thing.

155
00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.739
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Okay, so-
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Not the graphic.

156
00:09:03.739 --> 00:09:05.594
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: The graphic, yeah okay.

157
00:09:05.594 --> 00:09:09.045
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Yeah,
sorry guys didn't mean to confuse anyone.

158
00:09:09.045 --> 00:09:14.609
Hopefully everyone's- [CROSSTALK]
So

159
00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:16.160
I'm gonna talk about these features today.

160
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.395
These are what we're gonna learn.

161
00:09:17.395 --> 00:09:22.486
Some of these, I could do an hour and
a half two hours on each.

162
00:09:22.486 --> 00:09:23.860
We don't have that kind of time today.

163
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.995
So, on some of them where you guys were
like, dude go all the way deep man, go,

164
00:09:27.995 --> 00:09:28.880
do more of that.

165
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.894
It was like I'm not gonna do everything
about all of it because we don't have

166
00:09:31.894 --> 00:09:33.030
enough time.

167
00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:37.810
And it's a thing that we could spend

168
00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.770
a week on if we were seriously like,
let's talk about all the intricacies and

169
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.050
the nuances of every new feature, it
would take us a really, really long time.

170
00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.890
So I've picked these ones out and
this is what we're gonna talk about today.
