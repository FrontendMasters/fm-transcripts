[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:08.756
&gt;&gt; A. Frost: So we're gonna move on to
classes.t Who's stoked about classes?

3
00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.030
&gt;&gt; A. Frost: See, I got one, I got two.

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.700
&gt;&gt; Audience1: Classes sound good,
let's do some.

5
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.720
&gt;&gt; A. Frost: Three,
all right, we've got classes.

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.200
I'm gonna be honest with you, I wasn't.

7
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.070
Cuz I started working in JavaVille,
where it's like,

8
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.090
horrible service implementor
factory service proxy.

9
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.070
You know like, why did you name it that?

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.090
That's the worst possible
name you could have named it.

11
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.452
And so I'm like, dude,
Java if I ever have a JavaScript object

12
00:00:48.452 --> 00:00:53.311
that's named
com.frontendMaster's.services.,

13
00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:58.080
I'm going to give up,
I'm moving to another country.

14
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.140
I got really scared that was going
to happen, and it is gonna happen.

15
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.710
Like, who doubts it?

16
00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.260
Who doubts it?

17
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.080
Just for the record,
no one raised their hand.

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.670
It's gonna happen, and so I am nervous.

19
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950
I am nervous about that.

20
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.560
It think the community, though, will fight
it back and keep it down to a minimum.

21
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.190
Which so I got over it.

22
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.958
But then once I learned you can
extend built in functions like

23
00:01:20.958 --> 00:01:25.180
built in objects,
I thought that could be cool.

24
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.509
Like an array, I could make my array,
and it just extends array and

25
00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.080
I could I could make
the array.push function.

26
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.330
I can make it return the array itself.

27
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.352
So I could daisy chain like, .push, .push,

28
00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:43.860
.push, I could do a bunch of
things like in the in line.

29
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.430
Which might have to do array.push,
blah.push, know what I'm saying?

30
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.990
I could extend and do my own stuff.

31
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.000
Maybe I could use

32
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.780
classes to make something that's
easy to read because, let's face it.

33
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.605
Well I'll get into it, but, so
now I'm actually pretty excited about it.

34
00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:08.371
That count?

35
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:14.510
All right, I don't think the chat's
listening, so let's hurry.

36
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.300
Okay, so the history of classes in ES6.

37
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.056
It goes back to the ES4 days and
we know this,

38
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:22.300
because Adobe's like we're just
gonna implement it on our own.

39
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.480
There's been lots of Churn.

40
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.660
There's lots of precedence in most
other languages to have, like,

41
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.990
a formalized class system and
not prototype inheritance.

42
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.810
So they're sitting there and
they're like, fighting, right?

43
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.210
And we've talked about the big gap and
the fallout.

44
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.350
And it's interesting, Brendan Eich
actually, here's a little tid bit.

45
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.310
I'm going to tell it fast.

46
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.950
I can actually when they fell out and
they couldn't agree

47
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.420
anything it was like a fight he actually
calls that, A Fellowship of the Rings.

48
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.344
Cuz he's like you know how in Fellowship
of the Ring, they're all like,

49
00:02:52.344 --> 00:02:54.777
we're all going to do this together and
then they all go their own way.

50
00:02:54.777 --> 00:02:56.416
Like he's like the it's
the Fellowship of the Ring.

51
00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.320
We all end up breaking up at the end.

52
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.410
And, it's funny,
one thing I didn't tell earlier.

53
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.288
So, the ES3 camps got to give up and
accept the ES4 proposals, right?

54
00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:12.896
Or the other way around the ES4
camp got to give up and

55
00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:18.310
accept like to push the ES4 and
just do the ES3 stuff for now, right.

56
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.510
So that's what happened was,
the ES4 camp as like, cool,

57
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.555
we give up, we'll do the ES3.1 thing for
now, and we'll move on.

58
00:03:25.555 --> 00:03:30.985
So Microsoft is in the don't do ES4,
let's just do the 3.1.

59
00:03:30.985 --> 00:03:35.770
So Allen Wurzbach,
he comes over to Mozilla after that.

60
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.530
He's at Microsoft, goes to Mozilla.

61
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.440
And he's like dude,
we almost gave in to your demands,

62
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.207
we were about to give up,
when you gave up.

63
00:03:47.207 --> 00:03:53.866
So just like if we were like this close
to having all this stuff back in 2008.

64
00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:57.604
But, the cards feel like they fell.

65
00:03:57.604 --> 00:04:00.300
And we're at where we're at today.

66
00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.503
So anyways, so, there's a lot,
and the heart of this conflict is

67
00:04:03.503 --> 00:04:06.494
like this strong type system,
and getting something going.

68
00:04:06.494 --> 00:04:08.811
And they still,
to this day cannot agree on it.

69
00:04:08.811 --> 00:04:12.766
And when they can't agree on something,
remember what I already said when

70
00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:17.374
the TC39, they can't be like, this is how
it works, clearly that's how it works.

71
00:04:17.374 --> 00:04:19.758
What happens?

72
00:04:19.758 --> 00:04:21.450
It gets pushed to the next release, right?

73
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.740
Like so and they were like, it causes were
never going to make it in the ES6, ever.

74
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.210
Okay, like it's not gonna happen.

75
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.409
But then Russell Leggett he
sends us email, on March 19th,

76
00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:38.470
2012 and, he's like hey,
you guys should read this.

77
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.840
It was an excellent email, okay?

78
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.920
And he copies a bunch of code,
off of coffee Scripts' website,

79
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.630
and, he really kind of was like,
hey everyone chill out.

80
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.510
This is what I think we need to do, and

81
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.820
everyone, not immediately because
there's like a lot of discussion.

82
00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.740
If you click on the thread.

83
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.800
This is where the thread starts.

84
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.390
And it was a huge thread that month.

85
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.430
Everyone's in it, and

86
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.620
it's like the big names Brendon and
Russell and Allen and Dave Herman.

87
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.820
Like,epic dudes.

88
00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.050
Anyway, so it was a cool email.

89
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.860
And if you want to, go back and read it.

90
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.240
But this is kind of what he talked about.

91
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.690
He calls it, maximal minimal classes.

92
00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.210
Maximally, I forgot the Y,
Maximally minimal classes.

93
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.630
And he points out the need for
classes like,

94
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.300
dude look we've needed this for so long.

95
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.333
People invented things like Coffee Script,
because we've delayed so long.

96
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:44.481
So, like he kind of points out, there's a
series the people are doing compile to JS

97
00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:48.430
stuff because of it right and
we have like typescript and stuff.

98
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.700
So he points out a strong need for

99
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.520
classes for
something that's not the prototype stuff.

100
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:57.820
And he's like we get, it has to be
enhanceable by future releases.

101
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:06.000
So whatever we do release, it has to be
minimum viable that we can extend, okay?

102
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.069
If anything's not extendable,
we have to cut it.

103
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.220
Or if we're not one 100%
sure on something, it's out.

104
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.710
Everyone's like okay, that's cool.

105
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.887
And he points to Brendan, cuz Brendan's
over there and he's like, hey,

106
00:06:19.887 --> 00:06:20.627
we got this.

107
00:06:20.627 --> 00:06:23.702
He called Brendan's proposal
the Goldilocks proposal,

108
00:06:23.702 --> 00:06:28.360
because he's like you know, it's not too
hot, it's not too cold, it's just right.

109
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.920
And that was Brendan's point of view,
was like, not too much classiness, not

110
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.260
too little classiness, but just the right
amount of class syntax and we're good.

111
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.570
And they could never agree on that.

112
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.590
So he comes up with his
Safety School Proposal.

113
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:44.620
And so the Safety School Proposal,
he's like, in the States,

114
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.180
we have this idea of you
graduate high school, and

115
00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.400
you send off your applications to
the schools that you want to go to, right?

116
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.900
Who did that?

117
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.540
I didn't, but maybe some people did.

118
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.150
And he's like, but then you always
have like the safety school.

119
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.590
So when all other things say no
you have this safety school, and

120
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.260
you can at least go to the safety school.

121
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.170
He's like, that's what we need to
focus on, is the safety school.

122
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.890
He's like, we've got to come up
with the minimum viable product

123
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.470
that we can release.

124
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:18.650
I know you guys want
an Ivy League class system.

125
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.670
But what's the safety
school system look like?

126
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:21.640
What is that one?

127
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.820
And so
that's kind of what he proposes out there.

128
00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.320
And he's like,
if we have to have something ES6.

129
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.690
So what is that.

130
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.010
What's the things we can agree
upon sans the stuff that we can't.

131
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.590
Let's just talk about
what we can agree upon.

132
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.710
And so he wins out.

133
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:41.950
Obviously, I showed you not easily,
it was a real long conversation, but

134
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.210
he did win out.

135
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.620
I mean, people pretty much adopted that
safety school proposal, the maximal and

136
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.690
minimum class system.

137
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.750
And that's what got implemented, was that.

138
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:54.790
So the things we're about to see
are the things everyone agreed on.

139
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:58.790
The things people can't agree on,
we're not gonna see that.

140
00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.730
So everyone's gonna hey
what about the thing and

141
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:05.050
I'm gonna say it's not a thing yet,
it's still being discussed.

142
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.230
And if there was a feature that you
are not gonna see, go ahead and

143
00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.990
call it out and let us know, but
there's a lot of stuff not here.

144
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.860
But I'll try and
show you the stuff that is here
