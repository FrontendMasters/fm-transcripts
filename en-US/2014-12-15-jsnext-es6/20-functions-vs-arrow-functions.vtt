2
00:00:03.847 --> 00:00:06.743
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: You've a question.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It might have been covered

3
00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:11.270
but you say, you can't use
.collar.applied to dynamically set this.

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.530
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: True, you cannot.

5
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.750
Well, you can try to, you will get
an error but it won't do what, when

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.540
you look at it you'll be like, it's gonna
overwrite this and use this as the this,

7
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.810
but it's not going to do that, actually.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Can you-

8
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.490
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: I just wanted to

9
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.140
say this eight times in one sentence.
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: [INAUDIBLE] be like

10
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.810
you found something twice.

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.870
It's gonna take the first value.
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: If you bind it twice?

12
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.450
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: If you said .bind .bind cuz

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.730
The result of a .bind is a function,
so you can bind a .bind, but

14
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.510
it's not gonna take that second-
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: The second

15
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.120
one?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Yeah.

16
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.190
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Same concept here

17
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.220
then, right?
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: Exactly.

18
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.950
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Yeah, so okay, so

19
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.030
someone else asking
a question that I skipped?

20
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.690
I didn't mean to.

21
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.860
If I did, I'm sorry, okay.

22
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.460
Still use functions.

23
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.410
So, let's go back to our widget guy.

24
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.590
And we've got we've got
a function on our net right and

25
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.800
it's a function, we agree?

26
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.949
So what if I,
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: I'm

27
00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:19.307
gonna copy this to the Traceur REPL.

28
00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:30.121
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Can everyone see this

29
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:35.090
okay?
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Everyone

30
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.906
see this code okay?

31
00:01:45.356 --> 00:01:48.174
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Okay, so I'm gonna change

32
00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:55.160
this to be an arrow function instead
of an anonymous function just so

33
00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:03.090
we can see why you still gonna use
function, irregular functions.

34
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.763
So I'm gonna say blah,

35
00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:10.842
wait I'm not gonna say
that I gonna say haha,

36
00:02:10.842 --> 00:02:15.791
okay?
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: I'm actually gonna

37
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:20.150
refresh cuz every time I type it's
adding another bloody click listeners.

38
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.612
I'm actually in a refresher real quick
just to get rid of the freakin' listeners.

39
00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:28.465
Okay, so you guys see what
happened when I clicked the body?

40
00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.866
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: It can't find, undefined,

41
00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:36.880
not a function.

42
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.630
So it's trying to do
something on the this.

43
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.002
So why don't we do this real quick.

44
00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:53.578
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: So what's this?

45
00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:55.468
Window, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46
00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:58.190
So we've got we've now got this new.

47
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.270
We've got this new this that's the window,
okay?

48
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.907
And the reason is because when it was go
through the code ,it was setting this up

49
00:03:08.907 --> 00:03:12.490
and it was okay evaluate that
line evaluate this line, if I,

50
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.270
don't execute it yet
just freaking load it up.

51
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.350
Get this put this on the.

52
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.910
Had to bind this function init to
whatever that this was at this context.

53
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.220
And what's when the page
is loading what's this?

54
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.390
Like when it's just going through and
parsing everything what's this?

55
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.750
It's the Window, right?

56
00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.800
At least in the browser in node it's not
the browser obvious not one, anyway,

57
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.700
so it's the goal, so it's going to bind
all your individual widget functions,

58
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.460
straight to the window, which is stupid.

59
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.800
So yeah that's exactly weird, because the
window doesn't have a do something, and

60
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.660
the widget has to do something still, and

61
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.170
if I change this guy,
to also do it, guess what?

62
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.981
The window now has a do something feature,
okay?

63
00:04:03.981 --> 00:04:06.411
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

64
00:04:06.411 --> 00:04:07.460
&gt;&gt; Aaron Frost: Yeah,

65
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.560
it's still not going to work.

66
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.330
Anyway, my point in what I'm
trying to show you guys is

67
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.230
you're not gonna just replace all
functions with arrow functions.

68
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.720
Otherwise you're going to be
like who did this to my code.

69
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.290
I don't know how to do this anymore so
yeah, just like know what

70
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.767
it is be cool with it, accept it for
what it is and use it where you need it.

71
00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:34.050
Don't I mean anywhere where you would
have said of if var me equals this or

72
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.260
you would have used a bind
you can use this, okay?

73
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.110
And new people coming into JavaScript and
they see this once in a while.

74
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.570
People use this function.

75
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.460
They're going to have to know,

76
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.720
they're going to have to explicitly
learn why they're doing it that way.

77
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.206
Just like he learned, I'm going to
explicitly use function bind and

78
00:04:53.206 --> 00:04:57.083
why I said,
I'm going to use var me equals this,

79
00:04:57.083 --> 00:05:00.222
I'm going to save a reference to this.

80
00:05:00.222 --> 00:05:06.378
Because we had to learn it on the fly and
so people coming in are still going to

81
00:05:06.378 --> 00:05:11.459
need to learn to use when you
want to use a federal function--

82
00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:16.193
an arrow function versus
a regular anonymous function.
