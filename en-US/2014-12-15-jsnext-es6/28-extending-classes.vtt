00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.932
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:05.830
&gt;&gt; Aaron: You can extend it.

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.132
So if we make a monster called Godzilla,
for

4
00:00:09.132 --> 00:00:14.859
him we can just call the super method and
pass in Godzilla and 10,000.

5
00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:19.016
Cuz we all know Godzilla's pretty tough,
right?

6
00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:21.355
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Aaron: So, yeah, so, sorry,

7
00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.490
I'm skipping.

8
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.667
So yeah,
you could totally extend like that.

9
00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.800
Is this something you
could do in prototypes?

10
00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.498
Has anyone ever done anything
like this in prototypes?

11
00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:33.568
Yeah, some of us have.

12
00:00:33.568 --> 00:00:37.540
You can totally do all the things
we just said in prototypes, okay?

13
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.556
So, yeah.

14
00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:49.625
&gt;&gt; Aaron: I just wanted to
point that out real quick,

15
00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:53.250
that this is definitely not a new thing.

16
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.440
This is still sugar.

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.580
The extends expression can
be like a method call.

18
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.646
It's just gonna be evaluated.

19
00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:07.282
So you could say,
class mySocket extends getClass.

20
00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:12.377
And then getClass says, well if I'm IE,
use my IEWebSocket implementation.

21
00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:15.225
[LAUGH] Cuz you know
someone's gonna do it.

22
00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:17.610
And then, otherwise return WebSocket.

23
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.890
What's up?

24
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.359
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Does the declaration have
to be outside the class declaration?

25
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.968
&gt;&gt; Aaron: For?

26
00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:25.771
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: I think he means for
the symbol.

27
00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:27.861
&gt;&gt; Aaron: For the symbol, it has to be,

28
00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:32.385
because if you put it inside
the constructor, I mean okay.

29
00:01:32.385 --> 00:01:34.167
Well, I'm gonna go back to the code,

30
00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:36.588
just because I think I know
what he might be asking.

31
00:01:36.588 --> 00:01:44.566
Okay so in, I'm gonna delete this code
down here just cuz it messes things up.

32
00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:47.590
It just makes it look dirty.

33
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.640
Okay, so in other languages that
have this kind of class syntax,

34
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.920
you have room up top where you
can make a bunch of variables.

35
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.641
So in Java, when you have a class,
your first few lines,

36
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.807
you can put some constants up there,
right?

37
00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:08.888
And [COUGH] Yeah, so I think he's

38
00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:13.790
asking can he say var Monster.

39
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.880
Can he put this in here,
is basically what he's trying to say.

40
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.630
Correct me if I'm wrong.

41
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.469
Is that what he's trying to say?

42
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.300
&gt;&gt; Speaker 3: That's my interpretation.

43
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.170
&gt;&gt; Aaron: Yeah, no, you can't say that.

44
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.422
I should have just said that, but you,

45
00:02:26.422 --> 00:02:29.750
I wanted to make sure I was
understanding what he said.

46
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.240
You can't do that.

47
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.180
Yeah and so,
this actually this brings up a good point.

48
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.240
So this is one of my biggest
gripes about JavaScript.

49
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.298
Who here works with Angular?

50
00:02:39.298 --> 00:02:40.443
Yeah.

51
00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:42.344
So, I'm an Angular guy, and

52
00:02:42.344 --> 00:02:47.024
I'm gonna just ask you to think about
a controller function real quick.

53
00:02:47.024 --> 00:02:53.995
Think, even in the best code, people do,

54
00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:59.910
at the root level of their controller
function, they do code, code, code.

55
00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.650
They declare a function.

56
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.010
More code, code, code.

57
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.290
More function, more function, code, code.

58
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.970
It's like, who wrote this?

59
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.510
Who ever thought that that was
an okay way to write code?

60
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.180
The fact that you can write code at root
level makes me just wanna stab myself.

61
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.085
And so I really like that in classes,
you can't do that.

62
00:03:21.085 --> 00:03:22.339
I like that in classes here,

63
00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:24.756
it kinda takes the,
there's no root level code here.

64
00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:27.090
You have to put it all inside of a method.

65
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.000
That's how we did it in other languages,
and it worked great, right?

66
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.218
And so I really like that it is bringing
a little bit of structure back into our

67
00:03:33.218 --> 00:03:35.650
code, not letting us just
pepper it in wherever we want.

68
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.620
I think this is a good thing.

69
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.120
So, yeah.

70
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.730
Yeah, anyway.

71
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.220
But you cannot do what that guy wants
to do, so, at least that I know of.

72
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.160
And that's just today.

73
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.770
The spec could change, so yeah.

74
00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.330
Yeah, so again, the class when you extend
something, that could even be dynamic.

75
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.630
That can change per browser.

76
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:07.502
So you can say MySocket extends getClass,
and the getClass says, hey man,

77
00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:10.105
if I'm in IE, return this other class.

78
00:04:10.105 --> 00:04:12.819
Otherwise, just use the web socket,
native web socket.

79
00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:19.090
And so, yeah, does that sound like fun?

80
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.840
But you could do it.

81
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.040
That's the thing that you could do,
you don't have to do.
