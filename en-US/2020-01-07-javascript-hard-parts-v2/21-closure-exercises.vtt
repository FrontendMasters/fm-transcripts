00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.190
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: You know what?
It is pair programming, it's time,

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.680
we're taking this very nicely paced,
it's wonderful,

3
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.920
we're gonna do some pair programming,
folks.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.190
I think at this point,
get back back with your same partners,

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.050
go to csbin.io/closures and
you're gonna see what we did here, and

6
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.530
you're gonna start to see a whole
bunch of closure challenges.

7
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.530
Right after a 20 minute
pair programming session,

8
00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.430
we're gonna come back together and
we're gonna see how closure works

9
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.180
under the hood and
we're talking lexical scoping.

10
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.700
I'm going to tell you the one five letter
word, not a word five, word phrase that

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.880
will, I'm not to make this joke anymore
because somebody apparently was upset that

12
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.105
it definitely did not get them a senior
developer job for knowing this phrase.

13
00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.860
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So but if you know

14
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.790
this phrase, you will get a senior
developer job like that, I want to promise

15
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.780
you right now you say those five words,
you're gonna see it in another country.

16
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.170
All right, back to pair programming.
