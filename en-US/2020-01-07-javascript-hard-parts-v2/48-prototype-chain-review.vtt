00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.210
&gt;&gt; Will Sentance: So to summarize solution
two back to the core of the goal here.

2
00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.385
Like I gave those bonus pieces there for
all of us just, intriguing things.

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.340
Using the prototype chain,
using JavaScript prototype or

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.060
feature that user one and user two,

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.240
go access from when they were
created inside of user creator

6
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.680
with the order to create which gave their
object a bond to use a function store.

7
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.347
When I ran user one.increment and
did not find it,

8
00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:35.060
the increment functionality of user one,
did I panic?

9
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.140
No, I headed up the proto reference
at the prototype chain to the user

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.811
function store where I found increment,
and I run it, problems with this?

11
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:48.650
No problems, it's beautiful.

12
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.050
It's a sort of Star Wars with you in
your interview said to your interviewer,

13
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.350
I prefer because I want more fine
grained control over my writing of my

14
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.160
oxygen that I tend to try and
follow this approach.

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.680
And they're gonna go,
they're gonna think the worst.

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.220
But, at the same time,
they're gonna go, impressive.

17
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.480
I better say I agree.

18
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.405
They're gonna go, yes, me too, yes.

19
00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:22.380
They're not saying is the right way,
it's certainly not standard.

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.570
And I would not be
suggesting you use this but

21
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.600
it's gonna turn out to be the answer
to what's really happening

22
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.790
when we do use the standard way
of achieving this same goal.

23
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.610
Cuz the standard way, solution three and
four, increasingly just solution four,

24
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.980
behind the scenes is doing all this here.

25
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.680
And that means if you've gotta debug,
you've gotta understand it.

26
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.860
That means if you wanna interview and
answer the question what's the new keyword

27
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.860
actually doing behind the scenes,
you got to know all this stuff.

28
00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.630
And I will say this, if you're writing,

29
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.110
if once you start thinking in this
paradigm in this way of thinking,

30
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.520
you start structuring everything
you do as object containing

31
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.320
the data that's pertinent to that feature
and its associated functionality.

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.790
You solving have users and admins,
and moderators, and quiz questions,

33
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.970
and league tables, and
even the game application itself.

34
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.200
All is just a collection of
data associated with that but

35
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.890
even the game board,

36
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.620
the dimensions of the game board and then
functionality related to that game board.

37
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.670
I use something for
everything in this way.

38
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.480
So you start writing a lot of these
functions that produce an object,

39
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.650
sometimes just one object with
just a sort of functions and

40
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.790
you only ever have one of them,
you just think in this manner from now on.

41
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.430
So I guess if you're always creating
a little object inside, always making your

42
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.920
connection to a store of functions, always
returning that object out like, I guess it

43
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.700
might be nice to have a way of saving
yourself during that process every time.

44
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.940
But it is super sophisticated this way,
but it isn't standard.

45
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.790
So we're now gonna see in solution
three the more standard way

46
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.120
introducing the keyword, they're all
that makes the hard work, its new.
