00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.350
So, what to do next?

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.261
If you are excited, you're really looking
forward to getting started with Gatsby you

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.820
wanna go build something.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.000
There are a few things that you can do.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.750
First and foremost,
we've got another course coming up.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.410
We're gonna do an intermediate gatsby
course on Friday that's two days from now.

7
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.800
That will also be turned into
a front end masters workshop course.

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.430
So, if you wanna go deeper, come back,
take the intermediate gatsby course.

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.460
You can check out the docs gatsby is has
a tone of doc's at gatsbyjs.com/docs,

10
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.860
there is a full on tutorial,
like a zero to up and running.

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.631
There are, lots of conceptual guides,
on routing, on images,

12
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:51.410
on data sourcing, on plugins,
all the things that we talked about today.

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.590
You go much deeper in the docs, and then
they have API references for all of that.

14
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.908
Now, the docs have started to sprawl a
little bit, so it can be a little tricky,

15
00:00:59.908 --> 00:01:02.550
and you may have noticed
me kinda googling around

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.470
trying to find the thing
that I was looking for.

17
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.020
So don't get discouraged if you
have a little bit of trouble.

18
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.460
There's a lot of information
about gatsby in there.

19
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.940
Keep googling, you'll find it I promise.

20
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.900
You can also Just get out there and
publish something.

21
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.971
The best way to learn something is
to get reps, use the tool, put it

22
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:25.625
on the internet, get that thing live,
just have an idea have a silly idea and

23
00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:28.650
put it up on the internet so
that people can play.

24
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.290
Good example this like I wanted to make
fun of my my coworker Phil Hawksworth.

25
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.811
And so I bought a domain and
like edited his head onto

26
00:01:38.811 --> 00:01:44.220
an animated GIF and
then I just like put this together.

27
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.075
Like I just wanted to make
it a goofy thing to share.

28
00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:53.460
I built this in probably 10 minutes and
I put it on the internet because

29
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.274
there's nothing more fun than
hitting that Publish button.

30
00:01:57.274 --> 00:02:01.986
And being able to share a bad idea that
you've had I also like built a little

31
00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:02.907
goofy thing.

32
00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:07.941
This is a gatsby site that just
like lets you put anything,

33
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:13.714
it breaks all the links so whenever
you try to click a link on a page.

34
00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:18.310
It uses the goose sound from
the untitled goose game.

35
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.670
This is another like bad idea
project I built it in like an hour.

36
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.610
And I just put it on the internet
because it made me smile.

37
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.591
So if you are trying to
decide what you should

38
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:35.000
build don't let a lack
of a good idea stop you.

39
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.230
This was a terrible idea but
it was still fun to publish,

40
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.420
it was fun to put it out there.

41
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.733
And playing as a means of learning is one
of the best ways to make it stick and

42
00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.460
it's one of the best
ways to lower the stakes.

43
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.960
You wanna get out there and
just try things, see what you can build,

44
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.370
see what you can get done,
put a time box on it.

45
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.020
How much can I get done in an hour?

46
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.730
What can I publish in an hour?

47
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.407
And then actually put it on the internet,
share it with friends,

48
00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:02.900
show people your bad ideas,
because then you get feedback.

49
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.470
People will tell you what they like,
what they wanted to see instead,

50
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.950
they'll give you an idea for
your next bad website.

51
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.980
And then you can just keep playing.

52
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.198
And the more you play, the more you learn,
the more you can do and the more likely

53
00:03:13.198 --> 00:03:16.990
you are to be able to accomplish whatever
gets thrown at you and your normal work.

54
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.410
So, I hope that that you all
go out there and get excited.

55
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.640
Start playing with Gatsby and
put some stuff out on the internet.

56
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.304
Please, send me something on Twitter,
if you have questions but

57
00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:30.380
I'd also love to see what you build.

58
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.010
So if you're out there, if you're
building stuff, tag me when you share it,

59
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.540
I wanna see it, I wanna take a look.

60
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.580
That's it for me, I have had a blast
today, I hope you've had a lot of fun.

61
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.451
I hope you learned a lot and

62
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:44.440
I hope you're excited to go out there and
build something.
