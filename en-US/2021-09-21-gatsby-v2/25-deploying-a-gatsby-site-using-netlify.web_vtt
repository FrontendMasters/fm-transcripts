1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.710
Speaking of building the site,
let's get this thing up and built, yeah.

2
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.820
So I've already pushed
everything up to GitHub.

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.740
And what I wanna do now is I
want to initialize a new site.

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.098
So I'm going to use netlify today,
I worked for netlify.

5
00:00:21.098 --> 00:00:24.641
So that that influences my decisions,
but even before I worked for

6
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:28.056
nullify it was the place that I
would deploy because it's just so

7
00:00:28.056 --> 00:00:31.070
much easier than other
tools that I've used.

8
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.442
So actually, let me pull up,
me open a window with my own profile so

9
00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.930
that I can actually get
logged into things here.

10
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.408
It's what I use for all of my sites and

11
00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:45.540
what we're gonna be using
specifically today.

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:53.430
Is the netlify COI because it's just very
good, like it just makes my life easier.

13
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.664
So the same way that I
used the the GitHub COI,

14
00:00:57.664 --> 00:01:04.352
I'm going to use the netlify COI so
to do that you can install it globally

15
00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:09.720
with NPM i dash g netlify COI I
already have it installed.

16
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.024
But if you look at it,

17
00:01:11.024 --> 00:01:15.521
what you're gonna see is I'm using
the Netlify CLI version 6.1.0,

18
00:01:15.521 --> 00:01:20.234
if you already have it installed, make
sure you install the latest version so

19
00:01:20.234 --> 00:01:24.680
that you are able too get all the benefits
of what we're about to do here.

20
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.639
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to looking at this and

21
00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:32.195
see there's no like Netlify
specific files here.

22
00:01:32.195 --> 00:01:36.330
So let me run Netlify in it,
all right, I guess I'll log in first.

23
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.320
So netlify login, and it's gonna
show me that I'm already logged in.

24
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.339
If I wasn't, it would take me to
the Netlify site and just say like, hey,

25
00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:46.030
do you want to allow this to work and
it would say yes.

26
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.140
And you can make sure that you're
logged in by running Netlify status.

27
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.614
I'm using MTL, which is a shorthand,

28
00:01:53.614 --> 00:01:57.260
you can also run like
Netlify status like this.

29
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.780
Whichever one you prefer.

30
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.150
What I wanna do is run Netlify in it and
this is going to give me options.

31
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.405
I can either connect it to
an existing site, or I can create and

32
00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:15.050
configure a new one I wanna create,
create and configure a new site.

33
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.460
So I'm gonna hit Enter, and
then it's gonna ask me which team I want.

34
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.340
If you only have one team,
this will be a much simpler selection.

35
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.554
I am on a million teams,
I will choose my own site and

36
00:02:26.554 --> 00:02:29.600
then I want to, let's do front end.

37
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.735
Masters, intro to Gatsby v2, that's
probably, that's probably unique name.

38
00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:41.969
So I've named the site,
that's what the URL will be, and

39
00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:45.533
you can see that here, how it's now set,
that'll be the URL for

40
00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:48.605
the site unless I put
a custom domain on it.

41
00:02:48.605 --> 00:02:53.042
And because it can tell that this is a
Gatsby site It's telling us it's going to

42
00:02:53.042 --> 00:02:54.130
use Gatsby build.

43
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.876
All right, I'll use that default,

44
00:02:55.876 --> 00:02:59.590
it knows that Gatsby has a public
folder great use that default.

45
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.860
We didn't use any Netlify function so
we can just move on past that.

46
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.540
But then here's the other cool thing
is because this is a Gatsby site.

47
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.170
It's gonna use this
essential Gatsby plugin.

48
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.672
And earlier when I was talking
about the keeping the cache and and

49
00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:17.910
doing stuff to just make Gatsby
run a little bit better.

50
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.750
That's what this Gatsby plugin does.

51
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.999
So all of that and

52
00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:27.200
then I can add this Netlify dot Tama
which keeps all those settings Okay.

53
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.798
Now there's one thing
that is different about

54
00:03:29.798 --> 00:03:33.260
this setup than what you will
do if you're on the main branch,

55
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.330
which most of you, I think will be if
you've been building against this rebuild.

56
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.370
Then everything's gonna just work.

57
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.830
On my end because I just changed
the site to use the progress branch,

58
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.421
I have to go into here to site settings.

59
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:52.117
And I'm going to change the default branch

60
00:03:52.117 --> 00:03:57.079
here to progress cuz I
wanted to use that one.

61
00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:59.270
So then I'm going to go to my deploy and

62
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.150
cancel that one because
that's on the wrong branch.

63
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.612
And then I'm going to trigger anyone.

64
00:04:13.433 --> 00:04:16.240
And so we can see that it is building.

65
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.500
This pulls in all the containers and

66
00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.750
things that we would need
to actually run the site.

67
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.870
So it's installing node and
downloading the NPM modules and all that.

68
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.536
This is the first time that we're
building the site so there's no cache,

69
00:04:31.536 --> 00:04:33.310
which means this one will
be a little bit slower.

70
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.351
And a couple of things to note because
we added that end VMRC it automatically

71
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.940
picked up on the node version
that we wanted to use.

72
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.653
It's also going to install
these plugins here, let's see.

73
00:04:55.957 --> 00:05:00.910
It goes with the initial NPM install
which, again, Gatsby has a lot going on.

74
00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.900
So the initial install of
Gatsby takes a little bit.

75
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.440
All right, so now we've got all
the dependencies we're actually building.

76
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.430
And you can see here that it's got this,
this Gatsby plugin installing.

77
00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.200
And because it's the first build,
there's no Gatsby cache.

78
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.130
So it's running building fresh.

79
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.900
I am not using any of the redirects,
but there is an extra plugin.

80
00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.444
If we wanted to add Gatsby redirects,

81
00:05:27.444 --> 00:05:32.720
then the Gatsby site is gonna build
the way that we are building.

82
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.628
And this is different than no different
from any other way that you would build

83
00:05:35.628 --> 00:05:37.050
a Gatsby site.

84
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.503
Just running the Gatsby build command.

85
00:05:43.472 --> 00:05:45.543
And we got an error.

86
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.882
Cannot read Gatsby image data of no,

87
00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:57.760
Distributed databases on the jam stack.

88
00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.700
So apparently one of
our images is missing.

89
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.980
Well that's okay, we can fix that.

90
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.971
Let's go right in here and say If,

91
00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:12.651
are we in the let's get into episode and

92
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:16.971
we can say episode dot image.

93
00:06:23.532 --> 00:06:26.870
And we'll just do optional
chaining to get to it.

94
00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:39.140
Okay, so something's wrong with
the data in my site that's not Gatsby,

95
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.370
that's my data entry.

96
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.321
So let's add everything get commit and

97
00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:50.980
we'll say fix handle missing data.

98
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.825
Let's push that up and
now that we've configured the site,

99
00:06:56.825 --> 00:07:00.069
what's nice is it'll
automatically start this rebuild.

100
00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:00.772
So here goes.

101
00:07:00.772 --> 00:07:05.050
&gt;&gt; One example I want.

102
00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:12.110
For example, I want to,
to display a different,

103
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:20.480
cropped image in different
resolution preservation.

104
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:25.914
So how can I,
how can I benefit from Gatsby and

105
00:07:25.914 --> 00:07:33.500
work with different images
cropped in different resolution?

106
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.402
&gt;&gt; I mean, the short answer is if you're
going to spend more time working around

107
00:07:40.402 --> 00:07:42.888
it, then you would just do it on your own.

108
00:07:42.888 --> 00:07:47.224
I think if you've got a very like,
specific thing you're trying to build,

109
00:07:47.224 --> 00:07:49.850
it's easier to just build that.

110
00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:54.805
So yeah, I think the ultimately
II would say you probably if you

111
00:07:54.805 --> 00:07:59.760
want to control the picture,
just optimize your own images and

112
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.703
drop them in and
don't worry about Gatsby at all.

113
00:08:03.703 --> 00:08:09.391
Because it's gonna fight you and try to
create each image as its own picture,

114
00:08:09.391 --> 00:08:12.930
so yeah,
it would just be easier not use it.

115
00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:14.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

116
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:20.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course, and so
now the site is built, the site is live.

117
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:24.359
Anybody can go and
visit this now it's on the Internet at

118
00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:28.488
the front end masters intro
to Gatsby v2.Netlify.app.

119
00:08:28.488 --> 00:08:33.357
And all of these things that we wanted
to use are there working and running,

120
00:08:33.357 --> 00:08:37.500
you can get in there and
mess with them right now.

121
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.172
So this is a very straightforward
way to get things done and

122
00:08:43.172 --> 00:08:49.885
it's nice and fast so this first one
on fresh build was two minutes and

123
00:08:49.885 --> 00:08:54.550
51 seconds and that built 220 pages or so.

124
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.620
Including the because it built
the schedule pages as well.

125
00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.213
And that is pretty neat, so

126
00:09:03.213 --> 00:09:08.069
then if we wanna go and make a change.

127
00:09:12.298 --> 00:09:14.340
And add new information, right?

128
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.698
And then I will commit everything and

129
00:09:18.698 --> 00:09:24.890
we'll just say add some new markup oops,
get push.

130
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.830
And because things are cached,
the site's gonna build a lot faster.

131
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:36.613
Now this is a feature of Gatsby three,
where they've basically made the cache

132
00:09:36.613 --> 00:09:41.629
more intelligent, and they don't rebuild
pages that don't need to be rebuilt.

133
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.232
So what we'll see is that we've
already got node installed,

134
00:09:46.232 --> 00:09:48.600
we've already got the node modules.

135
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:54.460
We've got a Gatsby cache here so we can
rely on that and move a lot more quickly.

136
00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:00.740
So the Gatsby build should take like
closer to 15 seconds instead of a minute.

137
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.700
So it's one of those things where
keeping the cash around and

138
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:10.280
not cleaning things out is
gonna make a big difference.

139
00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.341
Yeah, 19 seconds to build
the site that time, so

140
00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:16.780
it gets much faster as you
keep that cash around.

141
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:17.800
I see a question?

142
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.430
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to deploy on
Netlify without it on address?

143
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.990
&gt;&gt; Meaning like,
is there a way to deploy to Netlify

144
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.915
without creating the .Netlify.app URL.

145
00:10:33.915 --> 00:10:37.614
This is done, so
that you can review your work,

146
00:10:37.614 --> 00:10:42.328
if you wanted to add a custom,
what you would do if you didn't

147
00:10:42.328 --> 00:10:46.680
want the netlify.app is you
would add your own domain.

148
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.070
So if you've got a domain name that you
wanna use, you would add that on top.

149
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.970
And then this will redirect
to your custom domain name.

150
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:00.954
If you wanted to deploy to Netlify in

151
00:11:00.954 --> 00:11:06.270
a way that nobody can access I think you

152
00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:11.253
can set it to be like you need to enter

153
00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:17.402
a password to see it
that maybe that's a paid

154
00:11:17.402 --> 00:11:23.010
feature actually access control.

155
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:23.880
Can I set a password?

156
00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.374
I think this might be, so
I have all the features,

157
00:11:32.374 --> 00:11:36.857
so this one might be a thing,
but if I set like.

158
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:43.850
By set a password and I'll show you, so
that you can get in after I do this.

159
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.955
If I set a password and
then I go over here and

160
00:11:46.955 --> 00:11:50.925
I try to load It's gonna say
that it wants a password and

161
00:11:50.925 --> 00:11:55.520
I have to put that in, so
that's one way to solve that problem.

162
00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:02.150
I'm gonna turn that off, so
that there's no password required.

163
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:09.867
But yeah, I don't, if that's not
what you're asking then I'm not,

164
00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:12.237
can you rephrase the question?

165
00:12:12.237 --> 00:12:14.148
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]
&gt;&gt; Okay?

166
00:12:16.758 --> 00:12:19.890
Yeah, it is an example of
custom domains like this.

167
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.432
This is my personal site,
this is deployed in LFI, but

168
00:12:23.432 --> 00:12:28.517
I bought the domain jason.af, and so
I just use that as the root domain for it.

169
00:12:31.417 --> 00:12:33.055
Any other questions?

170
00:12:33.055 --> 00:12:38.595
&gt;&gt; Okay, occurring in the E-commerce
website with Gatsby for

171
00:12:38.595 --> 00:12:42.938
example, I really do,
but I would make login,

172
00:12:42.938 --> 00:12:47.080
user can log in, log out,
and add products.

173
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:56.440
And buy products like this product,
I can do it with Gadsby?

174
00:12:56.440 --> 00:13:00.197
&gt;&gt; Sure, Gatsby does support we'll
talk a little bit more about like

175
00:13:00.197 --> 00:13:03.430
client only routes and
how you would do authentication.

176
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:07.260
We won't actually do authentication, but
we'll show you what the process would be.

177
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:13.841
In the intermediate workshop
on in a couple of days, but

178
00:13:13.841 --> 00:13:20.010
what you can do in the meantime
is is it store Gatsby.

179
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:28.262
Yeah, so this this is an E-commerce
store built on Gatsby,

180
00:13:28.262 --> 00:13:33.460
I went back when I was there,
we put this together.

181
00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.820
And this is pulling data from Shopify.

182
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:41.527
So Shopify data comes in all
the images and product prices that

183
00:13:41.527 --> 00:13:46.990
are in everything are managed in Shopify,
and then you can add those to your cart.

184
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:52.195
And when you go to checkout, we rely
on the Shopify checkout because all

185
00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:57.679
the different compliance and
address management shipping calculation.

186
00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:00.915
All that stuff is a huge pain
that I don't wanna deal with, so

187
00:14:00.915 --> 00:14:03.140
we just outsource that right to Shopify.

188
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:09.610
Stripe has a similar flow, where it
will let you manage all those things.

189
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:15.321
But then what we also did with
the Gatsby swag is we set it up,

190
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:21.378
that if you are a Gatsby contributor,
which we use auth zero for

191
00:14:21.378 --> 00:14:25.720
this, you log in with
your GitHub account and

192
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:29.290
then once it redirects, here we go.

193
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.787
We check for whether or
not you are a contributor, and

194
00:14:34.787 --> 00:14:40.200
if you are, we check whether or
not you've claimed your swag.

195
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.997
So there's a swag code
here that I've claimed,

196
00:14:42.997 --> 00:14:46.060
and these swag codes are tied
to your user account.

197
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:51.129
So the fact that I'm showing this doesn't
matter because unless you have my

198
00:14:51.129 --> 00:14:57.210
Shopify login, my email and address it
won't, it won't actually let you order.

199
00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:03.026
So this is like a user authenticated
E-commerce experience built in Gatsby and

200
00:15:03.026 --> 00:15:05.240
this is also open source.

201
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.680
So if you wanna see the source code for
this, you can find it.

202
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:14.915
On GitHub at the Gatsby js org store that

203
00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:19.842
Gatsby js.org is the repo for this.

204
00:15:19.842 --> 00:15:27.440
&gt;&gt; We will do a quantification
in the intermediate workshop.

205
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:30.700
&gt;&gt; We're not gonna do like
full on authentication.

206
00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:35.880
If you wannao see how off works,
I would look at this, this repo.

207
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.870
&gt;&gt; Okay?

208
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:41.619
&gt;&gt; Because honestly, authentication it
is big enough to be its own course,

209
00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:44.350
if we really dig into all
the things you can do with it.
