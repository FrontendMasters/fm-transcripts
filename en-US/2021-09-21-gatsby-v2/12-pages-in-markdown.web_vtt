1
00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.445
Let's recap, okay?

2
00:00:01.445 --> 00:00:05.874
Let's recap where we were, and get a sense
of what we've accomplished so far.

3
00:00:05.874 --> 00:00:11.214
So, as of right now,
what we have done is we have taken

4
00:00:11.214 --> 00:00:16.440
our site from the simplest
possible implementation

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.278
where we had just an index page
in our source pages folder.

6
00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:26.503
Which is the, smallest possible
implementation of a Gatsby site.

7
00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:32.411
We took that, added in links,
added any additional pages.

8
00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:37.946
We got site metadata in built an SEO tag,
got a shared layout,

9
00:00:37.946 --> 00:00:43.063
added some global styles,
got some some scoped styles.

10
00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:44.628
We're in pretty solid shape here.

11
00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.484
We're building a site right?

12
00:00:46.484 --> 00:00:49.487
At this point what we've done
is we've effectively made it so

13
00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:52.836
that if we needed to get something
stood up and out into the internet,

14
00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.111
we've got all of
the components to get there.

15
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:59.806
But there's some things that we can
do from here to give ourselves more

16
00:00:59.806 --> 00:01:04.265
flexibility and more capability in
the way that we create pages and

17
00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:07.624
in the way that we work
with data inside of Gatsby.

18
00:01:07.624 --> 00:01:11.584
So, what we're gonna do next
is we are going to jump in and

19
00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:14.563
start playing with something called MDX.

20
00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:19.142
So, a common approach for
writing content is markdown.

21
00:01:19.142 --> 00:01:23.120
And if you've ever worked with
the GitHub README, you've seen markdown.

22
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.478
It's the idea that you create
a heading with one pound sign and

23
00:01:28.478 --> 00:01:31.683
then you double it up that's an h2.

24
00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:37.963
If you wanna do link, you say your link
text and then you link to something.

25
00:01:37.963 --> 00:01:42.072
So, in markdown, you've got,
a heading like this.

26
00:01:42.072 --> 00:01:46.682
You can do text like this,
you wanna do a bulleted

27
00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:51.303
list you can do list 1,
2, this sort of thing.

28
00:01:51.303 --> 00:01:55.982
And this is a really nice way to write
when you are trying to get some content

29
00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:56.750
together.

30
00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.923
You don't wanna think a lot about markup,
you don't want to have to write

31
00:02:00.923 --> 00:02:04.842
your opening paragraph tags and
all the Li tags and things like that.

32
00:02:04.842 --> 00:02:07.036
That can get really cumbersome
when you're trying to write.

33
00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:10.662
So around Blogging,
documentation, things like that.

34
00:02:10.662 --> 00:02:12.410
It's nice to have this markdown format.

35
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.272
But the challenge with markdown
is that it is limited.

36
00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:22.239
So the way that we write markdown,
it kinda puts us in this position

37
00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.044
where it's either all content or
we're writing custom stuff.

38
00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:31.907
So if I wanted to, for
example add a figure to my mark down

39
00:02:31.907 --> 00:02:37.093
there's no way for
me to mark up a figure like this, right?

40
00:02:37.093 --> 00:02:41.629
So I'm gonna end up I've got my, image and

41
00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:48.312
this has got whatever images this and,
it's like some image.

42
00:02:48.312 --> 00:02:54.443
And then I want to add a caption so
I've got my fake caption.

43
00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:58.352
And when you do this,
this is kind of a pain in

44
00:02:58.352 --> 00:03:03.133
markdown because it first
of all it breaks your flow.

45
00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.580
You're not thinking about content anymore.

46
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.410
Now you're thinking about markup.

47
00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.163
And then imagine this
gets more like involved.

48
00:03:10.163 --> 00:03:14.748
We've got some shareable component
which is like a post image.

49
00:03:14.748 --> 00:03:18.373
Where we wanna add some styling to this so
that you can add captions.

50
00:03:18.373 --> 00:03:22.623
And maybe in here you actually want
this to have like a caption and

51
00:03:22.623 --> 00:03:27.991
then in addition to the caption, you also
want to have your like, photo credit.

52
00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:33.203
And in your photo credit,
you want to be able to set,

53
00:03:33.203 --> 00:03:36.840
like, credit is to whoever.

54
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.773
And so
now all of a sudden you've got like,

55
00:03:38.773 --> 00:03:42.291
there's a lot you've got to remember and
if I were to be trying to write this.

56
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:46.127
There's a pretty low likelihood that I'm
going to remember all the class names

57
00:03:46.127 --> 00:03:47.053
the exact markup.

58
00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:51.639
So now when I'm writing my markdown, I end
up having to come in and I got to find one

59
00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.702
of these, I got to copy it, I got to
paste it into my document down here.

60
00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.933
And then I got to edit all these fields.

61
00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:02.742
So it's switching from
content creation to markup.

62
00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:07.613
And that's a little bit challenging
when you're trying to stay in the flow

63
00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:08.472
as a writer.

64
00:04:08.472 --> 00:04:13.061
And that's why MDX is exciting
because what MDX is letting us do is

65
00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:17.987
it's letting us kind of componentize
that additional functionality

66
00:04:17.987 --> 00:04:21.255
if we want to bring in
a react component we can.

67
00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:24.008
And that way we are mostly
writing markdown.

68
00:04:24.008 --> 00:04:28.801
But if we decide that we want to bring in,
some react, we can.

69
00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:33.627
And that lets us build sort of like if
you if you've ever worked with WordPress,

70
00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:37.821
a good example this is shortcodes
very use short codes in WordPress.

71
00:04:37.821 --> 00:04:43.119
It's really nice to be able to
turn on the short codes and

72
00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:47.424
just know that your
content is going to work.

73
00:04:47.424 --> 00:04:50.514
And you don't have to remember
how the markup works or

74
00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:55.470
any of those things, you just wrap it in,
we would just go, I want to do a figure.

75
00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.419
My figures gonna have a source of like,

76
00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:09.005
image and an alt and
then we could put in a caption.

77
00:05:09.005 --> 00:05:14.552
This is way easier to remember
than we exact markup, right?

78
00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:18.724
So, this is a little more
powerful of an approach.

79
00:05:18.724 --> 00:05:22.022
And, it lets me stay in
the flow of working,

80
00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:26.760
of writing without having to,
go find some copy to copy paste.
