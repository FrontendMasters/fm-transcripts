00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.475
Let's recap, okay?

2
00:00:01.475 --> 00:00:05.952
Let's recap where we were, and get a sense
of what we've accomplished so far.

3
00:00:05.952 --> 00:00:10.977
So, as of right now,
what we have done is we have taken

4
00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:16.134
our site from the simplest
possible implementation.

5
00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:21.113
Where we had a just an index
page in our source pages folder,

6
00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:26.603
which is the smallest possible
implementation of a Gatsby site.

7
00:00:26.603 --> 00:00:32.488
We took that added in links,
added it into additional pages.

8
00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:37.332
We got site metadata in, built in SEO tag.

9
00:00:37.332 --> 00:00:43.178
Got a shared layout, added some global
styles, got some scoped styles.

10
00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:46.682
We're in pretty solid shape here,
we're building a site, right?

11
00:00:46.682 --> 00:00:49.257
At this point what we've done
is we've effectively made it, so

12
00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:52.179
that if we needed to get something
stored up and added into the internet.

13
00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.262
We've got all of
the components to get there.

14
00:00:55.262 --> 00:00:59.591
But there's some things that we
can do from here to give ourselves

15
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:04.247
more flexibility and more capability
in the way that we create pages.

16
00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:07.817
In the way that we work
with data inside of Gatsby.

17
00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:11.712
So what we're gonna do next is
we are going to jump in and

18
00:01:11.712 --> 00:01:14.771
start playing with something called MDX.

19
00:01:14.771 --> 00:01:19.290
So, a common approach for
writing content is Markdown.

20
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.082
And if you've ever worked with
the GitHub README, you've seen Markdown.

21
00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:28.529
It's the idea that you create
a heading with one pound sign and

22
00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:31.796
then you double it up that's an H2.

23
00:01:31.796 --> 00:01:38.044
If you wanna do link, you say your link
text and then you link to something.

24
00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:44.141
So, in Markdown, you've got a heading
like this, you can do text like this.

25
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:51.322
You wanna do a bulleted list, you can
do list one, two, this sort of thing.

26
00:01:51.322 --> 00:01:54.673
And this is a really nice way to
write when you are trying to get

27
00:01:54.673 --> 00:01:58.445
some content together,
you don't wanna think a lot about markup.

28
00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:02.558
You don't want to have to write
your opening paragraph tags and

29
00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:04.973
all the LI tags and things like that.

30
00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:07.189
That can get really cumbersome
when you're trying to write.

31
00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.750
So, blogging, documentation,
things like that.

32
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.354
It's nice to have this Markdown format.

33
00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:17.329
But the challenge with Markdown
is that it is limited.

34
00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.272
So the way that we write Markdown,
it kinda puts us in this position

35
00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:27.060
where it's either all content or
we're writing custom stuff.

36
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.172
So if I wanted to, for example,
add a figure to my Markdown,

37
00:02:32.172 --> 00:02:37.204
there's no way for
me to mark up a figure like this, right?

38
00:02:37.204 --> 00:02:40.042
So I'm gonna end up, I've got my image.

39
00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:46.592
And this has got whatever images, This and

40
00:02:46.592 --> 00:02:51.729
it's some image and then,
I wanna add a caption so

41
00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:57.884
I've got my fake caption,
and When you do this,

42
00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:03.362
this is kind of a pain in Markdown because
it first of all it breaks your flow.

43
00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:05.766
You're not thinking about content anymore.

44
00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.303
Now you're thinking about markup.

45
00:03:07.303 --> 00:03:10.300
And then imagine this gets more involved.

46
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.108
We've got some shareable component,
which is like a post image,

47
00:03:14.108 --> 00:03:17.996
where we wanna add some styling to this so
that you can add captions.

48
00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:22.595
And maybe in here you actually want
this to have like a caption and

49
00:03:22.595 --> 00:03:28.142
then in addition to the caption, you
also wanna have your like photo credit.

50
00:03:28.142 --> 00:03:33.688
And in your photo credit
you want to be able to set,

51
00:03:33.688 --> 00:03:36.736
like credit is to whoever.

52
00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:40.687
And so now all of a sudden you've got like
there's a lot you've got to remember and

53
00:03:40.687 --> 00:03:44.464
if I were to be trying to write this,
there's a pretty low likelihood that I'm

54
00:03:44.464 --> 00:03:47.172
going to remember all the class
names the exact markup.

55
00:03:47.172 --> 00:03:51.726
So now when I'm writing my Markdown I end
up having to come in and I got to find one

56
00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:55.935
of these I got to copy it, I got to
paste it into my document down here, and

57
00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:58.015
then I got to edit all these fields.

58
00:03:58.015 --> 00:04:02.891
So it's switching from
content creation to markup.

59
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:07.763
And that's a little bit challenging
when you're trying to stay in the flow

60
00:04:07.763 --> 00:04:08.623
as a writer.

61
00:04:08.623 --> 00:04:10.657
And that's why MDX is exciting,

62
00:04:10.657 --> 00:04:15.015
because what MDX is letting us do is
it's letting us kinda componentize

63
00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:19.751
that additional functionality if we
wanna bring in a react component we can.

64
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:23.966
And that way we are mostly
writing Markdown but

65
00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:28.951
if we decide that we wanna
bring in some react, we can.

66
00:04:28.951 --> 00:04:33.141
And that lets us build sort of like
if you've ever worked with WordPress,

67
00:04:33.141 --> 00:04:37.483
a good example this is shortcodes,
f you ever use shortcodes in WordPress.

68
00:04:37.483 --> 00:04:43.171
It's really nice to be able
to turn on the shortcodes and

69
00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:47.538
just know that your content is gonna work.

70
00:04:47.538 --> 00:04:52.554
And you don't have to remember how
the markup works or any of those things,

71
00:04:52.554 --> 00:04:56.531
you just wrap it,
we would just go I wanna do a figure and

72
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:00.530
my figures gonna have a source of like,
image, whatever.

73
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.510
And an alt of whatever and
then we could put in a caption and

74
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:14.494
a credit, like this is way easier to
remember then we exact markup, right?

75
00:05:14.494 --> 00:05:19.834
So this is a little more powerful
of an approach and it lets

76
00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:26.974
me stay in the flow of writing without
having to go find some copy to copy paste
