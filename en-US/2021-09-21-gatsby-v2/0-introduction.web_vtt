1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.680
I'm excited.

2
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.260
Today is gonna be a good day we are
talking about an introduction to Gatsby.

3
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.960
Gatsby is a cool framework.

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.550
We're gonna talk more about what that is.

5
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.977
But before we do that,

6
00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:14.500
let's dive right in with a little
bit of an intro about who I am.

7
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.780
My name is Jason Lengstorf.

8
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.410
I am the VP of
Developer Experience at Netlify.

9
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.920
I'm also the host of Learn with Jason.

10
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.880
Once upon a time I was a Gatsby team
member, I used to work at at Gatsby.

11
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.490
I'm also a boop enthusiastic,
if you've ever seen my show.

12
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.224
You seen any of the silly projects that
I make, you'll know that corgis and

13
00:00:32.224 --> 00:00:34.450
boops factor in pretty heavily to my work.

14
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.258
So before we get started let's do a little
bit of disambiguation of what Gatsby is

15
00:00:38.258 --> 00:00:40.550
and isn't, so there are two Gatsby's.

16
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.380
If you start googling around,
you're gonna see references to Gatsby,

17
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.030
the framework, and you're also going
to see references to Gatsby cloud.

18
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.188
These are two sides of the same company,
one is an open source project,

19
00:00:53.188 --> 00:00:56.530
one is a business but
this can get a little bit confusing.

20
00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.571
So for the purposes of this workshop,
let's be clear that what we

21
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:05.130
are going be talking about is only
Gatsby the open source framework.

22
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.640
We are not going to talk
about Gatsby cloud today.

23
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.453
So if you're interested in Gatsby cloud,
you can check out gatsbyjs.com but

24
00:01:11.453 --> 00:01:12.910
we're not gonna cover that.

25
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.570
So at its core,
Gatsby is a site generator.

26
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.170
Gatsby is a way for
people to build sites from code.

27
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.700
It's very powerful for that.

28
00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.580
It kind of rose to popularity
as a way to manage your blog.

29
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.362
You could have markdown files and
turn those into a working blog site using

30
00:01:32.362 --> 00:01:36.205
react, which is a great way if you're
a developer to get your portfolio out

31
00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:40.353
into the world or start writing a blog
about what you're learning or otherwise,

32
00:01:40.353 --> 00:01:44.250
collect your thoughts and
get those shared with the world.

33
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.380
Gatsby is also built on react, so
react is a JavaScript framework.

34
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.730
It's made popular by Facebook,
it's what powers their UI.

35
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.190
And the main offering of react
is components and reactivity.

36
00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.560
So what you see with react is that you get
your UI breaks down into component files.

37
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.048
And those component files can be mixed,
matched, shared,

38
00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:12.480
remixed and
it's a little more containable.

39
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.075
It's a little easier to think about and
reason about what's happening in your

40
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:21.181
code, which is why react is powerful and
then the ability to add in that

41
00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:25.359
reactivity layer, that ability to
quickly pull in abrupt to changes,

42
00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.465
update the state based on what's going on,
keep track of some data and

43
00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:32.890
update a different part of
your UI based on that data.

44
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.494
Those are all things that make react
really appealing it's one of the reasons

45
00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:38.010
it's it's the leading
framework out there today.

46
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.560
Gatsby decided to built on react as
the right way to build for the web.

47
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.350
And it did this in a way that
involves server side rendering.

48
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.178
So server side rendering, is when you take
react code, which typically would run on

49
00:02:51.178 --> 00:02:54.920
a client, and you use a server,
to generate the resulting HTML.

50
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.149
So what would happen
after the react code ran,

51
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.840
gives you some markup that
would show in the browser.

52
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.690
That's how you can see the output
of a react app in the browser.

53
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.063
When you server side render react, you're
actually able to eliminate JavaScript

54
00:03:07.063 --> 00:03:09.160
altogether and you just get some HTML.

55
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.655
So Gatsby will take your react code,
server side rendering, put some HTML in.

56
00:03:14.655 --> 00:03:18.021
And then when it hits the browser,
it'll rehydrate and

57
00:03:18.021 --> 00:03:20.035
put that JavaScript back on top.

58
00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:23.726
So you start where if somebody disables
JavaScript with a Gatsby site,

59
00:03:23.726 --> 00:03:26.380
they'll still be able to load it,
it still works.

60
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.357
You can see the pages,
you can browse the site,

61
00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:30.990
everything works the way you would expect.

62
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.870
And then if you enable JavaScript, you
get more interactivity and more features.

63
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.501
The site will load and then become app
like, instead of having to do a full page

64
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:44.279
refresh, you'll get JavaScript redirects
between pages and there's a lot of

65
00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:49.440
extra bonuses that happen when you add
JavaScript but, it's not required.

66
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.810
It's an optional enhancement, which I
think is a really powerful model when you

67
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.350
start thinking about building
with JavaScript in general.

68
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.420
Gatsby is also all in on GraphQL.

69
00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.270
If you're familiar with GraphQL
it is another Facebook invention.

70
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.300
It Is a query language for data.

71
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.484
And if you've worked with API's before,

72
00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:12.620
one of the most common ways that you'll
see that done is through REST endpoints.

73
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.130
That's when you go to a website and
it goes slash API slash posts.

74
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.717
And then when you hit that, you end up
getting back a JSON object that's an array

75
00:04:21.717 --> 00:04:24.810
of the posts and
all the data that you have would need.

76
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.280
This is a really powerful model
when you're looking at REST API's.

77
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.860
They are great for
small subsets of data or linear data.

78
00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.762
But, as data grows in complexity,
you start to see this kind of network

79
00:04:38.762 --> 00:04:42.270
effect where well you
don't just need posts.

80
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:47.168
I need posts and the comments for
that post and the author of the post, and

81
00:04:47.168 --> 00:04:53.100
the authors of the comments and
comments written by those comment author.

82
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.466
And it just starts to get into this like
messy thing where I'm not just looking at

83
00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:57.570
data in one way.

84
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.764
I'm starting to think about
the the graph of data,

85
00:04:59.764 --> 00:05:02.090
the connections between all the data.

86
00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.830
That's what GraphQL is designed to solve.

87
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.821
GraphQL is a way to combine
data in a graph like

88
00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:10.905
way which means that we
can say I want my posts.

89
00:05:10.905 --> 00:05:14.851
Now write in the query for my posts,
I would like to get the author and

90
00:05:14.851 --> 00:05:15.970
the comments.

91
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.981
And then inside those queries, I would
also like to get additional comments,

92
00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:24.176
additional posts by that author, maybe
categories and related posts, all those

93
00:05:24.176 --> 00:05:27.941
things can happen in the same query,
whereas in REST, I would have to make

94
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:32.720
an individual REST call for each of those
things and then combine that data myself.

95
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:38.634
So, GraphQL is it treats data as
more of a free form, flexible thing,

96
00:05:38.634 --> 00:05:45.310
whereas REST is a little more rigid
about the way that it approaches data.

97
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.622
That's why Gatsby went all in on it.

98
00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:49.770
Gatsby has made this bet on.

99
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.135
You're going to build sites using content
from a lot of different places your

100
00:05:53.135 --> 00:05:56.707
file system, you'll have images, you'll
maybe pull in some third party data,

101
00:05:56.707 --> 00:05:59.270
you're gonna have additional
things coming in.

102
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.280
And all of those need to connect.

103
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.630
I have a blog post, but
I need to pull some images for it,

104
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.800
I also wanna pull in some comments
from a third-party system.

105
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.548
And there are a lot of things that lead to
me, needing data from a lot of sources and

106
00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:14.890
I don't wanna have to do that
data reconciliation myself.

107
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.594
GraphQL allows me to pull all those
together in a single query and

108
00:06:18.594 --> 00:06:19.491
then use them.

109
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:22.890
And that's why Gatsby is bet on that.

110
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.250
Gatsby is also opinionated, Gatsby is
going to tell you where to put your files.

111
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.840
It's gonna tell you how to query for data.

112
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:31.720
It's gonna give you components that you
should use to get all the benefits, right?

113
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.037
It's very much a framework that says,

114
00:06:34.037 --> 00:06:39.040
we're going to give you a set of
guardrails, within which you can succeed.

115
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.810
It's designed for that.

116
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:45.757
And this is a really good thing when you
are trying to get something done quickly,

117
00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:50.048
when you're trying to get a whole
team to follow the same set of rules,

118
00:06:50.048 --> 00:06:55.069
one of the biggest challenges you'll run
into with any sort of software at scale,

119
00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.480
is documentation.

120
00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.827
So when you write bespoke software,
you're not just writing code,

121
00:06:59.827 --> 00:07:03.290
you also have to write and maintain
the documentation for that code, or

122
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.597
else anybody who's never
worked on it before,

123
00:07:05.597 --> 00:07:10.240
is having to learn the entire system from
scratch through reverse engineering.

124
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.529
When you use an opinionated framework,
when you opt into something like reactor

125
00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:18.378
to Gatsby, what you're getting is
a lot of community documentation and

126
00:07:18.378 --> 00:07:22.870
a lot of community best practices
that lighten your documentation.

127
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.040
So instead of having to
document the whole system,

128
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.970
here's every bit of code we wrote, why it
does, what it does and how you can use it.

129
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.210
We can now say most of this is react,
most of this is Gatsby.

130
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:36.075
You are also able though,
to do these things,

131
00:07:36.075 --> 00:07:41.250
so we only have to to document our
custom stuff instead of the whole thing.

132
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.170
And that can be a strength.

133
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.643
It can also be a hindrance, and

134
00:07:44.643 --> 00:07:48.176
there are reasons why you wouldn't
want a super opinionated framework.

135
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.101
I find that for myself,
whenever I'm working on code,

136
00:07:51.101 --> 00:07:55.084
if I find that the majority of the code
I'm writing is to back out of decisions

137
00:07:55.084 --> 00:07:59.860
made by the framework I've chosen,
I've probably chosen the wrong framework.

138
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.180
So when you're planning your project when
you're thinking through how you're going

139
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:07.030
to build this thing,
start considering the trade offs.

140
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:11.210
Is this something that will benefit
from that consistency those guardrails.

141
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.500
That high predictability of how things
will be created on the site, or

142
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.140
is this something where what
I'm trying to do is weird.

143
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.900
I'm trying to do something
that I've never seen before.

144
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:23.956
And for me to do this using a framework
will require me to back out a bunch of

145
00:08:23.956 --> 00:08:28.278
decisions or use the escape hatches to
get away from the opinions that are held

146
00:08:28.278 --> 00:08:29.430
by this framework.

147
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:35.200
Gatsby is built around performance,
it's one of their core value propositions.

148
00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.980
They are very conscious of how to
make websites load and feel faster.

149
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:45.240
One of the big promises of the web has
always been that we can make our own app

150
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:45.740
store.

151
00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.740
We've seen this in progressive web apps.

152
00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.208
We've seen this in the ability
to have a website be offline and

153
00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:54.170
installable on your
desktop on mobile phones.

154
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:59.520
But there's always been this kind of issue
where apps generally just feel better.

155
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.370
They feel snappy.

156
00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:02.511
They feel like things just happen, right?

157
00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:05.200
And Gatsby is trying to
address that problem.

158
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.256
Gatsby is doing a lot of things behind
the scenes that make pages feel

159
00:09:09.256 --> 00:09:14.080
like they load instantly, that make
your initial page loads really fast.

160
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.266
And all of that we'll get into
the specifics of how they do that,

161
00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:19.600
as we start actually building a site.

162
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.436
But at its core, Gatsby is always trying
to think about the way that it will

163
00:09:24.436 --> 00:09:27.260
impact its users on the performance side.

164
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.007
And probably the biggest reason to
use Gatsby is that Gatsby is wildly

165
00:09:32.007 --> 00:09:33.080
convenient.

166
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.290
It has a bunch of starters that do
most of the things you would need.

167
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.130
You wanna build a blog?

168
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.573
Great, there's a bunch of different
templates that you can install right now

169
00:09:41.573 --> 00:09:42.840
that will give you a blog.

170
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.580
And all you have to do is start writing.

171
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:48.040
It also has a huge number of plugins.

172
00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.032
And whether those are for pulling in data
from somewhere else hooking into third

173
00:09:52.032 --> 00:09:56.180
party services, doing transformations
of data into different formats.

174
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:01.140
All of those things are not only possible,
but really straightforward with Gatsby.

175
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.428
So if you're trying to get something up
in a hurry, Gatsby is worth considering

176
00:10:05.428 --> 00:10:09.780
because it's so so fast and so convenient
versus rolling something on your own.
