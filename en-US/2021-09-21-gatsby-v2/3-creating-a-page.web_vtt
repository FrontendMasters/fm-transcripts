WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.349
We now have our Gatsby project,
and there's nothing in it,

2
00:00:04.349 --> 00:00:08.375
it won't do anything right
now because there's no code.

3
00:00:08.375 --> 00:00:10.715
So, let's create our first page,

4
00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:15.011
we're gonna make the simplest
possible Gatsby site that we can.

5
00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:17.979
And the way that we do
that is in our source,

6
00:00:17.979 --> 00:00:21.285
we're gonna create a new
folder called pages.

7
00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:25.737
And then inside this pages,
we're gonna create a new file, and

8
00:00:25.737 --> 00:00:28.057
we're gonna call it index.js.

9
00:00:28.057 --> 00:00:33.101
So the concept of pages in Gatsby,
this is a magic folder, and

10
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:39.018
what that means is as Gatsby is run,
it's gonna look for source pages and

11
00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:43.870
anything inside of it,
it will treat as a page for the site.

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.839
So by creating index.js,

13
00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.156
what I've just done is created the index
page, the home page for my site.

14
00:00:51.156 --> 00:00:56.255
So let's import everything as React,
this is something that you have to

15
00:00:56.255 --> 00:01:01.439
do in Gatsby right now, because they
haven't turned off the requirement

16
00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:05.632
to import React when you're
not using imports from React.

17
00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:09.328
That will likely change in the future,
but for now it's a little

18
00:01:09.328 --> 00:01:13.860
quirk of Gatsby that we still have to
import everything from React not Gatsby.

19
00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:20.268
And then,
we can export a default function,

20
00:01:22.368 --> 00:01:27.396
And there's no this decision here
to use a default function versus

21
00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:32.514
export default with a fat arrow
function or an anonymous function or

22
00:01:32.514 --> 00:01:36.767
any of those things,
those are all arbitrary choices.

23
00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.131
This is my preference,

24
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:42.033
I like having named functions makes
my components easier to debug.

25
00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:46.060
The only big thing is it has to be
a default export pages in Gatsby,

26
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.811
have to be a default export or
else they won't get picked up.

27
00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:54.417
And inside of this,
we can just return some basic code,

28
00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:58.054
so I'm gonna do main tag, what's up Mark?

29
00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:03.016
&gt;&gt; Does Gatsby recognize startup.ts or
TSX files or

30
00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:06.094
does that require some setup?

31
00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:10.719
&gt;&gt; That's a great question
I believe Gatsby,

32
00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:16.975
let's see that might be
an intermediate Gatsby question.

33
00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:21.818
But, they have a doc on this
that we can share I think,

34
00:02:21.818 --> 00:02:28.506
I think it just works yeah natively
supports JavaScript and TypeScript.

35
00:02:28.506 --> 00:02:35.173
So if you just add the dot tsx
extension you will get TypeScript.

36
00:02:35.173 --> 00:02:37.299
We're not gonna write TypeScript today,

37
00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.970
mainly because I don't know
TypeScript well enough to teach it.

38
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.533
So we are going to stick with
regular old JavaScript but,

39
00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:49.360
there are some really good TypeScript
resources on Frontend Masters on learn

40
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.984
with JSON anywhere that you want to go,
if you wanna dig into TypeScript.

41
00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:55.459
Okay, so in our index page,

42
00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.787
what we're going to do is we're
exporting a default function.

43
00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:02.261
I named it index page, so
that it'll show up in debug logs, and

44
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.740
we're returning a just a main element,
and you can make this whatever you want.

45
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.011
It could be a div or whatever,
and I'm going to put an h1 and

46
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.184
let's do hello front end masters.

47
00:03:15.184 --> 00:03:18.097
Okay, that's it,
you've now built a Gatsby site,

48
00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.505
that is the simplest possible Gatsby site.

49
00:03:20.505 --> 00:03:23.671
It's one file, one React component and

50
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:27.590
now we can make this thing work,
so let's run it.

51
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.374
I'm gonna NPM run develop,
Wait, I need to actually

52
00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:35.206
install all the dependencies forgot
to actually run NPM install.

53
00:03:35.206 --> 00:03:40.610
So inside the repo that we cloned,
I'm running NPM install or I for short.

54
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.574
And this is going to pull in
Gatsby React and React DOM,

55
00:03:43.574 --> 00:03:45.584
which are the dependencies we need.

56
00:03:45.584 --> 00:03:48.867
Gatsby is a little bit big
because it does a lot,

57
00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:51.503
so it can take a little bit to install.

58
00:03:51.503 --> 00:03:54.896
That doesn't mean that it ships all of
that most of what it pulls in is only for

59
00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:56.930
development, not for production.

60
00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.647
So it's a big package, but it still ships
relatively light amount of JavaScript.

61
00:04:01.647 --> 00:04:05.408
Okay, so we have completed
the install we are ready to roll, and

62
00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:10.146
it looks like I stopped the scrolling cuz
I had actually only took 16 seconds and

63
00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:12.878
I was just staring at my
scrolled up terminal.

64
00:04:12.878 --> 00:04:17.163
So now that we've actually got the
dependencies, we've got our dependencies,

65
00:04:17.163 --> 00:04:18.680
we've got our page.

66
00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.457
And again,
all the pages is a React component and

67
00:04:21.457 --> 00:04:26.405
it's in this special pages folder inside
of our source directory, and index.js, so

68
00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:29.270
this is gonna create our
homepage of the site.

69
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.129
Let's run develop, and what we can see
happens here is the Gatsby develop CLI

70
00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.366
command runs, and
Gatsby starts doing its thing.

71
00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:41.746
So a lot happens in here, and
you can see that it's looking for config,

72
00:04:41.746 --> 00:04:43.359
it's setting up a cache.

73
00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:46.987
It's looking for whether or
not there are Gatsby functions which we

74
00:04:46.987 --> 00:04:51.518
aren't gonna talk about today but we will
cover in the intermediate Gatsby course.

75
00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:55.594
It has a handful of lifecycle functions
and things like that, the vast majority of

76
00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:59.552
this is what's happening under the hood,
not something that you as a developer

77
00:04:59.552 --> 00:05:03.760
need to care about, unless you're
trying to do something very specific.

78
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.599
So for the most part you just look for
all the successes to run and

79
00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:10.590
you'll see a list here of
all of our files names.

80
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.958
So let's open this up, and
now we have Hello Frontend Masters, so

81
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.678
this is our working site.

82
00:05:16.678 --> 00:05:22.372
And if we inspect this,
let me make this a little bit bigger so

83
00:05:22.372 --> 00:05:27.397
you can see it,
you can see that inside here the site,

84
00:05:27.397 --> 00:05:30.840
has generated a Gatsby div.

85
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.025
This is where Gatsby puts everything,
it adds this div and

86
00:05:34.025 --> 00:05:36.570
then it runs the site inside of here.

87
00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.033
And we can see that there's some
accessibility stuff this is actually

88
00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:42.799
really slick,
where it's making the page focusable.

89
00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:47.388
So if you do navigation on the client
side, a lot of times what happens is,

90
00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:52.273
screen readers and other accessibility
tools don't realize that the page has

91
00:05:52.273 --> 00:05:56.291
been changed, because no browser
page change event happened.

92
00:05:56.291 --> 00:06:00.286
So what Gatsby is doing is it's adding
some helpers that make that work,

93
00:06:00.286 --> 00:06:02.260
inside of that, we get our markup.

94
00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.800
And as you can see, this is just straight
up markup, that's all there is to it.

95
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.468
And to see what this looks
like when we build it,

96
00:06:10.468 --> 00:06:15.624
let's actually build this site so
I'm gonna run NPM run, build.

97
00:06:15.624 --> 00:06:21.430
And the reason I wanna show this is
that Gatsby when it's in development

98
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.188
mode adds things for
hot reloading and debugging output.

99
00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:29.558
And some other information that makes
the bundle a little bit bigger,

100
00:06:29.558 --> 00:06:33.399
when you build the site, it takes all of
that out it builds a production bundle.

101
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.468
So let's run this thing,
we're gonna run serve,

102
00:06:39.468 --> 00:06:42.497
and this opens up in 9000.

103
00:06:42.497 --> 00:06:46.052
And so if we look at this,
not a lot has changed here but

104
00:06:46.052 --> 00:06:53.862
let's check out the Network tab,
If I can find my Network tab, here it is.

105
00:06:53.862 --> 00:06:57.140
Let's maybe make this a lot bigger so
we can see what's going on.

106
00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:04.881
So I'm going to refresh the page
now that we're running, and

107
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:09.290
we can see that we sent down
about 184 kilobytes of resources,

108
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:13.316
a lot of it is, let's disable
the cache and run that again.

109
00:07:15.961 --> 00:07:20.888
So 63.6 kilobytes transferred,
that's after compression and everything,

110
00:07:20.888 --> 00:07:23.430
and we got the whole
page down pretty fast.

111
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.999
Obviously, we're on localhost so
everything's gonna be real fast.

112
00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:30.792
But we can see here that it's sending
down a little bit of Webpack runtime it

113
00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:34.292
sends down about 42 kilobytes
of the framework, and

114
00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:38.070
then our app comes out
to about 15.6 kilobytes.

115
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.988
And then we can see some other stuff
in here that's kinda cool like,

116
00:07:41.988 --> 00:07:45.210
we get the index page is
sent down as a component.

117
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:50.198
And then we get JSON,
that is the data for the page,

118
00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:54.240
and JSON that's for the app itself.

119
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.514
And this data will get more interesting
as we add more things to our site.

120
00:07:57.514 --> 00:08:00.332
And again, none of this is stuff
that you need to care about,

121
00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:03.003
this is just how Gatsby is
running things under the hood.

122
00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:06.487
But what this means is if I go in and
I disable JavaScript,

123
00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.384
let me see if I can find it here.

124
00:08:11.389 --> 00:08:16.089
Where are my advanced settings,
let's close the console, and

125
00:08:16.089 --> 00:08:19.667
I'm going to here this is
what I was looking for.

126
00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:24.877
Then I can disable JavaScript
down here somewhere, there we go,

127
00:08:24.877 --> 00:08:29.343
so I'm gonna disable JavaScript and
refresh the page.

128
00:08:29.343 --> 00:08:32.950
And now look, we still get our
Hello Frontend Masters, and

129
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.890
if we look at the markup,
we still have our markup here.

130
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:39.560
All the things that we wanted,
are presence, so

131
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.130
the site's still works without JavaScript.

132
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:48.844
But what doesn't happen, is you can see
that all of this JavaScript got blocked,

133
00:08:48.844 --> 00:08:52.951
so we sent a lot less data,
but we didn't need it.

134
00:08:52.951 --> 00:08:58.248
It's all optional enhancements, these
are things that build on top of the site,

135
00:08:58.248 --> 00:09:03.031
so that's one of the things that's
really powerful about about Gatsby.

136
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:06.112
&gt;&gt; The tab index is negative one for
for the parent div,

137
00:09:06.112 --> 00:09:11.960
which makes stuff not focusable, or I'm
confused what exactly that's there for.

138
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.755
&gt;&gt; Right now it's not there for anything,
when we add a second page which

139
00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.729
is what we'll do next,
I'll show you how that works.

140
00:09:18.729 --> 00:09:24.621
And that is how we signify to
the document that a page has changed.

141
00:09:24.621 --> 00:09:28.130
So, let's actually go ahead and do that,

142
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:34.976
we're gonna create a second page here,
and this one we can call about.

143
00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:38.619
And so
what what's worth mentioning here is that,

144
00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:44.290
what we're doing is we're basically
creating HTML files with the same name.

145
00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:50.279
So index.js becomes index.html,
which browser shortcut to slash.

146
00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:55.301
About will become about.html or
slash about, and for us to do that, we can

147
00:09:55.301 --> 00:10:01.680
actually take all the same information out
of here, so I'll just copy paste this one.

148
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.218
And let's call this one AboutPage(), and

149
00:10:05.218 --> 00:10:09.046
update some copy here
we'll do About this site.

150
00:10:12.334 --> 00:10:15.270
Okay, so having done that now note,

151
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.924
my site is still wait I need
to go back to npm run develop.

152
00:10:21.627 --> 00:10:24.241
If npm run develop had been running this,

153
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.019
it would have picked this up without
having to restart, because new pages,

154
00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:32.096
Gatsby can recover from that and
just show them.

155
00:10:32.096 --> 00:10:36.640
So let's close the server
go back over here,

156
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.878
and we've got about now works.

157
00:10:39.878 --> 00:10:44.283
Okay, so this is great so
again I'm navigating directly,

158
00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:48.247
which means that we are getting
that full page event,

159
00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:52.492
which doesn't require any
activity on Gatsby's side.

160
00:10:52.492 --> 00:10:57.764
But the next thing that we wanna do is
we wanna figure out how to do a link.

161
00:10:57.764 --> 00:11:03.383
So before we do that,
let me go ahead and just commit my work.

162
00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:14.498
So I'm gonna get into GitHub, And
then we're gonna go into this project.

163
00:11:14.498 --> 00:11:18.899
So frontend-masters-intro-gatsby-project,
and

164
00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:24.588
let's just check our stuff, so
we've created two pages so far, right?

165
00:11:24.588 --> 00:11:27.682
So I'm going to commit this and
just say create pages, so

166
00:11:27.682 --> 00:11:31.678
I'm gonna open up a new one,
we're gonna call this branch progress, and

167
00:11:31.678 --> 00:11:34.850
this is the one that I'll
actually be changing things on.

168
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:40.535
So if I look at our log, we can see
here's our commit, we created pages and

169
00:11:40.535 --> 00:11:45.441
I'm going to push, To progress.

170
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:49.581
So I'll continually push to the progress
branch throughout the workshop, so

171
00:11:49.581 --> 00:11:51.660
you can see the code going up as we do it.
