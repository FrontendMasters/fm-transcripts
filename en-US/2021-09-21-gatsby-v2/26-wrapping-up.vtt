00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.350
So, what to do next.

2
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.277
If you're excited, you're really looking
forward to getting started with Gatsby you

3
00:00:07.277 --> 00:00:08.820
wanna go build something.

4
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.000
There are a few things that you can do.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.750
First and foremost,
we've got another course coming up.

6
00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.080
We're gonna do an intermediate
Gatsby course on Friday.

7
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.907
That's two days from now,

8
00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:24.800
that will also be turned into a front
end masters workshop or course.

9
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.430
So if you wanna go deeper, come back,
take the intermediate Gatsby course.

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.370
You can check out the docs, Gatsby JS
has a ton of docs at gatsbyjs.com/docs.

11
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.860
There is a full on tutorial,
like a zeroed up and running.

12
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.438
There are lots of conceptual
guides on routing, on images,

13
00:00:45.438 --> 00:00:51.120
on data sourcing, on plugins,
all the things that we talked about today.

14
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.070
You can go much deeper in the docs.

15
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.590
And then they have API references for
all of that.

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.190
Now, the docs have started
to sprawl a little bit.

17
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.620
So it can be a little tricky.

18
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.030
And you may have noticed me kind of
googling around trying to find the thing

19
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.470
that I was looking for.

20
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.020
So don't get discouraged if you
have a little bit of trouble.

21
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.460
There's a lot of information
about Gatsby in there.

22
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.940
Keep googling, you'll find it I promise.

23
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.900
You can also just get out there and
publish something.

24
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.637
The best way to learn something
is to get reps, use the tool,

25
00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:23.440
put it on the internet,
get that thing live.

26
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.650
Just have a silly idea and put it up on
the internet so that people can play.

27
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.290
Good example of this like I wanted to
make fun of my coworker Phil Hawksworth.

28
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.377
And so I bought a domain and
edited his head onto an animated GIF,

29
00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:44.260
and then I just put this together.

30
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.075
I just wanted to make it
a goofy thing to share.

31
00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:52.685
I built this in probably 10 minutes,
and I put it on the internet.

32
00:01:52.685 --> 00:01:57.520
Because there's nothing more fun
than hitting that publish button and

33
00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.430
being able to share
a bad idea that you had.

34
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.864
I also like built a little goofy thing,
I think this is a Gatsby

35
00:02:05.864 --> 00:02:11.577
site that just lets you put anything,
it breaks all the links.

36
00:02:11.577 --> 00:02:14.597
So whenever you try to
click a link on a page,

37
00:02:14.597 --> 00:02:18.310
uses the goose sound from
the untitled goose game.

38
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.670
This is another bad idea
project I built it in an hour.

39
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.610
And I just put it on the internet
because it made me smile.

40
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.198
So if you are trying to
decide what you should build,

41
00:02:29.198 --> 00:02:33.160
don't let a lack of a good idea stop you.

42
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.000
This was a terrible idea.

43
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.650
This was a terrible idea, but
it was still fun to publish.

44
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.420
It was fun to put it out there.

45
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.785
And playing as a means of learning, is
one of the best ways to make it stick and

46
00:02:44.785 --> 00:02:47.460
it's one of the best
ways to lower the stakes.

47
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.950
You wanna get out there and
just try things.

48
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.500
See what you can build,
see what you can get done.

49
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.370
Put a time box on it.

50
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.020
How much can I get done in an hour?

51
00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.730
What can I publish in an hour?

52
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.407
And then actually put it on the Internet,
share it with friends,

53
00:03:00.407 --> 00:03:02.900
show people your bad ideas,
because then you get feedback.

54
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.452
People will tell you what they liked,
what they want to see instead,

55
00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:07.950
they'll give you an idea for
your next bad website.

56
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.980
And then you can just keep playing.

57
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.684
And the more you play,
the more you learn, the more you can do.

58
00:03:12.684 --> 00:03:15.747
And the more likely you are to be able to
accomplish whatever gets thrown at you in

59
00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:16.990
your normal work.

60
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.410
So, I hope that you all go out there and
get excited.

61
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.640
Start playing with Gatsby and and
put some stuff out on the internet.

62
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.258
Please send me something on
Twitter if you have questions, but

63
00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:30.380
I'd also love to see what you build.

64
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.643
So if you're out there, if you're
building stuff, tag me when you share it,

65
00:03:33.643 --> 00:03:34.291
I wanna see it.

66
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:37.540
I wanna take a look.

67
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.680
That's it for me all.

68
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.580
I had a blast today,
I hope you had a lot of fun.

69
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.786
I hope you learned a lot,
I hope you're excited to go out there and

70
00:03:43.786 --> 00:03:44.440
build something.
