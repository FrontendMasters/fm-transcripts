00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.500
Let's talk a little bit about
what we're going to do today.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.440
Will kinda run through the the table
of contents for this course.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.950
So the first thing we're gonna
cover is the initial site setup.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.256
We're gonna go from mostly empty folder,
I'm not gonna walk you through,

5
00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:15.560
like setting up a gitignore.

6
00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.300
So, we'll clone all of that.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.643
But we'll set up what's
the bare minimum Gatsby site.

8
00:00:20.643 --> 00:00:25.535
We're going to get through pages and
linking, how do pages work in Gatsby,

9
00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:27.453
how do you link between them?

10
00:00:27.453 --> 00:00:29.651
We're gonna look at how
GraphQL works in Gatsby.

11
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:34.036
It is a little bit different than you may
have expected in if you've used GraphQL

12
00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.153
and other systems.

13
00:00:35.153 --> 00:00:37.670
GraphQL, and
Gatsby is sort of its own thing.

14
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.514
So, we'll look at how that works,
and what's different about it.

15
00:00:40.514 --> 00:00:42.380
We're also gonna look at SEO and metadata.

16
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.550
How do you add Title Tags?

17
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.660
How do you add those Meta Tags?

18
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.715
Those things that give you social
sharing images, all that stuff,

19
00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:48.900
we're gonna dig into it.

20
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.640
We will look at shared layouts.

21
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.946
How do you add some Markup like
a header that persists between pages,

22
00:00:55.946 --> 00:00:58.701
common styles, all those things?

23
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:00.800
We're gonna look at global styling.

24
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.640
So how to add CSS that affects everything,
as well as scoped styling.

25
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.543
How do you write some CSS that only
affects the given component that you're

26
00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:08.060
working on?

27
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.190
We're gonna look at writing with MDX.

28
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.922
So, if you wanna use MDX,
we'll talk about what that is.

29
00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:16.011
And you want to use that for
writing your blog.

30
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:18.380
We're gonna show you how to configure it,
how to get it up and running,

31
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.860
how to write some pages.

32
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.320
We're gonna look at image optimization.

33
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.590
This is one of the core
features of Gatsby,

34
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.090
one of the things that Gatsby
is probably most known for.

35
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.890
We're gonna look at how to do it.

36
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.914
We're also going to look
at third-party data.

37
00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:34.135
How can we pull in data
from a headless CMS Mess.

38
00:01:34.135 --> 00:01:35.310
We'll use a headless CMS Mess today.

39
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.920
But you'll use the same flow for
pulling in from an API, or

40
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.340
from your own data sources, custom files,
like a YAML file, or a JSON file.

41
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.980
We'll show you how to do that.

42
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.010
We'll look at generating pages from
that custom data, whatever we pull in.

43
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.810
We'll have Gatsby build some pages for us.

44
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.540
And then we're gonna look at deployment.

45
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.260
How do we take this site that we've
built and get it up on the Internet, and

46
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.700
we'll do that all today.

47
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.350
It's gonna be great.

48
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.860
So next,
let's talk about the resources for today.

49
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.270
We're gonna be working off of two repos.

50
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.120
What we'll be working on, is we're gonna
have a walk through in code snippets.

51
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.894
And that is gonna live at
frontendmasters.learnwithjason.dev/intro--

52
00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:16.730
to-gatsby.

53
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.570
This is a site that I lifted
wholesale off of Brian Holt.

54
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.470
He has a really great way
of presenting courses.

55
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.061
If you've never watched one of
his courses on Frontend Masters,

56
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.247
I highly recommend you do it.

57
00:02:26.247 --> 00:02:30.963
But it's a lesson it's gonna kinda step
through each thing we're gonna cover today

58
00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:32.167
with code snippets.

59
00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.945
The diffs of what the code
looked like before and

60
00:02:34.945 --> 00:02:37.382
what it'll look like once you're done.

61
00:02:37.382 --> 00:02:41.947
So as you're following along, if you feel
like you're lost, you can always jump to

62
00:02:41.947 --> 00:02:45.440
the right page that we're on in
this workshop and get caught up.

63
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.380
I also have the source code up on GitHub.

64
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.103
There is a repo at jlengstorf,
that's my GitHub username,

65
00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.680
/frontend-masters-intro-to-gatsby-project.

66
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.950
That is where we're
actually gonna be working.

67
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.924
So, the main branch is the one that will
clone that's the starter for the project.

68
00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:06.857
And then there is a progress branch,
I think I called it test progress.

69
00:03:06.857 --> 00:03:11.080
Cuz I'm gonna actually commit to a real
progress branches as we go today.

70
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.055
But if you wanna see the code at any
given point, you can jump into that.

71
00:03:15.055 --> 00:03:19.048
And the commit messages will match up
roughly with the steps in the site.

72
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:22.280
So that you can jump to where we are and
see where things are.
