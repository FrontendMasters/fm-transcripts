00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.500
Let's talk a little bit about
what we're going to do today.

2
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.440
We'll kinda run through the table
of contents for this course.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.950
So the first thing we're gonna
cover is the initial site setup.

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.580
We're gonna go from a mostly empty folder.

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.875
I'm not gonna walk you through
like setting up a git ignore, so

6
00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:17.300
we'll clone all of that.

7
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.340
But we'll set up what's
the bare minimum Gatsby site?

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.460
We're going to get through pages and
linking.

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.090
How do pages work in Gatsby?

10
00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.430
How do you link between them?

11
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.780
We're gonna look at how
GraphQL works in Gatsby.

12
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.420
It is a little bit different
than you may have expected.

13
00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.801
And if you've used GraphQL in
other systems, GraphQL and

14
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.670
Gatsby is sort of its own thing.

15
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.500
So we'll look at how that works and
what's different about it.

16
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.380
We're also gonna look at SEO and metadata.

17
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.550
How do you add title tags?

18
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.660
How do you add those meta tags?

19
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.340
Those things that give you social
sharing images, all that stuff.

20
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.900
We're gonna dig into it.

21
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.640
We will look at shared layouts.

22
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.637
How do you add some markup like
a header that persists between pages,

23
00:00:55.637 --> 00:00:58.810
common styles, all those things.

24
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.380
We're gonna look at global styling.

25
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.640
So, how to add CSS that affects
everything, as well as scoped styling.

26
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.543
How do you write some CSS that only
affects the given component that you're

27
00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:08.060
working on.

28
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.190
We're gonna be look at writing with MDX.

29
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.800
So if you wanna use MDX,
we'll talk about what that is.

30
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.120
And you want to use that for
writing your blog.

31
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.406
We're gonna show you how to configure it,
how to get it up and running,

32
00:01:18.406 --> 00:01:19.860
how to write some pages.

33
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.320
We're gonna look at image optimization.

34
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.488
This is one of the core
features of Gatsby,

35
00:01:23.488 --> 00:01:27.090
one of the things that that Gatsby
is probably most known for.

36
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.890
We're gonna look at how to do it.

37
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.940
We're also going to look
at third party data.

38
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.064
How can we pull in data
from a headless CMS.

39
00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:35.310
We'll use a headless CMS today.

40
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.048
But you'll use the same flow for
pulling in from an API, or

41
00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:44.340
from your own data sources, custom
files like a YAML file or a JSON file.

42
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.980
We'll show you how to do that.

43
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.957
We'll look at generating pages from
that custom data, whatever we pull in,

44
00:01:49.957 --> 00:01:52.810
we'll have Gatsby build some pages for us.

45
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.540
And then we're gonna look at deployment.

46
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.260
How do we take this site that we've
built and get it up on the internet, and

47
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.700
we'll do that all today.

48
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.350
It's gonna be great.

49
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.860
So, next,
let's talk about the resources for today.

50
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.270
We're gonna be working off of two repos.

51
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.120
What we'll be working on is we're gonna
have a walkthrough in code snippets.

52
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.894
And that is gonna live at
frontendmasters.learnwithjason.dev/intro--

53
00:02:15.894 --> 00:02:16.730
to-gatsby.

54
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.570
This is a site that I lifted
wholesale off of Brian Holt.

55
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.470
He has a really great way
of presenting courses.

56
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.890
If you've never watched one of
his courses on Frontend Masters,

57
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.320
I highly recommend you do it.

58
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.960
But this is a lesson it's gonna kind
of step through each thing we're gonna

59
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.854
cover today.

60
00:02:31.854 --> 00:02:34.446
With code snippets, the diffs of
what the code looked like before and

61
00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:36.380
what it'll look like once you're done.

62
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.369
So as you're following along, if you feel
like you're lost, you can always jump

63
00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.440
to the right page that we're on in
this workshop and get caught up.

64
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.380
I also have the source code up on GitHub.

65
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.256
There is a repo at jlengstorf,

66
00:02:49.256 --> 00:02:54.680
that's my GitHub username slash
frontend-masters-intro-to-gatsby-project.

67
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.950
That is where we're
actually gonna be working.

68
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.050
So the main branch is the one that we'll
clone that's the starter for the project.

69
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.700
And then there is a progress branch.

70
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.623
I think I called it test progress cuz I'm
gonna actually commit to a real progress

71
00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.080
branch as we go today.

72
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.937
But if you wanna see the code at any
given point, you can jump into that.

73
00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:19.802
And the commit messages will match up
roughly with the the steps in the site.

74
00:03:19.802 --> 00:03:22.280
So that you can jump to where we are and
see where things are.
