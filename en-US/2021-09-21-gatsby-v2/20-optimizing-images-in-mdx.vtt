00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.074
If we want to use the static images,
like what if we want to do this in MDX?

2
00:00:06.074 --> 00:00:11.300
Well, fortunately,
MDX is kind of central that Gatsby

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.650
just kind of built this into the flow,
they'll automatically do this for us.

4
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.100
We don't have to do anything at all.

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.780
So we could use a static image, right?

6
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.660
And that would be fine.

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.900
That's a completely
acceptable thing to do.

8
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.995
And if we wanted to do that,

9
00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:34.480
we would be able to let's say open up
our first blog, and we can import.

10
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.290
Boy, it can't spell import
static image from Gatsby

11
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.803
plugin image and
then down here I can just use it.

12
00:00:53.458 --> 00:00:56.290
Right, there it is, we've now made a blog.

13
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.540
But I don't even wanna have to do that,
I wanna make it so much easier.

14
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.620
So instead, I wanna be able to
import my images, like markdown.

15
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:14.487
So I wanna be able to say my image and
images.

16
00:01:14.487 --> 00:01:20.252
It's like images smashburger.

17
00:01:24.637 --> 00:01:26.446
I got my path wrong.

18
00:01:26.446 --> 00:01:32.250
And I got my path wrong because
we haven't configured this yet.

19
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.090
So this is where it starts like, markdown
I would expect to just work but it's

20
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.003
not actually relative because of the way
that like these end up moving and these

21
00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:47.280
end up becoming static and so there's
a little bit of like rigmarole there.

22
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.989
So to work around that,
what we are going to do is we are going to

23
00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.550
install a plugin called
Gatsby-remark-images.

24
00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.341
So, remark is a library for
transforming markdown,

25
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:06.770
without getting to deep into it,
it can break remark into a,

26
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.497
what's called an abstract syntax tree,

27
00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:17.060
which is just like a JSON representation
of what a mark down file is.

28
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.074
And then because it's a predictable
representation of that that tree,

29
00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:24.580
we can change stuff in it without
breaking the markdown files.

30
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.185
So what the remark images plugin lets
us do is find images in markdown,

31
00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:35.930
turn them into transformed Gatsby
images and replace them in place.

32
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.190
So on the backend, it does a bunch, on our
end we install this plugin and we're done.

33
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.200
So let's get into the Gatsby config and
we're going to install this in two places.

34
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.780
First we are going to install it,
let's put it, where's MDX?

35
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.579
We're gonna to put it right above MDX,

36
00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:01.855
Gatsby-remark-images and then inside.

37
00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:07.083
We're also going to configure
Gatsby remark plugins

38
00:03:07.083 --> 00:03:12.795
because we want MDX to run
this internally as well.

39
00:03:12.795 --> 00:03:20.097
So we're going to- let's see
Gatsby-remark-plugins is an array and

40
00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:25.485
we're going to resolve
Gatsby-remark-images and

41
00:03:25.485 --> 00:03:30.152
I want to set as a just
kind of basic guardrail,

42
00:03:30.152 --> 00:03:35.539
a maximum width of 1200
pixels if something comes

43
00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:40.353
in through markdown that
is an enormous image.

44
00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:45.109
Like somebody does just
copy a unsplash image and

45
00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.390
it's 4500 pixels wide.

46
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.656
We don't want to load that, let's just
knock it down to be 1200 pixels max so

47
00:03:52.656 --> 00:03:55.320
that the site doesn't blow up on us.

48
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.600
So now we've got Gatsby-remark-images.

49
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.700
We've got an installed there.

50
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:06.090
So let's restart

51
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.406
the browser.

52
00:04:16.805 --> 00:04:21.270
And I'm going to put in a different
image into my first blog.

53
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.720
Let's do one.

54
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.340
Another corgi so
this is a corgi lying down your phone.

55
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.890
And there's cherry tree.

56
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.470
It's a great image and
we are just going to do a relative image.

57
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.612
Now, we're going to go back,
get into the images folder and

58
00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:38.329
then we're going to find
this image by Shiangling.

59
00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:48.450
And as you can see this defaults
to the blurred images type.

60
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:53.756
So if I go to network and
slow that down a bit, so

61
00:04:53.756 --> 00:04:58.600
we can see it happen,
it shows up as a blurred image.

62
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.110
And then it'll pop in as unblurred, yeah.

63
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.378
But that all worked, and if we look
at their source, we can see it did,

64
00:05:11.378 --> 00:05:13.898
Gatsby responsive image dropper, and

65
00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:17.509
it's got the pieces that we
want here with a source set.

66
00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.721
This isn't quite as full featured
as the one with the picture and

67
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:23.700
the modern fallbacks.

68
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:28.200
But you know what, for
two lines worth of code, it's not bad.

69
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.380
So that's pretty great.

70
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.042
And if we did want to control it with
like the different blurred backgrounds

71
00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:41.890
are we want to add different styles or
things, we can do that,

72
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.780
we would just do that through using a
static image instead of a markdown image.

73
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.754
The markdown images are gonna be full
within your content area by default, so

74
00:05:51.754 --> 00:05:53.830
they'll always kinda do this.
