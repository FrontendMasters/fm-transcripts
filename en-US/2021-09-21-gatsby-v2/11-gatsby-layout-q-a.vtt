00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.070
&gt;&gt; One, I noticed in your VS code,
do you have an extension for

2
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.340
your GraphQL to display
the syntax highlighting.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.816
&gt;&gt; Yes, I have what's it called?

4
00:00:15.423 --> 00:00:20.700
I have the GraphQL extension
from the GraphQL foundation.

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.323
&gt;&gt; Is there any documentation
within Gatsby for

6
00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:28.300
transferring an existing website that
has nothing to do with Gatsby to Gatsby.

7
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.180
&gt;&gt; Like an existing react site or
like any site.

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.060
&gt;&gt; Just any site like any documentation on
starting to integrate Gatsby into that?

9
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.920
&gt;&gt; That's a good question.

10
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.440
I think they might have a migrating to
Gatsby, let's see they've got some.

11
00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:52.984
That's a blog post from somebody else on

12
00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:57.820
migrating, here's one on WordPress.

13
00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.080
I don't know that they have
any Doc's on this actually,

14
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.759
it looks like there are a lot of community
resources on this that you can use,

15
00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.620
that will like allow you to pull
the the RSS feed from a site.

16
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.894
&gt;&gt; Or other ways of importing data that
you can then use to populate the site,

17
00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:22.913
It depends on, how the site is
structured what your data sources are,

18
00:01:22.913 --> 00:01:25.660
and what you're trying to preserve.

19
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.630
If you wanna bring over
the whole look just straight up.

20
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.336
Then you can do that you would kind
of copy paste the site into a layout

21
00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:40.350
component and then punch holes in it where
the, the custom content would need to be.

22
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.986
But again,
that kind of there are a lot of,

23
00:01:43.986 --> 00:01:49.240
what does your current setup look like,
questions before you

24
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.921
can give a solid answer to how to
migrate wasn't thinking, Mark.

25
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
how would you go about adding a CSS reset?

26
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.155
&gt;&gt; If you wanted to add a CSS reset, I
would add it right in the global here, so,

27
00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:11.730
for me like to be completely honest, this
is now my CSS reset, is to do like this.

28
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.263
&gt;&gt; Sometimes what I'll do is,
I'll set margin 0, and

29
00:02:16.263 --> 00:02:22.008
then I'll do what's called the l
Lobotomized Owl Selector, where

30
00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:29.340
you set any element that is adjacent to
another element gets a one rep top margin.

31
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.622
But as you can see this this can
introduce some weirdness, so

32
00:02:31.622 --> 00:02:33.150
I don't do that anymore.

33
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.359
But yeah, if you wanted to do a reset,
you would just drop it right in here,

34
00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.604
If you wanted, you could create
a reset CSS and just import it.

35
00:02:44.604 --> 00:02:50.214
In the same way, and these will I
believe they get imported in order,

36
00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:52.630
so if you wanted to do a reset,

37
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.560
you would just like probably put it
right up here, something like that.

38
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.979
&gt;&gt; Does Gatsby have a history
call like in react router,

39
00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:07.308
were able to show you know,
if I hit the back button.

40
00:03:07.308 --> 00:03:10.900
&gt;&gt; There is an API in Gatsby.

41
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.430
API doc, that's what we're looking for.

42
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.623
So if you are using the navigate helper
function, which is what we're looking for,

43
00:03:19.623 --> 00:03:25.830
there is a import navigate from Gatsby,
and so you can do navigation.

44
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.014
You can add state to it and

45
00:03:28.014 --> 00:03:33.636
stuff ,so that you can push history on and
then if you wanted to.

46
00:03:33.636 --> 00:03:42.130
Like changing your back button behavior,
your link like replace.

47
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.430
Where is the,
I think if you wanted to do like actual,

48
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.470
implement your own back button that's not

49
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.770
in Gatsby ,but you can update
the history the way that

50
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:06.140
you would under the hood
Gatsby uses reach router.

51
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.316
So if you look at the reach router, Docs
you can actually reach into that package

52
00:04:11.316 --> 00:04:16.587
and do a bunch of custom stuff there, but
that's a little out of scope for today.

53
00:04:16.587 --> 00:04:22.050
We can add, if you have specific questions
about that, you can hit me up on Twitter.

54
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.920
This is, I'm always happy to have
some questions, just send me a tweet.

55
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.036
&gt;&gt; Why wouldn't we set variables
in the global dot CSS, and

56
00:04:32.036 --> 00:04:37.988
then use them in a header dot module
dot CSS for accessing those variables.

57
00:04:37.988 --> 00:04:39.020
&gt;&gt; why would we?

58
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.420
&gt;&gt; Or why wouldn't we?

59
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:42.600
I guess.

60
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.497
&gt;&gt; So yeah, I like that pattern,
that's what we're doing in the global

61
00:04:47.497 --> 00:04:53.070
CSS ,here we set these variables and
then we access those in the layout.

62
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.396
I like this pattern, and it is a pattern
that I am happy to use in my projects,

63
00:04:58.396 --> 00:05:02.579
If you look at my open source
you'll see that I do this a lot.

64
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.269
There are always trade offs when you
get to the way you manage styles, and

65
00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:13.040
one of the trade offs of this one is
that this looks a little bit like magic.

66
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:17.211
So a way, that you can you can control
this is you could potentially put together

67
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:19.040
a variables dot CSS.

68
00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.007
And that is a signal to
the rest of the team that these

69
00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:27.640
configuration values are in there,
they can go find them.

70
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:33.289
But ultimately, there's not like a
downside outside of the standard downsides

71
00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.170
of organizing code in any way where, there
are upsides and downsides of all this.

72
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.106
I really like this, versus some kind
of JavaScript based configuration,

73
00:05:43.106 --> 00:05:45.478
because somebody who
knows CSS can come in and

74
00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:49.120
work on this project without
having to learn JavaScript.

75
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.800
And to me, that's a benefit.

76
00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.848
&gt;&gt; And so
the question there is essentially using

77
00:05:56.848 --> 00:06:01.378
the CSS variables instead of CSS module,

78
00:06:01.378 --> 00:06:05.230
setting it to variable, I see.

79
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.218
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz the other way, that we would
have to do this is we would need to

80
00:06:10.218 --> 00:06:13.310
duplicate these values all over the place.

81
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.250
Or we would need to install something
like sass so that we could get variables.

82
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.163
Or we'd have to introduce CSS and
JS stuff so

83
00:06:22.163 --> 00:06:25.920
that we could put these
variables somewhere.

84
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.690
For me,
this is the path of least resistance.

85
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:34.374
And the nice thing about this too is,
if you wanna re declare a color or

86
00:06:34.374 --> 00:06:39.470
a better example of this would be
if you were to set like a font,

87
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:45.675
let's say that we set the text size base,
and we call that 18 pixels.

88
00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:48.855
And then down here,
we know that's what we wanna use.

89
00:06:48.855 --> 00:06:53.914
So we say tech size base, but then later
on, we wanna have an aside component and

90
00:06:53.914 --> 00:06:57.490
that aside component we
know should be smaller.

91
00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.219
I can override this, I can say
text-size-base and set it to 16 pixels.

92
00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:08.738
And, then anything inside of
this aside will automatically

93
00:07:08.738 --> 00:07:15.119
get a lower text size base, if we
base the values off of this variable,

94
00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:21.765
it gives you a lot of control without
having to add tooling to manage it.

95
00:07:21.765 --> 00:07:23.745
It's just kind of built
into the CSS language.
