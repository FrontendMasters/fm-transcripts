1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.651
Now that we've got this ability,
the images are here and

2
00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:08.380
they're actually being pulled in and
everything is what we want.

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.110
I wanna start showing these on the site.

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.970
So Gatsby has multiple ways
that we can make this happen.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.732
The first one that I wanna do
is I just wanna show this Corgi

6
00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:23.010
image which is here,
we've got this Corgi image.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.916
Now I wanna show this on the homepage
in a little circle, right?

8
00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:29.871
So, to make that happen,
we're gonna have to write some CSS and

9
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:32.330
that's okay because we
know how to write CSS.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.200
So I want to get into my index.js and
I'm going to.

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.356
Well actually, you know what,

12
00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:44.230
let's just write the styles first
because we know we're gonna do.

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.486
So I'm gonna go in and
create a new sculpt thing.

14
00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:50.660
I'm gonna call this index.module.css.

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.990
So we're gonna use a CSS module for this.

16
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.330
And I want to have support for
an image wrapper class.

17
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.770
And inside of this I'm
gonna use display flex,

18
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.170
I will use align items center and
justify content center.

19
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.409
Cuz I just want this thing to be,
whatever area it uses,

20
00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.490
I want the image to be
in the center of it.

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.200
Then inside of my image wrapper I wanna
target the the Gatsby image wrapper.

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.526
So Gatsby by default is gonna add
markup to show the placeholders and

23
00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:33.890
things like that.

24
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.697
We'll look at this in a second, but

25
00:01:35.697 --> 00:01:38.418
I just happened to know that
it adds a data attribute.

26
00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.121
And the reason I'm using
the data attribute is that I

27
00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:49.070
don't want this to be
mashed up by CSS modules.

28
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.034
I wanna target the the actual
element in here,

29
00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:55.780
not a class name that
will get messed up on me.

30
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.597
So, then we're going to
set a border of 3px solid,

31
00:02:01.597 --> 00:02:05.961
and I'm gonna use the black color, and

32
00:02:05.961 --> 00:02:11.120
then I wanna set the border
radius to 50% and

33
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.130
I think that should do it.

34
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.470
So, let's save that.

35
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.260
Then I'm gonna import this in here.

36
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.610
We're gonna get the image wrapper.

37
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.902
Now, a note here.

38
00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:29.742
Do you see how I'm camel
casing image wrapper here,

39
00:02:29.742 --> 00:02:32.830
but I wrote it as kebab case here.

40
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.040
That's convenience, because I really
don't like writing camel case in CSS.

41
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.520
It feels weird to me.

42
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.919
I equally don't wanna have
to do array selection

43
00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:51.250
to get a named kebab
case class out of here.

44
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.130
So it just handles that, it'll convert
kebab case into camel case for me so

45
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.536
that I don't have to worry about it.

46
00:02:58.536 --> 00:03:02.249
Then once I've got my my style
I'm gonna be able to do and

47
00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.830
I'm unable to pull in an image.

48
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.199
So what I wanna do is I'm actually just
gonna use the simplest possible form of

49
00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:12.320
this which is what's called static image.

50
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.900
And static image is what I would urge
you to try to use most of the time.

51
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.350
As long as you know the name of the file,
you are probably going to be happier if

52
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.380
you use static image
because it's just simpler.

53
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.094
It works just like a regular old image and
to show how that actually works,

54
00:03:30.094 --> 00:03:32.390
let's get into our layout.

55
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.647
And I'm gonna just add a div, we'll
give it a class name of imageWrapper.

56
00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.848
And inside of it,
I'm gonna use a static Image.

57
00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:49.670
And this, right off the gate,
is exactly like an image tag.

58
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.680
So I wanna go up a level to images and
then I wanna get this Ivana La photo.

59
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.207
And for my alt, it's a corgi sitting on

60
00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:07.560
a bed with red paper
hearts all over it and

61
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.672
it looks on unamused, right?

62
00:04:11.672 --> 00:04:17.020
So, that's a descriptive alt text for
anybody who's using an assistive device.

63
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.890
But then what I can do is I can actually
go a little bit further with this.

64
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.494
So I wanna tell Gatsby that for
the placeholder,

65
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:25.060
I'm gonna use the dominant color.

66
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.451
So whatever the dominant color in
this image is I want that to be what

67
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:30.030
the placeholder is.

68
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.400
I'm also gonna set the width.

69
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.604
I want the width of it
to be 300 pixels and

70
00:04:34.604 --> 00:04:37.360
I also want the height to be 300 pixels.

71
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.894
So rather than me having to go and restyle
this stuff on my own, I can tell Gatsby

72
00:04:41.894 --> 00:04:46.580
like hey, take this image and
just make it a 300 pixels square.

73
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:47.700
And look at that.

74
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.480
It automatically did all
of that resizing for us.

75
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.998
And if I reload the page here.

76
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.790
You can see how that kind
of loads in pretty quick.

77
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.290
So let me actually build this because,
well, let's do two things.

78
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.808
First, let's look at what
Gatsby just built for us.

79
00:05:04.808 --> 00:05:11.830
So here is the image
wrapper div that I added.

80
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.602
Everything inside of this is,
is a Gatsby image.

81
00:05:15.602 --> 00:05:20.150
So let me edit as HTML and
now that's too hard to read.

82
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.610
So let's break it out like this.

83
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.040
So, we have a Gatsby image wrapper.

84
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.130
That's where this data Gatsby
image wrapper comes from.

85
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.950
That's what I targeted so
that we can style it with the border.

86
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:39.440
And then we have our placeholder
which is just empty.

87
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.590
It's a transparent box
to kinda hold the space.

88
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.910
Then we've got a, sorry,
this is the placeholder.

89
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.937
And the placeholder is
empty according to this,

90
00:05:53.937 --> 00:05:56.640
then we use a picture tag.

91
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.170
So the picture starts with image web P.

92
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.610
So if the browser hits image web P and
it understands what that is,

93
00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.320
it will use this source.

94
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.334
If it does not understand image web p,

95
00:06:11.334 --> 00:06:16.690
it will then fall back to the original
image, which is the JPEG.

96
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.422
So it is effectively saying use,
show this placeholder and

97
00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:28.060
then that transitions out to zero and
you can kind of see this happen here.

98
00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.350
Where it fades out.

99
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.170
And then the image fades in.

100
00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:39.685
That's Gatsby saying wait until the full
image is loaded and then faded in on top.

101
00:06:39.685 --> 00:06:43.165
Then we have this picture
that will optimize for

102
00:06:43.165 --> 00:06:47.689
the the smallest file size and
fall back to a bigger file size if

103
00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:52.380
the browser doesn't support it,
and then we have a no script.

104
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.648
So if the image or
if JavaScript is disabled,

105
00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:58.320
we will still get our images loaded.

106
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.727
So it's not like we're saying by
using this this Gatsby approach,

107
00:07:01.727 --> 00:07:04.730
we lose the ability to display
images without JavaScript.

108
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.170
So there's a fallback that will just show
these images and still it's responsive.

109
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.260
So we'll still get.

110
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.530
We just won't get placeholders.

111
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:13.800
That's the the main difference.

112
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.885
And finally,

113
00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:21.392
the script here that causes Is the element
once it loads to like swap out.

114
00:07:21.392 --> 00:07:23.141
So Gatsby does a lot under the hood.

115
00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:28.751
There's a lot going on, that we don't
have to care about or think about.

116
00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:30.678
That just makes our lives easier, right?

117
00:07:30.678 --> 00:07:31.931
That's that's pretty nice.
