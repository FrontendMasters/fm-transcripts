WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.344
Now that we've got this ability
the images are here and

2
00:00:03.344 --> 00:00:07.650
they're actually being like pulled in and
and everything is what we want.

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.262
I wanna start showing these on the site,
so

4
00:00:10.262 --> 00:00:13.970
Gatsby has multiple ways that
we can make this happen.

5
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.732
The first one that I wanna do
is I just wanna show this Corgi

6
00:00:18.732 --> 00:00:23.010
image which is here,
we've got this Corgi image.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.316
Now I wanna show this on the homepage
in a little circle, right,

8
00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:29.622
so to make that happen,
we're gonna have to write some CSS, and

9
00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:32.330
that's okay because we
know how to write CSS.

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.050
So I want to get into my index .js.

11
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.186
And I'm going to, well actually,

12
00:00:39.186 --> 00:00:44.047
what let's just write the styles
first because we know we're gonna do.

13
00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:45.613
So I'm gonna go in and

14
00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:50.660
create a new sculpt thing I'm
gonna call this index.module.CSS.

15
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.572
So we're gonna use a CSS module for
this, and I want to have support for

16
00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:57.330
an image wrapper class.

17
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.550
And inside of this I'm gonna
use display flex will use

18
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.170
align items center and
justify content center.

19
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.409
Cuz I just want this thing to be,
whatever area it uses,

20
00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.490
I want the image to be
in the center of it.

21
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.200
Then inside of my image wrapper,
I wanna target the Gatsby image wrapper.

22
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.526
So Gatsby by default is gonna add
markup to show the placeholders and

23
00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:33.890
things like that.

24
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.544
We'll look at this in a second, but

25
00:01:35.544 --> 00:01:38.039
I just happened to know that
it adds a data attribute.

26
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:45.014
And the reason I'm using
the data attribute is that I

27
00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:49.070
don't want this to be
a mashed up by CSS modules.

28
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.917
I wanna target the actual element in here,

29
00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:55.780
not a class name that
will get messed up on me.

30
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.752
So then, we're going to set
a border of three picks solid,

31
00:02:00.752 --> 00:02:04.340
and I'm gonna use the black color.

32
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.730
And then I wanna set
the border radius to 50%.

33
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.322
And I think that should do it, so

34
00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:19.260
let's save that then I'm
gonna import this in here.

35
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.510
We're gonna get the image wrapper now,
a note here.

36
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.525
Do you see how I'm camel
casing image wrapper here?

37
00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:35.384
But I wrote it as kebab case here,
that's convenience,

38
00:02:35.384 --> 00:02:42.520
because I really don't like writing
Camel case in CSS It feels weird to me.

39
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.409
I equally don't wanna have to
do like a race election to

40
00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.059
get a named kebab case class out of here,
so it just handles that,

41
00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:56.920
convert kebab case into camel case for me,
so that I don't have to worry about it.

42
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.108
Then once I've got my style,
I'm gonna be able to do and

43
00:03:02.108 --> 00:03:04.830
I'm unable to pull in an image.

44
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.120
So what I wanna do is I'm actually just
gonna use the simplest possible form of

45
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.320
this, which is what's called static image.

46
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.900
And static image is what I would urge
you to try to use most of the time.

47
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.501
As long as you know the name of the file,
you are probably gonna be happier if you

48
00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:25.380
use static image because
it's just simpler.

49
00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.262
It works just like a regular old image and
to show how that actually works,

50
00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:34.780
let's get into our layout,
and I'm gonna just add a div.

51
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.310
We'll give it a class name, image wrapper.

52
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.474
And inside of it,
I'm gonna use a static image, and

53
00:03:44.474 --> 00:03:49.670
this right off the gate is
exactly like an image tag.

54
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.680
So I wanna go up a level to images and
then I wanna get this Ivana La photo.

55
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.170
And for my alt,
it's a Corgi sitting on a bed with red

56
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.060
paper hearts all over it,
and it looks on unused.

57
00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.008
Right, so

58
00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:15.890
that's a descriptive alt text for
anybody who's using an assistive device.

59
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.890
But then what I can do is I can actually
go a little bit further with this.

60
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.494
So I wanna tell Gatsby that for
the placeholder,

61
00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:25.060
I'm gonna use the dominant color.

62
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.451
So whatever the dominant color in
this image is I want that to be what

63
00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:30.030
the placeholder is.

64
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.316
I'm also gonna set the width, I want
the width of it to be 300 pixels and

65
00:04:34.316 --> 00:04:37.360
I also want the height to be 300 pixels.

66
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.980
So rather than me having to go and restyle
this stuff on my own, I can tell Gatsby

67
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.055
like, hey, take this image and
just make it a 300 pixels square.

68
00:04:46.055 --> 00:04:50.927
And look at that, it automatically
did all of that resizing for us and

69
00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:52.780
if I reload the page here.

70
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.190
You can see how that kind
of loads in pretty quick,

71
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.290
so let me actually build this because,
well, let's do two things.

72
00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.225
First, let's look at what
Gatsby just built for us, so

73
00:05:07.225 --> 00:05:11.830
here is the image wrapper
div that I added.

74
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.400
Everything inside of this,
is a Gatsby image, so let me edit as HTML.

75
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.610
And now that's too hard to read, so
let's let's break it out like this.

76
00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.774
So we have a Gatsby image wrapper, that's
where this data Gatsby image wrapper comes

77
00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:30.950
from, that's what I targeted, so
that we can style it with the border.

78
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:38.148
And then we have our placeholder,
which is just empty,

79
00:05:38.148 --> 00:05:44.590
it's a transparent box to
kind of hold the space.

80
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.677
Then we've got a, sorry,
this is the placeholder, and

81
00:05:50.677 --> 00:05:56.640
the placeholder is empty according
to this, then we use a picture tag.

82
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.863
So the picture starts with image WebP,
so if the browser hits image WebP and

83
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:08.050
it understands what that is,
it will use this source.

84
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.969
If it does not understand image WebP,

85
00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:16.690
it will then fall back to the original
image, which is the JPEG.

86
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:22.165
So it is effectively saying us,
like show this placeholder and

87
00:06:22.165 --> 00:06:25.368
then that transitions out to zero and

88
00:06:25.368 --> 00:06:30.350
you can kind of see this happen here,
where it fades out.

89
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.411
And then the image fades in, that's Gatsby
saying like wait until the full image is

90
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:37.944
loaded and then faded in on top.

91
00:06:37.944 --> 00:06:44.160
Then we have this picture that will
optimize for the smallest file size and

92
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.787
fall back to a bigger file size if
the browser doesn't support it.

93
00:06:49.787 --> 00:06:53.214
And then we have no script,
so if the image or

94
00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:58.320
if JavaScript is disabled,
we will still get our images loaded.

95
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.790
So it's not like we're saying
by using this Gatsby approach,

96
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:05.070
we lose the ability to display
images without JavaScript.

97
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:10.042
So there's a fallback that will just show
these images and still it's responsive, so

98
00:07:10.042 --> 00:07:13.800
we just won't get placeholders,
that's the main difference.

99
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.381
And finally, the script here that causes
Is the element once it loads to swap out.

100
00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:23.560
So Gatsby does a lot under the hood,

101
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.918
there's a lot going on that we don't
have to care about or think about,

102
00:07:27.918 --> 00:07:31.931
that just makes our lives easier,
right, that's pretty nice.
