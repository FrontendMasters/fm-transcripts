1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.047
So in here, we're going to,
let me make this smaller again.

2
00:00:04.047 --> 00:00:09.263
I'm gonna import everything as
React from React, as you do.

3
00:00:09.263 --> 00:00:13.600
I'm going to import GraphQL from Gatsby.

4
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.987
I'm gonna import Gatsby image,

5
00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:21.029
because we want to use Gatsby images for
showing those episode cards.

6
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.418
And then I want to import
our layout from components.

7
00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:31.713
Wait, I'm two folders in, aren't I?

8
00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:36.071
Components, layout, all right.

9
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:40.009
So then I'm gonna export
a const called query,

10
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:44.646
because we wanna do a GraphQL
query to get episode data.

11
00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:47.322
So when we generate this filename,

12
00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:52.880
what that's gonna cause Gatsby to
do is a very, very simple query.

13
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.220
The query that it's gonna do
is not gonna be filtered.

14
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.550
It's not gonna get the title or
the guest name.

15
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.582
It is only gonna get the ID and

16
00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:09.310
whatever the field is that it needs to
create the thing, so slug, current.

17
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.343
So this is all that's gonna be queried
by Gatsby during page creation.

18
00:01:15.343 --> 00:01:20.030
But that ID is all we need
to make a page query.

19
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.373
So in here I'm going to create a new
query, we'll call this SanityEpisode,

20
00:01:26.373 --> 00:01:31.410
and we're going to pass in the ID and
that's a string.

21
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.103
So, remember when I said that
whenever Gatsby creates a page,

22
00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:37.970
it puts things in page context?

23
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.650
That GraphQL query is getting
handed to this page in context.

24
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.920
So we have both the ID and the slug
as a variable in our GraphQL query.

25
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.680
I wanna get it this ID.

26
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.763
So I'm gonna use that, so
then I can pick instead of all

27
00:01:54.763 --> 00:01:57.710
SanityEpisode I'm gonna
get one SanityEpisode.

28
00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.968
So, singular SanityEpisode, and

29
00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:06.840
I'm going to check that the ID
equals the ID that was given to us.

30
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.330
Then inside, we want the title,
I want the description.

31
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.526
I want the current slug,

32
00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:19.727
because we're gonna link to it
on the Learn with Jason site.

33
00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:24.369
Then we wanna get the YouTube ID,
I also wanna get the date and

34
00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:27.090
we'll do that from now.

35
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.790
Filter again because I
want it to be relative.

36
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.009
I'm gonna get the image, and
here's a cool thing that Sanity does.

37
00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:39.970
Sanity is designed to support
Gatsby image data by default.

38
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.220
So we don't actually need to do anything.

39
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.344
We can just use Sanity and
it will automatically configure any images

40
00:02:49.344 --> 00:02:55.546
from Sanity itself to provide Gatsby image
data as part of the transformer plugin.

41
00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:59.414
So there are a lot of
tools that will do that,

42
00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:04.530
Sanity is one of them,
Contentful is another one.

43
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.660
And there's a list of a few more that
you can find on the Gatsby image docks.

44
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.499
As well as a guide on how to do that
in your own transformer plugins,

45
00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:16.703
if you wanna add a source for your own.

46
00:03:16.703 --> 00:03:19.505
If you're working on a headless CMS or
an API, and

47
00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:23.709
you want Gatsby to be able to pull it
in with automatic image optimization,

48
00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.070
there's a tutorial you can follow
on how to do that as well.

49
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.270
Cool, so we've got this query now,
we can use it.

50
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:37.330
Let's export default function,
SanityEpisode.

51
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.380
That's gonna be the name of our component.

52
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.001
And we're gonna get data,
that data is the result of this query.

53
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.697
So if I wanted to,
I could just return pre JSON

54
00:03:50.697 --> 00:03:54.875
stringify(data, null 2) right?

55
00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:57.110
And then I need to close my parentheses.

56
00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:05.300
Let's put this in the layout just so
it looks somewhat usable.

57
00:04:08.305 --> 00:04:12.230
All right, so Gatsby images yeah,
defined but never used that's okay.

58
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.829
Let's get a list, let's see what happened.

59
00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:15.425
So here's my 404.

60
00:04:15.425 --> 00:04:19.830
We didn't actually build the pages,
so we're going to stop and restart.

61
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.102
Cuz we created that new dynamic page so

62
00:04:22.102 --> 00:04:25.580
we actually need Gatsby to
run again to detect that.

63
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.280
And you can see here now
sanity is giving info as well.

64
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.064
So we can see that it's pulling in
information and dropping it in.

65
00:04:34.064 --> 00:04:39.907
And so when I refresh this page, now we
have 242 pages instead of the original,

66
00:04:39.907 --> 00:04:43.600
because it created all of
these different pages.

67
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.890
So let's click into one of these.

68
00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.240
And look at that,
there is all of our data.

69
00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.152
So this, we've dynamically
created all of these pages, and

70
00:04:53.152 --> 00:04:59.007
because we wrote I this query, we now
have access to all the Sanity data for

71
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:02.550
that episode in the component itself.

72
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:08.850
So what I'm able to do then is I can take,
let's simplify this a bit.

73
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:15.390
We'll get the episode, And
that'll be data.sanityEpisode,

74
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.580
not capitalized though there, all right?

75
00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.451
And then inside here,
you can set a title of episode.title.

76
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:31.713
You can set a description of episode,
description.

77
00:05:31.713 --> 00:05:35.960
We could set the image,
I'm not gonna worry about it.

78
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.190
So, instead let's set up Gatsby image.

79
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.941
And what I wanna do here is
we're gonna set the image is

80
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:51.130
going to be episode.image.asset,
GatsbyImageData.

81
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.968
And the alt is going to
be the episode title.

82
00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:03.567
Then we can do an h1
with the episode title.

83
00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:11.667
All right, let's do a paragraph tag and
we'll say when it was posted.

84
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:15.003
So sorry, posted not episode.

85
00:06:15.003 --> 00:06:20.010
Posted on episode,

86
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:27.670
date and then let's see here.

87
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.954
Drop in the description,
so episode.description.

88
00:06:32.473 --> 00:06:32.973
Okay?

89
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.890
Then what we can do is let's just
add some details about this, right?

90
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:44.818
So we've got in here, if you wanna
watch this on the original show,

91
00:06:44.818 --> 00:06:47.210
we can link out to the site.

92
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:53.223
So learnwithjason.dev, and
then drop in the episode slug current.

93
00:06:55.466 --> 00:06:56.594
Right?

94
00:06:56.594 --> 00:07:02.330
And then we'd say full episode and
details.

95
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.065
And then underneath that,
we can add another one.

96
00:07:06.065 --> 00:07:08.501
What if we just wanna
watch this on YouTube?

97
00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:14.633
We can say https, go to youtu.b,

98
00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:18.869
which is the shortcut.

99
00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:23.575
And then we can do episode.youtubeID and

100
00:07:23.575 --> 00:07:28.280
that'll take you right to the the episode

101
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.458
on YouTube and say watch on YouTube.

102
00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:36.271
All right, so
that's like an episode component right, so

103
00:07:36.271 --> 00:07:37.959
let's see what happens.

104
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.390
Bang, look at that.

105
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.240
With very little custom code we
just wrote some markup, right?

106
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.410
We didn't have to dig into internals.

107
00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.200
We didn't have to figure
out where data lives.

108
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:53.070
We didn't have to really do a lot.

109
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.061
We were able to just use this
GraphQL Explorer to figure out

110
00:07:56.061 --> 00:07:57.940
what data looked like.

111
00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.500
And then build a page out.

112
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.135
So again, this is a really
really slick way to get a lot

113
00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:07.700
of data in very short order.

114
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.519
I find this to be a really compelling
reason to lean on Gatsby when I'm

115
00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:14.523
trying to build something.

116
00:08:14.523 --> 00:08:18.114
If I need to get something up quickly,
Gatsby's a good way to do that.

117
00:08:18.114 --> 00:08:23.054
You are able to very quickly plug in
whatever data source, write some react,

118
00:08:23.054 --> 00:08:25.720
you know what the data is gonna look like.

119
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:30.421
You don't have to figure out, well, what's
the difference between the way that air

120
00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:33.898
tables API works, and
the way that Contentfull's API works?

121
00:08:33.898 --> 00:08:34.833
I don't have to care,

122
00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:37.600
because when they come into Gatsby,
they look exactly the same.

123
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.540
They're nodes,
I'm gonna query those nodes.

124
00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:43.530
I'm gonna filter them based on predictable
filters that Gatsby provides, and

125
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.148
I'm gonna show those as pages.

126
00:08:45.148 --> 00:08:48.763
Same workflow whether it's MDX or
images or Sanity data or

127
00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:50.840
something entirely different.

128
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.860
That predictability is a big boost for
using Gatsby.

129
00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.213
It's a big reason to steer
into Gatsby as a tool.
