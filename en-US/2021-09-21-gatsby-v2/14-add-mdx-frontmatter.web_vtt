00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:05.957
So Frontmatter is a pretty common
way to send in config with markdown.

2
00:00:05.957 --> 00:00:10.722
And the way that that works is,
let's see, we can just add.

3
00:00:10.722 --> 00:00:13.130
I'll always refer to this
as a fenced code block.

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.438
I don't know if it has an official term,
but

5
00:00:16.438 --> 00:00:18.960
that's what I usually
hear it referenced as.

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.441
So let's put this one in as,
let's say year is 2021.

7
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:27.462
Today is August 11th, so
let's put it in as August 11th.

8
00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:32.382
We'll set a title of My First Blog, and

9
00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:39.698
we will set a description of
This is my first MDX blog post.

10
00:00:39.698 --> 00:00:45.730
Okay, so that is the basics of
how we would use Frontmatter.

11
00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.721
So we can go into the other blog and

12
00:00:50.721 --> 00:00:53.404
let's add more.

13
00:00:53.404 --> 00:00:54.630
This one's from the future.

14
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.090
It'll happen tomorrow.

15
00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.614
And we can say, Another Blog, and

16
00:01:00.614 --> 00:01:06.079
let's do like Watch out, I'm on a roll.

17
00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:11.130
Okay, so
now we've got this metadata in here.

18
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.388
And if we go into our GraphQL setup,

19
00:01:13.388 --> 00:01:16.339
we can see that some new
things have happened.

20
00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:19.200
Now we got all MDX here, right?

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.446
But we can also see if we go into our
page nodes that, where did it go?

22
00:01:29.698 --> 00:01:33.040
Children and then there's an MDX option.

23
00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.876
And in the MDX option, you can get
like the title and the rawBody.

24
00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:44.165
How weird it missed all of the pieces.

25
00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:47.708
Now, this is a little bit of
a roundabout way to do it anyways.

26
00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:51.006
The easier thing to do is to just go for
all MDX.

27
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:55.724
So let's get all the nodes, and we're
gonna get the title and the date, and

28
00:01:55.724 --> 00:01:57.735
I'm gonna make this relative.

29
00:01:57.735 --> 00:02:01.640
So let's say from now, and
then I wanna get the rawBody again.

30
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.910
So now we can kinda see here's
the rawBody of our post.

31
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.747
Here's what it is,
when it was posted and it looks like

32
00:02:11.747 --> 00:02:17.510
we're getting GMT, so
the hours are a little bit weird.

33
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.866
Or wait,
what are we getting in five hours?

34
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:21.838
What timezone is that?

35
00:02:21.838 --> 00:02:24.555
I think it's GMT.

36
00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:30.948
That gives us the date relatively,
or if we turn this off,

37
00:02:30.948 --> 00:02:36.306
we'll get the date as a timestamp,
yeah, GMT.

38
00:02:36.306 --> 00:02:39.618
And then you can also set other filters.

39
00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:45.619
We're not gonna stress about that, but
if you wanted to do like full name month,

40
00:02:48.644 --> 00:02:53.214
You can format it like that, and
then you'll get the August 12th, 2021.

41
00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.350
You can do the short version of the month.

42
00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.380
You can do the number abbreviation or the
number abbreviation without leading zeros.

43
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.016
However you wanna do that.

44
00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:12.050
So there's a lot of nice ways to make
these work if you wanna pull in the dates.

45
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.770
And then we can just kinda
grab out whatever we need.

46
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.190
So I wouldn't actually use the rawBody,
I would use the HTML.

47
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.811
So we get the HTML, this might not
work in the GraphQL explorer actually

48
00:03:26.811 --> 00:03:32.350
because HTML gets rendered at build time,
so this might blow up on us.

49
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.850
Yeah.

50
00:03:36.304 --> 00:03:40.738
Let's just stop and restart that.

51
00:03:40.738 --> 00:03:45.180
MDX has a few special things that
make it a little bit tricky.

52
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.530
So some of that stuff can get weird.

53
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.750
But we also get access to the headings,
which is pretty cool.

54
00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.018
So if you wanted to build
the table of contents,

55
00:03:56.018 --> 00:04:00.620
you can pull out the headings and
what level of depth they are.

56
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.873
So there's there's a lot of really
nice stuff that you can do here,

57
00:04:05.873 --> 00:04:11.785
where you're able to do some pretty
advanced things out of the the GraphQL.

58
00:04:11.785 --> 00:04:13.689
I think what else is in here?

59
00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.020
So that's the code body.

60
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.560
And then will the HTML always crash or
did something just go weird?

61
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.810
Yeah, the HTML will always crash.

62
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.770
So let's not use that.

63
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.480
So instead, what we can do is
let's use that SEO component.

64
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.845
And to actually make this work because,
if you'll notice, let me stop and

65
00:04:33.845 --> 00:04:37.450
restart this so
that we've got a working dev server.

66
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.549
We have one problem,
which is we got these pages working.

67
00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:47.956
Let me get back to one of
our pages that still exists.

68
00:04:47.956 --> 00:04:49.715
I deleted the series.

69
00:04:56.488 --> 00:04:58.940
Let's go to another blog, right?

70
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.220
So we've got another blog.

71
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.495
But if I look in the head,
it's using all my default values,

72
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:09.678
and that's not actually what I want.

73
00:05:09.678 --> 00:05:14.726
So it picked up some of this,
like it picked up the the blog post path,

74
00:05:14.726 --> 00:05:19.790
but it didn't pick up my description and
didn't pick up my my title.

75
00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.615
To do that, which I would hope
it just comes right out of here.

76
00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.105
Whatever I put in here, I want to work.

77
00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:33.295
The trick is that our layout
component needs props to be set.

78
00:05:33.295 --> 00:05:35.412
And in order to set those props,

79
00:05:35.412 --> 00:05:41.120
we can't just directly wrap the layout
because this won't apply any props to it.

80
00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.863
So instead, we need to do a little bit of,

81
00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:49.580
Working around to get this
to function the way we want.

82
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.680
So we're gonna create a custom
layout specifically for our posts.
