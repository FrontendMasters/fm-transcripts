1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.313
All right.
So we've got our, site's still running.

2
00:00:03.313 --> 00:00:04.107
We can move here.

3
00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:06.021
We can go to our about page.

4
00:00:06.021 --> 00:00:10.852
This isn't particularly useful right now
because we have to know the names of these

5
00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:12.449
pages to get between them.

6
00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.849
So why don't we set up some links.

7
00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.608
And now we could do,
there's nothing wrong with just

8
00:00:20.608 --> 00:00:25.384
doing a planet link,
I could do something like this.

9
00:00:25.384 --> 00:00:29.998
And I'd click it and I would go home,
but it does a full page refresh.

10
00:00:29.998 --> 00:00:33.713
We don't want that we want that
Gatsby kind of app like experience.

11
00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:38.491
So what I'm going to do to make that
work is I'm going to use Gatsby's link

12
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:42.518
component, so we can just import
that directly from Gatsby.

13
00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:46.567
And then down here instead
of using an a tag,

14
00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:52.487
I'm gonna use the link component and
we use two instead of href.

15
00:00:52.487 --> 00:00:56.493
In the link component so
we're going to link to home and

16
00:00:56.493 --> 00:01:00.252
let's maybe use different
call this back to home.

17
00:01:00.252 --> 00:01:03.738
All right, so
now we have this back to home.

18
00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:07.728
Now watch this tab index and watch
the fact that the page doesn't refresh.

19
00:01:10.489 --> 00:01:12.489
It did everything so
fast that we didn't even see it.

20
00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:17.580
Cool, here's the other part that it does
is it's got this Gatsby announcer and

21
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.101
so you see how it says
that we navigate it.

22
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.217
So let's go back.

23
00:01:22.217 --> 00:01:24.868
So, we're at about this site.

24
00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:29.364
So, then when we click,
here we go navigated to Hello masters or

25
00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:31.045
Hello friend masters.

26
00:01:31.045 --> 00:01:34.610
And that sort of like what Gatsby is
doing to make things more accessible.

27
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.579
It looks like it's happening so
fast that we can't see some of it, but

28
00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.290
that's the gist of what's going on.

29
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.458
And then we can do the same
thing on our homepage.

30
00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:47.503
So let's just copy paste this link.

31
00:01:47.503 --> 00:01:50.637
Right, and then we can drop this in here.

32
00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:54.700
We'll do a link to, and we're gonna go,

33
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.423
to about ,and say, about this site.

34
00:01:58.423 --> 00:02:01.693
Okay, so
now that we've created these two links,

35
00:02:01.693 --> 00:02:06.560
we can bounce back and forth, and
you can see that what's happening is it's

36
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.851
changing without having
to fully reload the page.

37
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:13.562
So this gives us that app like
experience that we're after,

38
00:02:13.562 --> 00:02:15.975
we are able to navigate between pages.

39
00:02:15.975 --> 00:02:19.850
Based on routes we can navigate directly
to these, if I refresh the page,

40
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.984
I'm still on about.

41
00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:27.175
So this isn't like a fully single page
app style where we can go to any page,

42
00:02:27.175 --> 00:02:31.614
but if we refresh it resets
us back to the entry point.

43
00:02:31.614 --> 00:02:37.998
This is, we enter in the path that we
wanna be at, and then it mounts as an app.

44
00:02:37.998 --> 00:02:40.114
We get that single page
app like experience.

45
00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:44.158
It's very app like no page refreshes and
all those good things.

46
00:02:44.158 --> 00:02:47.878
So that is linking and fortunately,

47
00:02:47.878 --> 00:02:53.159
the the linking and
Gatsby is Is just really simple.

48
00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:59.223
It makes me happy when an API works
like this because it feels easy.

49
00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:00.665
I like it when things feel easy.

50
00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:04.755
I shouldn't have to think very hard
about getting this stuff to work.

51
00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:09.989
What I should also show though,
before we move on,

52
00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.199
is something really cool about
Gatsby is if we refresh this,

53
00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:21.708
let me make this bigger so
we can see what's going on.

54
00:03:21.708 --> 00:03:24.709
Let me clear this and
let's refresh that page again.

55
00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.998
Okay, so we have our page data, right?

56
00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:34.736
Now watch when I hover over home,
to see how it just loaded

57
00:03:34.736 --> 00:03:39.576
that index.js it just loaded
the component that we need,

58
00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:43.349
so that when we click, it's already there.

59
00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.521
So this is another thing that Gatsby
is doing in the background when you

60
00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:47.397
hover over a link.

61
00:03:47.397 --> 00:03:49.594
It'll start prefetching data so

62
00:03:49.594 --> 00:03:53.678
that you don't have to wait as
long after you click that link.

63
00:03:53.678 --> 00:03:56.455
And a lot of times, I'm going to
go here and I'm going to click,

64
00:03:56.455 --> 00:03:58.109
that's maybe 500 milliseconds.

65
00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.485
500 milliseconds can
make a big difference,

66
00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:05.945
if something happens in under a second or
so, it feels instant.

67
00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.058
It's a very nice experience.

68
00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:12.354
And if the difference in me
clicking is one second or one and

69
00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:15.422
a half seconds in terms
of how long I wait,

70
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:21.404
that can make the difference between my
app feeling, a little slow, or native.

71
00:04:21.404 --> 00:04:27.308
And that's, the little things that we all
want to do when we build custom apps.

72
00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:32.306
But we don't have time for, and so
you just end not doing it right?

73
00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:33.309
Gatsby builds that in.

74
00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.472
So now instead of wanting to do it and
not having time,

75
00:04:35.472 --> 00:04:38.470
you don't even have to think about it,
it's just automatically there.
