00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.044
All right, so we've got our site
still running, we can move here,

2
00:00:04.044 --> 00:00:05.470
we can go to our about page.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.077
This isn't particularly useful right now,

4
00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:12.490
because we have to know the names
of these pages to get between them.

5
00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.506
So why don't we set up some links, and

6
00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:20.420
now there's nothing wrong with
just doing a plain old link.

7
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.480
I could do something like this.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.100
And I'd click it and I would go home,
but it does a full page refresh.

9
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.810
We don't want that, we want that
Gatsby kind of app like experience.

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.847
So what I'm gonna do to make that work is
I'm gonna use Gatsby's link component,

11
00:00:38.847 --> 00:00:42.440
so we can just import that
directly from Gatsby.

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.290
And then down here instead
of using an a tag,

13
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.600
I'm gonna use the link component,
and we use to instead of href.

14
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.885
In the link component so
we're going to link to home.

15
00:00:55.885 --> 00:01:01.216
And let's maybe use different
call this back to home.

16
00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:03.880
All right, so
now we have this back to home.

17
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.737
Now watch this tab index and watch
the fact that the page doesn't refresh.

18
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.500
It did everything so
fast that we didn't even see it, cool.

19
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.704
Here's the other part that it does,
is it's got this Gatsby announcer and so

20
00:01:17.704 --> 00:01:20.160
you see how it says that we navigate it.

21
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.030
So let's go back.

22
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.930
So we're at about this site.

23
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.365
So then when we click,

24
00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:31.070
here we go, navigated to hello masters or
hello frontend masters.

25
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.610
And that's sort of like what Gatsby is
doing to make things more accessible.

26
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.510
It looks like it's happening so
fast that we can't see some of it.

27
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.330
But that's the the gist
of what's going on.

28
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.470
And then we can do the same
thing on our homepage.

29
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.100
So let's just copy paste this link.

30
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.928
Right, and then we can drop this in here,
we'll do a link to and

31
00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:56.460
we're gonna go to about and
say about this site.

32
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.710
Okay, so now that we've created these
two links, we can bounce back and forth.

33
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.950
And you can see that what's happening is,
it's changing.

34
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.622
Without having to fully reload the page.

35
00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:12.491
So this gives us that app-like
experience that we're after.

36
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:16.192
We are able to navigate
between pages based on routes,

37
00:02:16.192 --> 00:02:18.610
we can navigate directly to these.

38
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.010
If I refresh the page,
I'm still on about, so

39
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.419
this isn't like a fully single page app
style where we can go to any page but

40
00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.680
if we refresh,
it resets us back to the entry point.

41
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.900
This is, we enter at the path that we want
to be at, and then it mounts as an app.

42
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.110
And we get that single
page app like experience.

43
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.220
It's very app like no page refreshes and
all those good things.

44
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.820
So that is linking.

45
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:53.045
And fortunately, the linking and
Gatsby is just really simple.

46
00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:59.235
It makes me happy when an API works
like this because it feels easy.

47
00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:00.755
I like it when things feel easy.

48
00:03:00.755 --> 00:03:02.965
I shouldn't have to think very hard
about getting this stuff to work.

49
00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:08.985
What I should also show
though before we move on,

50
00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:14.313
is something really cool about Gatsby,
is if we refresh this,

51
00:03:14.313 --> 00:03:18.850
let me make this bigger so
we can see what's going on.

52
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.720
Let me clear this and
let's refresh that page again.

53
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.283
Okay, so we have our page data.

54
00:03:29.283 --> 00:03:35.938
Right, now watch when I hover over home,
to see how it just loaded that index.js.

55
00:03:35.938 --> 00:03:43.262
It just loaded the component that we need,
so that when we click, it's already there.

56
00:03:43.262 --> 00:03:46.835
So this is another thing that
Gatsby is doing in the background,

57
00:03:46.835 --> 00:03:50.079
when you hover over a link
It'll start prefetching data so

58
00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.538
that you don't have to wait as
long after you click that link.

59
00:03:53.538 --> 00:03:56.263
And a lot of times,
I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna click,

60
00:03:56.263 --> 00:03:58.020
that's maybe 500 milliseconds.

61
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.630
500 milliseconds can
make a big difference.

62
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.950
If something happens in under a second or
so, it feels instant.

63
00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.150
It's a very nice experience.

64
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.378
And if the difference in me
clicking is one second or one and

65
00:04:12.378 --> 00:04:15.397
a half seconds in terms
of how long I wait,

66
00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:21.460
that can make the difference between
my app feeling a little slow or native.

67
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:26.851
And that's the little things that we all
want to do when we build custom apps, but

68
00:04:26.851 --> 00:04:32.350
we don't have time for and so you just end
up, you just end up not doing it, right?

69
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.330
Gatsby builds that in.

70
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.830
So now instead of wanting to do it and

71
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.240
not having time,
you don't even have to think about it.

72
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.470
It's just automatically there.
