00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.125
So Gatsby is showing us,

2
00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:06.065
it's building out everything that
we need to show these placeholders.

3
00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:10.240
It's giving us modern fallbacks,
it's giving us responsive images.

4
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.722
And it's giving us a placeholder in
case of JavaScript not being enabled.

5
00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:20.420
And we didn't have to do anything, we
just had to put in this static image tag.

6
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.993
So that's kind of what I'm talking about,
why Gatsby was so

7
00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:28.912
attractive to me when I first got into it
was because specifically, I wanted this.

8
00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:31.686
I wanted to be able to not
think about images but

9
00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:33.900
still get a great image experience.

10
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.427
So if I build this, let's just go
ahead and do an NPM run build.

11
00:00:43.916 --> 00:00:48.234
And then once that's built,
we'll serve it,

12
00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:53.851
Almost, there we go, now I can serve it.

13
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.701
There we go, so
we can open up this 9000 here.

14
00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:04.710
And if I, it may actually slow
down the browser artificially.

15
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.124
So I'm gonna switch this over to be
throttling, let's make it fast 3G.

16
00:01:11.124 --> 00:01:15.824
So the experience for somebody on a slow
computer, if I come over here and

17
00:01:15.824 --> 00:01:21.190
hit Refresh, is, see how it's got that
gray, and then the photo comes in.

18
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.560
So that's the dominant color.

19
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.551
We basically said,
what is the main color in this image?

20
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.182
Show me that.

21
00:01:26.182 --> 00:01:29.406
That can look really nice if you've
got a lot of photos on a page,

22
00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:33.330
they all have subtly different colors,
it can be really cool.

23
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.083
Another option that you have is, actually,
let's play with a couple of these.

24
00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:44.470
But you can see in here, if I go in and
let's disable JavaScript again.

25
00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:50.908
And if I disable JavaScript,
we're still on 3G, you can see it

26
00:01:50.908 --> 00:01:54.833
still got in pretty quickly,
we were able to get that image in.

27
00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:59.238
And most importantly, note that even
though we didn't have the placeholder,

28
00:01:59.238 --> 00:02:01.681
it still didn't cause the content to jump.

29
00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:04.529
Gatsby reserves the space of the image,

30
00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:08.056
so that the content is
predictably the same size.

31
00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:10.964
And that prevents that content jitter,

32
00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:15.765
we're not seeing I think they call
this cumulative layout shift.

33
00:02:15.765 --> 00:02:17.423
We're reducing cumulative layout shift,

34
00:02:17.423 --> 00:02:19.312
which is something that
makes Google very happy.

35
00:02:23.638 --> 00:02:27.560
So there we go again,
got that nice fade in.

36
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.227
Now let's try another approach here.

37
00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:33.496
I want to,
instead of using dominant color,

38
00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:35.998
I want to use one of the other ones.

39
00:02:35.998 --> 00:02:37.290
Let's use blurred.

40
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.959
And there's TypeScript autocomplete
here so I just did Ctrl+Space, and

41
00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.680
it let me see all these options,
so I'm gonna use blurred.

42
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.218
All right, so let's do blurred,
I'm gonna build again, And

43
00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:53.899
the build should be much faster
this time because we just built,

44
00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.909
which means all of that work
that was done is cached.

45
00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:02.490
So this should happen much quicker
this time than it did last time.

46
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.550
Yeah, there it is, eight seconds to build
that site this time, it's NPM run serve.

47
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.598
And now when we do this,
it's a blurred image that fades in, right?

48
00:03:14.598 --> 00:03:18.646
So it's depending on the images,
depending on what you're trying to do,

49
00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.976
you can get some really cool effects here.

50
00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:25.558
And let's just take a look at
the last one which is traced SVG.

51
00:03:25.558 --> 00:03:29.118
This one got a lot of attention for
a while, and then I don't know,

52
00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:32.880
I think people just stopped using it,
I'm not sure why.

53
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.943
But I've always thought this is a pretty
cool way to do it where it is going

54
00:03:37.943 --> 00:03:43.102
to take that image, find the edges and
make like a two-color traced SVG.

55
00:03:43.102 --> 00:03:47.756
So it's pretty cool, so let's build that,

56
00:03:47.756 --> 00:03:53.210
there it goes, serve it,
and isn't that cool?

57
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.783
It kind of takes the image and
does a little bit of jumping

58
00:03:57.783 --> 00:04:02.369
around to make it look like
it's kind of coming in soon.

59
00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.946
I've always thought that
was a cool approach.

60
00:04:04.946 --> 00:04:09.499
But anyways, for our particular purposes,
let's stick with the dominant color.

61
00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:11.200
I like that one.

62
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.427
So I'm gonna close this served one and
let's instead go back to NPM run develop.

63
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.980
So static images are great for
a lot of reasons, and the first and

64
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.138
foremost is that they're very
friendly to get started with.

65
00:04:28.138 --> 00:04:32.151
All we have to do is import this
static image component, and

66
00:04:32.151 --> 00:04:36.343
then use it like an image,
we can even take all this off, if I,

67
00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:42.787
Let's get this running, there it is.

68
00:04:42.787 --> 00:04:46.387
Get out here, okay, so
I can take all this off,

69
00:04:46.387 --> 00:04:49.824
let's just get rid of that,
get rid of that.

70
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.859
So no custom anything,
it just drops in that image,

71
00:04:57.859 --> 00:05:02.253
properly sized and
doing all the things that we want.

72
00:05:02.253 --> 00:05:04.684
I just want it to have
a little bit more style.

73
00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:08.938
So I'm gonna add those pieces in, and we
get all the details that we want, right?

74
00:05:08.938 --> 00:05:09.790
That looks nice.
