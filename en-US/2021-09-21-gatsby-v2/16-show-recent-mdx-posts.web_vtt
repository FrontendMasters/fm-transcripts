00:00:00.244 --> 00:00:03.727
Instead of what we've been doing, which
is where I've been like intentionally

2
00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:06.300
forming the site, so
that I can see a list of the blog posts.

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's actually build a list of
blog posts on the homepage so

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.182
that we can see what's been written and
show the latest posts.

5
00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:17.110
So I'm gonna come back out here, refresh,
I wanna show down here a list of my

6
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.037
latest posts, so first,
let's figure out how to get that.

7
00:00:21.037 --> 00:00:24.601
So I'm gonna go back into the GraphQL, and

8
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:28.563
I want all MDX nodes,
okay, that part is good.

9
00:00:30.087 --> 00:00:34.575
But let's turn this part off for now,
and let's get a few things that we need.

10
00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:39.143
So the first and foremost, we want the ID,
whenever you're querying for

11
00:00:39.143 --> 00:00:42.544
making a list in Gatsby,
it's worth grabbing the ID.

12
00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:47.136
Because you're probably gonna need to
set a key If you're iterating over these

13
00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:48.173
fields in React.

14
00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:51.688
If you wanna look up the posts, the ID
is the thing that's guaranteed to be

15
00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:53.969
the same, so
it's a consistent thing to grab.

16
00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.758
So grab that ID,
I also want the slug of the post and

17
00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:02.562
then out of the front matter,
I wanna be able to show the title.

18
00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:08.689
And I wanna show the date, or let's see,
we want the description for sure, and

19
00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:13.737
then let's get the date, and
let's do that like relative time.

20
00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:16.645
That should be everything we
need to build a blog role.

21
00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:20.097
So from here I can make a list
of here are my posts, and

22
00:01:20.097 --> 00:01:22.542
then you know what else we should do?

23
00:01:22.542 --> 00:01:28.454
Let's actually sort these, so
I'm gonna sort by the date.

24
00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.602
So here I've checked fields, and
this is one of the purple ones,

25
00:01:31.602 --> 00:01:34.536
I know the contrast is low here,
and I apologize about that.

26
00:01:34.536 --> 00:01:38.736
But under fields, we can choose one
of these and I want frontmatter.

27
00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:42.752
And you see these underscores indicate
that it's one of the fields inside of

28
00:01:42.752 --> 00:01:43.576
frontmatter.

29
00:01:43.576 --> 00:01:48.662
So we want the date and
I wanna order it by descending,

30
00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:52.628
so the most recent, post first, right?

31
00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:57.320
And if I change that to ascending, it
would show me the oldest blog at the top

32
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.167
of the list, so we're gonna go descending.

33
00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:03.228
So now we've got an ordered
list of our posts, but for

34
00:02:03.228 --> 00:02:05.687
now we're just gonna make it everything.

35
00:02:05.687 --> 00:02:09.598
And because I want this to be
a unique name, we'll call it,

36
00:02:09.598 --> 00:02:14.226
get blog posts, and I'm gonna copy
this and now we can use it, right?

37
00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:20.089
So we've got a list of these, so
I'm gonna go into the home page and

38
00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.040
let's use a static query again.

39
00:02:27.315 --> 00:02:28.430
We'll get our data.

40
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.583
Do a tagged template literal GraphQL and

41
00:02:37.583 --> 00:02:41.415
inside we can paste our query.

42
00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:47.874
So now that we've got that,
we have data and

43
00:02:47.874 --> 00:02:51.681
that's gonna contain all of our MDX posts.

44
00:02:51.681 --> 00:02:56.769
So we can pull those out,
we'll just put them into a variable so

45
00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.377
it's easier for
us to reason about we'll get posts, and

46
00:03:01.377 --> 00:03:04.748
that's gonna be data.allmdx.nodes.

47
00:03:04.748 --> 00:03:08.864
Because again, the way that this
works is we go data is the query and

48
00:03:08.864 --> 00:03:11.374
then we have the query name, so all MDX.

49
00:03:11.374 --> 00:03:16.363
So data.allmdx.nodes and then each
post is going to have ID slug and

50
00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:19.808
frontmatter with
the the details that we need.

51
00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:25.751
Then down in here I wanna
create a second level heading,

52
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:30.565
and we'll say check out
my resent blog post.

53
00:03:31.824 --> 00:03:36.766
And let's make a list out of it,
so we'll do an unordered list, and

54
00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:41.735
inside of the unordered list we
gonna do a post.map over each post.

55
00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:47.499
And for each of these,
we're going to return a list item and

56
00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:52.355
that list item is gonna
have a key of the post.id.

57
00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:59.618
And inside of it I want to use that
link component to the post.slug.

58
00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:03.149
And so the post slug is here,

59
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:07.279
that's the actual URL, right?

60
00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:14.706
And then we're going to link
to post.frontmatter.title.

61
00:04:17.452 --> 00:04:22.083
And then I wanna show when it was written,
so

62
00:04:22.083 --> 00:04:27.838
we'll do like a small tag and
we'll say it was posted,

63
00:04:27.838 --> 00:04:30.985
post.frontmatter.date.

64
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.989
Okay, so it will add that space for us so
that we can break it across two lines,

65
00:04:35.989 --> 00:04:39.961
all right, this is good, this should work,
let's go check it out, see how we did.

66
00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:47.654
Hey, look at that, okay, so now we have on
our homepage, a heading and the ability

67
00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:52.520
to get into our posts, and so now we can
actually navigate these posts, right?

68
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.507
So, this is where Gatsby really starts to
shine because we added this data in and

69
00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:03.906
because it's predictably
in our GraphQL layer.

70
00:05:03.906 --> 00:05:06.379
All the things that we learned for

71
00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.337
querying metadata still apply when
we wanna get MDX data, right?

72
00:05:11.337 --> 00:05:15.913
It feels very predictable,
the things we're doing are the same.

73
00:05:15.913 --> 00:05:18.601
We're gonna go to graphical,
we're gonna build a query,

74
00:05:18.601 --> 00:05:21.258
we're gonna copy-paste that
query into our component.

75
00:05:21.258 --> 00:05:25.318
And then we use that data so it you'll
start to see like these are the patterns

76
00:05:25.318 --> 00:05:28.247
that will carry you through
all of your Gatsby builds.

77
00:05:28.247 --> 00:05:32.734
It's really nice, really powerful,
you'll get a lot of mileage out of it.

78
00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:37.783
So why don't we commit our work there
because we're gonna shift over and

79
00:05:37.783 --> 00:05:39.870
start talking about images.
