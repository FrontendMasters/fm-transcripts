1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.397
So now that we've got our meta tags,
we've got a header on the homepage.

2
00:00:05.397 --> 00:00:08.302
You may have noticed that things
are getting a little bit messy here,

3
00:00:08.302 --> 00:00:11.472
we've got like these fragments hanging
around, this SEO tags over here.

4
00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:15.200
This one's got a header but when we go
to the about page, there's no header.

5
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.618
So our site has this kind of
like lack of consistency.

6
00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.506
I wanna fix that.

7
00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:25.896
So the next thing that we're gonna look
at is how to do shared layouts in Gatsby.

8
00:00:25.896 --> 00:00:31.952
And the great news is, it's just like
you would do it in any other react app.

9
00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:38.082
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
create a new component here.

10
00:00:38.082 --> 00:00:42.017
We're gonna call it layout.js and
inside of it,

11
00:00:42.017 --> 00:00:46.244
we're going to get all
the react goodies from react.

12
00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.155
We are also going to pull in the stuff
that we'll need from Gatsby.

13
00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.209
So like we're gonna create some links.

14
00:00:56.209 --> 00:01:01.136
We're going to move that header
stuff out of the homepage, so

15
00:01:01.136 --> 00:01:05.897
we'll pull the static query over here and
the graph qL tag.

16
00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:15.230
That was a weird autocomplete
from the Gatsby.

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.821
And then we're also
gonna need that SEO tag.

18
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.803
So let's pull that in.

19
00:01:22.326 --> 00:01:25.087
All right, so once we've got that,

20
00:01:25.087 --> 00:01:31.057
we're going to export a default component
called layout and you can make this,

21
00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:35.708
nope, you can make it a default,
you can make it not default.

22
00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:39.656
That's really up to you,
I am making it default,

23
00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:45.014
mainly out of habit, not out of
like any particularly good reason.

24
00:01:45.014 --> 00:01:47.902
I've just always used layouts
as default components.

25
00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:53.358
I think, yeah no rhyme or
reason to that just to preference.

26
00:01:53.358 --> 00:01:55.381
So a layout component
is gonna take children.

27
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:57.761
What children means is that when
you have a react component and

28
00:01:57.761 --> 00:01:58.965
you wrap it around something.

29
00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:01.716
So for example when we look in here,

30
00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:06.407
this main component is wrapped
around this h1 in this link.

31
00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:12.974
This will be passed through as
children to the main component.

32
00:02:12.974 --> 00:02:14.827
When we're wrapping with a layout,

33
00:02:14.827 --> 00:02:18.831
the whole content of the site is gonna get
passed through inside of the layout and

34
00:02:18.831 --> 00:02:21.187
we want that to be passed
through as children.

35
00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:24.975
So we're gonna go in and
pass through this children prop and

36
00:02:24.975 --> 00:02:29.774
then we're also going to set the title,
but we want it to default to false.

37
00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:36.043
And I'll tell you why in a second,
the description also false,

38
00:02:36.043 --> 00:02:41.629
the image, and
the path which will set to false, right?

39
00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:48.701
And then that is going to be, what kind
of builds out our layout component.

40
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:54.293
And the reason for that is if you don't
set these we wanna check if they exist and

41
00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:59.462
then default, if we made them an empty
string, or left them undefined,

42
00:02:59.462 --> 00:03:04.294
it's just easier to explicitly say
like hey if this isn't said just

43
00:03:04.294 --> 00:03:09.342
make it false so that comparisons
are not falsely but actually false.

44
00:03:09.342 --> 00:03:12.791
Inside of that we want to
move over this index stuff.

45
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:16.915
So let's grab this straight out and

46
00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:20.769
I'm gonna put it in here, okay?

47
00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.603
So now we've got that meta data and

48
00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:28.409
then we can start returning
our actual layout component.

49
00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:32.901
So what we're gonna do in here is a lot of
the same things that we were doing before

50
00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:34.656
we're gonna have a fragment.

51
00:03:34.656 --> 00:03:41.751
We're gonna have our SEO and
that's gonna take a title of title,

52
00:03:41.751 --> 00:03:45.880
a description=(description) and

53
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.529
image=(image) and a path=(path).

54
00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:56.444
All right and then underneath that,
we're going to put in a header and

55
00:03:56.444 --> 00:04:00.954
in our header I want to have
a link to our homepage, and

56
00:04:00.954 --> 00:04:04.479
that one's gonna be the metadata title.

57
00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.528
Then I also want to have nav.

58
00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:10.547
Now we're only gonna create
the about page today and

59
00:04:10.547 --> 00:04:15.291
the nav at least, and so,
we maybe don't need to do this, but

60
00:04:15.291 --> 00:04:19.050
I'm gonna do it just to
show kind of the pattern.

61
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.668
So we've got our nav item and then we're
linking to the about page within it.

62
00:04:22.668 --> 00:04:27.299
And then down here I'm gonna put in a main
tag and put the children inside that.

63
00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:32.463
Okay, so what we've done now is we've
set up our social sharing tags,

64
00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:37.198
we've set up a common header and
then we've set up a container for

65
00:04:37.198 --> 00:04:39.109
the content of each page.

66
00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:42.301
And this is gonna be
what lives in our layout.

67
00:04:42.301 --> 00:04:46.841
So to actually use that,
we can head over to our index page.

68
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:50.773
And instead of pulling in the SEO,

69
00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:58.646
we're gonna pull in layout from
components, layout.js, right?

70
00:04:58.646 --> 00:05:03.003
And then I no longer need
this part because this

71
00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:06.699
header isn't gonna be there anymore.

72
00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:11.823
The SEO is already taken care of, and we
don't need this closing main tag anymore.

73
00:05:11.823 --> 00:05:16.493
Instead we just wrapped
the whole thing with layout.

74
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:23.613
Okay, that also means I
don't need these anymore.

75
00:05:23.613 --> 00:05:26.331
So we can simplify this
component quite a bit

76
00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:30.087
by wrapping up that layout into
its own separate component.

77
00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:31.349
So if I save this.

78
00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:36.602
Forgot to call it a function,

79
00:05:36.602 --> 00:05:40.370
I got caught in between a few
different things there, yeah.

80
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.547
So we're gonna call this
a function layout and

81
00:05:43.547 --> 00:05:48.194
then when I come out here to index,
save, let's refresh the page.

82
00:05:48.194 --> 00:05:49.615
Hey, there we go.

83
00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.557
So now we have in our elements.

84
00:05:52.557 --> 00:05:55.939
We're looking at our header,
that's got all the things we want in it.

85
00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:58.776
And we've got our main,
which includes our content.

86
00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:02.765
And we've also got all of that SEO, good.

87
00:06:02.765 --> 00:06:06.407
Everything that we are hoping for is now
wrapped up in that layout component.

88
00:06:06.407 --> 00:06:10.559
So I don't have to think nearly as
much about how to make this work.

89
00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:16.816
So let's go over do the same
thing in our about component,

90
00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:23.597
so I'm going to import layout
from components/layout.js.

91
00:06:23.597 --> 00:06:27.352
And we will put the layout here and
here and

92
00:06:27.352 --> 00:06:32.609
then what I'm gonna do is
actually just keep that title and

93
00:06:32.609 --> 00:06:36.917
description from the SEO,
drop it right here.

94
00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:39.600
But we also don't need this main tag
anymore, so I'm gonna get rid of that.

95
00:06:42.515 --> 00:06:44.379
So let's save that.

96
00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.842
Let's head over to the about page.

97
00:06:46.842 --> 00:06:50.851
Okay, same thing we're getting
the title tag that we want, but

98
00:06:50.851 --> 00:06:55.456
now we have this consistent navigation
where the site actually looks Like

99
00:06:55.456 --> 00:07:00.455
it's a site, it doesn't look like
disparate pages kind of chunked together.

100
00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:03.968
And it also vastly
simplifies as you can see,

101
00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:09.619
this is way easier to deal with than
a lot of kind of strung out react code.

102
00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:14.079
Because we consolidated a lot of that
complexity of how the layout works

103
00:07:14.079 --> 00:07:16.899
of like, hey,
we need to get the site page and

104
00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:21.234
we need to do some like checking to
make sure that it actually exists.

105
00:07:21.234 --> 00:07:26.372
We got to set up this SEO tag, the basic
markup of having a header and a main.

106
00:07:26.372 --> 00:07:31.151
That's all stuff that,
we wanna care about that exactly one time.

107
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:35.496
We want our sites to be,
we wanna use semantic markup,

108
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:39.753
we want to set up these meta tags and
all those things.

109
00:07:39.753 --> 00:07:42.242
We don't wanna have to do
that on every page though.

110
00:07:42.242 --> 00:07:47.535
What we really want is, we want one place
that automates all of the semantics and

111
00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:53.065
the housekeeping of running a site, and
then abstract that away so that when we're

112
00:07:53.065 --> 00:07:58.370
writing content, this is all we have to
think about what is actually on my page.

113
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.649
And I just wrapped the rest
of it with the layout.

114
00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:04.114
That is a really nice workflow and
it's gonna add a lot of power and

115
00:08:04.114 --> 00:08:05.193
just consistency.

116
00:08:05.193 --> 00:08:09.359
Like if we've got people
across multiple platforms, or

117
00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:14.044
multiple teams, or having to make
content I don't wanna have to

118
00:08:14.044 --> 00:08:18.582
educate every single team on
which SEO meta tags are we using.

119
00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:24.362
Or like, what exactly do we wanna do in
terms of the way we markup the header?

120
00:08:24.362 --> 00:08:26.617
Forget all that,
just put it in the layout.

121
00:08:26.617 --> 00:08:30.467
One person owns that component,
everybody else can use it and

122
00:08:30.467 --> 00:08:33.959
now you get consistency
across the entire experience.

123
00:08:33.959 --> 00:08:36.637
So let's commit our work here.

124
00:08:39.739 --> 00:08:45.107
I'm going to head over to this one,
all right?

125
00:08:45.107 --> 00:08:49.956
Let's add everything and
I'm going to commit and

126
00:08:49.956 --> 00:08:54.116
say add and use a shared layout component.

127
00:08:54.116 --> 00:08:56.970
All right, let's push that up, okay.
