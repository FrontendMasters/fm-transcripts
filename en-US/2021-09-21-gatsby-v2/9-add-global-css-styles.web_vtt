00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.924
Now we've got what starting
to look like a website here,

2
00:00:03.924 --> 00:00:07.840
we've got this common header,
we've got navigation, but

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.400
clearly this is not styled,
we have not made this look like anything.

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.810
So the next thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna look at at styling Gatsby sites.

5
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.505
So the biggest thing when you're looking
at any site is you're gonna start to see

6
00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:24.021
global things,
you wanna have shared color palette.

7
00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:29.564
You wanna have your fonts typically are
gonna be set globally, you're gonna have

8
00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:35.260
some baseline like typography settings for
line heights and stuff like that.

9
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.317
So the first thing that you're probably
gonna run into in Gatsby is needing to set

10
00:00:39.317 --> 00:00:41.030
up some global styles.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.282
So what I'm gonna do is,
let's create a new folder, and

12
00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:48.215
this folder is gonna be called styles.

13
00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:55.375
In styles, we're gonna create a file and
I'm gonna call it global.css.

14
00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:00.275
And let's just make
some basic styles here.

15
00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:05.167
So I'm gonna use plain.css, this is
a stuff that you can use in any browser

16
00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:08.430
with the possible exception of like IE.

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.671
But we're using CSS variables,
which will make life easier,

18
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:15.170
I'll show you why in a minute.

19
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.860
But let's set a color for
our darkest color will be black.

20
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.067
We're gonna have a mid color that
we can use kind of a mid gray and

21
00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:29.207
then once said a white
we'll just go plain white.

22
00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:34.800
And then I want to clean up some basic
junk that happens in the browser.

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.104
So I want my borders and margins and
everything to be factored into the width

24
00:01:39.104 --> 00:01:42.260
of things so
that we don't get junk all over the place.

25
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.626
I don't know if we're actually gonna hit
that, I have to do this for every site or

26
00:01:45.626 --> 00:01:47.390
else I don't feel safe.

27
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.020
And then let's set up our basics.

28
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.130
So the whole color I want the text
color of this site to be gray.

29
00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.479
I want to use system fonts,
so I have a shortcut for

30
00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.939
this, no, my shortcut didn't work.

31
00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.746
[LAUGH] Maybe I don't have a shortcut for
this and

32
00:02:06.746 --> 00:02:11.510
instead I will copy paste it so that you
don't have to watch me type this all out.

33
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.500
This is the system font stack,
so we use Apple system.

34
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.747
BlinkMacs, Segoe, Roboto, oxygen,
this is all the different OSs,

35
00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:31.190
somebody took the time I think CSS tricks,
it's just some font stack, I think it is.

36
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.100
This is a really helpful little snippet
that I use all the time where it kinda

37
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.160
walks through everything you can use.

38
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.374
This is the one that I'm using,
there are other options out there but

39
00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:41.660
this one this one is handy.

40
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.610
After we've got our system font
I'm going to set the font size.

41
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.659
I want the font size to
be a little bit bigger,

42
00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.370
I like legibility I'm not
afraid to go with big words.

43
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.613
So let's do a line height as well of 1.4,
but

44
00:02:58.613 --> 00:03:01.950
these are just kinda
getting into preferences.

45
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.062
I want it to look somewhat designed,
we're not gonna go too far on this but

46
00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:13.060
I just wanna make sure it looks like we're
at least put in the old college try.

47
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.167
Have the body with a margin of zero so

48
00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:19.980
that we don't get that kinda weird
white border around the whole site.

49
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.870
And then I wanna set up for my headings,
I want my headings to be a darker color.

50
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.849
So let's go h1 through 6,
we will set to that color of black.

51
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.946
Okay, so I have done this, and
now that I have all of these styles,

52
00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:41.800
I wanna actually use them.

53
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.059
And there used to be a lot of stuff you
had to do this a little bit of rigmarole

54
00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.760
involved.

55
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.586
Now it's great you can
just go into your layout

56
00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:55.917
component, you can just import this, so

57
00:03:55.917 --> 00:04:00.764
let's just import styles, global, right?

58
00:04:00.764 --> 00:04:07.258
So I'm gonna import this style,
let's head back over to the browser and

59
00:04:07.258 --> 00:04:11.460
look at that,
we now have our default fonts.

60
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.020
Everything got a little bit bigger,
so that we can see what's going on.

61
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.440
And we're using the system fonts,
so that's okay.

62
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.960
I'm happy, I like that, I'm into it.
