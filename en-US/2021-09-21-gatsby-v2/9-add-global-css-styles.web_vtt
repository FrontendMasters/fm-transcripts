00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.290
Now we've got what starting
to look like a website here.

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.372
We've got this common header
we've got navigation, but

3
00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:10.210
this is clearly like this is not styled.

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.400
We have not made this look like anything.

5
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.810
So the next thing we're gonna do is we're
gonna look at at styling Gatsby sites.

6
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.827
So the biggest thing,

7
00:00:18.827 --> 00:00:21.940
when you look at any site is you're
gonna start to see global things.

8
00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.060
You wanna have shared color palette.

9
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.350
You wanna have the, your fonts
typically are gonna be set globally.

10
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.986
You're gonna have some baseline
like typography settings for

11
00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:35.260
like line heights and stuff like that.

12
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.569
So the first thing that you're
probably going to run into in Gatsby,

13
00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:41.030
is needing to set up some global styles.

14
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.250
So what I'm gonna do is,
let's create a new folder.

15
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.215
And this folder is gonna be called styles.

16
00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:55.375
In styles, we're going to create a file
and I'm gonna call it global dot CSS.

17
00:00:57.185 --> 00:01:00.275
And let's just make
some basic styles here.

18
00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.410
So I'm gonna use plain old CSS.

19
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.040
This is stuff that you can use in any
browser with the possible exception

20
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.430
of like IE.

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.840
But we're using CSS variables
which will make life easier.

22
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.170
I'll show you why in a minute.

23
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.860
But let's set a color for
our darkest color will be black.

24
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.147
We're gonna have a mid color that we
can use of kind of a mid gray and

25
00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:29.198
then once said a white
we'll just go plain white.

26
00:01:29.198 --> 00:01:34.800
And then I want to clean up some basic
junk that happens in the browser.

27
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.958
So I want my borders and margins and
everything to be factored into the width

28
00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:42.260
of things so that we don't get
like junk all over the place.

29
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.119
I don't know if we're actually gonna
hit that just I have to do this for

30
00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.390
every side or else I don't feel safe.

31
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.020
And then let's set up our basics.

32
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.140
So the whole color, I want the text
color of this site to be grey.

33
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.410
I want to use system fonts.

34
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.142
So, I have a shortcut for this.

35
00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:03.675
No, my shortcut didn't work.

36
00:02:03.675 --> 00:02:08.451
[LAUGH] Maybe I don't have a shortcut for
this, and instead I will copy paste it so

37
00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:11.510
that you don't have to
watch me type this all out.

38
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.251
This is the system font stack,
so we use apple-system,

39
00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:24.350
BlinkMacs, Segoe Roboto oxygen This
is like all the different OSS.

40
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.520
Somebody took the time I think CSS tricks.

41
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.190
Some font stack I think it is.

42
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.122
This is a really helpful little snippet
that I use all the time where it kind of

43
00:02:35.122 --> 00:02:37.160
walks through everything you can use.

44
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.270
This is the one that I'm using.

45
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.660
There are other options out there but
this one this one is handy.

46
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.610
After we've got our system font,
I'm going to set the font size.

47
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.270
I want the font size to be a little
bit bigger I like legibility.

48
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.370
I'm not afraid to go with big words.

49
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.718
So let's do a line height as
well of 1.4 these are just kind

50
00:02:59.718 --> 00:03:01.950
of getting into preferences.

51
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.240
I want it to look somewhat designed.

52
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.631
We're not gonna go too far on this, but

53
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:13.060
I just wanna makes sure it looks like
we're at least put in the old college try.

54
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.144
Have the body with a margin of zero so

55
00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:19.980
that we don't get that kind of weird
white border around the whole site.

56
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.870
And then I want to set up for my headings.

57
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.870
I want my headings to be a darker color.

58
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.894
So let's go our h1 through 6.

59
00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:36.770
We will set to that color of black okay,
so I have done this.

60
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.800
And now that I have all of these styles,
I wanna actually use them.

61
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.290
And there used to be a lot
of stuff you had to do.

62
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.299
There's a little bit of
like rigmarole involved.

63
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.740
Now it's just like it's great.

64
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.090
You can just go into your layout
component, you can just import this.

65
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.212
So let's just import styles, global.

66
00:03:59.212 --> 00:04:02.740
Right, so I'm gonna import this style.

67
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.150
Let's head back over to the browser.

68
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.834
And look at that we now
have our default fonts,

69
00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:15.020
everything got a little bit bigger so
that we can see what's going on.

70
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.080
And we're using the system fonts.

71
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.440
So that's okay.

72
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.500
I'm happy that makes me I like that.

73
00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.000
I'm into it.
